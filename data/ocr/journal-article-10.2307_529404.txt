News and Short Contributions Reports from the Field Underwater Test Excavations off Padre Island, Texas Introduction The work reported here represents the second and Elnal season of underwater test excavations in the area off the south Texas coast (FIG. 1) previously covered by magnetometer surveys by our agency in 1974 and 1975.' The survey area, which began at the mouth of the Rio Grande and continued north ca. 80 km., included a width of about 1,000 m. from the surf line to the 9-m. depth contour. The survey resulted in the location of numerous magnetic anomalies, the nature of which had to be tested by excavations. The causes of these magnetic anomalies were expected to, and in fact did, include modern shipwrecks, historical shipwrecks, geological phenomena and modern ferrous debris such as wire cable, lengths of pipe, and other discarded items. The rather complex instrumentation package and methods of relocating the sites are explained at length in earlier publications2 and will be only briefly sum- 1. J.

The survey instruments were a proton preces- sion magnetometer, a microwave radar positioning system, and a programmable calculator and X-Y plotter to provide real-time navigational guidance and to record vessel position and magnetometer readings on tape for later computer processing. The relocation of the anomalies for testing was accomplished without the aid of the leased electronic equipment by means of sim- ple trigonometry, optical survey instruments on shore, and a less sophisticated agency-owned magnetometer. Excavation was by means of a blower or prop wash, which sends to the bottom a stream of water generated by the boat's propeller. The highly localized artiElcial current generated by the propeller erodes away the overburden leaving artifacts exposed in place. The prevalent geological conditions of the area are ideal for this method. The overburden consists of a layer of sand and shell varying in depth from a few centimeters to one or two meters overlaying a bed of thick, dense Pleistocene clay into which, having sifted down through the sand, the artifacts do not penetrate. Test Excavation Objectives and Priorities The possibilities for test excavations on the south Texas coast remaining after the 1975 season were divid- ed into four priorities for the 1977 season and are listed below. 1. Test the 10-12 very significant anomalies located within 500 m. of the north jetty at Brazos Santiago, the entrance to the Laguna Madre. The location of such a large number of anomalies in close proximity also offered the possibility of experimenting with a newly modiEled, agency excavation barge, Discoverer, during a test excavation. 2. Test the remaining major anomalies scattered from the Rio Grande to about 17 km. south of the Mansfield Cut. 3. Test the strong anomaly near Yarbrough Pass south of Corpus Christi located during a previous magnetometer survey.3 4. Make further attempts to locate the ballast pile and determine what remained of a wreck identified as Arnold III, "Site Test Excavations Underwater, The Sequel to the Magnetometer Survey," International Journal of Nautical Archaeology 6 ( 1 977) 2 1 -36. 3. T. R. Hays and Eugene Herrin, Padre Island Project, Report to the Texas Antiquities Committee, Institute for Underwater Research, Inc., Dallas (1970) the Espiritu Santo (41 WY 3)4 which had been looted by treasure hunters in the late 1960s. Summary of Results It was clear from the start that all of the above could not be accomplished within the time and funding available; nevertheless, it was disappointing to discover that it was in the first priority, the wrecks near the jet- ties, that alterations in the plan would have to be made. Because of unusual geological conditions created by the pass, the deltaic nature of the area, and the jetties themselves, there was an unusually deep overburden of sand. We found that we could not effectively excavate in this area even with our most heavy-duty excavating device, the blower on the barge. We, therefore, fell back upon the remaining three priorities, each of which was carried out but with varying degrees of success. The testing of the remaining scattered anomalies revealed a few l9th century A.C. wreck sites and much modern ferrous debris. This phase of our investigations was successful in terms of locating cultural resources, since we tested all the remaining major anomalies, but the significance of the discoveries was not great. We were able to relocate the anomaly near Yarbrough Pass, "Sandy,"5 and quickly determined that it was of modern origin, thus accomplishing the third objective. Investigation of a faint anomaly remaining at the 1554 A.C. wreck site, 41 WY 3, soon dispelled the idea that it might represent the ballast pile. Rechecking with the magnetometer indicated a substantial anomaly which could only be a large ferrous object. Excavation revealed that the cause was a second large modern steel tank. It was the twin of the one discovered in 19756 and probably represents a second marker left by the treasure hunters in order to relocate the site after stripping it of all the iron artifacts. A single four-reales, Spanish coin was found nearby. The next several days were spent digging test holes in an organized radial search pattern around the tank found in 1975 near which four or five ballast stones had been recovered. Unfortunately, the only result was the recovery of one more ballast stone. 4. J. Barto Arnold III and Robert S. Weddle, Shipwreck: Disaster on the Texas Coast, 1554 (manuscript in preparation).

A shallow sand bar is an ubiquitous feature of these entrances in their natural state; the water depth is often no more than three feet. A vessel with the shallow draft necessary to pass over these bars would, when wrecked by running aground as most lost vessels are on this coast, end up in the surf near the beach as do the shrimp trawlers of today. A stranded shrimper within a few feet of the water's edge is a com- mon sight on Padre Island. We found very few anomalies in the deeper sections of our survey area most of the anomalies and wrecks investigated lying in- side the 6-m. bathymetric contour. Of the 35 anomalies investigated during the two seasons of test excavations, 34% represented shipwreck sites, 46% were caused by individual ferrous artifacts and debris, 1 1% are attributed to geological causes, and 9% (invariably tenuous in nature) are unexplained. In- formation on the anomalies tested by excavation during the 1975 and 1977 seasons is summarized in Table l. Forty other anomalies which seemed marginally prom- ising from the initial magnetometer survey data were rechecked by magnetometer and found to be of insuf- ficient significance for test excavations. The data presented in Table 2 are probably of equal importance to the archeological data gained through this project. There has been a long standing debate regarding the cost of underwater cultural resource sur- veys. Industry and some governmental agencies have maintained that the cost even of such surveys was prohibitive, to say nothing of the projected astro- nomical cost of mitigation procedures, such as test ex- cavations, which might be necessary as a consequence of the data the electronic surveys would bring to light. This project has proven not only that cultural resources are indeed present in our coastal waters, a fact which no one seriously doubted, but also that the cost of the sur- veys and of the concomitant underwater test ex- cavations need not be excessive. J. BARTO ARNOLD III TEXAS ANTIQUITIES COMMITTEE AUSTIN, TEXAS A Late Preclassic Monumental Mayan Mask at Cerros, Northern Belize Excavation in a small pyramid at the lowland Maya site of Cerros has brought to light a well-preserved polychrome painted stucco fagade dominated by a monumental mask. The fagade constituted the first well- preserved example of Late Preclassic Maya architectural decoration exposed since discovery of Str. E- VII-sub at Uaxactun, Guatemala, in 1927. Salient details concerning the fafade's context, dating and iconographic significance are reported. Cerros Excavation at the Maya center of Cerros, on the coast of northern Belize, (FIG. 1) has exposed evidence of sophisticated architectural decoration dating to the</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. 4, 1977 489 center is a plaza group focusing on a smaller pyramidal substructure, Str. SC (20 m. at the base, 6.1 m. high). Excavation in Str. SC uncovered the preserved fasade il- lustrated in Figure 2. Structure 5C Structure SC is a stepped pyramid situated on the northern edge of the center at Cerros. The structure rests on a massive terrace of dry-laid rubble which evidently underlies the entire northern plaza group (Group S). There are two major construction phases on structure SC, SC- 1 st and 2nd, both of which are characterized by out-set stairways on the southern side opening onto the plaza, and molded stucco facades on the basal walls. These basal walls flanking the stairways are highlighted in polychrome paint. The original fasade on the sw wall of Structure SC- 1 st was intentionally sheared off and buried in a hole in front of the wall. The second fasade on the wall of Structure SC- 1st was shattered by extensive root action in antiquity. The remains of fossil roots were found. The fasade on the sw wall of Structure SC-2nd, however, was preserved by careful, intentional burial in the course of Structure SC- 1 st's construction. Excavation revealed that the fill burying the preserved fasade on SC-2nd and the wall of SC-lst were laid down simultaneously. This rubble and gravel fill was punctuated by a total of 12 construction pauses represented by layers of pure marl. These construction pauses continue into the wall of SC- 1st. Chronological Placement of Structure 5C-2nd Excavation on the centerline of the two superimposed stairways of Structures SC-lst and 2nd yielded a cache of two large Red Sierra plates placed lip to lip (CM-SC- Cache 8). These plates were sealed by a plaster floor that terminates at the second tread of SC-2nd's stairway and underlies the lower treads of the stairway of SC- 1st. This same plaster floor extends out onto the plaza and abuts the southwestern wall of SC-lst. This cache appears to be associated with the final phase of con- struction on Structure SC (SC-lst). The lower treads of the final stairway seem to have been built over the plaster flooring which had already been laid on the plaza and against the sw wall of SC- 1 st. This interpretation would make the deposition of the cache one of the last events prior to the completion of SC-lst. The cache definitely penetrates the lower two plaza floors which are associated with the stairway and sw side wall of SC-2nd. It thereby provides a Late Preclassic terminus post quem for the preserved facade.

The center at Cerros (Lat. 18°21'00"Long. 88°21'10") consists of 51/2 hectares of continuous plaza and pyramidal sub- structure construction dominated by three large acropolises (largest substructure is 60 m. at the base, 22 m. high). Four seasons of investigations by Southern Methodist Universityl have resulted in the recovery of evidence that the center was largely constructed during the Late Preclassic period and subsequently abandoned prior to the advent of the Proto-Classic period (150 A.C.-250 A.C.).2 Attached to the northern edge of the 1. Research at Cerros during the 1977 season was funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation (BNS7707959). Supplemental support during the 1977 season, and support in previous years, has come from private citizens of Dallas, Texas, and other Texas com- munities. My special thanks to Mr. Stanley Marcus for arranging private financial support, and to T. Tim Cullum and Richard Sandow of the Cerro Maya Foundation for vital help and encouragement. Ad- ditionally, a small grant-in-aid was provided by the Belizean govern- ment to cover the costs of reburial of the fasade on SC-2nd. James Awe, acting Archaeological Commissioner and the Hon. Mr. San- tiago Perdomo, Minister of Trade and I ndustry, are gratefully acknowledged for this support and for permission to carry out research in Belize. The fasade on 5C-2nd was discovered and largely excavated by James Garber and Ted Wilson under my personal direc- tion. Their dedication, and that of other senior staff members of the project including Robin Robertson-Freidel, Maynard B. Cliff and Vernon Scarborough, has made the Cerros Project possible. Dr. Ira R. Abrams has acted as co-Director in charge of Social Anthropological Research for the Cerro Maya Project since 1975. No such research has been carried out under the auspices of the NSF- funded Cerros Project or is anticipated in future seasons.

I1ll, and from the fill between the wall of 5C-lst and the facade on 5C-2nd were Late Preclassic or earlier. The Fasade A total of 10 sq.m. of preserved faSade were exposed during the 1977 season. The overall composition con- sists of a monumental mask (H. 2.3 m., W. 1.5 m.) flanked by in-set panels depicting ear-plug assemblages and elaborately plumed birds. The main mask consists of three parts. At the top is a tight-fitting tri-partite helmet with a yellow/orange medallion on the central segment and swirling red horns on the side segments. At the base, framing the lower face of the main mask, is a grotesque with pronounced down-turned snout sur- mounted by a snubby anthropomorphic nose. Flanking the nose are heavy modeled brows which turn up at the edges of the main mask. These up-turned ends are bifurcated. There are red-on-cream panels on these brows surrounded by concentric red lines which may be interpreted as eyes. However, there are also black-on- red eyes painted in the groove which delineates the brows from the cheeks of the lower mask. Fangs are depicted in black and red paint at the base of these cheeks. Viewed in toto the lower mask takes on the appearance of a goatee beard on the main mask. The main mask is a grotesque with bulging eye pan- els, a human nose over a pronounced alveolar ridge, full cheeks, snarling, down-turned mouth with the lower lip touching the base of the alveolar ridge, and firm chin. Much of the detail on the main mask is rendered in paint, including the red-on-cream eyes with slit pupil, the black-on-red fangs, and the red-on-cream moustache. Paint is also used to highlight the nostrils, eyes, mouth, and chin. Taken as a whole, the mask is squared-off, rather flat, and shows a pronounced batter against the wall. Comparative Notes The faSade on Structure 5C-2nd shows iconographic</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 4, 1977 491 afElnities with Late Preclassic art from the Maya Lowlands and Highlands and with Early Classic (300- 600 A.C.) art in the Maya lowlands. There is a general resemblance between the mask on Structure 5C-2nd and those on Structure E-VII-sub at Uaxactun.3 In both cases the masks are squarish, flat, and show a pronounced batter. Certain differences in detail may be attributed to the use of multiple mediums at Cerros. Teeth, tongues and eyes on the E-VII-sub masks are elaborately molded. Comparable details on 5C-2nd are painted when present. Other differences are icono- graphically significant. Among these are the presence of a fully human nose over the alveolar bar at Cerros and the presence of bifurcated tongues and pointed upper incisors at Uaxactun. The most salient difference is in architectural context. While the E-VII-sub masks are uniquely placed on massive balustrades flanking in-set stairways, the 5C-2nd mask is placed on the side wall flanking an out-set stairway accompanied by elaborate friezes. The latter composition is well documented at Kohunlich,4 Tikal,5 and elsewhere as an Early Classic design convention. Structure 5C-2nd demonstrates the beginning of this convention prior to the Proto-Classic period. The flanking earplug assemblages and the presence of a lower full-face grotesque and elaborate bird imagery also point to essential iconographic con- tinuity from Late Preclassic into Early Classic Maya art. At the same time, the iconography of the 5C-2nd fasade shows strong afElnities with Late Preclassic art of the Maya Highlands.6 Indeed, the only motif on the fasade lacking parallels in Izapan art is the down- turned notch under the eye of the main mask. Interestingly enough, this element is well represented in Olmec iconography.7 The major contrast between SC- 2nd and Late Preclassic Highland Maya art is in the mediums employed. Although there is some tenuous evidence that architectural decoration was employed in 3. Oliver G. Ricketson and Edith B.

It is clear from Structure 5C-2nd and other more poorly preserved examples at Cerros that the Lowland Maya possessed a well-developed artistic tradition by the Late Preclassic period. This tradition, however, had radically different conceptions of monu- mental art from those found in the Highlands. Finally, the geographical distribution of this tradition, from the central Pete'n to the coast of Belize in the Late Preclassic period, calls into question the notion of a Pete'n based "heartland" for lowland Maya civilization prior to the Classic era. 8.

Special Studies Use-scratch Morphology: A Functionally Significant Aspect of Edge Damage on Obsidian Tools Examination of wear patterns on prehistoric obsidian tools at the high magnifications possible with scanning electron microscopy has revealed variations in the morphology of use-scratches. Experiments were per- formed to determine whether or not such variation can be profitably employed in the functional analysis of lithic materials. The results indicate that use-scratch morphology is a reliable and specific indicator of stone- tool function. Introduction Identifying the functions of prehistoric stone tools is an important aspect of reconstructing human behavior</page><page sequence="8">492 News and Short Contributions from archeological remains. With the publication of Prehistoric Technology, S. A. Semenov' introduced the basic methodology of modern microwear analysis, which attempts to infer function from microscopic damage on the utilized edges of stone tools. As outlined by Semenov, such damage can be of three kinds: polish, scratching,2 and microscarring.3 Since these aspects of wear vary primarily with the motions involved in tool use, they readily permit identifications of function such as distinguishing slicing from scraping tools. The differentiation of tools used to work hard materials from those used to work soft substances is also possible in most cases, but more specific identification of the material worked has rarely been achieved.4 To date, those studies that have attempted to make such iden- tifications have used low power (1OX to 200X) optical microscopy, and have relied on measurements of edge angle,5 on detailed examination of the disposition of use-scratches,6 on minor variations in microscar shape,' and on the appearance of microwear polish.8 This report discusses individual use-scratch morphology-an aspect of edge damage not previously recognized in 1. S. A. Semenov, Prehistoric Technology, M. W. Thompson, Trans. (New York 1964). 2. The word for use-scratch usually found in microwear studies is "striation". Since this term has a well-established and quite different meaning in geological writing, its use has been avoided here. 3. Microscars are small flakes (usually less than 2 mm. in length) that break away from an edge during use. 4. For a more extensive discussion of this problem, see L. H. Keeley, "Technique and Methodology in Microwear Studies: a Critical Review", WA 5 (1974) 323-36; and G. H. Odell, "Microwear in Perspective: a Sympathetic Response to Lawrence H.

Conventional Analysis I conducted conventional microwear analyses of obsi- dian blade tools from the Mayan site of Kaminaljuyu in Guatemala using low power microscopy and basing my identifications of function primarily on use-scratch orientation and location, and secondarily on microscar size, direction, and shape. Specimens were gold plated and then examined with a stereoscopic microscope with magnifications up to 80X. Use-scratches were dis- tinguished from random, non-use related scratching on the basis of clear, edge-oriented patterning (see FIG. 1). During this project I encountered difficulties in making inferences concerning the materials that had been processed with the tools under study. For example, tools showing wear diagnostic of sawing hard materials exhibited edge damage that varied from light to heavy. As Figure 1 illustrates, it was seldom clear whether such variation represented working a number of different substances, or the same substance with varying dura- tion or intensity. Since the majority of utilized blades from Kaminaljuyu fell into the "sawing hard materials" category, this problem was critical to an adequate behavioral analysis of the Kaminaljuyu lithic assemblage. Scanning Electron Microscope Analysis The need for more specific functional classifications thus led to a search for more reliable data concerning the material worked. Examining individual use- scratches at high magnifications was investigated as a possible solution to this problem. Previous microwear studies had not attempted to study use-scratch morphology because low power optical microscopy reveals only scratch orientation and location. At higher magnifications, lighting problems and low depth of field make resolution of an irregular surface increasing- ly difficult.9 I therefore employed scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which provides great depth of field at high magnifications, to determine whether variability in the appearance of use-scratches was present on obsi- dian tools. SEM examinations of a series of blade tools from Kaminaljuyu revealed clear differences in use- scratch morphology that were not visible at low magnifications, and thus had not previously been recognized in microwear studies.

I) might show any one of the scratch types illustrated in Figure 2. Preliminary examinations of other functional classes, such as slicing and scraping tools, indicated that a similar degree of variability was present within these categories as well.l° A series of experiments was conducted to determine whether use-scratch morphology varies with the material worked, and can therefore be used as a basis for functional inference.ll ln one set of tests, freshly struck obsidian flakes were used to cut 15 different materials, ranging from soft substances such as meat and hide to hard materials such as shell and soft stone.l2 A sawing motion was used exclusively so that the specific effect of the materials processed could be evaluated. Each experiment was repeated with three or four different flakes to insure that the relationship between the material worked and the scratch type produced was a consistent one. 13 All the materials tested produced microscopically visible scratches near the utilized edge, and all the flakes were then examined using SEM. Figure 3 illustrates a selection of the scratch types that were observed, and indicates that sawing different materials does result in different use- scratch morphologies. A second set of experiments, designed to investigate use-scratches on scraping tools, is in progress. Figure 4 shows the scratches on the leading face of two edges used to scrape different substances: soft wood and 10. A Cambridge 600 SEM was used. All specimens were cleaned with successive treatments of soap and water, benzene, and HC1. The presence and location of use-scratches were determined by preliminary optical microscopic examination. Gold plating of specimen surfaces was necessary to prevent electrical charging. A minimum of two hours was required for preparation, preliminary op- tical examination, and SEM analysis. SEM can thus never completely replace optical microwear analysis because of the obvious limitations on the number of specimens that can be processed. The use of special optical microscopic equipment (see note 9) as a substitute for SEM is at present under investigation. If equivalent observations are possible with such equipment, much more rapid specimen examination should be possible. 11. Odell, op. cit. (in note 4) argues that use-scratches are not likely to be good indicators of the material worked. 12. The substances tested include raw meat and hide (ram butchering), tanned hide, raw white potato, seasoned fir, green pine, seasoned oak, green oak, green maple, dry bone, fresh bone, dry antler, dry gourd, shell, and steatite. 13. For different replications involving the same material, the dura- tion and intensity of use were varied and in some cases grit was in- troduced. The predominate effect of these variables was to alter the rate of use-scratch development. Scratch morphology was relatively unaffected. Figure 1.

Tool types that group archeological specimens on the basis of scratch similarity should thus tend to isolate implements used for the same tasks. Although the specific nature of these tasks may remain unknown, such a classification would be of consider- able utility for the analysis of obsidian assemblages. For example, blade tools showing wear like that on specimen 2a are quite common at Kaminaljuyu, where they are concentrated at several distinct Early Classic (200-400 A.C.) localities. This suggests that certain crafts were localized industries at Kaminaljuyu by this time; analysis of the distribution of this tool type during earlier phases should indicate when and how such economic specialization developed. Identifying the par- ticular crafts that were the focus of specialization at Kaminaljuyu depends on archeological context, on ethno-historic research, and on further experimentation designed to replicate the wear patterns on these tools. The examination of use-scratch morphology at the high magnifications possible with SEM thus provides a new approach to problems that involve highly specific functional analysis. In this role it can make a significant contribution to the study of prehistoric economic systems in regions where obsidian was used for the fabrication of stone tools. Acknowledgments. I thank F. M.

Announcements Center for Materials Research in Archaeology and Ethnology The National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded two grants totalling $350,000 over three years to the Center for Materials Research in Archaeology Figure 4.

The clear differences between the scratch patterns on the two tools suggests that examination at high magnifications may allow specific material iden- tifications for scrapers, as well as for sawing tools. Discussion The kind of scratches present can thus indicate the nature of the materials that were processed with obsi- dian tools. This finding is of considerable significance for the functional interpretation of obsidian assem- blages. For example, a comparison of the archeological specimens in Figure 2 with the experimental ones in Figure 3 suggests that edge damage such as that on Specimen 2a may be the result of sawing some kind of green hardwood. The wear on 2b, on the other hand, is probably the result of sawing some softer, but resistant substance like dry softwood. Several archeological specimens (not illustrated) have been observed with scratching similar to that on experimental Specimen 3a, indicating that they were used to cut some soft, pliable substance such as meat or hide. Present results offer no indication of the kinds of uses that cause scratches like those on the archeological specimen in Figure 2c. Conversely, no archeological specimens have been observed that show sawing wear of the sorts produced by experimental work with bone (FIG. 3d) or harder substances. The scraping tools from Kaminaljuyu that have been examined using SEM all show wear like that in Figure 4a, suggesting that wood was the material that was scraped. It should be emphasized that these com- parisons are tentative ones. Exact replication of the scratch types observed on the obsidian tools from Kaminaljuyu is probably only possible in the environ- ment from which the tools derive, using materials that were available to the prehistoric inhabitants of the site. Even if specific material identifications such as these are not attempted, examining obsidian tools at high magnifications can contribute to the creation of ac- curate functional typologies. Tools used to work the same material should show equivalent scratch types despite differences in the duration and intensity of use, while a series of implements employed to work diverse</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. 4J 1977 495 and Ethnology (CMRAE), a new Center established by nine educational, research, and cultural institutions in the Boston area. CMRAE is a major undertaking whose purpose is to encourage a new direction for research in anthropology, archaeology, art history, and related humanistic and social science disciplines by providing them with an ex- panded technical base in the sciences of organic and in- organic materials. The NEH grants $200,000 for the Center's education program and $50,000 in 1977-78 toward a three-year planning grant of $150,000 for development of research programs will be supple- mented by contributions from participating institutions private foundations, and individuals. Participating institutions are Boston University, Brandeis University, Harvard University, the Universi- ty of Massachusetts, Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology, Museum of Fine Arts of Boston, Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology, Tufts Universi- ty, and Wellesley College. M.I.T. has agreed to serve as the Center's coordinating institution and as such will handle administrative matters for the Center. Heather N. Lechtman is Director of the Center. She will also continue to hold her current appointment as Associate Professor of Archaeology and Ancient Technology in the M.I.T. Departments of Humanities and of Materials Science and Engineering. Her back- ground is in the fields of anthropology, archaeology, art history, physics, and the conservation of archaeological artifacts. Joel Orlen, Executive Officer in the Office of the Provost at M.I.T., is assuming additional respon- sibilities as Executive Officer of the Center. The Direc- tor is the principal person responsible for developing the Center and its programs; the Executive Officer handles the administrative links with member in- stitutions necessary for the conduct of Center business. The research program of the Center will emphasize rigorous laboratory study of artifacts and other kinds of cultural remains in order to determine the nature and structure of the materials of which they are composed and the extraction and processing regimes they have un- dergone. The Center hopes to sustain a level of in-house research that will generate new insights into the ways in which societies have interacted with the material world and eventually to make its facilities and trained per- sonnel available to scholars from non-Center in- stitutions to assist them with their own investigations. CMRAE has no intention, however, of providing a staff to handle purely service functions, since its members are convinced that research aimed at un- derstanding the relations among materials, technology, and society will be advanced most effectively by scholars who have a grounding in both a science and a social science or a humanities discipline. I n fact, a primary goal of the Center is the establishment of education and training programs to increase the number of those extremely rare scholars who are capable of formulating research problems on the basis of a dual competence in a humanistic or social science discipline and in a physical or biological science. Schol- ars from non-Center institutions and/or their graduate students with a base in the humanities and social sciences will be encouraged to join the Centers laboratories on a visiting basis to work on their own materials while becoming acquainted with the proper- ties of those materials and with the specialized techniques of the relevant materials science disciplines. The Center's research activities will be carried out in a network of shared laboratories- including a series of materials research laboratories and a data-processing facility located at member institutions and used by students and faculty of those institutions as well as by visiting scholars and graduate students who will join the Center for shorter periods. The materials research laboratories are likely to include, among others, metallurgy, ceramics, lithics, palaeoethnobotany, and zoo-archaeology. Such laboratories already existing at member institutions will be expanded so that they can accommodate larger numbers of workers and research projects. One of the primary tasks of the three-year planning period is to draw up a set of detailed plans for the shar- ing and staffing of existing laboratory facilities for research in archaeological, ethnographic, and art historical materials. Eventually, such shared facilities should enable both coordinated research projects to be carried out research projects undertaken by a group of Center and visiting scholars as well as the smaller projects of individual scholars. Another of the most important activities of the plan- ning grant period lies in the area of comparative collec- tions. The permanent strength of the Center will rest not only with its personnel or facilities, but also in the quality and scope of materials gathered, prepared, and made available as standards for the analysis and iden- tification of archaeological remains. For all classes of materials from metals to bones, modern comparative specimens prepared under controlled conditions and/or gathered from living populations form the backbone of analytical studies, backed up by "libraries" of previous- ly analyzed archaeological and ethnological materials. Collections of the various materials already exist in the Boston area in one form or another but are generally maintained for nonarchaeological purposes by different university departments and museums. During the plan- ning grant period, the Center will determine the value of these existing collections for archaeological purposes, and, in consultation with those in charge of the various</page><page sequence="12">496 News and Short Contributions collections, will suggest how they might best be used and supplemented by Center staff. In addition, each laboratory will have to establish or enlarge its own collections of comparative materials needed for every- day or specialized uses by those conducting research in that facility. Definition of the scope of such core collec- tions as well as features of their organization, documen- tation, and storage will be worked out for each class of materials and a start made in assembling and preparing required items. During its first three years of operation, CMRAE will organize a series of professional seminars the pur- pose of which will be to explore the most pressing problems in the general domain of materials research in anthropology, archaeology, art history, and related dis- ciplines and to identify the creative routes by which the Center, as a coordinated unit of laboratories, can ad- dress and resolve those issues. The individual seminars will include specialists from among the leading scholars in their respective fields, representing Center and non- Center institutions. Although each seminar will address a different theme, all are expected to entertain the ques- tion of how a materials-laboratory orientation can stimulate and strengthen research in the fields that CMRAE primarily represents. The Center's education program is based on a four- year cycle of inter-institutional courses at the graduate level covering the primary groups of materials en- countered in archaeology namely ceramics, stone, metal, and Roral and faunal materials and the issues that revolve around the documentation and interpreta- tion of their cultural use. The cycle, begun in 1975, offers a graduate seminar in the fall followed by a laboratory course in the spring. Each year, both the seminar and the laboratory cover one class of materials and are designed and taught by groups of faculty from member institutions. Seminars are often enhanced by the participation of guest lecturers, specialists invited expressly for their research experience in the subject un- der study. Students from member institutions are eligi- ble to enroll in any of these courses. CMRAE is not a degree-granting institution, however. Students par- ticipating in its courses receive credit at their home in- stitutions. Thus far, the laboratory classes have been held at the teaching facilities available to individual faculty mem- bers at their own institutions. The NEH education grant, awarded to support the Center's education program, will permit the establishment of a central Teaching Laboratory as the primary facility for such in- struction. The Teaching Laboratory will accommodate all students in the program and will be used by all facul- ty teaching laboratory courses. Professor Lechtman is the director of the Teaching Laboratory which will open at M.I.T. in the fall of 1978. Although CMRAE is composed of nine Boston-area institutions, the Center is conceived of not as a local or regional effort, but rather as a locus of interests and facilities to further the objectives of a new field. It is in- tended that the Center be accessible to qualified scholars and graduate students on as wide a basis as possible, and that the organization of the Center evolve rapidly to reflect this potential national constituency. A program committee will determine Center policies and programs. It is composed of one scholar from each of the Center's member institutions and, in addition, two nationally recognized scholars who have not yet been designated. These two members will represent scholars-at-large from relevant fields and will increase the number of disciplines represented on the committee. Members of the program committee are: James Wiseman, Boston University; George Cowgill, Brandeis University; C. C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, Harvard Uni- versity; Lawrence Kaplan, University of Massachu- setts, Boston; Arthur Steinberg, M.I.T.; Edward Sayre, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Richard MacNeish, Peabody Foundation for Archaeology; Alexander Kaczmarczyk, Tufts University; Philip Kohl, Wellesley College; and, on an ex-officio basis, Heather Lechtman and Joel Orlen. The Center will conduct its business under the direc- tion of an administrative committee composed of one senior administrative officer from each member institu- tion. Members of the administrative committee are: James Wiseman, Chairman, Department of Classical Studies, Boston University; Robert Art, Dean of Graduate School, Brandeis University; Richard Leahy, Associate Dean, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University; Claire van Ummerson, Associate Vice Chancellor, University of Massachusetts, Boston; Walter A. Rosenblith, Provost, M.I.T.; Robert Casselman, Associate Director, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Richard MacNeish, Director, Peabody Foun- dation for Archaeology; George Mumford, Dean, College of Liberal Arts, Tufts University; Elizabeth Rock, Director, Science Center, Wellesley College; and, on an ex-officio basis, Heather Lechtman, Director of the Center, and Joel Orlen, Executive Officer of the Center.
