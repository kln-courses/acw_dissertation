YATES Iowa State University #NE OF THE MAJOR THEMATIC STRANDS in Huckleberry Finn is Huck's struggle with his conscience and his decision "to go to hell" rather than to assist in returning Jim to servitude. The part played by these events in Mark Twain's castigation of a society both pious and proslavery has been emphasized in a general way. Yet the manner in which Huck's inner conflict dramatizes the specifically religious elements in that society has been little more than mentioned. A recent commentator suggests a parallel between the "language of the official culture" in which Huck's conscience addresses him and the language of "preachers and politicians."' Few students of the novel have said even this much about the part religion plays in Huck's struggle and decision.2 An intensive study of Huck's moments of moral crisis concern- ing Jim leads one to see that Huck, whatever else he may be, is in a number of important particulars a sinner struggling for conver- sion; it leads further to the suggestion that he is indeed "converted" 1 Henry N.

In this paper a discussion of typical conversion patterns, of counter- conversion, and of Mark Twain's interest in changes of faith will be followed by an analysis of the climactic moments in Huck's battle with his conscience. Special emphasis will be laid on the religious aspects of that conflict. Attention will then be called to certain ironies, hitherto little noticed, that are revealed by this analysis. I Psychologists of religion have found that many conversion proc- esses include the following elements: i. A "sense of sin." 2. Attainment of inner unity, or "integration." 3. "An improved attitude toward others." 4. An inextricable mingling of conscious and unconscious mental operations. The unconscious self is manifested chiefly through habit- formation; the conscious self by the will.3 It will be seen that Huck's change of view includes all of these elements in some degree. In addition, his conversion is typical in that it takes place during late childhood or early adolescence. Finally, it resembles a number of recorded conversions out of or away from a religious life-in short, it is a counter-conversion. Whether that term was used in print before William James dis- cussed the subject in The Varieties of Religious Experience (I902)4 I have not been able to discover. Subsequent writers have cited the conversion of Robert Ardigo, a Catholic philosopher of the late nineteenth century, to scientific positivism.5 One author cites a woman "who swore that she never felt such a relief as when she gave up her religion, or rather the attempt, to convince herself that ' Edwin Diller Starbuck, The Psychology of Religion, 2d ed.

No claim is here made that Mark Twain. was interested in re- ligious conversion as an isolated subject or that he was familiar with any of the cited material on conversion or its opposite. However, the more typical ways of "getting religion" were widespread enough to render probable a general familiarity with them on his part, especially in view of his sometime attendance at the "Old Ship of Zion" Methodist Sunday School and later membership in the Presby- terian church in a town dominated by the major Protestant groups.' The expulsion of his brother Orion Clemens from the Presbyterian church in Keokuk, Iowa, for unorthodoxy may have sharpened Mark Twain's memories of his own early orientation. This expul- sion took place in May, I879, at a time when Mark Twain had probably composed the first eighteen chapters of Huckleberry Finn, including Huck's first crisis of conscience but not the second.8 And Mark Twain's interest in both conversion and counter-conversion, though under different labels, cannot be doubted. As a young man he had made mild jokes of his own falling away from Presbyterian orthodoxy;9 furthermore, in a paper read before the "Monday Eve- ning Club" of Hartford in February, I883, about a year before the publication of Huckleberry Finn, he included a discussion, later re- written for What Is Man?, that indicated a keen interest in both conversion and counter-conversion.1" As reworked for What Is Man? this discussion concerns an infidel who converts a small boy on his death-bed out of religion, then becomes a Christian himself and as a missionary converts a dying native boy from his ancestral faith into Christianity. 7 J.

In Chapter xvi he decides not to tell two white men that Jim is a runaway slave. In Chapter xxxi he writes a letter to Miss Watson which will inform her that Jim is being held by Mr. Phelps. However, he declares his willingness to go to hell and tears the letter up. In this willingness lies his perma- nent "conversion" into "unregeneracy." Huck's changes of moral attitude are foreshadowed in several earlier passages. In the first chapter he is attracted by Miss Wat- son's description of "the bad place," but her account of heaven, "the good place," leaves him cold. In Chapter iII Huck decides that there are "two Providences" and that he prefers the widow's, but as he sees the matter, Providence in any form is that of a slaveholding society and heaven belongs to the respectable.12 Because Huck is not respectable he finds it easy to believe later on that he is shut out from heaven. Foreshadowing of the ironic sort occurs in Chapter v when Pap Finn, having scolded Huck for going to school, says, "First you know you'll get religion too." Of course Huck already has "got religion" in the sense that he is a believer in heaven and hell, and he never ceases to believe in them or in slavery as an institution. But Huck's ultimate decision to turn against the Fugitive Slave Law would have been an offense to Pap Finn as well as to the proslavery churchgoers of the Mississippi valley. On Jackson's Island Huck rouses Jim with the news that a search party is on the way. "They're after us!" is his cry. Leo Marx has stressed the inadvertent use of "us."13 Even this early in their rela- tionship Huck has unconsciously formed the habit of identifying himself with Jim and is thus already beginning to think of him as a person rather than as a chattel. This habit is strengthened on the raft, where the two form what Trilling has called "a community of saints.""14 For some time Huck remains unaware of this step-by-step growth of a new attitude within the shell of the conscious view im- posed by piety and property. The new attitude makes a thrust "Witherington, Psychology of Religion, p. 77. 12 Cf. Edgar M.

His apology itself is an act of will but he is unconscious that any deeper change is involved than that of merely doing Jim "no more mean tricks." However, unconscious habit-formation is making Huck ready for a more reflective decision in which the will functions "to give point and direction to the un- conscious processes of growth.""5 Huck makes this conscious, willed decision for the first time less than twenty-four hours later. He and Jim are looking for Cairo and Jim is excited about being so near to freedom. The "sense of sin" is supplied by Huck's conscience, though this inner tormentor is not yet so much concerned with religion as with the property rights of Miss Watson. But Huck's expressions of guilt-feeling resemble those of various converts whose testimony has been recorded.'6 He says, My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever, until at last I says to it, 'Let up on me-it ain't too late, yet-I'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell.' I felt easy, and happy, and light as a feather right off. All my troubles was gone. I went to looking out sharp for a light, and sort of singing to myself. His feeling of buoyancy too is slmllar to that of some converts at the moment of their transformation.'7 Huck's feelings of release at this point give rise to irony because they are delusive; his true moment of conversion is not yet. Soon he is "all in a sweat" to tell on Jim, but Jim's avowals of faith in his friendship and promises quickly render Huck disorganized and irresolute once again, torn between his conscience and his more natural sense of Jim's rights as a human being. Shortly he is con- fronted by the two white men and asked, "'Is your man white or black?"' Huck tries to answer "but the words wouldn't come." His yet unspoken and half-conscious loyalty to Jim has taken over 6 Starbuck, The Psychology of Religion, p. II 2. ' "'Immediately I found a kind of judgment-seat set up in my conscience, where I was tried, cast, and condemned,'" declared one convert. See Dimond, p. 194; cf.

One recalls that in Pilgrim's Progress Christian's burden of sin fell from his shoulders and that he sang afterward.</page><page sequence="6">6 American Literature and finally causes him to answer "'He's white."' The moment of his actual conversion-really his counter-conversion-has occurred. Huck now shows a singleness of purpose which suggests that his "divided self" (to use William James's term) has achieved the unity which is the reward of the convert. There is a "release of power"18 which is shown in his renewed capacity for direct action and quick thinking; the two men decide to go and look at Jim but the "count- er-convert" heads them off with an improvised lie which not only induces them to stay away but even causes them to contribute "con- science money" for Huck's imaginary father who is supposedly ill with smallpox. Huck has such a deep sense of guilt that even this first con- version experience frees him only temporarily. He soon feels "bad and low" at having "done wrong" but his instinctive common-sense tells him that if he had "done right" by betraying Jim he would feel just as he does now. So in the future he will "always do which- ever come handiest at the time."'9 It is handiest to keep right on down the river with Jim. Huck's conscious expediency is thus an- other force working with his yet largely unreflective loyalty to Jim to bring Huck toward his final conversion. III Huck's second and final bout of soul-searching over Jim is in part a repetition of the first; the chief difference is the addition of a re- ligious element that is partly overt and partly unconscious. Since his first conversion Huck has read "considerable" in Pilgrim's Prog- ress, which he found "interesting but tough," and he has listened to a sermon about brotherly love preached to the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons as they sat in church with their guns handy. From some of these same gun-toters he has heard conversation about "faith, and good works, and free grace, and preforeordestination," and he feels that this was "one of the roughest Sundays I had run 18Glen, loc. cit. ' Mark Twain was to make much the same point-that the wages of conscience "is just the same" whether one does right or wrong- in What Is Man? and The Mysterious Stranger. See The Complete Works, XII, 27-28, and The Portable Mark Twain, ed. Bernard DeVoto (New York, I946), p. 670. In "The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in Connecticut" (The Complete Works, XIV, 302-306) the narrator finally squelches his conscience and enjoys freedom thereafter, as does Huck after his second conversion.</page><page sequence="7">The "Counter-Conversion" of Huckleberry Finn 7 across yet." He has attended a revival meeting at which the king pretended to be converted, and he has heard the speech compounded of "soul-butter and hogwash" which the king delivered over the coffin of Peter Wilks. He has also heard a funeral sermon that was "very good, but pison long and tiresome" and more of the pious rubbish of the king afterwards. Although there are no direct allu- sions to these events during Huck's second crisis, it is natural that they would act as catalysts to reactivate the memories of his earlier training at the widow's. It is not surprising, then, that pulpit termi- nology dominates Huck's thoughts during his second conversion despite having been almost absent from the first. Nor is it startling that Providence, the Sunday school, and the risk of damnation are explicitly considered here as they had not been during the earlier conversion. This second crisis is precipitated by the king's having turned Jim in to white law; the enormity of the deed (which the duke has abetted) shocks Huck into sustained reflection. Jim is being held at the Phelpses and Huck at first thinks of making this disclosure to Miss Watson through Tom Sawyer but rejects the idea partly be- cause of his natural sympathy for Jim and partly because he is still afraid to lose what little is left of his respectability by helping "a nigger to get his freedom." As the gnawing of his conscience in- creases, the first religious overtone is sensed in his use of the term "wicked." A moment later he is aware of "the plain hand of Provi- dence slapping me in the face"; he feels that "there's One that's al- ways on the lookout," and he quakes with the fear of "everlasting fire." The fear of death or hell and a "Feeling of Estrangement from God" are preconversion phenomena found with some frequency.20 Huck experiences the latter feeling when he tries to pray for strength "to quit being the kind of boy I was, and be better"-that is, for callousness in order to betray his friend. He kneels but finds that "the words wouldn't come."21 His loyalty to Jim is responsible for the blockage, but that loyalty is still, in the main, an unconscious one; Huck has not vet recognized his true feelings when he says that 20 Starbuck, pp. 49-50, 6I-62, 70-7I; Coe, The Spiritual Life, pp. 50-52; James, pp. I74, 176; William Warren Sweet, Religion on the American Frontier 1783-1840, II, The Presbyterians (Chicago, I936), 759, and IV, The Methodists (Chicago, I946), I27, 47I. 21 Cf. James, p. 200.</page><page sequence="8">8 American Literature he cannot pray "because my heart warn't right."22 Like many con- verts, Huck knows that he is "playing double" and holding on to sin. Having found out at last that he cannot "pray a lie," he is "full of trouble"23 and tries to gain peace by writing to Miss Watson that Jim has been caught. Once he has actually written the letter, he expresses his feeling of release in one of the more common pulpit metaphors: "I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now." Here is a possible echo from the camp meeting, where Huck had heard one of the preachers shout "'the waters that cleanse is free."' Here also is a figure used by other converts to describe their state of mind at the moment of the great change.24 But here, as in his first moral crisis, Huck's apparent conversion is only the prelude to a counter-conversion. Although he offers no explanation of why, having written the letter, he does not pray immediately, the reason is plain: his feeling for Jim is at the point of bursting into full consciousness. He thinks about how much he and Jim have been through together and of Jim's affection for him. It has been said that "In conversion . . . the new factors may be simply new to consciousness, but factors which had been already latent in the mental life."25 When he happens "to look around, and see that paper," Huck's buried recollections of experiences shared with Jim are the latent factors which suddenly leap into conscious verbalization and form a meaningful pattern. His memories, un- conscious until this occasion, have been collaborating with his partly conscious affection for Jim, and now, with memory and affection in conscious union, he is ready to perform the act of will which will thrust aside, the divisive force of conscience. The climax of Huck's counter-conversion occurs when he says, "'All right, then, I'll go to hell'-"and tears up the letter. In thus putting the welfare of a fellow-being above even that of his immortal soul, he demonstrates Starbuck's summing-up of conversion as a "process of unselfing."26 Having now achieved also the "unification 'Cf.

Dimond says consttutes the "moral victory" of the convert,27 Huck resolves to take up his old line of wickedness again-he will steal Jim out of slavery once more and in fact "go the whole hog" in transgression.28 IV Concerning Huck's second crisis of conscience, Edgar M. Branch says, "Ironically, therefore, Huck commits himself to Miss Watson's 'bad place' because of his intuitive sense of right, which agrees with the Widow's advice to help others."29 At least two new aspects of this irony are seen when Huck's decision is interpreted as part of a conversion pattern. The principal one, already dealt with, arises from the discovery that his backsliding into "wickedness" is actually a counter-conversion into what might be termed natural righteous- ness. The other lies in the fact that those elements in Huck's re- ligious environment which he has most thoroughly absorbed also contribute the most to his ultimate unregeneracy. Unquestioned by him has been the blending of church doctrine with the view that slavery was right and proper. He has also ac- cepted intuitively the orthodox view of prayer. In the catechism then prescribed for Presbyterian church schools prayer is defined as "an offering up of our desires to God, for things agreeable to his Will... ."0 The phrase emphasized by my italics is consistent with the widow's admonition to Huck that his purpose in praying should be selfless. Beneath its genteel trappings, the "widow's Providence" harmonizes with Huck's instinctive compassion and after he has helped the ruffians on the Walter Scott he feels that the widow would be proud of him. But in assisting Jim, Huck is torn by the contradiction in a religious way of life that approves of both altruism and slavery, although he cannot put it to himself in those terms. The result is a minor triumph of irony: first Huck tries to pray for 'The Psychology of the Methodist Revival, p. 205. ' One of the case histories of counter-conversion presented by William James (p. I48) resembles Huck's in significant ways. Like Huck, the girl in question is goaded to re- bellion against the Deity by an outrage that seems to have divine sanction-in her case, the brutality of a husband toward his wife. In both cases the resentment is felt on behalf of someone else. 'The Literary Apprenticeship of Mark Twain, p. 20I. " "The Shorter Catechism," p. 53.

The omission is mine.</page><page sequence="10">IO American Literature strength to help send Jim back to Miss Watson; one of his purposes is thus to do that lady a service. The widow could not logically have disapproved of his version of why he cannot pray a lie; such "playing double" as Huck does is not agreeable to the Lord's will and he knows it, and this knowledge contributes to his abandonment of any further effort at salvation. The widow would doubtless have considered Huck's altruistic wish to help Jim at the risk of hellfire a bit extreme, but her own advice has played a part in the develop- ment of that wish. Another aspect of Huck's training to which his wrong-way re- generation owes something is the Calvinist conception of eternal punishment. Huck knows that there can be no degrees of condem- nation; he therefore expects to suffer the maximum penalty. Since he has nothing more to lose, he resolves to help Jim again. Actually he has been aiding and abetting Jim's bid for freedom from the moment he first encountered the runaway on Jackson's Island. But the authoritative view of damnation aids him in the "unification of character" in which his consciously willed desire becomes the same as his previous instinctive one. Thus Huck's absorbing of three major elements in frontier fundamentalism-its endorsement of slavery, its views on prayer, and its version of hell-have been ap- plied in an ironically reverse fashion to bring about his counter-con- version into official reprobation and actual goodness. No two conversion cases are exactly alike, and Huck's conversion is lacking in several elements found in many. He shows no special desire to love God or to achieve union with Him. Christ is not even mentioned; Satan too as an anthropomorphic force is absent from his reflections. Nevertheless Huck's experience in reaching his de- cision may be viewed either as an incomplete conversion followed by backsliding or as a counter-conversion which turns out to be perma- nent. By presenting part of Huck's moral growth within the pat- tern of a religious phenomenon that was widespread in rural Amer- ica, and in a sense, by turning that pattern upside-down, Mark Twain supplied ingredients in the irony of the novel which deserve closer attention.</page></plain_text>
