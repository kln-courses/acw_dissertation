Pin Ups is the last of Bowie’s “Ziggy  Stardust” albums—three in all, which feature Bowie in the guise  of an androgynous space-alien rock star along with a band called  The Spiders from Mars.1 The female model shown on the front al- bum cover of Pin Ups is none other than Twiggy, the number-one  pin-up girl of 1960s “swinging London” (see fi g. 1). But Twiggy is  made to look nearly like Ziggy (the rhyme of these names is not  coincidental).2 Or is it Bowie/Ziggy who is made to look nearly  like Twiggy? Who is covering whom? Or as Judith Butler might  ask rhetorically, which is the original and which the copy?3 This  Butlerian question, which refers to heterosexual gender norms set  over and against drag, is an appropriate one for the album cover,  but less so for the album’s content. Although we may wish to trou- ble the concepts of “original” and “copy” in the realm of gender  theory, in the realm of music and the history of the cover song  these terms carry indisputable and sometimes material signifi cance,  such that probing the relationship between “original” and “copy”  results in sharp distinctions rather than ambiguities.4 Cover songs  were prevalent in the early years of rock and roll when recording  practices colluded with the segregationist practices of format ra- dio stations catering to regional white audiences. Songs recorded  fi rst by African American musicians were frequently re-recorded  by white artists who bleached out the threatening blackness from  the vocals and sanitized the lyrics while appropriating the rhyth- mic vigor, melodic inventiveness, and potential market share of the  originals.5 As radio audiences and the music industry became more  integrated, cover songs came to signify both individual interpreta- tion and homage to a past or peer musician. Some covers, such as  Jimi Hendrix’s version of Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtow- er,” have reached canonical status. The Hendrix “Watchtower”  brought together two of rock’s most vaunted and archetypal fi g- ures—an African American guitar virtuoso and a white rebellious  iconoclast—in a monumental blues ballad that neatly redressed the  early, more pernicious history of cover songs.6 None of the cover songs on Bowie’s Pin Ups achieved canonical  </page> <page sequence="3"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 153 status; in fact, the album has been mostly dismissed as a pointless  fi ller released while Bowie was shifting to a new persona and a new  backup band.7 Yet we can also read this album as the apogee of his  Ziggy Stardust period—indeed, his statement on the image-making  of rock stardom. With the title Pin Ups and his pose with Twiggy,  David Bowie invites the listener to think of these songs not just as  covers but also as visual objects, as images designed for idoliza- tion. He places himself in the role of consumer and fan as much as  creator or interpreter.       Two cans of Campbell’s Soup, one depicted in a tight close-up, the  other in a long shot, both fl oating in the same blank background,  isolated only by the thin vertical line formed by the physical sepa- ration of the two painted panels. Flatness in one frame combines  with an illusion of space, a bid for a depth of fi eld, in the other.       Fig. 2. Andy Warhol, Campbell’s Soup Cans (Chicken with Rice, Bean  with Bacon), 1962.

But in the diptych, the surrounding fi eld  is white canvas, without horizon lines, topography, or vanishing  point outside the can itself. There is no nature, no context, except  for the other can in the pair. They are, importantly, two different  fl avors of soup and, moreover, they are both “companion soups”  that is, “chicken with rice” and “bean with bacon.” Indeed, the  diptych evokes a drama of companionship and estrangement, but  confi gured as a superfi cial relation and simple juxtaposition; in  other words, it is all about posing, as in both position and impos- ture. These soup cans, in their two cinematic stances, stand for hu- man beings in the same way that Bowie and Twiggy, in their near  reproduction of each other, stand for commercial products.8 It may seem a stretch to compare David Bowie to Andy War- hol; however, Bowie studied Warhol and his notorious entourage  of speed freaks and transvestites as he contrived his character Zig- gy Stardust, and he documented his idolization of Warhol in song  nearly a year before they met in September 1971.9 (Later Bowie  would impersonate Warhol in the 1996 movie Basquiat.) David  Bowie might well be considered the Warhol of the rock world.  Warhol’s vacuous and “swish” behavior, and his use of consum- er items and pop icons in his art, contrasted with the masculinist  rugged individualism of Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, and  other modernist art trends.10 Similarly, Bowie’s decidedly nostalgic  musical styles coupled with androgynous costumes, staged homo- eroticism, and proclamations of his own gay or bi sexuality con- trasted with the prevailing masculinist subculture that dominated  British rock in the mid to late 1960s—namely the London “mods”  (short for “moderns”), which spawn bands such as the Small Fac- es, the Yardbirds, the Rolling Stones, and, most emblematically,  The Who. In answer to modernists and mods, respectively, both  Warhol and Bowie played on the line between art and commercial  </page> <page sequence="5"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 155 product, between earnest and ironic expression, and between sur- face presentation and deeper meaning—especially via the insinua- tion of queer sexuality. Warhol’s infl uence on Bowie’s calculated self-construction and  media savvy has been noted by scholars steeped in the Marxist and  sociological concerns of British cultural studies. Simon Frith and  Howard Horne noted that “Bowie described his own work in War- hol-like terms . . . [he] became a blank canvas on which consumers  write their dreams.”11 David Buckley asserts that Warhol’s non- committal attitude coupled with an aggressive self-promotion was  “a paradigm of posing that Bowie found irresistible.”12 Van M.  Cagle argues that Bowie repackaged Warhol’s subcultural world of  polymorphous sexuality and gender ambiguity for mass consump- tion as mere posing, which nonetheless instigated explorations of  sexual identity on a mass scale, even if a shallow one (RP/S, 13).13  But these observations stop short of aesthetic and theoretical in- quiry. What does it mean to say that Warhol’s posing was original,  and Bowie’s posing was a copy? The concept of “posing” has not garnered much treatment in  queer theory, unlike the concept of “performance,” rigorously pur- sued by Judith Butler. Butler’s theory of gender as the “stylized  repetition” of discrete acts radically redefi nes performance from a  theatricality that contrasts with everyday life to a mundanity that  constitutes everyday life.14 This shift calls attention to the construct- edness of “authentic” and “natural” behavior, but it also replaces  these with a naturalized concept of performance. Performance is  thorough, we might even call it “deeply rooted.” There is no in- ternal, psychic life that is not somehow staged by culture. Posing,  however, insists on self-awareness, image, and surface and keeps in  place the temporal and material positions of “original” and “copy.”  Posing does not displace Butler’s performance; rather, it describes  one mechanism for the creation of dissident styles, which she recog- nizes as a possible local strategy of resistance to norms.15 In what follows I examine how Warhol’s art pertains to Bowie’s  music, and what their “paradigm of posing” means for an articu- lation of sexuality in the principal media of their day—on canvas  and on vinyl. I also explore the resonances and parallels between  </page> <page sequence="6"> 156 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   “sound and vision” (to quote a Bowie song) and attempt to think  imaginatively about music (and with images) in ways that Bowie’s  songs invite, especially the cover songs from Pin Ups, his most War- holian album. Throughout this essay I will juxtapose the visual and  the musical, from the initial discussion of concepts and histories  to the later discussion of songs and paintings. This is a playful ex- ploration, not intended as an exhaustive accounting of Warhol’s or  Bowie’s careers or the historical record of their contact. I am using  one medium to access another—more specifi cally, to understand the  challenge to the standard vocabularies of artistic expressivity posed  by Warhol in painting, and perpetuated by Bowie in song.       “To be natural is such a very diffi cult pose to keep up.” —Oscar Wilde       “Posing” commonly refers to a positioning of the body or an ob- ject in space, which itself can take on meaning. For theorists of  visual culture, posing functions within an interaction among cre- ator, spectator, and the object of the gaze—an interaction that is  already saturated with implications of power and desire. Impor- tantly, to “strike a pose” is to stop the action of the body, to al- low the viewer to become absorbed in visual pleasure and desire,  and also to allow the poser the pleasure of inhabiting the object  position. In psychoanalytic theory, which informs many theories  of visual culture, the phallus is the signifi er par excellence for de- sire, and to pose—to become the object of desire—is to become  phallic. Woman, paradoxically, generates this symbolic order; as  Laura Mulvey notes, “it is her lack that produces the phallus as  a symbolic presence.” Mulvey’s classic theory of the “male gaze”  posits that “[i]n a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in  looking has been split between active/male and passive/female. . . .  [W]omen are simultaneously looked at and displayed . . . so that  they can be said to connote to-be-looked-at-ness.”16 Within this  theory of visual pleasure, male objects of the gaze cannot escape  a degree of feminization, frequently compensated for by an overt  phallic display.17 This is especially evident with rock guitarists,  whose instrument provides an obvious, elongated phallus and gives  </page> <page sequence="7"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 157 them the literal power to move from one side of the stage to the  other, and to pose at will. Keyboard players asserted their phallic  display in other ways: Little Richard posed with his leg stretched  out and resting atop the piano. Although “Ziggy played guitar,” as the lyric proclaims, David  Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust performances rarely did. Infl uenced by  his training in mime theater, Bowie moved from one dramatic pose  to the next while he sang; his tight physical control and position- ing of his body contrasted starkly with other lead singers of the  era—the exaggerated strutting of Mick Jagger, the ecstatic shud- ders and head shaking of Robert Plant, and the fi st-pumping and  microphone swinging of Roger Daltrey.18 The theatrics of Bowie’s  shows included pantomimed routines that visually echoed not any  of those fi gures, but rather the early performances of Jimi Hendrix:  guitarist Mick Ronson would straddle Bowie as Hendrix had his  guitar, and Bowie would pick Ronson’s guitar with his teeth as it  hung close to Ronson’s groin, turning Hendrix’s stylized cunnilin- gus with the guitar into fellatio with the guitarist. In the realm of everyday life, the pose of the body offers a cor- poreal code, especially among subcultures. Sociologist Dick Heb- dige describes how the stiff poses of working-class mods in the  mid-1960s communicated defi ance, but also turned “the fact of be- ing under scrutiny into the pleasure of being watched.” He writes,  “[t]he posture is auto-erotic: the self becomes the fetish. There is  even a distinctive mod way of standing. According to one original  mod, ‘feet had to be right. If you put your hands in your pocket,  you never pulled the jacket up so it was wrinkled. . . .’ The circle  has now been fully described; fractions of youth now aspire to the  fl atness and the stillness of a photograph. They are completed only  through the admiring glances of a stranger.”19 For youth subcultures such as the mods, and later skinheads  and punks, to “strike a pose” was to “pose a threat,” for as Craig  Owens describes, “confronted with a pose, the gaze itself is im- mobilized, brought to a standstill.”20 Similarly threatening, but on  the other side of the gender spectrum, lies the corporeal code of  the stereotypically effeminate “pose of the queer” in the fi rst half  of the twentieth century: men with hands on hips, arms akimbo,  </page> <page sequence="8"> 158 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   presented an image of limp and “bent” bodies in opposition to stiff  and “straight” ones. To “swish” was to animate this pose with  a mincing walk and fl uid gestures, serving to advertise one’s gay  sexuality and subcultural identity as a “fairy” in opposition to the  queer but “normal” counterparts, or ostensibly straight “trade.”21 The New York art scene from the early 1940s through the late  1950s was notoriously macho, dominated by the hard-drinking  and brawling Jackson Pollock (d. 1956), whom Life magazine pro- fi led in a famous 1949 article that featured a picture of the artist in  a cocky pose wearing jeans and a work shirt, leaning against one of  his paintings, legs crossed, arms folded, cigarette drooping from his  mouth.22 By contrast, Andy Warhol, who moved to New York as a  commercial artist in 1952 and began painting in 1960, was notori- ously “swish” in his manner of speech and body language. Warhol  later admitted to exaggerating this behavior: “You’d have to have  seen the way all the Abstract Expressionist painters carried them- selves and the kinds of images they cultivated, to understand how  shocked people were to see a painter coming on swish. I certainly  wasn’t a butch kind of guy by nature, but I must admit I went out  of my way to play up the other extreme.”23 (Warhol reported that  his “swish” alienated his fellow gay artists Jasper Johns and Rob- ert Rauschenberg; P, 11–12.) Bowie too went out of his way to  look and speak as queeny as possible. Melody Maker’s feature sto- ry on Bowie in the January 22, 1972, issue proclaimed him “rock’s  swishiest outrage: a self-confessed lover of effeminate clothes.”24  Before meeting members of Warhol’s entourage, or Warhol him- self, Bowie had extended the late-1960s unisex fashions to their  transgender extremes: the loose-fi tting patterned shirts, long hair,  and less masculine or “sensitive” demeanor of the hippies became  Bowie’s ankle-length dress, fl oppy hat, cascading Veronica Lake  hairdo, and the wilted poses of early Hollywood starlets. After a  visit to the surreal environment of Warhol’s Factory, and infl uenced  by scenesters at London’s gay club the Sombrero, Bowie’s gender  bending became androgynous and otherworldly, further removed  from the counterculture and its compulsory heterosexuality.25 Both the stiff and self-contained postures of Pollock and the Brit- ish mods and the “swish” of Warhol and Bowie represent a pose  </page> <page sequence="9"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 159 with gesture, carriage, and voice that blurs into the other meaning  of posing—posing as behavior. As a term of behavior, “posing”  connotes mimicry, imposture, bound up with colonization and cul- tural theft (hence its negative connotations).26 Treatments of pos- ing and poseurs appear in sociological literature investigating the  formation and commodifi cation of subcultural styles; an excel- lent defi nition of “poseurs” occurs in an article from 1960 titled  “When Do We Begin Teaching Beatnik Poetry?” According to the  author, poseurs are “people whose way of life has brought them,  at best, limited satisfaction and who, under the cover of a new  name, seek identifi cation for themselves while they continue to live  as they formerly have done.”27 From the point of view of the po- seur, the donning of a new name and new identity offers aesthetic  satisfaction—a lifestyle that does not actually impinge on life. This  seems a perfect description of Bowie’s “coming out”: in the same  1972 Melody Maker interview that called Bowie “rock’s swishiest  outrage,” Bowie states forthrightly: “I’m gay . . . and always have  been, even when I was David Jones” (“OY,” 19).28 Although Bow- ie insists here that his homosexuality preceded and endured even  through his change of name and identity—from his family given  name of Jones to his self-given celebrity name “Bowie”—he had  recently married (March 1970), fathered a child (born May 1971),  and openly shunned gay politics.29 Biographers disagree about the  extent of Bowie’s homosexual relationships during the 1970s (he  renounced his homosexuality in 1983).30 Michel Watts already  doubted the veracity of Bowie’s words in 1972, saying, “Don’t dis- miss David Bowie as a serious musician just because he likes to put  us all on a little” (“OY,” 42). But can a poseur also be a “serious musician”? Seriousness im- plies dignity, gravity, dedication, earnestness—not, it would seem,  the stuff of poseurs. Sociologists Ryan Moore and Sarah Thornton,  studying youth subcultures that organize around music, note that  the fi gure of the poseur emerges at the stage when the rebellious  features of the music and visual style enter mainstream media and  fashions. Poseurs are consumers, not producers of the subculture;  imitators, not originators. They are derivative, shallow, and pas- sive; as such they are always already feminized.31 </page> <page sequence="10"> 160 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   The masses and mass culture have been ascribed “pejorative  feminine characteristics” since the late nineteenth century, set  in opposition to the Nietzschean masculine fi gure of the “artist- philosopher-hero.” Andreas Huyssen argues that this binary op- position reached its height in the 1950s and 1960s, where “[t]he  nightmare of being devoured by mass culture through co-optation,  commodifi cation, and the ‘wrong’ kind of success is the constant  fear of the modernist artist, who tries to stake out his territories  by fortifying the boundaries between genuine art and inauthentic  mass culture.”32       Wildly curving lines, free-form drips, and splotches of color defy  the confi nes of the picture frame and convey the bodily actions of  the artist—the only fi gure that still haunts the painting. Aluminum  and enamel paints create richly textured layers that tangle back- ground and foreground into a dynamic visual fi eld.       Fig. 3. Jackson Pollock, Number 1, 1949.

Pollock employed a fl at,  gestural, and arcane visual language that nevertheless supposedly  revealed psychological if not also primal depths through urgent  calligraphic fl ourishes that encoded a struggle to control irrational  forces, to grapple with the material world and the embattled con- dition of modern man. Though abstract, Pollock’s paintings were  seen to project a “bursting masculinity” (as one 1958 catalog essay  noted)—an obvious attempt to counter the Cold War stereotype  of artists as sissies or homosexuals, and potentially communists.33 Musicians have been painted with the same queer brush as art- ists, however, and at least one British rock band emerging in the  1960s enacted similar masculinist modernist strategies for combat- ing what Leerom Medvoi describes as “the ever-present danger of  selling out to the feminizing horror of pop.”34 As teenagers in the  mid to late 1950s, the members of The Who were among the fi rst  generation of postwar British youth to consume early American  rhythm and blues and rock and roll. American modernist paint- ing and American rock and roll arrived in the United Kingdom  at exactly the same time. In 1956 the Tate Gallery featured the  show “Modern Art in the United States,” which included works by  Pollock and other Abstract Expressionists—the same year the fi lm  Rock Around the Clock opened in England and started a Bill Hal- ey craze among gangs of young men called “Teddy boys” on ac- count of their neo-Edwardian fashions. The Who formed in 1964  and consciously styled themselves as a mod band. Songwriter Pete  Townsend, a onetime London art student (he claimed to have met  Pollock), crafted new, distinctly Anglo-British mod anthems ex- pressing a brutish and nationalistic masculinity, which countered  the romanticism and mass-marketed appeal of their famous near  contemporaries, the Beatles.35 With the use of mass-media images of consumer products, per- sonalities and icons, and symbols such as fl ags and targets, Pop  Art challenged the distinction between high art and low commod- ity, individual expression and corporate advertisement. British art- ists such as Eduardo Paolozzi, Richard Hamilton, and Peter Blake  </page> <page sequence="12"> 162 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   were among the fi rst to produce such art in the 1950s, embracing  the infl ux of American popular culture and technology. Their col- lages subtly critiqued commodifi ed gender as Charles Atlas and  pin-up girls stood for the domestic couple, and eroticized vacuum  cleaners, toasters, refrigerators, and cars pointed to a collision be- tween the masculine world of technology and production and the  feminine world of the home.36 Warhol further blurred the distinc- tion between art and advertisement: his famous thirty-two painted  Campbell’s Soup Cans (1961–62) meticulously reproduced a de- sign that was itself a corporate creation, without specifi c author- ship, and readily recognizable as a commercial product. The soup  cans immediately evoke the domestic world of women; but it is a  more starkly modern world where soup is prefabricated and con- densed rather than homemade, and where products and people be- come interchangeable. The emblematic appropriation of consumer goods—especially  clothing and music—became a characteristic of various 1960s Brit- ish youth subcultures, beginning with the Teddy boys and continu- ing with rival gangs of rockers and mods. Thus the rockers’ decid- edly nostalgic greased-back hair, leather jackets, motorcycles, and  taste for early American rockabilly contrasted with the mods’ de- cidedly modern slim Italian suits, Vespa motor scooters, and taste  for jazz and African American rhythm and blues. In this way Brit- ish youth subcultures shared an expressive strategy with Pop Art- ists. (Indeed, by 1966, The Who’s wardrobe—badges, T-shirts with  targets, Union Jack suit coats—visually resembled images found in  several Peter Blake pieces.) Bowie and other glam rock artists at  the turn of the decade similarly relied on prefabricated musical im- ages drawn from past styles such as early rock and roll, doo-wop,  boogie-woogie, piano ballads, folk rock, cabaret, and British music  hall. Distorted guitar riffs from late-1960s acid rock and emerg- ing heavy metal found their way into glam too, in both sound and  image.37 Bowie references Jimi Hendrix in his song and character  “Ziggy Stardust”—a guitar hero described in epic and tragic terms,  who “played it left hand” (like Hendrix) and “took it all too far.”  But the musical vocabulary of blues-based rock and heavy metal  was often transformed into stylized gestures, as in the peculiarly  square opening of “Ziggy Stardust” (see ex. 1). </page> <page sequence="13"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 163       Much like the glamorous protagonist Ziggy Stardust, his famous  riff, though awash in distortion, seems foppish and confected.  Typical bluesy pitch-bending and syncopation has been replaced in  march-like time by a Baroque trill and arpeggio fi guration.       Example 1. Opening riff from “Ziggy Stardust.” Given its eclectic musical profi le, glam rock is most obviously  unifi ed by its ostentatious visual style, drawing upon the fashion  consciousness of the prior Teddy boys and the mods. As Simon  Frith observed in 1973, “Bowie constructs his music around an  image rather than a sound or a style, and it’s this that disturbs  rock purists.”38 The New Yorker rock critic Ellen Willis wrote in  1972 that “[w]hat Bowie offers is not ‘decadence’ (sorry, Middle  America) but a highly professional pop surface with a soft core:  under that multi-colored frogman’s outfi t lurks the soul of a folkie  who digs Brel.”39 Many early scholars of the British cultural stud- ies school also dismissed glam’s gender-bending antics as vacuous  showmanship and purely capitalistic in its motivation, effectively  castrating historically male subcultures. Sociologists Ian Taylor  and David Wall write: “David Bowie has been very strategically  marketed as a new kind of media product—a bisexual short-haired  mod . . . in the process [he] has left the content [of underground  music] imperceptible, emasculated and effectively irrelevant.” They  go on to argue that with glam, the music and fashion industry in- tended to create unisexual styles, marketing these to the girlfriends  of their principal subjects of study: subcultural male youths.40 Like  the feminine evocations of mass-produced Campbell’s Soup, Bow- ie’s bisexuality appeared to be organically related to the effeminiz- ing effects of commodifi cation. By this logic, all sellouts are queer  and all consumers are poseurs. Warhol posed as a poseur, as both avid consumer and mechani- </page> <page sequence="14"> 164 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   cal producer of mass culture; he famously claimed that “[t]he rea- son I’m painting this way is that I want to be a machine”—a retort  to Pollock’s statement “I am nature.”41 He also aspired to be vacu- ous and superfi cial, the way he understood Hollywood stars to be  (P, 40). Of course, Warhol was no more superfi cial than Bowie was  gay. Warhol once quipped, “if you want to know all about Andy  Warhol, just look at the surface: of my paintings and fi lms and me,  and there I am. There’s nothing behind it.”42 Warhol did not actual- ly claim to be a blank canvas; rather, he claimed to be a canvas that  he himself had painted. For Warhol, surface became content; mass- produced images held the key to his—or anyone’s—personhood. Surface and depth—these are terms that imply three dimensions,  a volume readily perceptible and in relation to the viewer. Rosalind  Krauss has pointed out the paradox of surface in modernist art:  “the work’s surface,” she notes, “[was] thought of as existing in  relation to its ‘depth’ much the way that the exterior of the human  subject is understood to relate to his internal, or true self.”43 But it  is telling that Krauss moves from painting to human subjectivity,  for what is at stake in this artistic expression of surface is access to  the deepest recesses of the self.44 For Sigmund Freud, the surface of symptoms—physical tics, ver- bal slips, aberrant behavior, dreams—betrays the pressures of the  unconscious. The unconscious is not a subconscious—a deeper en- crypted knowledge—as is popularly misconstrued (and was even in  Freud’s day); rather it is a repository of ideas that cannot be known  in their authentic form; hence he calls it das Unbewußte.45 But if the  unconscious is not itself deep, then the source of its content is: the  sexual drive, the drive for physical gratifi cation, which Freud de- scribes as an “excitation from within . . . originating in the interior  of the body and transmitted to the mental apparatus.”46 The truth  of our sexual desire, the original maternal object of our libido, is  necessarily repressed and lodged in the unconscious; erotic energy  is sublimated—displaced, transformed—into suitable social expres- sions (including art and music) only after it has been routed over  the topography of the mental apparatus through the territories of  the id and the ego.47 The ego functions “to bring the infl uence of  the external world to bear upon the id and its tendencies . . . to sub- </page> <page sequence="15"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 165 stitute the reality principle for the pleasure principle which reigns  unrestrictedly in the id.” Freud compares the ego to a rider “who  must hold in check the superior strength of the horse.” He goes on  to make another curious point, that “often a rider, if he is not to be  parted from his horse, is obliged to guide it where it wants to go; so  in the same way the ego is in the habit of transforming the id’s will  into action as if it were its own” (TEI, 15). Thus the id comes to the  surface, and the control of the ego is only a pose.       A young woman sits astride a horse. The repetition and disposition  of the single image mimics the rhythm of the gallop, marking a  strong descending diagonal path across a fl at, blank fi eld. Chang- ing densities of ink produce a visual parallel to the varied sounds of  the horse’s feet as they spring from or fall to the ground.       Fig. 4. Andy Warhol,  National Velvet, 1963.

Taylor’s youthful potential, verve, and athleticism  are frozen, rendered timeless, and yet in counterpoint to the real- time careening path of her life and career. In 1961, while working  on the movie Cleopatra, Taylor had begun a public and scandal- ous affair with actor Richard Burton. The affair ruined both their  marriages and caused Taylor to attempt suicide. While on set in  Rome, a Vatican newspaper denounced her as an “erotic vagrant”  (she had already broken up a marriage between Eddie Fischer and  Debbie Reynolds). By 1963, with the much anticipated and disap- pointing release of Cleopatra, Taylor’s image was saturated with il- licit and commodifi ed sexuality. Warhol’s silkscreen retrieves from  the past a prepubescent, still licit, sexuality, revivifi ed on the can- vas with serialized images that appear to move (perhaps referring  to the famous early sequential horse photographs of Eadweard J.  Muybridge). The painting seems joyous, energetic, free—a nostal- gic return to a moment before the fall. Yet we know that Liz’s  horse is taking the lead here; her ego will be acquiescent to the  turns and jumps of her id. We can glimpse the future-perfect of this  young Liz—what will have happened to her and her image—in the  depleted ink of the bottom frames. There she is not disappearing  into the distance: she is fading into the surface. Cover songs are by defi nition a musical resurfacing; sometimes,  paradoxically, a new musical surface brings to the fore a seemingly  latent expressive aspect of the original (Hendrix’s rock cover of  Dylan’s folk ballad, for example), as if desublimating a repressed  genre or style. The originals that serve as Bowie’s foundation for  Pin Ups form an odd assortment of songs from classic mod an- thems to early psychedelia and pure radio pop. In contrast to his  tribute songs on Hunky Dory, which celebrate his American infl u- ences (Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol, Lou Reed), Pin Ups pays tribute  to the British groups popular in the same era as Dylan, Warhol,  and Reed (from 1964 to 1967, as the back cover states), and play- ing in London clubs and on the radio when Bowie (born 1947) was  a teenager: </page> <page sequence="17"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 167 track list for PIN UPS with original  artists and release dates   1. “Rosalyn” (The Pretty Things, 1964)   2. “Here Comes the Night” (Them, 1965)   3. “I Wish You Would” (The Yardbirds, 1964)   4. “See Emily Play” (Pink Floyd, 1967)   5. “Everything’s Alright” (The Mojos, 1964)   6. “I Can’t Explain” (The Who, 1965)   7. “Friday on My Mind” (The Easybeats, 1966)   8. “Sorrow” (The Merseys, 1966)   9. “Don’t Bring Me Down” (The Pretty Things, 1964) 10. “Shapes of Things” (The Yardbirds, 1966) 11. “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” (The Who, 1965) 12. “Where Have All the Good Times Gone” (The Kinks, 1965) We might well compare Bowie’s covers to Warhol’s paintings of  Campbell’s Soup cans or Elizabeth Taylor movie stills—nostalgic  images of media products that condense the sentiments of an era.  From the vantage point of 1973, the years between 1964 and 1967  may have seemed quaint—a time just prior to the countercultur- al era of protests and psychedelia, and prior to a new monumen- talism in rock characterized by the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely  Hearts Club Band, The Who’s rock opera Tommy, and Jimi Hen- drix’s Electric Ladyland. By 1973, sex had come to the surface  through a quasi-clinical discourse of best-selling self-help books:  Everything You Wanted to Know about Sex (1969), The Sensuous  Woman (1969), and The Joy of Sex (1973). At the same time that  sex became a product, it also became a politics. Key pop-feminist  texts such as The Female Eunuch (1970) by British scholar and  media fi gure Germaine Greer were driving a wedge between the  genders; among other things, Greer attacked products of consumer  society for fostering stereotypes that effectively castrated women.48  Gay liberation movements in the United States and Britain began  their own fi ght for equality after the Stonewall riots in New York  in 1969. In an interview from 1976, Bowie claims that the iden- tity politics of America forced him into publicizing his bisexual- ity: “I never, ever said the word gay when I fi rst got over here to  America. . . . Nobody understood the European way of dressing  </page> <page sequence="18"> 168 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   and adopting the asexual, androgynous everyman pose” (“DB,”  278). Bowie seems to be referring to the distinctly European fi g- ure of the aesthete—the French fl âneur obsessed with observing,  and the British dandy, obsessed with being observed. The Teddy  boys and the mods, with their attention to style and music, are  the latter-day, “everyman” version of these late-nineteenth-century  aesthetes, which have no clear American equivalent—with the ex- ception, perhaps, of Andy Warhol.49       The song portrays ambivalence. Vocals switch between blues wail- ing and light pop crooning; tight country-and-western-style verses,  with a two-beat bass and square four-bar phrases, are juxtaposed  with an expansive chorus, replete with dramatic drum fi lls and  block organ chords, signaled by an emotional vocal lead-in: “Oh,  Here it comes! Here comes the night.”       Bowie’s Pin Ups is an unabashed celebration of the pre-feminist,  pre-hippie, pre-gay British male perspectives—rebellious, serious,  sentimental, and even abject. Let us consider “Here Comes the  Night” by Them. Originally released in 1965 and reaching number  two on the UK charts, the song features Van Morrison on vocals  and a split-personality style that functions as a musical and emo- tional hook. The country-and-western verses are ambivalent and  even self-deprecating, as the lyric subject observes his ex-girlfriend  with another man. Oddly enough, our protagonist seems to have  an aesthetic response to what he sees: “It’s funny how they look so  good together,” he muses, then asks, “Wonder what is wrong with  me?” which could mean “What is wrong with me that she has cho- sen another man?” or “What is wrong with me that I am appreci- ating how good another man looks with the object of my desire?”  The memory of the pleasure of being watched (recall the dandy,  and the mods) merges here with the pleasure and pain of watch- ing (the fl âneur). Although Baudelaire’s fl âneur reveled in the night  (“Mais le soir est venu”), the “night” of “Here Comes the Night”  is clearly metaphorical—the dark night of the subject’s soul, his ab- ject self-refl ection in the face and stance of a rival.50 We hear both  </page> <page sequence="19"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 169 pain and resignation in the blues wail of the chorus—an internal  cry in the high-register backing vocals and an external resignation  in the lower-register lead vocal. If the original song tended toward the histrionic, then Bowie’s  version might be described as a full-out tantrum. Where the origi- nal begins with a simple snare drum opening, Bowie begins with a  thunderous electric guitar glissando, followed by a transformation  of Van Morrison’s opening bluesy wail “oooh here it comes” into  an ululating banshee shriek. Here it comes indeed! In the choruses  throughout the song, Bowie’s voice cries out above the lower-reg- ister backing vocals, all signs of resignation gone. The verses have  lost some of their country-and-western fl avor, softened by a promi- nent bass line that slides around beneath Bowie’s exaggerated vo- cals, full of gasps and shakes, his wide vibrato and warped vowels  sounding full of pathos, like Judy Garland past her prime. Whereas  the original version of the song presented a topography of spiking  peaks within a controlled emotional fl atland, Bowie’s cover paves  over the psychological terrain of the original in favor of a singular  emotion, or at least the outward effects of a singular emotion—the  pain of abandonment, with none of the internal grappling. You  could say that Bowie brought out the surface of this song, rather  than some presumably hidden depth. Here, as in all the covers, Bowie slowed the tempo from the origi- nal, and the production and mixing has changed considerably as  well: the boosted bass, loud, distorted guitars, and bright, forward  percussion accorded with the hard rock styles of the early 1970s and  had become a “glam rock sound” by 1973.51 There is a heaviness  about the music, and Bowie and co-producer Ken Scott applied this  new musical heaviness with a particularly heavy hand in the cover  of “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,” the second single by The Who.       From the bold prefatory guitar strums the song launches into a  tuneful pop chorus alternating lead and backing vocals, the con- ventional music presenting a curious contrast to the free-spirit lyr- ics, as the singer proclaims his capacity to be and move however  and wherever he desires.       </page> <page sequence="20"> 170 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” captures in sound the stance of  youthful defi ance, rebellion, and self-authorization of their Lon- don mod audience, who were largely working class and Irish (EI,  81–84). The anarchic lyrical theme is given a musical analogue in  the raspy proclamations of the verse (“Nothing gets in my way,  not even locked doors”) and the central chaotic instrumental break  that follows. Drummer Keith Moon thrashes about with cascad- ing fi lls and cymbal crashes while guitarist Pete Townsend overlays  pulsing electronic feedback, glissandi, and power chords that have  no rhythmic relationship to the drum fi lls. The independent direc- tions of drum and guitar threaten to break the ensemble apart, but  the thread of a cycling keyboard riff holds them together. “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere” compares to the “bursting mas- culinity” of Pollock’s Abstract Expressionist paintings: the frenzied  drum solos of Moon provide an aural rendering of Pollock’s fre- netic gestural lines, while Townsend’s feedback of white noise sug- gests the boundless fl at, white canvas, and his lyrics of frustrated,  rebellious youth match Pollock’s epic struggles with modernist ex- pression. Roger Daltrey’s vocal is raw and explosive; it is not a par- ticularly heavy voice, but neither is it supple. His singing, however,  has the quality of being unmoored, slipping around pitches and  rhythms, slurring words, throwing his weight around the melo- dy—a vocal parallel to Pollock fl icking crude enamel house paint.52 For his cover of “Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,” Bowie artifi - cially lowered the pitch of his voice, slowing down his recorded  vocals to emulate, if not also parody, the masculine heft of Dal- trey. The wild erratic energy of the central drum break similar- ly becomes effortful allusion, without the counterpoint of guitar  feedback, save for a couple of token burbles at the end. Only the  surface effect of the drum solo remains—a curious formal inter- lude between statements of the chorus. The free spirit of the origi- nal has been transformed into an odd slog through familiar musi- cal gestures, dragged down by the current fashion for thick guitar  sounds and, it seems, the history and legacy of the sonic images  themselves. Bowie’s sluggish rendering of “Anyway, Anyhow, Any- where” undoes the original expression: it takes the piss out of the  song and gives us only an empty container. </page> <page sequence="21"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 171       A lone soup can posed with a torn label that reveals the drab, mot- tled tin beneath.

There is a curious pathos and intimacy to  this painting: we see the soup can in a state of partial undress. Upon  looking closer, we can see that the complexion of the can has a li- quidity about it, composed of coalesced droplets and watery brush  strokes. The surface of Pop Art peels away to reveal an Abstract  Expressionist painting beneath. Although the label is torn down the  middle, Warhol has taken pains here to ensure that the words are  readable. The word “Camp” dominates the picture as if advertising  the gay sensibility at work, attracting our eye with its diagonal line  in contrast to the vertical seam of the can.53 The rigid yet watery  tin can seems a parodic monument to the art establishment, if not  also to a kind of industrial masculinity, while the ripped and dishev- eled label—falling apart like Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Mari- lyn Monroe, and other female gay icons of the 1960s—nonetheless  contains all the colors, all the vibrancy. It is the surface label, not  the can beneath, that gives this painting its humanity. If The Who and Jackson Pollock represent the wild, unkempt  energy of bursting masculinity, then David Bowie and Andy War- hol represent the consumers of this masculinity. Warhol’s prefab- ricated image (of prefabricated soup) compares to Bowie’s sonic  “pin up” of The Who’s radio song; expression at its base resides  in buying power and the repositioning of reproducible emblems.  The torn-away soup label that reveals yet another surface—one  that nods toward genuine expression—has a parallel in Bowie’s  imperfect manufacture of Daltrey’s voice, behind which you can  still hear Bowie’s own. But like the vivid colors and bold lines of Warhol’s paintings,  Bowie’s covers have an undeniable sensual appeal: slow, even pon- derous tempos, thick guitar lines, vocal mannerisms, emphatic  diphthongs, crisp and loud studio production. These cover songs  are rich with details, though not at all subtle. They refuse any  deeper meanings to the songs, rendering their emotional and cul- tural value as Day-Glo entertainment. Such is clearly evident in  Bowie’s cover of the Yardbirds’ “Shapes of Things.” The original  was a groundbreaking example of early psychedelic rock, with lyr- </page> <page sequence="23"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 173 ics that contemplate war, the environment, the march of time, and  human responsibility, matched by an exotic bolero rhythm, echo- ing vocals, and a fuzzbox- and feedback-heavy guitar solo by Jeff  Beck. In Bowie’s hands the song becomes vaudeville camp, with  Bowie’s theatrical vocal delivery and cockney accent incongruous- ly accompanied by otherworldly synthesized strings, a dissonant  squawking sax, and cheesy phase effects. Bowie’s version wallows  in self-absorbed sonic excess, creating a parody of the countercul- ture’s own self-absorption beneath the surface of its earnestness. Warhol’s art has been described as “desubliminatory” in that it  exposed the repressed truth that all art was, deep down, just com- modity, and in kinship with any mass-produced image bought and  sold.54 At the close of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust era of crafted androg- yny and bisexuality, Pin Ups similarly exposed the queer kinship  between artist and consumer, media star and poseur, desublimating  the commodifi ed sexuality at the core of rock-and-roll rebellion.55  This unbridled id periodically takes the lead in pop culture, as evi- dent in successive generations of rock artists since Bowie who have  capitalized on ever more blatant and queer poses of sexuality and  gender, from Madonna and Boy George in the 1980s to Lady Gaga  and Adam Lambert in the 2010s.56 Although by defi nition derivative and superfi cial, posing has its  own complexities. Posing calls attention to the temporal and mate- rial relationship between original and copy, and to the apprehen- sion of surface in contrast to the perception of depth. The poseur’s  superfi ciality represents an intense focus on immediate conditions,  but as conditioned by key fi gures of the past. Oedipal struggles  and anxieties of infl uence do not seem relevant here. Neither War- hol nor Bowie claimed originality. Warhol’s use of commercial art  begs the question of originality, but he also openly admired Jas- per Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, and admitted to gathering  ideas from his friends and agents, especially Ivan Karp and Henry  Geldzahler (P, 16–17, 23). As mentioned, Bowie frequently cited  or sang about his infl uences: the Velvet Underground, Bob Dylan,  Mick Jagger (whom Bowie refers to more than once as a “moth- er fi gure”),57 presumably every artist on Pin Ups, and, of course,  Andy Warhol. This citation of sources, of people, by these infa- mous poseurs, tells another story about the contingency of iden- </page> <page sequence="24"> 174 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   tity—one that contrasts somewhat with Judith Butler’s model in  which faceless ideologies of gender script the performance. Posing  does not deny the thorough mediation of ideology; rather, it avoids  getting hung up on it, by clinging to the surfaces, or rather, the hu- man faces that enable the possibilities for resistance. I am arguing, then, that posing has, ironically, a temporal and  relational depth. But as an articulation of sexuality, posing is reso- lutely superfi cial. This is not as bad as it sounds. Freud may have  argued that a deep psychological process underlies this superfi cial  act, but sex happens on the surface, after all—skin touching skin.       Without apparent human intervention, an otherwise unadulterated  soup can has been penetrated by a can opener with the added fea- ture of a jackknife corkscrew—a superfl uous erection as well as a  visual pun.

Sex, screw- ing, is reduced to—and parodied as—a pornographic pose of ob- jects; more explicitly, as the penetration of one object by another.  Penetration might be used to argue for physical and conceptual  depth in sex; indeed, within compulsory heterosexuality, penetra- tion is the only sex act that counts. But with these pictures Warhol  suggests that an orifi ce need not be considered a portal to the in- ner self; it could be simply an access to another surface.58 Screwing  thus loses its premiere status as sex, as a particularly meaningful,  or even a human, act.       Won’t you tell me, where have all the good times gone?       Pin Ups closes with a song that already in 1965 mocked senti- mental themes of lost innocence with the revelation of new sexual  appetites (“Daddy didn’t have no toys, and mummy didn’t need no  boys”). By 1973 the Kinks’ harsh garage-rock sound, ironic nostal- gia, and sexual shock had become like can openers: banal tools for  Bowie’s glam rock trade. A needle skims the grooved surface of a vinyl record, translating  that topography into sound, into the radio hit sung by a rock star  pinup. Vinyl, canvas, skin—these have their own sexual terrains  and attractions. With their insistence on surfaces, Bowie and War- hol refused to engage with the deeper meanings and cultural freight  of sexuality; they refused penetration altogether. Instead, they of- fered—on canvas, on vinyl, and in the media—a sexuality of the  surface whereby sex was not psychology, not a way of life, not a  politics, but an art of posing. </page> <page sequence="26"> 176 qui parle   fall/winter 2012   vol.21, no.1   Notes This article is dedicated to Kate Morris, who inspired me to bring the  methodologies and vocabulary of art history and criticism to bear on  music, and who read many versions of the essay and offered invalu- able commentary. 1.  These are The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from  Mars (RCA, released June 6, 1972); Aladdin Sane (RCA, released  April 13, 1973); and Pin Ups (released October 19, 1973).

Ken Scott  produced all three albums as well as the earlier album Hunky Dory  (RCA, released December 17, 1971).

The detail of the reclining classical fi gure in the gold medallion is  notably absent, lending more weight to a reading of the cans as them- selves anthropomorphic. Such a reading is in keeping with the ideas  of art critics of the 1960s who saw a “surrogate person” in the cubes  and steel beams of minimalist sculpture, and even a single mark on a  canvas.

Bowie had already written the song “Andy Warhol,” which was to  appear on Hunky Dory, before meeting some of Warhol’s entourage  in August 1971 during a London run of the play Pork, a dramatiza- tion of Warhol’s conversations with various members of the Factory  clique. Two members of the cast, Tony Zanetta and Cherry Vanilla,  joined Bowie’s retinue in 1973. In September 1971, Bowie traveled to  New York for business purposes, meeting at this time Lou Reed, War- hol, and Iggy Pop.

An early articulation of Butler’s theory appears in Theater Journal,  along with articles on such canonical dramatists as Samuel Beckett,  Harold Pinter, and Sam Shepard. There Butler identifi ed “associative  semantic meanings” that link phenomenology’s theory of “acts” as  the realization of historical and cultural possibilities “through lan- guage, gesture, and all manner of symbolic social sign” to theories of  performance and acting that understand “acts” as the public embodi- ment of a preexisting script—in this case, gender norms. See Judith  Butler, “Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phe- nomenology and Feminist Theory,” Theater Journal 49, no. 4 (1988):  519–31. In the later “Imitation and Gender Subordination,” Butler  switched to language that shares “associative semantic meanings”  with the discourse of commodifi cation (and cover songs, as I sug- gested above)—namely, that of “original and copy.” Our mundane  performances of gender are compelled by the fi ction of an original  version, which we attempt to imitate to various degrees. 15.

Bowie was  also infl uenced by the androgyny of Malcolm McDowell in A Clock- work Orange, which opened in London in early 1972; see Marc Spitz,  Bowie: A Biography (New York: Crown Publishers, 2009), 178–79,  hereafter cited as BB. Another predecessor to Bowie’s Ziggy, how- ever, is the androgynous, bisexual rock star in the fi lm Performance  (directed by Nicholas Roeg, released 1970), who was played by Mick  Jagger. 26.

David Buckley tries diligently to  authenticate Bowie’s sexual outlaw identity; he declares that “Bowie  was, to a degree, bisexual,” despite the skepticism of Bowie’s produc- er Ken Scott, who saw the bisexuality claim as a publicity stunt (see  SF, 111–12). Spitz is far more skeptical: “unlike actual gay stars, the  fair-weather bisexual Bowie would distance himself from this when  the mood hit him” (BB, 182; see also 180–86). Edwards and Zanetta  claim Bowie’s forays into homosexuality had more to do with image  research than actual sexuality (see S, 111). 31.  Ryan Moore, “Alternative to What?

Since  Pollock died in 1956, Townsend’s claim that he saw the artist lec- </page> <page sequence="31"> Peraino: Bowie, Warhol, and the Art of Posing 181 ture at the school is spurious. Townsend also linked their wild and  violent stage act to the avant-garde auto-destructive art of Gustav  Metzger, although many critics believe this was a later justifi cation.  Metzger was a guest lecturer at Ealing in 1966, more than a year after  Townsend began smashing his guitar onstage.

The album cover shows a glowing shadowy  image of Bolan with guitar and a tower of amplifi ers. His trademark  fuzz-toned boogie guitar riffs became the model for later pop glam  rock groups such as Slade and Sweet, and the lone glam woman Suzi  Quatro. In 1972 Bolan had a hit song titled “Metal Guru.” See Bar- ney Hoskyns, Glam! Bowie, Bolan and the Glitter Rock Revolution  (New York: Pocket Books, 1998), 40–48. 38.

This metaphor of depth to describe subjective interiority emerged  with nineteenth-century German Romantics, many of whom also  proclaimed a homology between music and stratifi ed subjectivity. The  writer and critic E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776–1822) was a key fi gure in  this regard. As Holly Watkins explains, “depth, for Hoffmann, per- forms a dual function: it preserves the impenetrable mystery of the  genius’s creative powers, and it claims for the work a rational con- struction belied by its disjunct surface.” See Holly Watkins, “From  the Mine to the Shrine: The Critical Origins of Musical Depth,”  19th-Century Music 27, no. 3 (2004): 201. The writings of Theodor  Adorno offer a modernist iteration of the surface-depth model of  music and subjectivity. See especially his essay “Music in the Back- ground” (ca. 1934), where he decries a phenomenon akin to cover  songs—the arrangements and digests of art music into café music:  “Through them shimmers the mysterious allegorical appearance that  arises whenever fragments of the past come together in an uncertain  surface.” Reprinted in Essays on Music, ed.

Sigmund Freud, “The Unconscious” (1915), in The Standard Edition  of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, ed. James  Strachey (London: The Hogarth Press, 1957), 14:161–215. Freud  rejects the term “subconscious” as incorrect and misleading (170),  though Strachey points out that he had used the term in some of his  early writings. 46.  Sigmund Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle, trans. James Strachey  (New York: Norton, 1961), 40. Strachey translates Triebe (drives) as  “instincts” in all cases. 47.  Freud discusses a topographical model of the mental apparatus in  many of his writings. In The Ego and the Id he elaborates a dynamic  process that seems to be in tandem with the topographical model; his  language in this work is especially shot through with the opposition  of “internal” and “external” stimuli, and “surface” and “depth” re- lations of ego and id.

At the 2009 American Music Awards, Lambert took Bowie’s pose of  fellatio one step further by getting rid of the intervening guitar. We  can also see periodic anti-glam backlashes in the decidedly desexual- ized styles of punk in the late 1970s and grunge in the 1990s. Though  these musical styles were aggressive and guitar-oriented, which usu- ally reads as masculinist, punk and grunge were ironically more in- clusive of women artists than 1970s glam.
