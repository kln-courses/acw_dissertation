<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEER, Vol. 59, No. ,,January I98I From Ermpirocriticism to Empiriomonism: The Marxist Phenomenology of Aleksandr Bogdanov MICHAEL M. BOLL RUSSIAN Marxism was less than a decade old when it first revealed a disquieting tendency to contribute its own creativity to the legacy of the German master. In the I89os Peter Struve, the author of the Social Democrats' party programme, initiated the Russian flirtation with the revisionism of Eduard Bernstein. By I902, Struve and his prolific followers (the later Vekhi group) bade farewell to the radical- ism of their youth in exchange for a more amorphous social philo- sophy combining Kant's ethical teachings and English Liberalism.' Yet their absence was hardly marked before a second group of 'critical' Marxists emerged within the Russian party. This group spurned the ideals of Kant for the anti-metaphysical empiricism of the contemporary German scientist, Ernst Mach. Perhaps with the aid of Mach's novel world view, Marxism might be brought into harmony with the advancements in science and philosophy of the past two decades. Ernst Mach himself was neither an opponent nor a proponent of any school of political philosophy, but rather an untiring and erudite foe of metaphysics in all avenues of human thought. A professor of physics at the Charles University of Prague, and later professor of the History and Theory of Inductive Sciences at Vienna, Mach eschewed the very notion that his thoughts formed a coherent philosophical system. Yet his rules of thought and his reflections on the nature of the world - comments and discussions which intro- duced his major works on physics and optics - did give a particular, if unsystematic, world view. In conjunction with the writings of several contemporaries, such as the German philosopher Richard Avenarius, this world view was soon dubbed Critical Empiricism. M. M. Boll is a Professor in the Department of History, San Jose State University. 1 For a fuller discussion see Michael M. Boll, 'Problemy idealizma and the Social Philosophy of Twentieth-Century Russian Liberalism' (The Indian Political Science Review, Delhi, January 1974).</page><page sequence="2">42 MICHAEL M. BOLL Its major premises can be taken from one of Mach's more famous works: The Analysis of Sensations. For Mach, the 'real world' could only be sought in direct and immediate experience. All experience, in turn, consisted of elements, neutral in character, and divided into physical and mental categories due to the connections displayed among elements, not due to the elements themselves. Mach maintained the existence of three kinds of connections (complexes) which he called 'bodies', 'our body', and 'the complexes composed of volitions, memories, images, and the rest... .'2 The elements of these complexes were termed ABC (for bodies), KLM (for my body) and a, fi, y for volitions, etc. With this scheme, Mach argued that the sole distinction between these com- plexes lay in the nature and unity of the connections found in each. Thus, ABC, in total, formed a logical construct, body, the com- ponents (elements) of which were investigated by natural science. KLM, in turn, formed the abstract notion of my body, a field of investigation for physiology. The elements themselves, however, whether they occurred in ABC, or KLM, were identical and neutral. Thus, if I wish to investigate the greenness of a tree in conjunction with the function of chlorophyll in the presence of sunlight, I am investigating A in conjunction and connection with BC, and am in the realm of natural science. If, in turn, I investigate green in conjunction and connection with damage to the rods and cones of my eye (colour-blindness), I am considering K with LM. If I investigate my blushing in connection with a certain emotion, I am correlating a change in KLM with a change in a, fi, y. The blushing may be investigated as the appearance of a certain redness of my face, which I might correlate with a rise in body temperature in the realm of KLM alone (physiology), or the redness might be probed with respect to the reflective properties of the mirror I hold, that is in the realm of ABC. While Mach avoided the concept 'cause' whenever possible, he maintained that changes in ABC and KLM (and also, though less discussed by Mach, in a, fl, y) are co-determining. Thus the movement of a cube away from me is accompanied by a change of retinal irritation: a situation identical with my movement away from a cube. In both cases, the cube becomes smaller. For Mach, the cube actually does change in size since there is no cube 'in itself' independent of the logical construct composed of cube elements. The properties of one and the same body therefore appear modified by our own body; they appear conditioned by it. But where now is 2 Ernst Mach, The Analysis of Sensations, trans. by C. M. Williams, New York, 1959, pp. 8-9.</page><page sequence="3">MARXIST PHENOMENOLOGY OF BOGDANOV 43 that same body which appears so different? All that can be said is that with different KLM different ABC ... are associated.3 In his approach, Mach showed himself to be a thorough pheno- menalist. There are no 'things-in-themselves' which, while remain- ing unchanged and unchangeable, somehow give rise to sensation. Equally, there is no subject, abstract or concrete, which enters into the knowing process. There are only neutral elements, functionally united in three relatively distinct constellations: bodies, my body, and certain volitions, will, etc. The element green may be investi- gated in either of the first two constellations with the former being a functional problem of natural science, and the latter falling into the domain of physiology. This cursory glance at Mach's position, however, raised several questions. First, the constellation a, /1, y appears somehow different from ABC and KLM. Clearly green does not make its appearance here. Aware of this problem, Mach apparently believed that volitions, will, etc., would eventually be reduced to connections of KLM and thus lose their apparent independence as a distinct constellation of connections. Mach made a partial attempt at such a reduction in his later work Knowledge and Error. Perhaps more important, however, is that Mach's approach seems to lead him towards solipsism. Mach's answer to the charge of solipsism is, at best, partial. We know the Other is like myself through analogy since we perceive his KLM as analogous to our own.4 A different, perhaps more satis- factory denial of solipsism is offered by Avenarius. For him, the belief in the reality of the Other is not a problem for philosophy but for medicine. Healthy people are those who believe in the Other, and to question their existence places one outside the community of one's healthy comrades. Reality is a 'texture', a 'tone' of certain cognitive experiences which points, in the last resort, not to the 'thing-in- itself' but to the relation between the cognitor and that cognated. Reality is such a tone generally affixed to knowledge of the Other, and its absence is a problem of mental health. Avenarius offered a second denial of solipsism by noting that the presence of the Other 3 Ibid., pp. 9-io. 4 Ibid., p. i8. It must be understood that the question of the Other's consciousness is not here at issue. Consciousness is not something separate from the neutral elements nor is it a particular element or relation of elements found in living beings. For Mach there is no I, no Other as a repository of consciousness. The Ego, like the thing-in-itself, is merely a metaphysical construct, a short-hand expression for a given constellation of more or less fixed elements. What is at issue is the opaqueness of the elements a, ,B, y in their relation to the Other as KLM. The Other says he is angry and his face flushes. By analogy (Mach does not pursue the more fruitful approach of 'playing the language game correctly') with my own relation of a, fi, y and a particular K of my KLM (face flushed), I assume he too possesses the a, f, y constellation.</page><page sequence="4">44 MICHAEL M. BOLL formed an intrinsic part of the primeval experience of man. Indeed the notion of reality as common to all arises from the expressions of the Other towards the objective world. The Other cries 'the sun rises', and I turning my head, perceive the sun above the horizon. Thus, the reality of the Other precedes and forms the ground for my perception of the objective. To question the reality of the Other is to question reality itself.5 The writings of Mach, and to a lesser extent, Avenarius struck a responsive cord among Russian Marxists in their struggle to keep abreast of current scientific thinking. A general movement of Russian Empiriocriticism appeared in the early years of this century and included individuals such as Vladimir Bazarov, Pavel Yush- kevich, N. Valentinov, I. A. Berman and Aleksandr Bogdanov. While each attempted to develop further the ideas contained in the original German writings, it was Bogdanov who accepted the challenge of harmonizing Marxism and 'Machism' in pursuit of an orthodox socialist theory consistent with the discoveries and changes of the current era. Aleksandr Bogdanov (a pseudonym) was born Aleksandr Mali- novsky in I873. He was educated as a physician at the University of Khar'kov, but spurned the practice of medicine for the more exciting life of politics. In I898, one year prior to graduation from medical school, Bogdanov joined the fledgling Russian Social Democratic party. While not present at the decisive 1903 party congress which witnessed the split into Bolshevik and Menshevik factions, Bogdanov quickly pledged his allegiance to Lenin's section, and for the next few years strove to organize a journal which might spread the Bolshevik philosophy. In 1905 Bogdanov was rewarded for his efforts, being elected a member of the Bolshevik Central Committee and taking his place on the editorial board of the party journal. Not until I908 did Lenin and Bogdanov finally part ways as the result of Bogdanov's philosophical views, a dispute over party 5 R. Avenarius, Kritik der reinen Erfahrung, Leipzig, I888-I890, vol. 2. See also Wendell T. Bush, 'Avenarius and the Standpoint of Pure Experience' (Archives of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods, no. 2, New York, November 1905, pp. 1-79). For Bogdanov's views of Avenarius see A. Bogdanov, Filosofiya zhivogo opyta, St Petersburg, 1913, pp. I62-64. The more restricted appeal of Avenarius was partly due to the extreme difficulty of understanding his writings. Mach, a fellow German, when referring to his own limited knowledge of Avenarius, commented: 'It is asking rather much of an elderly man that to the labour of learning the languages of the nations, he should add that of learning the languages of an individual' (Mach, Analysis of Sensations, p. 48). Friedrich Ueberwegs notes: 'Seine Kenntnisnahme ist dadurch erschwert, dass A [Avanarius] sich eine besondere philosophische Terminologie geschaffen hat' (Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie, vol. 4, Dresden, 1882, p. 346).</page><page sequence="5">MARXIST PHENOMENOLOGY OF BOGDANOV 45 tactics towards the third Russian Duma, and Lenin's opposition to a party school on the island of Capri. Thus in the very period when Bogdanov developed his own Marxist approach to philosophy under the name of Empiriomonism, he was an active and accepted member of the Bolshevik faction.6 To Bogdanov, the school of Empiriocriticism was not a rejection of materialism but rather its revival. Materialism, he maintained, had lost its original meaning, the concept of matter having shed its sensuous nature and having turned into a vague abstraction. Empiriocriticism, having rejected the word, restored its sense which is namely this: the physical complexes, how they are given in experience. Thus we have strong reasons for considering Empiriocriticism as a continuation of materialism.7 Yet Bogdanov refused to accept Empiriocriticism in its present form. For him, the writings of Mach and Avenarius reflected the bourgeois nature of European society. Empiriocriticism, he argued, was oriented towards contemplation not action, towards a pure descrip- tion of the world as it is, not towards changing it. This was natural, he reasoned, given the stage of capitalist development. Mach and even Avenarius were products of the scientific institutes characteristic of the current phase of scientific development in the West, one in which contemplation and action had been separated. Thus 'con- temporary empiricism is the highest stage yet of the contemplative philosophy of being'.8 This artificial separation had led Mach to reject explanation in favour of pure description, a rejection which precluded the Empiriocritics from developing an adequate notion of causality as the explanatory connection between various elements of experience. This self-imposed refusal to explain, Bogdanov concluded, prevented the Empiriocritics from constructing a monist system which would overcome the dualism of objective and subjec- tive complexes.9 The construction of a monist viewpoint Bogdanov reserved for himiself. Thus, with justification, he rejected the notion that he himself was an Empiriocritic: I cannot, however, acknowledge myself a 'Machist' in philosophy. In the general philosophical conceptions, I took from Mach only one - the idea concerning the neutrality of elements of experience with respect 6 For a survey of Bogdanov's life and activities see his entry in volume 6 of the 1927 edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, pp. 574-82.

BOLL to the 'physical' and the 'psychological', about the dependence of these characteristics only on the connections of experience. Thus in all that follows, in the teachings of the genesis of physical and psychological experience, in the teachings of substitutions, in the teaching concerning the 'interferences' of complexes . .. there is nothing in common between Mach and me. I am much less a 'Machist' than C. [Comrade] Beltov [a pseudonym for G. Plekhanov] is a 'Holbachian' and I hope this does not prevent either of us from being good Marxists.'0 Bogdanov believed that monistic unity might be achieved on the basis of Mach's philosophy of neutral elements in two ways. First, the common ground in terms of which the physical and mental arose could be traced and explained in a historical fashion. Second, the seemingly distinct complexes, physical and mental, could be shown as interrelated through a reformulation of their causal connections. It is this process of creating a monist interpretation of empiriocriticism which constitutes Bogdanov's original contribution to philosophical thought. Contrary to the assertions of the Enmpiriocritics, Bogdanov main- tained the 'objectivity' of the physical elements is not simply given, but rather the result of an extended and practical history of man. 'It is necessary to understand reality as practice,' taught Marx. But what is human practice? First of all, the struggle with the elementalness [so stikhjynostyu] of nature, the process of subordination to man, i.e. production. This proceeds not according to individual but according to collective strengths, and thus the practical nature of man is a social nature. In it one must seek explanations of every development of mankind, for the forms of his life and thought." Marx considered reality from the point of view of social practice in its straight-forward [pryamoy], direct form, i.e. in the form of production.'2 Bogdanov maintained that man emerged in his primitive stage with no distinction between the physical and mental. Much like a modern child in the first years of his development, primitive man's 'individual consciousness', his Ego if one wishes to use outmoded metaphysical terms, was not distinguished from the group's con- sciousness in general. All that confronted early man was an indistinct, chaotic realm which formed the media, the environment of his actions. Language emerged slowly as the group's means of dis- tinguishing various actions (not parts) towards the heretofore un- differentiated environment. Thus the most basic words arose as cries from group members, cries designating particular group 10 A. Bogdanov, Empiriomonizm, Moscow, I906, vol. 3, p. xii. 11 Filosofiya, p. i98. 12 Ibid., p. 2I9.

Peel, New York, I968.</page><page sequence="7">MARXIST PHENOMENOLOGY OF BOGDANOV 47 actions required for survival. A cry might indicate the presence of food whose capture needed group action or danger which required group flight. Man's basic distinctions related not to particular things but to the more abstract forms of resistance or accommodation to his prolonged existence. The direct, basic metaphor, that is the word-concept, served to distinguish various actions [deystviya] which occurred in nature and had vital significance for society, useful or harmful. This means that the primitive elements of experience have an entirely active, socio-primitive character.13 Only at a later stage of development did man as a social being develop concepts about things, but again in terms of his practical interaction (production) with nature. Something received a name when it became practical in the process of labour (plants, minerals, etc.) or when it was viewed as a hindrance. But since one and the same thing could have both relations to the group (a river, for example is a hindrance to cross but helpful to drink), further determinations were made concerning its 'essence'. In this entire process of historical determination, the principle of purposeful interaction, labour, remained dominant. Every element expresses one or another sum of human effort .., it is the product of these efforts and thus a 'crystal of labour'....14 The elements of experience are the products of social work embodied in knowledge; they are created on the basis of social need in the demarca- tion of diverse conditions and parts of this work which form, Marx might have said, its 'use value' [potrebitel'naya tsennost']; it is distin- guished and formulated by the path of expending social-working energy - in this lies its 'labour value'.'5 The process of distinguishing elements in physical reality is un- ending since it arises in the continuing practical interaction of man and nature. To Bogdanov there was no final or absolute set of determinations of all elements and: 'It would be the greatest naivete to ascribe to this or another division of experience a final, absolute significance."16 If the elements composing the physical realm emerged gradually in the process of production, so did the awareness of the mental. While Bogdanov pays less attention to this set of complexes, he does maintain the Marxist priority of the physical over the mental in 13 Filosofiya, p. 228. Bogdanov breaks sharply with Avenarius on this point. See ibid., p. I63. 14 Ibid., p. 229. 15 Ibid., p. 230. 16 Ibid., p. 232.</page><page sequence="8">48 MICHAEL M. BOLL historical development. Thus, the historic emergence of the I, the separation of 'individual consciousness' from the group, proceeded through the stages of physical determination and production. At a certain historic stage, the group differentiated into leader and led, with the commands of the leader forming the objective basis of the subject's realization of himself as different. The common historical basis of both constellations, the physical and the mental, lay in the ever-changing productive relationship of man to his environment. Here, however, a problem seems to arise. Given the historical explanation for the emergence of the physical and the mental, what characteristics of modern man or modern society preserve the commonness of the distinctions made? Is this awareness simply given, as the Empiriocritics believed; can it be reduced to the current forms of language, or is there another structure which common language reflects? Bogdanov's answer is that two distinct organizing principles exist, each arising from group praxis through history and expressed in the most social of all forms, language. To illustrate his point, Bogdanov suggests one take an axe and attempt to determine why it is considered part of the objective world. One might respond that the axe is physical because it interacts with other aspects of the physical world, that is it is used to cut down trees. But this is an un- satisfactory answer to Bogdanov. In his dreams a man cuts trees with great zeal, using his 'mental' axe. If you rejoin that the dreamer's axe really is not for cutting real trees, you fall into an unresolved philosophical quarrel, for the sceptics will point out that we know only our ideas or appearances. Thus your 'real' axe for cutting 'real' trees is itself only in the ideal or mental realm. You cannot avoid the dilemma by saying that the dreamer's axe disappears when he awakes. After all, the 'real' axe is also capable of disappearing. Psychology, Bogdanov continues, knows many cases of hallucinations where the 'mental' image remains no matter what changes occur in the patient: If one regards the separate 'I' as the subject of knowledge, then there is no principal hindrance to acknowledging the entire world as a complex and universally developed, systematized hallucination of such a type.'7 The sole solution is to consider neither the physical nor the mental as self-defined constellations or as subjects. Rather, both possess their own rules or system of organization. The physical axe is distin- guished from the mental precisely because it enters into the organiza- tional structure of the group. It is a suitable instrument not only for me but for everyone else. This of course, does not mean that the axe is the same for all -it is much richer in possibilities and 17 Ibid., p. 233.</page><page sequence="9">MARXIST PHENOMENOLOGY OF BOGDANOV 49 determinations for the wood-cutter than for the tailor. Yet the distinguishing mark of the physical axe is that: This experience is universally significant or objective.... The secret meaning is clear for us: the objectivity of physical being is its social system of organization.18 This naturally does not deny principles of organization to the mental elements, but merely points to distinctions between the socially-significant (physical) and subjectively organized (mental). If I think I am having an illusion, I turn to my friend and ask if he sees it also. This very question is to inquire whether a given complex of elements belongs to the socially organized system of experience. If my friend says no, this does not deny the experience; it merely indicates the proper system of organization in which it lies (the mental). This ... is experience in the individual system of organization. Such is the true significance of the 'psychological' or 'subjective'.19 One must, Bogdanov continues, distinguish in turn between the forms common within the socially-organized and individually- organized systems of experience, and the contents of these systems at a given moment. It is necessary to remember that the terms 'socially-organized' and 'individually-organized' merely designate modes of organization [sposob organizatsii] which are not identical with the concepts 'social being', 'individual being' which express what belongs to the experience of the collective or individual, but not to the modes of organization.20 Distinct from the contents of the socially-organized at any given moment, there are the forms of organization including space, time and causality. These forms, in turn, undergo evolution and change since they too result from the group's interactioii with nature, and the group's attempts to communicate in the process of organizing work. Yet while 'absolute' reality is denied both the given contents and the forms,2' this dichotomy of form and content is crucial in understanding the process of knowledge in general. Without the distinction, knowledge could not come into existence since the group would deny the objective validity of the 'new' in terms of the group content at a given time. As shown in the example of the axe and the illusion, the expression of the Other (in the latter case, the friend I consult as to whether he too sees the illusion) is central to distin- guishing the physical from the mental. Yet 'the objectivity of the 18 Ibid., p. 234. 19 Ibid., p. 235. 20 Ibid. 21 A. Bogdanov, Empiriomonizm, I, pp. 25-31. 4</page><page sequence="10">50 MICHAEL M. BOLL external object ... comes down to [svoditsya] an exchange of expres- sions in the end but it is not always based upon it immediately'.22 As an illustration of this key difference, take the discovery by Copernicus concerning the rotation of the earth about the sun. The 'objectivity' of this fact could not be predicated upon the positive assertions of the group, this notion not being part of the content of social being at the time. Its objectivity, however, was assured in that Copernicus used the astronomic date (content) of the group in conjunction with the rules of social organization in determining a new fact. Some astronomer discovers a new comet, calculating its position in space, its path, its size, [and] determines its form, structure, etc., but has yet to publish all this such that none but he has seen the comet or knows about it. Consequently it belongs, for the time being, only to his individual and not social experience. But it was found, measured, investigated by the scientific method which men collectively worked out in order to organize their experience. This means that it has already entered into the socially-organized experience, having taken its place in the ranks of objective phenomena, of the physical.23 Yet this distinction between form and content, while allowing Bogdanov to explain the progress of knowledge, raises some problems. As Bogdanov admits, there was a time when the peasantry of Russia believed in household spirits and goblins. These spirits were not only part of the content of the socially-organized (the group had no doubt as to their objective existence), but were consistent with the forms (intricate rules were understood as to how one might deal with or avoid spirits, that is principles of causality; the spirits were 'seen' in space and time, etc.). The simple question is: did these spirits exist? In his initial treatment of the problem, Bogdanov appears to waffle: ... wood goblins and household spirits can exist in the sphere of the social experience of a given people or a given group of people, for example, the peasantry; but in the experience which is socially- organized or objective, it is still not necessary to include them because they do not harmonize with the remaining collective experience and are not put together within its organizational forms, for example within the bonds of causality.24 The incomplete nature of this analysis was soon brought to Bog- danov's attention by none other than Georgiy Plekhanov, the 'father of Russian Marxism' and its leading theoretician. As Plekhanov 22 Ibid., p. 33. 23 FiIOsofiya, p. 235. 14 Empiriomonizm, i, footnote to page 41.</page><page sequence="11">MARXIST PHENOMENOLOGY OF BOGDANOV 5I pointed out, there was a lengthy period of time when there was no other 'collective experience', whenl the belief in goblins dominated the entire social thought: What follows from this? Is it possible that goblins really [svoystvenno] had an objective existence? Arguing with the aid of your 'higher criterion of objectivity', it becomes necessary to answer yes. And this alone is completely sufficient in order to see how absurd is the 'higher' construction and to reject your entire theory of objectivity....25 Bogdanov's reformulation admitted precisely what Plekhanov found absurd: For a wide circle of backward Russian peasants, spirits and goblins represent a living reality which is understood as a phenomenon of the physical world.... If there were, perhaps, no other groups besides the backward peasants, then the spirits and goblins would even now possess 'objectivity', would be socially harmoniously related to ex- perience.26 A second problem raised by Plekhanov concerned the notion of time as an evolving form of the socially-organized, devoid of founda- tion in reality itself. If time was merely a form developed by man to comprehend and organize the initially chaotic actions of his primi- tive environment, argued Plekhanov, then the primeval environment could not have existed before the emergence of the concept of time. Therefore it follows that the existence of people preceded the existence of our planet: in the beginning there were people; people began 'expressing', began socially organizing their experience; thanks to this fortunate circumstance, the physical world in general arose, and in particular our planet. This also 'developed', but only in reverse or, as it is better to say, developed wrong side out.27 Bogdanov's response to this challenge was preceded by a state- ment of his position with regard to Marx's notion of praxis as the basis of knowledge: Marx, for the first time, understood that objectivity does not possess absolute significance but rather a social-practical significance. He first indicated this in the notes on Feuerbach.... There he suggested one should understand reality, 'Wirklichkeit', the objective world as human practice and thus, as social practice.28 25 G. V. Plekhanov, Sochineniya, ed. by D. Ryazanov, Moscow, 1923, vol. 17, p. 67. 26 Filosofiya, p. 236. 27 Plekhanov, op. cit., p. 70. Plekhanov gleefully notes that it is now clear why Bog- danov has found favour among the current Russian Marxist 'God-Builders'. The essence of God, Plekhanov remarks, is that he created the world, '. . . and you, Mr Bogdanov, clearly show ... that the world was created by man, not God': ibid. 28 FilOsofiya, p- 237.</page><page sequence="12">52 MICHAEL M. BOLL It is Plekhanov himself, Bogdanov continued, who spoke in an unmarxist manner, since the truth of any position must be taken within the context of praxis: Physical experience is the experience of something, namely of all mankind in its development. This is a world of strict, constructed, worked-out, regular, determined, precise correlates; the well-organized world where all the theories of geometry, all the formulae of mechanics, physics, astronomy, etc. operate. How could one understand this world, this system of experience independent from mankind? How could one say that it existed before him?29 While this response may startle the casual reader, it is well grounded in Bogdanov's philosophy. The problem does not concern 'a world' (whatever that might mean), but this world, the world of specific determinations, of specific properties and relations. Since these properties arise from man's purposeful actions, they can have no origin or meaning independent of man himself. To talk of 'a world' independent of these specific determinations is to discuss either a 'thing-in-itself', a notion the Empiriocritics in general and Bogdanov in particular vehemently rejected, or the barest notion of substance (a world without determinations). Contrary to Plekhanov's protests, Bogdanov was not thus committed to a rejection of either evolution or modern science, to a rejection of the theory that the world existed before man or a rejection of the notion that life itself is a recent development predicated upon the higher and later organiza- tion of matter. Of course the world existed before man; such a view was entirely consistent with twentieth-century socially-organized knowledge. 'Before' and 'prior to', however, had to be understood as formal constructs which evolved through man's active pursuit of knowledge. They were not meaningful in some abstract or absolute sense, but as reflecting the stage of man's ceaseless inter- action with his reality. Perhaps one day even these notions would change, would evolve further. Perhaps it would be determined by man that time was not a separate form of organization but rather a derived form of space or energy. At that moment the notion of the world 'existing' before man would take on an entirely new meaning consistent with the changing forms of socially-organized knowledge. II Bogdanov's historical analysis provided a basis for understanding the interrelatedness of the physical and mental constellations through the historical interactions of group praxis. Yet the author 29 Ibid., p. 240.</page><page sequence="13">MARXIST PHENOMENOLOGY OF BOGDANOV 53 still did not see his task as completed. In distinction from the specula- tive, contemplative philosophers of the West, Bogdanov consciously perceived himself as the representative of a new, superior class, the European proletariat. This very superiority lay in the distinctive features of this class's socially-organized knowledge, features which reflected and justified its ability to organize the future society. It was not that the proletariat somehow 'knew more' than its rival, the European bourgeoisie. Rather, its superiority lay in its more ad- vanced forms of organization, first among which was the under- standing of causality. Perhaps of equal importance for Bogdanov, the proletariat's conception of causality provided the final link in his own attempt to bind the mental and physical constellations into an interacting monistic view of reality. Causality, akin to other forms of socially-organized knowledge, had a long history prior to the twentieth century. Man's first, primitive stage of existence, Bogdanov argued, was nearly devoid of this organizational form. It was only 'traditional habit' to expect one event to follow after another: the sun rises, the birds sing; an animal is hit by stone, there is no movement. There was a direct labouring relation to the world but there was no interpretation of the event which occurred.30 Only with the emergence of the authoritarian society, patriarchial, then feudal, did the form of causality make its distinct appearance in the organizational scheme of knowledge. At this stage, the cause was conceptualized as calling forth the effect, an anthropomorphic substitution modelled upon the structure of existing social relations: Cause rules over effect as something stronger, more active, more impor- tant, over the weaker, the passive, the less essential: in general as the superior over the inferior. The cause in principle is greater than the effect.3' Bourgeois society, in turn, developed its own understanding of causality consistent with the nature of social interaction: Causal connection is represented according to the form of economic necessity; hidden beyond the phenomena, natural necessity engenders both the causes and their effects; the effects necessarily follow after the cause - such is their dependence. The effect can be qualitatively and quantitatively distinguished from the cause, it can be other than it, can be greater or lesser than it.32 But since bourgeois society was divided into classes, the proletariat, having a separate relation to the means of production (a separate 30 Ibid., p. 226. al Ibid. 32 Ibid., p. 227.</page><page sequence="14">54 MICHAEL M. BOLL form of praxis), soon developed its own causal forms. An original if unsatisfactory expression of this new causal principle emerged as the Marxist notion of the dialectic. The actual origin of dialectics, Bogdanov maintained, lay in conversation, in discussion and dispute. 'The dialectic, strictly speaking, is the art of quarrelling.'33 Thus a worker and his co- worker discuss the best means to achieve some end. Each states his opinion, each defends his opinion by reference to what is likely to occur if his method is followed, and finally a compromise is reached. As we can see, here the dialectic is nothing other than an organizational process proceeding by the path of contradiction or, what is the same thing, by the path of struggle of different tendencies.34 The problem with the Marxist formulation lay in moving the dialectic into the realm of inorganic (less-organized) nature. Engels attempted to apply the concept of negation to the world in general. Does the placid scheme of discourse where two opinions of the conver- sants are mutually denied and then somehow reconciled fit the harsh struggle of elementary, spiritless forces of the universe? Does this scheme explain anything? Does it make the facts more understandable? Obviously no. This is naive sociomorphism and therefore scientifically unsuitable.35 Equal problems result from the attempted application of dialectics to motion. Engels's discussion of the 'contradiction' of a body being in a given place and not being in that place, an apparent contradic- tion in the laws of mechanics, is, to Bogdanov, only a contradiction in the concepts of motion, and not a contradiction in reality: In this case Engels, like Zeno, reveals only the contradiction of two concepts [ponyatiya] as applied to movement, the concept 'finds-itself- there', and 'not-finds-itself-there', and not a contradiction of real forces or tendencies. But the contradiction of two concepts is only ideal, the existing contradiction is only in thinking; to reduce physical facts to it - movement - means to go over to the idealist point of view, to return to the dialectic of Hegel instead of creating a materialistic dialectic.36 The correct view of the dialectic, Bogdanov concluded after a nine- page critique of Engels, is to understand it as: ... an organizing process proceeding by the path of struggle of opposite tendencies. Does this coincide with the understanding of Marx? 33 Ibid., p. 179. 84 Ibid., p. i8o. 35 Ibid., p. 208. 35 Ibid., p. 202.</page><page sequence="15">MARXIST PHENOMENOLOGY OF BOGDANOV 55 Obviously not completely: there [in Marx] the affair proceeds with respect to development and not concerning the organizing process.37 Thus the basic concept of the dialectic in Marx, as in Hegel, does not achieve full clarity and finality, and due to this, the very application of the dialectical method is done with imprecision and lack of distinct- ness.... 38 This, however, does not mean that the notion of dialectical causality should be entirely rejected. Life is actually dialectic but not in the sense that an organism contra- dicts itself, being simultaneously 'there' and 'not there'. No, the essence [sut'] is otherwise; the organism is struggling with its environ- ment; it uninterruptedly surrenders its energies to it ... and uninter- ruptedly assimilates energy from it; it remains 'there' in so far as these two processes approach approximate equilibrium; it becomes otherwise, 'not-there' in so far as one of these predominates over the other.39 For Bogdanov, the 'contradictions' of the dialectic operate not within a given form of being but between a being and its environment: A body always moves in some environment, i.e. in spatial relations with other things. This environment renders resistance to it, an opposing to the mechanical energy of transference. This opposition can be great or small depending upon the environment, be it water, solid, etc., but it exists and gradually destroys the force of movement. While the force exceeds it, motion continues. At a certain moment there is equilibrium and the body stops.... Here we have not only 'contradiction' or more accurately, counter-action - a term much better suited for a materialistic dialectic; here there is even the transition from quantita- tive change to qualitative ...40 But if the dialectic was imprecise and unsuited for a fully materialistic understanding of causality, what principle did Bogdanov offer as a replacement? Consistent with his belief that causality arose in the praxis of the group's interaction with nature, Bogdanov suggested a causal (organizing) principle derived from proletariat life experience: The proletariat is the class of labour, the direct productive class. In its work, the resistance of nature is counterposed to it, nature which it overcomes by its own regular efforts.... From here [arises] an active relation to the world, from here [arises] the watchword: 'change the world'. 37 Ibid., pp. 200-I. 88 Ibid., p. 20!. 39 Ibid., p. 204. 40 Ibid., pp. 203-4.</page><page sequence="16">56 MICHAEL M. BOLL What is the method ? The systematic and planned transformation offorces or more precisely and scientifically, the transformation of energies. Such is the essence of the machine technique.41 In its work experience, every phenomenon is perceived as a source for another through the process of transformation and conversion. Coal and oxygen are perceived as a means to heat, heat as a means to steam, and steam, in turn, as a means of driving the piston and flywheel. By such means, the forces of nature are made into the forces of the working collective; each of them is able to become for it [the collective] a mechanical source of every other similar task presented to labour.42 This means that every phenomenon, every process of nature is a possible source for the labouring collective of mastering some other process. In this consists the practical connection of phenomena, the practical unity of nature.43 Here at last was the new model of causality indigenous to the working class and emerging through its own praxis. If A is the cause of B, this simply means that A is converted into B in a manner analogous to and derived from the technical transformation of coal into heat. In distinction to earlier notions of causality, in this approach: 'The cause is equal to the effect.'42 Indeed, the cause and effect are identical although perceived in two different forms, as when a ton of coal is defined as so many BTUs of energy. Nature is but the sum total of energies which may be recast into other forms of energy according to the needs of the collective: We have already said that knowledge in its higher stage is not only a description and explanation of the world process but likewise a pro- gramme of world development - not only a map of the theatre of war of mankind with its elements, but likewise a plan of campaign against it. Now we see that in the idea of labour-causality there is included an actual programme and plan for the conquest of the world: to master phenomena step by step in order from one to obtain others expe- diently, and by means of some to overcome others.44 With this principle of causality derived from the life experience of the proletariat, Bogdanov finally reached an organizational explanation adequate to overcome the dualistic aspects inherent in Empirio- criticism. If the world is perceived as sets of elements capable of 41 Ibid., p. 222.

Equally important, the causal principle of univer- sal and exhaustive transformation reveals an even more basic monistic relationship of mind and matter. Mind, or 'my' mental complexes are only the transformed energy accompanying changing brain states. What is mind for me is an identical phenomenon with what the Other (in this case a surgeon or group of surgeons) sees as alternating changes in brain tissue. Brain does not 'produce' mind or somehow cause it as the earlier materialists maintaiined. Mind is changing brain states as they are perceived under the rubric of the physical, it is the constellation KLM within the ABC, just as heat is coal burning. If light is the wave motion of the ether in its changed form as it is perceived by our senses, if matter represents complexes of electrical processes in an equally changed appearance, then brain with its physiological life turns out to be [okazyvayetsya] the psyche itself in its converted appearance as it is perceived by people in their physical experience. From the point of view of causal connection, this is one and the same sum of energy in its two phases, belonging to different provinces of experience.45 It has been written that a great man dies twice; once when the spirit leaves the body, and the second time when his works are over- turned and rejected. Sadly this was true of Bogdanov, although here the second death preceded the first. In the highly politicized world of fledgling Russian social democracy, Bogdanov was subjected to ceaseless criticism from the more 'orthodox' leaders of the movement. Between i 908 and i9io, Plekhanov wrote over one hundred pages of refutation, challenging Bogdanov's ties to the Marxist legacy. Lenin, in his Materialism and Empiriocriticism, claimed that Bogdanov's 'creativity' was little more than a rehash of earlier idealistic sup- porters of bourgeois society. In neither of these rebuttals will the reader discover a non-partisan evaluation of Bogdanov's apparent genius; an inevitable result when philosophical purity takes prece- dence over philosophical speculation. Similar negative appraisals dot contemporary Soviet histories of philosophy,46 and the absence of adequate translations of Bogdanov's central philosophical works has limited evaluations by Western philosophers. "5 Ibid., p. 254. 46 See for example, the discussion in V. E. Yevgrafov et al., Istoriyafilosofii v SSSR, Moscow, 1971, vol. 4, p. 257. A more balanced view of Bogdanov is given in the recent study by V. I. Ksenofontov, Leninskiye idei v sovetskoyfilosofskoy nauke 20-kh godov, Leningrad, 1975. It is too early to tell whether this reflects a re-appraisal of Bogdanov's philosophy in the U.S.S.R. today.</page><page sequence="18">58 MICHAEL M. BOLL Despite continued verbal and written assaults, Bogdanov extended his philosophical speculations and social activities well into the i92os. His mammoth study of systems of organization, Vseobshwhaya organizatsionnaya nauka (Tektologiya) (Universal Systematically Or- ganized Science: Textology) appeared in I9I3, with the second part published four years later. Although Bogdanov disagreed with the Bolshevik position in 19I7, he became the leader of a movement for proletarian culture in Soviet society. His influence can be seen in the later writings of Nikolay Bukharin, but his ability to form a specific school of Marxist phenomenology was precluded by the very victory of socialism in Russia. In i926 Bogdanov organized the State Institute of Blood Transfusion, dying in I928 as the result of a blood experiment upon himself. Perhaps the best analysis of Bogdanov's life and works was penned by the American scholar Alexander Vucinich: Although he was ignored by the wide spectrum of idealistic philosophers and bitterly condemned by orthodox Marxists, including both Plekhanov and Lenin, Bogdanov was one of the most original, productive, and accomplished Russian social philosophers of his genera- tion. Few Russian sociologists matched the depth of his analysis, the scope of his interests, and the courage of his pioneering zeal.47 It is to be hoped that future studies will finally restore Bogdanov to a central position in twentieth-century Russian philosophical thought. 47Vucinich, op. cit., p. 230.</page></plain_text>
