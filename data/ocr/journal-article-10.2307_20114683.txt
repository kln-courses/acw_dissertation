<plain_text><page sequence="1">HILDE HEIN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM: THE ENDURING DISPUTE BETWEEN MECHANISM AND VITALISM Every civilization has its mythology; and one of the predominant myths of our modern western civilization is that scientific inquiry guides man kind progressively toward increased understanding of the nature of reality. Science, it is alleged, advances through the repudiation of its own mistakes; and the history of science is the debris laden trail of abandoned theories and disputes which have been finally laid to rest. Guided by this conception of science, one is inclined to regard the very contemporaneity of a theory as a justification of it; for it evidently did prevail over competitors which now are valued only out of antiquarian concern. Thus, such historic controversies as that over phlogiston or the aether are viewed with mild condescension as representative of the naive gropings of our intellectually inferior ancestors. It is my contention that this linear view of scientific progress is at best an oversimplification of the process of rational inquiry and more probably a gross distortion of it. I maintain that human reasoning takes place within certain frameworks which are themselves defensible, but not justi fiable on rational grounds. I have argued elsewhere [1] that some historic scientific controversies are not truly theoretical or doctrinal clashes which may be adjudicated by the standard appeal to scientific evidence, but are in fact meta-theoretical disagreements. Such disputes reflect differences in fundamental philosophical commitments. The origin and etiology of these commitments is beyond my comprehension, and should no doubt be investigated as a psycho-sociological or cultural phenomenon. But that such commitments exist and that they differ seems to me beyond doubt; and I believe that they determine our life styles, our political attitudes, and our mode of carrying on rational inquiry. I should argue, further, that these commitments follow recurrent patterns which are again and again revealed in disputes which appear to be concerned with substantive issues. They determine our beliefs regard ing the nature of things and above all they govern our beliefs about the proper mode of asking questions about things. Synthese 20(1969) 238-253; ? D. Reidel Publishing Co., Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 239 I have argued that the classic controversy between mechanism and vitalism is an instance of meta-theoretical disagreement; that what is represented as a scientific issue resolvable by appeal to evidence is an issue at all only in view of the fact that mechanists and vitalists adhere to different patterns of commitment. In the present paper I shall argue that the meta-theoretical issues which were present in the traditional mechanism-vitalism controversy are echoed in the contemporary dispute between molecular biology and organicist biology. While there is no question today of 'vital stuffs' or 'entelechies', nor of the crude mechanical models of the 17th-century mechanists, there is in the contemporary division among biologists, a perpetuation of the same fundamental disagreement along meta-theoretical lines that allies molecular biologists with the mechanists of the past and organicists with traditional vitalism. Mechanists and Vitalists in the past have differed over questions relating to the nature and origin of life and the status of biology as a science independent of physics and chemistry. They have debated the ultimacy of the distinction commonly made between the animate and the inanimate and the degree to which processes characteristic of living things can be understood in terms of concepts drawn from the physical sciences. I shall assume, in the present study, that the specific content of their arguments is familiar. But let me specify briefly what I take to be some of the earmarks of a dispute which is meta-theoretical rather than sub stantive in nature. (1) Such disputes tend to have a large polemic component. The rhetoric of defense and especially of attack upon opposing positions is frequently highly emotive and flamboyant, resorting to ad hominem argument and sometimes character assassination, rather than careful analysis and evalu ation of reasoning. (2) Much of the disagreement turns out to be methodological, rather than on factual issues. The problem is not so much the data to be expli cated, but the proper mode of its explication and even its identification; since the selection of data is to a large extent determined by the explana tory model employed. (3) Correlated with the preceding matter is the problem of evaluating evidence. Not only is there disagreement as to whether a given piece of evidence is sufficient or persuasive, but more importantly, the antagonists</page><page sequence="3">240 HILDE HEIN often refuse to accept as evidence what is offered as such by their op ponents. Corroborative arguments may be rejected as simply irrelevant or not to the point, even where their validity or truthful content is admitted. (4) Finally, metatheoretical alternatives are often defended for their heuristic value rather than on the supposition that they are true. The basis of their evaluation is then pragmatic, and may be variable, de pending upon the intention of their proponents. There may be other criteria of meta-theoretical disputes which I have failed to note. These, however, appear to me to be sufficient for recog nition; and they are notably realized in the controversy between mecha nism and vitalism. Let us now consider some representative statements by what I take to be the modern heirs of this controversy, molecular biologists and organ icists; and see how far their debate follows that of mechanists and vitalists: Speaking with the confidence of a mechanist concerning the nature of life, J. D. Watson says [2]: We see not only that the laws of chemistry are sufficient for understanding protein structure, but also that they are consistent with all known hereditary phenomena. Complete certainty now exists among essentially all biochemists that the other charac teristics of living organisms ... will all be completely understood in terms of the coordinative interactions of small and large molecules. Much is already known about the less complex features, enough to give us confidence that further research of the intensity recently given to genetics will eventually provide man with the ability to describe with completeness the essential features that constitute life. The difference between the living and the non-living is reduced to a matter of the complexity of the structure of elementary particles. Fantastically complicated though a large protein or nucleic acid may be, the problem its structure and properties pose to human understanding is one of degree, not of quality. [3] Revealing doubts that the mechanistic reductivist explanation ade quately accounts for life, Edmund Sinnott says: No one can deny the very great advances that have been made by the biochemical method of approach to biological problems or the boundless possibilities that are open before it, but an overemphasis of the molecular point of view may have unfortunate consequences... It will distract attention from the fact that there are fundamental problems of biology that have stubbornly resisted solution by chemical means alone.</page><page sequence="4">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 241 Conspicuous among these is the problem of form. This is no minor issue that can be swept under the rug and safely ignored in the hopeful belief that further biochemical progress will almost automatically clear it up. It must be kept in the forefront of our thinking and its solution attempted from every possible direction [4]. Sinnott goes on to characterize the problem of organic form as an instance of a universal manifestation; for form is evident at all levels of organization, from the electron through the social community. Never theless, he singles out the molecular biologists for failing to take seriously enough the causal inter-relations which occur between levels of organ ization. The structure and replication of DNA, isolated from cytoplasmic features and from environmental conditions, cannot, Sinnott believes, be sufficient to account for the phenomena of life. Form consists of relations among particles, of orderly patterns in them. It is a con tinuous entity and cannot be divided into pieces. A formed organic body, to be sure, consists of cells and molecules and atoms and all the other units of matter, but form does not inhere in these. It is a category of being very different from matter, for it is not the nature of the material particles themselves that is involved, but rather how they are related to one another. Form may disappear and reappear, as order yields to randomness or comes again, but matter (in its widest sense, as matter-energy) is conservative, moving toward uniformity and maximum entropy. Form on the contrary, is changing and creative [5]. Sinnott argues that the problem of form, while not a problem exclusively for the biologist, nonetheless prohibits the explanation of biological phenomena in the reductive terminology of the physical sciences. There must be something that organizes the random, diffuse members of a lower level into an orderly and formed system above it. It is among other things, the quest for this 'something' which differentiates the organicist biologists from their molecular counterparts. (1) Clearly there is no question here of 'special forces', and Francis Crick, in his repudiation of vitalism [6], is raising spectral red herrings when he admonishes: There are still people today who believe that the earth is flat, in spite of all the enormous accumulation of scientific evidence to the contrary. And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only cranks will believe tomorrow. The virulence of Crick's rhetoric in this and other passages where he speaks out even more strongly, suggests that his opposition to vitalism is based on primary commitments. This judgment is reinforced when</page><page sequence="5">242 HILDE HEIN one considers the men whom he chooses to include within the 'lunatic fringe' of vitalism.1 The organicists, for their part, are also not above the use of impassioned language2 and of attacks which bear upon the use to which their op ponents' arguments may be put, rather than upon the merit of the argu ments themselves. As distinguished a scientist as Barry Commoner, in a vice presidential address to the American Association for the Advancement of Science [9], deplores the effect of reductionism on the enterprise of science itself. Decrying the fact that bright young scientists prefer linking strands of DNA to mating Drosophila, Commoner says: ... as soon as an interesting and important biological problem becomes susceptible to chemical or physical attack, a process of alienation begins, and the question becomes, in the end, lost to biology. But in each case, the purely chemical - or physical - studies run their course and come to the blank wall that still surrounds the intimate events which occur within the living cell. The obvious need is to return home to biology. But now the errant science has long forgotten its home, and the mother is too be wildered by its fast-talking offspring to be very happy about welcoming it back into the family. In the end, he says, scientific inquiry is stultified. So long as this process of alienation affected only the end products of metabolism (such as starch, rubber, or pigments), the parent science suffered some damage, but no really lethal blow. But now biochemistry and biophysics have reached deep into the core of biology - to reproduction and inheritance - and the question arises as to how biology will survive this more penetrating attack. (2) Stressing the living wholeness of the biological entity, the organ icists reject the analytic methods of the molecular biologists, which they view as necessarily oversimplifying the subject matter with which they deal. Above all, they maintain, the small scale, in vitro analyses of mole cular biologists cannot reveal the large scale dynamics of the systemic processes that constitute living organisms. The molecular biologists claim, on the contrary that the dynamic, system building character of organisms can be accounted for in terms of a basic architectonic tendency inherent in the fundamental particles of matter itself. In line with this view, J. D. Bernai provisionally defines 'life' as "a partial, continuous, progressive, multiform and conditionally interactive, self-realization of the potenti alities of atomic electron states" [10]. In so far as life is a natural phase of matter, it is supposed that it is subject to the same mode of experi</page><page sequence="6">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 243 mental examination as is appropriate to other phases of matter. It is clear that the partisans of both sides agree that living things exhibit organization and that it must be accounted for. Their disagree ment is over how this is to be done; for the organicists, following the vitalists of the past, insist that there must be some organizational princi ple, something which marks the difference between a sheer aggregation of parts and an organized whole in the grip of which the parts "do not blindly run, but run in accordance with the whole of which they form a part" [11]. The molecular biologists, denying this need for an extrinsic organizational principle, affirm that the forces deriving from the arrange ment of electric charges of the elemental particles account not merely for the structure of matter, but also for its behavior in accordance with principles of 'self-assembly'. In view of this tendency, Bernai ascribes to matter "a geometrical beauty of a type that Plato would have much appreciated". Increasingly, molecular biologists have come to regard the self as sembly of matter as following the model of organic reproduction. Para doxically, the notion of biological heredity, once thought to be uniquely applicable to animate species, is now taken to be simply an extension or manifestation of the more fundamental replication which takes place at the molecular level. The growth and development of the living organism is governed by the replication of nucleic acids which determine the as semblage of proteins and hence the entire construction of the organism. Given the uniformity of the process, the amenability to experimental observation of its initial stages promises that later phases will eventually be understood by the same method. Just as reproduction which once was conceived as an organic phe nomenon now is thought to take place at the molecular level as well, so is the notion of evolution extended from its usual application to organic species to refer also to pre-organic modifications. The term 'chemical evolution' is used by modern biologists to refer to the alterations of matter which allegedly occurred on earth during a period of 4.5 billion years, prior to the appearance of the first organism. According to the principle of 'self-assembly', the evolution of the first organism (or the 'eobiont', using N. W. Pirie's vocabulary) is a matter of probability; but it is a likelihood which, because of the enormous length of time available to it, approaches certainty.</page><page sequence="7">244 HILDE HEIN When we consider the spontaneous origin of a living organism, this is not an event that need happen again and again. It is perhaps enough for it to happen once. The probability with which we are concerned is of a special kind; it is the probability that an event occurs at least once. To this type of probability a fundamentally important thing happens as one increases the number of trials. However improbable the event in a single trial, it becomes increasingly probable as the trials are multiplied. Eventually the event becomes virtually inevitable. ... The important point is that, since the origin of life belongs in the category of at least-once phenomena, time is on its side. However improbable we regard this event, or any of the steps which it involves, given enough time it will almost certainly happen at least once. And for life as we know it, with its capacity for growth and reproduction, once may be enough [12].3 Molecular biologists are not confined to speculation about the proba bility of self-assembly. While no direct confirmation is possible of what actually took place on earth when life began, evidence may be accumu lated in the form of analytic models and experimental systems presumed to be analogous to living systems. Advanced laboratory techniques have made possible direct access to components of living systems whose existence, to say nothing of their structure and function, were matters of conjecture in the past. Complex life activities may be broken down into their sub-processes, which may be studied in isolation in vitro, and which, in turn, give rise to larger conceptual models. It is meaningful to proceed by asking, 'Given the present state of organic life and our knowledge of physical laws and the historic past, what circumstances could have brought about that state?' One may then build models which replicate those circumstances and observe what happens. It is important to bear in mind that whatever occurs, no defini tive proof is given, for events might always have taken place differently. Nonetheless, especially if independent evidence can be given favoring the occurrence of the inferred circumstances, then the case for their historical existence is strengthened. According to the theory first formulated by A. I. Oparin, and made available in English in 1936 [14], the primordial atmosphere of the earth was an (anoxygenic) reducing environment in which primitive inorganic substances and hydrocarbons combined over a long period of time and under the stimulation of solar radiation or electric discharges to form organic compounds. There is now independent evidence from geology and astronomy that the earth's early atmosphere was anoxygenic, and,</page><page sequence="8">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 245 while there is disagreement concerning the specific features of this atmos phere, e.g. the temperature of the primordial 'soup' of elements, the specific character of the energy source, and even the exact chemical nature of the primary elements, there are model experiments substanti ating the hypothesis that life could have originated under a variety of plausible conditions. Of these, the most famous experiment was performed by S. L. Miller, in 1953 [15], Miller arranged an apparatus which circulated a solution of methane, ammonia, hydrogen and water, the presumed primitive com pounds, past an electric spark. In a week's time he found that a number of organic compounds had been formed, including several amino-acids, the building blocks of protein. Further experiments by others revealed that amino acids derived in this fashion could indeed be combined to form proteinoid compounds. Similar experiments in the artificial synthe sis of compounds crucial to living systems (e.g. nucleic acids) reinforce the claim of modern mechanistic biologists that elemental matter, left to itself in adequate circumstances will assemble itself to organize com pounds of increasingly complex nature, eventually achieving the state of a living system. Thus no appeal to external organizational principles is required. Organicists, in denying the principle of self-assembly of matter, affirm not merely that it is necessary to explain the fact of organization, but further that the hierarchical ordering of levels must be accounted for such that the causal connection between levels and the ordering principle of the whole are made evident. In other words, it is not sufficient to describe the constituent parts and their formal relations among themselves. Over and above the descriptive pattern is a principle which organizes the parts in terms of the whole in which they are a part. But this principle is not accessible to the analytic and experimental techniques of molecular bi ology. The role of each part is not exhaustively determined by its own constituent elements, but depends in part upon its position within the whole. Whatever one takes the unit of life to be - and organicists them selves are not in agreement on this - the character of any level of living matter - cell, tissue, organ, organism - is determined from above to at least as great an extent as from below. Paul Weiss, in an article entitled 'The Cell as Unit' [16], makes this point in objecting to the description of a cell in terms of its composition</page><page sequence="9">246 HILDE HEIN of molecules and their component atomic and sub-atomic units. This procedure, he says, fails to differentiate between a live and a dead cell, or even a dead cell and a homogenate of a physically disintegrated system. Despite his acknowledgement of the spectacular successes of molecular biologists in synthesizing 'higher-order' systems from 'lower-order' ele ments, he warns against undue optimism in this regard, since most of it is held "in direct proportion to the lack of first-hand and penetrating acquaintance with the living cell as a whole [Weiss' emphasis], which is a unit rather than a sheer summative assemblage or conglomerate". The scientist can analyze the various component activities of cell life in iso lation, but the cell itself carries them out simultaneously by harmoniously coordinated interactions which are not replicated by the experiment. Indeed, the experiment gives the impression that the macromolecular subunits of the cell exert 'molecular control of cellular activity' ; but this impression fails to take into account the fact that the key to the power which the sub-units exert is due to a kind of 'prefitting' which is imparted to them "as members of just such an organized group unit". The group unit, as well, acts as a whole, according to organicist obser vations. Cellular differentiation and development, it is argued, are not wholly determined genetically, but are in part a function of their situation within the organism and even of the environmental adaptation of the organism. It has been suggested that nothing less than an entire embryo or organism is sufficient to consistently provide all of the correct sub strates, hormones, and enzymes, at the right place and at the right time for a specific and characteristic cellular interaction to occur. Hence experiments with a partial system are necessarily misleading. In the area of perception, it has been argued by Lettvin et al. [17] that characteristic animal behavior that has resisted explanation by analytic breakdown is understandable when approached from the point of view of the 'meaningfulness' of the action to the whole organism which exhibits it.4 In line with these observations, organicists reject accounts of life which take as their model anything less than the entire organism. Consequently, they tend also to be contemptuous of the "somewhat fictitious and over simplified model systems" employed by molecular biologists. At best, they claim, these have only a coincidental resemblance to the living systems they are designed to duplicate. Denied such models, however,</page><page sequence="10">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 247 and having no more direct access to the origins of life than molecular biologists, the organicists are not in a position to make well-founded judgments concerning this matter. Furthermore, they face the logical dilemma imposed by their holistic orientation that, if the whole is prior to its parts, then the appearance of the whole cannot be explicated as evolving out of them except in some mystical fashion. (3) This difficulty points to a deeper discrepancy between molecular biologists and organicists; for it becomes clear that their difference is not over this or that experimental procedure ; but over the basic frame work within which experimental evidence is meaningful at all. Organicists do not deny the accuracy and elegance of the analyses performed by molecular biologists; but they view these as merely partial and schematic, and hence not as reflecting the whole nature of the bio logical subject. Experimental evidence relates to what goes on in a synthetic laboratory system; but this has little, if any, bearing upon the nature of living processes. Denied the methodological techniques of molecular biology, however, organicists are limited to negative criticism of their opponents supple mented by philosophical speculation based to some extent upon obser vation. Philosophically, organicism readily assumes an idealistic position according to which all individual wholes are merely transient moments within the self-realization of an all-encompassing whole which is the ground of their being and their scientific rationalization. In effect, idealism is the metaphysical counterpart to the material claim of 'functional interaction'. Idealism affirms that no part can be understood as disconnected from the whole of which it is a part; indeed to regard an element as a part is implicitly to subsume its nature to that of the whole from which it derives its identity. It follows that analysis of anything less than the whole is necessarily a distortion, and that, temporal appearances notwithstanding, the whole is logically prior to the parts. Short of this wholly metaphysical analysis, organicists may adopt a finalistic or orthogenetic position with respect to the origin of life and its development. Teilhard de Chardin, for example, who was an evo lutionist and therefore acknowledged novelty in the sequence of species development, viewed this development as linear, moving toward a goal which is 'virtually' contained in its antecedents and which exerts a kind of drawing power. Thus conceived the phases of matter are ideologically</page><page sequence="11">248 HILDE HEIN related, the end exerting a dynamic, or erotic, influence upon the steps to its fulfillment. While the orthogenetic view accommodates the appearance of historical development more satisfactorily than the idealistic position, which treats it as illusory, both 'solutions' to the puzzle of origins, share the funda mentally Aristotelian conviction that the cause must be 'richer' than the effect; must indeed 'contain' it, as the premises of a valid deductive argu ment entail the conclusion that follows from them. Wherever change occurs, it must be due to the imposition of form by an active principle upon something which relative to it, is passive. This concept of change has dominated all vitalistic doctrines, all of which have fixated upon the Aristotelian definition of matter as essentially passive.5 The a priori conviction of the passivity of matter is clearly incompatible with the presumption of the molecular biologists that matter has the inherent power of spontaneous self-assembly. But the rejection of this capacity is not based on experimentation or even observation. Indeed no empirical test would be relevant to the claim. For it is not denied that organization takes place. Here organicists and molecular biologists agree. They disagree over why and how it happens. And for the vitalists, the very definition of matter precludes its active agency, while this is not the case for mechanists. But since no evidence can establish or refute a defi nition, no test tube experiments could persuade an organicist that the organization of matter which he perceives is due to anything other than an ordering principle. The ordering principle, being active, must be wholly other in nature from the inert matter upon which it acts6, and hence external to it. As such, it may be conceived of as occupying another, and higher, level. The ascription of a 'higher' or superior level to the ordering principle is not coincidental. Carried along implicitly with the Aristotelian notion of the passivity of matter is the prejudice that the active is inherently superior to the passive, the cause not merely logically (and ontologically) prior to the effect, but also axiologically prior to it. Hence the value of matter is relatively inferior to that which informs it. This is why there never has been any doubt among vitalists that the life force (or whatever designation is given to the vital principle) is higher in value than the material substratum which it informs; and that principle is still prevalent among the organicist biologists who maintain that there must be a supra</page><page sequence="12">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 249 elemental, or, as Weiss calls it, a 'super-ordinating' principle of regu lation beyond the elements which are organized. While contemporary biologists no longer regard this principle as substantive, or energetic, or as 'contrary to nature', it nonetheless marks, in their estimation, a distinct break in the natural order of things, such that in view of its presence, the science which deals with living things is and must be independent of and irreducible to the science dealing with the inanimate universe.7 Organicism, then, like all previous forms of vitalism, in insisting upon the autonomy of biology, reveals a readiness to accept as ultimate a dis continuity (or series of discontinuities) in the universe. Accordingly, it also runs counter to the prevailing tendency among reductionists to affirm the unity of science.8 (4) Opponents of vitalism have regarded this readiness to accept dis continuity as one of the most serious weaknesses of vitalistic doctrines. The objection is based on the heuristic principle of the economy of scientific methodology. If the reliably tested techniques and modes of inquiry are rejected as inapplicable to certain types of phenomena - even granting that 'other laws' and methods of inquiry might be discoverable - then the enterprise of science is stultified. For the ideal of science, as it is widely understood, is to subsume the widest possible spectrum of phe nomena under the fewest possible laws and principles. If vitalists make a priori exceptions which they defend as unamenable to scientific expla nation, they are violating the spirit under which science is undertaken. Arguing from what is not known to what is unknowable, they are too easily satisfied with obscurantist labels that sanctify a gap such as that between the living and the non-living, but do not explain it. Expecting the inexplicable, they are prepared to accept the failure to explain as a revelation of ultimate surds. On the other hand, the methodological optimism of the mechanists is subject to criticism by vitalists on the heuristic ground that 'proven' techniques and patterns of explanation will be used conservatively and dictatorially; that the rich diversity of experience is tailored to fit the rules, rather than the reverse. Like the drunk who hunts for his house key under the street lamp rather than on the dark street where he lost it, mechanists may be contriving inquiries to suit the capacities of their laboratory facilities, instead of allowing the phenomena to dictate the character of their investigations.</page><page sequence="13">250 HILDE HEIN In the absence of certain answers to clear questions, both mechanism and vitalism can claim heuristic supremacy. Much of the history of biology may be regarded as a sequence of vitalistic retractions against the encroachments of mechanism. Mechanists have successively done away with vital substances, forces, entelechies, and have increasingly assimilated living processes to those which take place in the realm of inanimate objects. Yet vitalists are constantly prepared with a new challenge. If circulation and respiration can be accounted for mecha nistically, there is still metabolism, adaptation and regeneration. And if these are no longer obscure, there is the problem of replication and differentiation. Even now, when molecular biologists are satisfied that heredity is no longer a problem, there is a new rallying of vitalistic re sistance on the neuro-physiological frontier.9 That very adventurousness which lends molecular biology its current glamour and popularity may well be the consequence of vitalistic stimulation which is perpetuated by the organicist biologists. 1 have argued here that the controversy between organicism and mo lecular biology is not an isolated historical dispute; but is a manifestation of a perennial disagreement between two types of meta-theoretical com mitment. I do not make this claim simply to point out an interesting historical continuity, nor to demonstrate to the progressivists that nothing ever changes, at least at the level of emotive associations. Rather, I have been struck by the manner in which these two antagonists, which 1 have identified as mechanism and vitalism (although they might be differently labelled as e.g. reductionism and non-reductionism, analyticism (?) and holism) serve both as spurs and as constraints upon one another. With out making any claims regarding the superiority of either one over the other, or any predictions of ultimate victory, I should like to point out the intellectual benefit which results from the clash of these two positions. I do not know if there is such a thing as scientific progress, but if there is, I think it would not occur if men of conviction were not challenged by opposing convictions to constantly re-examine and, where necessary, revise their own beliefs. That the convictions themselves, as well as the challenges, are not necessarily rational in origin or due to the examination of evidence does not seem to me to be a mark against them. Nor is it a failing that the same prejudices reassert themselves in constantly new guises.10 Ration</page><page sequence="14">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 251 ality demands that we submit our beliefs to critical scrutiny, and that we expose them to open conflict with opposing points of view. It does not require that we be super-humanly free of prejudice to begin with. BIBLIOGRAPHY [1] 'Mechanism and Vitalism as Meta-theoretical Commitments', Philosophical Forum 1,2 (Winter, 1968) 185.

REFERENCES 1 Crick refers explicitly to Walter Elsasser, Peter Mora, and Eugene Wigner, none of</page><page sequence="15">252 HILDE HEIN whom are generally thought to be ripe for a mental institution. Having questioned their sanity, Crick goes on to attribute religious bigotry to them [7]. 2 The very titles of some of the articles written in denunciation of molecular biology have a petulant tone: e.g. the February, 1964, issue of BioScience carries an article by Robert Zuck with the provocative title 'Molecular Botany - A New Anti-Intellectu alism' [8]. 3 There is, however, no necessity that life did originate only once. It is compatible with mechanism as well as with vitalism to affirm that life had several beginnings. There are in fact contemporary theories which affirm that even now life is continuously being created anew, but that the new forms are either destroyed by more advantaged compe tition or are so similar to the now existing living forms that they are virtually indis tinguishable from them and hence remain unnoticed [13]. 4 Lettvin has found in working with individual neurons of the optic nerve of the frog that "Every such cell ... acts so complexly that we can hardly describe its response save in terms ordinarily reserved for animal behavior." The eye of the frog is responsive to a fly (or a fly-like object which crosses its field of vision); unresponsive to the light flashes ordinarily used as stimuli in analytically oriented experiments. It is tempting to offer explanations in terms of what is 'meaningful' to the organism, but that ex pression is clearly metaphorical and anthropomorphic. Nonetheless, it may open avenues for further experimental inquiry. 5 For Aristotle the term 'matter' has a relativistic connotation: that which is matter in one context (e.g. a piece of cloth, which is the matter of a toga) may be form in another (e.g. the wool of the sheep which is woven into the cloth). But in all instances the matter is passive with respect to the form imposed upon it, and at the ultimate state of primary matter, if it exists, it is wholly without activity, without attributes, and receptive to form. 6 One might suppose that this poses a problem for interaction, as it did for the Carte sian mind-body dualists, who having separated mind and body essentially, thereby dissolved the ground of causal interaction. The Aristotelian view of matter, however, avoids this complication; for the passivity (potency) of matter is precisely that which fits it to be receptive to form. In this sense it possesses virtually, though not in actuality, whatever form is imposed upon it. 7 There are, of course, more traditional expressions of vitalism still current. In a recent article entitled 'In Defense of Vitalism', D. Dix, a practicing biochemist, affirms that the relations within non-living systems can be expressed kinetically and thermodynam ically in terms of energy. But this is not the case for living systems whose parts are not exclusively energy related, but are related in terms of survival advantage. This suggests that life has a 'non-molecular goal' and leads Dix to the conclusion that "the force which is the drive toward the maximum benefit be called the vitalistic principle" [18]. 8 There is, however, a contemporary movement endorsed by a number of organicists, as well as cybemeticists and general semanticists, which aims to defend the unity of science without sacrificing the doctrine of 'levels' introduced by organicism. This is General Systems Theory, which rejects both the mysticism of traditional vitalism and the reductionism of traditional mechanism. Systems theorists deny that life represents a phenomenon which is structurally unique in the universe. The basis of their defense of the unity of science is the claim that there is replication or isomorphy of structural uniformity to be found at different strata of reality. There is, they say, a hierarchical order of organized entities from the physical and chemical to the biological and socio logical systems; and the "Unity of science is granted, not by a Utopian reduction of all</page><page sequence="16">MOLECULAR BIOLOGY VS. ORGANICISM 253 sciences to physics and chemistry, but by the structural uniformities of the different levels of reality" [19]. Like traditional vitalists, systems theorists affirm that biological concepts have no application on lower levels of organization. However, since similar breaks occur between other levels of organization, this does not mark life as a unique phenomenon - no more unique relative to inanimate matter than atoms are relative to electrons, or molecules, relative to atoms. In all of these cases there is a sense in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, but the uniformity of the repetition of this pattern is precisely what renders the total system of systems a unity. Systems theory leaves a number of unanswered questions, particularly concerning those causal relations between levels which justify our identification of them as distinct but isomorphic. Furthermore, the characterization of an aggregate as a system pre supposes certain prior convictions which may be ill formed for one reason or another, and at the very least are relative to one's purposes. 9 Recent history in molecular biology reinforces the hypothesis I am defending that the principle opposition of the mechanism-vitalism controversy is replicated at every level of scientific investigation. It is curious that in the very heart of the mechanist camp there should have been a division between the so-called 'structurists' on the one hand and the 'informationists' on the other [19]. The structurists believed that a com plete three-dimensional description of a cell or macro-molecule would suffice to account for its physiological function. The informationists denied the sufficiency of the structur al explanation and looked instead for a one-dimensional molecular hereditary infor mation carrier. According to one of the members of this second group [20], its parti cipants were motivated by the 'romantic idea' that living matter would be inexplicable in terms of the known laws of physics and would require the discovery of 'other laws'. When this hope was disappointed by the discovery of the structure of DNA, many 'romantics' moved into the study of the nervous system in hopes of finding a new barrier that would require the appeal to 'other laws'. And within the field of neuro biology, the state of knowledge concerning human consciousness has been compared [21] to the state of biology at the height of the crisis between molecular biology and organicism. 10 It has in fact been my aim in this paper to show how the same prejudices do recur in every generation and at every stage of scientific inquiry. While one pattern of thought may gain temporary ascendancy within an individual or a civilization; invariably its opponent arises in appropriate contemporary form and brings about its modification.</page></plain_text>
