<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Fagade of Leone Leoni's House in Milan, the Casa degli Omenoni: The Artist and the Public MICHAEL P. MEZZATESTA Kimbell Art Museum Leone Leoni's house in Milan, the Casa degli Omenoni, is one of the city's most distinctive architectural landmarks. It has long earned the attention and admiration of visitors, particularly for its unusualfaade decorated with six over-life-sized barbarian prisoners and two half- length caryatids flanking the central portal. Figures of this kind had never been seen on a house or palace faCade before they appeared here. This article analyzes the sculptural and architectural sources of these figures as well as the architectural sources of the facade in general. The Casa degli Omenoni is placed within the context of the three major facade types at mid-century, in order to further clarify its innovative qualities. Finally, the iconology is discussed, with Leoni's dedication of the house to Marcus Aurelius seen in relation to the popularity of two books on the ancient emperor by the court historian of Charles V, Fray Antonio de Guevara. The prisoner motif is linked to the Persian Portico, and the famous frieze relief showing lions attacking a satyr is related to a similar device in Filarete's palace for the pseudonymous architect Onitoan Noliaver. It will be seen that Leoni presented himself to the public less as an artist than as a gentleman in the social camp of the Hapsburgs. LEONE LEONI'S house in Milan, the Casa degli Omenoni, is one of the city's most distinctive architectural landmarks. Lo- cated just a few steps north of the Duomo, it has long earned the attention and admiration of visitors for its unusual facade decorated with a frieze relief showing two lions attacking a satyr and especially for the six over-life-sized barbarian prisoners and two half-length caryatids flanking the central portal (Figs. i, 2).1 Imposing figures of this sort never had been seen on a house or palace facade before they appeared on the Casa degli Omenoni. It is not surprising, therefore, that these captives gave a new name to the street they face: the Via degli Omenoni, "street of the big men" in the Milanese dialect.2 Yet in addition to the place it occupies in architectural history, Leoni's house is of interest for the insight it provides into the artist's public per- sonality. This article attempts to analyze that personality, to identify the innovative aspects of the facade, and to present a more comprehensive explication of the house's iconology. In so doing, the Casa degli Omenoni will emerge as an example of the Renaissance artist's struggle to gain professional and social acceptance, a struggle in which his own home was a major weapon. The Casa degli Omenoni thus helps us to understand Leoni as an artist and a man. As we will see, his home was both a demonstration of artistic ingegno and an avowal of a code of honor which reveals the artist's self-perception and social as- pirations. In May of 566 Giorgio Vasari, returning to Italy from France, was Leone Leoni's guest in Milan.3 Vasari's visit, which lasted 15 days, must have been particularly pleasant, for he had the chance to enjoy the hospitality of a fellow Aretine and to see proof of his friend's success-the new facade and courtyard of Leoni's house. Indeed, Vasari was impressed enough to include This article was developed from a chapter in my doctoral dissertation, "Imperial Themes in the Sculpture of Leone Leoni," Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, i980, done under the supervision of Pro- fessor Irving Lavin, The Institute for Advanced Study.

Casa degli Omenoni, two lions attacking a satyr, detail of central section of the frieze (author). a description of the Casa degli Omenoni in the 1567 edition of the Vite. The passage is worth quoting at length: Leoni, in order to show the greatness of his spirit, the admirable talent which he had from nature, and fortune's favor, constructed at great cost and of most beautiful architecture, in the contrada de'Moroni, a house full of so many capricious inventions that there is perhaps nothing else like it in all of Milan. At the divisions of the facade there are, upon the pilasters, six prisoners, 61/2 braccia each, all carved from stone and be- tween them, in several niches made in imitation of the antique, are little terms, windows, and cornices very graceful and distinct from those normally used. All the parts below correspond with fine order to those above; the friezes are decorated with various instruments of the art of design. From the main door through a passageway one enters a courtyard where, in the center on four columns, is the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius formed in gesso from the original on the Campidoglio. By that statue Leoni wanted to signal that his house is dedicated to Marcus Aurelius. As to the prisoners, that fancy has been interpreted by different people in different ways. Beside that horse, as mentioned elsewhere, he has in his beautiful and very commodious house plaster casts of as many praiseworthy works of marble or bronze, modern or ancient, as he could procure.4 Leoni's desire to demonstrate his greatness of spirit was un- derstandable, but his decision to do so through the decoration of his own home-though not unprecedented in the i6th cen- tury-was, nonetheless, unusual. The impetus for the project must have been Leoni's successful sojourn at the court in Madrid where he completed a group of bronze portrait statues begun 15 years earlier and for which he was richly rewarded with 2,000 gold scudi.5 The renovation of the Casa degli Omenoni therefore occurred at a high point of Leoni's career. It was, however, a moment that had been a long time coming. Leoni had entered imperial service 24 years before, in 1542, as master of the mint in Milan,6 but it was not until late 1547 or early 1548 that opportunities for major sculptural commissions opened when he was invited to visit Emperor Charles V at the imperial court in Brussels in 4. Vasari-Milanesi, vII, 540-54I, author's translation. The Italian text reads: Il quale Lione, per mostrare la grandezza del suo animo, il bello ingegno che ha avuto dalla natura, ed il favore della fortuna, ha con molta spesa condotto di bellissima architettura un casotto nella con- trada de' Moroni, pieno in modo di capricciose invenzioni, che non n'&amp; forse un altro simile in tutto Milano. Nel partimento della facciata sono sopra a pilastri sei prigioni di braccia sei l'uno, tutti di pietra viva; e fra essi, in alcune nicchie fatte a imitazione degli antichi, con terminetti, finestre, e cornici tutte varie da quel che s'usa, e molto graziose; a tutte le parti di sotto corrispondono con bell' ordine a quelle di sopra; le fregiature sono tutte di vari strumenti dell'arte del disegno.

Oltre al qual cavallo, come in altro luogo s'e detto, ha in quella sua bella e comodissima abitazione formate di gesso quant'opere lodate di scultura o di getto ha potuto avere, o moderne o antiche. 5. Since the publication of Plon's monograph it has been assumed that Leoni never went to Spain. Plon showed convincingly that, contrary to the assertion of Caen Bermudez, Leoni did not accompany Charles V to Spain in i556; Plon, Leoni, 128ff. Moreover, Leoni did not heed Philip's directive to go to Spain issued on 20 January '559; Plon, Leoni, 14xff. However, Vasari reports: "Nel tornare Lione di Spagna se ne porto due mila scudi contanti, oltre a molti altri doni e favori che gli furono fatti in quella corte"; Vasari-Milanesi, vII, 538. As Vasari was Leoni's houseguest in May of 1566, there is every reason to believe his infor- mation is correct. 6.

Soon after the artist's arrival at the imperial court, Charles V and his sister Mary, regent of the Low Coun- tries, entrusted Leoni with a series of important commissions, his first sculptural projects. He appears to have been no less successful in winning the Emperor's personal favor. Charles installed the sculptor in a palace apartment directly below his own so that he could watch Leoni at work, and he delighted in conversing with him for hours.7 The depth of Charles's good will was such that on 2 November 1549 Leoni was made a noble and was knighted, honors not lightly bestowed on artists." The projects he was about to undertake and the favor he then enjoyed prompted Leoni to request from the Emperor the grant of a confiscated house in Milan located in the center of the city just north of the Duomo, a certain "casa del prato." The request must have been approved prior to Leoni's departure from Brus- sels late in 1549, because by i55o he had already set up his studio.9 No further references are known until a document of July 1565 in which Leoni petitioned the Senate of Milan to fix the house, which was then in a dangerous state of disrepair.1o It is from this period that the reconstruction must date, that is, between mid-1565 and 1566/1567- As it stands today, the facade of the Casa degli Omenoni remains essentially the same as it appeared in the i6th century. Comparisons with engravings of the facade in Lattuada's De- scrizione di Milano of 1738 and Marc Antonio dal Re's Palazzi Milanese of 1745 do reveal some modifications (Figs. I, 3, 4). Most noticeable is a third story above the cornice, a 19th-century addition. The ground floor remains unchanged with the excep- tion of the lateral niches, which have been made into windows. On the second story, seminude female herms that flanked the central portal as well as the framing pediment and stone bal- ustrade have been removed. In addition, the windows of the second and sixth bays have been made into doors opening onto narrow balconies with the consequent loss of the original mold- ings and pediments.1 The faqade belongs to the type initiated by Bramante's Palazzo Caprini in Rome-a rusticated ground floor serving as a base 7.

Neither of the engravings is completely accurate. Lattuada, De- scrizione di Milano, v, Milan, 1738, 443, implies that the prisoners are caryatids, simplifies the enframements of the blind windows on the piano nobile, and does not show the satyr falling out of the frieze. He also compresses the fagade unduly. Marc Antonio dal Re does not show the prisoners as caryatids but represents them nude with their arms folded across their chests so that they no longer appear as barbarians. He eliminated the rustication on the ground floor and erred in depicting the satyr in the frieze. He also elongated the proportions of the piano nobile.</page><page sequence="5">MEZZATESTA: FACADE OF LEONI'S CASA DEGLI OMENONI 237 ???-r r,,,,u cr-r-4- EM rd?X) IFI . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .~(llfy ~Ef=" ?--*rr*V ccc, rn P./ --un ru?- -?- , ~ c.---. ~ -,- -r ?- ?t ;~Z I_~5CI ~~~CI '?I-?* ,l,.?- ? _s ?. -:..i7p : Fig. 4.

Individual elements, of course, differ considerably, most notably, the recessed columns placed in narrow slots cut into the wall, the blind windows with spindle enframements, and the layering of the wall surface, all of which derive from the ricetto of Michelangelo's Laurentian Library.12 Leoni's only earlier architectural experience was the design of Giangiacomo de' Medici's tomb in the Duomo of Milan (1560- i563), 3 but he had obviously studied architecture in some detail. Vasari noted that Leoni devised niches, termini, windows, and cornices "tutte varie da quel che s'usa,"14 and, in fact, his de- tailing is quite distinctive, with sources ranging from the en- framements on the ancient Porta Borsari in Verona to the chi- merae on Galeazzo Alessi's Villa Cambiaso, Genoa (i548).15 Although Leoni selected his architectural vocabulary eclec- tically, the overall impression imparted by the facade is re- markable in its unity, order, and decorative restraint. Yet one 12. For the Laurentian Library, see James Ackerman, The Architecture of Michelangelo, London, 1961, 33-44, Figs. 16, 17, 18a. Leoni stopped in Florence in 156o on his way back to Milan from Rome. While there he certainly saw the Laurentian Library. 13. For which, see Plon, Leoni, I50ff. 14. See n. 4. 15. Vasari alludes to an antique source in his description, "e fra essi [the prisoners], in alcune nicchie fatta a imitazione degli antichi, sono terminetti, finestre, e cornici tutta varie da quel che s'usa, e motto graziose." This type was used earlier on the facade of the Palazzo Cancelleria in Rome, where Leoni also could have observed the refined use of rustication on the ground floor and the continuous zone artic- ulating the bases of the pilasters and windows of the piano nobile, a motif Leoni used on the facade and in the courtyard. The articulation of the courtyard niches seems to derive from the windows of the piano nobile on the Cancelleria.

Casa degli Omenoni, barbarian prisoner on the faCade (author). cannot escape the conclusion that, though much thought went into the architectural design, Leoni approached the task as a sculptor, for the most obvious features of the Casa degli Ome- noni are the six prisoners decorating the pilasters of the ground floor (Figs. 5-7, 10-12) and the two supporting figures flanking the entryway (Figs. 8, 9). The prisoners are identified by an inscription at the top of each pilaster reading, from the left: SVEVVS, QVADVS, ADIABENVS, PARTHVS, SARMATA, MARCOMANVS. Lomazzo reported in i585 that Antonio Abondio had carved the figures of the fagade,16 undoubtedly from models supplied by Leoni. They are powerfully expressive sculptures inspired by ancient Roman statues of barbarians and are among Leoni's most impressive achievements.17 Each prisoner is varied in the treat- ment of dress, physiognomic type, and placement of the hands, and each possesses a bulk which separately presents a potent -r?-~-~, v ~? c,?: f:kr?' ~i~2?E r-1, ~W ~24~ ;1; "p~ i r: ~ i; I Jlt , ~:~ %~be; t"~i ~~~ ~"~' i; a~ " e;? t.

These prisoners have frequently been called caryatids but, in fact, they do not possess any architectonic function. Their heads are positioned below the entablature and actually lean away from the wall surface. It has been noted that they represent a com- bination of Michelangelo's herms on the Julius Tomb and bar- barian prisoners of the type found on the Arch of Constantine."8 This is correct, although they neither grow organically out of the herm shaft at waist level, as do most herms, nor are they placed neatly atop the shaft as on the Julius Tomb. Rather, they overhang it, being brusquely truncated below the knees so that they appear suspended on the pilaster.19 In fact, the captives may be read as "applied herms," for the tapered herm shaft overlays the Doric pilaster, its base literally embedded in the pilaster's base molding (e.g., Fig. 5)- i6.

Milan, and their debut must have been particularly impressive and effective in calling attention to the palace's owner and ar- chitect.2z This example may well have influenced Leoni.22 How- ever, his response was very different. Both Alessi's and Seregni's herms are only "herm heads"; they are smaller in scale, function architectonically, and have a subordinate position within the overall decorative program. Leoni created a dramatic new type: monumental, three-quarter-length, nontectonic barbarian herms that were the focus of the facade. The half-length, nude male figures that flank the doorway are also novel (see Figs. 8, 9). They may also relate generally to Michelangelo's herms on the Julius Tomb, but Leoni en- larged, undressed, and moved them out from the wall so that they sit on a small platform supported by a corbel decorated with a lion's head, an emblem of the artist. In placing these 20. Johnson, "Herms," 30ff. See this study on the use of herms in the i6th century. The first tectonic use of herms in a Renaissance villa was by Giulio Romano in the courtyard of the Grotta of the Palazzo del TU (c. 1530) and later at the Villa Giulia where they articulate the area around the loggia and nympheum. Even as late as the 1570s the use of herms was limited to only a few villas in and around Rome. In Lombardy, however, they proliferated largely through the influence of Alessi and Tibaldi; see Johnson, "Herms," 28-34. Leoni undoubtedly knew the colossal Pan caryatids that decorated the garden facade of the loggia of the Casino of Pius IV, for work was far advanced by 1560; see Graham Smith, The Casino ofPius IV, Prince- ton, 1977, ioff. The Palazzo di Giustizia in Mantua is decorated with 12 giant triton- head herms on the upper story. This palace, long attributed to Giulio Romano, is now dated to the x7th century and is given to Anton Maria Viani. For the current bibliography, see G.

Unlike these women and Michelangelo's herms, who carry the entablature on their heads, Leoni's men are bent forward, wearily supporting the balcony's weight on the upper back. The prisoners on the facade of the Casa degli Omenoni were bound to attract attention, especially in Milan where the facades of patrician houses were, for the most part, simple and un- adorned.24 Only Bramante's Casa Fontana (late 149os), with its four monumental frescoed fictive bronze statues on the second i-i ~d~ I :? ~ ""i;; ~~i"'~-? i;i' ~-~~??- -il ?a c- ik~" ?:P_- I;YHC'~?;?-' i " :2:S Fig. io.

From the late Middle Ages, stucco, or graffito, was employed to cover facades with incised ornamental geo- metric patterns. At the beginning of the 16th century, there arose a new tendency toward figural compositions based on antique artistic and literary sources which quickly superseded the decorative geometric motifs of the earlier period.26 23. Northern triumphal arches also appear to have been the source for the strange creatures flanking the Nativity relief on the tomb of Giangiacomo de' Medici in the Cathedral of Milan; see Plon, Leoni, 150. 24. From 1466 private palaces were erected that incorporated the latest architectural forms and utilized a greater degree of decoration on the fagade, though nothing so elaborate as the Casa degli Omenoni.

This development was characterized by two major trends: the frescoed facade decorated with military scenes inspired by clas- sical authors and painted in imitation of ancient sculpture, a type popularized by Polidoro da Caravaggio in Rome in the early 520os (Fig. I4); and facades decorated with all'antica sculp- ture in stucco or stone, such as Sanmicheli's Palazzo Bevilacqua in Verona, which is embellished with busts of Roman emperors on the keystones and winged victories in the spandrels (1530s; Fig. 15). Although differing in their individual characteristics, these facade types are united by their return to ancient art as a source; by their frequent intention to re-create an ancient edifice in terms of ornament and/or structure; and by the classical subject matter of the decorations, which invariably refers to the concept of ancient Roman virtus with the suggestion that it was an attribute of the owner of the house.27 Indeed, it is this latter aspect of the facades that is perhaps most significant, for the I 9? i. r 1 I d. ?u; ?? r r.r~a~iP~gC~ tlJ-~ ~~2*1 ldr rm t ;k j:I :% I 1: ' ~? *i?

The new intellectual criteria of Renaissance society placed a premium on the moral examples supplied by the virtuous ancients. For those who had the re- sources, the decoration of their houses' facades was both an aesthetic choice and a social statement, a declaration placing the owner in the forefront of the revival of Roman virtus. Leoni, of course, was well aware of the artistic and social prestige associated with the antique. In Rome in i56o he dem- onstrated his intense interest in ancient art by obtaining Pope Paul IV's permission to make plaster casts of several important ancient statues, among them the Capitoline equestrian portrait of Marcus Aurelius; at great expense he had the statues labo- riously transported by mule to Milan.28 Whether Leoni had already been contemplating the restoration of his house at this point is unknown. But, as we have seen, within a few years the Marcus Aurelius statue had not only been installed as the cen- 27.

Gregorius related in the Narracio de mirabilibus urbis that the statue originally was set on four gilt bronze columns before the altar of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill.31 Leoni's allusion to this arrangement undoubtedly won admiration for its archaeological accuracy.

They exist as proof of the greatness of the Emperor and the grandeur of empire, past and present. The connections between the Roman Empire and the Holy Roman Empire were well known and were a popular equation in the Emperor Charles V's imperial panegyrics. Leoni, as im- perial sculptor knighted by Charles V, naturally occupied a place in that equation. The prisoners on the facade, the plaster cast of Marcus Aurelius in the courtyard, and the dedication of the house were public statements which not only proclaimed Leoni's present imperial ties but also garnered the prestige associated with the monuments and glory of ancient Rome. These facts alone, however, neither fully account for the dedication nor do they explain all the implications and visual ramifications of the program. The questions remain why Leoni chose to dedicate the Casa degli Omenoni to Marcus Aurelius, why he selected barbarian prisoners to decorate the facade, and what is the complete nature of the program. Marcus Aurelius is perhaps best known as the philosopher- emperor and author of the Meditations, the popular collection of philosophic apothegms on the Stoic way of life. However, the appeal of the Meditations may be traced less to the i6th than to the I7th century. In fact, in the cinquecento, Marcus Aure- lius's renown was primarily the result of one man, the court historiographer of Charles V, Fray Antonio de Guevara (1480?- I545).33 Guevara wrote and dedicated to Charles V two books: the Libro Aureo de Marco Aurelio and the Relox de Principes. The former appeared in 1528 and purported to be a translation of the Greek manuscript of the Meditations. In fact, it is a more or less imaginary biography based on Julius Capitolinus's Historia Augusta. The Libro Aureo reviews the Emperor's entire life with special attention devoted to his outstanding virtues, especially his sense of justice and clemency and his continual concern for the well-being of the state. The book was conceived in the tradition of the Speculum Principum (Mirror for Princes), edu- cative tracts designed to produce good rulers, but it also pre- sented a richly drawn portrait of Marcus Aurelius not only as an emperor but also as a man with personal problems, a fact that contributed to the book's popularity.34 The Relox de Principes is three times as long as the Libro Aureo but actually incorporates almost all of its chapters into a con- siderable body of new material. Like the Libro Aureo, the Relox is a moral, didactic treatise in the tradition of the Mirror for Princes. The book is a comprehensive presentation of Guevara's political ideals wherein Marcus Aurelius is held up as an example for any man who aspires to a virtuous Christian life.35 Both books were enormously popular throughout Europe during the i6th century. In Italy alone from 1542 to i6oo, an edition of the Libro Aureo or the Relox was published at a rate 32. None of the early sources identifies the barbarians as anything other than prisoners. Plon records the inscriptions but does not discuss them further. Nebbia in La casa degli Omenoni in Milano, 9, 21ff., refers to the captives only as tribes once dominated by Rome. Johnson in "Herms" connects only the Quadi and Samarti with Marcus Aurelius. Pope-Hennessy appears to have been the first scholar to link all six prisoners with tribes subdued by the Emperor; see High Renaissance, 86. In fact, five are mentioned in the most famous ancient biography of Marcus Aurelius, Julius Capitolinus's life of the Emperor in the Historia Augusta, an edition of which, edited by Erasmus, appeared in 1518: the Suebi, Quadi, Samarti, Marcomani (all Germanic tribes), and the Par- thians. The Adiabeni were vassals of the Parthian kingdom and as such were almost always involved in its wars with Rome. The tribe is men- tioned in Julius Capitolinus's life of Septimus Severus in relation to his Parthian wars and Leoni may have made the connection here. 33.

Daniele da Barbaro, reconstruction of the Persian Portico. En- graving from da Barbaro's 1556 edition of Vitruvius's De architectura (Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, The University of Texas at Austin). equivalent to one almost every i8 months.36 The vast diffusion of these works is a measure of the wide appeal of Guevara's political-moral treatises. The Libro Aureo and the Relox de Principes gave a new di- mension to the personality of Marcus Aurelius, popularizing the Emperor as the ideal prince. As the best of all the pagan Roman emperors he represented the supreme example of ancient virtus. His life and writings provided an elevated standard of com- portment not only for the ruler but also for all men who sought to lead a Christian life. It seems likely that the Casa degli Omenoni stands as an example of that new popularity, for in dedicating his house to Marcus Aurelius, Leoni probably referred to the image of Marcus Aurelius popularized by Guevara. In so doing, he associated himself with this most virtuous of ancient emperors. At the same time, because both books were dedicated to Charles V and because of Leoni's position as imperial sculptor, the artist en- joyed a second flattering association. Leoni's public profession of a personal code of honor and virtue must have been imme- diately recognizable and highly esteemed among the nobility of Milan. The dedication to Marcus Aurelius was also reflected by the barbarian prisoners on the facade, tribes vanquished by the Em- peror.37 The captives formed the prelude to the equestrian cen- terpiece and established the public tenor of the program. Bar- barian prisoners had appeared earlier on the frescoed palace faqades of Polidoro da Caravaggio. However, they usually stood alone, or when grouped were placed in pairs before a trophaeum, as on the facade of the house at Piazza dei Caprettari (see Fig. 14).38 Their use on the Casa degli Omenoni recalled the trium- phal monuments of ancient Rome, such as the Arch of Con- stantine, where four prisoners stood in series in the attic zone of each face. But Leoni seems to have been inspired by a different source, Daniele da Barbaro's 1556 illustrated edition of Vitru- vius's De architectura.39 The text described the Persian Portico erected by the Lacedaemonians after their victory over the Per- sians: "in quel portico posero i simularchi de i prigioni con l'ornamento Barbaro del vestire, che sostenevano il tetto."40 The accompanying engraving shows a portion of the portico with two caryatids of the familiar Roman type (Fig. 16). The typo- logical relationship to Leoni's prisoners is evident (cf. Fig. i). Although he eliminated their supportive role, Leoni also joined his captives to the building, unlike the prisoners of the Arch of Constantine who stand before the architecture. In addition, when barbarian statues were used on triumphal arches they usually decorated the attic zone. Similarly, when frescoed bar- barians or herms appeared on palace faqades, as at Palazzo Marino 36. For a listing of the Italian editions, see P. Lino G. Canedo, "Las Obras de Fr.

Anonymous, court ball in the great hall at Binche, c. 1545 (courtesy of Christie, Manson and Woods Ltd.). or Palazzo dei Giureconsulti in Milan, they were restricted to the upper stories. This reflected a tendency of Italian palace decoration that viewed the second story as the place to receive figural decoration. By arranging his series of prisoners on the ground floor and by presenting them on a monumental scale, Leoni introduced a new pattern of sculptural disposition, one which derived directly from the Persian Portico. But the Persian Portico does not account for the most re- markable aspect of Leoni's prisoners: their brutal amputation below the knees. This fragmentary quality and the fact that they seem to be suspended on their shafts recall the classical tro- phaeum, the battlefield trophy wherein the spoils of war- breastplates, weapons, helmets, and shields-were hung on lances as an anthropomorphic emblem of the vanquished, a symbol of victory. This type had been adopted earlier by Renaissance artists in palace decoration, though on a much smaller scale and as frescoed or stuccoed elements within a larger decorative whole. The monumental size and trophaic quality set Leoni's men apart and suggest one source in particular. Jacques DuBroeucq, the architect of Mary Queen of Hungary's palace at Binche, intro- duced trophies on the window wall of the great hall (c. 1545).4 In an anonymous drawing of the x6th century, trophaeums composed of a cuirass, shields, swords, and a helmet with a mask-like face are visible flanking each window (Fig. r7). DuBroeucq's trophies differ significantly from earlier Renais- sance examples. They were isolated from the overall decorative 41. The palace at Binche was built under DuBroeucq between i545 and 1549.

Leoni, who visited Binche late in 1549, must have been in- fluenced by these unusual herms, particularly their dominant setting, serial arrangement, huge scale, and fragmentary form. In fact, Leoni combined these elements and their placement on herm shafts with the barbarian prisoner type of Vitruvius's Per- sian Portico, although eliminating the latter's supportive role. In so doing he created a new type: monumental, living, non- tectonic, barbarian herm-trophaeums. Through the form of the barbarian-trophaeums and their relationship to the Persian Portico, Leoni conveyed a message. As Vitruvius wrote, the Persian Portico was erected with the spoils of victory and stood as a symbol "of the honor and of the virtue of the citizens"; the barbarians represented "pride casti- gated" and a warning "that enemies might have reason to fear the effects of their [the Greeks'] strength."42 As the Persian prisoners were a public expression of the "virtu" and the "glo- ria" of the Greeks, so the captives on the Casa degli Omenoni expressed the virtue and glory of Leoni no less than a mute warning to his enemies. The downcast glances and pathetic expressions of the vanquished barbarians signal their absolute defeat, a defeat mandated by the superior "virtu" of their ad- versary. Similarly, the half-length caryatids flanking the central portal, with their links to triumphal arches, were equally effec- tive in establishing a triumphant tone (see Figs. 8, 9, 13). That Leoni chose a military metaphor for the program is itself highly revealing. One cannot help but sense in the martial and admonitory tone of the facade a reflection of Leoni's view of life as a continuous battle.43 Indeed, throughout his career, Leoni was readily prone to violence, his outbursts fueled by a chronic insecurity engendered by the poverty of his youth. Leoni's life is marked by numerous conflicts, the earliest of which can be traced to 1536 when, while working in the mint at Ferrara, he was accused of counterfeiting and was forced to flee and to seek the protection of his influential relative Pietro Aretino. Two years later, Leoni was in Rome serving at the Papal Court where he and Benvenuto Cellini developed into bitter enemies, their animosity finally exploding in a public shouting match in the Camera Apostolica. The grudge reached a climax when Leoni unsuccessfully attempted to poison Cellini while the latter was imprisoned in the Castel Sant'Angelo. New charges of coun- terfeiting leveled against Leoni in 1540 by the papal jeweler Pellegrino di Leuti resulted in Leoni attacking and horribly disfiguring the man with a dagger, an attack for which he was sentenced to have his right hand cut off. Only the last-minute intervention of powerful friends spared Leoni, although the new sentence might have been considered even worse: an indefinite period chained to an oar as a galley slave in the papal fleet. Even after he was released and had established himself in Milan, Leoni remained defensive and belligerent, hiring an assassin in 1545 to kill an assistant who refused to return with him from Venice. Yet, perhaps even more shocking was the knife attack in 1559 on his house guest, Orazio Vecelli, the son of his close friend Titian. The violent and sudden assault occurred at dinner and seems to have been motivated by anger over Orazio's contacts with Leoni's Milanese clients. In his willingness to resort to the sword, Leoni revealed a temperament jealous of personal gain, one that was ready to defend honor and privilege against any threat, real or imagined.44 Yet in choosing captive barbarians, Leoni signaled that the battle was over, the enemy defeated and humbled, with peace and art reigning within his house. In a sense, Leoni's personal struggle for security and recognition was over. From poverty and a term as a galley slave, he had been knighted by the Holy Roman Emperor, given a home, and been publicly associated with the greatest emperors of ancient and modern times, Marcus Aurelius and Charles V. The Casa degli Omenoni thus stood as a kind of templum virtutis. Leoni had created his own Persian Portico in Milan. One more feature of the Casa degli Omenoni's facade remains to be considered: the frieze decorating the second story (Figs. 2, 18). In the center, Leoni had carved two lions attacking a satyr who falls backward out of the relief plane, his head dan- gling in the pediment of the window below, his left arm des- perately clutching the entablature (see Fig. 2). The lions, epon- ymous emblems of Leone Leoni, attack the satyr, a beast at once evil and vicious. The concept alludes to the triumph of virtue over vice, a familiar theme in Renaissance art and literature. Here virtue's victory takes on a chilling finality as the attack upon the satyr's genitals is not simply a horrible punishment but the ultimate defense against the satyr's procreation of ma- licious progeny.45 Antonio de Guevara claimed that the greatest thief was one who robbed a man's reputation, for "a reputation attacked is forever sullied."46 The relief thus stands as a dreadful warning, a cave leonem, to those who might consider such a felony. Leoni may have had a specific prototype in mind when he designed the satyr relief. In Filarete's Treatise on Architecture (x461-1464), the facade of the magnificent palace of the pseu- donymous architect Onitoan Noliaver was decorated with a relief over the main portal showing the allegorical figure of 42.

As the lion is a symbol of virtue, he referred to virtue's victory over vice (satyr), and he replaced the bust of Onitoan Noliaver with a punning self-reference based on his personal emblems.

Leone Leoni's coat of arms appearing in his grant of nobility and knighthood (Archivio Storico dell'Arte, 2, fasc. 1I [1889], 81). But the influence of Filarete's idea extends beyond a mere quotation. It embraces the notion that both artists were abun- dantly endowed with virtue, a fact that permitted the construc- tion of such palatial residences and which in turn signaled the exalted status of the artist.49 Like Onitoan Noliaver's palace, the Casa degli Omenoni was a triumphal edifice, a true House of Virtue. The program continues along the frieze to the left and right. In the first, third, fifth, and seventh bays Leoni depicted eagles flanking the chimerae and a lion with its paw atop a wheel or globe. In the second and sixth bays an eagle supports garlands (see Fig. x8). The lions, wheel, and eagles derive from Leoni's coat of arms granted by Charles V in 1549 with the diploma of nobility and knighthood (Fig. 19).50 Leoni paid homage to the 47. The idea of virtue was central in Filarete's treatise. It was also a major iconographical innovation representing the first time in the Ren- aissance that Virtus was represented by a single allegorical figure, a fact of which Filarete was particularly proud; see Filarete's Treatise on Ar- chitecture. Being the Treatise by Antonio di Piero Averlino, known as Filarete, trans. with an introduction and notes by John R. Spencer, 2 vols., New Haven and London, 1965, I, 246-247, n. i. The figure appeared first at the summit of the Temple of Virtue. It also appeared three more times: on the House of Virtue where it was placed above the Gate of Virtue; atop the Theatre of Virtue; and on the fagade of Onitoan Noliaver's palace; Spencer, Filarete's Treatise, , 246ff. The faCade is described in the following manner: "Its forward faCade looked like this. Those on the sides followed the same order. There were many ornaments on the faqade. Among others over the door was Virtue with Vice beneath it just as they were depicted in their own house. This was permitted him only because he had invented this figure of virtue. His portrait bust was carved there with his name written below it together with other words that related the content of these two verses: how he built the house, the Theatre of Virtue, and how he had been the inventor of the two figures carved here." Vice was also depicted on Filarete's House of Virtue above the Porta Chachia as Virtue's counterpart in the form of a nude satyr seated on the rim of a wheel; Spencer, Filarete's Treatise, 246. 48. Vasari was familiar with Filarete's Trattato for he made extensive use of it in the Lives. It seems likely that Leoni also would have known the text either from the original version (now lost) or through the manuscript in the Sforza collection. This example appears always to have been in Milan. It was destroyed during World War II; Spencer, Filarete's Treatise, xvii. 49. Vasari, in a letter written from Milan on 9 May 1566 to Vincenzo Borghini, commented: "Mess. Leone ... ci ha fatto e fa cose che se Michelagnolo resuscitassi e vedessi come si vive diria che l'arte l'ha fatto tener si raro, fussi diventata un'altra, perche nel vero questi maestri non sono pid filosofi ma principi ..."; Vasari-Milanesi, viii, 405. 5o.

Rolling the wheel would only hasten the moment when Leoni would be cast down from his favored position. Medieval and Renaissance illustrations of Fortune turning her wheel clearly depict the neverending game she plays as the favored fall to be replaced by someone new.53 In the frieze of the Casa degli Omenoni the lion stops the wheel of Fortune and the movement of Fortuna's globe just as the lions on Leoni's stemma hold it immobile (see Fig. i8). The facade of the Casa degli Omenoni was expensive and permanent and, as such, was a declaration of social, political, and economic security and self-confidence. The mere fact that Leoni had created so lavish a facade was proof of his triumph over Fortune. In placing its paw on the wheel, the lion-virtue in the frieze of the Casa degli Omenoni has overcome Fortune's vicissitudes, arresting its circular course at this the moment of Leoni's greatest personal glory. The facade of the Casa degli Omenoni provided the passing pedestrian ample evidence of Leoni's success. Were this observer to walk into the cortile, he would see yet other indications, more personal in tone, of Leoni's character. The courtyard pro- vided the setting for the plaster cast of the Marcus Aurelius statue as well as for a plaster cast of Michelangelo's Pietd in St. Peter's and casts of other unidentified statues which were dis- played under the arcade and in niches on the piano nobile. 54 These plasters created a private gallery of the most famous monuments of art, works available for the appreciation and study of Leoni's friends and students.56 This in itself was a novelty, for never before had an artist gone to the trouble and expense of assem- bling and displaying such a series of plaster casts for his own use.56 These casts together with Leoni's famous art collection, which included works by Michelangelo, Leonardo, Titian, Cor- reggio, Tintoretto, and Parmigianino, among others, formed a collection hailed in 1619 as the first private gallery in Milan.57 His gallery rivaled, if it did not surpass, those of many Italian nobles, obtaining for Leoni prestige usually reserved for the aristocracy.58 The cortile was adorned also with a series of decorated met- opes of which only ten have survived. They represent various attributes of the arts, including sculpture, goldsmithwork, ar- chitecture, and music, as well as other more enigmatic emblems referring, perhaps, to artistic inspiration and fortune.59 Togeth- er, these metopes allude to the world of the arts and the factors essential for its sustenance and prosperity.60 The acquisition of a home in the center of Milan and its subsequent lavish decoration were significant accomplishments for a man who only a few years earlier had been chained to an oar in a papal galley. Leoni's achievements were made possible by his success as an artist. It is, therefore, interesting to compare briefly the Casa degli Omenoni to other artists' homes in the i6th century.61 In almost every case where the artist-owner 51.

Doren, "Fortuna im Mittelalter und der Renaissance," Vortriige der Bibliothek Warburg, I (1922-1923), 71-144, esp. 84ff. It was Petrarch who revived the classical concept of virtue as an answer to the unpredictability of Fortune; see R. Wittkower, "Chance, Time, and Virtue,"Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, I (1937-1938), 3x6. The opposition of Virtue and Fortune was a favorite Renaissance theme, one that penetrated all levels of society, a point discussed by G. Paparelli, "Virtui e Fortuna dal Medio Evo al Machiavelli," Da Dante al Seicento, Salerno, 1977, 116. Numerous examples of the theme may be found in the x5th and x6th centuries. Leoni himself developed the idea on the reverse of a medal for Bernardo Spina which depicts Virtue mounted on horseback trampling a recumbent Fortuna with the motto: SVPERAT OMNIA VIRTVS. Vasari utilized a similar program for a painted ceiling in his house at Arezzo. Here Virtue subdues Envy as she seizes Fortune by the forelock, thereby controlling her uncertain course; Wittkower, "Chance," 320ff. 54. Vasari referred to Leoni's collection of plaster casts noting that he had "formate di gesso quant'opera lodate di scultura o di moderne o antiche"; Vasari-Milanesi, vIII, 541. As noted above, Leoni made the cast of the Marcus Aurelius while in Rome in 1560, and according to Malespini he made a cast of Michelangelo's Minerva Christ "et altre diverse rare et maravigliose antichiti"; C. Malespini, Ducento Novelle, 228ff. Carlo Torre, in II Ritratto di Milano, 276, noted the placement of Michelangelo's Pietd in the courtyard, and Lomazzo, Trattato, III, 84, recorded the cast of an antique Venus. The Pietd and a cast of the Laocoin were donated to the Ambrosiana by one of Leoni's heirs and can still be seen today on the first landing of the main staircase. For a fuller discussion of the plaster casts, see Mezzatesta, "Imperial Themes," 237ff. 55. Vasari commented on the collection's value for study; Vasari- Milanesi, vi, 1o7. 56. The use of plaster casts by artists was, of course, not unprece- dented. During the mid-i5th century Squarcione is reported to have assembled casts of ancient statues and reliefs (Vasari-Milanesi, III, 385), while Bandinelli is known to have had casts in his "academy." It would appear, however, that private collectors formed the most important prototype for Leoni. By the i6th century, collectors such as Cardinal Ludovico Gonzaga and Mario Benavides had begun to add casts to their collection of ancient sculpture; see B. Candida, I calchi rinascimentali, Padua, 1967, 66. More recently, Leoni had the example of Primaticcio, who took casts of many of Rome's most famous ancient statues in 1540 for FranCois I. Leoni attempted to purchase these molds while in Paris in 1549 for Mary Queen of Hungary and later for Ferrante Gonzaga; see Plon, Leoni, 49. 57. Morigia, La Nobiltd di Milano, with preface by Girolamo Borsieri, Milan, 16x9, 67. 58. Leoni's art collection is the subject of a future study. For a brief discussion and references, see Mezzatesta, "Imperial Themes," 237-242. 59. The courtyard metopes were described by Lomazzo as "istro- menti dell'arte sua, come staffe, martelli, vasi, sigilli, stecchi, e simili, il che pub servir per esempio di quanto sopra questo potrei dire"; Trattato, II, 333. 60. See Mezzatesta, "Imperial Themes," 2x8, for further discussion and illustrations. 61. On this topic, see most recently the dissertation by Nikki Leopold, "The Artist's House in the Sixteenth Century."</page><page sequence="17">MEZZATESTA: FACADE OF LEONI'S CASA DEGLI OMENONI 249 decorated the faqade-Giorgione's house in Venice, Giulio Ro- mano's Casa Pippo in Mantua, and the projected faCade of Va- sari's house in Arezzo-reference was made to the arts and to the owner's status as artist.62 The fact that Leoni's profession is proclaimed only in the courtyard is significant. Leoni's public personality, as defined on the facade, transcended the role of artist to become the equal of the aristocracy. At the Casa degli Omenoni he finally attained the status of nobility, a rank granted him i6 years earlier. That Leoni achieved his success as a result of his art is undeniable, but it is discernible only in the courtyard. The sources, program, and decoration of the Casa degli Ome- noni demonstrated to the cognoscenti the wide range of his talent and intellect while proclaiming to the world his position as a gentleman in the social world of the Hapsburg imperium. 62. All these examples are discussed in Mezzatesta, "Imperial Themes," 233ff. A notable exception is the facade that Lelio Orsi designed for his house in Reggio Emilia; see Detlef Heikamp, "Florence la maison de Vasari," L'Oeil, 137 (1966), 42.</page></plain_text>
