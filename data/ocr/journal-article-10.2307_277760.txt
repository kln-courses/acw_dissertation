<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS by W. E. Pritchard and others, features a fine, compre- hensive description of extant flora and fauna found in the vicinity of the rockshelter as well as remains from the site itself. Finally, there is an article on the method of using soil pH measurements as an aid in planning excavation, which should be of interest to all archaeologists. David Weide describes the test application of this method at several sites in southern California where it proved val- uable in locating buried structures, concentrations of burials, and maximum midden accumulations. This con- tribution is perhaps the best in the volume. LAURENCE W. SPANNE University of California Santa Barbara, California America's First Civilization: Discovering the Olmec. MICHAEL D. COE. American Heritage Publishing Co., The Smithsonian Library, New York, 1968. 159 pp., 91 illus., appendix, index. $4.95. The jacket states the book is "written and edited for the intelligent layman," yet many of the data in this popularly written account of Olmec studies are newer and fresher than material appearing in the present text- books on Mesoamerica. Written for a popular audience, the presentation at times tends to be oversimplified. How- ever, the book is an interesting coverage of the various facets of Olmec archaeology and its interpretation. The introductory chapters give a historical background to Mesoamerican archaeology, stressing in particular the Archaic and Formative periods; MacNeish's Tehuacan Val'ey data are presented to acquaint the reader with plant domestication, while the origins of settled village life are explained through Coe's work at La Victoria and the Coe-Flannery hypothesis of microenvironments. This latter point should draw a moan from those of the "highland school." A chapter is devoted to pioneering contributions in Olmec studies by men such as Blom and La Farge, Vaillant, and Stirling, and this is followed by entire chapters covering the archaeological history of the two major lowland Olmec sites, La Venta and San Lo- renzo. The La Venta chapter describes the archaeological situation at the site, the work of Stirling, the early theories of Caso and Covarrubias, and the investigations of Heizer and Drucker. In addition, it presents a compilation of recently published data, including William's identifica- tion of the source of basalt used at La Venta, and Heizer's recent description of the pyramid at La Venta as "fluted," possibly an Olmec imitation of a cinder cone volcano. The site of San Lorenzo, which has been under in- vestigation by Michael Coe over the past several field seasons, is discussed primarily in relationship to this recent work. Coe includes not only scientific observa- tions, but he offers a number of brief anecdotes on the excavations and the discovery of new monuments. Most archaeologists are probably unaware that the recent San Lorenzo project also investigated the human ecology of that zone. Preliminary observations from those investi- gations are presented in this book for their first time in print and, while necessarily brief and superficial, they provide a valuable update to Heizer's 1960 article on the agricultural potential of the La Venta zone. The chap- ters on La Venta and San Lorenzo are well illustrated and include portions of new topographic maps from both these key sites. Coe devotes the second half of the book to a dis- cussion of the many theories and problems surrounding Olmec studies. He has never been known to fear pre- senting controversial new theories, and the latter chapters provide him with the opportunity to compile and inter- pret new data. The Olmec presence in central Mexico, which he indirectly links to the development of irriga- tion in the central highlands, is attributed primarily to the Olmec quest for jade, around 1000 B.C. This date for Olmec expansion into the highlands is quite rea- sonable in view of Tolstoy's new data (mentioned by Coe) from Tlapacoya, which indicates that the Olmec levels there are pre-El Arbolillo and at the moment are the earliest known Formative levels in the Valley of Mex- ico. As a proponent of the "trade route" theory for Olmec expansion, I am in general agreement with Coe's interpretation of the data. His mention of the region around Arcelia, Guerrero, as a possible source of OImnec jade is quite interesting as an Olmec stela was recently discovered near Arcelia. Coe presents a series of conjectures about Olmec so- ciety utilizing his new data on human ecology from San Lorenzo. He argues against the idea of an Olmec theoc- racy or a chiefdom and in favor of an Olmec state that formed Mesoamerica's first political empire. Equally stim- ulating is his discussion of the iconography of Olmec religion. Whereas Covarrubias suggested that the Olmec werejaguar evolved into the various rain god motifs of later Mesoamerican civilizations, Coe feels that the baby. face werejaguar motif belongs to a number of Olmec deities, all possessing the werejaguar form. In addition to identifying an Olmec rain god, he identifies a maize god, Xipe, death god, fire god, and feathered serpent god, all of which were important deities to later Mesoameri- can civilizations. The text ends with a discussion of Olmec origins and the legacy left by Olmec. For origins, Sahaguin's discus- sion of the legendary Tamoanchan is used, and Tamoan- chan is identified by Coe as the Gulf Coast Olmec heartland. Using the present-day distribution of Mayan languages, and evidence from glottochronology, he feels that the language of Tamoanchan, and thus the language of the Olmecs, was an ancestral Mayan. His discus- sion of the contribution of Olmec culture to the great Classic civilizations is perhaps conservative. As new data continue to be compiled, there is little doubt that Olmec innovations were strongly influential in shaping Mesoamerican culture. While acknowledging that Teoti. huacan architecture apparently has non-Olmec roots, Coe points out that gods of Teotihuacan "were born in the Olmec heartland." He partially attributes Teotihua- cain dominance during the Early Classic to their control of chinampa agriculture. Here I am in disagreement with the author, for recent archaeological investigation by 495</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Armillas appears to indicate that chinampas are a post- Teotihuacafn innovation. The book concludes with an appendix consisting of a number of short excerpts from the writings of Sahagun, Cortez, Stevens, Caso, Stirling, and MacNeish. These passages are followed by eight interesting pages of sketches, by Covarrubias, of Olmec archaeological pieces, ending with his satirical cartoon and verse on the rela- tionship of Olmec to Maya. The major drawback to the book is not the fault of the author: the book was edited for a popular market, and it lacks bibliographic citations. An archaeologist with- out a background in Olmec studies, or students doing research on the Olmec and interested in further pur- suing the new data, will probably be frustrated by this lack. In addition, the only bibliography is a small list of recommended readings, the majority of which do not directly pertain to the textual material. Although the book is a "popular" offering, it discusses and synthesizes a great deal of material. The author's unquestionable expertise in the field of Olmec prehis- tory, his easily readable presentation of the material, to- gether with the numerous anecdotes, excellent illustra- tions, and new theories and data (although uncited), will make this book of interest to anyone with a desire to know more about the New World's first civiliza- tion, the Olmec. DAVID C. GROVE State University of New York Binghamton, New York Orfebreria Prehispanica de Colombia: Estilos Quimbaya y Otros. JOSE PEREZ DE BARRADAS. Banco de la Repuib- lica (Bogota, Colombia), Madrid, 1966. xxiii + 377 pp., 113 figs., 310 pls., 30 tables, index. 2 vols. No price given. These two volumes are somewhat late in being re- viewed. However, they should be brought to the atten- tion of archaeologists interested in the development of New World metallurgy, since they represent the culmi- nation of a significant six-volume series on the prehistoric goldwork of Colombia. The volumes being reviewed, like their predecessors by the same author, are primarily based on the more than 10,000 examples of prehistoric metalwork housed in the Museo del Oro del Banco de la Repiiblica of Bogota, Colombia. In addition, items that have been published from other collections are also taken into consideration. These two volumes constitute the report on the analy- sis of the Quimbaya, Darien, Popayan, Sinu, Invasion- ista, and Tairona styles of pre-Columbian metalwork. The text begins with an outline of previous research on the goldwork of the Cauca and Sinfu valleys. Each gold style is considered in a separate section of the text, which is illustrated with line drawings and plates in addition to the many examples of each style pre- sented in the second volume in the form of plates. Each section of the text is composed of a descriptive study, a technological study, a typological description, and a sec- tion on the chronology and relationships of the style under consideration with Colombian and foreign gold styles. The conclusions attempt to place some order into the subject of technological development and abso- lute chronology. Mechanical errors have been kept to a minimum. The large size of these books, 31.5 cm. x 24.5 cm, as well as the subject matter, is reminiscent of the many art books in which pre-Columbian metallurgy is one of the subjects considered. However, Perez de Barradas has con- ducted a rigorous scientific study. He has refined, en- larged, and illustrated the preliminary framework of C. R. Margain (1951, Estudio inicial de las colleciones del Mu- seo del Oro del Banco de la Reputblica. Banco de la Re- puiblica, Bogota) and has given it meaning. The greatest contribution of this study is the classi- fication system that is developed and applied to a large body of data that was simply a large body of unclassified pre-Columbian art prior to this and the preceding works of Perez de Barradas. The styles into which the samples are classified are not rigid narrow categories but, instead, are broad groupings of related samples. Bibliographic sources are given for previously studied samples and, if consulted, illustrate the previous confusion on the clas- sification of Colombian goldwork. Stylistic distinctions are very clear for the anthropomorphic figures except for a few samples that share features of more than one style and which would be difficult to place in any particular style without some reservations. However, the typologies established for zoomorphic figures and jewelry are not as clear, with the major portion of the jewelry being rele- gated to the Invasionista style. Because of the lack of data on provenience for most of the samples used, it is not possible to tell if the differences within a style are due to spatial or temporal factors. Each sample is de- scribed to a greater or lesser extent depending on its complexity. The weight, height, and width of each sam- ple is given in the text, and a four-category chemical analysis (gold, silver, copper ,and other metals and im- purities) is provided for some of the items. The section devoted to chronological aspects is weak, but this results from poorly documented data and is not a reflection of the author's abilities. Although the asso- ciations of many items used by Perez de Barradas are not known, he quotes extensively from the rare reports of treasure hunters when there are any clues which might aid in chronological analysis. This lack of data on proveni- ence prohibits a thorough chronological study based on either relative or absolute dating. Jos6 Perez de Barradas is to be congratulated for the high standards of scholarship maintained in this study, and the Banco de la Repfublica has set an excellent ex- ample by undertaking the financial and administrative burden of publishing these data in such a usable form. Future studies may result in changing some of the clas- sifications made by Perez de Barradas and could possibly show that some of his conclusions on the relationships between styles and dating are incorrect.
