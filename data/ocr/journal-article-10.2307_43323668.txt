Abstract: Cultural traditions encompass specific modes of visuality. Islamic and Hindu ways of seeing are described in terms of their inscription upon the cultural landscape of India. The historic Yamuna riverfront at Agra, one-time capital of the Mughal empire, is compared with the riverfront at Braj, sacred to the Hindus for its association with the god Krishna. The land-water interface at Braj is marked by steps that allow access to the river for bathing, shrines and temples for worship, and a porous architecture that facili- tates vision and movement in the public realm. In contrast, at historic Agra, the inter- face was marked by walls enclosing royal gardens, palaces, and tombs, creating private enclaves and permitting the common residents only interstitial access to the river, if any at all. Pavilions on riverfront terraces with gardens below framed views of the landscape, implying a separation between the viewer and the designated object. Although the river was the prime object of vision in both traditions, the Islamic mode of visuality was phe- nomenal presentation while the Hindu mode is iconic representation. The India current on the controversy construc- in India on the construc- tion of the Taj Heritage Corridor has focused the spotlight on the Yamuna riverfront and its future. Historians and archaeologists have given us a description of the six- teenth and seventeenth-century riverfront in Agra, but their view is largely architectural: it remains incomplete without interpreting the Mughal mode of engagement with landscape and the indigenous cul- ture's view of nature that shaped the Yamuna riverfront. In this paper, we analyze the visible traces of the dif- ferences between Islamic and Hindu practices and perception along the Yamuna River, focusing on Agra and on Mathura and Vrindavan in the Braj region. Although architecture is part of this picture, our focus is not on the buildings per se, but rather on the relationship of buildings to land and river, and the human experience of landscape. In our analysis of landscape experience, we distinguish between vision, which is "the mechanism of sight," and visuality, which is an his- torical mode of seeing that encom- passes cultural codes and practices (Foster 1988; Jay 1993). Both Hindus and Muslims employed vision in environmental design, but when Babur led the first Mughals to India from Afghanistan in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, he brought a specific visuality with him that not only influenced his percep- tion of the new landscape, but also caused the later Mughals to shape it in ways that satisfied those culturally determined visual expectations.1 Babur's complaints about the disor- derly, flat, dusty Hindustani land- scape are legion, and it is well known that he set about changing that landscape - in places like Agra and Dholpur - to better suit his visual tastes (Moynihan 1988, 1996). To some extent, Babur and his descendants introduced a "scopic regime" (in the words of Christian Metz) ; a dominant mode of seeing (prevalent in Islamic cultures elsewhere) that emphasized the separation of viewer and viewed (Jay 1988). 2 Landscape Journal 23:2-04 ISSN 0277-2426 Â© 2004 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System Sinha and Ruggles 141</page><page sequence="2">In contrast, Hindu visual prac- tice collapsed the distance. Hindus apprehended divinity in everyday life, and deities inhabited the land- scape and built environment around them so that the landscape was more than an object of vision: it was an animate, living being. The faithful viewer sought transcendental union, both visually and physically, between himself and the deified landscape. For this reason the Hindu and Muslim modes of visuality and expe- rience of landscape were very different. Nowhere can this be illustrated better than in the comparison of the Yamuna riverfront in Agra with the Braj region just 40 kilometers away with its principal cities located on Yamuna's banks. Agra, developed by the Mughals from 1526 CE onwards, was the capital of the Mughal empire and an Islamic dynasty that ruled over a population of both Hindus and Muslims. Braj was and is a sacred landscape, much revered by the Hindus because of its association with the Krishna legend (Kinsley 1975, Hawley 1983, Sinha 1994, Srinivasan 1989). Both Agra and Braj have historically been sustained by the River Yamuna. Not only is the river a life source, but it is also a very significant site of architectural and religious heritage. However, the riverfront presents different images in the two places that reflect dissimi- lar cultural traditions and visual practices. The land-water interface is marked by varied social functions and religious rituals, architectural responses, and landscape symbolism. Meaning and Significance Rising from the Yamunotri gla- cier in the Himalayas in the Tehri Garhwal district, the Yamuna flows for 1,380 kilometers almost parallel to the Ganga. Like other rivers in India, the Yamuna is sacred to Hindus. Its sacrality rests upon life- giving properties of water and its metaphorical potential to wash away moral and physical pollution. One among the divine triad of river goddesses (Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati) mentioned in the Rig- veda, the fame of Yamuna is second only to Ganga. Her status in Hindu mythology derives from the belief that she is the daughter of Surya (sun god) and sister of Yama (god of death) . Her kinship status thus links her with the forces of both life and death. In the Braj region, the Yamuna's divinity becomes imma- nent. Her role in Krishna mythology is crucial as animated landscape, divine consort, and idyllic pastoral setting. For example, when the infant Krishna's father transports him across the river on a dark, stormy night, the Yamuna calms her- self to ease their journey. Legend also has it that Krishna's older brother Balarama was upset at Yamuna's recalcitrance in coming when invited for water sports. He dragged her with a plow to Vrindavan, changing her course and causing a bend in her straight flow. Krishna's many playful antics as a young boy occur on Yamuna's banks. The defeat of serpent Kaliya is marked by Krishna dancing on its hoods in the river. He steals the clothes of gopis (wives of cowherds) as they bathe in the river (Figure 1). Playing the flute on the Yamuna bank, he entices them to come and sport with him in the groves of Vrindavan. These and other events along the river are celebrated in numerous representations in works of art through the ages: Pahari and Rajasthani paintings depict pic- turesque groves of trees on the Yamuna banks where Krishna plays the divine flute, dances with the gopis , and makes love to Radha (Randhawa 1982). Historically, for Muslims, the River Yamuna has none of these associations. Although water has a sacred dimension and is required for ritual cleansing prior to prayer, it is not deified, nor is the river distinct from any other body of water except in the sense of being a moving rather than static entity. It was useful and therefore attractive as an artery of transportation and as a plentiful source for water, both of which were necessary for Babur's building cam- paign favoring riverfront gardens.3 This preference for riverfront real estate increased with subsequent generations of Mughals. Both Shahjahanabad and Agra, the pri- mary Mughal political capitals, were situated on the Yamuna's banks, and both were developed to take full advantage of the water source, easy transportation, and riverfront views.4 For the Mughals, visuality played itself out in the following ways. First, the riverfront gardens that were begun in the time of Babur were deliberately sited to take advantage of the views of the Yamuna (Figure 2). Babur craved proximity to water and vastly pre- ferred the moving water of rivers to stagnant water tanks. He built raised terraces and enclosure walls that effectively separated garden space from river, ensuring safe refuge in flood season, as well a social separa- tion of the court from the residents of Agra (Wescoat 1991, 1992). According to Koch (1997a), these riverside estates were the genesis of later palatine complexes in Agra, as well as in Shahjahanabad and Lahore.5 At the Agra Fort, built in successive stages between 1565-1637, the elegant pavilions such as the Khass Mahal where the emperor and his family lived were perched high above the river, with carefully tended formal gardens on one side and on the other, views from the palace walls to the river and garden estates on the opposite bank (Figure 3) . Moreover, the pavilions stood at the highest point of the palace, elevated far above the river below, enhancing the range of view and ensuring a sense of separation between sub- ject/viewer and distant object. In addition to imperial palaces in Agra, dozens of walled gardens lined the river. Like the imperial palace, these were elite enclosures; however, they were used more informally for leisure. They lacked audience halls and do not appear to have had a specifically residential function. Gardens like the Ram Bagh (Bagh-i Nur Afshan), Bagh-i Jahanara, and the Mahtab Bagh as well as tombs such as Chini-ka rauza and that of Itmad ad-Dawla were all separated from the river by high protective 1 42 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="3">Figure 1. Krishna and the Gopls. (Courtesy of National Museum, New Delhi) Figure 2. View from Ram Bagh. (Photograph by A. Sinha) retaining walls on which pavilions gave views to the interior private garden and the exterior public landscape. Vision was enhanced in many features of Mughal architecture, and pavilions such as the Agra Fort's Shah Burj had chattris (kiosks) and protruding balconies that offered extensive panoramas (Figure 4) . The outer walls of the pavilions were often pierced by large windows with decorative screens that teased the eye, promising yet denying the full view of the landscape beyond (Ruggles 2003). The emperor him- self became an object within this visual field: he would regularly reveal himself within the framed jharoka (balcony) window. The Mughals drew upon the Hindu con- cept of darshan - in the jharoka-i- darshan, the emperor appeared to insinuate himself as a kind of deity who is both the subject and object of the gaze.6 The Mughals did not avoid the river: indeed, it was an important Sinha and Ruggles 1 43</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3. Khass Mahal, Agra Fort. (Photograph by O. Reuther) transportation artery for them. To reach the many gardens lining the banks of the river across from the Fort and Agra City, boats were the most practical vehicles. Sites like the Taj, the Tomb of Itmad ad-Dawla, and the Mahtab Bagh had boat landings on level with the river. However, unlike the ghats, which stretched horizontally along the river and facilitated public access, these landings served as tightly guarded gates that gave vertical access to terrace gardens high above the river. Mode of Landscape Engagement The Yamuna river corridor in Braj is a very different cultural land- scape than at Agra, resulting from distinctly different modes of visuality that emanated from the two respec- tive religious and cultural traditions. For the Mughals of Agra, visuality was a means of control, of domina- tion in a spatial context. The axis of vision separated the viewer from the landscape, and tactile experience was limited to vegetation and water in the gardens. Many of the build- ings did use the river to irrigate their interior gardens, but the ele- vated position of the garden and palace pavilions kept the viewers from going out and into the river, except for travel. In contrast, Hindu visuality does not separate the visual from the physical. For the Hindus in Braj, the Yamuna's sacrality elicits two kinds of engagement with the landscape: the visual ( darshan ) and the tactile {snana) . Snana is bathing, a tactile mode of engagement with the river in which the sensation of touching water, being immersed in it, and emerging out of it achieves its fullest expression through ritual value attached to the action (Figure 5). In bathing, one sheds papa (sin) and achieves punya (spiritual merit) . Physical cleansing becomes emblem- atic of and even equivalent to moral cleansing, and one emerges out of the water refreshed, rejuvenated, and purified. Bathing at dawn is ritu- ally prescribed, and the act is espe- cially meaningful on festivals marked by propitious stellar constellations. Life cycle events - birth, tonsure, menstruation, weddings, and death - are celebrated with a holy dip, marking the occasion and cleansing the body of pollution. Snana is especially beneficial at cer- tain spots, namely, confluences of streams and at riverbank locations, which are sacred as sites of mythic events. Darshan, the Sanskrit word for seeing, is a mode of visuality in which vision is interactive between object and viewer; indeed, the roles of object/ subject are mutually reflec- tive (Figure 6) . This mode of seeing is especially suited to experience of divinity in person, place, or ideas. According to Diana Eck (1981) darshan is the visual perception of the sacred. As the 'auspicious sight' of the divine, it means to see and be seen by the deity present in an image or a place. Thus, instead of looking at the river as an inert object, the river - a goddess - is able to respond and even, conceptually, to return the gaze. This exchange of gaze promotes a sense of well-being in the devotee. Seeing is a reaching out, a kind of metaphorical touch- ing that involves one's whole being and is reciprocal. The Experience of Landscape : Braj The shape of the Yamuna land- scape at Braj has evolved from centuries of visual and tactile engage- ment with the river. Modifica- tions that occur with continuous human use over time keep its essen- tial character alive, as is evident in a reading of the contemporary land- scape, much of it built in the nine- teenth century. The sacred region of Braj is bordered by Yamuna on whose banks are clustered the most significant constellation of pilgrim sites. These include Mathura (where Krishna was born), Vrindavan (the site of his many adolescent trysts), and Gokul (the place of his child- hood) . These riverfront sites are the destination of pilgrims and local res- idents alike. They are experienced both visually and tactically. Snana. With respect to bathing and the tactile experience, the land- water interface in sacred towns of Braj is constituted of ghats , or steps, stretching for a long distance. Visibly dominant features in the landscape, they enable access to the water as the river level changes. Built over a 144 Landscape fournal</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4. Shah Burj and its View, Agra Fort. (Photograph by D. Ruggles) period of time, their alignment is not straight but shifts to respond to the river and urban street network. The main function of the ghats is to take people down to the water to bathe. There are private enclaves in the ghats - the upper stories were often exclusive areas owned by the elite - but the ground floor, which touches the river, supports a plethora of other activities that make the riverfront spaces a truly public realm. In Mathura, the ghats run for about three kilometers, interrupted by residential buildings and shrines (Figure 7) . Historically they were the entry to the city, the river being the major artery of transportation. Parallel to the ghats runs a public street, looping off from the main bazaar. A number of city streets end on this spine, bringing human popu- lace and animals to the river. The stretch of twenty-two steps known as Vishram ghat (where Krishna and his brother Balarma rested after killing and cremating their evil uncle, Kansa) is a popular spot for bathing after the performance of life-cycle rituals and at festivals. / In addition, bathing at dawn is a daily activity for the faithful residents of Mathura. The land-water interface at Vrindavan too is marked by thirty- eight ghats along a two-and-a-half kilometer stretch. As the river curves around the peninsular land mass of Vrindavan town, the ghats shift in their alignment. Keshi ghat on the northeast is a prominent sacred spot marking Krishna's defeat of horse- demon Keshi.8 Only at Keshi and the nearby Pandawala ghat can one reach water, so these two ghats receive intense use. Darshan. With respect to the visual experience, the riverfront architecture at Mathura and Vrindavan is oriented towards dar- shan of the river in her phenomenal and anthropomorphic form. Darshan is a profound mode of place engagement that is not only about seeing the landscape as it is but also recognizing its divine attributes in its natural and representational forms. Yamuna's divinity is recognized and honored in daily visits to the riverfront for darshan , on festivals, and on parikrama y atras (ritual cir- cumambulations) . The simple act of seeing is celebrated in ritual activi- ties such as the evening aarti (waving of lamps accompanied with chanting glories of the deity) and meditative contemplation. Darshan of the river, as well as other deities, occurs in temples, and from the ghats , burjes (terraces solidly built or with chang- ing rooms underneath) , colonnades, Sinha and Ruggles 145</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5. Bathing at Keshi Ghat, Vrindavan. (Photograph by J. Wescoat) and chattris (octagonal or square pavilions with domed roofs) . The river is capable of chang- ing the way that she presents her- self to the devotee. She is an ever- flowing, wide expanse, swelling and receding with the seasons, turbulent and placid, reflective and dull under the changing skies. For the Hindus, this phenomenological aspect of see- ing stretches to include other modes of vision in which the river assumes the form of divine goddess. She is imagined thus in the mind's eye, and this vision is sculpted as a repre- sentation of a beautiful damsel in a voluptuous posture, standing on a tortoise and holding ajar of water in her bejeweled hands (Pandey 1984). In Braj, her divinity is associated with that of Krishna, and like Radha, she is his beloved. As his lover, she partakes of his traits - her darkness is said to be that of the blue god Krishna himself. Bathing in her waters purifies one of all sins, and more than that it prepares the devotee to be united with Krishna through love (Haberman 2000) . On the ghats of Mathura and Vrindavan, darshan of Yamuna occurs to both her phenomenal and iconographie form.9 The ghat architecture is porous with many openings towards the river (Figure 8) . The river is always in view, giving many opportunities for darshan in movement and at rest. Chattris occur at river level as well as on rooftops, and thus allow for framed and elevated views. Colonnades lining the ghats are multi-purpose public spaces that allow the experience of being simul- taneously inside and outside. Below them the steps and terraces allow for an even closer view of the river for those who wish to linger, perform puja (worship ritual) , or participate in the aarti. A series of arches from the Krishna-Balram shrine in the center of the Vishram ghat plaza to the ghat's edge frame the proces- sional way as well as direct gaze and movement to the water's edge. Braj, unlike Agra, has no sweeping visual axes that link grand monuments. Instead, serial vision frames nodes and guides movement. In Mathura, the visual axes shift with the meandering streets as they intersect with the ghats (Figure 9) . Coming from the bazar, the chattris along the river are a visually beck- oning element in an unfolding sequence of spaces (Ravindran 1990). The humanly scaled spaces expand and contract, the sense of confinement in them made more pronounced by the expansiveness of the river. Similar to the kinesthetic experience is the ocular experience of shifting cones of vision as one moves through the streets to the cul- minating panoramic vistas of the river. The Experience of Landscape: Agra The Agra riverfront is similarly adorned with chattris such as those of the Mah tab Bagh (opposite the Taj) and the Shah Burj of the Agra Fort.10 But here, the chattris and pavilions are set within the repeating unit of the enclosed garden, which could be residential or funerary. An early eighteenth-century map of Agra shows some forty-four such gar- dens adorning the banks of the Yamuna River, and eyewitness accounts of their existence include descriptions by the Dutch visitor Pelsaert and Abu'l Fazl, Akbar's his- torian (Figure 10). 11 Of these, the mausoleums and fort walls visually dominated - and, of course, by 1648, the Taj was the prime focal point. The siting of the Taj must have been deliberately chosen for visual effect: it is just on the bend in the river and can be seen from the pavilions of the Red Fort downstream.12 But vision also crossed over to the other side of the river, so that the gardens lining the banks looked across at each other, just as Mah tab Bagh and Taj gaze upon each other and were seen reflected in the river (Figure 1 1 ) (Moynihan 2000) . The pavilions, chattris , and even the raised terraces provided places for looking outward; they framed the view. Framing occurred at many points. It was a recurring theme in Mughal architecture: there was always a sight, framed by some lovely cusped arch of a window, bal- cony, or gate (Figure 12). Thus, the landscape was presented as a series of vistas in which an observer was positioned by architecture to enjoy a carefully composed view of a desig- nated distant object. The distance between viewer and object was essen- tial for the construction of the view. This mode of visuality relied on such presentations where landscape was objectified, framed, organized, removed from immediate grasp, and 1 46 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="7">Figure 6. Devotee receiving darshan of Krishna in a temple at Vishram Ghat, Mathura. (Photograph by A. Sinha) placed "out there" to be appre- hended by the eyes alone (Ruggles 1997). Distance and elevation allowed the eye to easily scan the skyline and read its elements; mean- while, within the walls, the eye could similarly scan and read the geomet- rical symmetry of the chahar bagh garden, experiencing it from the ele- vated objective position of a raised terrace. The preference for objectivity and enclosure was a ubiquitous form of visual and spatial organization in Islam that did not develop in direct response to the river or the particu- lar landscape character of Agra. Here at the Yamuna riverfront, how- ever, we see an application of a social way of seeing and experienc- ing that contrasts with another very different yet coexisting mode. The Yamuna did not cause this differ- ence; it was simply an environment that provides a case study where the difference can be easily discerned. Conclusion The two cultural traditions - Islamic and Hindu - have left very different impressions on the land- scape. The sixteenth and seven- teenth-century Yamuna riverfront in Agra was a landscape of imperial power. Its architectural vocabulary emphasized size and height and promoted a symbolic association between the emperor and the build- ing in life and death. Centralized authority was manifested in the con- cept of jharoka-i-darshan where the emperor appeared before the peo- ple gathered below, assuring a quasi- deification. While his gaze was directed at his domain - land, water, and people - his appearance in the framed opening was a continuing reminder of the power invested in his person.13 Though an architec- ture of chattris and pavilions was developed to enhance vision in both Agra and Braj, the meaning attrib- uted to vision was very different. For the Mughals, the Yamuna riverfront was presented to the eye via the device of framing. It was a source of aesthetic pleasure, of the stabiliza- tion of the visual field (and all that it represented), and reassurance of kingly status. For the devout Hindu, the river is a goddess; its banks sig- nify the eternal presence of Krishna, and they are an animated setting of powerful forces of nature. Vision is subjective and complex, and visual experience is different depending on one's depth of belief and pur- pose of visit. The faithful employ a mode of visuality in which the land- Sinha and Ruggles 147</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7. Ghats at Mathura. (Photograph by J. Wescoat) Figure 8. Vishram Ghat, Mathura. (Photograph by J. Wescoat). scape itself is acknowledged as a source of divine power. Although both Agra and Braj treated the river as a prime object of vision, the Islamic mode of visuality was phenomenal presentation while the Hindu visual mode was iconic repre- sentation. These visual modes did not develop in response to the river - their application transcends this par- ticular landscape. The river was important to both, but in different ways: the Mughal elite monopolized its views and access to it while the Hindus regarded it as a moving axis mundi with its spiritual benefits shared by the population at large. In Mughal capitals, the land- water interface was marked by a wall, whereas in the sacred centers of Hinduism, it took the form of ghats. The Agra riverfront, an ordered landscape of gardens, was essentially a private enclave of royalty and nobility, the city teeming with peo- ple kept at bay by walls. The land- scape displayed a high degree of uniformity and visual consistency, creating the impression of nature controlled and the river, tamed. In contrast, the ghats of Mathura and Vrindavan are and have been a kind of public commons where both recreation and religious rituals begin at dawn and last long after the sun has set. The physical setting and the activities it supports constitute a changing heterotopic order, in con- trast to the hegemonic landscape of Agra's Mughal riverfront whose dominant visual order spoke of splendor and politically motivated spectacle.14 The split between distant view- ing and immediate immersion is not explained by the separation of so- cial classes. Although the Mughals formed an elite ruling class, the royal palaces and riverside gardens were frequented and even inhab- ited by a great many Hindus: the emperor's mother, wives, female guests, and member of the political administration at al ranks. Similarly, ordinary men and women of middle and lower levels of society were both Hindu and Muslim. The modes of interaction between people and landscape identified here cannot be explained as essential attributes of Muslim and Hindu identity, nor as attributes of class.15 Rather, in the Foucauldian sense of the institution and de Certeau's model of domi- nant strategies versus individual tac- tics, vision and social practice took shape as collective responses to the interaction of culture (which is related to but not precisely cotermi- nous with religion) with landscape (Foucault 1977, de Certeau 1984). Representations of the Agra riverfront in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries show a high degree of visual conformity. 1 48 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="9">Figure 9.

(Courtesy of the Department of Landscape Architecture, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) However, although the imperial architecture and gardens appear to claim almost all of the riverbank and to dominate space, they could hardly have succeeded in repressing its other uses. Surely bathing, watering cattle, laundry, and cremation would occasionally have been possible in the interstices of that imperial space (Figure 13). We have seen on the eighteenth-century map that the thick band of walled gardens was punctuated at regular intervals by alleys that gave an alternative access to the river to those who were not in the gardens.16 A hegemonic mode of vision promises a sweeping panorama of distant landscape and usually delivers it, but it can over- look the small instances of differ- Sinha and Ruggles 149</page><page sequence="10">Figure 12. View of Taj Mahal from Agra Fort. (Courtesy of the Department of Landscape Architecture, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign) enee that are close at hand. Hence, our proposed modes of visuality, the phenomenal and the iconic, are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, individu- als probably could and did move between them, changing perspective and behavior as they did so. The Islamic and Hindu visualities that we have identified existed not as absolute models reflecting fixed modes of perception; rather, they operated as institutions of vision and spatial experience, constituting "scopic regimes" that were then inscribed architecturally in the landscape. Notes 1. Although ideologically presented as Islamic and Persianate, the Mughals were not exclusively Muslim, for many of the wives and viziers of that dynasty were of prominent Hindu families. In part as a result of this blending, the Mughal court reflects diverse practices, syncretic religious beliefs, artistic forms, and - at least until the reign of Aurangzeb - religious and social tolerance. 2. However, the Islamic visual culture was not entirely new, despite the claims of Babur and his descendants. The Muslim Ghaznavids had arrived in the early eleventh century, and by the late twelfth century, independent Islamic sultanates were established. Nonetheless, the Mughal conquest was a profound change in that it united large areas of South Asia that had previously been divided among Muslim and Hindu principalities. 3. Babur built gardens as territorial markers of conquest in the alien landscape of Hindu- stan, which he disliked. Wescoat (1991) be- lieves that these riverfront gardens at Agra were meant to be centers of military and courtly life in opposition to the citadel of the vanquished Lodhi rulers. 4. The fort palaces at Agra and Shah- jahanabad, as well as the one in Lahore (now in Pakistan), which were the nuclei of the Mughal capitals, were based upon the water- front garden module (Koch 1997b). 5. Babur's garden on the Yamuna river at Agra may have been the first to use the chahar bagh pattern, i.e., walled garden divided by intersecting walkways. The Mughal waterfront garden as it evolved combined a pavilion on Figure 13. The Yamuna riverfront below the Taj Mahal. (Photograph by A. Sinha) 150 Landscape Journal</page><page sequence="11">the riverfront terrace, framed by corner tow- ers of the enclosure wall, with the four-plot garden on the landward side (Koch 1997a). 6. Asher (1993) speculates that the earliest Mughal jharoka-i-darshan at Fatehpur Sikri, built by Akbar, was derived from projecting Rajput palace windows. Its continuing pres- ence in later Mughal and sub-imperial palaces shows its centrality in court rituals. 7. These include janmashtami (Krishna's birthday) , Kans Vadh ka Mela (fair celebrat- ing Kans's death) , Holi (festival of colors) , and Jam Dutia (when brothers and sisters bathe together, celebrating the meeting of Yama with his sister Yamuna) . Of the twenty- six festivals listed in Ravindran (1990), nine involve bathing. 8. For example, Cheerghat is named after the episode of Cheerharan, when Krishna stole the clothes of the bathing gopis and playfully hung them on the kadamb tree. Today, devo- tees, especially women, tie pieces of cloth on the Kadamb tree near the ghat for wish fulfillment as mentioned by Anand (1992). 9. She is worshipped in Bhai-Behn ka Mandir near Vishram ghat, especially on the festival known as Jam Dutiya when Yama visits his sis- ter Yamuna. Another temple between Kans and Vishram ghat houses shrines of Yamuna and Hanuman, right on the water's edge. At Keshi ghat in Vrindavan is yet another temple to Yamuna, also housing a linga (aniconic form of Shiva) and Nandi (sacred bull) . See Ravindran (1990) for details on shrines. 10. Koch (1986) describes one such chattri in Zahara Bagh in detail. The garden was founded by Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Shah Jahan, and added to by her daughter Jahanara. Though it did not have a chahar bagh layout, a paved walk from the gateway led to a main structure on the riverfront ter- race, framed by elevated towers. The surviving southwest corner tower is a two-storied, octag- onal pavilion crowned by the typical form of chattri found in Mughal garden architecture. Other gardens such as Bulund Bagh and Chin ka Rauza have similar towers and the type can be seen as well in palatine architecture such as Shah Burj of Agra Fort. 11. The early eighteenth-century map of Agra is in the Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum in Jaipur. For eyewitness sources, see Francisco Pelsaert (1978) and Abu'l Fazl (1978). 12. This view has been the subject of many paintings and photographs since the nine- teenth century when the "romance of the Taj Mahal" began to capture the Western imagi- nation. According to Pal (1989), among the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artists who depicted the Taj from the Agra Fort are the photographer Samuel Bourne and painters Albert Goodwin and Abanindranath Tagore. Today, picture postcards capturing the Taj silhouette across the river are as popu- lar as the mausoleum framed by its entrance gateway. Tourist guides unfailingly narrate to every visitor the story of the imprisoned Shah Jahan as he lay dying in Agra Fort, gazing longingly at the Taj. 13. Necipoglu (1993) points out that though darshan became a syncretic practice among the Mughals who ruled over a predominantly Hindu population, the reciprocity that the concept implied between the subject and the object was somewhat lost when the emperor revealed himself to his subjects daily after sun- rise. Mughal miniatures show Jahangir and Shah Jahan in profile with an averted gaze at the Agra Fort, implying the asymmetry of power between his person and those who gazed at him. 14. Mughal gardens elsewherÄ also demon- strate the high degree of visual order and the strategic location of pavilions and chattris on the visual axes. At the suburban Shalamar bagh in Lahore, now in Pakistan, the three chahar bagh terraces, one above the other, established a gradient of privacy and restricted access. The spatial layout spoke of the location of authority vested in the person of the emperor. Together with architectural features, it facilitated internal and external surveillance, created a dazzling visual specta- cle, and demonstrated a deliberate employ- ment of the vocabulary of power (Rasool and Sinha 1995). 15. Mythological accounts of Hindu king- doms at Mathura and Ayodhya (on the banks of the river Saryu) mention forts built at topographically high points in the landscape and not directly on the riverfront. Elite and commoners shared access to the holy river but in separate ghats. Indeed the earliest sur- viving palaces of the Hindu kings - Rajputs in Western India from the fifteenth century - were usually contained in the forts built on a hilly terrain. The location assured the resi- dents a panoramic view of the surrounding landscape, of great value in defensibility. However, as Tillotson (2001) points out, in contrast to the regularity of Mughal architec- ture, Rajput palaces made irregularity in plan- ning a virtue. With no discernable visual axes, the eye was entertained by an unpredictable succession of spaces, richly colored and intri- cately textured. Gardens in later Rajput palaces showed a strong influence of the Mughal tradition and were made visual foci in interior courtyards and objects of the gaze from dramatic overlook points (Ruggles 2002, 2003). 16. The present-day Yamuna riverfront at Agra, having lost most of the historic gardens, has evolved into a vernacular landscape of farm fields, nurseries, and small hamlets on the east bank. On the west bank, local uses dominate the decrepit park system between the city and the river upstream, while down- stream, parks, crematoriums, and nurseries prevent full public access to the river. In their midst are tourist enclaves - heritage sites - maintained and controlled by the Archaeo- logical Survey of India. Small temples with ghats to the river, mazars (tombs), and sacred trees allude to Yamuna's sacrality, albeit in a subdued way. References Anand, D. 1992. Krishna, The Living God of Braj.
