<plain_text><page sequence="1">Indian and Western Alchemy Derivations and Deformations of Patterns Arturo Schwarz The extent to which fundamental patterns of alchemical thought have been divested of their original liberatory contents can best be evaluated by the fact that, in the East, alchemy is currently associated with the search for a drug or elixir capable of granting perpetual youth, while in the West, the image of the alchemist has been reduced to that of a laboratory operator concerned mainly with the transmuta tion of lead into gold. The degradation of alchemy from what it originally was—an esoteric quest for awareness—came about in the East (India) during the Middle Ages as the result of the Muslim invasion, and in the West, in the third century of our era, with the decline of the culture of Hellenistic Egypt caused by the spread of Christianity. In India alchemy goes back to Vedic times, to at least 4,000 years before our era, and in Europe it can be traced to the pre-Socratic philosophers, about 600 years before our era. Thus the concepts which we generally associate with alchemy are not the ones that were prevalent during over four thousand years of its history. Rather, they are those that gained ascendancy as a result of two major historical cataclysms which brought in their wake, among other tragic consequences, a dramatic reversal of the liberatory concepts of alchemy which were originally forged into one of the most brilliant and complete philosophical systems the world has ever known. The cardinal concepts of alchemical thought in India are heavily indebted to the Shaivite philosophy of life and love, and because we can date the first records of Shaivism, we can also pin-point the time when alchemical concepts started to take shape in India. Shiva—the Agni, Indra, Ishana or Rudra of Vedic times—is the most ancient among the gods. He was conceived when man became aware of the indestructibility of the vital principle indentified with Based on a talk given at the India International Centre on 2 March 1981. Chairman: J.P.S.

Shiva is the embodiment of the factor which assures the continuity of life—of sexuality. Conceived as the union of opposites, Shiva embraces all aspects of the vital principle: at the psychic level he embodies 'solar' sexuality, that is to say, eroticism; at the emotional level he embodies love. Both eroticism and love (interchangeable terms in the Shaivite vocabulary) are privileged instruments of gaining awareness. Shiva also embodies the only constant principle in an ever-changing universe—the principle of the eternal transformation of every being and every thing. Since Shiva embodies the universal transforming agent he is, first, the Transformer rather than the Destroyer. (It is not by chance, then, that at Khajuraho, where the most beautiful temples dedicated to love and woman were built, Shiva is called Mantegeshvara, the Transformer.) The oldest representation of Shiva known to us today is the famous Mohenjodaro seal, on view at the National Museum in Delhi. This seal can be dated, by the carbon method, to around 2,300 B.C. However, new discoveries in Pakistan made about eight years ago by Professor Mohammad, enable us to establish a date of 3,000 B.C. for similar documents. The latter date is important because it marks a point of arrival of a tradition which represents Shiva in one of his more significant forms (naked, horned, ithyphallic and surrounded by animals), namely, as Pashupati, lord of the animals and protector of life. But what about Shaivite concepts'? Can we date their beginning? According to most scholars and archaeologists, it was during the Neolithic period, about 6,000 B.C., that the basic concepts of Shaivism started to take shape. The philosophical concepts associated with Shaivism and Indian alchemy began their westward migration at the time of the Persian dynasty of the Achaemenids. The Achaemenids helped in bridging the cultures of India and Greece, and the pre Socratic philosophers, who first developed in Greece the basic concepts of Western alchemy (between 600 and 400 B.C.), lived in the period which marked the climax of those cultural exchanges. I mentioned earlier that alchemy was originally an esoteric quest for awareness. Indeed, the alchemist was at one and the same time a man of thought and a man of action, a theoretician and a practitioner. He was above all both poet and craftsman. In Vedic times the divorce between the different branches of the quest for knowledge had not yet occurred. One word, 'karaka', stood for the creator and the artist and the craftsman. Later, there where two words: kaushala and kavi. Kaushala, whose meaning is very close to the Greek 'sophia' (wisdom), stood for a particular skill—at crafting or learning—while kavi was the word for poet, and more generically, for artist. The word 'kavf is derived from the Vedas where it was used as an attribute of the sun insofar as Surya was the personification of poetic genius. The alchemist of Vedic times was a karaka (a creator-artist and</page><page sequence="3">INDIAN AND WESTERN ALCHEMY 147 craftsman) as well as a kavi (a poet with kaushala, or the skill for learning). In a word, he was a wise man. We find the same situation in pre-Socratic Greece where the alchemist was not only a demiurgos (creator) and a technites (a technician), but also a poietes (an 'operator, creator, poet'). The alchemist's quest—the Great Work—was thus called poiesis, a term which identifies poetry with awareness. In his quest for awareness, the alchemist started by exploring the structure of matter because understanding matter meant understanding'his own body. Understanding his own body, in turn, signified liberating the individual through the knowledge of his psyche. Alchemy: An Instrument of Knowledge Alchemy is therefore an instrument of total knowledge; an initiatic form of knowledge that attempts to illuminate the way towards complete liberation. This knowledge obviously begins with the knowledge of one's Self, and the core of the alchemist's teaching can be summarized in the two words inscribed over the entrance to the temple of Apollo at Delphi: 'Gnothi Seauton'—Know Thy Self. The very phrase used to designate the object of the alchemist's work, The Philosopher's Stone, underscores the fact that his quest was for perfect knowledge. This meant that the means were identical to the end insofar as it was in his quest for the philosopher's stone that the alchemist gained awareness. Hence, ultimately, the quest is the goal, just as the means are the end. The relationship between means and end is best exemplified by the two Sanskrit words that stand for those two terms: prajna and jnana. Prajna—equivalent to the quest—is a continuous process aimed at acquiring knowledge, a process whose end is the absolute knowledge that will enable the individual to transform himself and thus obtain moksha (liberation). On the other hand, jnana—equivalent to the philosopher's stone—is a state of being. It defines the alchemist who, in the course of his quest for awareness, has learned to overcome all contradictions including those between theory and practice; one who has bridged the gap between the seeker (the quest for knowledge) and the search (knowledge itself). Having become one with the object of his search, the seeker attains moksha: he is knowledge. The concept of moksha (awareness of one's own nature) runs like a leitmotiv not only through all alchemical teaching but also in all the philosophical religious texts of Hinduism. In Abhinavagupta's Tantrasara we read: 'Knowledge is the cause of liberation since it suppresses ignorance which is the source of dependence', The same concept is expressed in the Shiva Sutras: 'Ignorance of one's own real nature ... is the cause of bondage',1 while the sudden intuition</page><page sequence="4">1 48 ARTURO SCHWAR7. of knowledge, an intuition which is a direct, spontaneous experience of reality, puts 'a stop to bondage that arises on account of spiritual ignorance'.2 To put it briefly: knowledge-self-awareness, the first fundamental aspect of Hinduism and alchemy, is the precondition of freedom. The Unity of the Whole The second basic pattern of alchemical thought can be summed up in the three Greek words that open many alchemical texts: en to pan, that is to say, 'in the One is the Whole'. This unitary vision of the Whole implies the fundamental unity of the universe. Hence totality is synonymous with completeness or wholeness at all levels. In the case of the individual, wholeness signifies the achievement of the unity of the divided Self. At the cosmological level, the achievement of this unity expresses itself in the discovery that the individual is an active part of the universe. The harmonious relationship that binds the individual to the universe is double-sided: interdependency as well as interaction are reciprocal. At the biological level, this unity of the Whole implies that the individual is also a Whole: both male and female at the same time, and it is only the predominance of one of the two principles over the other that determines the sex of the individual. At the psychological level the fracture of the divided Self is healed when a harmonious and dialectical integration of the male and female sides of our psyche is achieved. This unitary concept of the Whole is a basic postulate of Indian philosophic and religious thought. The totality includes not only the manifestation of the creative principle—the universe—but also the three fundamental aspects of this principle—Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. The Brahman ('that which is One') is pure power which manifests itself in the triad. This totality also includes the male cosmic principle of 'solar' awareness as well as the female cosmic principle of immortality. The latter totality is expressed by the Cosmic Man (the Purusha) in whom, according to the Rig Veda,3 each aspect of the creative principle, just as each one of its manifestations, is a part of his body. The Katha Upani shad clarifies, in turn, not only that the Purusha is hidden in ail beings4 but also that the Purusha includes in himself the female cosmic principle, namely the Prakriti, or the prime substance of the universe. Primordial Incest of the Conciliation of Opposites The third basic pattern of alchemical thought is a logical consequence of the postulate of the unity of the Whole. It can be expressed in a simple word, advaita, which in Vedantic Hinduism expresses the concept of the 'non-duality of the duality'. Advaya is the corresponding term in</page><page sequence="5">Indian and Western alchemy 149 Tantric Buddhism, while in Shaivism the ter,m assumes an anthropo morphic connotation with the Ardhanarishvara, which I shall discuss when looking at the fourth and last alchemical archetypal pattern. In the very first verses of the Shiva Sutras we find a synthetic and precise formulation of the unitary aspect of the duality: 'In its wholeness [Samkara] is non-dual in reality though having an appearance of duality'.5 Samkara is, at one and the same time, the Supreme Aware ness, Shiva—the creative principle and its manifestation. The male-female polarity is the basic model for all other polarities: heat and cold, day and night, life and death, joy and sorrow, etc. The union of the two terms of any polarity is expressed metaphorically by the theme of incest. The theme of the union of the male and female cosmic principles is seen as the origin of the cosmogonic process (as the origin of the universe) just as the differentiation of the One into its two components, male-female, brother-sister, father-daughter is the precondition for incestuous union. The origin of the universe as a result of the conciliation/union of the male-female polarity is a universally disseminated theme. In the Indian tradition it recurs in all the sacred texts. In the earlier Veda, inccst is expressed metaphorically by the abstract image of the One which divides into a Second with whom it unites. Soon the image assumes a cosmological connotation and creation is conceived as the separation (differentiation) of the male element (Heaven) from the female element (Earth). The third stage of development of this incestuous pattern acquires its anthropomorphic form when it assumes the familiar character of the hicrogamic union: father daughter or brother-sister. We find three different stages of this theme in one of the most beautiful Upanishads, the Brihad-Aranyaka Upanishad. At first Mrityu (the male aspect that personifies Silence) unites with Vac (his feminine aspect that personifies Sound) to create the temporal dimension in which life can develop.0 The theme of the One that divides in two is expressed a few pages later when the Purusha 'who became as large as a woman and a man in close embrace . . . caused that Self to fall into two parts. From that arose husband and wife'.7 Finally, the third time we meet this theme in this Upanishad we arc told that it is the union of father and daughter which is the origin of all living creatures.8 One of the most poetic hymns of the Rig Veda is dedicated to the incestuous twins Yama (Lord of the Dead, psychopomp, and personifi cation of the cosmic fire) and Yami (personification of the cosmic water and of soma, the heavenly dew). The human species is in fact born of the union of Yama and Yami, which is another way of saying that each individual harbours Yama (the male principle) and Yami (the female principle), and that the union of awareness (personified by Yama, who is the cosmic fire and illumination) with Yami (the heavenly waters,</page><page sequence="6">1 50 ARTURO SCHWARZ soma), points allegorically to the concept that immortality is attained by he who becomes aware of his inner self. The Primordial Androgyne: The Rebis Before discussing the fourth and last basic pattern of alchemical thought let us summarize what has been said so far. At the base of alchemical philosophy—one of the very few optimistic philosophic systems of mankind—is the urge for knowledge and the urge for liberation (knowledge and liberation being interdependent terms). But in the same way as, for the alchemist, theory cannot be divorced from practice, so knowledge for its own sake is useless unless it illuminates the way that leads to liberation. Knowledge reveals to the alchemist the universality of prime matter and the unity of the Whole. This unity constitutes the theoretical basis for his materialist and atheist conception of the world. The impulse towards the differentiation of prime matter into its male and female components is motivated by the conflictual polarity of its opposite principles, and this polarity is conciliated at the mythical level by alchemical incest. Alchemical incest, in turn, is nothing else but the allegorical expression of the androgynous nature of the individual. The main concern of the alchemist is the conciliation of the two terms of the conflicting male-female polarity, a conciliation which gives birth to a third term which is not a static synthesis of the male and female com ponents but rather a third, entirely new and dynamic term: the mythical androgyne, or the duality whose male and female components do not cancel each other out but, on the contrary, enhance each other. Thus the androgyne is not the sum of two opposite terms, but is a new term in which the essential characteristics of the male and female components co-exist harmoniously, competing with each other and completing each other. In Western alchemy this androgyne is called the Rebis and its very name, res-bis, the thing which is double, points to its dual sexual character. For Shaivism the androgyne is the Ardha-nar-ishvara, that is to say, as the name reveals, 'the Lord whose half is woman', namely, half Shiva half Parvati. The androgyne is an allegory of the total personality which is enriched by the contribution of both its aspects, the female as well as the male. Each of those aspects constitutes only one half of the integrated personality. The Rebis, exactly like the Ardha-nar ishvara, stands for the complete integrated personality and hence is a perfect image of the psyche's unitary totality. The Total Individual, the homo totus of the alchemical tradition, is the initiate who recognizes himself in both aspects of his personality, the female as well as the male. And Indian as well as Western alchemical texts anticipate with surpris ing precision the concept of the androgynous psyche. For Jung every</page><page sequence="7">INDIAN AND WESTERN ALCHEMY 151 man carries in himself an image of the feminine which is an active component of his psyche and which he called anima; in the same way every woman harbours in herself an image of the masculine, which is again an active component of her personality and which he termed the animus. Two fifteenth-century alchemists express the very same idea: 'As a shadow continually follows the body of one who walks in the sun ... so our Adamic hermaphrodite, though he appears in masculine form, nevertheless always carries about with him Eve or his feminine part hidden in his body',9 and 'Adam bears an invisible Eve hidden in his body'.10 Reverting to Indian alchemical writings and to the Shiva Puranas, we find the same concepts expressed in a most poetical form: 'Shakti is Mahadevi herself and Mahadeva is one possessing Shakti .... Just as Shiva so also the goddess. Just as the goddess so also Shiva. No difference shall be thought of between the two as between the moon and moonlight. Just as the moon does not shine without the moonlight, so also though existing Shiva does not shine without Shakti.'11 Let us try to sum up the importance of this last pattern of alchemical thought which has been briefly outlined. The acquisition of awareness, of knowledge, implies the discovery of one's own androgyny. Awareness and androgyny are the two fundamental qualities of the divinity. In turn, since awareness and androgyny imply perfection, the divinity is also immortal. The divinity is immortal because it is androgynous. The divinity is immortal because immortality is the attribute of perfection, and perfection, in turn, implies a non-divided personality—an androgynous personality. The individual who ignores his double nature lives with only half of his being, his personality is divided and he lives in spiritual misery. The universal myth of the Androgynous Divinity is an esoteric metaphor for one of the deepest psychological trends of the individual: the urge to reconstitute the unity of one's divided Self. The alchemist thus shares with the divinity its three main attributes: androgyny, awareness and creativity—the latter attribute being implicit since awareness is identified with the philosopher's stone which gives the alchemist creative powers and enables him to transform himself. It is therefore not surprising if the alchemist, having gained the attributes of divinity, does away with a divinity extraneous to his being; a divinity which would reintroduce a dualistic fracture in his unitarian and totalizing universe. Tat Tvam Asi (Thou Art That) The words tat tvam asi—which return again and again in the Upanishads, the Puranas and even the Bhagavadgita—express in a</page><page sequence="8">152 ARTURO SCHWARZ nutshell all that 1 have said concerning the identification of the individual with divinity, and hence of the individual with awareness which entails becoming conscious of one's androgynous nature. One of the most profound and beautiful explanations of these three words is to be found in the Shiva Puranas12 and I would like to convey the essence of this exegesis. What is intended by 'that' is perfect knowledge, which is at one and the same time, the Brahman (universal principle), the Atman (one's Self: the individuation of this universal principle), the vital breath of all the elements, the past, the present, the future, and he who is liberated. The ecstasy of perfect knowledge is the result of the union of Shiva with his Shakti. Shiva in turn is identified both with Hamsa, the male principle of awareness, and with Shakti, the female principle of awareness. Finally, so as to leave no doubt concerning the identification of the individual with divinity and with awareness, and hence the ultimate significance of 'Tliou art That', the 'identity of man with Shiva himself'13 is stressed. Thou art That, or in a less elliptical way, you are the universal principle, hence you are free, immortal and androgyne if you succeed in gaining awareness of your identity with the Brahman who, in turn, is androgynous, immortal and free. This urge for awareness, which is synonymous whith immortality and liberation recurs endlessly throughout the Upanishads and the Puranas. Let me quote from the Brihad-Aranyaka Upanishad these extremely poignant lines: 'From the unreal lead me to the real/from darkness lead me to light/from death lead me to immortality'.14 The comment on the word 'satyam' that we find in the Chandogya-Upanishad is not less explicit: 'Verily, these are three syllables sat, ti, yam. The sat, that is the immortal. The ti, that is the mortal. The yam, with it one holds the two together .... He who knows this goes day by day into the heavenly world'.15 In current language, 'sat\ which in these verses is immortality, signifies the Being and, at the same time, truth and objective reality; while 'satyam' is truth and absolute reality. The logic which governs the identifications awareness-individual, individual-immortality, divinity-androgyny, and hence individual divinity, is reflected in these few lines of the Shiva Purana: 'Avidya (the non-knowledge) is perishable while vidya (knowledge) is imperishable. He who rules over the two is Lord Shiva. He is different from the Duality.16 Those who know the non-dualistic nature of Shiva . . . have understood the concept of non-dualism . . . and attain an ever-lasting happiness . . . such a disciple becomes the preceptor Shiva himself .... Becomes himself Shiva .... This is the Shaivite philosophy of non-dualism . . . Duality perishes, and the non-dualism remains imperishable . . . This universe of the form of female and male, of the form of Shiva and Shakti shall deserve attention of</page><page sequence="9">INDIAN AND WESTERN ALCHEMY 153 learned man.'17 Elsewhere it is again emphasized: 'All men are indentical with Shiva. All women are identical with Maheshvari.'18 Concerning the fundamental atheism of the alchemist and of both Hinduism and Buddhism, let me recall the words of Chandidas, the great fifteenth-century Bengali mystic philosopher: 'Man is superior to all things, and nothing excels him' (p. 102). The Shiva Puranas remind us: 'The entire universe is eternal. It has no creator nor is it an object of creation. It evolves itself and gets annihilated by itself.... Living beings have heaven and hell here itself and not anywhere else \19 Gautama Buddha exhorted his disciples endlessly: 'Be your own lamp'. He wanted to liberate mankind from the slavery of the gods and from the belief in an arbitrary God-creator. He was the embodiment of the qualities we attribute to divinity but which are latent in each one of us. 'It is, therefore, not the man Gautama who was raised to the status of a god, but the "divine" which was recognized as a possibility of human realization!'20 Wisdom can become a reality for us only if it is realized in our lifetime, if it becomes part of human existence. The alchemist's atheism is an obvious consequence of his belief in the fundamental unity of the universe. Nature is One, and One is the universal substance. Creator and creature are but two aspects of the same substance. The alchemist, as well as the Hindu, cannot accept the metaphysical and dualistic gap between creator and creature, and he therefore establishes between the two a dialectical relationship that governs the transformation of the one into the other. God is man and man is God, in the words of the Corpus Hermeticum: 'The terrestrial man is a mortal god, while the heavenly god is an immortal man . . . and the Whole is the product of the One'.21 Let me try to sum up what has been said, and attempt to outline the consequences of the philosophical principle that governs the whole structure of alchemical and Hindu thought which has been expressed in the lapidary formula, non-duality of the duality. Advaita, or advaya, the non-duality of the duality, implies that the feminine is an aspect of the masculine, and vice versa. The existence of the one depends upon the existence of the other. The two terms are in a complementary relationship and not in an antagonistic one. Every thing can be itself and something else at the same time, thus the masculine is the feminine, and vice versa; both contain their own opposites without their identity being altered in any way by this fact. This becomes possible in the light of what Indian scholastic methodology calls samanvaya, namely the reconciliation of notions that are contradictory by elevating them to a level where such contradictions cease to exist and are no longer valid.</page><page sequence="10">154 ARTURO SCHWARZ Indian and alchemical thought reject the Aristotelian principle of identity according to which one thing cannot be itself and something else at the same time, and hence that opposites cannot be reconciled or united. It also rejects the classical notion of synthesis according to which the contradictions between thesis and antithesis are resolved in a static form of synthesis. Alchemical thought shares with advaita and advaya, the belief that the male-female polarity in the individual is in a state of complementary equilibrium which enhances the identity of its two component parts because it is this very complementarity which is the source of life. The discovery of the fundamental androgynous pattern of our psyche, which implies that something can be itself and its opposite at one and the same time, evidenced the fact that the two terms of a polarity can have a complementary relationship instead of an antagonistic one. This belief is the basic premise for a non-sectarian, non-violent, and libertarian attitude. In the Shiva Puranas, these three attitudes are ceaselessly exalted: 'Non-violence is the greatest virtue'.23 'All the embodied beings are equal .... It is unnecessary to divide the people into different castes. When all are men who is superior and who is inferior? . . . Some of the ancestors thought that the four castes are born of mouth, arms, thighs, etc., of Brahma . . . . How can sons born of the same body or from the same body be of four different castes? Hence the divisions of castes and outcastes do not appear to be sound. Hence no difference between man and woman should be entertained'*23 It is obvious that this libertarian urge should also affect the relation ship between man and woman. For the alchemist, the very notion of the androgynous self implies the complete equality of the sexes and their complementarity. Throughout the history of alchemy woman has been exalted as the companion, the inspirer and the co-worker. Women alchemists are frequently spoken of in the history of alchemy, and Pernelle, the wife and companion of the great alchemist Nicolas Flamel is not an isolated case but almost the rule. Shaivite philosophy emphasizes the same point. In the Lingarcana Tantra, a play of words sums up beautifully the whole question: 'With out Shakti, the Supreme Master (Mahesha) is nothing but a corpse (Sava). Only in union with her (his Shakti) can Sadashiva act'.24 Shakti, the primordial energy and the female cosmic principle is the very vital energy of Shiva, his very life. The subtle play on words between Shiva and Shava is sustained by a rigorous grammatical law. In the Devanagari script, the basic signs represent the consonants plus the vowel a; to convert the vowel a into i one must add a vocal sign, and this sign is nothing else but the sign of the Shakti. Which means that without its feminine element, i, Shiva is pronounced Shava—a corpse. In the Shiva Purana the same concept is expressed with great poetical</page><page sequence="11">INDIAN AND WESTERN ALCHEMY 155 pathos: 'Originally, when Shiva was separated from Shakti and was pure consciousness alone, He was attributeless, free from alternatives, devoid of forms and beyond the existent and the non-existent. He, the greatest of the great and of changeless form when united with Shakti, was filled with attributes and had specific forms and divine features'.25 We find the same idea expressed in Tantric Buddhism, with a reversal of the terms but with the same implications in the single brief verse: 'Without the bridegroom the bride is dead'. I would like to narrate the beautiful story of the birth of the Ardha-nar-ishvara. In one of the versions of this myth it is said that Gauri (Shiva's Shakti who embodies beauty and the pleasure of love) saw her image reflected on the chest of Shankara (Shiva in his auspicious form); she became immediately jealous, thinking that Shiva had another woman in his heart. Having realized that the rival was merely the reflection of her own image, she asked and obtained the boon of be coming forever, part of the body of Shiva. Almost all the other variants of the myth make it clear that the basic motivation for the birth of the Ardha-nar-ishvara is love. Thus, in the Shiva Purana it is said that Parvati was so much in love with Shiva that she asked to become part of his body; she thus 'performed many wonderful divine sports and gained half of the body of Shiva'.20 The meaning of this story is quite clear. The Ardha-nari-ishvara stands for completeness and full awareness; its birth is motivated by love. Love is thus an instrument of initiatic awareness. The fundamental duality is the sexual duality, being able to transcend this sexual duality implies transcending all the other dualities. Love is the royal way, which enables us to live the transcendental concept of the non-duality. Aware ness means, in first place, understanding one's Self. If love is an instrument of knowledge it is because to love means to understand, and hence understand the other One, who is always a reflection of one's own Self—as the beautiful story of the Ardha-nar-ishvara teaches us. Love helps us discover in our partner our own double; it enables us to recognize him in our own self, giving us the possibility of becoming aware of the fundamental androgynous nature of our psyche. In a word, love is jnana: illumination. Insofar as love is an instrument of knowledge it is also an instrument for transforming life and the world. Transforming life means transform ing the individual, and transforming the individual implies the knowledge of one's Self. And this takes us back again to the cardinal concepts of alchemy and Hinduism. In fact, the transmutation or transformation of matter is but a metaphor for the transformation of man, and the transformation of man is enacted through the acquisition of jnana—illuminating awareness. Through knowledge, transformation; through love, immortality; since androgyny means completeness and perfection, and perfection implies immortality.</page><page sequence="12">156 ARTURO SCHWARZ For the three basic monotheistic religions—Judaism, Christianity and Islam—woman, sex and awareness are the cause of man's loss of immortality and of his expulsion from Paradise into the valley of tears, toil and sweat. It is evidence of the life-hating and sex-repressive out look of those three religions that woman, sex and awareness are embodied by Eve, the archetypal woman and Great Mother, and that Eve embodies, in turn, everything that is evil and inferior. Adam is kicked out of Paradise as soon as he tastes the sweet fruit of the Tree of Wisdom, which is offered to him by Eve, who is initiated by the kundalini, which in the Biblical account is a snake. Awareness and love, the two cardinal virtues of Hinduism, are two deadly sins for mono theistic religion. And woman, the shakti of Hinduism, the prajna of Buddhism, the fount of life, love, and of transcendental ccstasis—she who gives energy and awareness—is instead the embodiment of 'original sin' and the cause of misery and death for the Judeo-Christian tradition. Hinduism and alchemy glorify love and awareness, not misery and ignorance; life and joy, not death and sorrow; the individual—-'be your own lamp'—and not the leader. I mentioned at the start that the spread of Christianity and the Muslim invasion of India were the two historical cataclysms that brought about a reversal of the liberatory concepts of alchemy. In fact these two religions brought in their wake not only a completely different outlook concerning the two basic issues of love and awareness, as has been pointed out, but this very approach entailed two pernicious postulates which negate the very essence of alchemical thought. The first of these postulates is the belief in a god alien to ourselves, this belief established a fracture between god and man and it created thus an artificial duality which denied the profound unitary nature of the Whole. By delegating to a being extraneous to himself all creative, intellectual, and decisional power, man also abdicated autonomous thinking and acting, and this meant that awareness, which is the precondition for independent thinking, and the very goal of alchemy, was no longer to be pursued. Even worse, it became a deadly sin! The second postulate established by Christianity and Islam derived from an extrapolation of the causality principle which establishes a linear and one-way relationship between a cause and its effect such that when one occurs the other necessarily follows or must have preceded the other. Applying this principle to the universe—deemed to be the effect—a theoretical justification for the existence of god (the cause) was provided. There is, of course, a flaw to this reasoning which only displaces one step backward the terms of the question, for then one is bound to ask, What is the cause of god? And if the answer is that god is its own cause, then it is just as plausible to say</page><page sequence="13">INDIAN AND WESTERN ALCHEMY 157 that the universe is its own cause. But the causality principle pursued to its logical extreme is also responsible for the so-called 'scientific' and 'analytical' approach to reality which denies the holistic outlook which structures Indian and alchemical thought. In the 'scientific' approach no room is left for what is termed 'illumination' which is always the result of bridging the gap between theory and practice, between thinking and acting. By breaking up the harmonious Whole into unrelated parts, man stopped at the tree and lost sight of the forest; he became blind to the unitary structure of the Whole and to the force which animates the universe. Termed 'advaita' by Hinduis, and 'conjunctio oppositorum' by the alchemists, this force springs from the complementary relationship of the polarities. Practically speaking, with the 'scientific' approach to reality, Islamic chemistry uprooted Indian alchemy by taking in its literal sense the poetical metaphor of the transmutation of base metals (uninitiated man) into noble gold (initiated man). Thus the goal of alchemy, which is summed up in the dictum 'know thyself' was debased to the goal of chemistry which sought only to 'know' raw matter instead of the subtler matter which is the individual. Finally, Christianity and Islam grossly misunderstood the essence of our esoterical quest, and not content with corrupting its concepts of love and awareness, these religions attempted to stamp out its liberatory urge by persecuting its exponents as heretics and misbelievers. It is through love that awareness is gained, and through awareness that immortality is gained. In the words of the Sutta Nipata, 'may every living thing be full of joy . . . firm in the mindfulness of love. For this is what men call the Sublime Mood'. □ References 1.
