Humans on Earth, a small planet which is of negligible dimension as compared to the universe, need not forget the infinite scope and power of the Creator. Religious and social beliefs do not necessarily have harmony with science. Yet many unexplained aspects of human life through scientific theories and logic still end up taking refuge in the domain of religious and social beliefs—just not the animistic or anthropomorphic beliefs of many traditional religions. However, some of the scientific theories, like the mass energy relationship, have been accepted by religious leaders and interpreted in their own way. In the end, the broad objectives of both scientific and religious studies are to unfold the secrets of nature and discover truths of our existence. CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE AND LESSONS LEARNED Scientists postulate that the universe began billions of years ago in an event called Big Bang. Why it happened is perhaps the greatest of all mysteries to both scientists and religious philosophers. How it happened from a scientific viewpoint is nothing short of divine! It is believed that all matter, energy as well as space and time, was created during this event. At the time of this event the universe had infinite density and zero distance. After the big bang the universe began expanding, which resulted in the universe becoming larger and cooler, a trend scientists still observe today. During the expansion of the universe a time came when matter and radiation could no longer interact as freely with each other and the matter in the universe began to cool, forming stars and galaxies. Likewise the radia tion that filled the universe became more diluted as the universe expanded. Matter formed itself into lumps that were the forerunners of primitive galaxies. Due to the force of gravity, these lumps grew smaller and began to spin faster, flattening out into the rough disc shapes that we see in these giant rotating wheels of matter. Within these galaxies smaller clouds, also experiencing gravitational collapse, eventually formed clusters of hot young stars. On the macro scale, we see clusters of galaxies and perhaps clusters of clusters. Our own local group of galaxies is an insignificant collection of two large galaxies along with a few minor ones. Our local group is a part of the Virgo Supercluster which contains some tens of thousands of galaxies. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE 62 VOL. XXIX NO. 4 DECEMBER 2012</page><page sequence="3">UNIVERSAL PEACE THROUGH A BALANCE OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION There has been conflict between science and religion due to diverse views on many aspects of Creation. The foundations of the two are also different. Science requires stringent logical rules followed by experimental verification and vice versa, whereas religious and cultural beliefs are based on more limited knowledge and more faith, filling in gaps by ascribing reasons behind observed phenomena. History has seen prosecution of scientists by political rulers holding religious views. And scientists are currently criticized by religious leaders when they are unable to validate their own theories of science and posit their own reasons to fill in gaps in knowledge. Science and religion each have different approaches to truth and their typical roles should be better respected if we are to reduce conflicts and establish peace. Science and religion can work together to understand the truths which both are seeking. Religion needs to be cognizant of science's needs for repeat- Many unexplained ability and evidence, while science needs aspects of human life to be sensitive to the lessons learned through scientific theories by human civilization that reside in the gnd ,ogic stm en(J up non-rational values and habits promoted Rj f . h by the fittest and most resilient cultures . , . ,. , domain of religious and which gave rise to science. In most religions, miracles have been socia e ie S" attributed to individuals who seem to have control over space and time. Could these miracles be possible due to glimpses of the Ultimate by enlightened people? Scientific minds do not readily accept these things, as they cannot be explained by empirical evi dence and controlled experiments. That said, science also has its fair share of scientific miracles! The common notion that every event must have a cause, does not apply in science when considering the particles that make up atoms (e.g. quarks and leptons). Scientists can now envisage a situation where matter can be created out of nothing, along with the dimensions of space and time in which they can exist. This is because the science of quan tum physics permits events without a cause. The uncertainty principle has brought probabilistic aspects into the realm of physics. However, some areas of pure mathematics and classical theories interpret randomness promoted by such theories as the refuge of ignorance! This is not much different from the way natural scientists view traditional religious philosophies. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXIX NO. 4 DECEMBER 2012 63</page><page sequence="4">UNIVERSAL PEACE THROUGH A BALANCE OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION On the matter of creation, we can argue that both science and religion provide mystical explanations. While completely different from the reli gious explanations, the scientific theories on the creation of the universes are nothing short of a mystical description. Quasars seem to be mainly a phenomenon of the early universe. It is believed that they are super-massive black holes residing at the centers of galaxies. As the material is sucked into the black hole by its gravity it becomes very hot and releases large amounts of radiation. It is suspected that the matter that fuels a black hole will only be available during the galaxy's youth and eventually the supply will run out, making the black hole almost dormant. This is the reason many scientists suspect that most, if not all, well-behaved galaxies have dormant black hole at their core. However, such black holes may still be capable of occasionally waking up from an uneasy sleep!

Fragments of the gas clouds break off and start to collapse under their own gravity. In becom ing smaller these clouds grow hotter and the cloud becomes a proto-star, which shines because of the energy liberated by the process of collapse. Eventually the temperature at the center of the proto-star attains a critical level and a nuclear reaction commences. In this manner, the star is born. In a million years the collapse is halted when the weight of the outer layer is supported by the high temperatures and pressure generated by the nuclear reactions. At the core of an average star, like our sun, every second 400 million tons of hydrogen is converted to helium, liberating energy as it changes. Stars (like our sun) shine due to internal nuclear fusion and are in many different forms. The brightest stellar luminaries in our galaxy are some 10 million times brighter than our sun and these objects are considered rare. The more common stars are feebler than our sun. A star's consumption INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE 64 VOL. XXIX NO. 4 DECEMBER 2012</page><page sequence="5">UNIVERSAL PEACE THROUGH A BALANCE OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION of its nuclear fuel, and therefore its lifetime, depends upon its mass. The life of the shining of stars like our sun is about 10 billion years. Before our sun runs out of nuclear fuel completely it will undergo dramatic changes. It will collapse to become a white dwarf, a cosmic cinder the size of Earth and made of nuclear ash weighing a ton per teaspoonful! It will cool and fade until our universe dies! One of the important contributions of science has been provided by Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity through mass-energy relation, which has wide applications. Material contents at the speed of light are converted into energy. The mass-energy relationship is popularly compared by phi losophers to the body-soul relation, as well as mortal and immortal aspects. Genetic engineering is actively involved in assessing the patterns of gene traits and transfers of genes in the living organism.

The migrating pattern of birds has been proven through detection devices attached to their bodies. Could science, in the near future, advance to a level that would possibly confirm the transmigration of soul or will it remain an unresolved secret only in the domain of God or Cosmic Consciousness? A unique aspect of the physical universe is that everything which is created is bound to die. However, there is an enormous difference in the life spans and time frames of, for example, the life of a human being and the life of a star. It is sometimes stated that, "one of the biggest wonders in the world is that, humans know that death is a certainty (with probabil ity one), yet they do not readily accept it." Some philosophers, as well as scientists, pose an interesting question, "is the death of the universe and living organism the cause or motivation for recreation"? Such a hypothesis is of great interest in religious and cultural philosophies, especially in the INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXIX NO. 4 DECEMBER 2012 65</page><page sequence="6">UNIVERSAL PEACE THROUGH A BALANCE OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION area of reincarnation or past lives, but this could be difficult to test in a scientific environment. Religious and cultural arguments, in some faiths, propagate the idea that it is only ascension which is possible for humans, such that through noble deeds their souls can merge with the Ultimate. This seems to be comparable to mass converting to energy. The conversion of energy into mass is yet to be accomplished by science. Does such a feat remain for God to will? Many religions and cultures teach that, through the Creator's wish, Messengers, Prophets and Incarnations descend at different times to our Earth (and maybe other parts of universe) and speak to living organisms with relatively higher (perceived) levels of consciousness, This enables the divine to shine through and reveals itself . in their noble deeds and preaching.

Does this further demonstrate that it is possible for humans to attain immortality and infinite bliss? Is the self that is seen through human emotion and feeling some sort of evidence of God in us? Some of the more massive stars end their lives more dramatically in a supernova explosion. During such an explosion one star can outshine a galaxy of its companions for many days. It is believed that the core of a giant star suddenly collapses to a neutron star leaving the rest of stars to fall inwards and become explosively heated and ejected into space. In the great void between the stars there are vast clouds of gas and dust. A little of this material goes into making new stars. It is remarkable that in these clouds the existence of molecules of astonishing complexity has been detected. Some are so complex as to be classified as organic. The abundance of these molecules fundamentally incorporated into life on our planet (Earth) and possibly on other planets (like Kepler 22b) that are in the habitable zone, strongly suggests that the basis of life is universal. Sometimes in the religious and cultural arena wild claims are made without any scientific and logical basis. One such claim is an erroneous INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE 66 VOL. XXIX NO. 4 DECEMBER 2012</page><page sequence="7">UNIVERSAL PEACE THROUGH A BALANCE OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION doomsday theory that predicts that a supernova explosion in 2012 will harm life on Earth. However, astronomers are confident that this event will not prove detrimental for life on Earth, given the vastness of space and the long times between supernovae. It is estimated that on average, about one or two supernovae explode each century in our galaxy. It is estimated that for Earth's ozone layer to experience any damage from a supernova, the blast must occur less than 50 light years away and all the nearby stars capable of going supernova are much farther than this limit. Another explosive event known as a gamma ray burst (GRB) is often associated with supernovae. In the event of the collapse of a massive star in on itself or, less frequently, when two compact neutron stars collide, a black hole is born. Astronomers also estimate that a GRB is not likely to affect Earth. Therefore, religious leaders and scientists need to work together before promoting such apocalyptic theories. COMMENT There seems to be a general philosophical harmony in the cultural and social practices on our planet and minor variations in the practices that can be attributed to the geographical conditions, social history, and survival instincts. With the passage of time, as societies expand, the adventurous and aggressive nature of survival instincts has caused some nations to want to dominate other nations and their resources. In some cases individual leaders with unchecked power have ruled their countries on personal whims. These situations have caused conflicts between nations as well as among people within a nation. These unnecessary events cause the loss of human life and suffering of those who survive. Science, on the other hand, provides benefits applicable to everyone, although the available resources have caused differences in the extent of the use of different technologies. However, this gap is narrowing with the passage of time. God has provided adequate mental capacity to human beings to understand the complexities of the universe, when searched with a pure heart and clear mind. Science and religion are both seeking the same truth, though making use of different methodologies that approach truth from different perspectives. Both science and religion observe what is happening in the real world and try to explain the phenomena in their own language. Knowing this, they can INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXIX NO. 4 DECEMBER 2012 67</page><page sequence="8">UNIVERSAL PEACE THROUGH A BALANCE OF SCIENCE AND RELIGION both understand and appreciate each other's viewpoints and complement one another. Like the cooperation of the right and left hemispheres of the brain where there is no natural conflict, the two approaches to knowledge, intuitive and rational, religious and scientific, can work together for the welfare of the human race and earth's environment. One can argue that the event of the Big Bang and other commonly held scientific theories on the creation and existence of universe are noth ing short of mystical, even from the philosophical viewpoint of science. Regardless of how deeply scientists have probed our origins, they ultimately promote some unexplained source of the creation of universe and all natural events. Many scientific theories and concepts are yet to be experimentally confirmed, and good scientists are aware that these unknowns are akin to what religious philosophers call "God." With the confirmation, on 4th July, 2012, of existence of Higgs Boson (the God particle), which was proposed for the standard model, the cre ation of mass in the universe may become better understood. This is likely to affirm a greater unity of energy and matter universe. The NASA mission to Mars and the information transmitted, through the equipment fitted to the Curiosity Rover, might also assist in proposing that Mars, and not only Earth, might sustain living organisms. In future, the confirmation of life on other planets or in the outer space could become the basis for conflict between different civilizations in the universe. In order to face such challenges in the distant future, inhabitants of earth should start living peacefully with one another in the near future. In this manner, a culture of mutual respect and dignity to life is likely to develop, which would then assist in enhancing the attitude of living in harmony with other possible beings in the universe. The universe should be for assisting living and not for the destruction of one another. The things that humans cannot create, they have no right to destroy! Remember that everything that is born in the universe has to die, so why not live peacefully in harmony with others while we live? It is said that, "most beautiful and the most ugly; the intelligent and the stupid; the rich and the poor; the king and the ordinary person, have the same fate at death." How beautifully the Indian Saint Kabir has summarized the life on this planet: INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE 68 VOL.
