<plain_text><page sequence="1">274 Mark Hennelly Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve On January 8, 1852, Melville wrote a letter congratulating Sophia Hawthorne on finding a " subtile [.n'c] significance " in the " Spirit-Spout " chapter of Moby Dick: " But, then, since you, with your spiritualizing nature, see more things than other people, and by the same process, refine all you see, so they are not the same things that other people see, but things which while you think you but humbly discover them, you do in fact create them for yourself." 1 The modern reader of Moby Dick must follow the lead of Mrs. Hawthorne's " spiritualizing nature " and likewise attempt to " humbly discover " what Melville called the " part-8c-parcel allegoricalness of the whole." 2 The intent of this essay is to provide a psychoallegorical reading of the novel, not in terms of the mind that produced it,3 but rather in terms of the uniquely American consciousness and unconsciousness that Moby Dick dramatizes, especially with regard to the American male's " flight from woman." 4 iTfic Letters of Herman Melville, ed.

Lewis has coined and numerous subsequent commentators have helped to popularize has conditioned scholarly response toward the " light out for the Territory " mentality of Huck Finn and other national heroes, but has woefully disregarded the girl back-home in town or on shore. In a real sense, this lapse is the fault of the American writer and not critic; and yet the novelists usually do provide their heroes' (and in most cases also probably their own) neurotic, and often psychotic, concept of the " Ameri can Eve." 5 It is obviously impossible to account for, with any kind of psychological certainty, the exact reasons for the ambi guity of the feminine in the mind of the American male; how ever with the help of Melville's other works we can draw some reasonable conclusions. Europeans migrated to America for a number of reasons: religious persecution, penury, simply despair over an unsatis factory lifestyle, or more generally still, the need to escape a condition of guiltiness for a condition of guiltlessness. Through a number of subtle defense mechanisms, it seems the masculine psyche beheld the feminine as the source of much of this guilt. Moreover, the Manichean predisposition of the Puritan mind engendered a divided response which basically envisions the female as either a prostitute or a madonna, both of which as we shall see can evoke tremendous guilt from the male and both of which are further accentuated by the concurrent Oedipal syn drome which so often plagues the American Adam. As Freud implies, such a male becomes most seriously traumatized when he discovers both prostitute and madonna characteristics in the same woman,6 or metaphorically, when the hero confronts the simple reality that, in Melville's words, " truth is ever inco herent." 7 This relationship between sexual and epistemological wisdom is exemplified near the end of Mardi, when, after rehearsing the differences between the prostitute Hautia and the s I borrow the term from a former colleague, Barbara Ann Cicardo, in " The Mystery of the American Eve: Alienation of the Feminine as a Tragic Theme in American Letters," Diss.

For Melville, the wife usually reinforces this tension by becoming " some virago of an Amazon "9 who, as in " I and My Chimney," adamantly pits her " female jurisdiction " against the " masculine preroga tive." 10 Furthermore, and again partly due to the anti-sexual bias of Puritanism and its often resultant sexual inadequacy, the male exhibits a basic and guilt-provoking fear of sexuality itself. For example, the seductive American Eve, complete with rococo boudoir in " Fragments From a Writing-Desk No. 2," prompts her Adam to wimper: ". . . the kind and sympathizing reader will not wonder, when I wished myself bestowed in my own snug quarters in—Street." 11 Finally, for the American writer and Melville specifically, the feminine is many times peculiarly associated with the abuses of urban life, such as the degradation of slum conditions and the mechanical impersonality of indus trialism. The neophyte Redburn, for instance, encounters the problematic girl-of-the-streets theme when in Liverpool he discovers the unmarried Betsy Jennings and her two starving little girls as they grovel for garbage in a slum cellar. On the other hand, in the significantly titled " The Tartarus of Maids," the narrator finds an amalgam of the virgin and the dynamo at the paper factory; however rather than embroiling himself in social duty toward the oppressed maids, the shrinking male guiltlessly slips away to segregated Templar Bar, his " Paradise of Bachelors." The former tale which is located of course in New England and not England, illustrates a disturbing fact which the Ameri can Adam soon faced: America—New England—quickly became a mere extension of Europe—Old England; and the complexity of the feminine was just as guilt-provoking on this side of the 8 The Works of Herman Melville, Standard Edition, Reissued (New York: Russell and Russell, 1963), IV, 386. s " Fragments From a Writing-Desk No. 1," Standard Edition, XIII, 383. io Ibid., XIII, 291.

It is impossible to say how much frontier hardships adversely affected feminine hygiene or how completely twelve to fifteen hour work-days wore out the already strained sexual response of exhausted bodies; but this " Tartarus of Maids " depicting the horrors of gestation and the ominous " Black Notch " and " Blood River" 12 appears espe cially repulsive to Melville's young narrator. Likewise, the speaker suffering from postcoital depression in " After the Pleasure Party " laments that " never passion peace shall bring."13 Moreover, like Rip's shrewish wife, Dame Van Winkle, the American spouse could be just as much a virago as her European predecessor. In " I and My Chimney " she champions progress, change, and work over leisure: " Her maxim is, whatever is, is wrong; and what is more, must be altered; and what is more, must be altered right away." 14 Given these parameters of perception, it is little wonder that Melville's protagonists like " The Marquis De Grandvin " and "Jimmy Rose " are inveterate bachelors.15 The latter, for example, " is by nature a great ladies' man, and like most deep adorers of the sex, never tied up his freedom of general worship by making one wilful sacrifice of himself at the altar." 16 Consequently, once in America, the Adam displays a second set of withdrawal tendencies from those values which Melville in Moby Dick lists as " the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fire-side, the country." 17 The wish-fulfilling flight from these values may be geographic such as Huck's escape from Widow Douglas; or it may by psychic such as Tom Sawyer's " evasion " with Jim. However, usually it is both and suggests, again, a Rip Van Winkle regression from the complexity of the feminine and the guilt which it enfleshes and conversely an 12 Standard Edition, XII, 238. is " Poems," Standard Edition, XVI, 259. 14 Standard Edition, XIII, 288.

However, in Moby Dick the shadow-twins Ishmael and Ahab realize finally that they can no more escape the duality of the feminine than they can their own duality. It is only in this novel that Melville reconciles the castrating and Oedipal step mother of Ishmael's pivotal nightmare with the alma mater, Rachel. In order to understand the centrality of this changeling American Eve to " the part-&amp;-parcel allegoricalness of the whole " (indeed, on the surface the novel seems almost totally lacking in references to things feminine), we must trace her various mutations through the novel's structure, imagery, and characters. There are various ways to discuss the structural progression of the novel, all of which parallely suggest what Joyce means in Ulysses by at-onement through atonement: a well-integrated personality is achieved only by some sort of fortunate fall and consequent recovery. As Melville remarks in Pierre: " But it is through the malice of this earthly air, that only by being guilty of Folly does mortal man in many cases arrive at the perception of sense."18 Seasonally, for example, the action proceeds from the symbolic winter birth at Christmas to the warm rebirth of Ishmael from the summer waters of the Pacific. Geographically, this metaphoric movement is repeated in the voyage of the Pequod from the North Atlantic, " the tornadoed Atlantic of my being " (p. 499) which recalls the burdened male Titan, through the South Atlantic and North Pacific, and finally to the sinking and rebirth on the " Equator " midway between the North and South Pacific: "To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must ever after be the sea of his adoption" (p. 614). The logistics of this Odyssey, like that of the Ancient Mariner and the Poet-captain of Rimbaud's " Le Bateau Ivre " to name only a few such sailors, traverse the psychic seas from the home port of reason, through the southern climes of the unconscious, and return toward a reconciliation, at least psychologically speaking, in the " final waters " (p. 614) of 18 Standard Edition, IX, 233.</page><page sequence="6">Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve 279 some temperate zone. Along the voyage, of course, appropriate sea changes accompany each trial by water. However, the most comprehensive way to envision the structure of Moby Dick is through the latent content of Ishmael's portentous nightmare.19 The same kinds of death-in birth and birth-in-death motifs which we noticed in the seasonal pardigms reoccur in the oneiro-structure only in a much finer tone. But to begin with, the dream manifest.20 On the morning after Ishmael's first night at the Spouter-Inn, he wakes to find Queequeg hugging him with a " bridegroom clasp " (p. 54), as if " I had been his wife " (p. 52). This reminds him of a " somewhat similar circumstance " (ibid.) that occurred in a childhood nightmare and also subsequently gives the reader his only glimpse into Ishmael's past history. In the dream, Ishmael's stepmother who " was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless " (p. 53), " packed me off to bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June [sic], the longest day in the year in our hemisphere " (ibid.). His tres pass had been " trying to crawl up the chimney " (p. 52). Up stairs, he must abide " an undurable length of time [sixteen hours] " before he " could hope for a resurrection and so he tries everything possible " to kill time," including petitioning his " best and most conscientious of stepmothers " (ibid.) for a reprieve; but all fails. Finally, after having " fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; [sic] and slowly waking from it half steeped in dreams " (ibid.), he finds the " supernatural hand " of a " nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom " clutching his own which has been " hung over the counterpane " (ibid.). The Counterpane," significantly the title of the chapter and a visual cue for Ishmael, " was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-colored squares and triangles," mirroring Queequeg's arm, " tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one is For the surprisingly-little comment on this dream, see Arvin, p. 28, Pops, p. 82, and Fiedler, pp. 373-74. 20 Ishmael has some problem deciding " whether it was a reality or a dream " (p. 52) ; and the reader has a further problem deciding whether the " it " refers to the whole episode or only the "supernatural hand." To simplify matters, we are calling " it " a dream though in either case the wish- and fear-fulfilling nuances are the same. It should also be noted that the entire episode is qualified by hypothetical, " as-if " rhetoric.</page><page sequence="7">280 Mark Hennelly precise shade " (p. 52). For hours he lies there, " frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be broken " (p. 53). Ishmael concludes the episode by admitting: "... I lost myself in confounding at tempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle myself with it " (p. 54). Hopefully, our efforts can be more rewarding than Ishmael's; but to begin with we must list the significant detail resulting from his censor's power of distortion. In rough order these are: the stepmother, Ishmael's crime and punishment, the time of year and his whole attitude toward time in general, the hand, and finally the two external stimuli, Queequeg and the counterpane. All of these are of course intimately related in the specific dream-work. As far as his stepmother is concerned, Ishmael's epithet, "the best and most conscientious of step mothers " reveals the multi-leveled irony of the incest taboo. On the one hand, this taboo demands moral praise for the castrating mother (in this sense, the alter ego of his lost, ideal mother) whose punitive actions not only curb his regressive sexual desires but also simultaneously satisfy, up to the point of flagellation, his masochistic craving to be punished for the forbidden desires. On the other hand, she is the summa bona because the return to the mother's womb provides the passivity which Ishmael's narcissism seeks; while at the same time, since his desire must be unrequited, its object remains the immaculate madonna. Over and above all of this complexity, stands the American Eve's most therapeutic function, as far as the male is concerned, and that is as a gadfly to action, to the positive acceptance of secular time. Hester's stinging admonition to Dimmsdale in the forest (Chapter 17) most succinctly proclaims this role: " ' Preach! Write! Act! Do anything, save to lie down and die! ' " Again, it is Ishmael's task, as it was Dimms dale's in The Scarlet Letter, to understand all these protean dimensions of the feminine; and the Adam can accomplish this task only through mature involvement in the responsibilities of everyday existence.21 2i It should be remembered that a nightmare itself was originally a hag or witch who summoned bad dreams. Ishmael feels that the enigmatic seascape in the Spouter Inn, the first omen of Moby Dick, was painted " in the time of New England hags " (p. 36).</page><page sequence="8">Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve 281 With the Janus-faced identity of the American Eve exposed, the latent meaning of the dream begins to emerge. In order to grasp the significance of the chimney we need hardly be re minded of Freud's remark in The Interpretation of Dreams: " anyone, however, who has had a little experience in translating dreams will at once reflect that penetrating into narrow spaces . . . [is] among the commonest sexual symbols." 22 Moreover, Melville employed the chimney as Oedipal-fixation in more than one story, as for instance in " I and My Chimney " where it represents traditional masculine values and secrets for a whole line of New Englanders from the narrator back to his bachelor and pirate kinsman, Julian Dacres. Here, symbolizing the re turn to the mother's womb, it is obviously the husband's bul wark against his wife: "The truth is ... I and my chimney could not be parted." 23 Ishmael's crime, then, consists in attempting to regress into the pre-natal, timeless world of the womb. It is thus apropos that his punishment for trying " to kill time " is enduring " an undurable length of time " in the postpartum world of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year and also exactly the same time of year that the novel ends and Ishmael's " hope for a resurrection " is fulfilled. It is parallely remarkable that the dream is remembered very close to the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year when, as Ishmael computes it, it is " high time to get to sea as soon as I can " (p. 23). The mysterious hand which apparently concurs in the mother's prohibition and reinforces Ishmael's sentence in profane time belongs not to a Blakean Nobodaddy like Father Mapple's deity, " ' chiefly known to me by Thy rod ' " (p. 81), but to the humanistic father-ideal, an individuated American Adam who has worked by the sweat of his brow, shares the wisdom of his Eve, and has consequently regained Paradise. Both parents direct the neophyte along the correct path by providing him with the sacramental counterpane and the helper Queequeg with his " great skill in obstetrics " (p. 444), who has taught Ishmael the truth he must still earn for himself: " see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to 22 Trans, and ed. James Strachey (New York: Avon Books, 1965), p. 433. 28 Standard Edition, XIII, 298.</page><page sequence="9">282 Mark Hennelly bend them " (p. 87) .24 Moreover, Queequeg's non-Western epistemology embraces spontaneous, uninhibited sexuality; for example we learn of the marriage of his sister, " a pretty young princess just turned of ten " (p. 92). Like Huck's Jim, Queenqueg teaches Ishmael the therapy of going to orthodox hell: " ' We cannibals must help these Christians ' " (p. 96) ,25 Furthermore, Queequeg's tattooing resembles the counterpane and embodies " a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth " (p. 612). Ishmael's only caveat here is that he take Queequeg as a means and not an end, for Melville suggests that exclusive homosexuality and autoeroticism (perhaps part of the hand's prohibition) are only dodges to escape the American Eve. Thus Ishmael must beware both Queequeg's " bridegroom clasp " and masturbation-anxiety, the later self-" abandonment " of squeez ing sperm (pp. 531-32).26 However, if employed correctly, both guides in their motley and patchwork identity again reveal the overall lesson of Moby Dick, namely, as we have heard, " truth is ever incoherent." Consequently, like the Pequod balanced by the whale heads of Kant and Locke (p. 425), the mature American Adam perceives with what Melville calls the " equal eye " this combination [of intuition and scepticism] makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye " (p. 480). The serpent in this garden, the either—or myopia of the prostitute-madonna perspective, ap propriately must be crushed by a woman. The antipodal structure which the nightmare introduces (i.e., female commitment-male withdrawal, birth-death, finite time-eternity, tolerant relativism-prejudicial absolutism) is re flected and reinforced in the metaphoric scheme of the novel. The pertinent image-clusters are the specifically sexual, natural, and classical; while there is also relevant figurative content in the " gams " with other whalers. To begin with, and as Robert 24 For a discussion of the " helper " and the mythic hero, see Joseph Camp bell, Hero With A Thousand Faces (Cleveland and New York: Meridian Books, 1956), pp. 65-77. 26Anticipating Huck's "All right, then, I'll go to hell," (Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Chapter XXXI), Ishmael avows: " I must turn idolator " (p. 85). 28 I am grateful to Professor Harry Slochower for pointing out to me the element of masturbation-anxiety in Ishmael's nightmare.</page><page sequence="10">Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve 283 Schulman has observed,27 Melville supercharges with erotic energy a voyage seemingly-devoid of sexuality. Indeed, though the image patterns often overlap, the most common denomi nator is the sexual factor. It would appear that after abandon ing the American Eve on shore, the American Adam displaces all of his libido into the everyday tasks of whaling. For example the physical act of harpooning, "... when a subsequent gentle man reharpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman's property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her " (p. 508), and the more specific practice of pitchpoling (p. 474) both imply a kind of rape. Moreover, a great many metaphoric comparisons, if not blatantly sexual, rely upon a hidden sexual analogue. Tashtego fallen in the whale's head, for instance, recalls: "the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed " (p. 445). Significant here is the combination, again, of seductive and destructive elements, of the womb and the tomb. Through out Moby Dick the parallel epistemologies which prompt the return-to-the-womb and death wishes are illustrated by vaginal symbols such as the wheelbarrow, carpetbag, and chimney and by the coffin which appears on both the first and last pages among many others. Both types of analogous symbols are con sistently associated with Ishmael. They are matched by the masculine lance, or here harpoon, which however is only self annhilatory in the hands of lost, violent souls like Ahab and thus also leads to the tomb or "hearse " of American wood which Fedallah had prophesized.28 Natural imagery, especially external nature, animals, the sea, and meteorological phenomena, further exemplifies the n *' The Serious Function of Melville's Phallic Jokes," AL, 33 (1961), 179-94. Somewhat amusingly, at least one critic has been scandalized by Melville's sexual metaphors: " Ishmael has too deep a belly laugh for the crudities and obscenities that mark the animal life of man, making much more than is proper of some talk about men harpooning ladies . . See Walter E. Bezanson, " Moby Dick: Work of Art," In Moby Dick Centenial Essays, ed. Tyrus Hillway and Luther S. Mansfield (Dallas: Southern Methodist University Press, 1953), p. 39. 28 As many have noticed, the harpoon line which both strangles and drowns Ahab resembles an umbilical cord, and consequently the womb is also suggested here; see Slochower, p. 236.</page><page sequence="11">284 Mark Hennelly tendency of the American Adam to regard the female, and analogously reality itself, in either — or categories. Generally speaking, nature provides a refuge from the complexity of a both —and world: "Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone, he [the old bull whale] will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though she keeps so many moody secrets " (p. 505). Here it is significant of course that the wide-open-spaces become an ersatz wife for the archetypal Daniel Boone. As Melville knows and Ishmael discovers, how ever, nature's " many moody secrets," like those of " the best of wives," involve the ambiguity which combines the light " of the sun" with the "queen[ly];" "dark Hindoo half of nature" (p. 629). To mix metaphors as Melville often does, the mariners must remember his admonition in "Two Sides To A Tortoise" from The Encantadas: "Enjoy the bright, keep it turned up perpetually if you can, but be honest, and don't deny the black.... The tortoise is both black and bright." 29 And so, we might add, is The American Eve. Animal metaphors in Moby Dick invariably deal with the love-hate context of filial relationships. Sometimes the mother is a terrible one like Ishmael's own: " Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. . . . [thus] sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned " (p. 363). More normally, however, the maternal is benign, while the father exhibits Oedipal jealousy and revenge. Interestingly, the anthropomorphic sea lion dramatizes both of these relationships. Mother seals, for instance, anticipate the thematic role of the Rachel: " The rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her, crying and sobbing with a human sort of wail " (p. 661). On the other hand, Melville's simile comparing Ahab and a bull seal suggests the Oedipal commingling of fear and awe for the father, which 29 Standard Edition, X, 189.</page><page sequence="12">Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve 285 Freud expounds in Totem and Taboo: " Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned seal-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs " (p. 202). The sea, of course, provides the testing ground, the " ele mental strife at sea " (p. 169), for the Pequod's mythic journey. The lesson of the sea is by now all too familiar: . . when be holding the tranquil beauty and brillancy of the ocean's skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and would not willing remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a remorse less fang " (p. 623). The beast in this jungle, as another Amer ican Adam, James' John Marcher, must also learn, can be tamed only if one will admit its fearful symmetry, Melville's " Sym phony " combining the " gentle thoughts of the feminine air " and the "murderous thinkings of the masculine sea," which " though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and shadows without; these two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were, that distinguished them " (p. 681). There are a great many classical allusions in Moby Dick which serve to establish the mythological pedigree of the quest, relating the whalers to heroes of the past. But for our purpose, those allusions most pertinent are to Perseus, Narcissus, and Prometheus. Perseus, first of all, is generally most significant for placing the voyage in its proper psychological and mythic con text: " Everyone knows the fine story of Perseus and Andro meda: how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied on a rock on the seacoast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, in trepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid " (p. 466). An earlier reference, conversely, is to " Cellini's cast Perseus " (p. 168) which is a statue of the hero holding up the head of the gorgon, Medusa. Inherent in these twin exploits of Perseus are the prostitute (Medusa) madonna (Andromeda) symptoms of the American Adam; and Melville in fact calls the Greek heroes " antique Crockett [s] and Kit Carson [s] " (p. 468).30 Furthermore, the virgin-become-wife theme of the Andromeda tale suggests the vision the American so The actual reference here is to Hercules whom Melville sees as one in a long line of symbolic whalemen after Perseus.</page><page sequence="13">286 Mark Hennelly Adam earns after passing the tests, when maid and monster coalesce into wife, and ultimately male and female coalesce into human. In Melville's version of the Eden myth, the Adamic figure appears under two guises: one, like Narcissus is a spectator; the other, like Prometheus, is a participant. Actually both alter egos are dual manifestations of the American Self, divided between Ishmael and Ahab.81 We shall observe this gemination in more detail in our discussion of the two characters; here we need only regard the classical prototypes. Narcissus, the analogue of Ish mael, is seduced by his self-reflection which, as we have heard, is called " the image of the ungraspable phantom of life " (p. 26). In psychological terms, Narcissus' rejection of Echo and sub sequent love for his water-image is essentially an Oedipal act in which mature interpersonal love is rejected for an incestuous vision of oneself in a symbolic womb. His shadow-figure Prome theus, on the other hand, like Ahab (p. 272), withdraws from mature intersexual contact by devoting himself to a mono maniacal cause, either selfish or messianic, which while liberat ing is also escapist. The object of mythological or mythic quests is normally therapeutic for the questors; and here the whales, and especially Moby Dick, are no exception. Like Faulkner's Bear, the whales represent the androgynous mystery32 and are invariably de scribed in parental or sexual terms. The tail of these " pre adamite " and " antemosaic " (pp. 581-82) creatures, for exam ple, combines " maidenly gentleness " with the phallic " pre hensile power ... of Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsals, and then caressed their zones " (pp. 483-84). The most comprehensive account of cetacean private life occurs in " The Grand Armada " where " Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan amours in the deep " as well as " long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame Leviathan, by which the young 31 See Thomas Woodson's account of these allusions in " Ahab's Greatness: Prometheus as Narcissus," ELH, 33 (1966), 351-69. 32 For concurring evaluations of Moby Dick, see Arvin, p. 173, Slochower, pp. 234 ff. and Pops, p. 87.</page><page sequence="14">Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve 287 cub seemed still tethered to its dam " (p. 498). In view of this, if the crew can reconcile the Good Mother with the primal scene, then it will also be able to practice a faith which stresses the broadening vision of the fortunate fall and not, like Father Mapple's, the restrictive awesomeness of God's power. Moby Dick itself is not only a kind of totemic nature-god (:nature in the sense of the ambiguity we have witnessed before); but it is also the incarnation of Ishmael's nightmare. To begin with, though, the White Whale, like its less exalted brethren, evokes the mingled hostility and desire of the primal scene: " Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with the ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleet ness, rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so divinely swam " (p. 690). Here Moby Dick is almost a kind of sacramental, an outward sign pointing toward the duality of Europa, " ravished " and " maid." As deity also, however, the whale, again like Faulkner's Old Ben, embodies the temporal and eternal: " Moby Dick [is] not only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time) " (p. 244).33 In its concern with time, Moby Dick furthermore be comes the " silent form or phantom " foretold in Ishmael's dream. Thus it is called both " the gliding demon of the seas of life " (p. 251) and one " of those far mysteries we dream of, . . . that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims before all human hearts " (p. 316). Finally, this Caucasian whale bears the pigment of the American Adam; and symbolizing the father of the nightmare, it is not only Ishmael's guide but also the model he must strive after. Like all complex symbols, for example the Doubloon, Moby Dick is different things to different people and all these things at once; and thus it reflects again that " truth is ever incoherent." Although the gams do not inclusively announce the ambi guity of the American Eve, these meetings, for example, the polarizing Jungfrau and Bachelor, do reflect many of the con 33 Though Melville declares this is the " superstition " of the whalers, his own dramatization clearly coincides with this superstition.</page><page sequence="15">288 Mark Hennelly cerns we have been discussing. However, for brevity's sake, the last two gams seem most pertinent. The significance of the Samuel Enderby and its one-armed Captain is quite complex, and to understand its importance we must backtrack to Peter Coffin and his family. When Peter offers a bed to Ishmael (who later there shares Queequeg's " bridegroom clasp "), he also relates the bed's pedigree: " ' Sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty room for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do ' " (p. 45). The real nature of the " ' dreaming and sprawling ' " is of course left in doubt; but the general context of the situation seems to suggest the primal scene, the aftereffect of which was the symbolic castration of Sam. This mayhem is revisited upon a second Sam, " ' Sammy ' " (p. 562), the Samuel Enderby, whose Captain is similarly maimed by the incarnation of the dream, Moby Dick. Again, then, the realization of the American Eve as both mother and sexual object fragments the American Adam. Finally, the ambivalent Rachel reconciles these roles—at least for Ishmael. Initially, the whaler is hermaphroditic since it not only repre sents " Rachel, weeping for her lost children, because they were not " (p. 671), but also contains a Captain who has lost his pubes cent son to the principle of individuation, Moby Dick: " a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the earnest but un misgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer's parental love, had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a voca tion almost immemorially the destiny of all his race " (p. 670). At the novel's conclusion, not only is a surrogate son found in Ishmael, but also the prostitute Pequod, that " fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata Morgana [Morgan Le Fay] " (p. 722), is replaced by the true American Eve, both " devious " and ma ternal, " the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing children, only found another orphan " (p. 724, italics Melville's). As for the characters, besides Sally Coffin and the wish-ful filling Polynesian " brides " aboard the Bachelor, the only</page><page sequence="16">Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve 289 females that appear on stage are Mrs. Hosea Hussey and Aunt Charity. Of the two, Aunt Charity is the American beau ideal of the maternal: " And like a sister of charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, com fort, and consolation to all on board ..." (pp. 138-39). Further more, her repressive tendencies are clearly implied as she places "a small copy of Watts['] " hymns and psalms "in each sea man's berth " (p. 144) and smuggles ginger on board to replace the harpooners' whiskey (p. 419). Mrs. Hussey, on the other hand, is a more realistic, kindly termagant who is not only sexual (as her name suggests) but also both castrating and nourishing. Outside of her boarding house, the Try Pots, hang " Two enormous wooden pots painted black " (p. 99), an appar ent castration symbol. Moreover, she doesn't allow harpoons in the bedrooms (p. 102), further suggesting the shackling of the phallic power. Still, she nourishes the mariners with her famous clam and cod chowder (Chapter XV)34 and thus becomes the only actual American Eve in the novel. Like the Pequod itself, the male characters in Moby Dick, each represent an epistemological position somewhere between Locke and Kant, that is, somewhere between the empiricism of Ahab and the idealism of Ishmael. However, like those two other prototypical representatives of Western Man, Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedelus,35 the quest of each crew member si These may even be sexual symbols connoting female and male qualities respectively, and thereby indicating her androgynous nature. 85 Lest such analogies with Joyce, Blake, or other Western but non-American writers confuse the reader, let me stress again that this syndrome of attitudes toward the feminine is not restrictively an American characteristic but is dis played generally in the Western male psyche. However, as we have seen, the American biases seem further reinforced, probably due to such complex na tional phenomena as the frustration of the original flight from woman, the frontier ethic, Puritanism, and the relative youthfulness of the country. For general analyses of the feminine (all, unfortunately by male commentators), see Stern; C. J. Jung, Symbols of Transformation, trans, R.F.C.

Abrams, Natural Supernaturalism (New York: W. W. Norton and Co., Inc., 1971), p. 165.</page><page sequence="17">290 Mark Hennelly can attain success only in the common acceptance of the female principle. In this sense, as Joyce notes, everyman is " Blephen Stoom." Or as Melville notes through Ahab: " ' Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind . . . ' " (p. 697). Or again even more explicitly: " They were one man, not thirty ... all the individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness [«c], all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their lord and keel did point to" (pp. 700-01). For example, those two representative American ancient mariners, the Car penter and the Blacksmith, both betray symptomatic misogyny. The former flees from " ' lonely widow women ashore ' " be cause " ' they might take it into their lonely old heads to run off with me ' " (p. 633). The Job-like Blacksmith, on the other hand, a shattered mirror-image of Ahab, escapes responsibility for the death of his " youthful, daughter-like, loving wife " (p. 617) by heeding the guilty voice of his own soul projected upon the mermaids: " ' Come hither, broken hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death . . . put up thy gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till we marry thee! ' " (pp. 617-18). Like Hawthorne's Puritans who " have lost the forgotten art of gaiety " (Scarlet Letter, Chapter 21) these Quakers exhibit "a half wilful overruling morbid ness at the bottom of... [their] nature " (p. 111). And it is only the true American Eve who can unlock the imprisoned repres sions of their souls, who can give them the " equal eye." However the strains of idealism and scepticism, of the womb and the tomb, are most loudly announced by those two polarized Doppels, Ishmael and Ahab, whose common flight from woman gives both structure and substance to Moby Dick. The first half of this divided self, Ishmael, we have already treated quite extensively in our discussion of Narcissus and the pivotal nightmare. In rejecting the ship Devil-Dam after he " peered and pryed about" (p. 104) her, Ishmael reiterates his intended escape from the dark side of the female personality.86 3« See also p. 32 where Ishmael similarly evades inns whose names are blatantly phallic, e.g., " The Sword-Fish " and " The Crossed Harpoons." Such symbols, as we have seen, are associated with Ahab; Ishmael's emblems are the securely-feminine chimney, carpetbag, and wheelbarrow.</page><page sequence="18">Ishmael's Nightmare and The American Eve 291 Moreover, the return-to-the-womb dimensions of his narcissistic retreat to the Great Mother, the sea, are so clearly defined for Ishmael during his reverie on the mast-head " that at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him the embodiment of the elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it" (p. 214). This revisitation by the " silent form or phantom " of his nightmare is significant since Ishmael must remember that for salvation he has to simply accept that " truth is ever incoherent." Like Narcissus he will be damned if he allows the mystery to tease him out of thought: " And still deeper [is] the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned " (p. 26). Like Ishmael, Ahab has lost his real mother, in Peleg's words a " ' crazy, widowed mother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old,' " (p. 119); and he was also apparently cared for by a second mother, " ' the old squaw Tis tig ' " who prophe sized that no good would come of him (ibid.). However, unlike Ishmael, Ahab has not totally retreated from feminine contact but married (p. 683); and this union, echoing that of the Biblical Ahab and Jezebel,37 seems to have been as traumatic as the Black smith's. In describing the self-imposed seclusion of the Amer ican Adam, Ahab inadvertently reveals the antifeminine motiva tion behind his loneliness: " ' When I think of the life I have led; the desolation and solitude it has been; the masoned, walled town of a Captain's exclusiveness, which admits but small en trance to any sympathy from the green country without—. . . away, whole oceans away, from the young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage pillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her... ' " (p. 683). Still, as Ahab admits to the diabolic corpusants, the key to his personality and by implication to his inability to love maturely is locked in his mother-fixation: 37 See Franklin, p. 70 for a discussion of the Biblical allusion.</page><page sequence="19">292 Mark Hennelly thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know not. Oh, cruel! what has thou done with her? There lies my puzzle ' " (p. 643). This unmistakable reference to an unresolved Oedipal complex explains " ' the queenly personality [which] lives in me, and feels her royal rights ' " (p. 641). This " ' queenly per sonality ' " drives the Cain-like Ahab in a much more active, Promethean way, than it does Abel-Ishmael; and it demands the capture of Moby Dick which, for Ahab, in its ambiguity is not only the primal beast-with-two-backs and his castrating father but also his " ' sweet mother ' " with whom he can finally retie the umbilical harpoon rope. Consequently, this " mono maniacal old man " (p. 677), symbolically castrated with an "all but pierced ... groin" (p. 590), has " a stick of a whale's jaw-bone for a wife " (p. 601) and thus no chance for the comprehensive vision of the " equal eye." The object of a psychomachia be tween the satanic Fedallah and the wife-loving Starbuck (pp. 685-86), Ahab loses his soul to the forces of either—or evil. Thus, and to return to the beginning, although Moby Dick in Melville's mind is " by no means the sort of book for " 38 women, he still believes that Mrs. Hawthorne, with her " spirit ualizing nature, [which] see[s] more than other people," is perhaps its most perceptive early reader. Persumably, this is because only an American woman could really appreciate the fact that " truth is ever incoherent " in the form that Melville chose to dramatize it. That the maternal American Eve indeed holds the ultimate secret to life's mythic round from innocence through experience to wisdom we discover not only from the " devious-cruising Rachel " but also, finally, from Melville's own unabashed proclamation: There is no steady retracing progress in this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one pause: —through infancy's unconscious spell, boyhood's thought less faith, adolescence' [stc] doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood's pondering repose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor ss Letters, p. 138.

In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling's father hidden? Our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it (p. 624). The " part-&amp;-parcel allegoricalness of the whole " dovetails finally with the womb and the tomb of the American Eve.39 Mark Hennelly, Ph.D. California State University 6000 J Street Sacramento, Calif. 95819 Mark Hennelly, 88 After the original writing of this manuscript, I came across the following valuable study of the flight from woman theme: Wolfgang Lederer, M.D., The Fear of Women (New York and London: Grune and Stratton, 1968).</page></plain_text>
