He has lately got a piece of moder nity from England which I am afraid will fatigue and exhaust him more than all the Volcanos and antiquities in the Kingdom of Naples. —James Byres to the Bishop of Killala, 14 June 17861 The "piece of modernity" in question was Emma Hart, formerly Emily Hart, formerly Emy Lyon, recently arrived in Naples after having been dispatched from London by her erstwhile protector Charles Gre ville in an attempt to exchange the financial burdens of supporting her for the financial rewards that might accrue from a lucrative marriage. The marriage Greville anticipated for himself did not take place; the one he never contemplated did, though, as Emma became the wife of his uncle William Hamilton on September 6, 1791. In so doing, she, whom nephew had dangled before uncle as "a modern piece of virtu,"2 one more beautiful item to add to Hamilton's antiquarian collections, be came more than just a companion whose status had been sanctioned legally and whose name could be prefaced with the title "Lady."

REMAKES, OUTTAKES, AND UPDATES IN SUSAN SONTAG'S THE VOLCANO LOVER Stacey Olster</page><page sequence="2">118 Mfs came the heroine of a romance, peculiarly modern perhaps in that her virtue did not hinge on her virginity (which was long lost), but certainly ro mantic in that the wedding between low-born servant girl and plenipo tentiary of British royalty both confirmed the prospects presented in Pamela's fiction and anticipated those socially unequal liaisons, such as that between William Randolph Hearst and Marion Davies, that later would occur in fact. (And that was before Nelson ever entered the picture.) That Byres, an art dealer, should refer to Emma as a "piece of modernity" in particular is most appropriate when considering Susan Sontag's re-telling of her story in The Volcano Lover, for Sontag-from whose vocabulary the word "postmodernism" is noticeably absent-pro fesses that "most everything we think of as natural is historical and has roots—specifically in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, the so called Romantic revolutionary period" (Cott 49), the very period during which the marriage between Emma and Hamilton and her subse quent affair with Horatio Nelson took place. But that Byres's fears should focus on the possible exhaustion that Hamilton's piece of moder nity might exact upon a significantly older benefactor unintentionally raises questions about literary exhaustion-a distinctly postmodern con cern-with respect to any contemporary re-telling of the story of the Hamiltons and Lord Nelson as a romance, to cite the subtitle that Son tag appends to her historical novel. Such distinctly postmodern concerns about literary exhaustion, moreover, are not the only ones that link Sontag to a cultural phenom enon she never identifies by name. Admittedly, different postmod ernisms exist for different postmodernist commentators (the, by now, de rigueur caveat by which the work of each is prefaced); that being the case, many of Sontag's remarks nevertheless conform to almost every defining element upon which commentators agree as basic assumptions. Her evolutionary conception of aesthetic forms, in which "exhausted" forms are periodically "replaced by new forms which are at the same time anti-forms" (Against Interpretation 180), actually predates John Barths 1967 and 1980 pronouncements on exhaustion and replenish ment respectively. Her rejection of grand narratives, whether exempli fied in the myth imposed by Lévi-Strauss upon all cultures over all times or the single scenario by which the North Vietnamese understand their entire history (Against Interpretation 79; Radical Will 219), is no different from Lyotard's repudiation of totalizing systems. Her view of images that</page><page sequence="3">Olster 119 displace the reality of their referents, as illustrated by photography's "hyping up the real" (On Photography 169), virtually duplicates Bau drillard's simulacra (not to mention his wording). And if her tracing the production of those images within advanced industrial societies does not duplicate Fredric Jameson's wording in quite the same manner (he would prefer multinational), her proposing that "freedom to consume a plurality of images and goods is equated with freedom itself" (On Pho tography I78-179) as the ideological upshot of a proliferation of images corresponds completely with his diagnosis.3 Why then the confusion among literary critics, who designate Sontag as, alternately, late modernist and early postmodernist? Part, no doubt, is attributable to Sontag's refusal to strait-jacket her conception of the modern-the word she typically employs when delineating the qualities listed above-to a single chronological period. In contrast to a theorist like Jameson, who derives postmodernism's historical .situation from its multinationalism being the cultural dominant of "our own pe riod" (36), Sontag conceives different cultures experiencing the histori cal conditions that promote particular kinds of art at different chrono logical times. Yet far more categoric confusion, I would argue, results from that admiration of the artist/auteur's will and insistence on the work of art's autonomy that signal, particularly in Sontag's early writings, the lingering perspective of the aesthete who adamantly rejects all no tions of "putting art to use" and whose anti-interpretive refusal to "dig 'behind' the text, to find a sub-text" presumes that texts are best expe rienced as ends in themselves rather than as ideologically constructed (Against Interpretation 21,6). The importance of a later work like The Volcano Lover thus derives, in large part, from the way it directly addresses Sontag's straddling of the modernist/postmodernist divide. Framed with respect to cinematic techniques, yet always aware of the moral element inherent in choosing different forms of representational media, Sontag's recycling the story of the Hamilton-Nelson triangle as a historical novel yields a perfect exam ple of the kind of self-reflexive postmodern novel that Linda Hutcheon has dubbed historiographie metafiction ( 14). At the same time, Sontag's dubbing that same historical novel a romance recycles a narrative form whose representation of an idealized world in which "all the arts and adornments of language are used to embellish the narrative," to quote Robert Scholes and Robert Kellogg (14), "signifies a fiction composed</page><page sequence="4">120 Mfs by an individual author for esthetic ends" (248)-a narrative, in other words, perfectly suited to the modernist in Sontag who began her ca reer advancing the priority of form over content. As Gillian Beer has pointed out, however, the romance is not quite as "esthetic" a production as Scholes and Kellogg presume. While the idealized world presented in romance "is never fully equivalent to our own," it nevertheless "must remind us of it if we are to understand it at all" (3)-and for the very didactic purposes of instruction. (After all, once Nelson enters the picture, Emma Hamilton's story shifts from a chronicle of upward mobility to a testament to the folly of flouting social conventions.) As a result, in choosing a form with such an implicit utili tarian component, Sontag provides not just a postmodern parody of an earlier admonitory tale, she provides a postmodern parody of her own early aesthetic pronouncements. Previews "The Romance is an heroic fable, which treats of fabulous persons and things.-The Novel is a picture of real life and manners, and of the times in which it is written," wrote Clara Reeve in The Progress of Ro mance (1785). Continuing with this line of thought, she went on to dis tinguish between the two literary forms on the basis of the approxima tion of verisimilitude each provided: The Romance in lofty and elevated language, describes what never happened nor is likely to happen.-The Novel gives a fa miliar relation of such things, as pass every day before our eyes, such as may happen to our friend, or to ourselves; and the perfection of it, is to represent every scene, in so easy and natural a manner, and to make them appear so probable, as to deceive us into a persuasion (at least while we are read ing) that all is real, until we are affected by the joys or dis tresses, of the persons in the story, as if they were our own. (Ill) As Reeve also admitted, such neat distinctions did not apply quite so well in an age of "modern Romances" that "were written with more regularity, and brought nearer to probability," having "tak[en] for their foundation some obscure parts of true history, and building fictitious</page><page sequence="5">Olster 121 stories upon them," to the extent that "truth and fiction were so blended together, that a common reader could not distinguish them" (64-65). Reeve was not alone in her concern. Distinguishing between those recent works of fiction he termed "comed[ies] of romance" and those earlier works of Knight-Errantry he called "heroic romance[s]," Samuel Johnson warned of the imprudent messages that the modern in carnations could send to their readers: In the romances formerly written, every transaction and sen timent was so remote from all that passes among men, that the reader was in very little danger of making any applications to himself; the virtues and crimes were equally beyond his sphere of activity But when an adventurer is levelled with the rest of the world, and acts in such scenes of the universal drama, as may be the lot of any other man; young spectators fix their eyes upon him with closer attention, and hope by ob serving his behaviour and success to regulate their own prac tices, when they shall be engaged in the like part. (67, 69) The solution was not to dispense with romance, however, but to employ romance for purposes of moral education, for "under proper restrictions and regulations they will afford much useful instruction, as well as rational and elegant amusement" (Reeve xvi). Thus, Johnson ad vised careful selection of material, based on his belief that an awareness of the excellence of art imitating nature should be tempered by an awareness of which parts of nature were most worthy of being imitated (70). Yet far from such strictures being an imposition upon romance, they in many ways just made more explicit the duties that were always implicit in a genre that, for all the temporal or social distance separating its stories from their audiences, was allusive from the very beginning. As Gillian Beer notes, "[t]he romance tends to use and re-use well-known stories whose familiarity reassures" in such a way that "remote sources are domesticated and brought close to present experience primarily because they are peopled with figures whose emotions and relation ships are directly registered and described with profuse sensuous detail" (2), with results of which Doctor Johnson would most certainly have ap proved: "Because romance shows us the ideal it is implicitly instructive as well as escapist" (9). Particularly illustrative of this instructive component of romance is</page><page sequence="6">122 Mfs the most familiar precursor of Sontag's own re-telling of the Hamilton Nelson triangle, Alexander Korda's That Hamilton Woman (1941, re leased in England as Lady Hamilton), which, for all its director's empha sizing amorous passion as defining his principal characters' desires while filming ("Vincikém," he reputedly admonished his set designer brother upon viewing the lavish library constructed for Lord Hamilton's home in Naples, "it's a love story. I can't shoot it in a bloody library. Make me a bedroom!" [Korda 150; Walker 152]), was intended from its inception as a piece of propaganda to mobilize support for Britain during World War II. (As Korda informed his screenwriters, "Propaganda needs sugar coating" [Edwards 127].) Suggested as a subject in 1940 by Winston Churchill, who was interested in a vehicle that would promote Britain's historic role as a scourge of tyrants (Hitler here equated with Bona parte); funded by Korda himself, who had been secretly serving as a courier for transatlantic messages and whose New York City offices were already supplying cover to MI-5 agents gathering intelligence on both German activities in the United States and isolationist sentiments among makers of American foreign policy; and starring Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, who were interested in quick cash to stabilize their fi nances in order to evacuate their respective children from Britain for the remainder of the war, the movie repeatedly sacrifices the passion of romantic love in order to send the message that "England expects that every man will do his duty," as the sails raised prior to the Battle of Trafalgar signal. And not only men, as it turns out. "Well, we both have our duty, haven't we?" says Alan Mowbray's doddering William Hamilton to his wife, when asking her to convince Nelson of her imminent move to Cairo so that he will return to London as ordered by the Admiralty. "I feel it my duty to tell you of these things," says Nelson to the Admiralty officers, when imploring them to convince the prime minister not to rat ify any peace plan with Napoleon. So clearly, in fact, did the film send its message about the need for continued vigilance against the threat of "men who for the sake of their insane ambition want to destroy what other people build," so loudly did it proclaim the centuries-old role of Britain (a "tiny little bit," as Emma says, when first shown its position on the globe) in maintaining a Commonwealth "in which every little spot has its purpose and value to the balanced line of life" against "madmen" who "want to get hold of the whole world" and "dictate their will to</page><page sequence="7">Olster 123 others," that it became Exhibit A in a case brought against Korda by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Committee had accused him of operating an espionage and propaganda center for Britain in the United States-a charge Korda only escaped by virtue of the fact that his scheduled appearance before the committee on December 12, 1941 was preempted by the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor five days ear lier (Holden 166).5 This is not the movie scenario viewers remember, of course, no more than they remember the film's peculiar abstemiousness that quali fies, if not condemns, the very lushness its romantic surroundings are meant to herald: a Nelson who renounces the Neapolitan fete held in his honor as a "tragic carnival" of "paper caps and toy balloons," an Emma who replaces banana curls and oversized white hats with sensible dark clothes and embroidery hoops. That viewers remember a love story is due to the fact that the real romance involved in the film's pro duction occurred off-screen, between two actors (who had just com pleted a run of Romeo and Ju//et-another real romance-just prior to the start of filming), each married to another person, who in having "loved before their time," to quote Life magazine (20 May 1940), had entered the pantheon of "great American lovers-the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, John Barrymore and Elaine Barrie, and John Smith and Poca hontas" (Vickers 128). It did not matter that the two actors in question had obtained their respective divorces and married in secret before production began, for it was the image of two adulterous actors playing two adulterous historical figures that lent the movie the aura of romance that is now remembered. According to Sontag, such a sentimental residue is, in part, a func tion of film's being the artistic medium "most heavily burdened with memory," so much so that "practically all films older than four or five years are saturated with pathos" (Radical Will 113, 114). In even greater part, it testifies to the substitution of image for actuality that Sontag, cit ing the 1843 preface to the second edition of Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity, sees as forming "a widely agreed-on diagnosis" of a soci ety's modernity (On Photography 153). Just how relativistic that diagnosis is to different societies and different times, however, is suggested by the particularly heavy burden of cinematic imagery with which Sontag has to contend in The Volcano Lover, for Korda's version was not the only movie made of the Hamilton-Nelson affair. Preceding and succeeding it</page><page sequence="8">124 Mfs were so many celluloid versions of Lady Hamilton's story produced in so many countries as to make Emma an international commodity: Malvina Longfellow in Nelson and The Romance of Lady Hamilton (Great Britain, 1918 and 1919), Liane Haid in The Affairs of Lady Hamilton (Germany, 1921 ), Gertrude McCoy in Nelson (Great Britain, 1926), Corinne Grif fith in The Divine Lady (USA, 1929), Michele Mercier in Lady Hamilton (West Germany, Italy, France, USA, 1969), and Glenda Jackson in Be quest to the Nation (Great Britain, 1973) (Pickard 91 -92). Representing the romance of Lady Hamilton and Lord Nelson in a contemporary novel thus means representing an image of an image of an image ad in finitum, the cumulative burdens of which Sontag portrays in the deliber ately hyperbolic rhetoric she chooses to delineate the most clichéd (and hence parodied) feature of her narrative, the volcano itself: "a mon strous living body, both male and female," "an abyss," "[a] constant menace," "[t]he slumbering giant that wakes," "[t]he lumbering giant who turns his attentions to you" (5-6). This is not to suggest that Sontag reduces her historical person ages to celluloid phantasms and their ménage to mirage. "The question is never whether the events of the past actually took place," Linda Hutcheon remarks in an important qualification: The past did exist-independently of our capacity to know it. Historiographie metafiction accepts this philosophically realist view of the past and then proceeds to confront it with an anti-realist one that suggests that, however true that inde pendence may be, nevertheless the past exists for us-now only as traces on and in the present. The absent past can only be inferred from circumstantial evidence. (73) And the evidence in question, as Sontag's inclusion of letters and other written documents attests, is specifically textual. Therefore, while Son tag's deconstructed rendering of a bloated and boozy Emma may result in a more accurate Emma, in that it corresponds more closely to the Emma described by those of her time as "a dull creature" (Goethe 316) and "terribly fat" (Vigée Lebrun 68), it does not (and cannot) arrive at a truthful Emma because the evidence upon which she bases her own portrait is itself compromised. In the case of Emma in particular, more than human bias con tributes to that compromised quality of her representations. "Few ever</page><page sequence="9">Olster 125 see what is not already inside their heads," Sontag writes in her novel (56), and Emma was very much in the heads of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Europe. ("She is becoming a local marvel with an international reputation, like the volcano" [137].) Having been painted or drawn by George Romney, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West, John Raphael Smith, Gavin Hamilton, Frederick Rehberg, Louise-Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, Dominique Vivant De Non, Constantina Coltellini, Henry Fuseli, Thomas Lawrence, Jean Baptiste Monnoyer, Wilhelm Tischbein, Angelica Kaufmann, and James Masquerier; and having in those pictures incarnated such varied figures from history, myth, and literature as Joan of Arc, Magdalen, St. Cecilia, Nature, Circe, Medea, Agrippina, Thetis, Calypso, Hebe, Sibyl, Ariadne, innumerable Bacchanates, Shakespeare's Miranda and Constance, Goethe's Iphigenia, and William Hayley's The Triumph of Temper heroine Serena, Emma as visual image was very much in the heads of Europeans at that time, and often prior to her arrival on the Continent. "Hers was the beauty he had adored on canvas, as a statue, on the side of a vase," muses Hamilton, referred to throughout the novel as the Cavaliere, who has himself contributed to the advance of Emma's image by commissioning a portrait of her from Reynolds: "Nothing had ever seemed to him as beautiful as certain objects and images-the reflection, no, the memorial, of a beauty that never really existed, or existed no longer. Now he realized the images were not only the record of beauty but its harbinger, its forerunner" (130). Thus, Son tag amends Feuerbach's conception of a modern age's preference for "the image to the thing, the copy to the original" and presents her own version of Baudrillard's précéssion of simulacra that precedes even Bau drillard's conceptualization:6 because notions of reality change as cer tainly as notions of image, the "true modern primitivism," in her view, "is not to regard the image as a real thing," but to define what is real to the degree that it conforms to the visual image that precedes it" (On Photography 153, 161). To put it another way, when the time comes for Emma to sit as portrait subject instead of portrait model, as occurs with Romney's painting her as The Ambassadress in 1791, there is no Emma left to paint, for, as Romney's Sitters's Diaries show, even the image of Emma married to the Ambassador to the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies precedes her actual marriage to him, the nuptials in question taking place on the third day after her sittings begin ( 177; Great Britain Arts Council 45).</page><page sequence="10">126 Mfs When Sontag then writes that Emma "does not know who she is anymore, but she knows herself to be ascending" ( 134), she describes not just the indeterminate subject of postmodern writing, as the appar ent ease of the actual Emma's changes of name might indicate (height ened in Sontag's book by the character's remaining without any name until the last page), but the overdetermined subject. Even her transfor mation is depicted with respect to an old familiar story-"Pygmalion in reverse" ( 144). Any "ascension" Emma undergoes is simply a function of having replaced less reputable artistic transposers, like London sex ther apist Doctor Graham, in whose tableaux vivants she models at fifteen, with more reputable ones, like society portrait painter George Romney, for whom she begins posing two years later ( 146). Perhaps more to the point, any "ascension" Emma undergoes proves to be short-lived in the extreme, as renderings of the actual historical figure confirm, for at the same time that her body begins to expand, her images start to shrink-from early canvases of her in classical dress (95" x 80-1 /2" for Romney's Thetis, 53" x 62" for Vigée-Lebrun's Bacchante, 51 " x 38" for Hamilton's Sibyl), to later likenesses of Emma as herself both anatomized (Joseph Nellekens's 22-15/16"-high marble bust, Thomas Laurence's 7 7/8" x 6" penciled head) and miniaturized (Henry Bone's 3-1/2" x 3" ivory). Indeed, so many representations of her begin to appear (a I -3/8" enamel brooch in Napless De Ciccio Collection), or are alleged to ap pear (the figure of Hope on the Duke of Clarence's porcelain dinner service), and in so many different mediums (a 3-1/4" x 2-1/2" tortoise shell snuff box with miniature ivory inset) that all sense of her unique ness vanishes.7 No longer an artifact of high culture, but available to all through mass merchandising, she becomes easily disposable, as in fact happens when she dies in Calais, penniless and indolent. Freeze-Frames The paradigm in Sontag's book for the transformation that Emma undergoes is the transformation of Hamilton's Portland Vase into Etruria Ware at the hands of Josiah Wedgwood, an emblematizing that Sontag highlights through an anthropomorphic rendering of the vase with respect to features of human anatomy. The process delineated is the one sketched by Walter Benjamin concerning the fate of a work of art in an age of mechanical reproduction, and the lesson taught applies</page><page sequence="11">Olster 127 as much to the romantic form in which Sontag works as it does to the g image of the romantic figure at its center: Some twenty replicas of the midnight-blue glass vase were made in smooth black stoneware-the industrial potter and professed lover of simplified forms was to consider it his mas terpiece. Wedgwood did not even attempt to match the color or patina of the original and, by simplifying, vitiated its aristocratic contours. The vase's handles lean inward instead of following the curve of the body, the shoulders are more rounded, the neck is shortened. Perhaps the Cavaliere found the slightly dumpy rendering acceptable, having long ago overcome any patrician resistance to this new, mercantile way of spreading the influence of his collections. But he would surely have been startled by the progeny of the vase that the Wedgwood firm began turning out by the tens of thousands in the next century. Olive-green, yellow, pale pink, lilac, lavender-blue, grey, black, and brown Portland vases; Portland vases in many sizes, including small, medium, and large. Everyone could have, should have a Portland vase-and however desired: that was the company's plan. It grew, it shrank, it could be any color. The vase became a notion, a tribute to itself Who can really love the Portland Vase now? ( 137-138) According to Donald Barthelme, who portrayed the per-capita production of trash as increasing over the years, the question was moot; with production approaching the one hundred percent mark, disposal of trash was impossible and appreciation inevitable (97). Sontag concurs, if for slightly different reasons. Inheriting an aesthetic artifact that so epitomizes all those overstylized "derelict, inane, démodé objects of modern civilization" enables Sontag to treat it as an artifact of Camp, to be dismembered as part of her long-standing Surrealist program of "cultural disburdenment" and then reassembled with the aim of "de stroying conventional meanings, and creating new meanings or counter meanings through radical juxtaposition" (Against Interpretation 271, 269; Radical Will 167). Far from hampering Sontag in her task, the vulgariza tion that the history of the vase typifies is an absolute prerequisite for such recycling as depends on objects that cannot be considered "high</page><page sequence="12">128 Mfs art or [in] good taste"-indeed, "the more despised the material or the more barial the sentiments expressed, the better" (Against Interpretation 271). Complementing the description of the Portland Vase's descent into Wedgwood's crass commodification, therefore, is a second descrip tion that traces its later re-valuation in the British Museum after it is "decreated" at the hands of a young man in 1845 and subsequently re paired (345). "Can something shattered, then expertly repaired, be the same, the same as it was?" Sontag asks of the restoration that yields a "new vase, neither replica nor original" (347). Again, the answer that she provides applies as much to the romance narrative that she herself is recycling as it does to the piece of first-century B.C. Roman cameo glass that she describes in it: A perfect job of reconstruction, for the time. Until time wears it out. Transparent glue yellows and bulges, making seamless joints visible. The jeopardous decision to attempt a better reconstruction of the vase was made in 1989. First, it had to be restored to its shattered condition. A team of ex perts immersed the vase in a desiccating solvent to soften the old adhesive, peeled off the one hundred and eighty-nine fragments one by one, washed each in a solution of warm water and non-ionic soap, and reassembled them with a new adhesive, which hardens naturally, and resin, which can be cured with ultraviolet light in thirty seconds The result is optimal. The vase will last forever, now. (347 ) Not quite. Sontag ends the passage by qualifying the longevity of the re constructed artifact-"Well, at least another hundred years'-thereby signaling the limited shelf life that any single rendering can hope to have within an ongoing process of aesthetic fluctuation. Towards the end of reassembling her own version of the Hamil ton-Nelson affair, Sontag sets the story of romantic passion commemo rated by antecedents against a story of revolutionary passion that in most earlier accounts serves as mere backdrop. Prefigured by the fall of the Bastille, portrayed with respect to those same volcanic eruptions that previously signified amorous desire (Vesuvius's worst eruption since 1631 coinciding here with the Terror in France reaching its climax in 1794 [185]), and embodied in those Jacobin intellectuals and aristocrats</page><page sequence="13">Olster 129 who turn Naples into a Parthenopean Republic on January 29, 1799 (celebrated by Vesuvius on the evening of its proclamation [277]), the depiction of political passion in Sontag's book rescues from oblivion those omitted from earlier artistic renderings. In contrast to Emma Hamilton's superfluity of images, these are the people of whom no pop ular images remain. Such an absence does not result from lack of desire, however, for Sontag's historically marginalized revolutionaries are as interested in their imagerial renderings as those monarchists at the other end of the political spectrum. And by the time that Sontag introduces the Revolu tion of 1799 into her book, it is not just the confidante-to-the-Queen of-Naples Emma who is concerned with the way she will appear to pos terity. Nelson, who, as performing self, has envisioned his image "in history paintings, as a portrait bust, as a statue on a pedestal, or even atop a high column in a public square" from the beginning (193), resorts to cosmetic enhancement when the likenesses he has imagined start being crafted upon his return to England (330). True, the martyred rev olutionaries contemplate transformation into images at a particular time (prior to their executions) and under particular circumstances (struck by the need to embolden themselves before they die) that the monarchists never have to consider. But in seeking images of themselves that will not just remember them to future generations (much like Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in Robert Coover's The Public Burning10) but specifically set an example for future generations, they embark upon a program of in struction that is no different from that pursued by those who seek im agerial transposition for different ideological and social purposes. Nowhere is this common proclivity of romantic passions better il lustrated than in Sontag's juxtaposition of Emma Hamilton, privileged for being at center stage of the book's romantic drama, against Eleonora de Fonseca Pimentel, privileged for providing the voice that concludes her historical novel. It is not just a question of Emma's desire for amorous passion to make her "pure sensation" (263) mirroring Fonseca Pi mentel's yearning for political passion to turn her into "pure flame" (417). Even more, it is a question of the vehicles through which both women express their differing forms of passion having instruction as their primary ends. "The instruction of the people and their conversion to republican ideas-propaganda-was the only one of the revolution's tasks on which everyone could agree" (280), Sontag writes, and in the</page><page sequence="14">130 Mfs newspaper articles that Fonseca Pimentel herself writes, she proposes forms of art that can contribute to that purpose: "puppet shows with more edifying escapades for their Punchinellos," "operas with allegorical subjects such as those being staged in France" (280). Yet when Emma, draped in tunics and shawls, performs her Attitudes before invited com pany, the poses she assumes in succession are intended to provide edify ing illustrations to her guests, precisely the kind of edifying illustrations, in fact, that the romance writer seeks to evoke through recourse to an cient prototypes. Specifically, Emma is to "[illustrate the passion" of fig ures from antiquity (both male and female) because "[w]hat people made of antiquity then was a model for the present, a set of ideal ex amples," with the past providing "familiar names (the gods, the great sufferers, the heroes and heroines) representing familiar virtues (con stancy, nobility, courage, grace)" (146, 148). So successful an instruc tress does Emma become, eventually, that when she poses as successive figures from an earlier age, [s]he was not just impersonating Cleopatra now, she was Cleopatra, ensnaring Antony; a Dido whose charms detain Aeneas; an Armida who has bewitched Rinaldo-the familiar stories from ancient history and epic everyone knew, in which a man destined for glory makes a brief stop in the course of his great mission, succumbs to the charms of an ir resistible woman, and stays. And stays. And stays. (235-236) That Emma misses the whole point of the poses she incarnates re sults from the fact that the images with which she seeks to instruct are static, each governed by the selection of a single moment, "the right moment, the moment that presents meaning, that sums up the essence of a character, a story, an emotion," the combination of which leaves Emma not with a continuous narrative, but with a set of snapshots, "a living slide show of the iconic moments of ancient myth and literature" (146). And because the significant moment privileged by neoclassical aesthetics is one that "showed suffering with decorum, dignity in the midst of horror," it "evoked the worst without showing us the worst" (295). Therefore, when those revolutionaries about to mount the scaf fold seek to "show an example" through "the didactic art of the signifi cant moment," these "future citizens of the world of history painting"</page><page sequence="15">Olster 131 choose an image of themselves that represents stoicism in the face of death, based on the assumption that "[a]n image, even of the most lamentable events, should also give hope. Even the most horrifying sto ries can be told in a way that does not make us despair" (295). Unfortunately, in choosing an image that omits the full extent of the horror they undergo, they leave the future citizens of the world who view their (imagined) portraits unable to reconstruct the story that would provide the greatest amount of edification. Moreover, in assum ing that image-makers control image apprehension, they neglect the role of what Victor Bürgin has called the seeing subject and that subject's "preconstituted field of discourse" with which images interact to pro duce a story (69, 65). When all those who live by the image in Sontag's novel (which is to say everybody) thus try to reconstruct a historical narrative, they invariably get the story wrong. Nelson, whose dreams even take the form of disconnected pictures, casts the story of Emma and Hamilton as a sentimental morality play: "the fallen woman, taken under the Cavaliere's protection, who had become an irreproachable wife" (196, 195). Queen Maria Carolina of Naples tells the story of a tragic diva (Sontag's recycling of Tosca), and "the whole story came out, backward" (325). Emma relates to dinner guests the tale of a band of murderers who occupy the Cavaliere's courtyard a few weeks after her arrival, not realizing that the events she describes have occurred a quar ter of a century earlier and not even to her ( 170-172). What Emma's complete bypassing of all sense of temporal rela tions reveals, finally, is the ahistorical component of the static image, typ ified for Sontag in the photographic image that atomizes experience into "a series of unrelated, freestanding particles" and turns "history, past and present, [into] a set of anecdotes and faits divers" (On Photography 23). Psychologically useful, such a separation of actions and conse quences can "suppress, or at least reduce, moral and sensory queasi ness" (On Photography 40): the Cavaliere, who wants "nothing to disturb the beautiful images he preserved of Naples," is spared the hangings, shootings, and beheadings of revolutionaries that occur in his fair city, for Naples remains "like a picture," always "seen from the same point of view" to those who view it from aboard Nelson's ship (284, 294). As a vehicle for transmitting any edifying knowledge of history, however, the static image proves extremely limited. As Sontag again illustrates with</page><page sequence="16">132 Mfs respect to the photograph, the static image may goad conscience but never result in any "ethical or political knowledge," and, as a result, "[t]he knowledge gained through still photographs will always be some kind of sentimentalism, whether cynical or humanist. It will be a knowl edge at bargain prices" (On Photography 24). The question, then, concerns what vehicle will transmit the experi ence of the past most efficaciously-pictures or words, images or narra tives. As mediating texts, neither, of course, can presume to transmit that experience accurately. Nonetheless, in Sontag's view, the two en courage very different responses, complicity or responsibility, from their audiences: "While images invite the spectator to identify with what is seen, the presence of words makes the spectator into a critic" (Radical Will 185). The two, moreover, encourage very different temporal and spatial responses in particular. "In contrast to the amorous relation, which is based on how something looks, understanding is based on how it functions," she writes. "And functioning takes place in time, and must be explained in time. Only that which narrates can make us understand" (On Photography 23). Writing of a period in English history when only ten thousand people read newspapers and during a period of history in which increased literacy is matched by increased media imagery, Sontag has no choice but to maintain "the right velocity of narration" (328, 349), as she describes it, in order for her work to facilitate greater un derstanding. For that she must move from the image of abbreviated temporality to the narrative of conscious temporal relations. Coming Attractions Ironically, the narrative of temporal relations that Sontag com poses as a romance novel takes its cue from the insufficiency of words to describe fully what needs to be communicated, particularly when the subject at hand evokes the most extreme form of sensory response. "How can the Cavaliere communicate to an auditor how disgusting the King is," she questions, only to conclude that he cannot: "An odor. A taste. A touch. Impossible to describe" (44). How can the Cavaliere communicate how beautiful the cameos, vases, and paintings that deco rate his treasure-congested study are? "Their forms, he wrote, were simple, beautiful, and varied beyond description" (73). So frequently do</page><page sequence="17">Olster 133 such moments of inadequacy occur, in fact, that "Impossible to Describe" turns into a heading for a list ( 129). Faced with this representational insufficiency of language, the Cav aliere opts for narratives that sanitize history. "He only relates," Sontag writes of his experiences with Naples's flatulent young king, "and in the relating, the sheer odiousness of it dwindles into a tale, nothing to get wrought up over" (44). Hamilton may ease the burden of his conscience by reminding himself that the king is "just one item" that beggars de scription, but Sontag's Naples, a "kingdom of the immoderate, of excess, of overflow" (44), is a place with more than one source of odious be havior that beggars description in wonds-this, after all, is a city where people rip apart live animals tied to the base of a mountain of food built for all court celebrations. "And where everyone is shocked is a place where everyone tells stories" (38). Safe stories, like those of the Cava liere; stories designed to minimize, not dramatize, shock and spectacle. Sontag, who has long advocated an art of "shock therapy" to awaken those in the West from the "massive sensory anesthesia" that she sees plaguing them since the time of the Industrial Revolution (Against Interpretation 302), takes the opposite approach. If the narrative of linear temporal relations cannot convey the extent of her subject's shock adequately, she fractures the seamless narrative of strict chronol ogy to suggest the shock of her subject analogously, with Hamilton's Vesuvius juxtaposed against Las Vegas's fifty-four-foot-high fiberglass replica (327); Pompeii and Herculaneum against Hiroshima and Na gasaki (I 13); William Beckford's Fonthill Abbey against Ludwig ll's "Dis neyesque" Neuschwanstein (344); and gallows against gas chambers (217). With language from one period yoked to phenomena of an other, winds of southern Europe promote "a collective PMS that comes on seasonally" (86), and a naval commander who disobeys orders be comes a hero "who has in effect gone AWOL" (319). The method informing the whole is cinematic, reflecting Sontag's belief that "the distinctive cinematic unit is not the image but the princi ple of connection between the images" (Radical Will 108), and the spe cific governing principle of connection is montage. Emma's emotionally charged character raises questions about women's power in patriarchal societies, and with a "flash-forward" Sontag relates the tale of Tosca (309), the story she later has Queen Maria Carolina relate in summary</page><page sequence="18">134 Mfs form backwards (325). The Cavaliere normally observes Naples from behind windows and terraces, and with a "reverse shot" Sontag shows how he later views it while at sea aboard the Foudroyant during the 1799 Revolution (298). "You'll lose track of the time," the novel's narrator warns in Son tag's opening mise-en-scène in a Manhattan flea market, spring of 1992, prior to the jump-cut that leaves her in a London picture auction, au tumn of 1772 (3). In a very real way one does, of course, for what these fragmentations of linear time and space do-techniques comparable to the "rhetoric of disorientation" that Sontag admires in the films of jean Luc Godard (Radical Will 165)—is make past, present, and future equally present, as suggested in the oxymoronic phrase that introduces the story of Tosca as an illustration of woman's powerlessness that "a flash forward may serve to recall" (309). As a result, the narrative perspec tive of the novel grants its readers the same kind of "dual citizenship in the past and in the future" that the Neapolitan fortune teller Hamilton consults is granted by her oracular vision (58). "The future exists in the present, she said. The future, as she described it, seemed to be the pre sent gone awry" (58). The coming attractions, in short, are already here. As Efrosina also warns the Cavaliere, "[t]he future is a hole When you fall in it, you cannot be sure how far you will go" (55). And what one falls into within Sontag's comparativist history are Derridean "[mjoments of slippage, when anything seems possible and not every thing makes sense" (120), the most compelling of which concern that concept of cultural hybridity defined by Homi Bhabha and Edward Said. Naples, the wealthiest, most populous city on the Italian peninsula, and, "after Paris, the second largest city on the European continent" (20), becomes "Ireland (or Greece, or Turkey, or Poland)," another "refrac tory colony, or a country on Europe's margin," to be disciplined and dealt with accordingly (298). Palermo is shown to be to Naples what Saigon is to Hanoi, and what Rio is to Sào Paulo, and what Calcutta is to Delhi-a southern culture in which people who are "never on time" (but who do possess "a wonderful sense of rhythm") just "charm, charm, charm"-only what Palermo is to Naples is also what Naples is to Rome (225-226). Perhaps most unsettling, the 1799 Neapolitan "fairy-tale rev olution" doomed to defeat from the very beginning is also presented as the republic that seeks, in Sontag's deliberately loaded phrasing, "to win</page><page sequence="19">Olster 135 the hearts and minds of the people" in the five short (renamed) months of its existence (278, 281 ). More than anything else, these moments of slippage call into ques tion all notions of historical progress. The King of Naples decrees that animals tied to the mountain of food are to be slaughtered first and then hung in quarters on a fence. "As you see," he tells the Cavaliere, "there is progress even here, in this city" (44), a statement whose meaning its own ironic tone immediately cancels. In contrast, then, to a novel like Ragtime, which undermines complacent notions about America "then" being better than "now" in order to show historical continuities and pat terns between the early and late periods of the twentieth century, The Volcano Lover offers contiguities and parallels between circumstances that prevail in those late capitalist countries that Sontag terms modern. Viewed in this context, turn-of-the-century (eighteenth to nineteenth) Naples in Sontag's Romantic self-fashioning (to parody Stephen Green blatt) is no better or worse than turn-of-the-century (twentieth to twenty-first) America-a statement as unsatisfying to liberals who harbor hopes for the future as it is to conservatives who venerate the inheri tance of the past. Writing about the seventeen-million-dollar villa built by J. Paul Getty to house his antiquities and paintings, an architectural structure whose garish appearance seemed at odds with the Renaissance and Baroque art contained within it, Joan Didion saw a similar lesson being taught: that "the past was perhaps different from the way we like to perceive it," that "[t]he old world was once discomfitingly new, or even nouveau," finally, that "not much changes," indeed, "that we were never any better than we are and will never be any better than we were"-a lesson she considered "a profoundly unpopular political statement" (76). As Didion also noted, the Getty was modeled upon a villa buried in 79 A.D. by mud from Vesuvius, unearthed in part by digging around Herculaneum that took place during the eighteenth century (75). Writ ing about the eighteenth century directly, Sontag offers the massiveness of Vesuvius itself "instructive as well as thrilling" (6), both "[entertain ment and apocalypse" (129), whose unpredictable yet imminent erup tions signal the sense of historical irresolution to which the lesson of her book is ultimately devoted: the "permanent modern scenario" she sketched earlier in which "apocalypse looms... and it doesn't occur. And it still looms" (AIDS 175). At the time she first depicted that see</page><page sequence="20">136 Mfs nario, she, fittingly, framed it as cinematic narrative, "a long-running ser ial." Equally fitting was the name she gave to the soap opera that com prised her view of the process of history: not "Apocalypse Now," but "Apocalypse From Now On" (AIDS 176)—a variation on another old scenario admittedly, but, then again, what artifact in Sontag's aesthetic flea market isn't?
