With Plate I-J. Guernsey: Ethnography. de Guerin. Notes on the Recent Discovery of a Human Figure Sculptured on a Capstone of the Dolmen of Dehus, Guernsey. By Lt.-Col. UU T. R. M. de Gu&amp;rin. Unitil quite recently i1o seulptures liad been observed oni the stones of aun of thie dolineins of Gueriisey, and it had been suipposed that they were of an earlier date than the sculptuired dolmeiis of Brittany. In the autumii of 1918, lhowever, a carefuil examination of the dolmen of Delhus, situated at Paradis, in the parish of the Vale, Guernisey, le(l to the discovery of a sculptured human tigure of considerable initerest on the under-surface of the second capstone of the great cenitral chamb)er. The figure conlsists of a face anid two hantds witlh the outline of a portion of botlh arnms. At a little d'istance beneatlh the hanids is a crescent- shaped symbol, anid a few inelhes below the latter is a small circle touching a narrow grooved linie, wlichl extenids nearly right across the stotne, aiid possil)ly represents the girdle so often found on Frenleh statue-menhllirs. The face is represented l)y the motith, a depression 41 inlches loing by 1.1 inelhes broad, hollowed out either by grinidinig %itlh saiand andl water, or l)y scraping witlh a flint burin. The eves are two circular hioles, 1.1) iuches in diameter, place(I o01 either- side of a sinalf iiatural ridge in the stone which lhas beenl used to form the nose. On the south side of the stonie pillar, whliel supports the capstone ini the cenltre of the clhamber, are scullptured the two hanids with the tlhumbs poinitingt iinwards, an(l thte outlinie of a portion of both arms. The riiglht hland is represenited by a straight grooved linie from which spring the four fingers, four straight lilnes, with the tlhumb at ani aingle to tlhemn From the b)ase of the thlumb a narrow grooved line extenids to the edge of tlle capstonie iiear the face, marking the inuer line of the right arm, and two lines extend from the base of the little finger for a slhort distance to repre- sent the outer line of the for earm. rhbe left hand is represented with the fingers and thumb more outspread withi no straight line at their base, and two short lines form the oLltline of the hanid or forearm. At a little distance below the lhanids is the crescent-shaped design, 2 feet 10 inchles in [ 129 ] E =A '4 d FIG. 1. FIG. 2.</page><page sequence="3">No. 66.1 MAN.

The two lines nearest to the hands meet ag,ain in a point on the broken portion of the capstone. A few inches beneath this figure is a small circle five inches in diameter touching a straight grooved line. The dolmen of Dehus is the second largest in Guernsey. It stands partially concealed in its mound, within a circle of large stones, 60 feet in diameter, many of wlhich are still in situ. The great central chamber is 18 feet long by 11 feet wide by 6 feet 2 inches in height, under the western capstone, and it is entered by a gallery of access. 14 feet long, on each side of which are two small secondary chambers. It is covered by three large capstones, the western one being a large block of syrenite 14 feet 6 inches long by 7 feet 6 inches wide and 3 feet 9 inches thick. The second capstone, on whichi are the sculptured figures, is nearly in the centre of the chamber, and is of rather smaller dimensions, 14 feet 6 inches long, 6 feet wide and 2 feet 9 inches thick. It is supported by an upright stone pillar placed a little to the north of the centre of the chamber. The northern nalf of the under surface of this capstone lhas a very smooth surface, and in the opinion of Major Carey Cuirtis, R.E., President of the Guernsey Society of Natural Science, appears as if it had been rubbed down with sand and water by neolithic man, leavinog on its eastern edge a curved ridge with a rough surface a quarter of an inich above the smooth portion of the stone. When this part of the chamber was excavated by Mr. F. C. Lukis, F.S.A., in 1847, he found that a large portion of the northern end of this capstone had become detached and had fallen, at some very early period, into the cham- ber, where it was resting upon a mass of stoney rubble that had fallen with it upon the neolithic deposit of bones and vases on the floor of the chamber. It was replaced in its original position in the year 1898, by Captain F. du B. Lukis anid the Rev. G. E. Lee, F.S.A., and securely bouniid with wire ropes to the main portion of the capstone, which still rested on the stone pillar, and it was further supported by two oak posts as ani additional security. It is on this detached fragment that the face, left hand and part of the crescent- shaped design are sculptured. Anthropomorphic figures very similar to that of Dehuis are found in France sculptured on the props of the lale neolithic dolmens of the valleys of the Seine and Oise, and also of Collorgnies in the departmsent of Gard. Very similar figures are also found scuilptured on the walls of the grottoes of Le Petit Morin, Marne, wlhiclh, from the small copper beads found in them by the late Baron de Baye, are thoualgt to date from the veneolithic period.* Later representations of this same FI.3-TTEMEHI,CTL uRSY EFIG. 3.-STATUE MENHIR, CATEL, GUERNSEY. * Hubert, " Les perles (Cle cuivre et la poterie dans les grottes de la vallee du Petit Morin.

These are thought by M. J. Dechelette to be of the first Bronze Age.* In Guernsey the representation of this divinity followed the same evolution from sculpture(d slal) to statue-rmenhir as in south- eastern France, for no less than two statue-menhirs are still in existence in the island. One, a very rude statue-menhir, was discovered buried beneath the pave- ment at the entrance of the chancel of the parish churchl of St. Mary du Castel during its restoration in the year 1878 (Fig. 3). It is now in the churchyard under a tree to the N.W. of the church. It is a rude natural boulder roughly shaped into human form, only the lhead, shoulders and two female breasts being represented. Round the top of the head is a narrow raised band, and a long slightly raised necklace extends from it to the two projecting breasts. No attempt seem to have been made to iepresent the features of the face, but the surface of the stone for some distance below the band, where it naturally should have appeared, has been carefully rubbed down to a smooth surface, as if prepared for some object. At the back of the statue is a slightly raised band across the shoulders 13 inches broad. This statae-menhir must have been still ani object of worship on the introduction of Christianity into Guernsey in the sixth century, when it was evidently thrown'down and buried beneath the pavement of the sanctuary of the -New Faith, erected undoubtedly on the site of an old heathen place of worship. At the same time no doubt it was partly defaced, as the right breast has been broken off. There is no doubt that the cult of the divinity, represented by the sculptured nfgure of the dolmen of Dehus and the statue-menhir of the Castel, lasted on for loug ages in Guernsey, for the second statue-menbir, which now stands as a gate-post between the two gates of the churchyard to the south of the church of St. Martin, is of very much later date than that of the Castel (Fig. 4). It is one of the largest and best preserved statue-menhirs in existence, far surpassing in size and execution those of south-eastern France. An attempt has been made by the sculptor to model the face by making the chin project. Around the forehead and extending down the left side of the face is a row of 11 small circles of discs, and round the neck are nine raised pendants, three on the left shoulder and six in front. None are visible on the right shoulder. These may be intended to represent a torque, or, as has been suggested, the folds of a hood or cloak. At the back of the statue there is a deep groove 2 feet 11 inches in length, with an extension on the upper part of its left side, which may be intended to represent another fold of the cloak. Unfortunately, a churchwarden in the nineteenth century thought fit to fill up this groove with cement to within 21 inches of the top, but the weathered FIG. 4. * Dechelette, Manuel, Vol. I, pp. 594-603; also V"ol.

A few inches below this groove, about 17 inches above the ground, where the surface of the stone is least weathered, there are traces of a slightly raised band, 1 inches wide, whicll probably is intended to represent a girdle. There are also two short curved lines below the shoulders in the front of the statue abouit on a line with the two projecting breasts. The statue stood in the clhuirchyard, to the south of the church, until the middle of the last century, wheni it was removed to its present position. At its foot was a flat stone, which has disappeared, on which were two cup-like hollows. It was still an object of superstitious veneration at ,the beginning of the nineteenth century. It was thought lucky to make ani oblation of a few drops of wine or spirits, or to strew a few flowers secretly at the foot of i' la Gran' mere du chimquiere," as the statue was called in the old Guernsey patois. There is an important point to be noted with regard to the figure sculptured on the capstonie of the dolmen of Dehus. The inner line of the right arm can. be traced continuing right over the top of the stone pillar in the centre of the chamber, through an opening on the eastern side where the stone does not rest on the pillar. It is therefore evident from this fact that the stone was sculptured before it was placed in position, and, as the great central chamber must have been the first structure to be erected in the centre of the circle, this has an important bearing on the date of the erection of the dolmen. It, therefore, cannot have been constructed until the very end of the neolithic period, at the verge of the first Bronze Age, when, according to M. De6helette and other leading archreoIogists, the symbols of the cult of this primitive divinity first appear in France.* We have also evidence from Mr. F. C. Lukis's accountt of his excavations of the dolmen of De6hus of its long- continued use as a place of burial, and of the erection of its four secondary chambers at a later date than the great centtral chamber. He was fortunate in finding the neolithic deposit in an undistuirbed condition in the great central chamber round the stone pillar, and under the fallen fragment of the second capstone. Among the many vases he discovered here were two large caleiform vases (zoned beakers), in a nearly perfect condition, and a portion of a third. In the secondarv chamber A, to the north of the gallery, he found a large ljortion of the base of this latter vase, thrown in on the top of the soil and limpet slhells covering the skeletal remains. Fragmenits of the same vase were found strewn about in the soil of the gallery, and others were found mixed with the deposit of human bones and vases on the floor of the secondary chamber C to the soutlh of the gallery. It was therefore evident that these two clhambers had been erected after, perhaps long after, the interment represented by this calciform vase. Further proof of their later date is given by Mr. Lukis, who states that the forms of the vases he found in these secondary chambers differed from those he had found in the central chamber. They all had round bases and were without ornamentation, exactly similar to those he had found in Le Tombeau du Grand Sarrazin, a small cist a short distance from the dolmen of Dehus, while those from the central chamber had all flat bases and were of a coarser and thicker paste. He also notes that the sixth prop from the entrance on the south side, which had supported the fourth capstone, had been skilfully moved from its original position, and had been partly turned round so as to make a narrow passage to give entrance 'from the gallery into the secondary chamber C: a work, when we consider the weight of the capstone resting on the prop, that bears evidence to the engineering skill of neolithic man. * D chelette, Manuel, Vol. I, p. 583. t MS. Notes in the L ukis Museums Guern]sey. [ 132 ]</page><page sequence="6">September, 1920.] MAN. [No. 66. The two other seeondarv chambers, B and D, nearest to the entrance of the gallery seem to have been the latest constructed of all. In B were found the two kneeling skeletons, one facing east and the other west, described by Mr. F. C. Lukis in an article in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association (Vol. 1, pp. 25-29); no vases or other objects were found with them. In the other chamber, D, he noted a similar alteration in the burial customs of the people using this portion of the dolmen, while in the other parts of the dolmen at least one vase and other objects had been found with each skeletal deposit. He tells us that in chamber D he found no less than three deposits of skeletal remains, each resting upon a rude pavement of flat sea-worn stones, and covered with a thick layer of limpet shells, but with the exception of a bone dagger and a large bowl on the floor of the chamber, no other objects were discovered. The bowvl w'as found in an inverted position resting on three small angular blocks of stone, and beneath it were a few human bones. Around it were three skeletons lying on their sides in a crouched position. In the two upper layers were masses of humnan bones heaped together without order as if the bodies had beeln stripped of flesh before burial in the dolmen. These facts point to the use of the dolmen as a place of burial over a long period, a period long enough to have allowed of the introduction of a new fornm of pottery, and an alteration in burial customs. As the human figure sculptured on the capstone proves that the dolmen was erected, at earliest, very late in the neolithic period, it is therefore very probable that it was continued to be used in the first Bronze Age. This would seem to be confirmed by the discovery by Mr. Lukis of a copper knife-dagger, and two smalf copper, or bronze, rings in the dolmen. The dagger, he tells us, was found lying on the top of a mass of rubble that had been disturbed on the niorth side of the great central chamber. This fact led him to consider it a comparatively recent intrusion into a neolithic structure. However, in the light of our present knowledge of the late date of the erection of the dolinen of Dehus, and the fact that this dagger is identical in form to a copper knife-dagger found in the dolmen du rerrier du Cabut, commune d'Anglade, Gironde,* and to others also found in dolmens in the south of France, I think it is evident that it was deposited With some interment in the dolmeni early in the first Bronze Age. The question suggests itself, how did the cult of this divinity reach such an out-of-the-way locality as Guernsey at the end of the neolithic period ? There seems to be two possible routes by which it might have come; one from the Seine valley by Normandy and the other from the south by Brittaniy. The latter seems the most probable, as there is a close affinity between the neolithic culture of Guernsey and that of Brittany. We find the same forms of vases, the same pattern of their-orniamentation and also the forms of stone celts. Further, traces of trade intercourse are evident by the numerous polished stone celts and other objects, found in Guernsey of jadeite, fibriolite, serpentine and many other stones not found in the Chainnel Tslands. These show the existence of intercourse with the mainland in neolithic times. The continuiance of this intercourse in the first Bronze Age is proved by the knife-dagger and copper rings found in the dolmen of De6buis, also by a small flat copper celt, of very early form, founcd at La Hougue du Pomimier, Castel, Guernsey, and by another large copper celt (hache plate) found in Little Sark, all typical of this period. Dechelettet refers to the evidence of a trade route along the western coasts of France, from Spain to the north, in neolithic times, and particularly in the first Bronze, as the way along which the influences of the * Deehelette, Manuel, Vol. II, part 1, fig. 57, No. 4, p. 190. * Ibid.

[September, 1920O higher culture of the Mediterranean Basin reached Brittany and Western France, and from thence the southern counties of England. He also traces the cult of this primitive divinity back through Spain to an }Egean prototype. It is therefore by this route along the western coast of France, rather than from the Seine valley, that the cult of the goddess represented by the sculptured figure of the dolmeln of Dehus and the two statue-menhirs in all probability reached Guernsey. In conclusion I bave to thank my friends Dr. Fleure and Major Carey Curtis for their kind assistance in furnishing me with plans, etc. "F. W. M. DE GU1ERIN.</page></plain_text>
