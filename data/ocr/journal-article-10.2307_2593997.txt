<plain_text><page sequence="1">THORSTEIN VEBLEN. The Theory of the Leisure Class. With an Introduction by C. Wright Mills. (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin. I97I (paperback ed.). Pp. xx + 26i. 75P.) A new paperback edition of Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class (first published I 899) brings within reach of the student's pocket a classic oftener referred to than read. One can see why. Veblen, like the steam engine for Coleridge, was a giant with one idea. The exploitation of the bulk of the population of every community above the most primitive level of subsistence by a leisure class devoted to conspicuous con- sumption and deriving its means of life from the passive, unproductive manipulation of property in other human beings and/or things is made to account for every social, economic, and political phenomenon, from religion ("devout observances" towards an anthropomorphic being of still greater exploitative status) and the higher learning (the cultivation of useless knowledge as a form of conspicuous leisure) to art, fashion, sport, orthography, upper-class conservatism, and the subjection of women. It is written in an abstract, blase style without a shred of evidence other than an appeal to common- place experience. That it made such an impact in its day can be set down only to the guilt-ridden masochism of thefin de si'cle leisure class. Aside from its more questionable notions, however, such as the then fashionable ethnological explanations of contem- porary social structure (e.g. the superior predatory success of the "dolicho-blond" race-what are now called the WASPs-in the struggle for wealth and power-had he never heard of the Mafia?), there are some insights, notably the special position in the evolution of exploitation of women, as slaves, servants, drudges, and, ultimately, bearers of vicarious leisure and consumption for their male chauvinist boors. Indeed, the book is a far more effective tract in favour of women's liberation than most of the female jingoism now available. But ultimately, as the late Wright Mills shows in his perceptive introduction, Veblen misses the point: it is not the leisure and consumption of the leisure class, those epiphenomena, that matter, but the manipulation of the levers of power and wealth: "he did not really see the power elite." Nor did he have a sense of historical process, which might have suggested to him that conspicuous leisure and consumption are the marks of a decadent elite ripe for replacement by a new predatory class. That he could write on the eve of this most violent and predatory of centuries of a return, via the change from direct industrial to indirect pecuniary exploitation, to a more peaceable phase of human civilization is a measure of his value as a prophet.
