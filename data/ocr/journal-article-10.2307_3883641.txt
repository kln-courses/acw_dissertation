Most of the published papers originate in Symposia sponsored by the Society. These papers usually combine review and original research. News, obituaries, and dedicatory articles are not published. The American Society of Zoologists and the Managing Editor ofthe journal, the American Zoologist, assume no responsibility for the statements and opinions advanced by contributors. There are six issues a year. Whenever meetings of the Society are held, the issue prior to the meeting will contain the abstracts ofthe papers to be presented at the meetings. Prior to 1961, the abstracts were published as Supplements to the Anatomical Record. The Society stipulates that abstracts be research reports of high quality, that they contain new results, and that they be written appropriately as part of the permanent scientific record.

The American Zoologist publishes original, invited papers, derived prin- cipally from Symposia sponsored by the American Society of Zoologists and its affiliates. The articles are mainly of a review or synthetic nature and should not be a mere catalogue of experimental work. The paper should not be written only for a narrow circle of specialists in the field concerned; the contents should be intelligible to a majority of biologists. Specialized terms should be clearly defined, and the biological significance of the results should be specifically stated. The final manuscript (in duplicate) should be submitted to the Chairman ofthe Symposium after deiivery ofthe paper at the meeting. Failure to submit the manuscript and illustrations in a form fully ready for press at the time of the Symposium serves only to delay publication of the manuscript. All type- script (including the references) must be carefully checked for errors before submission. The submission of a manuscript will be taken to imply that the material is original and has not been and will not be submitted in equivalent form for publication elsewhere. Since Symposia typically contain a large number of invita- tional papers, and printing costs continue to spiral, a limit must be placed on the length of an individual article. Great importance is attached to conciseness of presentation. The upper limit is 10 printedpages, which includes text, references, tables, and illustrations. WRITING THE PAPER An elaborate set of instructions to authors is available on request from the Managing Editor. In general, the American Zoologist adheres to the recommendations of the CBE Style Manual published for the Council of Biology Editors by the American Institute of Biological Sciences (Fourth Edition, 1978).

Narrated in easy-to-understand language, Cryptic Fauna is an invaluable addition to General Zoology and Invertebrate Zoology classes. The film provides insights into the ecology and adaptations of interstitial organisms. Footage of many species has never before been available for classroom use. For a peek into this fascinating marine habitat, attend the preview during the Invertebrate Zoology session (Sun., Dec. 27 at 1 p.m.) at the Vancouver meeting!

AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST is the official publication of the American Society of Zoologists. It therefore has unique acceptance, authority, and credibility in the mar- ketplace. 2. The members who receive AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST are among the top profes- sionals in the zoological sciences ... key people who make the final decisions and place orders for the special instruments, books, and laboratory supplies used in these fields. 3. The readers of AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST are PAID MEMBERS and PAID SUB- SCRIBERS, proving this is a select list of readers ... the ones you want to reach. They pay for the publication so are more likely to read it, including the ads. 4. AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST is a highly respected journal, backed by a society that has just celebrated its centennial year. The journal has maintained its prominence in the field by including high quality technical research in every issue. 5. The readers of AMERICAN ZOOLOGIST need and want current information in their field to keep up to date with the latest research and techniques. They will have a sincere interest in buying from companies who show an interest in supporting their journal. O. The American Society of Zoologists is a non-profit organization. Therefore, the journal has low advertising rates. It is one ofthe least-expensive, most-effective ways you can reach the decision-makers in this field. / ? The Society needs your support. Advertising helps sponsor the publication of research in the journal. In turn, it helps to advance the expertise in our field.
