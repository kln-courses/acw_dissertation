<plain_text><page sequence="1">Narcissus and the Voyeur: James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men Robert MacLean Voyeurism is not only the source of Agee's guilt in Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, it is a major preoccupation in his oevre, ubiquitous to the extent that it assumes the proportions of a metaphysics, or more properly, of a critique of metaphysics. A voyeur is a watcher who is not himself seen, a condition which Agee derides, strains against and finally accepts. Perfect perception of those of whom he writes, on the one hand, and communi- cation to the reader, on the other, are not so much "problems" as myths, caught as if by a camera in their failure to give shape to the incomplete and irregular data of sense and memory. The understanding finds no reflection of itself in the world: it is narcissistic when it insists upon doing so, and voyeuristic when it confronts an inpenetrable, unidentifiable surface, un- aided by the faltering conventions of realism and naturalism, or of motive and intention. For Agee, attention is without a myth to guarantee the validity or continuity of its presence, an unknowable tourist in its own reality. Thus he forces the reader's attention back on itself as it moves through the text; and thus he is unable to explain his own presence to the farmers among whom he has appeared: "just say I am from Mars and let it go at that."' Scopophiliac Shudders Following the extensive preliminaries, Agee begins Book Two of Let Us Now Praise Famous Men by questioning the motives and intentions of the project as set up by Fortune magazine: I spoke of this piece of work we were doing as "curious." I had better amplify this. It seems to me curious, not to say obscene and thoroughly terrifying, that it could occur to an association of human beings drawn together through need and chance and for profit into a company, an organ of journalism, to pry intimately into the lives of an undefended and appal- 33</page><page sequence="2">34 The Journal of Narrative Technique lingly damaged group of human beings, an ignorant and helpless rural family, for the purpose of parading the nakedness, disadvantage and humiliation of these lives before another group of human beings, in the name of science, of "honest journalism" (whatever that paradox may mean), of humanity, of social fearlessness, for money, and for a repu- tation for crusading and for unbias which, when skillfully enough quali- fied, is exchangeable at any bank for money (and in politics, for votes, job patronage, abelincolnism, etc. [money]); and that these people could be capable of meditating this prospect without the slightest doubt of their qualification to do an "honest" piece of work, and with a con- science better than clear, and in the virtual certitude of almost unani- mous public approval. That Agee and Evans have "so extremely different a form of respect for the subject and responsibility towards it" (LUNPFM, 7) mitigates neither their involvement in this exposure nor their hope that their publishers will recover their investment and "a little of your money might fall to poor little us" (LUNPFM, 15). The passage sets up the self-interrogative themes of the prose, for without recourse to the excuse of respectable motives and in- tentions the book is an act of unredeemed voyeurism. Agee describes it to Father Flye, in fact, as a "piece of spiritual burglary," "a sinful book at least in all degrees of 'falling short of the mark' and I think in more corrupt ways a well."2 The status of the witness as voyeur is a major issue throughout Agee's work. The early story, "Death in the Desert" (1930), offers the image, mediated by a car window, of a marooned and desperate Negro gesturing wildly for help on a desert highway-"For some shameful reason the effect was grotesquely funny, if indeed there was any effect"3 - who is abandoned; the narrator, by definition a teller of stories, and a liar even to those with whom he collaborates by his silence, finishes by struggling to arrange his thoughts into a credible order, a story by which that collusion might be extenuated. The narrator of "They That Sow in Sorrow Shall Reap" (1931) regards himself as "a horrible failure" at carrying any "one idea through," getting "at the bottom of anything": at writing a coherent story. His fellow lodgers, like him "myopic" in their limited points of view, are unaware of his taking note of their mundane attitudes: "when, caught in these flimsy inescapable cogs, they are contemplated in their unrealized relation to the timeless severence of the vast radiance of life, and the enormous shadow of death, they become magnificent, and tragic, and beautiful" (CSP, 96-98). "1928 Story" (1968) describes the tentative recollection of a phase of his youth by a middle-aged writer, who feels that his reconstruction if "Very likely... completely subjective"; this self-examination unfolds like a telescope, for this early phase is itself given over to intense self- contemplation; fascinated, at that time, by the image of a girl he has seen only once, he seeks her family's cottage at dusk and watches through the window:</page><page sequence="3">Narcissus and the Voyeur 35 Taking care to stay out of the light, he came closer. She read in a way that fascinated and satisfied him, detachedly, yet in complete absorption. Each time she turned a page, it was like watching someone take another mouthful of food, with perfect elegance. Then, with the same elegance, she put her finger tip into one nostril, and worked, patiently, without interrupting her reading, until she had extracted the annoyance. Still reading she rolled it between the tips of her forefinger and thumb, until it was dry, smelled of it, and flicked it to the jute carpet. God, Irvine thought: she's wonderful! He felt ashamed of himself; for now he waited, hoping that she would do this or something like it again; and when he became sufficiently aware of his shame, he withdrew, to past the rear of the cottage. There on the line, he could see bathing suits. He struck a match so that he might enjoy the cedar color. Suddenly we [sic] wanted to smell the suit. What sort of a Peeping Tom am I, he said to himself, touched it - it was a fine silk-wool - and walked away.4 "A Mother's Tale" (1952) describes a cow's relation to an audience of calves of the apocryphal story ("It was my great-grandmother who told me.... She was told by her great-grandmother, who claimed she saw it with her own eyes, though of course I can't vouch for that") of the one who came back from the stockyards bearing "the mark of the Hammer...like the socket for a third eye," having been hung up and flayed before actually dead, inviting his bearers "to examine his wounded heels...as closely as they pleased" (CSP, 255-56, 250), and telling of the fate that awaits all cattle: Ishmael, escaped alone to tell us; Christ as reporter. Just as the prose in LUNPFM is Agee's investigation of his own memory images and states of emotional poise, The Morning Watch (1951) and A Death in the Family (1957) are progressive extensions into and researches of his more remote subjective past, much as is suggested by Irvine's meditation in "1928 Story": Father Flye remarks of A Death in the Family that, with a few modifications, the circumstances of Agee's father's death and the portraits of the characters involved "are just taken literally from fact; that is, they're practically photographic."5 In 1937 Agee proposed to the Guggenheim foundation the writing of an autobiographical novel of which "Only relatively small portions would be fiction (though the techniques of fiction might be used); and these would be subjected to nonfictional analysis" ("Plans for Work," CSP, 165); and he later wrote, "I find that I value my childhood and my father as they were, as well and as exactly as I can remember and represent them, far beyond any transmutation of these matters...into poetry or fiction ("Four Fragments," CSP, 142). The title, The Morning Watch, connects the idea of self-investigation with looking, and portrays a child's effort to fix his attention during the ritual vigil of Good Friday morning ("Could ye not watch with me one hour?" "Pay attention, he told himself. Mind your own business") as the vision of "his mind's eye,"6 before which images appear against his volition:</page><page sequence="4">36 The Journal of Narrative Technique of Christ, in a maudlin portrait of affected passion (MW, 31); of Christ's wounds profanely compared, via the line, "he saw more wounds than one" in Venus and Adonis, with a "rawly intimate glimpse" of a female playmate (56); and of his father's corpse (49), the same image which is the final medi- tation of A Death in the Family. Whereas Agee's act of devotion, his watching or concentration of attention, is to his minutely remembered past, Richard's memories are an impious interruption of his vigil. Richard himself is watched by God ("remember Thou God seest me" -27), by Father Whitman ("Don't think I won't be watching for you"-25), by the forest ("each separate blossom enlarging like an eye"-27), by the locust shell ("the eyes looked into his"-130), by the snake ("the eye seemed to meet Richard's"-144), by his companions as they undress to swim, by Agee, and by the reader. His own coming to manhood is a movement away from his naive sense of piety and anxiety for precedent, and a defiance of watchful authority by an awakening attention that strains against the "silly rules" of the school (40). Agee's idea of God requires that "either he delivers autonomy to all his creation and creatures and in compassion and ultimate confidence watches and awaits the results, or he is second-rate God, a sort of celestial back-seat driver" (LFF, 180). In A Death in the Family, Rufus struggles with the idea that "God wants us to make up our own minds": "Even to do bad things right under his nose?"7 To watch and wait is to endure the ambiguous without the guarantee of precedent, as Richard does when he overstays his watch and goes truant from school, an act which affords him his unprecedented vision of a bril- liantly coloured snake: "for a few seconds he saw perfected before him, royally dangerous and to be adored and to be feared, all that is alien in nature and in beauty: and stood becharmed" (MW, 141). Whereas Richard's attention ought to be an agent of discipline ("you just watch your mouth"- 44), it is sacreligious in its uncontrolled wandering, furtively deployed in a giddy, unsteady freedom: with his companions, "their six eyes emphatic in the sleepless light," he admires senior students at work, whose eyes are "fixed in the profound attentiveness of great scientists" (36-37), and particularly relishes "this surprising chance to be so near [the athlete Willard] and to watch him so closely," especially the hump between his shoulders, which Richard "had never yet had the chance to examine so privately" (41, 42). Later he eavesdrops as these seniors discuss him, be- coming suddenly "frightened because he was spying" (101). His attention is limited by, but not to be identified with, the position of his eyes, which can disguise his inspections: "along the side of his eye Jimmy advanced" (51); "he opened his eyes...and without turning his head glanced narrowly around him through his lashes" (78). When he surveys the apparently empty mannerisms of Claude, he feels it "as shameful to be watching him this way, so unaware that he was being watched, or that he might look in the least silly, so defenseless, as it would be to peer at him through a keyhole" (81). Meditating Christ's sufferings at the hands of the soldiers, Richard "can see</page><page sequence="5">Narcissus and the Voyeur 37 him only as if he spied down on what was happening through a cellar window," a point of view comparable to that of Peter the Betrayor, "hiding on the outskirts, spying through the window. He was afraid to show himself and he couldn't stand to go away" (113-14). Just as Peter strikes an ear from the servant of the serpentine Judas (22), Richard strikes the head of a potentially venomous snake; a contrite voyeur, he too confronts his terrify- ing solitude, intensified both for Richard and for the narrator by the lack of unambiguous connection between the subjective image and 'reality' ("he began to wonder whether these tricks of visualization were not mere tricks and temptations of emptiness"- 105), by the sense of having "failed" in the meditative quest for knowledge, both of God ("make me to know thy suf- fering"-23) and of self, the nature of attention. "My cup runneth over, something whispered within him, yet what he saw in his mind's eye was a dry chalice, an empty Grail" (119). "Dream Sequence," unpublished until 1968 and apparently written as an introduction to A Death in The Family, is set in Knoxville, Tennessee, Agee's home town. A frightened dreamer awakens in doubt "that the meaning of any dream could ever be known," but "sure that that was where the dream indicated he should go. He should go back into those years. As far as he could remember. and everything he could remember...nothing except.., .what he had seen with his own eyes and supposed with his own mind." As for trying to "understand" the experience, he will "make the journey, as he had dreamed the dream, for its own sake, without trying to interpret." Suddenly he is aware of his father's presence in the room, a witness "who also knew the dream, and no more knew or hoped ever to know its meaning than the son," a ghost similar to one of Hitchcock's, whose function, like that of the camera, is to look on. Comforted by the presence of his father-"God keep you. Or whatever it is that keeps you"8 -the dreamer takes up the third-person narration of the events sur- rounding the death of Rufus Follet's father, including such scenes as are built around words and noises heard by Rufus in the night through sleep, and so forgotten "that years later, when he remembered them, he could never be sure that he was not making them up" (DF, 29). The empirical problem of distinguishing dream from reality is identified as a problem of reconstruction, as is illustrated by the long family argument over whether or not it has been visited by Jay Follet's ghost (76-85). The existence of ghosts is problematic for Rufus, who cannot sleep for fear of a darkness which is alternately gentle, "hollowed, all one taking ear," "all one guardian eye," and protective of menacing and abysmal "creature... which watched him" (82, 84). Like Richard, Rufus feels spied upon, ashamed of his inappropriate behaviour before the ghost of his father: "But if his father's soul was around, always, watching over them, then he knew. And that was worst of anything because there was no way to hide from a soul, and no way to talk to it, either. He just knows, and it couldn't say anything to him either, but it could sit and look at him and be ashamed of him"</page><page sequence="6">38 The Journal of Narrative Technique (264-65). Rufus himself is an indefinable attention, struggling with the meanings of words and of his father's death: the narrator of "Knoxville: Summer, 1915," speaks of "the time when I lived there so successfully dis- guised to myself as a child," and of the sound of the blood "which you realize you are hearing only when you catch yourself listening" (11, 13); there is a painfully hilarious scene of panic when Rufus and his sister are almost caught eavesdropping on their Mother's conversation with the minis- ter (281); and in that view of his father's body which climaxes the book - given in a series of descriptions beginning "He could see..." He watched..." "He watched..." "He gazed..."- the body is "actual" as is nothing else in the room, and Rufus is able, in his hushed wonder, to see him "much more clearly than he had ever seen him before" (290-91). W. M. Frohock has pointed out that Agee brings to A Death in the Family the techniques of script-writing, moving his narrative vision over the details he describes like the view-finder of a camera9; we are notified of this method, in fact, in the description in chapter one of Rufus and his father sitting twice through a William S. Hart movie, the sequence of scenes con- nected only by a recurrent "and then," and the dynamized rectangle viewed as if by a detached analyst, so that "the great country rode away behind [Hart] as wide as the world": the appearance of Charlie Chaplin, hooking a woman's skirt up with his cane and "looking very eagerly at her legs" (19-20), suggests the nature of that watching. Agee's screen-plays consis- tently portray the camera as interloper and spy, entering and exploring a Victorian house so that the "whole quality of emotion should be that of a microscopic slide drawn into razor focus and from now on totally at the mercy of the lens," and pausing to look "at itself close and hard in the mirror" ("The House," CSP, 184, 187). The camera in "Man's Fate" is regarded by a Chinese soldier "sternly, and with a kind of cold tragic scorn, as if into the leaning and questioning eyes of a likewise doomed comrade who does not fully understand the situation" (CSP, 233); in "Noa Noa," which makes repeated use of Gaugin's painting, "The Spirit of the Dead Watches," it advances with other onlookers to gaze at Gaugin's corpse, reads his mail over his shoulder, is caught intruding on his privacy- "Then for a moment he seems to catch sight of us, staring at us" - and receives the resentful glances of a half-dressed model. '0 In his "Introduction" to a series of photographs taken by Walker Evans with a concealed camera on the New York subway, Agee speaks of them as privileged moments comparable to that which ends City Lights, at which the subject's guard is down: "The simplest or the strongest of these beings has been so designed upon by his experience that he has a wound and nakedness to conceal, and guards and disguises by which he conceals it""; the series is rhythmically punctuated, in fact, by the startled glares of those who catch the camera at work. As a film critic, Agee praises a war-time report composed of captured film for presenting "an image of a world, a phase, which we shall never see by any other means, since it will be wholly altered by the mere presence of our</page><page sequence="7">Narcissus and the Voyeur 39 fighters, cameramen, and observers, once they get there," and recommends it "to anyone who would like to be walking in Europe, invisibly, today."12 And scenes in Rossellini's Open City are "as shatteringly uninvented- looking as if they had been shot by invisible newsreel cameras" (AF 1, 195). Some scenes in the war-record film Attack! are of such power as to have "made me doubt my right to be aware of the beauty at all," and Agee recom- mends, for the "communicating" rather than just the "recording" of war, "a still more intrusive use of the camera in places where cameras are most unwelcome.., .since the reaction of those who resent the prying would react in turn upon the consciousness and conscience of the audience" (99-100). He likes The Raider, played by sailors re-enacting actual experiences, for its realization that "you have no right to record the sufferings and honor the fortitude of men exposed in a life-boat unless you make those sufferings at least real enough in swollen features and livid coloring, feebleness of motion and obvious crushing headache, to hurt an audience and hurt it badly" (224); and he qualifies his praise for two editions, by Paramount and by Fox, of film recording the Battle of Iwo Jima: Very uneasily, I am beginning to believe that, for all that may be said in favor of our seeing those terrible records of war, we have no business seeing this sort of experience except through our presence and partici- pation. I have neither space nor mind yet, to try to explain why I believe this is so but...I cannot avoid mentioning my perplexity.... If at an incurable distance from participation, hopelessly incapable of reactions adequate to the event, we watch men killing each other, we may be quite as profoundly degrading ourselves and, in the process, betraying and separating ourselves the farther from those we are trying to identify ourselves with; none the less because we tell ourselves sincerely that we sit in comfort and watch carnage in order to nurture our patriotism, our conscience, our understanding, and our sympathies. (152) Motive and declared intention do not mitigate the vicarious nature of the voyeuristic experience. Let Us Now Praise Famous Men This is the central anxiety addressed in LUNPFAM. Agee is a "northern investigator" in depression Alabama, "a spy, travelling as a journalist"; and Evans is "a counter-spy, travelling as a photographer" (LUNPFM, 377, xxii). Agee regards "aspects of a young couple which are less easily seen... when one's own eyes and face and the eyes and fact of another are mutually visible and appraising"; Agee and Evans are, "in spite of our knowledge of our own meanings, ashamed and insecure in our wish to break into" and examine a church; and Agee agonizes over his unworthiness of Emma Wood's declaration, "we don't have to act any different from what it comes natural to act, (and we don't have to act any different from what it comes</page><page sequence="8">40 The Journal of Narrative Technique natural to act) and we don't have to worry what you're thinking about us, it's just like you was our own peopel" (40, 64). In all such situations he plays his "part through," rehearses and re-rehearses "my demeanors and my words," is "unable to communicate to them at all what my feelings were" (31, 32, 37); yet he takes every opportunity to observe- "While we talked I was looking around slowly"-and finds "even the lightest betrayal of our full reactions unwise" (431, 470). It is "most important of all," he says, to realize that those of whom he writes are actual human beings, "living in their world, innocent of such twistings as these which are taking place over their heads.., .who were dwelt among, investigated, spied upon, revered, and loved, by still others, still more alien; and...are now being looked into by still others, who have picked up their living as casually as if it were a book" (13). The prose in LUNPFM is a verbal transcript, "simply an effort to use words in such a way that they will tell as much as I want to and can make them tell of a thing which happened and which, of course, you have no other way of knowing," and as such is comparable to the war-record film he later reviews for its implication of the reader in his voyeurism: '"Who are you who will read these words and study these photographs, and by what right do you qualify to... ?" (246, 9). The presence of the reader's attention, emphasized by Agee's use of the first person plural as he explores the deserted Gudger house (137, 171), is of questionable motive, "actuated toward this reading by various possible reflexes of sympathy, curiosity, idleness, et cetera, and almost certainly in a lack of consciousness, and conscience, remotely appro- priate to the enormity of what [he is] doing" (13). Involved in his perception of the beauty of the tenant's world, "best discernible to those who by economic advantages of training have only a shameful and a thief's right to it," is the interrogation of the '"sense of beauty,"' of his own perspective: "but by what chance have I this 'opinion' or 'perception' or, I might say, 'knowledge'?" (203, 314). Agee is fiercely defensive against his own and his reader's prying, and celebrative of that about the tenants which cannot be described, their own conditions as crippled and deprived witnesses or subjective "centres." His "effort," he says, "is to recognize the stature of a portion of unimagined existence, and to contrive techniques proper to its recording, communication, analysis and defense. More essentially, this is an independent inquiry into certain normal predicaments of human divinity" (xiv). He defines this divinity, and his own attention, empirically-that is, by negation-dealing only with recorded data and the record itself-the mode of that data's availability. He self-reflexively addresses the medium of this exposure, the word and the photographic and mnemonic image: his subject is himself, who "must mediate, must attempt to record, your warm weird human lives" (99): "The immediate instruments are two: the motionless camera and the printed word. The governing instrument - which is also one of the centers of the subject-is individual, anti-authoritative human consciousness" (xiv).</page><page sequence="9">Narcissus and the Voyeur 41 Like The Morning Watch, LUNPFM abounds in images of eyes and watching: a sky which "held herself away from us and watched us" (21); Negro workers "watching carefully to catch the landowner's eyes, should they be glanced after" (27); a child's "repeated witness" of his parents' inter- course, which "he lifts his head and hears and sees and fears and is torn open by" (109); the knee-high details of "the earliest and profoundest ab- sorptions of a very young child" (p. 149); the freshness of light in a shut- tered room "as if the objects were blinking or had been surprised in secret acts" (157-58); the floors, roof, walls and furniture of a room as "all watch upon one hollow center" (220); the "wild blind eyes of the cotton staring in twilight" as the work day ends, and surveying "like the eyes of an overseer" the daily picking (344, 327); Ricketts compulsively talking and laughing "while, out of the back of his eyes, he watched me" (p. 388); and the tenant women undressing, "turning part away from each other and careful not to look" (71). Most disturbing are "the eyes of the streets" of the Alabama town (9), "(eyes, eyes on us, of men, from beneath hat brims)" (67), of people who "slowed as they passed and lingered their eyes upon us," and of people on farmhouse porches, visible in the rearview as the car passes (25, 32). Agee deals with the eyes of by-standers in "They That Sow in Sorrow Shall Reap" and in two fragments describing mobs who witness gory deaths and respond with "the craziest, gayest sort of laughter" (CSP, 137-40); and the Knoxville townspeople of "Dream Sequence" exhibit an impassive "interest... strangely out of ratio to the thing they were looking at."'3 But the "following, the swerving, of the slow blue dangerous and secret small- town eyes" in Alabama (373), with which he must cope at his first meeting with the tenant farmers, is that of the potential southern mob salient in the American imagination from Huckleberry Finn to Easy Rider, "mean white faces that turned slowly after me watching me and wishing to God I would do something that would give them the excuse" (362, 377). An equally dangerous and impersonal kind of watching is that of the camera, "an ice-cold, some ways limited, some ways more capable eye" (234), the danger of which is the "so nearly universal a corruption of sight" resulting from its misuse" (11). Appended to LUNPFM is a New York Post interview with Margaret Bourke-White about her collaboration with Erskine Caldwell on You Have Seen Their Faces (1937), another photo- prose coverage on impoverished farmers: her statement that "One photograph might lie, but a group fo pictures can't" (453), is at odds with Agee's, in his introduction to Helen Levitt's "A Way of Seeing," that "'The camera never lies' is a foolish statement.... The camera is just a machine, which records with impressive and as a rule very cruel faithfulness precisely what is in the eye, mind, spirit, and skill of its operators to make it record."'4 In this sense, as an instrument of subjectivity sharply limited in its relation to any exterior 'reality,' the camera, "handled cleanly and literally in its own terms.., .is, like the phonograph record and like scientific instruments and unlike any other leverage of art, incapable of recording</page><page sequence="10">42 The Journal of Narrative Technique anything but absolute, dry truth" (LUNPFM, 234). And Agee regards as central to his "sense of the importance and dignity of actuality and the attempt to reproduce and analyze the actual... a sense of 'reality' and of 'values' held by more and more people, and the beginnings of somewhat new forms of, call it art if you must, of which the still and moving cameras are the strongest instruments and symbols" (245). Thus, much of the description in LUMPFM is in terms proper to the camera: the quality of withdrawal in the dead of night is compared to "the lifted foot arrested in stopshot" before completing its step (52); details of the countryside emerge at dawn "like a print in a tank" (87); light in a darkwalled room is "restricted, fragile and chemical like that of a flash bulb" (198); leaves twitter in heavy rain "as under the scathe of machinegun fire, or alternate frames cut from a stretch of film" (394); the erosive action of a river is conceived as if "by sped up use of the moving camera" (251); the geometry of furniture legs and the grains and scars of a bare wood floor are such as "a moving camera might know" (149); and the various gestures of work are seen as "the grave mutations of a dance whose business is the genius of a moving camera, and which it is not my hope ever to record" (324). The image of Mrs. Gudger and her family as they diminish in the distance and disappear over the horizon is set up as a lingering shot in a filmic memory, and dissolves into the present tense - "They are gone" - with Agee alone in their undefended house: "upon this house the whole of heaven is drawn into one lens; and this house itself, in each of its objects, it, too, is one lens." Agee's clandestine exploration of the dwelling, his "being made witness to matters no human being may see" (135-36), his thorough itemization and description of its contents and their arrangements, his "knowledge of those hidden places.., .those griefs, beauties, those garments whom I took out, held to my lips, took odor of, and folded and restored so orderly" (188), his activity as a "cold-laboring spy" (134), is paralleled by the "cold absorption" of the camera, "a witchcraft.., .colder than keenest ice," used secretly and repeatedly under the guise of "testing around" or "using the angle finder": "(you never caught on; I notice how much slower white people are to catch on than negroes, who understand the meaning of a camera, a weapon, a stealer of images and souls, a gun, an evil eye.)" (362-65). Among the objects Agee examines is a photograph of Annie Mae's mother, the face faded "as if in her death and by some secret touching the image itself of the fine head...had softly withered, which even while they stood there had begun its blossoming inheritance in the young daughter at her side" (164): what the camera records, as Cocteau was later to remark, is death at work. Just as, in "They That Sow," the eight roomers are "endowed with as many different machines for attacking existence, and defending themselves against it" (CSP, 97), subjectivity is described in LUNPFM as mechanism, the carried child's head swiveling "mildly upon the world's globe, a peri- scope" (135): while the senses can be assisted "by dream, by reason, and by</page><page sequence="11">Narcissus and the Voyeur 43 those strictures of diamond glass and light whereby we punch steep holes in the bowels of the gliding heavens.., .and step measurements upon the grand estate of being," the tenant child is deprived of "instruments" whereby even to recognize complex moral issues, for "the lenses of these are smashed in his infancy, the adjustment screws are blocked" (105, 108). In "1938 Story" memory is connected with the replaying of a phonograph record; in LUMPFM it is connected with all recording devices, but chiefly with the camera: "the child, the photographic plate receiving: These are women, I am a woman... this is how women are, and how they talk" (72). Such comparisons emphasize the passivity of the witness before his experience, the impossibility of abstracting himself from it, and of any exhaustive, self- consistent mode of representing it. The "taking" of the senses is titanic beyond exhaustion of count or valuation, and is all but infinitely populous beyond the knowledge of each moment or a lifetime: and that which we receive yet to not recognize, nor hold in the moment's focus, is nevertheless and continuously and strengthfully planted upon our brains, upon our blood: it holds: it holds: each cuts its little mark: each blown leaf of a woodland a quarter-mile distant while I am absorbed in some close exactitude: each of these registers, cuts his mark: not one of these is negligible. (106-07) Agee refers to this vast and cumulative transcript as the "record in the body" (10): like Gauguin, whose corpse is found "savagely paint-marked" (AF 11, 145), Agee's body is a text, a record or piece of exposed film. And he insists upon a maximum exposure: to hear Beethoven's Seventh or Schubert's C-Major Symphony, you must turn the sound up and "get down on the floor and jam your ear as close to the loudspeaker as you can get it and stay there, breathing as lightly as possible.... As near as you will ever get you are inside the music; not only inside it, you are it; your body is no longer your shape and substance, it is the shape and substance of the music" (15-16). He becomes "entirely focused" (49) on an object he describes, defines himself as a focus unabstractable from what is observed. A detailed present-tense description of Ivy Woods' clothing, as she waits under the stares of some town men to see a doctor, finishes with the ob- servation that "her dark sweated nipples are stuck to the material and show through, and it is at her nipples, mainly, that the men keep looking" (285); "Two Images" also comprises detailed present-tense descriptions, one of Squinchy Gudger being breast-fed, centered upon his partly erect penis, the other of Ellen Woods asleep under a flour sack, a celebration of her vulva (441-42): each description holds in focus and explores an image, and each excludes mention of the watcher, who stares at Mrs. Woods as surely as do the Cookstown men. Agee's contempt for himself as a voyeur and his reverence for his victims involve him in a self-negation which aligns with the implications of his epistemology:</page><page sequence="12">44 The Journal of Narrative Technique If I were not here; and I am alien: a bodyless eye; this would never have existence in human perception. It has none. I do not make myself welcome here. My whole flesh; my whole being; is withdrawn upon nothingness. ... What is taking place here, and it happens daily in this silence, is intimately transacted between this home and eternal space; and consciousness has no residence in nor pertinence to it save only that, privileged by stealth to behold, we fear this legend: withdraw; bow down; nor dare the pride to seek to decipher it.... The wasp who cruises the roof, on the other hand, "is not unwelcome here: he is a builder; a tenant. He does not notice; he is no reader of signs" (187-88). More positively, watching is a metaphor for attention, alert and joyfully participating in the actual, "the whole realm of what our bodies lay in and our minds in silence wandered, walked in, swam in, watched upon," the body "inseparable from the mind, identical with it": "at such time we have knowledge that we are witnessing, taking part in, being, a phenomenon ana- logous to that shrewd complex of the equations of infinite chance which became, on this early earth, out of lifelessness, life." To watch, to be con- scious and know it, is literally wonderful, but wonder is perhaps, like beauty, merely a linguistic "sense," part of a provincial and transient vo- cabularly: the difference between a conjunction of time, place and unconscious consciousness and a conjunction of time, place and conscious consciousness is, so far as we are concerned, the difference between joy and truth and the lack of joy and truth. Unless wonder is nothing in itself, but only a moon which glows only in the mercy of a sense of wonder, and unless the sense of wonder is peculiar to consciousness and is moreover an emotion which, as it matures, consciousness will learn the juvenility of, and discard, or only gratefully refresh itself under the power of as under the power of sleep and the healing vitality of dreams, and all this seems a little more likely than not, the materials which people any intersection of time and place are at all times marvelous, regardless of consciousness. (pp. 225-27) The question, as always, is whether we may project past the data of ex- perience. The sceptically, reflexively treated concerns of self and text merge in the act of writing. To write is to sort, and while words could "be made to do or tell anything within human conceit," they cannot "communicate si- multaneity with any immediacy" (236-37): Agee lists the ingredients of an odour "more subtle than it can seem in analysis" (154). The wealth of detail which "so intensely surrounds and takes meaning from" any one subjective "center... should be tested, calculated, analyzed, conjectured upon, as if all in one sentence and spread suspension and flight or fugue of music," a perfect vehicle of simultaneity which Agee finds himself incapable of sus-</page><page sequence="13">Narcissus and the Voyeur 45 taining, for "one can write only one word at a time" (111). Excerpts from Louise Gudger's school books, quotations of Shakespeare and Marx, adver- tising slogans, a tenant sign reading "PLEAS! be Quiet!" (197) and inscrip- tions in the Gudger bible are presented as vehicles, manipulative and symp- tomatic, of verbal meaning. A scissored piece of newsprint lining a drawer is quoted in full, including its fragments of words, sentences and photo- graphs, and is held against the light so that "the contents of both sides of the paper are visible at once" (169): the attention is to the status of words and images as sensory signs, the fragments of arbitrary symbols or conventions of meaning. 'Sense' becomes self-interrogative. The formulation, ( (?) ) ) How were we caught? (81), diagrams the presence of a puzzled, inquiring attention, bounded by marks of signification which it can neither transcend nor identify with, the colon suggesting an impending elaboration, qualification or contradiction. Under- standing is limited by its form, and, in the absence of ultimate context, involves obviation rather than insight. As he sits writing by lamplight, Agee is a "center" in the midst of a frightening darkness, at the edge, as it were, of his thinking: so that I muse what not quiet creatures and what not quiet forms are suspended like bats above and behind my bent head; and how far down in their clustered weight they are stealing while my eyes are on this writing; and how skillfully swiftly they suck themselves back upward into the dark when I turn my head: and above all, why they should be so coy, with one slather of cold membranes drooping, could slap out light and have me: and who own me since all time's beginning. Yet this mere fact of thinking holds them at distance, as crucifixes demons, so lightly and well that I am almost persuaded of being merely fanciful; in which exercise I would be theirs most profoundly beyond rescue, not knowing, and not fearing, I am theirs. As he expands his meditation to the infinite and impersonal darkness far beyond the ceiling, in which "no one so much as laughs at us," he questions, "do we really exist at all?" (52-53). The text itself, the on-going arrangement of words which encodes his questioning, is the only evidence. The failed intentions recorded in that text-"tenderly intended" but de- structive parental love (105), a piece of middle-class furniture which "has picked up tenant-kitchen redolences for which it was never intended" (179), houses which look even "'poorer'. . than.. . by original design" (270), the failed "intention" of teachers and school texts (294, 299), plans of action gone awry (374)-complement its failed intentions to describe: "But there must be an end to this...a new and more succinct beginning" (99); "But somehow I have lost hold of the reality of all this" (414). With its various</page><page sequence="14">46 The Journal of Narrative Technique plans and descriptions of overall design, LUNPFM is a compilation of Agee's unrealized intentions, listed as casually as if by a conceptual artist: "This volume is designed in two intentions: as the beginning of a larger piece of work, and to stand of itself"; "Ultimately, it is intended that this record and analysis be exhaustive," but "Of this ultimate intention the present volume is merely portent and fragment, experiment, dissonant prologue" (xv); "The text was written with reading aloud in mind. That cannot be recommended"; "It was intended also that the text be read continually, as music is listened to or film is watched" (xv); "If I could do it, I'd do no writing at all here. It would be photographs... fragments of cloth, bits of cotton, lumps of earth, records of speech, pieces of wood and iron, phials of odors, plates of food and of excrement" ([13); Let me say... how I wish this account might be constructed. I might suggest, its structure should be globular: or should be eighteen or twenty intersected spheres, the interlockings of bubbles on the face of a stream; one of these globes is each of you. (101) Like Gudger's overalls, LUNPFM is a blueprint. Finally, to allow description to sag into naturalism, which is "at the opposite pole from your intentions, from what you have seen, from the fact itself," is to fail; but Agee can only say of the remedies he discusses that "Failure... is almost as strongly an obligation as an inevitability, in such work: and therein sits the deadliest trap of the exhausted conscience" (236, 238). While he exalts and credits his "best intention" he must acknowledge that "Performance, in which the whole fate and terror rests, is another matter" (16). In his concern for the "cleansing and rectification of language" (237), Agee gives constant attention to the clarification of terms: "The tenants' idiom has been used ad nauseam by the more unspeakable of the northern journalists but it happens to be accurate: that picking goes on each day from can to can't" (340). While he does not, like the naturalist, abjure metaphor, he comments on and undercuts it, reducing it, for example, to the terms of physiology in his discussion of cotton farming: I can conceive of little else which could be so inevitably destructive of the appetite for living, of the spirit, of the being, or by whatever name the centers of individuals are to be called: and this very literally: for just as there are deep chemical or electrical changes in all the body under anger, or love, or fear, so there must certainly be at the center of these meanings and their directed emotions; perhaps most essentially, an in- calculably somber and heavy weighted and clark knotted iron of sub- nausea at the peak of the diaphragm, darkening and weakening the whole body and being, the literal feeling by which the words a broken heart are no longer poetic, but are merely the most accurate possible description. (327) This inability to name or define the centers of individuals is the issue: "What</page><page sequence="15">Narcissus and the Voyeur 47 is it, profound behind the outward windows of each one of you, beneath touch even of your own suspecting, drawing tightly back at bay against the backward wall and blackness of its prison cave, so that the eyes alone shine of their own angry glory, but the eyes of a trapped wild animal, or of a furious angel nailed to the ground by his wings, or however else one may faintly designate the human 'soul"' (99). Unable to establish its origin and identity, subjectivity is orphaned: in A Death in The Family, Rufus naively exults in his status as an orphan, though the darkness has taunted him as he lies awake (like the writer of LUNPFM, fighting off horrid imaginings,) "You hear the man you call your father: how can you ever fear?" (DF, 294, 84); and Agee finishes "Dream Sequence" by acknowledging that his life "had been shaped by his father and by his father's absence."" Neither does evolution provide a mode of identity: in "The House," Agee details a shot of swastikaed uniformed midgets, their feet "grinding faces of Negroes, Jews," and carrying the effigy of a crucified woman under the legend, "MOTHER," her head "a schoolboy globe of the earth" (CSP, 173); so that the evolution myth is portrayed as a form of Nazism. Agee's scepticism about myths of origin is clearest in his rejection of anthropomorphic description: We bask in our lavish little sun as children in the protective sphere of their parents: and perhaps can never outgrow, or can never dare afford to outgrow, our delusions of his strength and wisdom and of our intel- ligence, competence and safety; and we carry over from him, like a green glow in the eyeballs, these daytime delusions, so inescapably that we can not only never detach ourselves from the earth, even in the per- ception of our minds, but cannot even face the fact of nature without either stone blindness or sentimentality.... We have known, or have been told that we know, for some centuries now that the sun does not 'set' or 'rise': the earth twists its surface into and out of the light of the sun. In its twisting the earth also cradles back and forth, somewhat like a bobbin, and leans through a very slightly eccentric course, and it is this retirement out of and a return into a certain proximity to the sun which causes the change of seasons.... Just how much poetry, or art, or plain human consciousness, has taken this into account. You have only to look at all the autumn art about death and at all the spring art about life to get an idea.... No doubt we are sensible in giving names to places: Canada; the Argentine. But we would also be sensible to remember that the land we have given these names to, and all but the relatively very small human population, wear these names lightly. (LUNPFM, 247-49) He nevertheless frequently describes anthropomorphically, projects what he calls "local fact" (248) onto unknowable objects and landscapes, so that a</page><page sequence="16">48 The Journal of Narrative Technique silent glade "seems to be conscious and to await the repetition of a signal" (130), and a hill under rain is trenched and seamed "as if" it were an exposed human brain (139). However, the anthropomorphism is pointedly self- interrogative in such comparisons as of the earth to a sleeping human head, "yielded over to the profound influences and memories...of its early childhood, before man became a part of its experience" (247). It is used, as the phrase "as if" is often used, to isolate and clarify an image by vivid comparison, so that a roof beyond the "bones of rafters" is "a stomach sucked against the spine of fear" (52). Conditional similes introduced by "as if" are tentative but sharply drawn comparisons, which tersely'wrench an impression away from any necessary connection with its source into a jarring, unrelated but illustrative context - "Miss-Molly, chopping wood as if in each blow of the axe she held captured in focus the vengeance of all time" (324), a deranged old man restrained "as if he were a dog mastur- bating on a caller" (35): the precision of such renderings has to do, not with the object, but with its appearance, so that the symmetry of a wooden church is as strong "as if it were an earnest description better than the intended object" (38). Descriptions are the forms and limits of understanding: "The peace of God surpasses all understanding; Mrs. Ricketts and her youngest child do, too" (289). Although he prescribes exercises and gives extended descriptions of labour in the second person (339), like Godard, who has Jane Fonda and Yves Montand do actual work in a sausage factory in Tout Va Bien, the implication of Agee's scepticism is that no matter how much is known of a tenant woman's life, "you cannot for one moment exchange places with her" (321). That scepticism assumes, at times, Berkeleyan proportions, as in re- current allusions to the sounds of night, which "have perhaps at no time ceased, but that will never surely be known...one hears them once again with a quiet sort of surprise, that only slowly becomes the realization, or near certainty, that they have been there all the while" (84). In his medita- tion on chance and necessity, Agee entertains "the more than reasonable suspicion that there is at all times further music...beyond the simple equip- ment of our senses and their powers of reflection and deduction to appre- hend" (231). And while he contemplates an event's "ramified kinship and probably hidden identification with everything else," he can himself offer only "a series of careful but tentative, rudely experimental, and fragmentary renderings of some of the salient aspects of a real experience" (245-46), cannot do "better than blankly suggest, or lay down, a few possible laws" (105). Like the tenant child, "this center, soul, nerve," Agee is the center of a subjective "bubble and sutureless globe" (104), unable to penetrate the screen of his own experience. The Romantic Episode: Narcissism as Nostalgia It is the sense of strain involved in the constant acknowledgement of the</page><page sequence="17">Narcissus and the Voyeur 49 indefinability of the watcher that gives into the only story-shaped, con- clusion-directed episode in the book-a section which suggests nothing so much as Moby-Dick, the report of, among other things, a compulsive quest. "Part Three," entitled "Inductions" and prefaced by the Introit of the Mass-which is also quoted to preface the discussion, "SHELTER" (123), involving approaches to the "altar" of a table with precisely arranged ob- jects and its "Tabernacle," a drawer and its contents - narrates the progres- sion from a first meeting with the three farmers in Cookstown to Agee's penetration of a center, "Six sides of me all pine" (420), a room in the Gudger house in which he reads and examines the family bible. The section, "First," concerns their being taken to the Ricketts house to photograph the three families and the anticlimax - "which, you must understand, is just not quite nice... .this is just one of several reasons why I don't care for art" (366)- wherein Agee falls in love with Louise Gudger and conceives the aim of establishing "ultimate trust" and "love" between the tenants and the reporters (370). "Second" moves through "Gradual," arranging with Woods to stay among the families, "Reversion," a shift back to the events leading up to Agee's first night with the Gudgers, and "Introit," his entrance of the Gudger house during an afternoon storm. Having retired to Birmingham for refreshment, Agee and Evans experience themselves as tourists, con- suming in detail the sights of the city, and as voyeurs, watching an opposite window as "a woman is shifting from nightgown through nakedness to day clothing but the sun is spread strongly enough on that tall windowed wall that we can scarcely see anything" (374). Agee takes the car, leaves without Evans and without specific destination, laying "down into the driving as if into a hot bath," passively "watching the road disinvolve itself from the con- cealing country and run under me" (375); it is as if the windshield were the dynamized rectangle of a movie screen, and with similar implications of peeping: "Through windows could be seen details of rooms...and at the same time the window surfaces gave back pieces of street and patterns of leaves on light" (379). Agee, that is, is behind glass - an impermeable surface which mediates all experience. When he compares his secret exploration of the Gudger house to his pubescent masturbation, he recalls having "planted my obscenities in the cold hearts of every mirror in foreknowledge"; but as a voyeur rather than a narcissist, Ishmael rather than Ahab, his attention is to the naked body of the house, which is itself "one lens," and computes surface rather than depth, the corrupted mirror "rashed with gray, iridescent in parts, and in all its reflections a deeply sad zinc-to-platinum" (136 -7, 161). Agee else- where uses the image of glass to illustrate the same point, speaking in "Permit me Voyage" (1934) of air that is "passionless as glass"14; and the destruction in "The House" is paralleled by the smashing of a fish-bowl which leaves a gold-fish gasping on the carpet (CSP, 192). The breaking of glass in some form or the removal of spectacles (as when Degas examines Gaugin's painting in "Noa Noa"-AF 11, 97), so as to suggest penetration</page><page sequence="18">50 The Journal of Narrative, Technique and contact, are stock devices in the vocabulary of the cinema, and fre- quently accompany eye-contact, as well as sexual or otherwise violent oc- currences: when Agee slows his car-the speed of which "had walled me away as though with the glass of a bathosphere from the reality of this heat; but now the glass was broken and... I was a part once more of the pace and nature of this country" (LUNPFM, 378)- he indicates the shape of this epi- sode, its movement from seeing through a glass, darkly, to an attempt to see face to face. Like Ahab, Agee is crippled, cut off from any sense of identity, and bent on some form of resolution: his sense of sexual urgency crystalizes as a fantasy, as he sits "unable to move.., .looking out through the windshield," of an ideal girl with whom perfect communication might briefly be estab- lished, for which he ridicules himself as a "fantast" (382-84). Since, despite the importance of breaking down the identification of word and thing, human beings are incapable of not dreaming, Agee has come in search of identity, of meaning; his period in the city has brought him "terrible frus- tration, which had in its turn drawn me along these roads and to this place scarce knowing why I came, to the heart's blood and business of my need" (389). The voyeur has again become a narcissist: like Ahab, Agee raises his personal need for an identity-"who am I, who in Jesus' name am I" (284)-to the status of a necessity. And it is satisfied, he says, "twice over... two 'dreams,' 'come true,"' which are compared in their fulfilling power, to an adolescent fantasy of love, this perfect sharing involving en- thusiasm for a marching song of rescue, "though our images were different," hers of World War I prisoners, his, via daguerro-types and Brady photographs, of a Civil War prison-camp and deserted loved ones. The comparison is not inappropriate, Agee says, since those of whom he writes are likewise "imprisoned" and waiting, though he doubts whether rescue will come in the form of Russian Communism. He also compares his ful- fillment to refreshment at a forest spring, "so cold, so clear, so living, it breaks on the mouth like glass," and to drinking at a "human" springhouse, staring into the "broad affronted eyes" of a bullfrog (389-93). The first dream come true comprises Agee's visit to the Gudgers, with- drawn into their darkened house in terror of a storm, a powerful experience of eye contact with Louise Gudger, and a movement out after the rain, which has ended a long drought and seems to Gudger "sure enough to have been an answer to a prayer," into the communal work effort of mending damaged trees and sorting fruit, which brings Agee close to tears: "and there was a movement and noise all round me where at length I found my- self' (406-07). The "Second Introit" involves his return, after his car has become stuck in the mud, to stand "silently... vertical to the front center of the house" (411)-Ahab confronting his whale- until the Gudgers are awakened by their dog and take him in: as the Tennessee-born Agee sits talking and eating the meal Mrs. Gudger has prepared, the feeling increased itself upon me that at the end of a wandering and</page><page sequence="19">Narcissus and the Voyeur 51 seeking, so long it had begun before I was born, I had apprehended and now sat at rest in my own home, between two who were my brother and sister, yet less that than something else; these, the wife my age exactly, the husband four years older, seemed not other than my own parents, in whose patience I was so different, so diverged, so strange as I was; and all that surrounded me, that silently strove in through my senses and stretched me full, was familiar and dear to me as nothing else on earth, and as if well known in a deep past and long years lost, so that I could wish that all my chance life was in truth the betrayal, the curable delu- sion, that it seemed, and that this was my right home, right earth, right blood, to which I would never have true right. For half my blood is just this; and half my right of speech; and by bland chance alone is my life so softened and sophisticated in the years of my defenselessness, and I am robbed of a royalty I can not only never claim, but never properly much desire or regret. And so in this quiet introit, and in all the time we have stayed in this house, and in all we have sought, and in each detail of it, there is so keen, sad, and precious a nostalgia as I can scarcely otherwise know; a knowledge of brief truancy into the sources of my life, whereto I have no rightful access, having paid no price beyond love and sorrow. (415) Without transition he turns to an impersonal, unflattering listing and description of the foods and their tastes, and his efforts to keep it down and appear pleased by it, undercutting by anticlimax the most powerful passage of communion in the book. As in Moby-Dick, and throughout Agee's work, the struggle is between dreamer and cold critic. Agee is given a room, examines the record of marriage, births and death inscribed in the family bible, with its "strong cold stench of human excrement" (424), and struggles to sleep in a vermin-ridden bed; the next morning the car is reclaimed and he drives Gudger to work, again experiencing the world through a windshield. The northern reporter on the tenant situation and harbinger of help, who advises Emma Woods and apostraphizes the Ricketts children, "(Jesus, what could I ever do for you that would be enough)" (386), sits talking with Gudger in the car "about what the tenant farmer could do to help himself out of the hole he is in," until Gudger gets out to go to work: "I told him I sure was obliged to him for taking me in last night and he said he was glad to have holp me" (431-32). The communal experience is such that Gudger assumes his own role, is helper rather than helped; despite shared food and louse-bites, and the most strenuous observation and description, he is unique, alien, ultimately unknowable: the White Whale disappears uncaptured, taking Ahab with him and leaving Ishmael afloat on the surface- ambiguous, unexplained, somewhat embarrassed.
