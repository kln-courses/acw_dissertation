<plain_text><page sequence="1">Influenza Epidemics SIR,-Dr. Pickles has raised an interesting point. There have been epidemics of influenza, such as those of 1688 and 1693, which were recorded to have first appeared in these islands, but it is certainly true that in none of the nineteenth and twentieth century pandemics were we the first victims. Again, there is little doubt that two of the other pandemic diseases, plague and cholera, have always reached Europe by extension from Asia or Africa. But that is not so easy to prove for influenza. In his discussion of the 1918--19 pain demic, the late Dr. Bruce Low (Report oni the Pandemic of Influenza, S.O., 1920, pp. 202 et seq.) pointed out the diffi culty, amounting to impossibility, of following the spread iromii any one focus or group of related foci, although he seemed to approve an American view that the extension was f'r'om11 east to west and so to bring the pandemic into line with th.at of 1889-90. Clearly we should like to believe this for the reasons Dr. Pickles gives, and adoption of his practical sug aestion may do good. It is, however, well to consider an alternative hypothesis namely, that epidemic influenza is not generated throuLgh a chain of infective persons linked up witlh some remote focai point but arises independently when the necessary local bio logical conditions are fulfilled. If that were so, we might expect to find that influenza does usually beconme epidemic in some remote area, simply because a general change (whether cosmic in Hamer's sense or simply demographic) would find suitable conditions earliest there. From the point of view of droplet infections the conditions of life in East Europe a nd Asia have been worse than those of West Europe for some e centuries. Hirsch (vol.- i, p. 36) remarked that influenza i has llot spread more quickly in oLur own times, with their multiplied and perfected ways and means of commLlnication, than in former decades or centLuries," and also roundly asserted (op. cit., p-. 35) that " there is not the slightest cogent, reason fcr supposing that the several parts of an influenza pan(lemic stand in a genetic relation to one another, or that it is a ques tion of the conveyance of a disease-producing substance from place to place." We know that Hirsch was wrong in his inference-namely that influenza was not an infectious disease in the biological sense-but the facts from which he drew false conclusions are still facts. They can be reconciled with newer knowledge if we suppose that local foci of infection are, under certain con ditions, readily formed and that spread does not take place by means of long infective chains extending over- hundreds or thousands of miles but by many very short ones. The obVious weakness of the argument is the proviso "under certain con ditions." What conditions'? Of course, we must be on our guard against anthropomorphic reasoning. The miseries of that species so quaintly named HoI3io sapiens overshadow our sky but may be a very small item in the unknown total wrhich adds up to pandemic influenza. But the state of our urban populations is uinique, statistically speaking. There have indeed, to ouir shame, always been sonme thousands of people living under conditions not so mtich worse than those of' ouIr worst air-raid shelters; but these poor orphans of civilization,</page><page sequence="2">846 DEC. 14, 1940 CORRESPONDENCE TIIHE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL as Simon called them, were semi-isolated groups. Now they are not. There have never been such opportunities for Nature to do experiments in herd epidemiology, and natural experiments are sometimes on a very large scale.-I am, etc., Loughton, Dec. 8. MAJOR GREENWOOD. SIR,-I have read with great interest Prof. Major Green wood's article (November 16, p. 677), and Dr. R. E. Hope Simpson's subsequent letter (November 30, p. 765). The suggestion submitted by Dr. Hope Simpson that we must look for something more than direct contact infection to explain the flame-like rapidity with which influenza spreads when it assumes pandemic form is supported by a study of the character of the principal epidemics of the disease in the past, and of the views expressed by epidemiologists. In Priinciples anid Practice of Preventive Medicinie, edited by the late Dr. C. W. Hutt and the writer, the possible explanation of the velocity of the spread in pandemic influenza is dis cussed, and reference is made to the possibility suggested by Dr. Hope Simpson. Parsons, who made an exhaustive study of the pandemic of 1899-92, concluded that the disease was propagated chiefly by human contact, although he qualified this by stating that the contagion might propagate itself outside the human body. Crookshank has expressed the view that there is a relation ship. between influenza epidemics and cosmic influences, and Richter has stated that influenza pandemics depended on certain anticyclonic weather conditions for their development. Madsen, who has carefully investigated the seasonal incidence of disease in Denmark over a long period of years, inclines to the view that the seasonal fluctuation of disease is due to some seasonal alteration in the individual. The continuity of influenza virus infection was postulated by the late Sir William Hamer. He considered that th-e infec tion was sustained by " precursors " and " trailers " represented by infections of the central nervous system before and after the main epidemic of influenza. Indeed, all the evidence at present available, and not least the flame-like rapidity -of infection, tend to support the view that the virus of influenza is a constant habitant of the human host, which, owing to conditions not clearly known, assumes virulent and infective properties and gives rise at intervals to widespread outbreaks of the disease. The difficulty which has to be faced in elucidating the problem of the aetiology of influenza is the fact that the disease as met with in epidemic form is a mixed infection due to the specific virus and secondary organisms. In this con nexion an interesting observation has been made by Green wood, Topley, and Wilson. They have found that in herd . infection the degree of immunity conferred by a previous attack is more marked and more durable in the case of a virus infection than in certain bacterial infections.-I am, etc., Helensburgh, Dec. 3.
