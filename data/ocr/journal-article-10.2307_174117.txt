CONCEPTS A recent report on developments in cognitive psychology describes the current idea of concepts. It is no longer news that many people in cognitive science have adopted a new view of concepts. In psychology, the new view is best known as "prototype theory.". . . The heart of the theory is that (1) a concept is mentally represented, in part by a "prototype," i.e., by properties that are true of some concept instances but not all; and (2) an object will be characterized as an instance of a concept to the extent that it is similar to the concept's prototype. A number of possible functions or rules may then help determine the similarity of concepts and objects to which they may refer. For example, an instance and a concept can both be represented in terms of discrete features ... similarity is an increasing function of the features common to the prototype and the AUTHOR'S NOTE: This research was done in, and supported by, the Program on Political and Economic Change in the Institute for Behavioral Science, and the Program on Peace and War in the Center for International Relations, both at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

Such concepts play an important role in scientific discourse as paradigms, models, and metaphors. PARADIGMS Different concepts may be combined in paradigms that imply the proper form for scientific method. Thus, in the logical empirical tradition, the scientist begins with a few simple axioms. From them, he or she deduces a set of propositions or hypotheses to test against observed empirical facts. Various alternative concepts organize competing scientific paradigms or traditions. MODELS Within these different scientific paradigms, verbal, logical, or mathematical models define subordinate concepts. These abstractly defined expected processes are then extended to observed real world phenomena. METAPHORS Scientifically derived concepts may also be used as metaphors (see Olson, 1971). In this case, the scientific method validates ideas in other areas. In an earlier time this was known as the argument from authority, which might come from revealed religious truth, secular historical tradition, or the writings of learned men. Today celebrated scientific leaders may achieve a wide reputation by applying scientific methods in a particular limited substantive field. Their achievements may provide them with a heroic stature, encouraging others to accept their judgments. They are then able to attain a more generalized impact, perhaps using other methods and moving outside their area of expertise. A good example of this is the relationship between Noam Chomsky's work in linguistics and politics. PARADIGM AND MODEL Robert Axelrod's book The Evolution of Cooperation uses concepts in all three of these scientifically related ways. Axelrod clearly relies on the logical empirical paradigm of science. "The project began," Axelrod tells us, "with a simple question: When should a person</page><page sequence="3">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 173 cooperate, and when should a person be selfish in an ongoing interaction with another person ?" (p. vii). This question, of course, led to others, including the evolutionary dilemma of "how cooperation can emerge among egoists without central authority" (p. viii). First, how can a potentially cooperative strategy get an initial foothold in an environment which is predominantly noncooperative? Second, what type of strategy can thrive in a variegated environment composed of other individuals using a wide diversity of more or less sophisticated strategies? Third, under what conditions can such a strategy, once fully established among a group of people, resist invasion by a less cooperative strategy?" Axelrod approaches the problem from both theoretical and empirical directions. He believes that "a simple way to represent" the potentially cooperative situation is through the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game (p. vii). Axelrod begins with a typically noncooperative situation, the standard two person game of PD. He transforms it from a static to a dynamic mode, by changing the "one-move Prisoner's Dilemma in which defection is the dominant choice, to an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma in which conditional strategies are possible" (p. 77). In other words, the game now includes multiple rounds of play. Starting from such roots, Axelrod sets forth a few primitive terms from which he logically derives a general theory of cooperation "to characterize all collectively stable strategies for Prisoner's Dilemma" (p. 57). Axelrod tested this theory through a series of tournaments, or contests. Axelrod focuses, as I shall, on the program that won two actual tournaments and five of six hypothetical tournaments. This program appears as a robust prototype for "how to play the game well" (p. 29). It was submitted by Anatol Rapoport and named tit-for-tat (TFT). Rapoport, of course, had a considerable advantage. He is one of the major figures in game theory, including theoretical development, laboratory testing, as well as creative and careful real world application (see Rapoport and Chammah, 1965). TFT was the simplest program submitted. On the first move, the program cooperated. Following that, it simply copied the other player's response on the previous move. If the other player had cooperated, TFT continued to cooperate. If the other player had defected, TFT also defected. TFT had the highest aggregate score competing against all other programs. It did not, however, have the highest dyadic score competing against other individual programs. Paradoxically, Axelrod observes, "TFT never once scored better in a game than the other player!" He concludes that, "in fact, it can't." It lets the other player defect first, and it never defects more times than the other player has defected. Therefore, TFT achieves either the same score as the other player, or a little less. TFT won the tournament, not by beating the other player, but by eliciting behavior from the other player which allowed both to do well. TFT</page><page sequence="4">174 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION was so consistent at eliciting mutually rewarding outcomes that it attained a higher overall score than any other strategy [p. 112]. Axelrod's work is an important step in developing dynamic social scientific paradigms and models. His research contributes, first, to a growing tradition of evolutionary and reflexive epistemology. Axelrod makes it clear that the work of theoretical deduction is not necessarily anterior to empirical testing. Rather, both emerge over time in a series of related steps. The various aspects of the general abstract theory are discussed as the text develops, and also in a more integrated way in the appendix at the end of the book. Further, both Axelrod's theoretical conceptions and the models of the contestants are refined in varying degrees from the first to the second round of the tournament.' The book is imaginative and innovative in extending the formal theory of games and testing it through computerized experimentation. It is particularly useful in advancing dynamic specification and understanding of PD. Many limiting assumptions are relaxed. Payoffs do not need to be comparable, symmetric, or measurable on an absolute scale. TFT does not require central authority or control, messages, commitments, friendship, trust, or altruism (pp. 17-18, 69, 174). As with any work, there are aspects that could be improved. Axelrod includes only a few summary tables and figures concerning the tournament and its competing computer programs. Some detailed and extended discussions had appeared earlier. It would also have been useful in the book to have included more systematic comparative analyses as well as some of the actual computer program code. Some of the strategies other than TFT are only discussed in passing; more extensive treatment would have been better. Thus, one of Axelrod's theoretical propositions states that, for a nice strategy to be collectively stable, it must be provoked by the first defection of the other player" (p. 21 1). Otherwise it can be exploited, for example, if the opponent alternates cooperation and defection. Yet Axelrod tells us that tit-for-two-tats, which responds only to defection "on the previous two moves," would have done even better than TFT in the initial contest. Such performance would have depended on a very specific environment of other strategies. Some other fascinating variants are mentioned only briefly in passing-for example, an artificial intelligence, chess type program, Look Ahead, which won the preliminary tournament (p. 39). There are some possible inconsistencies. Axelrod includes in his theory a variable discount factor (w), which weights each move so that it is worth less than the move before. A conscious formulation of a winning strategy would thus depend on a correct appreciation of the future oriented discount factor w. Yet Axelrod also says that "cooperation can evolve without ... foresight" (p. 69). 1. Axelrod's work was reported, as it developed, in a number of places, including two articles in the Journal of Conflict Resolution (Axelrod, 1980a, 1980b). The Evolution of Cooperation contains a bibliography.</page><page sequence="5">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 175 This can technically be true, but only if one also assumes that the actors adopt their strategies without foresight. Early in the book Axelrod informs us of the "very useful fact" that the sum of an "infinite series for any w greater than 0 and less than 1 is simply I / I -w" (p. 13). In the appendix of theoretical proofs, he refers to this when he says that, "in the iterated game, the cumulative payoff to either of the two players who always cooperate with each other is R + wR + w2R ... = R/ 1 - w"(p. 207). In very short games in which w was close to 1, there might be substantial discrepancies between the value predicted by the formula and the actual payoff to the players. Axelrod interprets his results to suggest that TFT, once established, has a strong tendency towards evolutionary stability and expansion, if w is large enough. Such ultrastability may not be true in all environments. For example, once established, TFT implies cooperative interactions. If there were no other competing strategies in the environment at this point, a strategy that included only cooperative actions could invade. It would be behaviorally indistin- guishable from TFT and equally successful.2 At one point he indicates that a positive valuation of cooperation is not strictly necessary; but elsewhere he suggests it important that mutual cooperation be "valued," and that the actors "care about each other's welfare" (pp. 17, 85, 135). Additional comment would have extended the book, and perhaps lessened its popular appeal, but it would also have presented a more comprehensive technical picture. METAPHOR A major aspect of the book's power and appeal comes from its application outside the laboratory. In this guise, the work appears not just as research, but as a crucial experiment in advancing our understanding of cooperative activity in various aspects of life. This dimension will be our primary concern here. Axelrod is at pains to extend his results through powerful metaphors linking games and strategies to the nonexperimental world. One of the more popular sets of metaphors in literature and social science centers around games as general prototypes for other forms of interdependent human behavior. Games ordinarily include activities that we pursue in our leisure time, relatively frivolous amusements perhaps, card games like poker or bridge, board games like chess or checkers, sports. These games are commonly compared with other aspects of life. We may, for example, think of football as war, with different components or teams as analogs to air force or infantry. Writers from different 2. To use the language of evolutionary biology, actors with two different strategies might have the same phenotypes, but different genotypes. See Maynard Smith (1982).</page><page sequence="6">176 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION cultures have taken a broader view of games, developing ludic models that seek to illuminate deeper aspects of human existence.3 Social scientists have been particularly interested in comparing aspects of social reality with formally structured mathematical games. Axelrod, as we have seen, focuses on one of these games, PD, for theoretical and empirical analysis. He also makes it a metaphor for other aspects of life. A "basic problem occurs," he says, "when the pursuit of self-interest by each leads to a poor outcome for all." He goes on: To make headway in understanding the vast array of specific situations which have this property, a way is needed to represent what is common to these situations without becoming bogged down in the details unique to each. Fortunately, there is such a representation available: the famous Prisoner's Dilemma game [p. 7]. Axelrod presents us not only with a prototypic game, but also with ideal type decision makers. He describes the winning strategy, TFT, in anthropomorphic terms. TFT has an identity with human qualities. It is not necessarily rational; it is, however, nice, perceptive, and clear. It also has a short memory, and is provocable, forgiving, and patient. Game theory in the social sciences generally assumes a rational decision maker. This has been particularly appealing because it is consistent with the assumption of human rationality associated with western liberal culture. Interestingly and importantly, Axelrod's decision maker does not necessarily come from this mold. Thus, Axelrod says: There is no need to assume that the players are rational. They need not be trying to maximize their rewards. Their strategies may simply reflect standard operating procedures, rules of thumb, instincts, habits, or imitations. He continues, even more daringly: The actions that the players take are not necessarily even conscious choices. A person who sometimes returns a favor, and sometimes does not, may not think about what strategy is being used. There is no need to assume deliberate choice at all [p. 18]. 3. For example, Caillois (1961) extracted four types of games from the myths of the Greek Gods Agon, Alea, Meimes, and Ilinx. Agonistic games were games whose model was that of the classical Greek athletic contests. They were basically competitive games-but with limits. The purpose of the game was to demonstrate one's superiority over rivals, but they stopped short of serious physical damage. Aleatory games were essentially games of chance, in which fate or destiny played an important part. In such games, nature replaced man as the primary adversary of the players. Mimetic games included mimicry or role playing, either on the stage or in the identification of spectators with the actual players of various games. Finally, ilinctic games involved vertigo, or loss of balance, children playing around a maypole, or certain games in amusement parks or carnivals. There are aspects of all of these games in our contemporary lives. See also Hesse (1970); Huizinga (1962).</page><page sequence="7">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 177 TFT is "nice." It starts in a friendly way. It cooperates first. It is "never ... the first to defect" (p. 67). Moreover, it continues to cooperate if the other player cooperates. TFT is, however, also perceptive. It is "maximally discriminating," in the sense of being able to recognize "the recent behavior of the other player" (pp. 66, 174). At the same time, it encourages accurate perception by its opponent. TFT is "clear" and "easy to recognize" (pp. 53-54). Being extremely simple, it is easy for the opponent to interpret. And it reacts fast, giving immediate feedback in one move. TFT has a memory, though it is short. Much of the work previously done in game theory assumed no memory. There was only one round of play that either represented a single move or summarized the game's entire set of moves. In the iterated PD, however, TFT can "recall" what happened in the past, even though the past only extends to the previous move (p. 174). Partly because of its recognition and memory capabilities, TFT is not generally a sucker. By cooperating on the first move against less nice programs, TFT is, of course, suckered when the other program initially defects. If this happens, however, TFT recognizes the fact and responds by defecting on its next move. TFT is thus reciprocal, "nonexploitable," "provocable," and "retali- atory." Axelrod explains that "a rule can be called retaliatory if it immediately defects after an 'uncalled for' defection from the other" (pp. 44, 53-54, 69). One defection by its opponent is enough. After that, it gives back what it has received. TFT is, however, "forgiving" (p. 54). Axelrod explains as follows: Forgiveness of a rule can be informally described as its propensity to cooperate after the other player has defected . . . TFT is unforgiving for one move, but thereafter is totally forgiving of that defection. After one punishment, it lets bygones be bygones' [p. 36]. Thus TFT does not hold a grudge, even if the other player defected earlier, on one or a number of occasions. It is "patient" (54) and willing to wait; as soon as the other player resumes cooperation, TFT was willing to do the same. APPLICATIONS Axelrod suggests that his results can be applied in a number of important issue areas. These include various sectors of international relations, domestic politics, labor relations, biology, theology. In terms of our earlier discussion of concepts, these are the areas of commonality between the model and political reality. There are four logically possible sets of two move sequences: DD, CC, CD, DC. The first of these, DD, represents a kind of state of nature. It is the natural outcome of the noniterated Prisoner's Dilemma.</page><page sequence="8">178 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION In the first place, "all D is collectively stable." DD may thus result when w, the discount parameter, is low. Axelrod notes that any strategy, like TFT, "which may be the first to cooperate can be collectively stable only when w is sufficiently large" (pp. 210-211) and future rounds of play cast a long shadow. Otherwise incentives for defection are increased. Axelrod illustrates these dynamics through a number of concrete examples: the defection of Pompey's allies as his prospects fell; difficulties of members of Congress in doing legislative business if they face likely electoral defeat; the sale of business accounts receivable at a discount with the prospect of imminent bankruptcy; shoddy treatment of temporary visiting professors by their more permanent colleagues; parasitic destruction of a sick or aging host in a terminating symbiotic biological relationship (pp. 59-60, 103). Further, TFT's discrimination and provocability require that another actor's subsequent defection produce immediate retaliation, or DD. Axelrod illustrates this sequence from Old Testament religion, which required an "eye for an eye" (pp. 39, 137). Domestic governments, charged with upholding the collective laws, punish noncompliance (p. 180). International deterrence and the arms race are obvious examples. And in war, there can be "a powerful ethic of re- venge" (85). CC, on the other hand, is the language of mutual reward. One of the virtues of Axelrod's work is that CC is implied everywhere. Religious believers will recognize CC. The Old Testament describes the cooperative covenant between God and his people. The New Testament enjoins us to love our neighbors as ourselves; the Golden Rule (p. 136) to do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Political philosophers will recall the social contract theorists or Kant's categorical imperative. Axelrod refers scientists working in the field of biological evolution to "genetical kinship theory and reciprocity theory" (p. 89). Coalitions form around the kernel of CC. TFT implies the evolution of cooperation both within and between groups. Individual actors use CC to establish their own cooperative networks. Further, Axelrod's research implies that TFT may be a good strategy between groups as well. If CC develops, smaller groups can merge with larger ones. These coalitions occur in many different contexts. Thus Axelrod gives us an extended and interesting discussion of the way in which "non-aggression between the troops emerged spontaneously in many places along the front" as part of the "live-and-let-live system in trench warfare in World War I" (pp. 74, 77). He suggests that, in a related way, "arms control could also evolve tacitly" (p. 181). Similarly "cooperation based on reciprocity" created a "clustering" that "gradually replaced an original pattern of mutual 'treachery' in the U.S. Congress" (p. 68). The dynamic of cooperation is also reflected in "collusion" between economic competitors in market situations, or between players and umpires in baseball (pp. 178, 180). Unfortunately, life is not always so even. Sometimes one actor cooperates, but others-from chance, stupidity, stubbornness, desires to cheat, to get</page><page sequence="9">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 179 something for nothing, to bully, or for other possible reasons-do not reciprocate, but defect instead. These games, depending on one's perspective, have the colorful names of "Temptation" or "Sucker." Axelrod's analysis suggests that these asymetrical configurations are less likely to provide optimal results and be stable. Thus, during the trench warfare of World War I, higher orders might lead to some attacks by one side or the other, which would be echoed back and forth for some time. After a while, however, the attacks would diminish, and tacit cooperation would reappear. Axelrod notes that "there was an inherent damping process that usually prevented these retaliations from leading to an uncontrolled echo of mutual recriminations" (p. 80). The PD/ TFT metaphor extends beyond describing and explaining cooper- ative aspects of life. Axelrod is at pains to drive home the predictive and normative implications of his work. A main lesson is that TFT wins. It does not overcome its competitors in pairwise matches, but it does produce better overall results. It wins in actual competition against all the other strategies, and it wins in extended computer runs that simulate "survival of the fittest" (p. 50). Such laboratory victories imply real world victories as well. In the later portions of the book, Axelrod builds on this success story by providing "advice to participants and reformers" including suggestions on "how to choose effectively" (part four). These include: 1. Don't be envious. 2. Don't be the first to defect. 3. Reciprocate both cooperation and defection. 4. Don't be too clever. He also indicates "how to promote cooperation": 1. Enlarge the shadow of the future. 2. Change the payoffs. 3. Teach people to care about each other. 4. Teach reciprocity. 5. Improve recognition abilities. LIMITATIONS Axelrod writes seductively. His general metaphor is compelling because of the many specific examples. Further, his argument resonates in many different corners of our experience. Prisoner's Dilemma is a well known game that outlines important questions of cooperation, conflict, and choice with deep philosophical, historical, and social scientific roots. Tit-for-tat satisfies our innate desires for reciprocated esteem, material reward, and power or-failing these-revenge. The CC model for coalition formation triggers a whole social</page><page sequence="10">180 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION scientific index, including segmentary relations within and between tribal societies, Kropotkin's mutual aid, Riker's side payments, Olson's observations on state development and decline, Charles Osgood's GRIT strategy for international arms reduction. DD, on the other hand, may remind us of duels and feuds, or the dynamics of international escalation described in Schelling's "slippery slope." Nevertheless, we may still ask ourselves about the extent to which this experiment contains an adequate metaphor for cooperative activity. Going back to our discussion of concepts, we must consider areas of distinctness between the model and political reality. Axelrod refers to these as "complicating" or "potentially relevant factors." He believes that the value of an analysis without them is that it can help to clarify some of the subtle features of the interaction-features which might otherwise be lost in the maze of complexities of the highly particular circumstances in which choice must actually be made. It is the very complexity of reality which makes the analysis of an abstract interaction so helpful as an aid to understanding. At the same time he carefully warns that "no intelligent person should make an important choice without trying to take such complicating factors into account" (p. 19; see Shubik, 1984: 302). To begin with, there are obvious limits to the fit between the structure of any game and other environments. Axelrod's game is well defined and tidy, a parsimonious, orderly model of social reality with clear definitions of rules, players, strategies, and outcomes. Unfortunately, other parts of the world tend to be more confusing. Life does not usually present itself as a serially ordered set of 2 X 2 tables.4 Axelrod's game does not depend on a lot of superordinate rules, but there are some, and they are important. In other aspects of life, such rules may be difficult to discern, or may not exist at all. For example, international conventions, treaties, agreements, practices are elements of a large body of international law, which supposedly distinguishes between behavior that is in conformity with accepted norms and that which is not. Nevertheless, this law shows varying degrees of clarity and contradiction in different substantive areas. Further, it does not prevent violation by players who do not choose to observe it. Indeed, the violation of some aspects-for example, external intervention in the domestic affairs of other sovereign states-is an important part of international relations. In this sense the formal rules of international law are not rules at all, or are only a small part of the real rules. Axelrod provides for regular simultaneous taking of turns. Actors in other areas of life do not always get equal turns. Sometimes, as in the case of the democratic electorate, they may get only a few turns compared with many for the elite. Or, as with Marx's proletariat, they may have no turns-at least no 4. Some such social scientific efforts, however, have made an impact on popular consciousness (see Barber, 1972).</page><page sequence="11">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 181 revolutionary ones-for a very long time. The variable timing of turns may be played for strategic advantage. For example, one actor's turns may be speeded up and another's delayed through promises or threats. Such future oriented actions control present behavior through dummy moves that defer real response till a later time. In social and political life, the natural logic of actions may dictate something similar to turns. Thus, an actor may not be able to undertake later actions before laying the groundwork with earlier ones. Earlier actions of another actor may represent powerful influences on current behavior. This, however, is far from saying that the order of individual moves is tightly, logically, or empirically determined. Further, for Axelrod's players, each turn contains the same payoff structure. This is not true for other aspects of life, in which risks and opportunities may vary at different points in interaction sequences. Many of the turns may be irrelevant, and the final outcome may depend on one or a few critical rounds, rather than the cumulative total of all rounds. One is reminded of General MacArthur's dictum that it is only important to win one battle-the last. Axelrod's game suggests the importance of event time, rather than chronological time. Nevertheless, social interactions do not necessarily take place in equal units, spaced equally apart. There may be important asymmetries, in which action units and time spaces between them differ. Axelrod recognizes this in his discussion of variable frequency of interactions (pp. 129-130, 180). In addition, life often contains gaps or overlaps. These result from varying response time-premature or tardy behavior-multiple or missed action opportunities. Such gaps may actually be part of the actors' strategic calcu- lations. Decision makers may not always perceive an appropriate action, and may choose "to leave the ball" in the other actor's "court," or "pass." Problems in timing may dramatically affect the structure of interaction by confusing such questions as who defected when. Parents of siblings know that "(s)he started it" usually obscures far more than it reveals. Or, in the case of a preemptive nuclear strike, one actor may defect before the opponent has actually made the first conflictual move. A preemptive first strike may flood the opposing field in response to an impending but still unrealized action. Events data analysis suggests a possible inventory of action units that we might conceivably take for moves. Nevertheless, there are alternative codings at higher and lower levels of magnification. Many actions, particularly in informal relations between people, may be subtle-a sigh, a frown-or implicit-an unmade rejoinder, an unasked question. A nonexistent action, like Sherlock Holmes' dog that did not bark, may be critical. Such nonactions may continue over time: for example, when spouses do not speak, or nations do not fight. Should we code all of these individual actions, microactions, and nonactions discretely? Should we code the whole matrix of possible alternative actions at each time point to get at nonactions? Should we group the actions in chunks? If so, where should we draw the boundaries? Or would aggregate streams of action</page><page sequence="12">182 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION be a better conceptualization? And who should decide; do particular actors or observers necessarily perceive "correctly" the vast inventory of action and nonaction opportunities? In Axelrod's game, furthermore, there are only two possible moves, C or D, that the players can make. Obviously this is a vast simplification to achieve analytic focus. Nevertheless, it leaves us with the problem of how variable degrees of cooperation and conflict are to be interpreted and coded. There is still no commonly accepted and completely validated and reliable interval scale of cooperation and conflict. The significance of the same objective action may, furthermore, vary dramatically with its context. We are all familiar with minimal or symbolic cooperation-cooperation in form, defection in substance. The reverse also takes place, for example when a legislator casts a negative vote on a bill that is sure to pass. And who is to resolve perceptual differences in coding between actors, partners, and observers with varying degrees of involvement? Conflict and cooperation are not the only dimensions of actions. Behavior may occur for different reasons, for example external social or professional norms. "Let the chips fall where they may," or "don't take it personally," are common remarks that attempt to recognize these other considerations and also to downgrade the conflict-cooperation dimension. There may be external causes or extenuating circumstances as in "it wasn't my fault," or "I couldn't help it." In Axelrod's game, there are multiple players, but only two clearly defined, homogeneous, stable actors play each other at one time. It is, of course, no great revelation to suggest that N may be greater than two. Many real life multiplayer contests may be reducible into sequential or simultaneous dyadic contests. Or they can be collapsed into larger two player coalition contests. Nevertheless, nagging problems remain. Axelrod's game has clear sides, consisting of one player each. Yet, in the real world the sides often do not have clear identities. There may be no clear difference between sides. Players devote considerable resources to propaganda, public relations, and diplomatic entertainment designed to represent their adversaries as isolated as possible, and themselves supported by large majorities. Further, identities change over time. For example, in the international political world, actors have multiplied, as empires and nations have divided: the Soviet Republics, two Germanies, Koreas, Vietnams; postcolonial nations or their fragmentary parts; various other microstates-products of war, decolonization, secession, or revolution- international organizations, pressure groups, and political and nonpolitical office holders and candidates, and even private personalities have jostled each other for legitimacy and recognition. Further, some of these overlap in time and space. Regimes in power contend with governments in exile-for example, the two Chinas. Different actors are proxies, shadow participants, acting in the name of real players. And there are nonplayers who play by refusing to play- conscientious objectors, pacifists, or revolutionaries.</page><page sequence="13">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 183 This identity problem is related to the assumption of strategic unity, which has long been a limiting assumption of game theory. In Axelrod's game, there is only one player, with one clearly defined strategy, on each side. In the external world, however, there may be many subactors trying to play for each superordinate actor. Our knowledge of bureaucratic politics, and relations within secondary and primary groups suggests that sometimes one subactor is in control with one strategy, sometimes another. Sometimes, compromises mix the strategies. These subactors may balance their external and internal payoffs in such a way that they promote within-group cooperation at the expense of outside conflict. There may be conflicts of interest between players on the inside, outside, and those with overlapping membership. Cooperative and conflictual relations across all these sets may not be transitive. In Axelrod's game, furthermore, the players have equivalent resources. Each controls symmetrical rewards and punishments for self and opponent. In other aspects of life, the players often have very different resources, both in terms of the fundamental capability inventories, and what they are able to bring to bear on a particular situation in a specific time and place. As Axelrod recognizes, this is typically the case in hierarchical social structures in which power, wealth, and prestige are highly centralized at the top of the social pyramid and distributed downward only to a very limited extent (pp. 145-150). Thus the cost of reward (C) for one party may be very slight. Or that actor may be able to provide rewards that seem very large for the others, at marginally low costs. The differential costs of specific forms of cooperation is well recognized in theories of economic specialization and comparative advantage, as well as in the practice of political patronage and foreign aid. Equal CC between parents and children is not realistic. The costs of retaliation may be exorbitant against a much stronger opponent. Actors may not always be able to afford to reciprocate. If they are very unequal, a symmetrical exchange may be out of the question, as Axelrod recognizes in his mention of "the futility of isolated revolt" (p. 150). A DD retaliation might even eliminate one actor. For example, in a nuclear war between the United States and Nicaragua, the United States would be relatively unharmed, whereas Nicaragua might be totally destroyed.5 We come now to the problem of payoffs or preferences. Why is the preference ordering of Axelrod's PD the correct one for all of the situations to which Axelrod applies TFT? Why not Chicken, which many analysts believe to be a more appropriate conceptualization for many situations, deterrence, for example? Indeed, why not many of the other members of the large set of 78 distinct games with strictly ranked ordinal preferences or of the over 700 possible games without such strict ordering?6 There may be some situations, 5. Such resource differences might be modeled through variations in w, or a related parameter. 6. Kilgour and Fraser (1985) is the most recent entry in the debate over the exact number.</page><page sequence="14">184 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION nuclear war, for example, that may imply disutilities that verge on the infinite. How might TFT do in such other theoretical situations? Do ordinary actors usually have ordinally ranked preferences? Under which circumstances might other games be appropriate? Which game does each player perceive? These questions suggest directions for further research on metagames and social psychological dynamics (see Plous, 1985). Axelrod's game provides perfect information of a limited sort, the other player's moves. This characteristic relaxes earlier PD communication restric- tions, and it is essential to strategic calculations. Without such information, TFT would have no response criterion. At the same time, it is at some distance from other aspects of life. Thus, actors often are ignorant in varying degrees of others' behavior. Part of the trouble comes from simple confusion. There are serious problems with incoming information. In the modern world, there is a vast flood of news that often threatens to drown the players. Some of the difficulty has come from advances in technologies as well as the expansion of public and private bureaucracies. Many observers have charged that this information overload has had an important influence in producing suboptimal decision making in various different environments. As early as 1919, Harold Nicolson wrote that "the trouble with the Paris conference was not that there was too little information, but that there was far too much" (1933: 25). Inconsistencies and contradictions occur. Much information is spurious, the result of sloppiness, concealment, partial truths, or lies. The manipulation of this information, or misinformation, has important strategic implications both within and between groups (see Brams, 1977). Even if one were to assume that the incoming signals were relatively reasonable in number and pure in content, there are additional problems of perception and recognition, of which Axelrod is obviously well aware through his previous work. These involve differential states of activation and attention, as well as filtering and simplification. Cognitive maps translate facts, data, stimuli of the external world into familiar schemas of knowledge and belief. At some point, perceptions are stored for later use. TFT implies very limited "memory of only one move" (p. 58). Competing strategies with longer memories fared less well in the contest. Axelrod does not explicitly generalize this finding in his major policy recommendations, but it obviously implies fairly radical social and individual change. On the one hand, extensive and accurate short- term recall must handle the taxing burden of accurate bookkeeping in relations with many actors across different sectors of activity. If interaction frequency is low, then short-term memory may still have to extend far back in chronological time. On the other hand, long-term memory storage over event time is truncated. The new person and the new society emerge at least partly lobotomized, with substantially reduced long-term event recall. The past has virtually no content. It may be true that we should be better off with more limited memories. Modern societies appear to follow this evolutionary path by placing less store on past history, for example, than earlier, more traditional cultures. Further, we</page><page sequence="15">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 185 recognize the desirability of forgetting through various practices such as file destruction, bankruptcy, and criminal probation. Nevertheless, it is difficult to imagine assuming memory content to be virtually completely eliminated. What horrors for archivists, archaeologists, historians, librarians, and museum curators, to say nothing of connoisseurs of old art, buildings, cheeses, manuscripts, and wines. Axelrod's game implies an interesting model of learning. TFT starts in a positive way, but after that it distributes both positive and negative rein- forcements, depending on the actions of its partner. There is no change in the central strategic algorithm, but a kind of learning does occur. TFT is able to use the lessons of past experience to adapt future behavior. The system as a whole learns, or evolves through the positive reinforcement of the winning population, survival and multiplication of the winners. Finally, Axelrod's game includes sharply defined outcomes and termination points, even when the endings are determined by probabilities. In other areas of life again the situation can be more complex. Outcomes are not necessarily sharply defined by point awards. Often it is unclear who is winning or losing. There is no clear termination, no point when the game is over and the results can be tallied up. At any moment, actors may see prosperity around the corner, light at the end of the tunnel. The lessons of history, the attributes of the fittest, and the course of evolution are not always obvious. THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION THEORY The Evolution of Cooperation is itself a step in the evolution of cooperation theory. It falls clearly within the standard logical empirical scientific paradigm, while at the same time helping to extend it. Theoretically the model moves forward from static conceptions of game theory. The contest is a nicely constructed computer simulation experiment, even though the theory does not strictly precede it. The competing programs are internally consistent, and the results are robust. The findings can usefully be applied in describing, explaining, and predicting a part of reality. The simplifications of the general model make it easily applicable to a wide variety of situations involving "conditional strategies of behavior" (p. 18). Nevertheless, the model has vices implied by its virtues. Its simplicity is one of its major assets, but this cuts two ways. On the one hand, parsimony is usually considered to be an asset in developing a general theory. Accepted models of elegance and efficiency urge us to be spare, to analyze the most with the least, to illuminate the essence rather than the epiphenomena of reality. Nevertheless, simplicity by itself is not enough. Unless the model's kernel can be expanded to include the vast array of real world phenomena, it implies a reduction that loses a great deal of important and valuable information-that excludes or distorts life rather than reflecting it.</page><page sequence="16">186 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION Axelrod recognizes this and seeks to extend his research by generalizing from computer simulation to other types of systems with more complex structures and processes. Yet isomorphism with other aspects of experience is incomplete (see Bekey, 1985); the world is much richer and more intricate than the game's limiting assumptions. As we have already suggested, TFT implies a very thin model of human nature. The personalization of TFT suggests a kind of homunculus in the machine, reminiscent of neuroanatomy, though with less empirical foundation. Further, the extension of TFT to higher and lower levels of systems runs the danger of committing ecological fallacies at several levels of analysis (see Simon, 1985; Shubik, 1984: 123-124). Of course, everything is relative, and nothing is perfect. To many people the model's apparent generalizability, its commonality with many aspects of political reality, may seem to outweigh its areas of distinctness. All theorizing, including model building, requires simplification. No theory or model can, or should be expected to, deal with every possible aspect of interaction. Deficiencies are endemic to the application of "pure" game theory, or any general abstract theory, to the messier and more complex real world. The outline of the model's limitations may thus seem like nitpicking, selecting the chaff from the wheat. Yet goodness of fit is no trivial matter. It is an important part of the ongoing debate over the definition of political reality and, ultimately, over its formation. This discussion is concerned with the correct or true description, explanation, and prediction of our world. It also has an important normative dimension. Without wishing to overstate the case for "the playing fields of Eton," it seems reasonable that the games on which we focus contain implicit guides to action. The adoption of PD and TFT as the correct models for a large number and variety of situations would seriously influence the way in which actors see and behave. We may thus ask whether life should imitate science? Is the book also a step ahead for cooperation itself? Some of the normative consequences might be beneficial. Thus, our world would be simpler, though poorer, if we had agreed rules, limited and stable inventories of actors and actions, regular turns, explicit and clearly ordered preferences, accurate information and perception, limited memory, determinate outcomes, and finite endings. Further, Axelrod's "advice to participants and reformers" on effective choice is reminiscent of some of the sage counsel pioneered earlier in the Earl of Chesterfield's letters to his son. This genre has flowered more recently in whole libraries of "how to" books in popular psychology and interpersonal relations, many of which have also used a games analogy. Axelrod's admonitions that we should not be too envious or conflictual, that we should enlarge our vision of the future, that we should try to influence others' calculations of risk and reward, teach caring and reciprocity, and improve the accuracy of our perceptions agree well with common sense. His suggestion that we should not be too clever takes the edge off competition and</page><page sequence="17">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 187 insubordination, though it suggests a patronizing attitude that again smacks a little of the 19th century. Axelrod's game might well help to bring order out of apparent chaos and create a more cooperative environment. At the same time, an uncritical acceptance and extrapolation-assuming that TFT will win in life as it did in the laboratory-can bring us to the border of dangerous territory. We may confuse global with local solutions and assume that TFT is the fittest strategy in all contexts and sequences. In this case, we might believe that it should survive and prosper in all environments in which we expect significant future interaction. This is not necessarily true, and if we expect this outcome, we may be unpleasantly surprised. Alternatively, if this assumption of general success were correct, and we carried the process to its extreme, it would imply a generally continuous and nonreversible dynamic, a perpetual motion machine that gathered energy and never experienced entropy or decay. The theoretical and empirical end point of this progress would be a world of uniform and unalloyed cooperation, which seems hard to swallow. On the road to cooperation, two of Axelrod's homilies call for us to reciprocate defection as well as cooperation. It does seem reasonable that actors should suffer the logical consequences of their misbehavior, and pay a price for it. Yet this is also the stuff of classical tragedy, and Axelrod recognizes it as "a serious problem with TIT FOR TAT." He makes pointed reference to undamped conflict echoes of continuing feuds, whose origins eventually become lost in time. The answer is to relax the actual assumptions of TFT and substitute an asymmetrical response for strict reciprocity. Thus Axelrod believes that the "slightly unsavory taste" of TFT's "rough justice" can be masked by being "a bit more forgiving." He continues: The punishment might fit the crime without having to be as painful as the crime itself was.... A better strategy might be to return only nine-tenths of a tit for a tat [pp. 137-138]. This goes beyond the "pure" lesson of tit-for-tat, upon which much of the book is actually based, although it is consistent with tit-for-two-tats, which is briefly discussed. Nevertheless, it does not solve the basic difficulty of applying the game and its associated strategies outside the laboratory. The unclear structure and process of life remain. To them is added the difficulty of trying to calculate a continuing series of changing proportions. Proportional reciprocity is more complex than simple reciprocity, but still implies problems of manipulation, exploitation, and recrimination that TFT should theoretically help to avoid. Asymmetrical exchanges allow the extraction of surplus value. Thus, Axelrod discusses the deteriorated performance of tit-for-two-tats in later tournament rounds by "rules that were able to exploit its</page><page sequence="18">188 JOURNAL OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION willingness to forgive isolated defections," for example, "alternating defection with cooperation" (pp. 1 9-120, 151). A more concrete example might be a case of preemptive cooperation, in which one actor rushes to provide favors in the hope-often unrealized-of later gratitude or leverage. Another perspective on the same interaction is that of action substitution. An actor may do a substantial patronage favor with significant impact on the recipient's life. The other reciprocates in a small way-a thank you note, an invitation.'Or perhaps more substantially, but not with something that the first actor values very highly. Is the obligation of CC released? If not, what level of recipient reciprocity is required? And what is the appropriate attitude of the patron, or donor, while waiting? Further, there are some situations in which even proportional defection may imply the most catastrophic decisions. In the world of formal games, D does not sound too bad. Consequences are scored in terms of abstract points in an experiment, and even these exist only for the players themselves. This language suggests a bloodless kind of game, a mere extension of chess or checkers. In other areas of life, D can appear as very different. If we try to apply this model to international relations, the stakes can be very high. For example, it has obvious relevance to deterrence and warfighting. Though Axelrod does not do so, one might easily decode D into reciprocal thermonuclear devastation. Current strategic doctrine allows us easily to conceive of a D that involves a strike on one or several major industrial centers. This action may doom tens, perhaps hundreds of millions, to horrible agonies and deaths.7 Proportional retaliation may help to reduce the overall level of damage, which is good, but it does not necessarily eliminate it. Perhaps the mentioned strike is in response to a slightly larger attack, or number of attacks. In such a case, the abstract calculations for proportional retaliation may not be very difficult to make. Thus past, present, and future casualties might be appropriately discounted and added to provide inputs. An additive assumption toward human life may imply, for example, that ten lives are ten times as valuable as one life. There is also an implicit transformation formula between lives and other values, particularly national territory and economic resources. 7. Axelrod himself (1985) is not eager to apply PD or TFTto nuclear crises, which he believes may be better modeled as Chicken. Nevertheless, the book does not make clear what tests we might use to determine reliably when PD/TFT are and are not appropriate in concrete situations that imply ambiguous or multidimensional payoffs. The book's discussion of arms races and trench warfare seem to point, by extension, toward PD/ TFT as a possible model for military situations. Indeed, Axelrod does discuss applications to deterrence (pp. 146, 150-154). Many other analysts also see nuclear war in PD terms, with global nuclear devastation as punishment for mutual defection. And TFT has an independent set of ordinary language meanings, some of which apply to nuclear war. For example, Wohlstetter (1985: 973) refers to a "'tit for tat'response in the stereotype of mutual escalation." Beyond the question of the most appropriate abstract preference structures and strategies for different issue areas lies a larger question-the action implications of different forms of symbolic representation. The human consequences involved in applying game models of any kind to these situations need to be considered very carefully.</page><page sequence="19">Beer / GAMES AND METAPHORS 189 Life may not necessarily be cheap, but it is certainly not priceless. Every man, woman, and child carries a proportional price on his or her head. Proportional retaliation, moreover, provides no determinate solutions. It still leaves open the question of the specific referent of the proportion. We may, for example, imagine a scenario in which United States decision makers had undertaken a "surgical" strike to preempt what they had decided was an imminent Soviet attack. Soviet decision makers, feeling that the United States had defected first, decide to launch a proportionate response that includes both military and civilian targets. Among these are three American cities. Which ones? Even if we exclude Washington, D.C. for the time being, this still leaves a vast array of potential combinations, with no determinate solution. Charleston, St. Louis, and San Diego? Minneapolis-St. Paul, Kansas City, Houston? New York, Chicago, San Francisco? And even a proportionally limited response still implies the atmospheric and climactic possibilities of nuclear winter. Finally, we must face the question of how far we should allow our own actions to be determined by others. What are we to do if faced with an uncooperative partner, more perverse or less scientifically advanced than we? Allow our own behavior to be totally reactive? Mimic this retarded double and abandon many of our most cherished religious, philosophical, and cultural values while resigning ourselves to the inevitable destruction of civilization? My intent here has generally been positive, but some of my remarks may seem harsh. Criticism can appear like a cruel stepsister to the beautiful Cinderella of creativity. Yet I believe there is a contemporary inclination toward the mystification of science and scientists. This tendency makes necessary a thorough deconstruction of scientific work, carefully balancing its contributions and limitations. This is most important when that work has received major attention. Axelrod has overcome some preexisting limitations in game theory. I think that the positive achievements outweigh the imperfections. It is to his credit that he himself recognizes, and deals with, many of the still existing limitations to his own work. Indeed, the differences between Axelrod's game and the real world may reveal more than the similarities. The Evolution of Cooperation fills in some gaps, but it reveals more. Thus, one of Axelrod's most important contributions is to suggest many theoretical and empirical questions for our collective research agenda. In addition to those discussed above are the critical junctures of discrete event simulation with more aggregated dynamic process-modeling and game theory with behavioral research. We live in a relativistic world. Nothing is perfect. Games do not faithfully represent life, either in general or in its political, economic, social, or cultural dimensions. They cannot yet carry the whole, or probably even a major part, of our collective analysis. They can illuminate certain aspects of reality, perhaps as well as any other abstract type of model. Nevertheless, there is still a great deal of theoretical development to be done, and missing data to be collected, before we</page><page sequence="20">190 JOURNAL OF CONFLICTRESOLUTION can reasonably apply them to the accurate description, explanation, and prediction of our extremely intricate and subtle world. At one point, Axelrod (p. 137) states that "the real issue is whether there are any better alternatives." If one were to follow the recommendations of concept theory, to which we earlier referred, this might imply a comprehensive and detailed comparison of the features of Axelrod's game and other prototypes, including both abstract and experientially based models. Such an analysis would be most interesting, It would systematically weigh different models' similarities and differences with particular real world situations. In the absence of such evaluation, it would be premature to recode too much of our experience. Games imply not only observation, but are also in themselves a form of action. They relate the world of the observer to the world that is observed; but it is not always clear which takes precedence. We change our world subtly by observing it through a particular set of lenses. We draw action conclusions from our experiments. We need to bear in mind not only the lessons, but also the limits of Axelrod's game. In spite of its tantalizing insights, we should be very cautious about applying and playing it outside the laboratory. We are still very far from the point at which this game, or any other, can be confidently used as a general and complete metaphor for cooperation in life. REFERENCES AXELROD, R.
