<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing in Eltit s Lumpérica KATE JENCKES Reed College THE TRUTH THAT WE LIVE IN URGENT TIMES HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR AS LONG as anyone can remember. Under such circumstances, sitting back and read- ing a book, a work of literature, might seem to be ultimately apolitical, dis- missive of the world and its very immediate problems - poverty, war, oppression. It would be like the figure of Borges at the end of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," when the world is being taken over by a particularly nefari- ous kind of idealism, and the narrator describes himself as sitting quietly in a suburban hotel, attempting to finish a translation of Brownes "Urne- Buriall."1 It is easy to consider literature (reading, writing, or translating) to be a form of turning ones back to the real world - literature understood as "Literature," that is: canonical, revered works, objects that presume closure and self-identification, monuments of culture. In a talk delivered recently at Duke University, the Argentine critic Nicolás Casullo referred to the impor- tance of "writing or literature" in face of the catastrophe of modern exis- tence.2 This was received by the majority of the audience as an admission of failure of revolutionary projects or, in the worst of cases, as a conservative • 67</page><page sequence="2">68 • The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing approach to the world, an escape to the protected space of the written word while the rest of the world falls to pieces. Taking this misunderstanding as perhaps symptomatic of a trend in cultural criticism today, this essay will address the question of how literature relates to politics, and in particular to what Jean-Luc Nancy has described as the essence of the political: commu- nity. These questions will be posed in relation to the field of U.S. Latin Americanism, a field in which literature and writing have in recent years been regarded with suspicion, or when embraced, tend to be read as testi- monies of lived experience. Against such a prosopopeic regionalism, I will consider the Chilean writer Diamela Eltit s novel, Lumpérica, as an example of how the figuration of community is represented not as an object distinct from language, but precisely in and through writing itself. Nancy defines the political as the place where community as such is brought into play. He explains the Left as a politics that is receptive to the possibilities of community, while the Right is that which approaches the notion of community through order and administration.3 He considers writ- ing to be inherently political, an intrinsic part of both politics and commu- nity. Writing is defined as that which "speaks" or strains toward community, or which serves as testimony to community s absence, or perhaps both simultaneously - the absence not canceling out the remote possibility, the possibility not necessarily signifying an absence. In this sense, Nancy sug- gests, writing is intimately related to revolution, understanding revolution not as the foundation of a new order, but as something that happens in an ongoing present. Both Nancy and Casullo use the terms "writing" and "literature" inter- changeably as forms of relating to the political urgencies of the world. It is tempting to try to distinguish two fundamentally different phenomena here. The two words have different resonances, both of them equally disagreeable to current critical tastes. 'Writing* brings Derrida and deconstruction to mind; and the word 'literature may have a variety of associations, but prima- rily it conjures up the idea of canonical literature - texts produced in privi- leged circumstances, protected from and unconcerned with the world around them. Yet when we think of writing as that which "calls to" community, we might agree that we cannot do without writing, and furthermore that we our-</page><page sequence="3">Kate Jenckes • 69 selves (critics, students, professors) are engaged in long and committed processes of writing, and that writing also serves an important function in the communities about which we write. On the other hand, writing is an activity that is practiced in solitude. Its practice may have effects outside of that solitude, but it is not usually exercised commonly, in groups. This is an argument that has been made against it, even when the end product seems justified. It may then be literature, rather than writing, that calls forth com- munity. Literature would describe the product of writing insomuch as it is available, disseminable, to a community: it would be the product of writing that, passed around and read, can form different articulations of community. However, Nancy argues that literature cannot define community in this way. It cannot define anything per se, and in this sense is much more related to writing than to literature understood as a finished and self-enclosed work Community, for Nancy, is described as something that enacts an "infinite resistance to everything that would bring it to completion," and literature- or writing - would be a place where this infinite resistance is inscribed (Nancy, xxvii). Literature is written out of what Nancy calls the passion of finitude: "the passion of a singular being drawn to its limits and drawing out those limits, communicating them as the limits of community itself." Community is not conceived as a gathering of singularities around a given object, a body that imagines itself into being around a literary work- that perceives a sense of identity reflected in its thingness, the apparent comple- tion of the literary product. On the contrary, community is precisely that which, necessarily incomplete and incompletable, finds one of its most important representations in the work, or as Nancy puts it, the unwork, of literature. Literature does not function as a banner to be flown over differ- ent segments of community; it is not an interpellative object that draws diverse elements into a recognizable collectivity. It is something that repre- sents an ongoing questioning of the possibility of such a collectivity, a ques- tioning that at the same time implies its impossibility and its necessity: the necessity of representing the impossibility of community, which is at the same time the only possibility of community (71). That literature in this sense enacts a performance of sorts, a praxis, would suggest that what we mean by literature is really better described by</page><page sequence="4">70 • The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing that other word, writing- more evidently an action, a process that involves an ongoing contact, a brushing against the limits of every singularity and every collectivity that would pretend to unify its elements into a single iden- tity. Writing describes an activity that defies closure; it is ongoing, "revolu- tionary," whereas literature, the product of writing, would seem to be static. Written texts, however, are anything but static. As Benjamin would be the first to remind us, literary works have a "life" of their own, a life which is not organic, limited to a single body, but rather, a life which is always an after- life ( Überleben , Fortleben ),4 an ongoing iterability that defies all natural metaphors of coherence, that transforms and is transformed according to no progressive scheme.5 In this sense, literature is not the static product of writing, but is writing itself. Writing has no terminal product; what it pro- duces is more writing. Nancy indicates this with a play on the word "work" (oeuvre) of literature, which he neologizes into "unwork" or "unworking" (i desoeuvre , desoeuvrer)- the "work" of literature which is also always a "working," which is to say an unworking of the very notion of a finite "work." Literature as such interrupts literature itself: it destroys the myth of appar- ent communion between writing subject and any finite and definitive prod- uct, between author and work. In Latin American studies, particularly as it has been received and con- stituted in the United States, the rejection or suspicion of literature has had to do with seeing literature as a passive object that doesn't do anything, that just sits around and collects, as Borges might say, the dust of history. Or alternatively (although not incompatibly), it consists of seeing literature involved in a very different kind of work: the work of literature as an opera- tion of state machinery, which involves the constitution of community or nation in a most brutal and hierarchic way. This was Angel Ramas influen- tial thesis: that literature in Latin America is, as it always was, an apparatus of state constitution. The question at stake is whether literature is only that, only a state (or state and market) apparatus, and if not, how it might work to interrupt the social and political machinery of which it is a part. Almost everyone, I believe, would agree that this is a possibility: even the more hard-line Ramians would accept that literature can be a place of resist- ance to ideological claims to social totality. The quasi-genre of the testimonial</page><page sequence="5">Kate Jenckes # 71 is representative here. Whether or not we want to consider the testimonio itself to be a genre of literature per se, it is undeniable that much "literature" these days is perceived as a kind of testimony, a representation of lived expe- rience,6 whether biographical or autobiographical: one that assumes, at least to some extent, the autonomy of the subject, the narratability of experience, and the relationship between that individual experience and a certain con- ception of community- a community of shared experience, formed against and in the gaps of social totality. It is an individual T or we that speaks against the collective we s of the nation, state, market, or globe. But literature, Nancy insists, cannot demand or declare community as a "call, invocation, or proclamation" (71). It cannot produce community as its own work. It is not the product of a subject who calls to community or speaks for a collectivity (representing women's voices, for example). Literature itself "strains toward community," or calls to it, or represents com- munity's own call, understanding the figure of the call not as subjective expression, not as a human creation, but as precisely that which calls from beyond the limits of human or subjective existence, which interrogates the autonomy of any call we might think that we make. In that sense, literature consists "only in the act that interrupts, with a single stroke - by an incision and/or an inscription - the shaping of the scene of myth": the myth of sub- jective autonomy, of the communion of community, and of the power of the autonomous subject to will such communion into being. In a recent essay on Paul de Mans and Louis Althusser s relations to the political dimensions of art, Michael Sprinker defines two kinds of aesthetics: one which, following de Man, is called an aesthetic ideology or an ideologi- cal aesthetic, and one that has the potential of breaking the ideological domain of that kind of aesthetic.7 The former (ideological) kind of aesthetic has what Sprinker calls a "protective, sheltering function" (36): it turns us "tropologically" away from the disordered multiplicity of existence to a sem- blance of order that we allow ourselves to take as an object, a movement which also constitutes us as subjects. De Man cites Pascal to demonstrate what he means by an ideological effect of tropology: Pascal explains how, "on hearing the expression 'time,' all turn (literally carry') the mind toward the same entity ( tous portent la pensée vers le même objet)" (cited in Sprinker,</page><page sequence="6">72 # The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing 33). This tropic or vector-like quality of language involves not only an inter- pellation of the referred object, a call to the object, but also the constitution of individuals as subjects: subjects that form part of a 'tous that turns towards the projected object. Far from poetic or figurative language (what we usually think of when we think of tropes) being the most complicit in this respect, Althusser asserts that it is precisely the assumption of the transparent nature of language that most turns our heads: The category of the subject is a primary obviousness ( évidence ) ... ; it is clear that you and I are subjects Like all obviousnesses, including those that make a word name a thing' or 'have a meaning' (therefore including the obviousnesses of the 'transparency' of language), this obviousness' that you and I are subjects ... is an ideological effect, the elementary ideological effect. It is in effect the very nature of ideology that it imposes (without appearing to do so, since these are obviousnesses') obviousnesses as obvi- ousnesses, which we cannot fail to recognize." (Cited in Sprinker, 34-35) This process involves a double kind of identification, or prosopopeia. We put a face on what we see: we convert perception into concept, aesthetics thus understood as an enclosure or comprehension of what we see (the word aes- thetics derives from the Greek aesthanumai, meaning perception), which in turn gives us a face - both us as individual subjects and us as communi- cating community, the ' tous who know where to turn when we hear a given word, who are able to share in the obviousness of language. There is, however, another kind of "aesthetic" (or relationship of repre- sentation to perception), which de Man calls a "materialist" aesthetic and Althusser calls "anti-humanism." In both cases, this aesthetic amounts to a kind of anti-aesthetic, in the sense that it does not involve taking perception (i aesthanumai ) as a definable reality, translating or turning it into the com- forting appearance of meaning, but precisely interrupts the completion of all such transformation. Althusser illustrates this counter-aesthetic with the example of the Italian painter Leonardo Cremonini s late paintings. Similar to de Mans description of a poetic materialism,8 Althusser describes how</page><page sequence="7">Kate Jenckes • 73 Cremonini s paintings function as a mirror that reflects precisely the failed desire for a reflection of a coherent human subjectivity, what he calls the "ideological illusion par excellence, . . . 'humanism'" (cited in Sprinker, 40). This is evident in the figures of deformed faces that emerge in Cremonini s late work: Strictly speaking, the deformation to which Cremonini subjects his faces is a determinate deformation, in that it does not replace one identity with another on the same face, does not give the faces one particular "expression" (of the soul, of the subject) instead of another: it takes all expression away from them, and with it, the ideological function which that expression ensures in the complicities of the humanist ideology of art. . . . Cremonini s human faces are such that they cannot be seen, i.e., identified as bearers of the ideological function of the expression of subjects. (Cited in Sprinker, 40) What this defacement achieves, what Cremonini s paintings make visible, is the abstraction of the very figure of face: the face as face , mask, or trope, rather than the expression of a subjective essence. In connection with this concept of an anti-humanist aesthetic, as well as Nancy s understanding of literature s non-human "call" to community, I will discuss briefly a text that has occupied a central position in recent discus- sions of late twentieth-century Latin American literature, especially in Latin Americanist circles that have tended to reject or disprivilege literature as such, or that consider it as an example of an expression or testimonial of lived experience. I refer to Diamela Eltiťs 1983 experimentalist novel, Lum- périca. Considering her neo-avant garde, highly literary style, the popularity of Eltit s writings in a moment in which "high" literature tends to be avoided in favor of more direct and concrete forms of popular expression is some- what perplexing. Nevertheless, she is currently regarded as one of the pri- mary writers of the Southern Cone, a fame that, at least in the United States, may have less to do with the nature of the texts themselves than with the conditions under which they were produced - a woman writing under the Pinochet regime - and their consequent transformation into a form of testi- mony, an expression of personal or communal experience.9 The texts have</page><page sequence="8">74 # The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing been welcomed as a human remainder to the dehumanizing conditions of power under the Chilean dictatorship: a solitary voice, the voice of one who could nonetheless represent the suffering experienced by many; someone who could give a face to a general suffering. Eltit s novel poses the representation of community as a principle theme. The neologistic title contains the fragmented remains of at least two possi- ble formations of community: lumpen and America, and possibly a third, woman, from the slang word "perica" (or, as someone has suggested, from the name "Érica").10 The books scenes alternate between scenes of radical isolation of the text s protagonist, L. Iluminada, and scenes of immersion among crowds of fellow citizens: nameless passers-by, nighttime indigents. They are frequently described as pale and faceless. It has been suggested that she, L. Iluminada, provides a face for those masses that surround her: that the book represents a "dream of prosopopeic communion" (Avelar, 185). Djelal Kadir writes: The lumpen of America in Eltit s Lumpérica has its personification, its iron- ically and paradoxically unmasked prosopopeia, in the female figure of the novels protagonist, L. Iluminada. A glaring figure that in turn glares, she is illumined starkness that sheds her institutional vestments so that by her light the destitutional remnants might come to life, take on discursive weight and political visibility, breach their ghostliness, reclaim their banished real- ity, and do so at the spatial and symbolic center of society's habitat, the town square. (Cited in Avelar, 170) Idelber Avelar reads the representation of the lumpen in the figure of the protagonist with greater complexity, less banished "ghostliness." Quoting Eugenia Brito, he asserts, "'writing in Lumpérica submerges (se sumerge) in three crossroads: woman, lumpen, and america.' Eltit associates a minori- tarian and indigent america.' . . . with a female body where makeup and wound converge" (171). In spite of a shifting and discontinuous narrative, a submersion or 'drowning' of writing in different figures of collective identification, a body emerges to represent the nameless, faceless masses that float through this city square in Santiago, Chile. She is almost nameless,</page><page sequence="9">Kate Jenckes • 75 almost faceless as well - she is cut, bleeding, made-up - marginalized like the rest, but her face stands out to represent the injured masses behind her. In a world in which the illuminating gaze of the state and market floods the public space of the plaza (represented here by an illuminated signboard that writes its message onto the pale faces of the people who pass by), one small, weakened figure comes forth and manages to call into being the wounded body of America behind her. It is a "dream of prosopopeic communion": a dream in which community is called into being as a body by a single body. It is then, as Nancy suggested, literature: the literary figure of the protago- nist, and the figure of the author as well, call to community - strain forth to community from a position of solitude, from the limits of the individual. But as we have seen, Nancy explains that no "one" can do that - call, proclaim, invoke, declare community into being. For him, literatures "call to commu- nity" is entirely different. It is never a subjective utterance, but an interrup- tion: "an incision and/or an inscription." L. Iluminada does "call" to her companions. In a central chapter in the book, she calls out in the form of a question: "Quo vadis? Where are you going?" (Eltit, 97). It would seem that this would be the beginning of a "dream of prosopopeic communion." By asking the question, she also answers it, the question itself functioning as an answer. Writing "you" (tú) in chalk under the feet of the passers-by, she calls them into an identity, if still an indeterminate one, and confirms that they are indeed a someone or something (perico) going somewhere- perhaps not unlike the signboard that hands out identities, that prints its message on the faces of "los páli- dos." The question "Quo vadis?" implies "you are someone, and you are going somewhere," and could suggest as well: "Since you are someone, why not come with me? I too am someone, I too am going somewhere." Nonetheless the question, written in chalk on the plazas floor, does not serve as the same kind of writing into existence as the signboard. It does not constitute a prosopopeic communion, with L. Iluminada functioning as an interrogator who asks the plazas passing community where it is going and thereby calls it into being as community, naming the individuals (tú) as a single body (tú). Rather, her question, her call to community, is represented in chalked letters on the plazas surface, an ephemeral material written</page><page sequence="10">76 • The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing beneath the feet of the passing people, who themselves "answer" not as a collective body, through a collective mouth, but with their feet, as itself a kind of writing (114-17). A writing that stamps out an answer by stamping out the question itself, showing that "I, we are going here," without ever pro- claiming it either individually or collectively- showing only, through the traipsing over the questions figures, and their gradual alteration and ero- sion, that "at best we are going somewhere"; that "at best there is some we here somewhere"; that there is a commonness in the works, but one that can not be summed up by any proper name (America, lumpen, woman) nor rep- resented by a single figure, personified by one who wonders aloud where it might be going.11 It is going someplace, and coming, inasmuch as it goes: a coming com- munity. After both L. Iluminadas and the public s words and marks have been entirely rubbed out, belonging to neither- invoking neither individual nor collective as any sort of way out - the words, the call, the possibility of community belong only to the future. The last line in the chapter explains that the writing in the plaza has served only that "that whole square could finally store up the ink to repeat other writings" ("pudiera almacenar la tinta para repetir otros escritos") (117). Nancy writes, "Community without com- munion] is to come , in the sense that it is always coming, endlessly, at the heart of every collectivity (because it never stops coming, it ceaselessly resists collectivity itself as much as it resists the individual). It is no more than this: to come to the limit of compearance, to that limit to which we are in effect convoked, called, and sent - and whence we are convoked, called, and sent. The call that convokes us, as well as the one we address to one another at this limit (which ... is no doubt the same call, and yet not the same) can be named, for want of a better term, writing, or literature. But above all, its essence is not to be a chose littéraire (una cosa literaria)" (Nancy, 71). The call of literature or writing (one that is not submerged in the iden- tity of a namable collectivity- America, lumpen, etc.), which L. Iluminadas question and the answers the passers-by write and unwrite with their feet could be said to demonstrate, cannot be possessed or captured as a thing. This is addressed in Lumpérica in the chapter titled "Para la formulación de una imagen en la literatura." In this chapter, the protagonist is hypothetically</page><page sequence="11">Kate Jenckes • 77 presented as dead or almost dead: she is in a hospital bed, covered with plas- tic, and "expulsando todos los sufrimientos para traspasarlos a los seres que la preceden" (8o). She is reified as a heroine or martyr, and placed in a time- less story, an image of suffering, which can be consumed in such a way that the spectators need not be "stained by her scar" ("sin mancharlos con la lacra"). Like her name, the image is a luminous one: she is suffering per- sonified, a diaphanous martyr-portrait- a brilliant prosopopeia. In a scene of torture, she is pierced with light, her interior completely revealed by an x- ray, whose light also reflects on everyone around her. She is completely knowable, a narrative possession, whether the narrative be a form of disci- plinary submission or of literary production - which, it seems to be sug- gested, are mutually implicated activities.12 The protagonist is presented as living death, contained in a frame (the frame of the image or book): entirely knowable, pure representation. Literature thus accomplished - the per- sonification of a peoples sufferings in the figure of a single person - closes itself off to history. To the past, as secrets (84) that lie out of reach of the x- ray that penetrates her interiority and projects it onto the world around her; and to the future, also a secret, but one which cannot even figuratively be attributed to an interior, one that always lies outside of every single body, every metaphor of individuality. The future of all "images in literature" - all choses littéraires - is to "forget the future like a tombstone" ("olvidando como lápida el porvenir") (80). The call of literature in Lumpérica does not reduce the possibility of community to a single wounded body, but is implicit in the wounds inflicted by writing itself: wounds that stain, unlike the wounds of the "literary image" in "Para la formulación de una imagen en la literatura"; wounds that do not let us rest in any comforting humanist aesthetic; wounds that ask us, in effect, where we are going and demand an answer, even though the only pos- sible answer is in the continued asking of the same question - at the limit, and as the limit, of a continually coming community. In a description of one of the wounds that L. Iluminada and/or Eltit literally inscribes on her arms (a photograph at the beginning of chapter 8 demonstrates a woman with cuts up and down her arms), Eltit writes, "Es solamente marca, signo o escritura que va a separar la mano que se libera mediante la línea que la</page><page sequence="12">78 • The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing antecede" (155). The writing traverses the limits of her self, the contours of her literary and photographic figuration.13 Not, as in the torture scene in "Para la formulación de una imagen en la literatura," so that an interiority can be revealed, an essence known, but as an act of freedom: an act that, as Nancy says, by tracing the limits of the individual, moves towards commu- nity. It interrupts the literary "image" (what Nancy calls the scene of myth), suspending it so that a different kind of community, one not framed in the contours of a single body, can be convoked- called for, if never repre- sented-or, if it can be represented, is represented only in its cuts, its writ- ing: a writing that interrupts all claims of prosopopeic communion. - &gt; NOTES 1. This scene does not, in fact, represent a form of turning ones back on the world, but rather of reading and writing (i.e., translating) the world in a non-idealistic fashion. On this, see Alberto Moreiras s excellent discussion of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," in Tercer espacio: Literatura y duelo en América Latina (Santiago: Universidad Arcis/LOM ediciones, 1999), chapters 4 and 5. 2. The talk was delivered as part of the Duke-UNC working group, Discourses of Knowledge and Ideological Articulations in the Americas, in February 2001. As far as I am aware, the address did not have a title. The same idea is expressed in Casullos books, however, especially Modernidad y cultura crítica (Buenos Aires: Paidós, 1998). 3. References are to Jean-Luc Nancy, The Inoperative Community, trans. Peter Connor et al. (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991).

See Beatrice Hanssens excellent discussion of these terms in Walter Benjamins Other History (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), chapter 2. 5.

[Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2001], 334). In his discussion of the material, anorganic character of language, Derrida- like Nancy- does not want to let go of the term 'oeuvre! relying more on its psychoanalytic conno- tations (i.e., as action) than its canonical ones (as product). The most important overtone in these discussions of "work" is of course that of Marx, which Nancy tries to read or "unread" through Freud (although this is only implicit). Nancy s suggestion to</page><page sequence="13">Kate Jenckes • 79 consider the Marxian notion of labor as an ongoing and indefinite (and undefining) process, as opposed to the basis of a productive humanism, as Althusser would have it, is a particularly compelling one (Nancy, 2-4 et passim). 6. Erlebnis, in Benjaminian terms. 7. Michael Sprinker, "Art and Ideology: Althusser and de Man," in Material Events. 8. De Man cites Kant's description of a "pure, material vision," in which the world is described "just as one sees it" ("seeing as poets do"- wie die Dichter es tun), without linking "experience to understanding, perception to apperception" (cited in Sprinker, 41). Similarly, in his essay "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," de Man describes a "materiality" ("of actual history") that is left when the reduction of the world to the scale of the human (the anthropomorphic) is interrupted ( The Rhetoric of Romanticism [New York: Colombia University Press, 1984], 262). 9. Idelber Avelar suggests in his recent book, The Untimely Present: Postdictatorial Latin American Fiction and the Task of Mourning (Durham: Duke University Press, 1999), that Eltit s novel represents the mournful expression of the impossibility of such an expres- sion. I would argue that Avelar s description of the decline of literature as the expres- sion of lived experience ultimately does not let go of the idea of literature as expression, but sees in literatures ruins a negative kind of expression: an expression of what could be expressed if only literature would still allow it. The title itself may be an indication of this: the present, like literature, is untimely, but the emphasis remains on the pres- ent. Untimely or not, it is still the present that concerns us, and literature must- to the extent that it can - serve the purpose of helping us situate ourselves with respect to it. In other words, it is my opinion that Avelar s conception of allegory remains funda- mentally representational (i.e., part of a humanist aesthetic), which runs counter to Benjamins discussions of the term. This is not to say that I do not greatly admire Avelar s book. 10. See Avelar, 169. Teresa Vilarós has pointed out to me that the title also lends itself to the word " empírica " (empirical), a suggestion that I find extraordinarily useful and entirely in keeping with the reading that I propose here. As far as I know, this connec- tion is unprecedented in critical writings on Eltit. 11. On the figure of the foot as a kind of writing that displaces an emphasis on the face or a knowable, personified bios, see Tom Cohen, Ideology and Inscription: "Cultural Studies ' After Benjamin, de Man, andBakhtin (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), especially part 3, in which he addresses the figure of a "zoographics ." 12. One example among many is the title of a chapter subsection: "La escritura como sen- tencia" (126). 13. Photography, like writing, can try to hide its cuts and exclusions to present an appar- ently integral reflection, or it can reveal its points of exclusion, as in the case of the chiaroscuro photograph at the beginning of chapter 8. Like cinema as well, which is a privileged trope in Eltit s book, photography involves different kinds of cuts- from the</page><page sequence="14">80 • The Work of Literature and the Unworking of Community or Writing composition of the shot, in which everything that lies outside of the shot is cut out, to the regulation of light, which determines how much of what is included in the shot will be seen and how well (especially in the case of the chiaroscuro), to the actual cutting of the film {película, which comes from the same root as skin). For an insightful dis- cussion of the relation of photography to the figure of the face, see Eduardo Cadava, Words of Light: Theses on the Photography of History (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997), 56-59. Regarding the photograph in Lumpérica, note that the cuts are on the tops of the arms, rather than on the undersides, where they would be if they were to indicate a sui- cide attempt. It is her contour that she has cut into, the contour of her human figura- tion, rather than the more ambiguous figure of "life" itself.</page></plain_text>
