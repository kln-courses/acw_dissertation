<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hume, Language and God * DEBORAH HANSEN SOLES Wichita State University I Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion is a classic in philosophy of religion and accordingly has received considerable attention. One portion of the Dialogues , however, has bewildered scholars and is often passed over in silence; I refer to the remarks made by the character Cleanthes in Part III. Part III contains two illustrations which are claimed by Cleanthes to provide obvious grounds for asserting that there is divine design present in the universe. The illustrations, one of which invokes an imaginary voice in the clouds, the other of which asks the reader to envisage a library full of living books, may appear bizarre to a modern audience. It is not at all clear that these fantasies illuminate any interesting or striking similarities between products of human intelligence and works of nature from which the inference to a designer could be drawn; nor is it clear what other bearing these examples, portraying imaginary states of affairs, could have on the design argument. Those few commentators who have addressed these passages directly have been unable to generate an interpretation which consistently explains both of the illustrations and which permits Part III to fit comfortably with the remainder of the Dialogues. To wit, they have suggested that the illustrations appeal to different sense of 'design' (Norman Kemp Smith and George Nathan)1, or that one of the illustrations, but apparently not the other, is an attempt to introduce a new species of inference into the design argument (Nelson Pike)2, or they have completely ignored the occurrence or content of one or the other of the illustrations (Nelson Pike, Stanley Tweyman and P. S. Wadia).3 In this paper I want to suggest that the core of the discussion in Part III is the nature and explanation of verbal communication, and *An earlier version of this paper called '' 'Language and God: Part III of Hume's Dialogues" was read at the Pacific Division Meetings of the American Philosophical Association, March 23-25, 1979. 1 am especially indebted to Robert C. Cummins for several helpful suggestions and to the editors of this journal. 109</page><page sequence="2">that these odd illustrations represent issues which intrigued the eighteenth century: the way we explain particular cases of language use and the ability to use language. The two illustrations really are, as Cleanthes claims, different but related ways of making the same point: they are both used by Cleanthes to argue that the greatest support for the existence of an intelligent cause is to be found in the nature of language. I argue that Cleanthes' strategy in Part III is to offer a pair of inferences which he believes will command assent; once agreement is obtained on these, he can and does argue that more traditional formulations of the design argument are analogous in important respects to these two illustrations, and should likewise command assent. While Cleanthes' arguments are unsuccessful, as I show, they are interesting. In the larger context of the Dialogues as a whole, we see that Part III is concerned not only with the question of whether or not there are sufficient similarities between works of nature and human productions to warrant the inference to a causally efficacious intelligent creator, although it begins with this issue; it also deals with the questions of whether or not our experience, especially our experience of language use, can be explained satisfactorily by appeal to natural, as opposed to supernatural, sources of order. Thus Part III continues the discussion begun in Part II with Cleanthes' introduction of the design argument and Philo' s criticisms of it based on the inexactness of the analogy between works of artifice and works of nature, as well as anticipating much of the later discussion of the Dialogues, in which a number of non-mental principles of order, mentioned but not developed in Part II, are considered as potentially acceptable sources of explanation. It is important to realize that contemporaries of Hume may not have found the illustrations in Part III to be especially puzzling. Within theological circles, there had been a long tradition of appealing to the human capacity to use language as evidence for the existence of a divine creator. Also, the richness, creativity, coherence and relevance of human speech had been much commented upon and studied by the Cartesians and Port-Royal grammarians. Chomsky credits Descartes and a number of his contemporaries with both emphasizing these features of natural languages, and with arguing for the "impossibility of a mechanistic explanation for the creative aspect of normal use of language"4 and from this to the conclusion that there must be a "creative" principle - mind - which is responsible for speech. Descartes, for 110</page><page sequence="3">one, went so far as to claim that "the word is the sole sign and the only certain mark of the presence of thought hidden and wrapped up in the body".5 Given, furthermore, the availability of the distinction, originally promulgated by the Port-Royal grammarians and adopted by continental philosophers, between "particular grammar" and its underlying "universal grammar," that is, between the rules of a particular language on the one hand, and the unchanging and general principles of language underlying the conventions and uses of particular languages6 on the other, it is reasonable to believe that Hume assumed that his audience would have no particular difficulty with understanding the significance of either the voice in the clouds or the living library. While I do not mean to suggest that Cleanthes represents Cartesian positions or espouses any hypothesis about innateness, (he doesn't), he is addressing problems that intrigued the Cartesians. The voice in the clouds illustration concentrates on the explanation of a particular practical application of language (which presupposes the "universal grammar"); the living library directs one's attention to the explanation of the existence and nature of that universal grammar. In post-Chomskian terminology, we can describe Cleanthes' remarks about the voice in the clouds as exemplifying the received explanation of linguistic performance; his use of the living library is to offer an explanation of linguistic competence by attributing the existence and nature of the underlying structures of language, of linguistic ability, to the intentions of a divine mind. II The first illustration in Part III enjoins the reader to imagine a great and powerful voice speaking from the heavens, simultaneously reaching each community in its own language, and delivering a benevolent message. In such a case, Cleanthes intimates, one would admit that one's available evidence of past voices and their intelligent sources does warrant the inference to an intelligent source for this voice. Even though one's experience does not contain occurrences of precisely this sort, and in spite of the fact that the voice in the clouds differs from experienced human voices by the uniqueness of its occurrence and "its loudness, extent and flexibility to all languages,"7 still, one would be inclined to infer a cause for it similar to the causes of experienced human voices. The explicitly stated motivation for this illustration is to show that objections to the design argument based on the dissimilarities between works of artifice and works of nature, which Philo offers in 111</page><page sequence="4">Part II, are mere cavils which should not be dignified by philosophical counter-argument. The voice in the clouds is supposed to provide a clear case of legitimate causal imputation in the face of dissimilarity of some effects. Since one purportedly can tolerate some differences of the effects in this instance of causal reasoning, the differences between works of artifice and works of nature to which the skeptical Philo points should be tolerated as well. While the analogy between works of human beings and works of nature may not be exact, the differences between them are suggested to be unimportant and irrelevant. Berkeley provides a superficially similar sort of case in his Alciphron, commenting that "a common man, who is not used to think and make reflexions, would probably be more convinced of the being of a God by one sentence heard in his life from the sky"8 than by continuous experience of the more subtle Visual Language of Nature. Berkeley's point is that the voice in the clouds would be more obvious evidence of God's existence, but that it does not differ materially from what he conceives to be God's way of literally speaking directly to the senses. While Cleanthes nowhere claims that we are immersed in or bombarded by this Berkeleian Natural Language, he does seem to be taking a leaf from Berkeley's book when he adopts this putatively persuasive device. But the point that Cleanthes is intent on making is that if we are willing to assent to the imputation of an intelligent cause for the voice in the clouds, we also ought to be willing to assent to an intelligent cause for other phenomena, in spite of certain differences in effects.9 Cleanthes reaches this extremely questionable conclusion by trading on the fact that if there were to occur such a great voice, and one were to make such a causal imputation, the grounds for such an inference would be certain important similarities between the voice and other voices encountered in the past: namely, the wisdom, rationality, coherence and relevance of the speech. It is these features which would suggest a rational cause or rational speaker, and it is these features of the occurrence which would not be explained by appeal to the naturalistic hypothesis of mere whistling of the wind in the trees. Even with Hume's rather stringent conditions on imputations of causal efficacy, this voice in the clouds would receive explanation by appeal to a rational cause; although Hume might quail at the attribution of divinity to this cause which Cleanthes so blithely makes. The differences to which Cleanthes points between the voice in the clouds and experienced human voices, whose occurrences have always been accompanied by the presence of intelligent human beings, are by and large irrelevant 112</page><page sequence="5">differences. Tone of voice, apparent location, details of content, benevolence or lack of thereof in the message, or multi-linguality are not relevant factors in determining the cause of a voice. But the differences to which the skeptical Philo points in Part II are not even putatively irrelevant. The fact that even peculiar cases of communication typically receive explanation by appeal to a rational agent does not imply anything at all about the sort of explanation appropriate to other sorts of phenomena. While Philo does not directly tackle this example, many of the alternative explanatory hypotheses he offers in later portions of the Dialogues are addressed to precisely this issue. Depending on the features of the universe one selects, that is, depending on the phenomena one wants to explain, vegetative or generational or mechanistic principles may provide the preferred explantion. Ill Having, he thinks, defeated those objections to the design argument based on dissimilarity of effects, and having demonstrated one facet of the intimate connection between language and mind, Cleanthes proceeds to outline his next illustration. But in spite of the disclaimer with which the second illustration is initiated, that the case of the living library is "still nearer the present one of the universe" (153) than the voice in the clouds, the living library is baffling to a modern audience. The reader is asked to assume that there is a universal human language spoken by all people, and that books are natural productions "which perpetuate themselves in the same manner with animals and vegetables, by descent and propagation" (153). These assumptions are supposed to be facilitated by recognition of the fact that existing animals have a language of sorts. Each of the books "reasons and discourses; . . . expostulates, argues, and enforces its views and topics . . . applie[s] sometimes to the pure intellect, sometimes to the affections; ... it collects, disposes, and adorns every consideration suited to the subject ..." (153). Cleanthes argues that the wisdom and rationality, expressiveness and eloquence of these living books - in short, the richness, creativity, coherence and relevance of normal speech to which I alluded earlier - would force one to conclude that the ultimate cause of such entities must be found in thought and design, on pain of having to conclude that they "had really no meaning" (153). In addition, Cleanthes argues, one must also conclude that the ultimate cause of actual entities must be found in thought and design. "Choose, 113</page><page sequence="6">then, your party, Philo, without ambiguity or evasion" he challenges, "Assert either that a rational volume is no proof of a rational cause, or admit of a similar cause to all the works of nature" (154). Let us unpack this, keeping in mind that it is books, and not just any group of propagating artifacts, upon which Cleanthes' thesis depends. Cleanthes is arguing that since living books are less complex things than natural organisms and since natural or biological principles alone cannot explain these books, natural or biological principles alone cannot explain the greater complexity of actual organisms. This argument makes two crucial assumptions: first, that if natural or biological principles cannot explain the complexity of living books, then they cannot explain the complexity of anything living, (or at least the complexity of relatively complex living things), and second, that the complexity of the living books is of the same kind as that of naturally occurring organisms. If the complexity in question differs in kind, and not merely in degree, then the failure of available naturalistic principles of order to explain imaginary objects would be totally irrelevant. What would be relevant is whether existing naturalistic principles can explain the complexity of natural organisms which do exist. While Cleanthes does not offer any extended argument for either of these assumptions, it is clear that he is assenting to them. Furthermore, it is clear that he has a particular sort of complexity in mind when he reasons that biological principles alone cannot account for the complexity of living books. The crucial sort of complexity which biological or natural principles of order cannot explain is found in the language using abilities of the books.10 The biological principles of descent and propagation alone are thought to be incapable of explaining the language use of the books, yielding only an unending regress of parenting relations. The language use of the books, that is, their capacity to use language, is held to require appeal to an original intelligent source for its explanation; "could you persist in asserting . . . that the first formation of this volume in the loins of its original parent proceeds not from thought and design?" asks Cleanthes rhetorically (153). Since books, even living books, are held to be less complex than natural organisms - he says "there are infinitely fewer parts and less contrivance in the finest composition of eloquence than in the coarsest organized body" (153) - Cleanthes believes that any satisfactory explanation of the nature of existing organisms which have a language will have to appeal to a similar intelligent source to explain that capacity to use 114</page><page sequence="7">language, to explain the existence and nature of the "universal grammar." By supposing that there is a universal human language, as Cleanthes does, the complications provided by the multiplicity of actual spoken languages are ignored. The actual situation of Babel is seen as so much more grist for the theisťs mill: additional complexity (in the form of a variety of languages) more insistently demands an intelligent causally efficacious creator. And by supposing that animals have a language of sorts, Cleanthes manages to suggest that this form of complexity too must have its original cause in an external intelligence. So far, Cleanthes has argued that not only does an instance of rational speech require a rational cause, but also that the capacity for rational speech requires a rational cause. His point is that even if one does not initially recognize the order and organization in the physical world as evidence of design, surely the ability of living books, and by extension animals and humans, to communicate is evidence which must command assent to the design hypothesis. Hume has Cleanthes drawing an implicit analogy in Part III between the curious living books and language using animals, particularly human beings. Presumably, if one is willing to grant that the existence of such a living library would be grounds for asserting that there is an intelligent source of order in the universe, one would also be willing to grant that the actual existence of more complex language using entities is also grounds for that assertion. If Cleanthes persuades his audience with this argument, then all he needs to do is to tie the imaginary cases more closely to the actual universe in order to show that more standard forms of the design argument are legitimate. And this is exactly what he does when he claims that naturalistic principles alone are not only inadequate to explain the ability to communicate,11 but that they are also inadequate to explain many other features of organisms, specifically, the "curious adjustment of final causes" (154) found in nature such as the marvelous intricacies of the eye and the process of propagation of species. Natural or biological principles can only explain the propagation of organisms possessing such features as being offspring of other organisms with those features; these principles cannot explain why any of the organisms possess precisely these features. The addition of the design hypothesis is thought to provide the explanatory power needed to answer this last question. Cleanthes believes that the order and organization of the biological universe is as surely evidence for design as is language: both display the same sort of adjustment of means to ends. 115</page><page sequence="8">While Cleanthes' position may be untenable, it is not entirely unintelligible. On the interpretation that I have offered, Cleanthes' mistakes are attributable to something other than his own intellectual clumsiness;12 they rest on the view that both the actual use of language and the underlying ability to use language are to receive similar sorts of explanation. This expectation is facilitated by Cleanthes' "proportional cause" assumption, that the cause must be proportional to the effect. If mind must be posited in order to account for cases of linguistic performance, how much greater a mind must be posited to account for the existence and nature of linguistic competence, for the ability to perform. Viewed from a certain perspective, communication may appear mysterious: how is it that when I have an idea and express it with certain noises, you can understand my noises and come to have an idea similar to mine? This is really two questions: one about particular performances, one about the ability to perform. Presumably, Cleanthes would be quite unhappy with Hume's own account of linguistic communication13 which explains at most performance, that is, how particular ideas and particular sounds are connected (by "habit"), but does not pretend to explain one's capacity to form such habits. The answer from Port-Royal was that there is a universal structure underlying our performances which allows us to learn the conventions and uses of our particular native tongue. We can see Cleanthes demands a further explanation for the existence of that universal grammar. Cleanthes' view that language use in general, the capacity to use language, requires a supernatural explanation is faulty, but it is interesting, for it involves precisely the same sort of assumption involved in claiming that the complexity of the eye remains unexplained when natural principles of order have been exhausted. It is the assumption that a further, teleological explanation of the nature of things can be given; the design hypothesis is supposed to give it.14 Whatever persuasive character the argument from design possesses lies in the fact that it is thought to have far greater explanatory power than any competing hypothesis, for it alone is seen to answer the final demand for explanation. This is the point of Cleanthes' remark that "if the argument for theism be, as you pretend, contradictory to the principles of logic; its universal, its irresistible influence proves clearly that there may be arguments of a like irregular nature" (155). Philo, speaking for Hume, does not of course accept this line of reasoning. Without directly attacking the difficulties surrounding the explanation of linguistic competence, he reiterates the prima 116</page><page sequence="9">facie adequacy of natural principles in explaining complex entities found in nature.15 Just as Hume avoids the question of the original causes of human capacities, Philo refuses to become embroiled in the particular question of the causes of linguistic competence. I think Philo would say that if one desires an explanation for linguistic competence, the best one can do is to appeal to various ways in which, and principles according to which, the human understanding operates. Furthermore, he would be inclined to add that if one must have a teleological explanation, a need he doesn't share, why not make nature itself teleological? This, at least, would avoid all difficulties and dangers of anthropomorphizing the deity discussed in Part IV of the Dialogues. IV The debates in the Dialogues are Hume's explorations of the question of whether or not the design hypothesis is a good explanation, as well as whether or not it is a hypothesis supported by the available evidence. Does the imputation of a divine intelligent cause provide the best explanation of the phenomena? The skeptical challenge is not merely to available evidence, but also to the explanatory power of the hypothesis. Other things being equal, that is, the available evidence being moot, can we attribute benefits to the design hypothesis not shared by naturalistic explanatory hypotheses either singly or as a group? It would seem that Philo' s answer is a provisional no; not even the human predicament is better explained by appeal to the existence of a causally efficacious intelligent divinity.16 The one apparent counter-example to this negative response might be thought to be found in the Part III illustrations. But if my interpretation is correct, the multiplicity of alternative explanations offered by Philo in the later pages of the Dialogues provides the desired response. For Philo is there attempting to spell out in some detail both the best explanation for various sorts of phenomena and to elaborate on some of the characteristics any good explanation must have. If one judges explanations as the skeptic does, on a set of standards that rule out as unacceptable many arguments which people accept as good explanations, Cleanthes' suggestion is that perhaps one is construing the concept of a good explanation too narrowly. Skeptical Philo's response to this is that the theistic addition to naturalistic explanation is vacuous at best, and may involve one in inconsistency, or blasphemy in the form of anthropomorphism, at worst. 117</page><page sequence="10">NOTES 1.

Mary Whiton Calkins, (New York: Scribner's, 1957), p. 374. 9. It is possible that Hume borrowed this example from Berkeley; but the interpretation that Pike, op. cit., places on it is far too Berkeleian. Pike argues that Cleanthes, hence Hume, is introducing a new form of inference, unmediated by and independent of past experience, with the voice in the clouds, and that Philo (hence Hume) ultimately capitulates to this form of inference. Aside from the fact that this interpretation of the voice in the clouds offers no way of handling the living library, it would also have us read Cleanthes as suddenly throwing out the ground rules for causal reasoning he had just agreed to in Part II, without Philo responding to this monstrous shift in the assumptions of the debate until Part XII when he is supposed to capitulate. 10. Interestingly, Tweyman, op. cit., has provided an independent representation of the structure of the argument embedded in the living library similar to that which I am advocating, although he does not locate the point of the argument at all where I do. Tweyman completely ignores the role of language in the living library, and hence feels no need to discuss the voice in the clouds. 1 1 . Thus in Part III Cleanthes wants assent to the teleological explanation for actual phenomena, not just possible phenomena. Wadia (op. cit.) has offered the intriguing hypothesis that the thrust of Part III is to allow Cleanthes to successfully rebut the extreme skeptical thesis that there could not be, in our world, any evidence which would force one to posit a divine intelligence; hence Cleanthes' emphasis on imagined examples. I am not persuaded that the illustrations represent this victory for Cleanthes, and I think it is clear that the illustrations in Part III are designed to serve a broader purpose than this. 118</page><page sequence="11">12. It should be clear that Cleanthes is not embroiling himself in an equivocation of 'design' between 'order externally imposed by a rational agent' and 'self-organization', contra Norman Kemp Smith, op. cit., and George Nathan, op. cit. Nor, contra Nathan, are the illustrations in Part III "curiously inconsistent" with the remainder of the Dialogues. While some teleological arguments may trade on an ambiguous use of 'design', those in Part III do not, and as I have argued, the Part III illustrations, while unusual, aren't inconsistent with other versions in the Dialogues. On the contrary, the core of the debates in the Dialogues reflects an argument about the sorts of explanations that can be given for various types of phenomena; Part III illustrates the way a teleological argument is supposed to explain the use of language. 13. David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature , Bk. I, pt. I, sec. VII and Bk. III, pt. II, sec. II. 14. Cleanthes thus reflects a venerable tradition: teleological arguments typically rest on the assumption that the best and most complete explanation of any occurrence whatsoever ultimately requires appeal to a rational cause. See for example, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica, Part I, Question II, Article III, especially Reply to Second Objection, where this claim is explicitly made. 15. See for example Part VII of the Dialogues , p. 179, where it is said that propagation will bestow a particular order and organization on organisms. 16. Philo s Part XII concessions to Cleanthes are more apparent than real. There, Philo grants that some sort of teleological response is a common one to demands for final explanation, but he does not grant that the theistic position is a necessary response or that the available evidence warrants the standard theological version. On the contrary, Philo suggests that opposing claims about the characteristics of whatever it is that first originated order are "verbal" disputes. I take this to mean that the addition of divine intelligence as an explanatory device is empirically vacuous though perhaps emotionally comforting. 119</page></plain_text>
