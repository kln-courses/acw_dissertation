<plain_text><page sequence="1">IN THE WORLD: AN ART ESSAY AN INTRODUCTION by Josephine Withers Earthworks have been with us for many thousands of years in far-flung parts of the globe. Their power and mystery have always been acknowledged, if not understood. In the 1960s, earthworks were reinvented here in America by artists seeking an escape from the urban art world images and rituals. Men such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, and Robert Morris dominated the first generation of earthworkers, and there was about them a macho spirit, reclaiming for civilization (and art) abandoned, burned-out, or wasteland regions of the outback (New Jersey slagheaps and Montana buttes). The American frontier spirit was coupled with liberal concepts about the ecology, as many of these projects, like Smithson's Spiral Jetty or Heizer's Double Negative were used as laboratories to demonstrate interactions between man-made ar- tifacts and natural processes. The emphasis, however, was on the differences between the products and processes of man and nature. Since the emergence of that first generation of heroes, the field has been given over to many more artists, and the symbolic and contextual meanings of earthworks created in the seventies have become diversified and layered. It is no accident that this coin- cides with yet another wave of interest in the prehistoric earth- works. During this same decade, many probing and imaginative studies were published on these early earthsites, postulating new theories about how they came to be, and to what purpose. Even though they were not represented at all in the exhibitions or surveys of the sixties, women artists made a token appearance in the seventies; then, by 1975, one could not legitimately survey this field without including the work of Nancy Holt, Michelle Stuart, Patricia Johanson, Bonnie Sherk et al., Helen and Newton Harrison, Ana Mendieta, Mary Miss, Alice Aycock, Athena Tacha, Elyn Zimmerman, and others.

But their influence has been such that they have, as a group, redirected the initial mainstream, away from the emphatically ar- tificial construct and towards a more cooperative, organic, and process-oriented modeling. As the aesthetic effect became more integrated, even "invisible," the artwork became in and of the world, rather than a description of our experience about the world, as is the case with the separate and parallel reality of paint- ing. Several models can be identified, but the work of any one artist will normally combine more than one. Earthworks that point to, frame, or organize our perceptions of a natural process, event, or landscape feature are the most ancient, and today among the most persistent. They exist not only as works to be looked at, but also as pointers or indicators of phenomena and relationships on the earth and in the heavens. Reclamation has been a byword of the urban and wilderness ecological movements of the past decade, and it is a significant component of contemporary earth- works. Many of these same earthworks use organic, inorganic, or social ecosystems; others create aesthetic and/or ecological systems that seek to join together in paradigmatic fashion the macrocosmic and microcosmic scales. Works that image the earth as matter, as a living body, source, incubator, or repository usual- ly are in sharp contrast to the more objective use of the landscape as framed picture. The former normally rises up and recedes back into the undifferentiated material continuum, the latter seeks to isolate or separate out a chosen motif. Earthworks have evolved in the context of a broad-based aesthetic which declares that "art is all over." "Dematerialization," "Fluxus," "Process," "Off the wall," are a handful of phrases marking various manifestations of this larger phenomenon. Earth artists have clearly chosen an ambitiously large arena and heroic context and/or content in which to play out the next stage in the development of worldly art. 326</page><page sequence="3">In the World: An Art Essay Michelle Stuart, Niagara Gorge Path Relocated, rocks, earth, muslin-backed paper, 420' x 62", Artpark, Lewiston, New York, 1975. "This scroll traced the actual location of Niagara Falls some 12,000 years ago, thereby serving as a life-size map diagramming a prior event. In contrast to Smithson, Heizer, et al., who can be described as scouts or adventurers in the wilderness, Stuart regards nature as a part or extension of her own universe. Niagara Gorge is one of her geomythologies, in which an anthropomorphic deity, such as Gaea, is replaced by the substance (rocks, earth) and the geological event (faults, waterfalls) which she symbolizes."

Lin's memorial, selected from a field of 1,421 submissions in a national com- petition, is intended to heal the psychic and political wounds of the Vietnam War. The black marble slabs, with the names of all dead and missing listed chronologically in order of death or disappearance, are conceived as a black slit or gash which disappears into the earth at each end. It is sited on the Washington, D.C., Mall, between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. Despite vociferous controversy during the approval and construc- tion phases, the monument is clearly a success; the number of visitors has ex- ceeded expectations. Many visitors become actively engaged in the symbolism of the memorial as they discover the name of their neighbor, buddy, or loved one. For many, the memorial evokes the sadness of the loss of life, but also the spirit of courage and comradeship of those who fought. 328</page><page sequence="5">In the World: An Art Essay 329 " ^ Z^^ r -s0-s' -x W;^ -- , '?r.i - .·' , -.o .-.. .. ... ,!s. jT i.. .. . . - . .-,, -.. .. _., ~-~~~·· ~' -' "~" ....

The Sun Tunnels, cast in concrete, are a permanent installation on desert property in western Utah, owned by the artist. The tunnels organize our perceptions of the otherwise fairly monotonous and undifferentiated desert landscape. The East-West tunnels align with the rising sun of the summer and winter solstices. Holes drilled into the walls of the tunnels allows the midday sun to fall in patterns mimicking the constellations of Capricorn, Draco, Perseus, and Columba. 330</page><page sequence="7">In the World: An Art Essay Helen and Newton Harrison, Baltimore Promenade, 1981 (ongoing); proposal for the City of Baltimore, Maryland. Helen and Newton Harrison work collaboratively on projects that elucidate, and complement existing ecological systems, or reclaim pre-existing systems, both natural and urban. The Baltimore Promenade is a proposal that seeks to link up in a continuous three-mile processional, a series of neighborhoods that are presently truncated or otherwise separated because of visual or physical barriers. The two axes of the proposed promenade run from The Mont Royal Center south to the Inner Harbor and from that point east to Patterson Park. The proposal is premised on the idea that a healthy living city is a continuous network of human connections, the pedestrian, the woman/man walking through town, connecting and interacting with other pedestrians, is the paradigmatic model the Harrisons seek to develop in the Baltimore project. The proposal involves removing barriers where they exist, opening up "lines of sight," and providing positive inducements for pedestrians to move along the promenade. The result will be a renewed sense of connectedness as neighborhoods flow into each other rather than turning their backs. 331</page><page sequence="8">In the World: An Art Essay ) / / V 332 ** - I I -1- e 4 Z ^ -`Sr \. , », ( , -l ) \ / i \1 "I \, \ I ,. t\ ''"\</page><page sequence="9">In the World: An Art Essay 1 " '.- , 'A 4 ,,,*. . * .- * -t .IrcW' a 0 ,; Patricia Johanson, Saggitaria Platyphylla-Planting Plan (Paths through Water, Plants, Fish, and Animals), Fair Park Lagoon, 1982; proposal for the Dallas Museum of Natural History. "When Patricia Johanson was asked to prepare an artistic scheme for the Fair Park Lagoon area, she began to investigate the physical properties of the lagoon: its flora and fauna, and what might be possible to achieve ecologically and artistically within a Texas urban park setting. Working closely with profes- sionals from the Natural History Museum, Johanson has created an outdoor sculpture that will restore a functional aquatic and biological community to the lagoon as well as aesthetically enliven the physical space. Using the patterns of native Texas vegetation, she has created a series of paths, bridges, crossovers and overlooks that encourage the visitor to interact with the ecology of the lagoon. This ecological yet aesthetic and functional landscape will extend the space of the Museum out-of-doors, providing a living natural history exibit as well as contemporary sculpture garden."

The Farm is the most ambitious urban or wilderness ecological art project to date. It is improbably perched on five and a half acres that encompass a tangled freeway system, four different ethnic neighborhoods, and three water springs. "The Farm serves multiple functions. It is a resource center for the study of land use and food as well as an art center. Sherk sees it as a work of perfor- mance art in its entirety. There are demonstration projects on responsible agriculture, children's art and dance classes, activities for psychiatric patients and senior citizens, pottery and printmaking workshops, a solar greenhouse and a Savonius windmill, flower, vegetable and herb gardens, crops and animals. Because the Farm is also an environmental and social artwork, it has unexpected twists, such as the way it nonchalantly incorporates the incredible technical monolith called the 'Freeway,' like a garden beside a cathedral."
