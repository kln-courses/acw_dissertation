These are the common ques- tions of rock-art research but the answers are nearly always elu- sive. It is very tempting to impose age or meaning, to be deceived by dating technology or to be blinded by the persuasiveness of cer- tain forms of interpretation when studying rock pictures; too often we fail to question the validity of our answers or to distinguish 'ernie', 'etic' and different levels of interpretation. At the same time, rock-art research will always be a human science, subject to interpretation, analogy and personal perspectives. But this does not mean that we cannot bring a high level of scholarship to the discipline, as Andrée Rosenfeld has shown in her capacity as a researcher and teacher. She has developed ways of treating rock- art as data, giving us insight into diverse aspects of the past, as well as better answering the questions of age and meaning associ- ated with unique forms of rock-art imagery. In 1976, while researching an essay for a first year Fine Arts course, I chanced upon a small but robust 1967 pub- lication called Palaeolithic cave art, by PJ. Ucko and A. Rosenfeld. From the beginning, the authors enthralled me with the introductory hook of 'In the following pages the intention is to show that the reasons why Stone Age hunters went to considerable lengths to decorate rock shelters and caves is in itself a fascinating problem' (1967:7). Little did I know just how much this statement and one of these authors would influence me in years to come or that ascertaining the reasons could be so prob- lematic! In rock-art research, as with all archaeology, we com- monly ask of our material how old is it?; and what does it mean? In North America and Australia we are fortu- nate because in each continent there were recently, and in some cases still are, clear living descendants of rock painters and engravers to help us answer these ques- tions. Thus, occasionally, we can use informed methods 'that depend on some source of insight passed on directly or indirectly from those who made and used the rock-art - through ethnography, through ethnohistory, through the historical record, or through modern under- standing known with good cause to perpetuate ancient knowledge' (Taçon and Chippindale 1998:6). More commonly, however, we must rely on formal methods as we have no basis for informed knowledge and must approach the subject 'cold'. The information comes only from the images themselves, their relationships to each other, landscape and archaeological contexts. Often, because of their fragmentary nature and deterioration over time, we are only able to discern a small amount of an image or art system that must once have played a prominent role in some society. Occasionally, analogy and secure dating aid in our reading of rock-art but even these need to be approached cautiously, ideally com- bined with insight derived from formal and/or informed methods of analysis (eg. Clottes 1998; Chippindale and Taçon 1998b). Rock-art researchers in North America have long been concerned with the question of meaning while Australians have more closely addressed the question of age, with few scientific attempts to bring both questions together in a comprehensive but critical fashion, as the Ucko and Rosenfeld book said was important to do. One of the reasons is the newness and uncertainty of many rock-art dating techniques but as Rosenfeld warned in 1982 'Although much effort has been expended on dis- covering the meaning of European prehistoric art, most prehistorians in Australia consider the interpretation of the meaning of rock art too fraught with uncertainties to pursue' (1982:199; see also Smith 1997). But this does not mean that we will never be able to make some sense of ancient pictures. For instance, Rosenfeld, in many of her publications, has actively pursued certain forms of meaning. However, she has not done this in an ad hoc or subjective way. Instead, her approach is to first gain a thorough understanding of the nature of a rock-art's structure, form, subject matter and 'style', to explore the best use of ethnography or analogy, to see how chronol- ogy and dating can assist with understanding and finally to tease out different levels of meaning from the data. It is only in this way that we can begin to more critically examine and more fully understand ancient imagery with any form of confidence. 1 . Rock-art is hyphenated in this paper following a convention used in The archaeology of rock-art (Chippindale and Taçon 1998) in an attempt to make the term a portmanteau, a word that is a combination of two other words in form and meaning. This hopefully avoids unnecessary debates about the meaning of 'art' and/or 'rock art', calls for name changes and searches for a better term.

She argues that by describing style, motif and subject matter, in essence the structure of an art body, one could better delineate change and perhaps throw some light on aspects of meaning. In the introduction to a paper titled Style and meaning in Laura art: a case study in the formal analy- sis of style in prehistoric art she emphasised this point: As with other archaeological material, a formal definition of the data, in this case the motif range in a corpus of pre- historic art, must be a prerequisite to any more ambitious semiological analysis. Recent and current ethnographic examples may then serve as models for the range of likely practices. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how even a relatively simple formal analysis of visual images in a body of prehistoric rock art may reveal aspects of the operational mode of an artistic system (1982:200). Rosenfeld's argument that rock-art motifs could be used as data and that the data has structure which can shed light on aspects of meaning is illustrated by Jo McDonald's (1994, 1998) study of Sydney Basin rock- art and my study of Arnhem Land rock paintings (Taçon 1989a, 1989b), both of which she supervised. My first task in the field was to get a feeling for the data base by sorting motifs according to style, subject matter, tech- nique and so forth. It soon became evident that the art body of even a single one of the several Arnhem Land periods was complex; the more recent rock art, of the last 3000-4000 years and often labelled 'X-ray', was both convoluted and extremely varied. But, with work, both temporal and chronological sub-styles could be defined and relationships between forms, techniques, functions, types, colours, subjects, themes and sizes would be eluci- dated (see Taçon 1989b:141; Taçon 1992b:205). Furthermore, it seemed possible to link this art variation and complexity to the archaeology in the ground, per- haps leading to a better understanding of the past in the process (Taçon 1991; Taçon and Brockwell 1995). Rosenfeld argued this was not only an important objec- tive for understanding the rock-art of western Arnhem Land but also for our comprehension of Australian rock art in general: A number of pan-continental traits for Aboriginal art can be isolated, in technique, motif and general stylistic con- ventions. It permits a definition of the principal and recur- ring traits of Aboriginal rock art. Such a classification was at the core of Maynard's threefold schema for Aboriginal rock art. These classes, however, have proved to be too general for analytical purposes, since they con- form neither to chronology nor very closely to regional- ism or archaeological criteria. I doubt that further refine- ments of such a pan-continental schema are still useful at the present stage of Aboriginal rock art research. They must necessarily gloss the very aspects which might enable us to trace the processes of change in art either through time or across a cultural landscape. Regional developmental sequences are demonstrably non-uniform across the continent and may be very complex as is becoming clear in western Arnhem Land. To examine questions of diffusion - or more precisely of the role of art in group contact situations - the more narrowly focused regional studies, integrating art and archaeology such as are now being undertaken by a number of researchers are needed (Rosenfeld 1988:35). Although Rosenfeld's approach to analysing rock-art has always essentially been an archaeological one, she also advocates the judicious use of ethnography. In her 1982 paper she reviewed how ethnographically-derived information can appropriately be used to shed light on meaning, noting: 'It is clear, therefore, that the correct identification of the imagery of much recent Aboriginal art relies on making reference to other cultural knowl- edge' (1982:202). After reviewing problems with the ill- considered use of ethnographic data, she elaborated fur- ther by concluding that 'we may infer from a synthesis of recent and present day Aboriginal art systems that recognition of visual images is achieved by a combina- tion of the visual information encoded in the image itself with extraneous information which may be derived from associated visual symbols, from contextual data, or from the identity of the painter' (1982:203). In a 1986 review of Australian Aboriginal rock-art she went further: 'many archaeologists are developing ethnographic skills and by adding Aboriginal insights to the results of our archaeological analyses the study of this largely prehis- toric body of art can be greatly enriched' (1986:53). Using ethnography in conjunction with archaeological information, method and theory can be quite insightful, all the more so if combined with theory or analogies from art history, psychology, environmental studies and other fields to make a broad multi-disciplinary approach to the subject matter (Taçon 1987:42-43). However, Rosenfeld insists on rigour when using any approach, while at the same time advocating the generation of analogies from varied sources: In summary, the more varied and the more numerous the analogies that can be adduced, the more likely one is to find a convincing interpretation for an archaeological fact. The more numerous and the more detailed the paral- lels, the more likely one is to be able to assess the likeli- hood of a particular parallel being a significant one, and the greater the possibility of checking against the content and context of the archaeological material (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967:157). Rosenfeld's cautious approach, and warnings not to project contemporary Aboriginal views too far back into the past without good reason, highlights the point that the reliability and applicability of specific ethnographic details need to be cross-referenced via a consideration of varied sources of ethnographic data (eg. Cole 1997; Flood 1997:21-22; Taçon 1992a). This is because 'iconographie meanings seem to be variable and histori- cally idiosyncratic - rather than standardised and acces- sible by some generalising rules in an anthropology of art' (Taçon and Chippindale 1998:7). For example, let's say we locate a wonderful depiction of a quadruped in 96</page><page sequence="3">obverse perspective with a fifth appendage between two others; all appendages are extended and the figure has a flattened appearance. To us it resembles a road kill, the final remains of some unfortunate animal. The depiction is found to be thousands of years old so not only is this not something run over by a road train but also there is no one with informed knowledge to consult. How do we better figure out what it might be? An examination of faunal records and recent Indigenous art, that has informed knowledge associated with it, reveals the creature to likely be a goanna as seen from above. However, we find that among neighbouring groups of people to the one mostly closely associated with the ancient picture it is thought to be a human male seen from the front. But a deeper analysis of both cul- tures suggests a third possibility, that it is the male Goanna-ancestor that was depicted in his ambiguous transformative form, half-way between human and ani- mal. This is similar to what Flood (1987) found in Cape York with echidna-like depictions but she did not have to project the interpretation too far back in time and had lots of other data to support it. In other words, she was able to cross-reference her interpretation with results from various independent lines of analysis. With our example we would be cautious until supporting data, in the form of other pictures, associations and analogies, were in hand. We would then assess more reliably what the flattened-looking creature might be, which of the three possibilities was most likely and whether all three could be correct in different contexts. In a thought-pro- voking study, this is exactly what Smith (1998) did when confronted with an unusual turtle image, leading him to reject his first interpretation that the turtle was an echidna. Dating and chronology It is important not to confuse dating with chronology. Chronology refers to the ordering of different forms and/or styles of rock-art, from oldest to youngest based on formal qualities of difference, the nature of superim- positioning at sites and across regions, as well as the nature of differential weathering and so forth. Chronologies may or may not have dates associated with them. The temporal separation between chronological layers is irregular, often with little indication of the order of magnitude. One style might be separated from another by hundreds of years, the next by thousands. Chronologies are systems that order marking events into relative sequences. This is usually done through on site observation; a particularly useful method at complex sites employs Harris matrices (Harris 1989; for an exam- ple at two Arnhem Land sites see Chippindale and Taçon 1993). Dating gives us numbers to attach to chronological layers. These numbers may or may not be closely associ- ated with marking events; often they are only minimum or maximum ages; sometimes they make reference to a small part of the gap between layers. As Rosenfeld (1993:71) has often pointed out, 'Dating rock art and related rock markings is notoriously difficult and the issue of the antiquity of rock art in Australia has become a very contentious subject'. It was not until the late 1980s that the direct dating of rock-art became practical, with Alan Watchman (eg. 1987, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993a, 1993b) leading the way in Australia for radiocar- bon techniques. But as Rosenfeld explains: More than anything else, the problem of securely dating rock-art has been a major impediment to its acceptance as useful archaeological data. While the advent of radiocar- bon methods constitutes a methodological breakthrough, it does not follow necessarily that stylistic methods should be discarded in favour of 'scientific' direct dating. Rather, archaeologists need to face the problems inherent in the uses of both radiocarbon and stylistic methods more determinedly and critically, and to move beyond simple correlations that do not address the complexities of each approach. This needs to be done at the level of theory, method and interpretation (Rosenfeld and Smith 1997:409). In other words, dating, using whatever technique, is not the end-all of rock-art research. The style or 'manner of depiction' (Chippindale and Taçon 1993) always remains both relevant and important. Indeed, contrary to what Robert Bednarik (1995b, 1995c; see also Lorblanchet and Bahn 1993) and others might argue, style should never be abandoned as a chronological indi- cator. Our obsession with calculating absolute age can be counterproductive in the sense that it can distract us from a fuller understanding of the past: Ultimately what is of primary relevance about dating in archaeology is not the age as such, but the temporal posi- tioning of the thing dated in relation to other archaeologi- cal material. Age estimates expressed in radiocarbon years, useful to express this relationship, may be less meaningful expressions of temporality from an archaeo- logical point of view than are analyses of stylistic coher- ence or variance. Used in tandem, we expect that the two approaches to dating rock-art will facilitate a broadening and deepening of archaeological interpretations of the past (Rosenfeld and Smith 1997:409). A good example of the debate about dates versus style is the case of the Portuguese Côa valley engrav- ings, which style analysis suggested were Upper Palaeolithic but the results of various dating attempts suggested were anywhere between less than 200 to a few thousand years of age (Clottes 1998:123). This led to very heated debates with calls for the abandonment of style as a chronological indicator (eg. Bednarik 1995b, 1995c) to suggestions that a variety of new dating tech- niques were giving unreliable results (eg. Zilhão 1995b). Further research supports the idea that at least some of engravings are from the Upper Palaeolithic (Zilhão 1995a) but the debate over the age of Foz Côa and the supremacy of 'style' versus 'dates' continues. However, what if one has nothing to date, no reliable dates what- soever? Can valid, robust interpretation still proceed? Examples from southern Africa emphasise that it can, as 97</page><page sequence="4">Dowson (1998:73) notes in relation to paintings from the south-east: One difficult issue in researching the rock-art of the south-eastern mountains is its dating. There are no reli- able dates; the subject-matter suggests that much of the art has been produced in the last thousand or so years. Many researchers believe that the lack of a 'firm chrono- logical framework' hinders our ability to use rock-art in a meaningful way. But as Yates (1993:70) suggests, 'Archaeological data is not limited, only the minds that interpret it.' Further, 'the way forward for rock-art analy- sis is not to address issues of chronology but to theorise the art - a theorisation which must extend way beyond the stale discussions of terminology - and study its appearance and meaning in local and regional terms' (Yates 1993:35). This is what I have attempted for the south-eastern mountains (Dowson 1994). Studies like these go unnoticed by the chronocentrics because they effectively challenge their chronocentrism. The search for meaning The most important point to emphasise about meaning and interpretation is that there are many levels of inter- pretation, with three main ones to consider. Each level is more difficult to access, with an exponential increase in degrees of uncertainty. The first level (1) merely involves identifying what has been depicted, the subject matter, but even this can be fraught with problems as Macintosh (1977), Clegg (1977, 1978, 1979, 1991) and others have pointed out. The second level (2) involves exploring reasons why the subject was depicted where it has been found, both specific and more general. The third level (3) of interpretation has four sub-parts: (a) what the imagery meant for the artist; (b) what the imagery meant for the culture that produced it; (c) what the cultural significance of the imagery is from the per- spective of an outsider, namely ourselves; and (d) what the global significance of the imagery is in terms of cur- rent theories, models, and hypotheses about human development held by scientists. Thus it is important to distinguish between these 'ernie' and 'etic' forms of meaning from the outset and to emphasise which are being discussed when presenting the results of analysis. These different sorts of meaning are best understood by way of a hypothetical example: We come across an elaborate panel bearing almond-shaped designs that have a variety of appendages, indentations and internal designs; each design resembles a separate creature. By comparing them to known creatures we conclude the subject matter to be fish and are confident some are bar- ramundi, some are freshwater gar fish called 'long-toms' while the rest cannot be identified at the species level (statistical analyses support this conclusion). This is our first (1) level of interpretation. Our second (2) level of interpretation is suggested by an abundance of fish bones at the site and observations that fish (especially barra- mundi and gar fish) were important to diet in recent times. We conclude that these creatures were caught nearby, eaten at the site and were painted either before, in preparation for the catch, or after, to record the event (both of these are supported with ethnographic analogy; we are unsure which is most likely). Landscape studies then reveal the pivotal location of our site in the larger landscape, a location almost exactly between two impor- tant water holes. Stylistic analysis reveals the barra- mundi and the gar fish were painted by different people, perhaps each from a different water hole. Superimpositions reveal the unidentifiable fish to be older and that the addition of species-specific traits is a recent innovation. Our third (3) level of interpretation is informed by discussions with local Indigenous elders who tell us all about both actual and mythological fish and reasons why paintings provide a link between them, and the fact that one of the artists always painted barra- mundi because it was a personal symbol while another always painted gar fish because they tasted good (3a). They also confirm most paintings were done after the catch. All of this leads to a broader interpretation of what fish meant to the society as a whole and how they were used as a rich symbol for expressing abstract ideas and concepts, as well as aspects of the historic record (3b). It also leads us to explore what fish mean to ourselves and how we use or interpret them as symbols (3c). Finally, our analysis ends with a discussion about the importance of fish in human cultural evolution and the development of a theory that it was the skill, chance and risk of catch- ing fish that led to the first abstract religious thought and symbolism, prompting a world- wide symbolic revolution 40,000-50,000 years ago (3d). The results of various forms of archaeological dating at our site and others then allow us to examine how and when this world-wide fish culture changed and spread over time, until it was replaced by agricultural, processed food and vegie-vita- min cultures in different parts of the world. We are still at a loss as to why the Tasmanians stopped eating fish but win the annual fish-interpretation prize at some con- ference. However, the following year rival colleagues find new dating evidence that conflicts with our own and a lizard-symbol cultural development theory emerges, complete with dragons and Rainbow Serpents, forcing us to rethink, if not abandon, our 3d interpretation. However, it does not force us to abandon our 1, 2, 3a, 3b or 3c interpretations (but other things conceivably could do so, such as a finding that what we thought were fish actually are depictions of something else that resemble fish for us or that we had somehow misunderstood statis- tics, Indigenous consultants and/or the meaning of num- bers provided by dating experts). This leads to the second point about meaning and interpretation which is that, whether we like it or not, archaeology will always involve interpretations of the past and that new interpretations based on new pieces of evidence will emerge. Interpreting is not an evil to be avoided, rather something fundamental to all approaches to understanding past human behaviour; it also is funda- mental to science (see below). What is important is to let people know when one is interpreting, on what basis the interpretation has been made and what varied forms of 98</page><page sequence="5">analogical or direct evidence lend support to such inter- pretation. Different levels of interpretation should never be confused and as much as possible all forms of inter- pretation should always be based on data, either archaeo- logically derived or otherwise uncovered. In early European studies there was a preoccupation with mean- ing so that meaning was often forced on data (Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967) rather than rock-art imagery being used as data. This is true of some North American studies as well (Smith 1997), but everywhere today professional researchers are hopefully taking a much more cautious approach. As Rosenfeld and Bahn (1991: vi) note: The preoccupation with interpreting the meaning of art has not bedevilled rock art studies outside of Europe to the same extent. In Australia in particular, the study of art is a more recent development, and experience with living traditions has made researchers aware of the multivalency of artistic expression and of the complexity of its social function. Wherever possible, Rosenfeld encouraged in her stu- dents the exploration of meaning or the ways in which meaning is conveyed (eg., in reference to my own work in Arnhem Land see Rosenfeld 1994; Taçon 1989a, 1989b; Taçon 1994; Taçon and Chippindale 1994; Taçon et al. 1996; compare and contrast with McDonald 1993, 1994, 1998 and Officer 1991, 1992, 1998 for eastern New South Wales). After all, life without meaning is like a meal without wine - it's simply not complete. The trick is to find the best possible meaning or bottle of wine at the right price! The other secret is to remember that meaning changes over time, as Rosenfeld (1991:141) has argued for Panaramitee schema: It is the very simplicity of form of these schema which allows for a multiplicity of meanings according to rules of social context and rules of patterning, and this results in a highly flexible system of expression. The superficial sim- ilarities of motif form and gross frequencies identified among classic Panaramitee sites need not imply unifor- mity of cultural expression. It would also follow from Munn's analysis that such systems are amenable to accommodating shifts in meaning through time. Hence the basic motif vocabulary might be expected to survive with structural changes rather than with morphological changes to accommodate cultural change. Some of the more valuable interpretations of rock-art are multi-faceted, combining in particular landscape pat- terning with the social context of rock-art production, as Rosenfeld has advocated in her most recent work (1997b; see also Taçon 1994). Drawing on widespread recent ethnographic research, Rosenfeld distinguishes three very different contexts of production: rock-art said to be an Ancestral creation, rock-art that is a human cre- ation about the Dreamtime past/present; and rock-art that is 'a human creation about human concerns'. Each of these will be distributed differently within social land- scapes: The creation or maintenance of ancestral images is restricted to individuals according to their structurally determined identities. The art created in such contexts is narrowly constrained in terms of style and motif. Subject matter and style emphasize the nature of the artist's con- textualized relationship to a locale. In its reference to appropriately expressed concepts of the dreaming it expresses his/her structurally determined interests in the locale as defined via the legitimacy of the ideational sys- tem of social relations. The creation or renovation of such paintings is an act of expressing this classificatory and contextual identity, and of relationship to place via the spiritual power of the 'law'. This rock art therefore expresses and mediates social relations rather than explic- itly territorial affiliation. It is an affirmation of territorial affiliation via social relations as constructed through cos- mological principles. The execution of rock markings and of nonsacred designs is generally concurrent with rights of residence that are much more inclusive. In these contexts individual presence or concern may be celebrated in art, but this art does not evoke rights of control over place nor of ritual affiliation to it. It makes reference to the artist's individ- ual identity but it does not visually define his/her socially constructed identity (Rosenfeld 1997b: 296-97). Rosenfeld (1997b:297) concludes: To that extent rock art in its formal variation may be thought to express and determine a social landscape'. However, she also notes the complexity is far greater than simple models of 'reci- procity of access to resources between members of terri- torial groups' would suggest. Furthermore, she adds 'for- malized art systems... operate primarily, though not exclusively, to relate socially constructed identity-place relationships' (1997b:297) and she further distinguishes those that operate at the more social level from those that are more personal, such as mechanically made marks or commemorative images. Thus, by focusing on the social context of rock-art production Rosenfeld has woven together archaeological, ethnographic and landscape studies in a powerful way that has given us much greater insight into the meaning of the imagery in terms of the variety of roles it played in traditional society. The science of art versus the art of science Recently, there has been much debate on the role of sci- ence in the study of archaeology (see especially VanPool and VanPool 1999), including rock-art, with some people suggesting that archaeology or more generally, anthro- pology, has failed because it is not somehow a pure sci- ence. However, calls for a 'science of culture' by Tim O'Meara (1997) or a purely scientific approach to archaeology by Robert Bednarik (1992a, 1992b, 1993, 1995a, 1995d, 1997a, 1997b) have been shown to be ill- conceived, with sweeping generalisations used to attack anthropologists (Bahn 1997; Harris 1997; Ripoll 1997; Rosenfeld 1997a; VanPool and VanPool 1999). As Marvin Harris (1997b:410) notes: Those of us who include archaeology in sociocultural anthropology (or vice versa), who are mindful of biocul- tural interactions, and who operate with processual and holistic paradigms (Harris 1997[a]) will surely wish to reject O'Meara's peremptory and sweeping dismissal of 99</page><page sequence="6">our work. Contra O'Meara, contemporary anthropologists have produced substantial numbers of integrated, testable, and useful scientific theories and continue to do so. What many people fail to realise is that the study of the past is a combination of a scavenger hunt, detective story and jigsaw puzzle, all rolled into one. The chal- lenge is that there is no list, plot or picture on a box to refer to. Each discipline's techniques, methods and theo- ries provide new and different pieces of the puzzle but not only do we never find all the pieces but also we are never sure how exactly what we do find makes sense. Rigour, thoroughness, accuracy and reliability are thus essential. Wherever possible, a scientific approach is advocated (see Feder 1996) but we must never forget that the study of the past, whether through archaeology or some other framework, can never be complete and is always open to different levels of interpretation (Hassan 1997:1022) - a careful, considered multi-disciplinary investigation is thus best practice. As Rosenfeld (1996:6) has concluded, the study of the past is a social science, ideally grounded in social theory, relevant ethnography and an understanding of fundamental human processes: Understandings of the past can only be constructed by archaeological approaches to the material record of the past grounded in social theory. Our perception of this material record can be greatly enhanced by characterisa- tions that science and its dating technologies provide, but it is perceived and understood in the present. Its 'truth' in the past is not knowable; it is neither demonstrable nor refutable in a Popperian sense. As Susan Johnston expressed it (Johnson 1993:144): '... interpretations... are assessed in terms of how well they account for the evidence, and not whether they can be proven to be true in any absolute sense'. Van Pool and Van Pool (1999) go much further, argu- ing that both processual archaeology and post-processual archaeology are scientific approaches to the past because of the methods of analysis, logic and tests they employ. They also suggest that science is much more inclusive and intuitive than most archaeologists and others believe. 'Most discussions of science in archaeology have been, and continue to be, based on the "Legendary View of Science" (Kitcher 1992), a view that has been discred- ited' (VanPool and VanPool 1999:48). The legendary view of science states that scientists are completely rational, objective observers who meticu- lously record data; propose logical hypotheses; evaluate every scientific perspective without the influence of greed, personality conflicts, or dogmatism; and will read- ily drop any aspect of their pet theories anytime that con- tradictory evidence suggests a better perspective. While this view is widely accepted, it is fictional, as many sci- entists have observed (Van Pool and Van Pool 1999:40; see also Woodward and Goldstein 1996). The legendary view of science forms the basis of Bednarik's attacks on the discipline and his discrediting of the archaeological approach to rock art research. But interpretations of the past will always vary, and none of us are superhuman, so instead of quibbling about the supremacy of western science or whether archaeology is scientific, we should all strive for professionalism in our individual and collective approaches. Professionalism may mean having certain formal qualifications but more generally it means behaving in a skilled, capable and considerate manner. But above all it means striving for accuracy, scholarship and clear communication. This is what Rosenfeld has always advocated in her teaching and publications (eg. Rosenfeld 1997b). The story of rock-art research will always remain a human story involving cross-cultural dialogue and engagement. Indeed, we should never lose sight of the original intentions of rock-art research, whether via archaeology or other approaches - to better under- stand human history, past ways of life, the origins of cognition and art making, and ultimately, what it is to be human. The way we do this is by focusing on things like style, data and description, ethnography, chronol- ogy, meaning and a multi-disciplinary approach to our studies. This research framework, that Rosenfeld imparted to her students, not only provided the struc- ture to my PhD and subsequent research but also forms the backbone of a recent 'archaeology of rock-art', edited by Christopher Chippindale and myself (1998). This is one of the reasons we have dedicated that vol- ume to her among others. Finally, as Rosenfeld (1997b) points out, we should never forget the social context of rock-art - rock-art images are not neutral data sets for researchers or enthu- siasts to play with. They are important pictures from and about the past that can have great significance for living peoples: 'rock art can be variously an ancestral creation, a human creation about the dreaming or a human cre- ation about human concerns' (1997b:296). Analyses and discussions of rock-art imagery thus need to take this more fully into account. Not only will this lead to new and perhaps more robust interpretations but also it can lead to stronger relationships with Indigenous peoples who are worried that 'sterile' scientific investigations often do not adequately address or respect contemporary concerns about sites, pictures or the elders who look after them. Acknowledgments I would especially like to thank Andrée Rosenfeld for inspiration, encouragement and varied forms of assis- tance over the past 15 years.
