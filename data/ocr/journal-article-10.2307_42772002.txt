<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Japanese Avant-Garde Writers' Views of Gender Relations and Colonial Oppression in Manchuria, 1929-31 Annika A. Culver In this article, from a cultural historian's point of view, I examine issues of gender and colonial oppression in Manchuria by investigating what I term "hypermasculinity" and homosocial relations in the colonial space, as depicted in the poetry and short stories of two Japanese avant-garde writers, Anzai Fuyue (1898-1965) and Kitagawa Fuyuhiko (1 900-90). 1 Born in Japan, Kitagawa lived in southeastern Manchuria and Dairen from 1907-19, returning periodically in the mid- 1920s to visit Anzai, his mentor, friend, and, later, literary rival. In 1919, Anzai joined his father in Dairen and settled there until his 1934 return to Japan. Both writers, who spent formative years in colonial Manchuria because of fathers connected to the South Manchuria Railway Company (SMRC), were among Japan's most active proponents of avant-garde poetry and Surrealism with a strong proletarian tendency. In the prewar Japanese context, the term "avant-garde" is an anachronism first applied to modern art by the artist and poet Kanbara Tai in his 1923 Action manifesto.2 Other Japanese writers in the 1920s and 1930s rarely used this label to describe themselves, and Kitagawa and Anzai never proclaimed themselves avant-garde in the prewar period; rather, they saw themselves as proponents of modernism.3 However, it is a useful term Annika A. Culver is Assistant Professor of Asian History and Asian Studies Coordinator at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke (UNCP). As a cultural historian, her research interests include interdisciplinary investigations of Japanese cultural imperialism in the colonies and the role of Japanese intellectuals during wartime in cultural production.

Though anachronistic, my use of the term here respects scholarly convention in both the U.S. and Japan, due to Anzai and Kitagawa's rebellion in literary movements posited against conventions in established poetry as an institution (my reading of a definition of the European avant-garde proposed by Peter Bürger in 1984) and their left-oriented politics sympathetic to Marxism (a determining factor that scholars such as Wada Hirofumi use to distinguish the avant-garde from modernists).4 Thus, although "avant-garde" is often used fairly interchangeably with "modernist" in Japan, it remains constructive as a category that sets these two authors apart from their modernist counterparts who were unconcerned with questions of class, gender, and colonial oppression.5 Anzai and Kitagawa are important because of their allegiance to the proletarian movement and the fact that their writing, though equivocal, opposed the dominant colonial ideology. Both men wrote experimental literary works that were set in the colonial region of southeastern Manchuria at a time when the Japanese government was increas- ingly repressing left-wing literature in domestic Japan and promoting military expansion abroad in China.6 In the imperial capital of Tokyo in the late 1920s, currents of European avant-garde movements - including Surrealism, the Proletarian Literature movement, and Marxist critique - grew in popularity with Japanese intellectuals such as Anzai and Kitagawa, and soon permeated the cultural and discursive landscape. Intellectual ferment in literary and aesthetic movements, and the embrace of extreme political ideologies on both ends of the spectrum, also marked this progressively turbulent time period. By the late 1920s, the readership of these two authors had largely shifted from an active group of Japanese intellectuals in the colonies to cultural circles in the imperial center, though Anzai and Kitagawa's preoccupation with Manchuria and the particularities of its social fabric remained steady throughout their literary careers. Anzai dissolved his Dairen-based côterie magazine A ("A"sia) in December 1927, and, from afar, continued to collaborate with Kitagawa, who advanced their literary activities in Tokyo with the influential journal Shi to shiron (Poetry and poetics). The two friends' lasting fixation with gender and class in the Manchurian context is revealed in selections from Anzai 's 1 929 poetry collection Gunkan Mari (Battleship Mari) and from Kitagawa's 1 929 poetry collection Senso (War) and 1 93 1 short stories Reeru-1925 nen no kiroku (Rail -observations from 1925) and Hoppõ (The north), all set in areas around the Dairen metropolis and published during a time of burgeoning Japanese military involvement on the continent</page><page sequence="3">Annika A. Culver 93 and in Manchuria.7 Here, I focus primarily on selections from "Rail," but also include examples from the other texts just mentioned. Anzai's and Kitagawa's often surreal poems and short stories are important in that, while critically describing the imperialist project in Manchuria, they also reveal the complexities of the colonial space by reproducing the same colonialist gaze that they decry- despite their interest in or allegiance to Marxist ideals.8 Set in what appears to be a highly masculine frontier environment in colonial Manchuria, interactions between colonizer and colonized are thrown into stark relief in terms of the gender relations depicted by these two writers. At the turn of the twentieth century, southern Manchuria had become a venue for "colonial encounters" based on economic transactions and a complex hierarchy of power relations that included gender.9 These interactions- in such contrast to the relative normativity of domestic Japan- formed an environment rich in material that inspired these writers to critically, but also voyeuristically, depict the inher- ent sociopolitical contradictions of the colonial system of which they themselves were an intrinsic part. Hypermasculinity and Homosociality: Historical and Social Contexts of the Texts This article, though appearing in a publication featuring women's issues in the Japanese context, focuses on a historical analysis of gender relations and other hierarchies of oppression in the colonial space, as envisioned by two Japanese male writers who personally witnessed Manchuria's heavily masculine frontier environment. I argue that gender relations in this region in the early twentieth century can only be understood in light of the fact that, due to labor migration and other factors, there were only seven women to every ten men. I call this historical circumstance "hypermasculinity," and argue that it led to a particular mentality among men that privileged relations between males and simultaneously denigrated women, despite their scarcity and relative unavailability. The sociological and historical effects of this gender disparity, in turn, deeply influenced social relations. As a result, prostitution, a higher incidence of homosexuality, and "Wild West" customs (unrelieved male aggression and competition for access to women) were rampant in early twentieth-century Manchuria. Hypermasculinity also accounts for the prevalence of banditry and the residual custom of "wife stealing" in the more remote settlements. Wealthy Han Chinese and Manchu men could afford to support multiple wives or concubines, thus further diminishing the number of women available to their lower-class</page><page sequence="4">94 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 counterparts. The common practice of desperate families selling girls into prostitution to earn money to support their fathers and brothers further decreased the number of women available to lower-class men as wives. Other men arrived as migrant workers from China's Shandong and Hebei provinces, and returning to the families they had left behind in their native villages only in late winter, during the yearly spring festival (chunjie). These socioeconomic factors further caused working-class men to patronize prostitutes and compete for them if they could afford it. Another effect of Manchuria's gender disparity and the practice of selling girls as concubines or prostitutes was that servants in upper-class families were much more likely to be boys. Japanese men (like the fathers of Kitagawa and Anzai) usually refrained from bringing their wives and children to colonial Manchuria until they had spent several years there financing the building of a suitable house and finding servants acceptable to the other members of the family. These domestic arrangements often determined the success or failure of a Japanese male colonist. In the meantime, they patronized prostitutes and, as in domestic Japan, sometimes even assaulted their servants- though in Manchuria, as just mentioned, most servants were male. Modem Japanese literature is rife with tales of young men describing affairs with their lower-class female servants, in which these women both suffer their attentions and occasionally benefit from them on a financial, material, or emotional level. This sometimes mutual sexual exploitation, across class and even gender boundaries in Japan and Manchuria, was supported by a residual Confucian social context of male hierarchy in a once-polygamous society that attached relatively little stigma to adultery or homosexuality -as long as it did not result in illegitimate offspring or conflict with the production of a male heir. In the presence of an oppressed majority population, such as in the colonial space, the dominant minority availed itself of the privilege of its position to seek certain advantages, including sexual ones. Anzai and Kitagawa criticized this situation while also replicating the gaze of the colonizer, both in their unsympathetic portrayals of lower-class colonial women as prostitutes and in their salacious descriptions of homoerotic relations between male colonizers and native men. They usually depicted colonial natives as implicitly feminized objects, even within implied homosexual relations, with the Japanese colonizer literally "on top." Both Japanese writers highlighted these particularities in their works, and internalized their historical observations by portraying lower-class women as prostitutes and young male servants as sexually available. Though their obsession with these issues is quite obvious in the texts, it begs further analysis from a historical standpoint.</page><page sequence="5">Annika A. Culver 95 Migration and Gender Disparity in Southeastern Manchuria's Frontier Society Before analyzing specific examples of gender relations and the hierarchy of colonial oppression in Anzai and Kitagawa's texts, it is useful to further delineate the conditions that led to colonial Manchuria's remarkable gender disparity. An inevitable consequence of Japanese colonialism in Manchuria following the 1905 victory in the Russo-Japanese War was the urban migration of rural Han Chinese peasants who lost their land to Japanese settlers, and also the urbanization of formerly nomadic Mongols. These developments contributed to increasing numbers of lower-class coolie workers and to unstable settlements of predominantly male migrants on city fringes. In addition, as already mentioned, Chinese men flooded into southeastern Manchuria from Shandong and Hebei searching for work in urban factories, coal mines, and steel mills, and at Dairen's growing port facilities. The dislocation of Manchuria's indigenous inhabitants and influx of new immigrants from below the Great Wall, which accelerated after the late 1920s, also occurred in tandem with the reorganization of socioeconomic roles in the colonial hierarchy for non-Japanese of all social classes.10 This phenomenon is vividly described in Kitagawa and Anzai' s texts. In both writers' stories and poems, colonized peoples must adjust not only to authoritarian rule by an alien power but also to dislocations from their rural support networks in a ne w , urban context. Moreover, from 1 905 to 1 93 1 , the leased areas around the South Manchurian Railroad in southeastern Manchuria on the Liaodong Peninsula were policed by the Kantõ Army, which took over all of Manchuria by force after 1931 . As a consequence of these factors, colonial natives found themselves in a rough environment of great uncertainty, desperation, and distance from former village moral codes- an environment in which laws now favored the Japanese. Lower-class women, occupying the lowest position in a hierarchical flow of oppression in the colonial space, often served as the objects of these larger anxieties when they were raped, beaten, kidnapped by bandits, or sold into prostitution by their male counterparts. Moreover, as already indicated, a large disparity in the number of men to women characterized the Manchurian "contact zone,"11 a reality deeply affecting the perception of gender roles in a hypermasculine frontier society. From 1900 to 1931, Patrick Fuliang Shan estimates that the ratio of men to women of all ethnicities was roughly 1 ,000 men to 700 women in this region.12 The harshness of this frontier region- sandwiched between China proper, Mongolia, and Siberia- conjured up chilling tales of (usually male) mounted bandits, known as bazoku, in the minds of Japanese immigrants, thus garnering their support for organs of strict Japanese military control like the Kantõ Army.13 Native</page><page sequence="6">96 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 working-class laborers and servants were treated with a mixture of repulsion, suspicion, and erotic fascination by Japanese settlers, a conceit typical to many colonial societies. After its establishment in Dairen in 1907, the South Manchuria Railway Company (SMRC) brought large numbers of Japanese men to southern Manchuria for employment with the enterprise.14 As seen above, they usually arrived without their families, or remained unmarried until their situation settled and they could afford to hire the "help" necessary to sustain a colonial lifestyle. Chinese labor supervisors with nominal Japanese-language skills interfaced with the native population to supply coolie workers and even servants for their bosses. In 1929 alone, men of all ethnicities composed 82.8 percent of new immigrants to the region, while women accounted for only 17 percent.15 Consequently, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian women prostitutes were an accepted part of the landscape for Japanese and Chinese men of all social classes. Access to available women required money, leading to the emergence of class and ethnic hierarchies in brothels patronized by men of different social classes and ethnicities. Russian women attracted a higher- class clientele of Russian, Chinese, and Japanese men, while Chinese women accepted men of all ethnicities and social classes based on ability to pay. Japanese prostitutes catered mainly to Japanese clients and, occasionally, upper-class Chinese. (Some of these women had even emigrated to Manchuria because they could earn more than in domestic Japan). For example, in Kitagawa's short stories examined below, Russian prostitutes near SMRC worksites are patronized by middle-class Japanese engineers and managers whose families are presumably safely at home in Japan, far from the rough realities of the developing frontier area. Flocking to Manchuria as itinerant coolie laborers, impoverished lower-class Chinese men from Shandong and Hebei, who were driven by population pressures, also left their families at home. This further reinforced the masculine nature of this frontier society and promoted the rise in prostitution. Chinese researchers such as Cao Baoming have noted that during the busy season these men worked as laborers in cities, but in the off-season they often formed bands that raided and looted the countryside.16 Patrick Shan also asserts that Manchuria's skewed sex ratio contributed to notions of banditry, lawlessness, prostitution, and a masculine-gendered frontier society in Manchuria.17 These perceptions of the widespread prevalence of banditry (and general lawlessness among the lower classes of both genders) contributed to the brutality of Japanese colonial rule in southeast Manchuria, even though the bandits were in fact mostly confined to the mountains and forests of the north.</page><page sequence="7">Annika A. Culver 97 Anzai and Kitagawa both emphasize the masculine environment and social instability of the contact zone of southern Manchuria in their texts. Moreover, as their work shows, the Japanese fear of the lawless colonial native was mixed with an erotic fascination for the tall, strong physique of the coolie worker. (The Japanese, with their lower-protein, rice-based diet, tended to be shorter than their continental counterparts, and were awed by the size of native men despite their position as colonial overlords.) Thus, these two writers' portraits of Japanese capitalists and their associates, engaged in encounters with Chinese and other indigenous natives of all classes, show human relations being classified into economic or sexual transactions within the hypermasculinity of the frontier society of the colonial space. Anzai and Kitagawa lead their readers to implicitly contrast the exotic scenery and people of Manchuria with domestic Japan as a normative point of reference. Human relations among men in the colonial space are characterized by homosocial bonding between members of same socioeconomic class- and often by homoeroticism and economic transactions of various kinds (including sexual ones) between those of disparate classes, with the colonizer asserting his desiring gaze. Who is looking and what is seen give a measure of power to the usually male observer, though colonials often take advantage of this structure to gain a modicum of profit. Two separate and often conflicting realities exist within the writings of these Japanese avant-garde authors set in Manchuria: that of the relatively privileged poet as observer, and that of the (usually) lower-class Chinese subject. The Flow of Oppression in the Japanese Development of Colonial Manchuria In Kitagawa's 1931 short stories "Rail" and "The North," and in Anzai's 1929 poems, including "Kakö" (Estuary), male Han Chinese of various social classes work for the Japanese, and sometimes profit from this relationship while they oppress colonial peoples of even lower economic and educational levels. Colonial lower-class women appear at the very bottom of this flow, working as itinerant peddlers, prostitutes, and even beggars. In the stories and poems of these two authors, who accepts money from whom- and who initiates sexual relations - reveals where each person is positioned in a power hierarchy that seems to issue downward from the emperor himself at the pinnacle of the Japanese imperial state. For example, the following passage from "Rail," published in Chttõ kõron (Central review) in December 1931, clearly illustrates Mary Louise Pratt's description of colonial encounters in the contact zone as "usually involving conditions of coercion, radical inequality, and intractable conflict."18 In 1925, Kitagawa was invited by his father, an</page><page sequence="8">98 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 engineer with the SMRC, to view the company's development schemes in Manchuria in the hope of attracting him to work for the enterprise. The visit must have made a deep impression upon the young man because, six years later, he captured what he had seen in graphic detail. The complex hierarchies in colonial socioeconomic relations that he witnessed appear in a striking scene set in the winter of 1925. In the scene, three men- a Japanese finance representative (unnamed), a Japanese worksite manager (Hayata), and an upper-class Chinese employee (Chen)- are riding in a carriage from an SMRC worksite near the Mongolian border to a Japanese-style inn. The handsome young Chen, representing the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin, has recently emerged from the conductor's private railway car, where he was involved in a transaction involving either bribery or sex.19 Kitagawa deftly describes the characters' thoughts on the ride, and where each man stands on the ladder of socioeconomic relations in the colonial space, as administered by the Japanese-run SMRC (at this time an agent of Japanese economic and cultural imperialism): Chen smirks and contentedly strokes a wad of bills in the carriage, hoping to spend it on an expensive prostitute (with the author hinting that Chen has himself engaged in a sexual transaction with his Japanese boss Hayata in the previous scene); the Japanese worksite manager Hayata worries how he can afford to pay Chen and come up with other kickbacks essential to smooth working relations between colonizer and colonized (including bribes to the Chinese soldier at the gate allowing after- hours entrance into the city, and to the Chinese mailman to ensure reliability of the post); and the Japanese finance representative wonders how to explain to the Dairen SMRC headquarters these various costs engendered by colonial conditions of corruption and by the Japanese desire for the body of an exotic male or female native. By the end of "Rail," Hayata has retired due to ill health blamed on the cold and on dissolute sexual habits (tuberculosis and syphilis were endemic in Manchuria). An SMRC engineer called Baba in the story (possibly referencing Kitagawa's engineer father, since baba is colloquial Chinese for "father") jokes about this with one of the warlord Zhang Zuolin' s dapper, Japanese-educated Chinese officers, who makes the comment, "Oh, at that age, with so many women Thus Hayata's sexual predilections are depicted as extending to both genders and across socioeconomic classes, and seem to be representative of the erotic attractions of Japanese male colonists in positions of power. Kitagawa's penchant for sexually suggestive passages, discussed in more detail below, also supports this. Kitagawa's "The North" also opens with a homoerotic description of a ruggedly handsome young Chinese man, this time a houseboy, and closes by evoking the strong</page><page sequence="9">Annika A. Culver 99 body (and sexual organs) of a Chinese coolie laborer who is drying his clothing by the fire after running through a stream to flee from a fox near his worksite. Thus, Kitagawa's texts clearly show that even lower-class colonial men could become sexualized objects in the gaze of the Japanese male colonist. Whether this indicates (1) the author's projection of bisexual tendencies onto his characters, (2) a dismissive attitude toward women in general, (3) a more general Japanese erotic fascination with, and physical admiration of, their larger-bodied continental counterparts, or (4) a combination of the three is, of course, a key question addressed in this article. In the 1929 and 1931 works by Kitagawa and Anzai discussed here, Japanese men are afforded interiority, names, and the power to discern. But like the SMRC worksite manager Hayata in Kitagawa's "Rail," they are often portrayed as having become shockingly blind to the unequal realities of the colonial hierarchy, including the dehumanizing (or dismissive) treatment of women and the privileging of relations between men. Consequently, these male characters- even when feeling residual twinges of shame for their actions- are unable to do more than observe the inequities that reinforce difference, while they themselves commonly reduce human relationships to pure economics. Because the colonial space exists at such a perceived distance from the normative domestic space of Japan, actions considered appalling in the Japanese context are placed at a comfortable ethical distance for these men. The largely male Japanese readership of the Central Review and of Anzai's poetry collection Battleship Mari likewise participated in a voyeuristic consumption of these texts that must have reassured them of the comforts of home while describing an area of growing public interest. The view of the colonial space that Anzai and Kitagawa supplied also positioned the two writers themselves as distanced observers who did not personally step in to change the unequal conditions they witnessed. Their writings, appearing in print in Dairen and the archipelago, communicated to Japanese readers a less optimistic view of Japanese colonialism than that usually portrayed in the conservative press.21 But while critiquing the ravages of the imperial system, their poems and stories also conveyed the need for strict, organized Japanese control over a potentially unruly colonial population largely composed of young lower-class men. Both writers express this most strongly in how they portray colonial peoples interacting with each other. In Kitagawa's short stories, lower-class Chinese male workers at the bottom of the flow of oppression are often the only ones truly able to observe and understand the system of colonial exploitation they are subjected to (while</page><page sequence="10">100 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 being largely powerless to change these conditions). However, Kitagawa also reveals that, as labor supervisors or bribed lackeys of the Japanese, Chinese men often victimize their lower-class countrymen in acts of sadism much worse than the acts of their Japanese bosses, while themselves remaining victims of colonial inequalities. As we have seen in "Rail," Kitagawa implies that Chinese men sometimes even accepted money from their Japanese bosses for sexual favors. In addition, Anzai depicts Chinese coolies participating in the victimization of (female) child prostitutes at the very bottom of the social hierarchy, as will be discussed later. These writers each show the commonplace nature of sadism and victimization in the colonial space, both as inflicted by the Japanese and as enacted among colonial peoples. Kitagawa highlights this in his obsessive repetition of words like "whips," "backs," and "butts" in descriptions of the SMRC worksite in "Rail," and in the murderous desperation of the Chinese houseboy in "The North." The opening scene of this story eroticizes the shaved head and alluring appearance of a young Chinese man pressed into domestic service out of necessity, with Kitagawa comparing him to a novice monk in traditional language evoking sexuality. The reader first discovers the boy's fierce nature when he skins a cat and hangs its fur up on the wall in his room. Further into the story, he uses an axe to murder his father's new wife, who has neglected the care of his sick sister (infected with syphilis caught from a Japanese policeman who had raped her) after his mother's death. Some Japanese scholars believe that Kitagawa may have based this figure on his friend Anzai' s Chinese servant, who helped Anzai remain relatively mobile despite his crippled leg. Like other native characters in colonial literature, the Chinese boy is depicted as an exotic and violent figure, though capable of great loyalty. This preoccupation with colonial oppression and gendered violence is also revealed in Anzai's disturbing juxtaposition of fragile images with futility, such as the butterfly attempting to cover a vast expanse in northern East Asia in his famous 1929 poem "Spring."22 Anzai later expanded this prescient imagery into the unfolding psychic violence of the 1943 poem "Tartar Straits and Butterfly," in which the butterfly finally comes to rest on the muzzle of the narrator's gun.23 Though their methods of description differ and evince much equivocation, Anzai and Kitagawa both reveal in their texts that the violence of the colonial space (as well as men's victimization or dismissive attitudes toward women) issues from a hierarchy of oppression stemming from Japanese imperialism itself. In a key example from the ending of "Rail," which illustrates the SMRC' s ruthlessly efficient laying of the Tõkõ line linking eastern Mongolia to Fengtian (Shenyang) in</page><page sequence="11">Annika A. Culver 101 1 925, Kitagawa accurately describes the flow of oppression in the colonial space that led to Japanese (and Chinese) expressions of sadism and victimization like those depicted above by both writers. Having recently joined the Nihon Puroretaria Sakka Domei (Japan Proletarian Writers' League) in August 1931, shortly before "Rail" was published, Kitagawa implicates the SMRC colonial enterprise. Though I was unable to find concrete evidence either in the original Central Review text of "Rail" or in the postwar edition (published in a collection of proletarian writings in 1985), Kitagawa's revolutionary orientation since 1930- and penchant for politically and sexually inflammatory insinuations through the skillful manipulation of censorship marks- suggest that the first two sets oí fuse ji (censorship marks usually indicated by an X for each kanji) in the quotation below probably stand for "Tennõ" (Emperor) of the "Dai Nippon Teikoku" (Greater Japanese Empire). The third set of fuseji below, which is much more difficult to distinguish, seem to indicate a location (possibly kakumei no kokka, or "revolutionary country," i.e., the Soviet Union), while the fourth set of marks appears to describe the train (possibly jiyü, or "freedom"). Despite the intrusion of censorship, this ending of "Rail" scathingly indicts a system that offers no escape from brutality, and shows the violent enforcement of the inflexible socioeconomic roles of Japanese and Chinese positioned by the SMRC into the colonial power hierarchy in Manchuria: Wang's whip continued to resound on the backs of six hundred coolies. The manager continued to bark at Wang's back. The Taonan office hounded this manager by phone. The Taonan office was tapped by the telegraph of the Dairen headquarters. The one at the very top, inflicting the whip to the butt of the Dairen headquarters, was the XX [emperor] of the XXXXX [Greater Japanese Empire]. At the scene, toward the XXXXX of the coolies, the XX train was sent out. On the endless, spacious plain, the new rail stretched out day by day. The work must not delayed. Absolutely no kind of trouble should creep in at any time. On the other side of the horizon, the Communist guerillas ( kyõsan gerira ) are creating their own liberated space. And so, this strength was reaching out rapidly. Up onto their backs!24 Kitagawa's "Rail," subtitled "Observations from 1925," appeared in the Central Review in December 1 93 1 , just months after the September 1 8 Manchurian Incident ( Manshü</page><page sequence="12">102 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 jihen), and foretold how the railroad would be extended at all costs. (The incident was blamed on Chinese Communist conspirators blowing up a portion of track near Fengtian [contemporary Shenyang], but in fact, Kantõ Army officers had staged this to create an excuse for Japan to invade Manchuria.) As a concrete extension of Japanese imperialism and a bulwark against the expansion of Soviet Communism to the north, the rail laid by the semi-private/semi-public SMRC could tolerate no delay, despite the inevitable intru- sion of political unrest. In "Rail," Kitagawa prophetically describes the rising Communist strength to the east, hinting at the growing resistance movements in northern Korea (close to the Jiandao area, near China's contemporary Yanbian district) and among Chinese peasants in northern Manchuria (now Heilongjiang Province).25 Kitagawa portrays the railroad as an almost elemental force, sustained by the psychic emanation of power that filters from the Japanese emperor on down the rungs of a complex ladder of fear and brutality, until it animates even the hands of the Chinese labor supervisor Wang. And just as the Chinese coolies endure Wang's whip, so Wang is subject to the orders of his Japanese manager, who must in turn satisfy the Taonan office, which is in its turn under the control of the Dairen headquarters. Elided from the text in censorship marks, but clear from the context, the person at the very top, wielding the metaphorical whip, is the emperor of Japan. The invisible source of power in the flow of oppression caused by the colonial hierarchy is the Japanese emperor himself, presumably in the form of the imperial government and its role in colonial affairs. According to Herbert Bix, Hirohito did not take much personal interest in colonial affairs until after the Manchurian Incident, when his lack of condemnation of the Kantõ Army soon promoted Japanese military adventurism in this region and throughout northeast China.26 On the next level below the emperor, both in "Rail" and in Kitagawa's earlier 1929 poetry collection War, the Japanese working for the SMRC are largely oblivious to their cruel treatment of Chinese workers, who function as integral components of this hierarchy of oppression, thus ensuring the continuity and prosperity of the Japanese empire. The Japanese SMRC managers permit this by subscribing to a discourse of colonial development that emphasizes modernity and efficiency. Kitagawa further implies that this system succeeds because Chinese labor supervisors (of a slightly higher socioeconomic level than their workers) harbor no ethnic solidarity that might make them sympathetic to the coolies below them. Most strikingly, both Japanese and Chinese labor supervisors are blind to the brutal violence and forced dehuman- ization that the colonial enterprise engenders, in which people are treated as objects or</page><page sequence="13">Annika A. Culver 103 machines- and in which objects or machines are treated as more valuable than the lives of the colonized people. As a proletarian writer critical of the capitalist enterprises implicated in imperialism, Kitagawa highlights the elements of Fordism and rationalization at work in the efficiently run SMRC worksite, where the labor force is infinitely expendable, like the cogs in a smoothly functioning machine in which "absolutely no kind of trouble should creep in at any time."27 Chinese observer Liu Shanzheng has noted that, in his town in northern Manchuria, as many men died as railroad ties were laid by them, when the railroad lines were extended in the mid-1930s.28 The SMRC's expansion northward was supported by an efficient system of poorly paid, often forced labor, despite the human costs, due to its high economic and strategic significance to imperial Japan. Within the colonial space, in contrast to domestic Japan, encounters between people of unequal positions took on a tenor of dehumanizing objectification, and the trappings of modernity (like telephones, train cars, or stoves) functioned as ominous, out-of-place portents of a surreal reality that only threatened to further efface the human. The most important objects in the SMRC office in "Rail" are described in oddly anthropomorphic terms: a noisy pot-bellied stove issuing a comfortable heat, and the loud, old-fashioned telephone with "eyeballs" linking the office to the modern world. In colonial Manchuria, these two objects were crucial to the success of the SMRC enterprise because they represented life-sustaining heat and remaining in touch with company headquarters in Dairen. (Dairen had an impressive number of telephone owners in the 1920s, surpassing even Tokyo.) As a colonial outpost of a Japanese semi-governmental enterprise, the SMRC was in direct communication via telephone with the imperial capital in Tokyo and, through this new form of technology, served as a representative of the project of Japanese imperialism.29 In Kitagawa and Anzai's texts, those who are conscious of political inequalities and aware of the disparities engendered by the capitalist system are usually colonial peoples themselves. In "Rail," the Japanese SMRC employees overlook the mechanisms of oppression, in which some can play baseball as others starve; only Liu, the Chinese Communist labor organizer, clearly sees the inhumanity of continuing construction of the rail line during the harsh Siberian winter. The conglomerate's diligent application of Fordism and rationalization has turned its workers into the cogs of a machine- not men who might freeze to death living in open rail cars or starve on a diet of substandard millet porridge. Kitagawa is almost obsessive in describing the bowel movements of the</page><page sequence="14">104 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 Chinese coolie workers, and the fact that they suffer from piles. Perhaps he merely means to highlight the fact that they suffer from the same ailments anyone would under these conditions, but the effect still seems voyeuristic- and designed to elicit disgust rather than sympathy. In the hope of alleviating the severe conditions of these workers, Liu proposes changes to Wang, the Chinese labor supervisor, who only responds with more lashes of his whip. At the end of the story, he cruelly tortures Liu as an example to others, tying him to the end of a train that drags him to death. Liu's futile attempts to organize the workers lead to nothing, except to show readers the unavoidable violence filtering down through an exploitative colonialist system sustained by the brutality of Japanese militarism. This is highlighted in the story's concluding image, quoted above, with the emperor at the summit of a complex ladder of oppression. Gender Relations in Colonial Manchuria in Texts by Kitagawa and Anzai The hierarchy of oppression in the colonial space, as described by Japanese avant-garde writers like Kitagawa and Anzai, is strikingly portrayed in the inequality of gender relations among the Han Chinese poor of Manchuria, for whom the selling of daughters into prostitution was common and women received the least economic resources, often forcing them to steal food, beg, or sell their bodies. At the extreme bottom of the colonial hierarchy in the hypermasculine space of Manchuria were young lower-class prostitutes servicing male Chinese coolies, and older women forced into the indignity of begging. Prostitution, hard liquor, and opium were often the endpoint of a coolie's hard-earned wages, offering a brief respite from debilitating physical labor and low pay, while the Confucian (or bourgeois) notion of ancestral honor or ethics, and tradition of the intact, extended family (Ch. jia' J. ie), were exclusive to wealthy Chinese or colonial Japanese. In a notable example of the challenges facing the proletarian family in Manchuria, Kitagawa's story "Rail" begins with a description of a one-eyed Mongolian woman with two malnourished, scabby-eyed sons mature beyond their years fighting each other in sibling rivalry and ill-temper caused by starvation. The woman is first seen stealing from the baskets of a fishmonger who sells his wares at exploitative rates. (This scene, like others in "The North" and "Rail," also appears in a poem in Kitagawa's earlier collection War).30 Later in the day, she enters the SMRC office holding a baseball that has landed in her pigsty.31 The fact that she ventures to pass through the intimidating gates of the office</page><page sequence="15">Annika A. Culver 105 to return the ball is an act of desperate defiance for a lower-class colonial native. It is also one that demonstrates the decadence of the employee ballgame and highlights the stark contrast between the Japanese employees' quest for recreation and the woman's hand-to- mouth struggle to survive.32 In fact, baseball was an important sport for the SMRC: not only did it symbolize physical prowess and imperial Japan's successful application of modernity, but SMRC teams often beat their domestic Japanese counterparts in competition.33 Emboldened by hunger and exhaustion, the woman waits silently by the entrance, holding the dung-covered baseball: "What do you want?" "Give her the leftovers." "Give it to her. Give it to her (Yare, yare)" two or three men let out here and there, with loud voices.34 Though "Give it to her" could also have a vulgar sexual connotation, the shouted response of the young male employees is more an order to get rid of her than a call to give her some small token of help. A starving colonial native woman setting foot in the recreation part of the enterprise's outpost is an embarrassment to the employees inculcated in the SMRC's supposed "civilizing mission" in the region. This unnamed woman returns at the end of the story, where Yu, the friénd of the Communist labor organizer Liu, is shown to be her son. When Yu's relationship to Liu is discovered, the authorities follow him home as an "absconded worker" from the worksite. As Yu reunites with his mother in tears, a Japanese policeman whips her, apparently believing that she is trying to prevent Yu's capture, and is therefore a hindrance to his maintaining order and putting down Communist activism in the region. The fact that "Rail" is framed by these two scenes of a native Manchurian woman and her sons is notable because it realistically reveals the struggles of a lower-class woman in the colonial space. Her image is devoid of the usual exotic allure or seductive pity attached to the figure of the prostitute in Kitagawa and Anzai's other works (and typical of other non-proletarian contemporary Japanese accounts of lower-class women). Her rather sympathetic portrait seems to serve as Kitagawa' s ironic commentary on the powerlessness and poverty of the colonized proletarian family at a time when the Japanese state was touting the wholeness of the (bourgeois) national family in domestic Japan. In the works by these two Japanese authors, relations between men usually take precedence in the story's plot or poem's focus; sympathetic female characters such as</page><page sequence="16">106 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 Yu's mother rarely appear, except as marginal figures engaged in prostitution, smuggling, petty larceny, or other illegal activities. In particular, Kitagawa's poetry and short stories set in the hypermasculine contact zone of Manchuria feature few women of any nation or social class. When Kitagawa does include them, he usually sexualizes lower-class women, such as the seductive Korean barmaid Sairen in "The North," who is violated by a Japanese customs officer as she attempts to smuggle liquor under her skirts into Korea from Manchuria, and who pays a Chinese innkeeper for lodging by granting him sexual services. Characters like Sairen serve as a canvas on which to sketch the depredations of Japanese colonial rule. In his poems Anzai, too - aside from a few compassionate portraits of his autistic sister Mari- tends to provide only a surface sketch of a prostitute or café waitress, as in Kitagawa's earlier works. In their poetry set in the colonial space, both writers portray women engaged in the sex trade in clichéd, metaphorical terms, comparing them to a flowing river (Anzai in "Estuary," from Battleship Mari ) or a wilted flower servicing a military general (Kitagawa in "Great Army Reprimand," from War).35 While titillating the Japanese male reader with these descriptions, the authors create a nightmarish vision of the colonial space as a place permeated by sexual perversity in a system of oppression with no escape for women. This oneiric landscape is fraught with the hint of violence ready to erupt at any time. Both poets thus capture how the colonial space was fashioned by the Japanese overlords into an arena of brutality where sexual violence and prostitution were a part of everyday existence. Japanese literature scholar William Gardner proposes that certain motifs in Anzai's poems "suggest a private reenactment of global seductions and violence.'^36 Many of the colonial encounters in the contact zone that Anzai depicts are between either Japanese men and prostitutes or Chinese coolies and prostitutes. Thus, the inequalities of empire are reproduced in the privacy of the brothel or bedroom (where colonized women are always at the literal bottom of the colonial hierarchy), and validate those acted out in public, with the poet as the curious observer coldly narrating a world without reprieve from victimization. Yet, while displaying the terrible human cost of imperialism for both colonizer and colonized, Kitagawa and Anzai's equivocating works each give the reader a voyeuristic glimpse into the alluring sordidness of the colonial space through the lens of fiction. In his own words, Kitagawa once even described Anzai as a "contemporary hermit" with literature as one of his few consolations.37 He believed that his friend and mentor often positioned himself as a literatus comparable to a Tokugawa-era eccentric who was fascinated by ancient Chinese culture but decried the conditions of the present day. In</page><page sequence="17">Annika A. Culver 107 Anzai's poetry collection Battleship Mari, Japanese as well as colonized women serve as a physical canvas for the twisted male desires arising out of the unnatural perversions generated by the colonial hierarchy of imperialism. The narrating poet appears to be a distant, coldly vacant observer of the decadence of a fictive colonial space populated by metaphor and exotic Chinese characters. In "Estuary" from the above collection, Anzai shows the female body as a metaphor for the depredations of Japanese imperialism. The socialist critic and former Mavo member Ogata Kamenosuke once referred to this poem as one of Anzai's most sublime works.38 The poet's descriptive scene criticizes existing realities while perhaps also arousing the Japanese male reader: The warped sun once again fell behind the roofs. On the dry floor of the attic, tethered by a hemp rope, a girl was restrained. Every evening the Chinamen came with muddy feet and violated39 the girl. Under such ravaging, the girl imagined a boundless river behind the endless roofs, and within the dark comfort a frail breast endured. A river actually flowed boundlessly behind such endless roofs.40 The estuary evokes the entrance to the girl's body while inscribing it onto the map of imperialism. Entrances to rivers lead inland, deeper into territory to be controlled, conquered, or exploited for resources. This poem reflects the timelessness and everydayness of sexual violence under the "warped sun" of Anzai's fictive colonial space. The poet, in depicting this fictional warped sun which sets, as opposed to rises, perhaps equates this image with the eventual decline of the Japanese empire due to its moral decadence. However, rather than Japanese oppressors, it is lower-class Chinese men who repeatedly use this young girl for violent sexual release. The fact that the men do not remove their dirty shoes or wash their muddy feet would have been distasteful, as well as a cultural taboo, for the Japanese reader. Imprisoned in a dusty attic and tied with a rope as a sexual slave, the girl's only consolation is the dream of a river flowing freely, without bounds. The fact that Anzai chooses to portray Chinese coolies participating in the oppression of the colonial system heightens the poem's cool horror. Eluding questions of ethical responsibility, the poet's ambiguous language creates an aestheticized vision of cruelty, even sounding melodious when read aloud. Anzai's works of the late 1920s and early 1930s are less optimistic about proletarian revolution than those of his friend and rival Kitagawa, showing the inequalities and perversions of colonialism rather than proposing any ultimate solution.</page><page sequence="18">108 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 Fascination with Colonial Bodies: Physical Labor and Homoeroticism in Manchuria Both writers' eroticization of the body of the colonized (of all social classes) and Kitagawa's strange preoccupation with the colonized body's physical functions parallel the Japanese imperial obsession with labor and physical work. This obsession is echoed in official accounts and photo collections from the time, as seen in the SMRC's pictorial Manshu gurafu (Manchuria graph), published 1933^44. Kitagawa's emphasis is partially explained by his interest in proletarian literature. After he joined the Japan Proletarian Writers' League in 1931, his works reveal an almost sexualized interest in the body of the coolie and his incredible physical endurance, while also describing the abject conditions of his labor. Kitagawa's proletarian vision of the Chinese "other" is highly equivocal, given his eroticization of the Chinese male body and gratuitous repetition of descriptions of the bodily functions of the coolies at their worksite. In support of his anti-capitalist views, this descriptive repetition does underline the fact that these laborers are seen as nothing but part of a machine, cogs in a system they have little ability to change. However, in "The North," and especially in "Rail," the words kintama ("testicles") and shiri ("butt") appear over and over in the text pertaining to male workers of all classes and ethnicities (including, as already mentioned, an excruciatingly detailed description of the coolies' bowel movements near the frozen worksite). Part of Kitagawa's intention seems to be to show the humanity and physicality of these workers, who are forced to labor like machines that do not feel cold, hunger, weariness, or desire. However, the repetitive descriptions of their body parts soon become gratuitous and are seemingly meant to titillate the Japanese male reader. As explained in an earlier section, "Rail" also features an interesting example of a Japanese manager's homoeroticized encounter with one of his employees, Chen, a Chinese native of Manchuria (albeit in Japanese drag). Hayata, the Japanese head of the SMRC Taonan office, notices what he initially thinks is a handsome young Japanese employee checking the quality of a supply of used rail ties just imported from domestic Japan: In this spot, a young man held white chalk in his hand to make inspection marks, and went back and forth in the same place. One could only believe that it was a Japanese in looking at his overcoat with the otter-fur collar, but his flashy navy-blue socks peeking out from his brogues told [Hayata] that it was a Chinaman. The man stopped and stood. And so [Hayata] caught a glimpse of his profile.41</page><page sequence="19">Annika A. Culver 109 Not surprisingly, Chen's socks betray his Chinese nationality despite his elegant coat, as do his averted eyes after he catches the gaze of the higher-ranked Japanese finance representative who is visiting from the Dairen headquarters. In the absence of clear racial distinctions, ethnicity and nation are determined by clothing and how it is worn. The finance representative notices Hayata staring at Chen, and says, "He wants money, we gotta pay him a little more," and then orders Chen to serve tea to Hayata in the conductor's private car.42 As an ironic joke, Kitagawa cleverly uses the imagery of the two younger men trying to pull the middle-aged Hayata up the waist-high step to the rail car: "Two young butts made an effort and got up with a scoot, but Hayata's aged heavy ass just couldn't get it up."43 What actually occurs in the car is not clear, except that it takes a long time and money changes hands: afterward, both Hayata and the finance representative must join Chen to quickly finish his job of checking the railroad ties, and a wad of bills is passed to the smirking young dandy. Apparently, the ties are a mix of new (possibly inferior) Chinese materials and used ones shipped in from Japan. Chen is a go-between representing the Manchurian warlord Zhang Zuolin's government, for whom the private rail is being built by the SMRC. In 1925, Zhang collaborated with the Japanese to consolidate his power over Manchuria- only to be assassinated by a bomb in his rail car in 1928, after the Kantõ Army deemed him detrimental to Japanese interests. Chen's smirk points to some illegal transaction involving bribery and/or sexual favors. Perhaps he has been bribed to allow defective rails and ties to pass as useable materials so that the SMRC' s objectives can be met, or perhaps he has given Hayata something besides tea. The latter is implied by the considerable time spent in the conductor's car as well as by Kitagawa's many references to the men's anatomy. As seen in the passages cited earlier, in the colonial space, human encounters between disparate classes, nations, and ethnicities often followed quite different social rules than in domestic Japan. In Manchuria, the power dynamics of the colonial hierarchy further complicated human relationships between peoples of unequal socioeconomic positions or ethnicities and, according to these texts, even stimulated the sex trade and sexual perversions. I previously mentioned that Kitagawa's story "The North" begins with a homoerotic description of a Chinese houseboy with a shaved head (possibly modeled after Anzai's own beloved servant), who is described as possessing a "strange charm." In Kitagawa's postwar expansion of this text into the long prose poem Hanran (Flood, 1948), the homoerotic nature of this description is much more obvious, with the narrator explaining in greater detail this figure's uncanny allure. Chosen for their attractive looks</page><page sequence="20">1 10 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 and their ability to run a household, Chinese houseboys (boi) assumed the role of a butler, performing many of the same tasks as a Japanese housewife. Due to Manchuria's gender disparity, plenty of young Chinese men were available for employment when Japanese and Korean female maids could not be procured. As in domestic Japan, young lower-class servants were often sexually exploited. In Manchuria, these male servants sometimes suffered similar treatment but remained in employment for economic reasons. In Taishõ and early Shõwa modernist poetry by Kitagawa, Anzai, and others that is set in domestic Japan (rather than in colonial Manchuria), homoeroticism and idolization of the young male body was common, whether in a Japanese or a westernized setting. However, a key difference was that the hierarchy of the male gaze and a man's ability to initiate relations were related directly to either his age or his economic power- and were negotiated between men of the same nation and ethnicity. The two writers' earlier poems also portray women, sometimes café waitresses, as decorative objects to be fought over in male rivalry, whereas those depicting bishõnen ("beautiful youth") are generally homoerotic, with aestheticized descriptions of the desired boy. Poems in Kitagawa's second poetry collection, Thermometer and Flower, written in his early twenties while staying with Anzai in Dairen, including one entitled "Pallid W.C.," feature pale Japanese youth wandering in the moonlight or drifting aimlessly through European-style parks looking for love.44 Anzai's 1 929 collection Battleship Mari also contains several examples of the decadent image of a sickly but charming "beautiful youth" in a westernized setting. This figure in the Japanese setting contrasts strikingly with the erotic descriptions of well-muscled, tall Chinese coolie laborers in colonial Manchuria. In addition, all the descriptions in a Japanese or westernized setting lack the raw brutality of the inescapable mechanisms of physical and sexual coercion in the colonial system. Kitagawa and Anzai thus show that, in the rugged Manchurian environment developed and exploited by Japanese men under the SMRC colonial enterprise, the ever-present desire for a (transacted and always unequal) union with the body of the colonized man or woman paralleled the exploitation of the land. Conclusion: Surrealism and Equivocation in the Writings of Anzai and Kitagawa In the late 1920s and early 1930s, these two Japanese avant-garde writers compellingly portrayed natives oppressed by the systematic economic and social inequalities in the colonial space, while also stimulating the voyeuristic appetites of a Japanese male readership hungry for descriptions of the exotic Asian continent. Nowhere were these</page><page sequence="21">Annika A. Culver 111 inequalities more apparent than in the realm of gender relations, as shown by Kitagawa and Anzai's dismissal of colonial women from the text altogether, or depiction of these lower-class women as prostitutes or beggars who occupied the lowest position in a hierarchy of oppression. Anzai and Kitagawa reveal a hierarchical colonial system in which lower-class colonized peoples rarely had a place beyond serving their overlords, and were relegated to the slums despite satisfying the imperial ambitions and sexual appetites of Japanese colonial enterprises (most commonly depicted in the form of the SMRC). Working-class women worked as prostitutes servicing men of all social classes and ethnicities, while laborers sustained the economic prosperity of Dairen and constructed impressive new Western buildings that displayed the modernity of the Japanese colonizer. These two striking realities of class, gender, and ethnic difference collide in the depictions of these two authors. However, Anzai's and Kitagawa's descriptions in their poetry and prose often border on ethical equivocation, which dampens any strong critique of imperialism, for they sketch the impenetrable surfaces of colonialism with a crystalline gaze devoid of sentimentality. One explanation could be the two writers' flirtation with Surrealism as a mode of literary expression. Each man presents his own (sur)reality played out on the surfaces of the colonial space- Anzai via an opulent, exotic decadence densely packed with obscure Chinese characters, and Kitagawa via the razor-sharp splicing of incongruities to generate shock and awareness of social inequalities, along with a cinematic, almost stream-of-consciousness technique of description. Anzai's obsession with the Asian exotic is shown in his descriptions of the body of the colonized, accompanied by his constant citing of geographical place names referencing the continent and his use of a large range of cryptic kanji. And, although in 1930 Kitagawa broke with the more formalistic advocacy of Surrealism espoused by Poetry and Poetics, "The North" and "Rail" cannot be read simply as Socialist Realist pieces of pure proletarian literature. Rather, these works incorporate a surrealist lack of closure, stream-of-consciousness narration, fragmentation, and disjunctive narrative, as well as a disorienting shift in interiority with multiple narrators. Although the literary aspects of the works of these two Japanese avant-garde authors are not the primary focus of this article, the attraction to Surrealism may explain why Anzai and Kitagawa portray social relations in the colonial space in such a form, as discussed above. Both writers attempt to erase the distance between the observing poet and the colonial "other" via experiments in vision and narrative. However, their predominant</page><page sequence="22">112 U.S.-Japan Women's Journal No. 37, 2009 view of the Chinese laborer or prostitute is that of an object whose essential surface cannot be penetrated (metaphorically), and which can therefore only be observed or purposefully used. James Lastra asserts that Surrealists, including the Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel, "identified what he saw as a Surrealist tendency to 'use' bourgeois society's 'others' to negate the cultural status quo while never giving others their due. The Surrealists, he thought, redeemed these others (workers, criminals, Africans, the insane) only by using them as projections of their own desires."45 Such descriptions- in which Kitagawa and Anzai project their desires onto the body of the native- show their indebtedness to Surrealism while also revealing the very equivocation and stark inequalities intrinsic to the Japanese colonial experiment in Manchuria.

From 1910 to 1918, socialist activities in Japan had entered a "frozen" period due to government suppression in the wake of the 1910 assassination plot against the emperor. 7.

The Manchukuo government began to forcibly evacuate Han Chinese peasants after 1933 for mass settlement plans by the Japanese imperial government. An earlier model, organized by the Kantõ Army after 1931, involved the creation of concentration-camp-like "villages" called shüdan buráku (collective hamlets) into which farmers in border regions near Korea were forced in "bandit pacification" efforts. Driven off their land, those who could flee flooded into the cities and ports, taking manual labor jobs. 11. "Contact zone" is another term coined by Mary Louise Pratt.

In the mid- 1920s, when Japanese control over Manchuria was limited to the southeastern part of the Liaodong Peninsula and the leased area around the SMR toward Changchun, the Japanese government collaborated with Zhang Zuolin to gain influence in northern Manchuria. However, when Zhang favored independence from Japanese interests and extended his power below the Great Wall, the Kantõ Army swiftly plotted to eliminate him. They succeeded in June 1928 by blowing up his rail car near Shenyang. 20. Kitagawa, Reeru , in Nihon puroretaria bungaku , 162.</page><page sequence="25">Annika A. Culver 115 21.
