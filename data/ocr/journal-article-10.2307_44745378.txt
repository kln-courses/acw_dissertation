Crandall and Greg Shaw University of Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics Copyright © 2003 SAE International ABSTRACT The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the responses, repeatability, and durability of the Thor-Lx/Hlllr and Hybrid lll/Denton lower extremities in frontal sled tests. Effectiveness of the two limb types was studied by evaluating responses in different test configurations using existing and proposed Injury Assessment Reference Values (lARVs) for both leg designs. Hybrid III or Thor-Lx legs were attached to the distal femurs of a 50th percentile male Hybrid III dummy, which was subjected to three series of 56 km/h frontal sled tests with and without toepan intrusion. Due to the design differences, many of the absolute response values were different between the Hybrid III and Thor-Lx legs. The expanded measurement capabilities, modified geometry and refined responses of the Thor-Lx limbs provide a more thorough and conservative judgment of injury risk. The Thor-Lx legs produced repeatable results throughout this series of tests and demonstrated sufficient durability under the severe loading conditions. INTRODUCTION This paper presents results from sled tests performed to evaluate the Thor-Lx Hybrid III retrofit (Thor-Lx/H 1 1 1 r, or simply Thor-Lx) dummy lower extremity recently introduced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The prevalence and importance of lower limb injuries in car crashes has been well documented in the literature, and it is widely believed that lower limb injuries need to be addressed from a safety point-of-view [1], In order to better investigate lower limb injuries, the NHTSA set out to develop an advanced lower extremity as a part of its advanced frontal crash test dummy program [2]. The first prototype in this design process was the ALEX (Advanced Lower Extremity), which was developed by the NHTSA Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) [3]- The ALEX design included the thigh, leg, ankle and foot, and was mounted to the pelvis of the Hybrid III and TAD dummies. Many design aspects of the ALEX were similar to those for the Hybrid III, including the knee slider and the tibia shape. Ball bearings were added to the knee slider, however, to prevent binding which was found to occur in some modes of loading. The tibias included additional force and moment measurement capabilities at the proximal and distal locations, as well as anterior surface load cells. Ankle joint design for the ALEX was markedly different than the Hybrid III, employing an orthogonal universal joint instead of a ball- and-socket. Rotary potentiometers were fitted to measure dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and inversion/ eversión rotations. Available biomechanical data were used to prescribe the 45° dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and 30° inversion/eversion ranges of motion, but ankle stiffness was only defined with urethane joint stops at the rotational limits [3]. Due to expanded biomechanical data and deficiencies in the ALEX design, the NHTSA developed an updated set of design specifications for the second generation Advanced Lower Extremity, ALEX II. The biomechanical data used for the ALEX II specifications were collected primarily at the University of Virginia [4] and Renault [5]. One important design feature required in the ALEX II was continuous ankle joint moment-angle properties in dorsiflexion/plantarflexion and inversion/eversion, with specifications based on human volunteer and cadaver data [4-5], Centers of rotation for dorsiflexion/ plantarflexion and inversion/eversion were separated to more closely represent the distinction between the human ankle and subtalar joint. Resistance to dorsiflexion was further increased by the inclusion of an Achilles tendon, which was intended to mimic the passive resistance of the triceps surae muscle group. Another significant design change was the straightening of the tibia shaft, which eliminated axial load-induced moments in the tibia load cells. Instrumentation on the ALEX II included forces and moments at the proximal and distal tibia, ankle rotations about three axes, foot accelerations and Achilles tendon tension. The NHTSA worked with Applied Safety Technologies Corporation (ASTC) and GESAC, Inc. to build two independent prototypes of the ALEX II, which underwent extensive biofidelity testing at the University of Virginia [6], 85</page><page sequence="2">Following the biofidelity testing, design elements of the ASTC and GESAC prototypes were combined into a finalized version, which became known as Thor-Lx (Figure 1). GESAC modified the tibia shaft design to improve axial impact response by inserting a compliant element just distal to the upper tibia load cell. Other slight modifications were also made, and then the first Thor-Lx prototype was released in September of 1998 and underwent biofidelity testing at the University of Virginia, TRL, and Renault [7]. Following another round of modifications, a second prototype was released in December of 1998, which was again tested at TRL, Renault and the University of Virginia [8], Vehicle tests were performed at the Japan Automobile Research Institute and Honda Research and Development Americas [6]. Figure 1 : Hybrid III and Thor-Lx features Since its formal release in December of 2000, the Thor- Lx has been tested in many different settings for evaluation and comparison purposes [9-13]. The severity of testing the Thor-Lx has been subjected to ranged from component impact tests to offset frontal vehicle tests. In summary, the Thor-Lx was found to produce more biofidelic results than other dummy lower extremities and performed repeatably and reliably. Other small design changes have been made since its original introduction for improved manufacturability and ease of use, and a 5th percentile female version has been introduced as well, the Thor-FLx/Hlllr [14]. A recent study by Kuppa et al. [10], involving offset barrier vehicle tests, highlighted response differences between the two dummy limbs. Both Thor-Lx and Hybrid III legs proved to be durable in the vehicle tests, and the Thor-Lx calibration responses were unchanged before and after the tests. However, only four tests were performed with each type of leg, and each test was in a different type of vehicle, precluding a thorough assessment of test-to-test repeatability [10]. Inherent variability in vehicle testing prohibited as convincing of a comparison between dummy leg types as would be possible in a sled test setting. This study's objective was to subject the Thor-Lx to a rigorous set of controlled tests to evaluate its response relative to the Hybrid III leg. The sled test environment ensured excellent test-to-test repeatability for each set of tests. A sled-mounted intrusion system created a severe test environment capable of exercising the dummy legs to their design limits. The design of the tests allowed evaluation of repeatability, durability and response comparison of the Thor-Lx and Hybrid III. METHODS Twenty (20) sled tests were performed at the Automobile Safety Laboratory of the University of Virginia Center for Applied Biomechanics. Three to four replicate tests were conducted for each of six test conditions. Test parameters that were varied included leg type (Thor-Lx or Hill), crash pulse, and toepan intrusion (Table 1). Both leg types were mounted on the same pair of Hybrid III knees and femurs, which were fixed to the same Hybrid III 50th percentile male upper body. The knee included a stock ball-bearing slider assembly which allowed posterior translation of the leg relative to the knee joint without binding.

The toepan translated rearward approximately 16 cm without rotation. The angle of the toepan was 53 degrees with respect to the horizontal. c) 56 km/h 1998 Dodge Neon offset frontal vehicle pulse. The toepan translated rearward approximately 16 cm and simultaneously rotated 32 degrees about the y-axis (perpendicular to the sled direction of travel). The crash pulse for the fixed toepan condition simulated a 56 km/h 1997 Ford Taurus full frontal vehicle pulse (Figure 2). The Taurus pulse was selected to represent a full frontal impact, which usually involves little intrusion. This test condition was chosen primarily to evaluate upper-body responses [15]. The crash pulse for the intruding toepan conditions simulated a 56 km/h 1998 Dodge Neon offset frontal vehicle pulse (Figure 2). The Neon offset test produced significant toepan intrusion, a challenging environment chosen to evaluate leg durability and repeatability while highlighting the differences in response of the two designs. Intrusion timing and peak toepan acceleration levels were based on vehicle test data. The amount of translation and/or rotation was chosen to be close to that found in the vehicle tests while exercising the dummy ankles to their design limit. 86</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2: Sled pulses [CFC 60], toepan pulses and toepan displacements [CFC 180] EQUIPMENT - The tests were conducted on the UVA deceleration sled (Via Systems, Model 713). The test fixture, or "buck", utilized in this test series approximated the passenger compartment of a 1993 model year Ford Taurus. An adjustable knee bolster device was used to simulate the energy-absorbing characteristics of production knee bolster and dash assemblies. Cylinders filled with aluminum honeycomb provided a repeatable constant stroking force (310 kPa crush strength, 2.5 kN theoretical crush force per knee) for the padded knee- contact surfaces. The seat was a production bucket seat equipped with an anti-submarining pan integral with the bottom cushion frame. The cushion frame and the anti-submarining pan were reinforced to allow multiple uses while ensuring repeatable subject responses. The restraints used for the tests included a standard three- point belt system manufactured for the 1993 Taurus. A depowered, tethered driver-side airbag (1998 Taurus) was deployed 13 ms after the initiation of the impact event (T0). The intrusion simulator, described in detail by Shaw et al. [15] and Rudd et al. [13] consisted of a ground- mounted decelerator at the impact end of the sled track 87</page><page sequence="4">and a toepan carriage system mounted to the buck (Figure 3). The toepan was designed to displace relative to the occupant compartment, thus simulating intrusion found in some vehicle crashes. Figure 3: Intrusion system Translation-only tests were performed with the toepan rigidly fixed to the intrusion carriage, which produced 16 cm of translation at a peak deceleration of approximately 65 g's without rotation (Figure 2). Translation-rotation tests used the same decelerator/carriage system, but the toepan articulated with a sled-mounted cam to provide the y-axis rotation about a hinge fixed to the carriage. As the carriage translated relative to the sled, the cam profile caused the toepan to rotate toward the occupant. For the translation-rotation tests presented in this paper, the toepan rotated two degrees per centimeter of translation, for a total of 32° over 16 cm with a peak toepan deceleration of around 93 g's (Figure 2). POSITIONING - Positioning for the dummy approximated that reported for 1993 NCAP Taurus frontal barrier tests with the seat in the mid-track position. In most of the tests, the feet were placed flat on the toepan. In the translation tests, the forefeet were elevated on a 3.4 cm high rigid spacer. Without the spacer and with the feet resting on the toepan, the Thor- Lx ankle potentiometer recorded approximately 16 degrees of plantarflexion. With the spacer, approximately one degree of dorsiflexion was recorded in the pre-test position (Figure 4). Placing the ankle in the neutral position pre-test was useful in producing desired peak ankle rotation during the intrusion event. Hybrid III leg pre-test ankle position was similar to that of the Thor-Lx. A special positioning fixture was used to reduce test-to-test variability [15]. Coefficients of variation in initial position values were small (Table 2), and were within standard acceptable limits for automotive testing [16-19], Table 2: Initial position measurements H-point Relative to I Left Knee Distance Right Knee I ! ^ _.. . ~ ~ . c Buck3 Ü Distance b Le» ^ _..

Segment trajectories were later determined by tracking photo targets and key landmarks (Motion Analysis Video Maker - Concurrent Processing, Inc.). Sled deceleration, toepan accelerations and toepan displacement (and rotation) were measured for all of the tests. Uniaxial femur load cells and knee sliders were used for both leg types. Measurement capabilities in the legs differed between the Hybrid lll/Denton leg and the Thor-Lx. Both legs measured proximal tibia Fx, Fz, Mx and My, and distal tibia Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx and My.

The Thor-Lx included a triaxial accelerometer at the midfoot and X- and y-axis accelerometers at the tibia mid-shaft. Electronic data were acquired at 10,000 Hz. Raw force and acceleration data were processed by subtracting small initial offset values and filtering to SAE J211- prescribed filter classes. The data were reported in accordance with the SAE coordinate system (positive axes: x forward, y to the right, z down) (Figure 5). DATA ANALYSIS - Existing and proposed injury measures were calculated using lower extremity instrument measurements. Ankle flexion moments were calculated using distal tibia load cell values and tibia accelerations (when available) as shown in Figure 6 and Equations 1 and 2. Distances and masses used in the calculation are in Table 3. The standard Tibia Index formulation was used for both leg types [20], but the Thor-Lx calculation used modified critical values [1], A summary of the applicable injury criteria is shown in Table 4. Kuppa et al. presented injury thresholds for 25% risk and 50% risk of moderate to severe (AIS 2+) injury. The knee ligament and ankle/malleolus limits are 50% risk values, while the others are 25% risk values [1 , 10].

Comparison of responses involved both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Time history graphs of movement, calculated values and instrument data were constructed using corridors created from Hill leg test results, assumed to represent an "industry standard" response. Averaging the Hill leg test data and then calculating plus and minus one standard deviation of the data at each time step defined the corridor bounds.

This allowed qualitative comparison of the responses over the entire impact event. RESULTS The occupant and test hardware, including the two sets of lower extremities, performed consistently throughout the test series. There was little variation in the change of velocity due to impact (AV) (55.4 - 56.1 km/h) and the peak sled deceleration (26-27 g for the fixed toepan tests and 27-28 g for the intruding toepan tests). Intrusion system pulses were also similar, even though initial acceleration spikes showed some variability (Figure 2). A numerical summary of some of the key responses is shown in Table 5. Time-history curves for some of the sensor and calculated data are shown in Figure 7. Corridors (shaded region) have been constructed by averaging the responses in the Hybrid III tests and filling the area between plus/minus one standard deviation. Individual curves plotted on top correspond to the measurements from the Thor-Lx tests. Ankle moments were calculated according to Equation 1 for Thor-Lx and Equation 2 for Hybrid III. The lack of acceleration data for the Hybrid III precluded inclusion of the inertia! component in Equation 2. Figure 8 shows film analysis results for points relative to their position at T0. Tibia-foot angle results do not represent the actual ankle flexion angle, but show the change in angle between the two segments as a function of time. 90</page><page sequence="7">Figure 7: Lower limb response time-histories: the Hybrid III leg results are plotted as an average ± one standard deviation shaded corridor, and the individual Thor-Lx tests are plotted as tines 91</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7 (continued): Lower limb response time-histories: the Hybrid III leg results are plotted as an average ± one standard deviation shaded corridor, and the individual Thor-Lx tests are plotted as lines Figure 8: Motion analysis time-histories: the Hybrid III leg results are plotted as an average ± one standard deviation shaded corridor, and the individual Thor-Lx tests are plotted as lines DISCUSSION Both sets of dummy limbs were subjected to identical series of severe sled tests without any equipment failures. The translation-only tests created ankle rotations near their limits in dorsiflexion, while the translation-rotation tests caused both ankle types to reach their limits. Pre- and post-test calibration responses did not change for the Thor-Lx. 92</page><page sequence="9">COMPARISON OF THOR-LX AND HYBRID III - In general, the lower extremity kinematics were similar for the Thor-Lx and Hybrid III legs. Because of the coupling with the toepan, ankle rotations were nearly identical despite major design differences between the two. The Hybrid III knee experienced slightly greater forward excursion than the Thor-Lx in the fixed toepan tests. Interaction with the knee bolster was found to be different between leg types [15], likely due to differences in anterior tibia geometry. The greater forward excursion of the Hybrid III knee can also be seen in the peak knee slider translation values, which were generally higher for the Hybrid III than the Thor-Lx. Since the knee slider assemblies were identical, the differences can again be attributed to the anterior tibia and knee geometry of the two leg types. Differences in the intrusion tests were smaller because the intrusion forced the knees up and towards the occupant, allowing for less bolster contact, thus reducing the potential for response variation from leg geometry against the knee bolster. Other studies have found that knee bolster interaction is highly dependent on many factors in tests with toepan intrusion [13]. The stiff sled pulse in the fixed toepan tests resulted in initial Hybrid III tibia axial loads exceeding those of the Thor-Lx. Both leg types produced similar responses later in the event. Several researchers have claimed that the Hybrid III leg is more stiff in axial loading than the Thor-Lx, explaining this difference under rapidly increasing loading [8]. The magnitudes of the axial loads at the initial rise in sled deceleration were similar to those seen at the onset of intrusion in the translation- only and translation-rotation tests. At the onset of intrusion in the translation-only and translation-rotation tests, the Thor-Lx produced higher distal tibia axial load peaks than the Hybrid III. The differences in initial peak response were opposite that seen in the fixed toepan tests, and contrary to published claims that the Hybrid III is stiffer than the Thor-Lx [8]. The reason for this difference was likely because of the alignment of the tibia load cell z-axis in the Hybrid III being canted from the tibia z-axis (as defined by knee center to ankle center). The forward excursion of the dummy prior to intrusion onset changed the tibia angle such that the principal direction of force was more in line with the Thor-Lx tibia shaft than the Hybrid III tibia shaft. The loading was directed more along the load cell z-axis in the Thor-Lx, while the steeper inclination of the Hybrid III tibia resulted in more shear loading. The lack of tibia accelerations for the Hybrid III prohibited thorough analysis, but comparison of accelerometer data would likely confirm this phenomenon. After the initial inertial response, the toepan intruded and forced the foot into dorsiflexion, creating superimposed distal tibia axial load from the Achilles tendon in the Thor-Lx. The extreme amounts of dorsiflexion exercised the Achilles tendon complex to its limits, which resulted in several kilonewtons of axial load in the distal tibia load cell of the Thor-Lx, which was not present in the Hybrid III. The limited amount of ankle dorsiflexion in the fixed toepan tests did not create large moments for either leg type. With intrusion, however, the differences in ankle design were more distinct. Translation-only tests produced dorsiflexion angles of 36° to 38° in the Thor-Lx (Table 5), which, based on film analysis (Figure 8), were similar to flexion angles for the Hybrid III. The right ankle moment response was not very different for the two leg types, since the amount of dorsiflexion was below the engagement point for the Hybrid III joint stop. The left ankle was driven further, however, which resulted in the Hybrid III contacting the joint stop such that large moments were created. This major difference in left/right ankle response highlights the sensitivity of the Hybrid III ankle at the discontinuity of the joint stop. Dorsiflexion angles in the translation-rotation tests were greater (43° to 46°), and the differences in ankle joint design were more noticeable. For the Hybrid III, increasing rotation by a few degrees near the limits causes very large increases in ankle moment due to the discontinuous joint stop design. In the Thor-Lx, the contribution of the internal and external joint stops results in more gradual increases in moment at the limits. INJURY PREDICTION - Due to the vastly different construction, a new set of injury criteria was developed for the Thor-Lx [1], Comparison of the dummy responses relative to their respective lARVs yields a more appropriate evaluation of test severity than considering sensor values alone. Neither leg type exceeded any lARVs for the fixed toepan tests, although the left Hybrid III leg had high knee slider translations (average 90% of IARV), which were likely the result of different anterior tibia geometry and the altered bolster interaction. For the translation-only tests, the Hybrid III produced left lower Tibia Indices that were near the IARV (average 86%). In the same test condition, the Thor-Lx produced ankle responses which exceeded their lARVs. Both left and right ankles exceeded 35° of dorsiflexion, and the corresponding y-axis ankle moments were above the 60 N-m threshold. Both leg types exceeded lARVs for the translation- rotation test condition because of the extreme rotation at the ankle joint. The Thor-Lx recorded rotations in excess of 40° of dorsiflexion, which exceeded the proposed 35° IARV. The corresponding moments were also higher than the 60 N-m threshold, with 148 N-m and 112 N-m calculated at the left and right ankles, respectively. Although the Hybrid III ankle moments were near 300 N-m, no ankle moment criterion exists for this design. The average calculated lower Tibia Indices were 1.16 and 1.13 for the left and right Hybrid III legs, respectively (Figure 9). Revised Tibia Index calculations for the Thor-Lx did not exceed the proposed threshold levels at any location in the translation-rotation tests. 93</page><page sequence="10">Figure 9: Tibia Index (Hlll/Denton - lighter column on left of pair) and Revised Tibia Index (Thor-Lx/Hlllr- darker column on right of pair) averages shown with ± one standard deviation error bars and lARVs Figure 10: Left distal Tibia Index and Revised Tibia Index components (solid represents axial load contribution and hatched represents moment contribution) The high moments from ankle lock-up in the Hybrid III intrusion tests caused lower Tibia Indices to be dominated by the moment contribution (Figure 10). Another factor contributing to the minimal effects from axial load is the 35.9 kN axial force critical value. The reformulated critical values for the Thor-Lx Revised Tibia Index gave axial load and resultant moment more equal contributions in the final calculation. REPEATABILITY OF DUMMY RESPONSE VARIABLES - Although the total number of tests in each condition was small, the coefficients of variation for most responses were low, indicating repeatable responses [16-19], Qualitative analysis of the plots in Figure 7 also show the repeatability of responses with narrow Hybrid III corridors and tight curves for the Thor-Lx tests. A few of the coefficients of variation exceeded ten percent, but the differences were a result of input differences and not dummy variability. 94</page><page sequence="11">Referring to the values in Table 5 for the fixed toepan tests, the variation in Hybrid III left knee displacement was due to signal clipping in one test because of improper instrument settings. The Thor-Lx right knee variation appeared high when calculated as a CV, but only because the average value was low. The Hybrid III translation-only tests exercised the left ankle joint to its soft bumper. Slight variations in rotation at this point resulted in large variations in moment due to the nature of the joint design. The variation in ankle moment was reflected in the left lower Tibia Index by the left lower tibia y-axis moment. Although the Thor-Lx translation-only tests produced more signals with coefficients of variation above ten percent, most of the variation was due to the restraint condition on the right side. The right knee slider CV was 87%, but the average value was 1 mm, which was only 7% of the IARV. Because of the intersection of the lap and shoulder belt at the right hip, the right knee encountered less substantial contact with the knee bolster, which introduced variability in the right leg response. One translation-only Thor-Lx test appeared to have more significant right knee contact with the steering wheel hub, reducing axial loads in the tibia later in the test as the femur load increased. This interaction led to lower ankle rotation as well, which affected the right ankle moment and distal tibia superimposed Achilles load. Right upper and lower tibia axial loads, right ankle y-axis moment, and right upper and lower Revised Tibia Indices all had coefficients of variation greater than ten percent as a result of the different behavior in one test. The Hybrid III ankle y-axis moment response in the translation-rotation tests had high variability due to the discontinuous nature of the joint stop at its limit of rotation, which was reached in all of the tests. The right ankle moment ranged from 242 N-m to 368 N-m, which produced a CV of 18%. A slightly different left knee-to- bolster interaction in one test caused the left upper Tibia Index to vary such that the coefficient of variation exceeded ten percent. Although not as severe as the Hybrid III design, Thor-Lx ankle response at its rotational limits exhibits a more sensitive moment-angle response, which produced high coefficients of variation in the translation-rotation tests as well. The left Thor-Lx ankle dorsiflexion ranged from 42.4° to 44.2°, and the moment ranged from 109 N-m to 185 N-m. That variation also produced higher CVs for the left lower Revised Tibia Index. The left upper Revised Tibia Index variability was created by a late peak in upper tibia response likely from contact with the steering wheel hub. One interesting finding in the Thor-Lx translation-rotation tests was that the right ankle recorded more dorsiflexion than the left, but the left ankle moments were higher. This was likely due to an error while zeroing the ankle potentiometers, which resulted in a small bias for one of the ankles. A potentiometer zeroing fixture became available later in the series before the translation-only tests were conducted. CONCLUSIONS The low test-to-test variability of the sled environment allowed for effective comparison of dummy repeatability, which was shown to be comparable for both leg types. A prior publication [15] demonstrated the effects of leg type on the upper body responses, and it was found that the inclusion of the Thor-Lx did not compromise upper body response or repeatability. While the Hybrid lll/Denton lower extremity and Thor-Lx/Hlllr design both performed well throughout the test series, the increased measurement capability combined with updated injury risk measures allowed the Thor-Lx to give a more thorough and accurate assessment of injury risk. The results suggest the following points: • Durability was not a concern with either leg design. Both legs were subjected to a number of severe intrusion tests, and neither type sustained any damage. The Thor-Lx legs produced acceptable results in the pre- and post-test calibration tests. • Increased biofidelity and measurement capabilities of the Thor-Lx were not associated with increased difficulty of use despite more intricate design and increased instrumentation. The only area of concern was the potentiometer zeroing procedure, which was remedied with a special fixture. • Based on the increased number of injury measures exceeding their lARVs for each test condition, the Thor-Lx gave more conservative assessment of injury risk. • The Thor-Lx continuous ankle joint-stop design provided more human-like results than the Hybrid III. • Newly developed lARVs [1] provide meaningful interpretation of the Thor-Lx instrument measurements. • The Thor-Lx should be modified to include tibia z- axis acceleration and Achilles tension measurements.
