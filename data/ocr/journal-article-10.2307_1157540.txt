<plain_text><page sequence="1">AFRICA JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AFRICAN INSTITUTE VOLUME XXXII JULY I962 NUMBER 3 THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW: AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION ROBIN HORTON INTRODUCTION THE Kalabari people live in twenty-two villages and three small towns in the tidal mangrove swamps of the eastern Niger Delta. Linguistically, they are part of the great bloc of Ijo-speaking peoples who fill the Delta; but they form a distinct sub- group both in dialect and in culture. The traditional economy of most of these com- munities is based on fishing, with surplus fish exported to the hinterland markets and vegetables brought down on the return trip. Over a long period, contact with the hinterland markets seems to have been more frequent than contact between any one village and its Kalabari neighbours; and as a result of this isolation, each village tended to develop certain distinctive variants of fishing technique and of culture generally. Although the general economic pattern was one of fishing, one commu- nity with a fortunate geographical position at the mouth of the Rio Real abandoned this occupation about 400 years ago for trade with European merchants, first in slaves and later in palm-oil brought down from the hinterland. Today, however, this trade has collapsed; and the descendants of those who developed it have largely returned to fishing and fish-trading. The traditional Kalabari fishing-village is built on a raised area of mud in the swamps, often surrounded on all sides by water. It is a compact mass of mangrove- pole-and-thatch houses built round a central arena used for assemblies, religious rites, and recreation. Population varies from 200 to 1,5oo. The basic units of the village are a variable number of lineages, often of markedly unequal size. Each lineage is organized on the basis of a dual system of marriage, whereby a high-bridewealth union ties its offspring to the father's group, and a low-bridewealth union ties them to the mother's group. A man thus traces descent from his lineage founder through a line of mixed male and female links-a line whose exact composition depends on the marriage history of his forebears. Each lineage is a land-holding, land-allocating, and settle- ment unit. Each has an elected head who settles minor internal disputes in council with the adult males of the group, but who does not as a rule represent the lineage to 'Africa', the Journal of the International African Institute, is published by the Institute, but except where otherwise stated the writers of the articles are responsible for the opinions expressed. o</page><page sequence="2">THE KALABARI WORLD VIEW the wider community. Fellow lineage members are bound by strongly felt obligations of mutual aid, which are seen as flowing from their kinship. Village unity is conceived in terms of values strongly contrasted with those that underpin the lineage. The apical ancestors of the community's various lineages are generally seen as unrelated figures, and are often thought to have converged on the present site from a number of different earlier settlements. Diverse in ancestry, the village sees its organization as based on territorial isolation from its neighbours, on political autonomy under a distinctive body of' village laws ', and above all on its own distinctive version of the regional culture and the regional productive skills. Traditional government at village level reflects this contrast between village and lineage ideology: for although the amanyanabo or village head is recruited to office from a particular lineage (often one said to have played a crucial part in founding the community), other lineages are seldom represented as such in the village assembly. Instead, the assembly is organized around two or sometimes three adult male age- grades, with the amanyanabo presiding but not usually initiating decisions. It has both judicial and policy-making functions, and deals with all village matters except for minor affairs arising within particular lineages. Acquisition of influence in the assembly is one of the chief preoccupations of the male villager's life; and he seeks this influence by trying to combine the support of his lineage members with that of his age-mates. Owoame or New Calabar, the community that turned from fishing to the European trade, was sited a few miles from the mouth of one of the largest estuaries in the Delta. As a result of the switch in economy, its social organization developed con- siderable contrasts with that of the villages who kept to fishing. From the loosely knit lineage of fishermen, there developed the New Calabar ' House '-a close-knit trading corporation and war-canoe team whose elected head had a high degree of control over its internal affairs. This house head was chosen above all for his abilities in trade and war, and might be quite a young man. He and the traders under him were constantly buying slaves for incorporation into the ' House ', whose power in the community he aimed to increase thereby. To ensure their smooth integration in the ' House ', the incorporated slaves and their descendants were given fictional kinship ties to the buyers and their descendants: hence, despite its actual composition, this new type of unit was still thought of in lineage terms. At community level, government was carried on not by an assembly of the entire adult male population, but by house-heads and amanyanabo only; and this contrast with the village system reflects a concentration of power into the hands of the limited number of people who controlled the coastal trade. Like the house heads, the Amanyanabo exercised very much more real power than his village counterpart, and was buttressed in this by his monopoly of the ' comey ' protection money payable to him by all European merchants before they opened trade. In these respects, the city-state of New Calabar had a rather different kind of political system from the fishing villages. Nevertheless, a great deal of the old baseline culture survived its economic revolution. Ideas about the nature of the community remained the same; and the contrast between community values and lineage values persisted. The individual's place in society was still seen in much the same terms. Trade was almost as subject to the natural hazards of sea and creek as fishing had been; and as with fishing, the ultimate source of its fruits was the sea. Hence the I98</page><page sequence="3">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION conception of people's relation to their environment changed but little. As a reflection of these important continuities, the broad view of the world supplied by religion remained unchanged in all essentials. MEN AND THE SPIRITS The world in which Kalabari people find themselves has four great levels. The first and most immediate of these is tomi kiri-literally, ' the place of people '. Tomi iri includes all visible and tangible objects, whether human, animal, vegetable, or inert; and the greater part of the average man's experience is of events occurring on this level. Sharply contrasted with things in tomi kiri are those which exist in teme. Teme is a term which can denote either a special mode of being, or an entity existing in that mode. Thus if one asks what sort of people the ancestors are, one will be told that they live and work in teme. And on the other hand, a sick person may be described as being worried by a bad teme. Here I shall translate teme by 'spirit', since this seems to do justice to both senses of the term. Spirits are normally invisible and intangible. True, diviners can go through a series of rites which ' clear their eyes ' so that they can see spirits at will. And these beings sometimes materialize in order to draw men's attention to their wants. But so far as the ordinary person is concerned, they remain by and large ' behind' the visible world, in which they are known only by their effects. Spirits are sometimes talked of as being in certain places. They can be ' in ' objects, people, or shrines. They can 'walk with' people who have special ties with them. And so on. Such talk, however, is to be taken in a very qualified way. Thus, in common with other spirits, those of the dead are sometimes talked of as being in the sky. And on other occasions they are said to be in the burial ground. Yet if one asks whether they move from one place to the other, this is treated as a ridiculous and inappropriate question.' Do spirits have only one place? 'it is asked.' No, they are like the breeze. They are here. And they are also there. No one can say exactly where they are.' In other words, although the activity of spirits can be focused at definite points in the world, they are not present at these points in the same unambiguous sense as would apply to material objects. To Kalabari there is nothing contradictory in assigning them to several places at the same time. Spirits have widely varying relations with the visible, tangible world. First of all, every person, plant, animal, and thing has its own particular spirit, which is in close and continuous association with it, and is sometimes even said to be 'in' it. The relation between a thing and its spirit is often compared to the relation between a canoe and its steersman; for it is the spirit that controls and directs the thing's behaviour. At times, human beings appear to be an exception to this rule; for they often struggle for ends that their spirit is set against. But this freedom is illusory; for in the long run, no desire can be fulfilled unless it is a desire backed by the spirit.I As for other things in the material world, their behaviour is completely governed by their spirits. It is by the joining of a spirit to a material body that all things are created; and it is by the separation of spirit from body that they are destroyed. A person who I For more information on Kalabari ideas of the relation between a man and his spirit, see Horton, 1961. 199</page><page sequence="4">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW dies, a pot that is smashed, a penis that will not stand up, and a coin that will no longer make its owner a profit-all are described by the same term, fite; for the essence of what has happened to all of them is that their spirits have separated from their bodies. Alongside the spirits of particular people and things are three great categories of spirits which lack their close and permanent material associations. In general, these free spirits are more powerful than the fixed kind, though it is through the latter that they influence the material world. The first of these categories is that of duen-the ancestors. Ancestors are in fact the spirits of once-living people that have parted from their bodies at death, and they are thought of as pursuing desires and values similar to those they pursued in life. They look after the welfare of their lineage descendants, and in return expect to be looked after themselves. They reward those who enhance the strength of the lineage by observing kinship norms, and they punish those who spoil the lineage by infringing such norms. The deceased heads of a lineage are of particular importance in this context. They are said to be in a very intimate relation with the living lineage head, who presides over the lineage ' in their name ' and ' with their strength '. In so far as the living head acts well, it is with their guidance. In so far as he acts badly, they have separated themselves from him and sooner or later will punish him. Wherever the rise and fall of' Houses' or lineages is being discussed, the ancestors and their activities are likely to be brought in by way of explanation. The second category of free spirits is that of am'oru-village heroes. Like the ancestors the heroes once lived with men in their communities. But there are some important differences. Myths of the heroes seldom talk of them as having been born and brought up in the village that gives them cult. Sometimes they are said to have come from a distant, non-Kalabari community, or from some unknown place. Often they are said to have come from among the water people to live with men, or to have come from the sea. When the heroes came to live in their chosen villages, they did not just abide by the established customs. Rather, they introduced new laws and new ways of life; and today each village traces those of its laws and institutions which are crucial to its identity to its various heroes. Thus in New Calabar Owamekaso, head of the heroes, introduced the trade with Europe; Okpolodo and Siriopubo introduced head-hunting; Ekineba introduced masquerade dancing; and Amakarasa brought communal purification rites. Finally, instead of dying like the ancestors, the heroes disappeared into the sky or into the ground. They were not buried, and they left no descendants behind them. Since their disappearance the heroes have existed 'in spirit'. Where the ancestors control the fortunes of their several lineages, the heroes control those of the village as a whole. In return for worship they strengthen the village and help it to survive in competition with its neighbours. In particular each hero is responsible for the laws and institutions he or she founded. Each rewards those who enhance village strength by keeping his laws, and punishes those who weaken it by defying such laws. As the ancestral heads of lineages are believed to be in close contact with the present-day heads, so the heroes are in close contact with the village head. If he plays his part well they help him and increase his authority; but if he 'spoils his seat' they may punish and even kill him. In New Calabar old men are fond of remembering how the favour of Owamekaso made the nineteenth-century King Abbi indestructible when 200</page><page sequence="5">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION he led the state's canoe fleet into battle. One very ancient chief told me how as a child he saw Abbi go down to his canoe before the last great river battle of the nineteenth century. Before embarking the king went into Owamekaso's house to offer a libation; and as he went down to the waterside he trembled violently, for 'the power of Owamekaso was with him '. Of an earlier king whose violent and greedy reign had lasted only a few years, people said: ' The way he was spoiling the town, the heroes could not allow him to live long.' The third category of free spirits is that of owuamapu-the water people. These have never lived in villages with human beings; and they are sometimes said to have fabulous towns of their own under the water, where everyone walks decked in coral, gold, and the rarest of cloths. But although myths often portray the life of these towns in strongly anthropomorphic terms, the water people are equally thought of as being like pythons; and they can materialize to men either in human guise, as pythons, or as rainbows. The content of their praise-songs often brings out this polymorphism in a striking way. Thus in a song for one of the most powerful water people, the first stanza refers to the way he travels around the creeks disguised as a poor fisherman dressed in an old thatch hat, the second praises 'the wonder of his twisting coils ', and the third pictures him carrying a spear. Originally all the water people came from the sea; and at certain times of every year they are said to return there to get new strength from owu iyingi-Mother of the Water People. Unlike the ancestors and heroes, the water people are identified not with particular human groups, but with particular tracts of creek, swamp, and mudflat. This contrast is strikingly displayed in the arrangement of shrines; for while the shrines of ancestors and heroes are always in the villages that give them cult, those of the water people are generally perched on raised lumps of mud beside their creek domains. The water people are supposed to have actually made the various delta waterways; and when the ends of rainbows are seen disappearing into the mangrove forests, people sometimes say that they are at work making new creeks. Their activity is supposed to keep the waterways open; and if they should leave their domains these will silt up and eventually dry out. Most important of all, the water people control the weather and the abundance of fish in their creeks. A second field of action for these spirits is that of human behaviour which deviates either above or below social norms. On the positive side, water people are associated with contemporary invention and creation; for people who introduce new dances, drum rhythms, dresses, and women's hairstyles are often said to be relatives of water people or even incarnations of them. At this point one is reminded of the myths of village heroes who came out of the land of the water people. Assessed against beliefs about contemporary innovation, these myths suggest an interesting possibility; which is that formerly, whenever an innovation ' caught on' to the extent of becoming one of the definitive traits of a community's culture, the water man responsible for it may well have been promoted to hero status. I hope to discuss evidence that this may actually have happened in a future paper. Another form of positive deviation from the norm also associated with water people is the possession of great wealth or power. Again, people who have either may be looked on as water men's incarnations or proteges. Great wealth or power, of course, can be looked on as ill-gotten gain rather than 20I</page><page sequence="6">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW as happy fortune; and those who have become strong and rich at the expense of relatives or fellow townsmen may equally have their shady success attributed to the water people. Another form of negative deviation involving these spirits is that of failure to live up to the responsibilities of one's station as husband, father, brother. Finally, the occasional idiots or morons, like the creative innovators, are often believed to be incarnations of water people. Between control over nature and control over human activities that depart from social norms, there seems a fairly evident link. For both nature and deviant activities are in a sense external to the established social order maintained by heroes and ancestors. And if we regard the water people as embodying the forces of the extra- social, then the myths of water men who leave their element to become heroes emerge as explanations of how social change can take place-through the transformation of the individual and the deviant into the established norm. Both in myth and in rite, Kalabari think of the three categories of free spirits as working in relation to one another. Relations between heroes and water people feature commonly in myths which recount the shaping of village institutions. Often the head of the heroes only establishes his or her reign over the village after conquer- ing or coming to terms with the local water people. Thus when Owamekaso wished to become ruler of New Calabar, the other heroes insisted that she must first drive out of the town well a terrible creature which was killing everyone who came to draw water there. When she went to the well she found water people in the guise of seven pythons. After much bargaining the head of the water people said that they would all leave the well if Owamekaso would marry him; and when she consented to this all seven pythons dashed from the town, carving out seven creeks as they went. In the village of Teinma, too, the head of the heroes is said to have established her reign only after fighting and coming to terms with a local water man. She sent a crocodile to steal the instruments he used for making bronze bangles; and the water man chased the thief back to his mistress. In his anger he started to threaten her village; but after she had compensated him with the gift of a woman he went away peacefully, leaving her to rule without further trouble. A similar myth comes from the village of Ido, where the head of the heroes entered into a pact with all the local water people that they should never again drown any member of the village going about his business in the creeks.' Relations between ancestors and heroes are also defined in myth. People often talk about the early days of their village, when heroes and men lived together. They say that the heroes left the village because the men and women of those days could not keep their laws and so polluted them. But once separated from men they agreed to go on looking after them in return for worship. Histories of the various individual ancestors are also full of references both to conflict and to co-operation with the vanished heroes. Finally, myths relate ancestors and water people. Once more we see possibilities for both co-operation and conflict. People of olden times went down into the water, made friends with its denizens, and came up again with new plays and dances. At I The sex of the head of the heroes varies from when I deal with it at a later date, I hope to show that village to village. There is not space in this paper to it can be interpreted along the same lines as I use go into the question of the sexing of the gods; but here to clarify other attributes of the gods. 202</page><page sequence="7">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION other times men and water people came into conflict over a woman or a gifted dancer, whom the spirits coveted and tried to carry off. Many of these mythical relations are reflected in rites. A festival for the head of one's village heroes generally includes some recognition of his or her relations with the water people, expressed in a small offering of food and drink. Sometimes these relations are brought out even more dramatically, as in the famous' creek-swimming ' festival organized periodically by the village of Ke. In this festival youths swim out into the river, towing behind them a boat which is said to belong to the head of their heroes. As they tow the boat past the mouths of the various creeks leading away from the village, a masked man standing on the deck pours libations to the water people in the name of the heroes. If everyone returns to the village unharmed this is a sign that all is well between heroes and water people and that fishing will be good. But if someone is drowned or bitten by a shark, this is a sign that the heroes are not exerting their power; and some human shortcoming that has angered them must be tracked down and repaired. Formerly, it seems, most Kalabari villages had an elaborate cycle of festivals in which all three categories of free spirits were entertained in a regular order. Each category had its appropriate place in the cycle and each had to be entertained before anything could be done for the next. Thus in New Calabar the various 'Houses' had to complete the feting of their ancestors before the state festival of Owamekaso could take place; Owamekaso had to be feted before a series of masquerades in honour of the water people could be enacted; the masquerades had to finish before a second festival for Owamekaso and other heroes was laid on; and finally, the latter had to be complete before the whole cycle could start again. During these cycles there was an insistence that only one category of spirits must be feted at a time: for instance, a lineage must not be feting its ancestors at the same time as the village was feting its heroes. In some villages this insistence on separation of the categories goes even further: thus in New Calabar, Teinma, and Krakrama, even the songs of the water people cannot be sung in the village while the cycle is passing through the phase of ancestral and hero festivals. In these cycles, then, we see first an emphasis on the complementary importance for human welfare of all three categories of free spirits, and second a hint of contrast and potential opposition between any one category and the others. Perhaps it would not be going too far beyond Kalabari conceptions if we visualized ancestors, heroes, and water people as forming the corners of a triangle of forces. In this triangle the relations of each category to its neighbours contain elements of opposition as well as of co-operation. Thus by supporting lineages in rivalry against one another, the ancestors can work against the heroes in sapping the strength of the village; but in other contexts, by strengthening their several lineages, they can work with the heroes in contributing to village strength. Again, when they bring up storms, rough water, and sharks, the water people work against the heroes by hampering the exercise of the village's productive skills; but when they produce calm water and an abundance of fish, they work just as powerfully with the heroes. Yet again, by fostering anti-social activity, the water people can work against both heroes and ancestors; or, by supporting creativity and invention, they can enrich village life and so work with them. 203</page><page sequence="8">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW Acting through the spirits of people, animals, plants, and things, this triangle of free spirits is responsible for almost everything that happens in the immediate world of the Kalabari villager. On the other hand, the villager himself can influence the balance of forces in the triangle by means of ritual. Now any spirit which has become an object of ritual is known as oru;x and the most general term for ritual is oru mie-' making oru '. This phrase carries a suggestion of human power over the free spirits which is borne out in many Kalabari sayings. For example, tomi oru beremare-' It is people who make the oru important'; and tomi, ani oru ma-' People, they are the oru '. Explaining such aphorisms, Kalabari com- pare the spirits with men of influence, who are only big so long as their followers follow them, and who become nothing when their followers fade away. Something similar is expressed in the rather surprising proverb oru bala bo,fe bo-' He who heeds the spirits is a dead man '; the gist of which is that the more seriously one takes the spirits, the more power they acquire to punish one for the slightest infringement of their prohibitions. The converse of this appears in agu nsi owi baka kwma, en k'o karare sin, en duko k'o pre ba-' If a spirit becomes too violent, they will tell him the stick he is carved from '. Literally, if a spirit's demands become too burdensome, the whole congregation can join together to destroy its cult objects, and by this unani- mous act of rejection render it powerless to trouble them further.2 Broadly, then, the more people lavish offerings, invocations, and festivals upon any spirit, the more powerful it becomes both to reward and to punish them. And conversely, the less they attend to it, the less powerful it becomes-up to the point at which unanimous rejection results in complete loss of power. Generally, of course, a single man cannot reject a spirit at will; for while he is only one among a congrega- tion of many, it will still have the power to punish him. Nevertheless, people do believe that a man whose own spirit is exceedingly strong can sometimes escape the consequences of flouting the prohibitions of oru, where a man of weak spirit would become sick or die in so doing. This view of man's relation to the free spirits is not surprising, given the belief that every worshipper himself has a spirit which is something of the same order as the object of worship. In the invocation which is the central act of any ritual, a man is said to 'put his spirit upon his words ', and upon this depends their power. As spirit facing spirit, man does not beg for favours from a position of helpless depen- dence; he asks from a position of some strength. BEYOND THE SPIRITS The third and fourth levels of Kalabari reality are as sharply contrasted with the level of spirits as the latter is with the observable world. Our most convenient entry to these higher levels is through concepts relating to the birth, life, and death of the individual. Everyone in the world has his or her tamuno-a personal creator who joined his spirit to his body when the latter was in I The use of the term oru varies according to con- important than any others, the expression used for text. Its more particular use is that of referring to them is not inappropriate for referring to worship the heroes as distinct from ancestors or water people. of the spirits generally. But it may equally be used as above in referring to all 2 These proverbs may also be used to point out three categories of free spirits. Since rites for the the conditional nature of human leadership. heroes are in some ways more spectacular and more 204</page><page sequence="9">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION his mother's womb. This creator keeps him alive by maintaining the bond between body and spirit, and brings his death by allowing the two to separate. Before a person's spirit is joined to his body, it tells his creator how it will live its life on earth-saying whether it will be powerful or weak, rich or poor, violent or peaceful, fruitful or childless. What is thus spoken is known as fiete boye-' speech before coming', or more briefly as so-' destiny'. Once spoken, the words of the speech are seen as forming a personal principle which controls the entire life-course of the spirit once it has entered its body. As we saw earlier, this life-course may be greatly influenced by the spirit's interaction with heroes, ancestors, water people, and the spirits of other human beings. But the concept of destiny covers the whole pattern of this interaction. Thus whatever a particular hero or ancestor may do to a person through his spirit, this is always something that has been willed by his destiny. For example, a person becomes the priest of one of the heroes because it has 'held' him; but at the same time, at the climax of certain rituals, we see the priest standing before the symbols of the hero and crying: 'My destiny gave you to me! ' Wherever there is some very distinctive feature in the broad pattern of a person's life, this feature tends to be identified with his destiny. Thus if a man loses all his money in a canoe accident, a diviner may trace this misfortune to the anger of a particular spirit. If something similar happens a second time, the anger of the same or another spirit may be diagnosed. But if the man goes to a diviner and reveals a whole sequence of money failures, the diviner is more likely to turn to the man's destiny and to the pattern of poverty which it has laid down for its ward. Where this pattern is particularly obvious, the idea of destiny is sometimes used to predict the future course of a person's life, including the future course of his encounters with other spirits. In one case I was told of, a man went to one of the most powerful water people to ask for riches, taking with him a long history of money troubles. The oracle of the spirit said to him: ' Whatever you offer me, I cannot help you; for there is no money in your destiny.' Once a person's destiny has been spoken it remains in the custody of his creator; and sometimes, if it is very unfavourable, a diviner may recommend the owner to approach this being with a request that she change the old destiny for a new one.' Such a request is known as bibi bari-' calling back the mouth'. A person's destiny determines the time and manner of his death; and death itself is always brought about by his creator. Whether a person dies of old age, is killed by a sorcerer, or is struck by one of the free spirits, this could not have happened had his destiny not willed it and his creator brought it about. That is why, whenever a person dies, the funeral drums always beat out the refrain:' His creator has brought him trouble. Creator, greedy one. Kills, kills, but does not bury! ' Although there is no concept of a lineage creator, the concept of destiny recurs at lineage level. Polo teme so-' lineage destiny '-is a being who determines the entire pattern of lineage history, including relations of the living lineage with its ancestors. Where members of a lineage are thought to share some distinctive character trait, for example cunning, introversion, or violence, this too is identified with their lineage destiny. Whenever the lineage makes a collective offering to its ancestors, its I For further details of this procedure, see Horton, 196I. 205</page><page sequence="10">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW head will usually invoke the lineage destiny at some stage of the rite, for it is the latter who ultimately makes possible a successful approach to the spirits. As with the lineage, so with the village. Although there is no concept of a village creator, there is a well-developed concept of ama teme so-' village destiny '. The ama teme so of a village both determines its history and shapes the ' national character' of its inhabitants. Thus the men of New Calabar see themselves as people who are slow to act in a crisis, but who win in the end by meeting superior numbers with intelli- gence, cunning, and bluff. This is at once a distinctive theme of their history, which they can illustrate by many ancient examples, and a pillar of their present character. ' This is how our ama teme so is ', they say in explanation. The idea of the total culture, or ' way of living of the village ', is almost inseparable from that of ama teme so. As we saw earlier, the life-course of a village is greatly influenced by the various heroes who formerly lived in it, and also by neighbouring water people whose action complements that of the heroes. The origin and maintenance of particular village institutions tends to be explained in terms of particular heroes. And the suc- cess of the village's distinctive productive technique is explained in terms of co-opera- tion between neighbouring water people and the head of the heroes. But the character of these heroes and water people, and the nature of their interaction with the village, are themselves explained in terms of ama teme so. All the heroes, for example, are frequently said to be ' things of our ama teme so ', or even to ' be ' ama teme so. An invocation to its ama teme so normally precedes any of the village's approaches to its heroes, for ultimately it is this being that determines their success. The fourth and final level of Kalabari reality is that of tamuno conceived as creator of the entire world. To distinguish this concept from that of the individual's creator, Kalabari generally speak of opu tamuno-' the Great Creator'. There is no elaborate world creation myth in this culture, and the Great Creator is simply said to have formed all things in the world out of mud. She watches over the world, and ultimately nothing can happen in it which she has not willed. Sometimes she is talked of as being 'in the sky', which she also created. Indeed so--the sky-is so closely asso- ciated with her that it is often used as her synonym. Of the two terms, tamuno seems the more appropriate when the original creation of the world is mentioned, while so seems more appropriate when the subject is the behaviour of what has been created. Thus while people speak of tamuno as having created everything in the world, they are apt to say that ' everything that happens comes from so '. In some contexts, then, Tamuno and so refer to the two great roles of a single supreme being; tamuzno being concerned with the origins of things and so with their destiny. Now the tamuno and so of individuals, and the so of lineages and villages, are all aspects of the unitary tamuno and so. In explaining the idea of an individual's creator, Kalabari say' all tamuno are one opu tamuno '. Again, they say 'all ama teme so are one so '. A striking feature of the beliefs about these two pervasive principles is that so is seen as subordinate to tamuno only at the level of the world as a whole and at the level of the individual. At the level of lineage or village, so stands by itself as polo teme so or ama teme so. One old man whom I asked about this said, 'The only tamuno of the village are all the tamuno of the different people who live there.' This remark, I think, Like oru, the term so is one that has to be translated with care, since its meaning varies considerably according to context. 206</page><page sequence="11">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION shows up the logic implicit in the asymmetry. Both the world as a whole and the individuals within it can display their characteristic behaviour only so long as they continue in material existence; and as tamuno assures this existence so, who determines the behaviour of what exists, must be subordinate to her. With social groupings such as lineage and village, however, the situation is rather different. From the point of view of material existence, the group is no more than the sum of its individual members. Its distinctiveness emerges only in its culture, which is something over and above the individual character dispositions of its members. Hence while the group has no collective tamuno over and above the tamuno of its individual members, it must have a collective so. Although, as we have seen, Kalabari perform ritual for those limited aspects of tamuno and so that relate to their immediate world, these principles are never invoked in their unitary guise. Since Kalabari have little need to come to practical terms with the wider cosmos which envelops the delta world, they do not need to approach the beings concerned with this wider cosmos. In Kalabari thought, tamuno, so, and their aspects are beings of a very different sort from the spirits. There are no elaborate myths defining their character, and although they are treated personally, their personality is of a very restricted kind. Thus tamuno is said to be female and one may address one's personal tamuno as 'my tamuno, my mother'. But, unlike the spirits, tamuno has no spouse and no children. As for so, it is neuter. Consistently with all this, tamuno and so have none of the anthropomorphic sculptural representation given to the spirits. Nor, since they are beings of a different order from the human spirit, can they imitate heroes, ancestors, and water people in displacing this spirit from a man's body and so possessing him. Although people approach their individual tamuno and the so of their groups with offerings and requests, these seem to have a very different basis from offerings and requests to the spirits. The traditional offering to one's tamuno is the small abila fish, which Kalabari say' is something that any man can get'. And the traditional offering to one's polo teme so or ama teme so is a simple libation of gin. Here we find none of the large offerings of fowls or goats given to the spirits, nor any idea that the bigger the offering, the more effective the rite. None of the sayings about the power of men over the spirits are ever applied to these higher beings. A village cannot escape from its ama teme so by withdrawing worship from it, nor a man from his tamuno. Such contrasts follow from the place of these higher beings in the total scheme of things. For when the human spirit acts upon one of the free spirits in ritual, it is trying to influence a being that exists alongside itself and is of the same order. But when the same human spirit approaches tamuno or so, it is approaching a being who already determines its fortunes-a being of whose will its every action is a manifesta- tion. Although it can pray to such a being and make offerings in the hope of future happiness and comfort, there is a sense in which it cannot really affect the outcome. And this is what Kalabari mean when in moments of resignation they say of their tamuno, ' The creator never loses a case.' AN INTERPRETATION This account of the Kalabari world-view may seem over-systematized. In a sense, of course, it is. For only a very limited fragment of the beliefs outlined here is ever 207</page><page sequence="12">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW brought into use in any particular eventuality that demands explanation. But the various fragments used in successive situations do overlap and interlock to a considerable degree; and I think this paper is a fair summary of the system which results. At this point, one cannot help stopping to wonder what sort of a belief system we have here. On the face of it, the system is an explanatory one, giving answers to the questions 'Why did this happen? ' and ' What can we do about it? ' But what kind of explanations are these ? Can we grasp their logic by comparison with any form of explanation current in modern Western culture; or is this logic something quite distinct from any we ourselves are familiar with? Twentieth-century social anthropologists dealing with similar belief-systems have tended to answer this sort of question by reacting against their nineteenth-century predecessors Tylor and Frazer, who saw primitive world-views as attempts to provide explanations not very different from those thrown up in our own culture by the activities of scientists. In this reaction, they seem to have been much influenced by the famous French philosopher-sociologist Levy-Bruhl, who opened his classic work on primitive thoughtI by attacking the nineteenth-century ' Ecole anglaise' for their views on this subject. Comparison of primitive patterns of explanation with what he understood to be the paradigm of scientific explanation convinced Levy- Bruhl that there was an enormous gap between the two. He concluded that in primi- tive societies much of their world-view could be called explanatory only in a very stretched sense; and he coined the phrase ' mystical thinking' in order to contrast this primitive material with the 'rational thinking' that found its purest form in Western science. He retained this distinction even in later works which benefited from modern fieldwork data (Levy-Bruhl, I938 and 1949); and in these later works he clearly enumerated what he took to be the salient features of mystical beliefs. Briefly, these salient features were: indifference to considerations of physical impossi- bility, indifference to the opposition between the idea of the one and the idea of the many, and concern with invisible powers and beings whose attributes were bizarre, fluid, and altogether improbable. According to Levy-Bruhl, these distinctive features of mystical belief arose not so much from an attempt to explain happenings in the material world, as from an attempt to objectify certain emotions. Now although anthropologists today may disagree with much of Levy-Bruhl's theoretical framework, most still make his distinction between mystical and rational thought; and, following him, they still tend to treat primitive idea-systems as struc- tures whose logic is very much sui generis. Outside anthropology, Levy-Bruhl's views have been taken even more seriously. Thus philosophers like Cassirer (Cassirer, 1946) and Langer (Langer, 1942), substituting an h for an s, have developed his ideas in elaborate theories of ' mythical thinking '. And a variety of psychologists have followed suit. In fact, however, the gap between idea-systems such as we have just outlined and the explanatory theories thrown up by scientists has been exaggerated by a distorted conception of science itself. For Levy-Bruhl, like many thinkers of his time, seems to have taken his ideas on the subject from positivist philosophy; and in this he has been followed by many anthropologists since. Now the positivists saw the scientist as a man who had succeeded in making his Les Fonctions mentales dans les societes inferieures, Paris, 191o. 208</page><page sequence="13">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION mind a tabula rasa-free from all preconceived hypotheses and beliefs in unobservable entities, receptive only to the inflow of sensory stimulation. From this inflow the scientist laboriously extracted concomitant variations, and recorded his findings in general statements of natural law. If based on a sufficient run of experience, such statements could then be used to predict future events; and predictions of this sort were seen as the principal justification of science. In this picture, of course, there is nothing that has the remotest connexion with the sort of idea-system typified by the Kalabari world-view. So far as we know anything about the origins of systems of its kind, they are the result not of laborious inductions from experience, but of broad visions of forces underlying the observable world; visions which arise in an essentially intuitive fashion. Again, the Kalabari world-view, with its paradoxical, improbably characterized spirits and its many-levelled picture of reality, seems poles apart from any system of generalizations which merely summarizes past experience and predicts the future. No wonder Levy-Bruhl, faced with this type of material, felt he was con- fronted with an entirely distinct mode of thought. Although he spent years documenting the salient features of his' mystical thinking' with material from all corners of the world, Levy-Bruhl never managed to show why the idea-system of a particular society should take the particular form it did. Nor, I think, can we do any better if we apply Levy-Bruhl's ideas to the Kalabari material. So long as we see nothing but a huge gap between' mystical' and' rational' thought, data of this kind are bound to remain unintelligible. Curiously enough, it was Levy-Bruhl's contemporary Durkheim who first saw the really basic fallacy of his ideas, and who showed the way to a more fruitful viewpoint. Durkheim, starting from a more informed conception of the nature of science, pointed out that the supposedly distinctive features of' mystical thinking' were in fact equally characteristic of theoretical thinking in the sciences. He recalled that the aim of science was not only prediction, but also understanding. A theory provided understanding by' unifying consciousness ' and by demonstrating' internal relations' between phenomena: that is, it showed a great diversity of phenomena as manifesta- tions of a single, relatively simple, inner reality. The beliefs referring to this inner reality showed many features typical of Levy-Bruhl's mystical beliefs: thus they dealt with invisible powers whose properties often defied the laws which applied to observable phenomena. But, Durkheim suggested, these paradoxical properties were integral to their explanatory function. For in so far as explanation involved the unification of apparent diversity, explanatory concepts must often override distinc- tions and oppositions regarded as absolute by common sense. This brilliant criticism of Levy-Bruhl is set out in five short pages of Durkheim's classic work on religion (Durkheim, 1915, pp. 234-9). Unfortunately, however, the insights which it expresses do not seem to have been developed any further. Durkheim was addicted to developing many strands of thought, each brilliant in itself, but often inconsistent with the others. In Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, he picked up this particular strand, played with it briefly, then dropped it again in favour of his thesis that the gods were mere symbols of society, and his preoccupation with a sup- posedly universal distinction between the sacred and the profane. These ideas he pursued at far greater length; and they, alas, are the ones which his followers have mostly fastened upon. Given the positivist background of the Radcliffe-Brown era, 209</page><page sequence="14">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW this selection from Durkheim's ideas is hardly surprising. But it is one that has brought little profit to the comparative study of religions. Recent fieldwork has made it clear that the division of the world into things sacred and things profane is by no means a universal feature of human society. And the thesis that the gods are mere symbols of society and social relations has both confused and narrowed the social anthropo- logist's approach to religion. In the present paper, I do not want to go any further in criticizing this aspect of Durkheim's thought: for this is a job that has already been well done by a number of people writing during the last decade (see, for instance, Evans-Pritchard, 1956; Forde, 1958; Goody, 1961; Lienhardt, 1956). Instead, I want to return to Durkheim's insights about the continuity between theoretical thinking in primitive cultures and theoretical thinking in the sciences; for by a development of these I feel we can get a good deal of clarification of the sort of material described in the first part of this paper. Let us start by looking briefly at a concrete example of the growth of a scientific theory.I We could do worse than focus on a man like the physicist Rutherford, puzzling over the passage of fast-travelling small particles through sheets of metal foil in his laboratory. First, we see him grasp intuitively at an analogy between the pattern of his puzzling observations and the behaviour of fast-travelling bodies meeting our planetary system. Then we see him use the planetary system as a model of the reality underlying his laboratory observations. He identifies aspects of his planetary model with aspects of his observations, and from these identifications plus statements about the behaviour of his model, he deduces the observations that originally puzzled him. Over the course of time, Rutherford and others are able to show that a number of apparently diverse observed regularities all become intelligible as manifestations of the supposed behaviour of the model. And postulates about this behaviour also serve to predict new and unsuspected regularities. At this stage we see a gradual acceptance of the model as representing the reality that underlies the diverse conditions of observable matter. People begin to talk of a great advance in understanding the nature of matter. We also see something which is particularly important in the present context; and that is what is known as the 'development' of the model. Once drawn from the planetary system that inspired it, the model is not merely used unchanged, for there are many phenomena which in its raw form it cannot render intelligible. Rather than scrap the model, however, Rutherford's successors modify it progressively by way of concession to the structure perceived in their recalcitrant observations. Thus they introduce the possibility that the 'planets' may make sudden changes of orbit, and in doing so emit or absorb energy. At the centre of the system they substitute a I There are a number of good general accounts of the Sciences (Harre, 1960 and I96I). I have followed the nature of modern science, which illustrate some the last book in taking the Rutherford-Bohr Atom of the points made in what follows.

And, finally, they have to cast doubt on whether any given' planet' can be talked of as having a definite and unambiguous position in the system at a particular moment. When we compare the result of these successive modifications with its prototype in the heavens, we find that it has become a very odd kind of planetary system indeed. It has a nasty, mongrel air about it. And with good reason: for its structure is a hybrid between that of its heavenly prototype and that perceived in the patterns of observation it is called upon to explain.I This sense of the odd and the paradoxical arising from hybrid structure is a feature of many good theoretical models used by scientists; and as I hope to show in a moment, it has important parallels in the sort of prescientific belief system exemplified by the Kalabari material. The planetary model of matter illustrates another point about scientific theorizing which is also important to us. There is a sense in which this model has now super- seded an older one; namely, the model of solid, homogeneous atomic spheres linked through limited numbers of elastic bonds: for it is capable of explaining a far wider range of phenomena than the old model. Nevertheless, the latter remains as useful as ever in explaining a wide variety of chemical phenomena under normal, everyday conditions; and there is a sense in which the newer model has not so much superseded it as reduced it to a subordinate place in a hierarchy of models. The significance of a hierarchical ordering of models often emerges clearly when the findings of scientists are applied to practical life; for in applied science the level of model invoked depends upon the range of phenomena being grappled with. If one operates within a limited range of phenomena, one need only take account of a first-order theoretical model; whereas if one operates within a wider range, it may be necessary to invoke a second-order model of which the first-order one is merely a limited manifestation. Thus a manufacturing chemist making caustic soda out of salt at fairly unspectacular temperatures and pressures will probably need to take account of nothing higher than the first-order model of homogeneous atomic spheres linked by elastic bonds. But a physicist interested in the behaviour of substances over a ten-million-degree temperature range will have to take into account the second- order model of electrons orbiting around heterogeneous nuclei in planetary systems. The scientist's world, then, has several levels of reality. Each level, moreover, has a set of descriptive categories which is particular to itself and inapplicable to other levels. Thus, for the physicist, his world of observation is describable in terms of mass, extension, colour, and temperature. His first-order model of atoms linked into molecules drops colour and temperature from its set of descriptive categories. And his second-order model of planetary systems even drops the category of spatial extension in its ordinary sense. As we ascend from level to level, fewer and fewer of the categories appropriate to the description of observable reality apply; until, as physicists often like to emphasize, their highest-order models are not really material at all. This dematerialization of successive levels of reality is a consequence of one of the basic functions of explanation-that of unifying apparent diversity. Either I For the philosophically minded who may be correspondence I am talking of here is not one reading this paper, I should like to make it clear that between theoretical model and reality, but one be- I hold no brief for a ' mirror theory ' of correspon- tween model and reality-as-verbally-described. dence between language and reality. The structural 2II</page><page sequence="16">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW one explains two sets of properties by showing one as a form of the other (as when the kinetic model of gas behaviour shows heat as a form of motion); or one shows both to be manifestations of a third set of properties which cannot be equated with either of them (as perhaps happens with the properties of matter and the properties of radiation in modern quantum theory).' This sketch of the growth, form, and function of scientific theory turns out to be a most useful tool for grasping the logic behind the more paradoxical attributes of the Kalabari gods. First of all, let us treat the Kalabari world-view as based on a theoretical model whose prototype is Kalabari people; and let us assume that it has developed from this prototype in response to the problems posed by the world as it appears from a delta village. Like those thrown up by scientists, the Kalabari model is designed to give foresight by spelling out the consequences of a variety of actions and happenings, and understanding by showing a great diversity of pheno- mena as manifestations of a limited number of underlying principles related in a fairly simple way. Though by our own standards this model does not in fact produce a high degree of foresight, an intricate web of secondary elaborations for explaining away failure makes it seem to do so. As for understanding through the unification of apparent diversity, we have aready seen how ideas about the action of ancestors, heroes, and water people, and about the influence exerted on them by human spirits, form a relatively simple theoretical scheme in terms of which an enormous variety of observable happenings can be linked together and made intelligible. As I pointed out earlier, this scheme accounts not only for the recurrent events of the delta world, but also for non-recurrent social change through the transformation of the individual and the deviant into the normal and the institutionalized. Now comes a most important point. We have just seen how developed scientific models tend to be structural hybrids, since those who develop them add successive new features to their prototypes by way of concession to the structure they per- ceive in their observations. Some of the more paradoxical features of the gods become intelligible as soon as we see them as products of just this sort of structural hybridization. Let us look again at the three-cornered relation between ancestors, heroes, and water people. On the one hand, all three categories of spirits show many features of ordinary Kalabari people. Their myths tell of relationships, marriages, and quarrels- all very reminiscent of everyday life in the delta. Their relations with human spirits are constantly elucidated by referring back to relations between people in the ob- servable world. And conversely, sayings about the relations between worshippers and their gods are frequently used as proverbs to throw light on purely human relationships. On the other hand, the structure of this triangle of spirits also reflects the structure of the total delta world as seen through Kalabari eyes. It reflects the struggle of people, using the distinctive production techniques of their village, to tame and wrest a living from the reluctant creeks and swamps. It reflects the separa- tion, contrast, and potential opposition between lineage values and village values. x A very clear demonstration of the essential con- pretation of Nature and The Teachings of Goethe and nexion between dematerialization and the explana- Newton on Colour in the Light of Modern Physics (Heisen- tory functions of theory is given by Heisenberg in berg, I952). two essays entitled On the History of the Physical Inter- 212</page><page sequence="17">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION And again, it reflects the ambiguous relation between behaviour which keeps to the established norms, and deviant behaviour-whether creative, anti-social, or merely inadequate. Now the paradoxical attributes of heroes and water people are essential to this reflection, since they define each category of spirits in a way appropriate to its place in the triangle. This is true, for example, of such attributes of the heroes as having left no human descendants, having disappeared instead of undergoing death and burial, and having come from outside the community. All these serve effec- tively to define the heroes as forces quite separate from the ancestors with their kinship involvements. Lack of descendants does this in an obvious way. Disappear- ance rather than death and burial performs the same function, especially when, as in Kalabari, lack of burial is almost synonymous with lack of kin. And arrival from outside the community again makes it clear that they cannot be placed in any lineage or kinship context. These attributes are integral to the definition of the heroes as forces contrasted with and potentially opposed to those embodied in the ancestors. Again, the water people are said to be 'like men, and also like pythons '; and here too the paradoxical characterization is essential to defining their place in the triangle. The python is regarded as the most powerful of all the animals in the creeks, and is often said to be their father. But its power is seen as something very different from that of human beings-something 'fearful' and ' astonishing '. In dances, it is por- trayed by a horizontal slithering motion which contrasts starkly with the rather rigid verticality used to portray human power and dignity. The combination of human and python elements in the characterization of the water people fits the latter per- fectly for their own place in the theory-as forces of the extra-social contrasted with and potentially opposed to those embodied in both heroes and ancestors. To sum up briefly on this point: both the planetary model of the physicist and the personal model of the Kalabari villager are called upon to do a specific explanatory job; and in both cases, the demands of explanation make it necessary to give the model a structure which is hybrid between that of its prototype and that of the observations to which it is applied. Hence, when we measure the two models against their prototypes in the observable world, both show attributes which fit Levy-Bruhl's ' mystical' classification: they are 'indifferent to considerations of physical impos- sibility ', and they are 'bizarre ', ' strange ', and 'improbable '. But in both cases these oddities are essential to their explanatory function. So far, in this section, we have limited our perspective to a first-order explanatory model. But another feature of scientific theory paralleled in the Kalabari world-view is the plurality of levels of reality which it postulates. At the lowest level, we have 'the world of men'; at the next level, the various spirits; at the next, aspects of tamuno and so; and finally, tamuno and so considered as unities. As in a body of scientific theory, each level unifies phenomena which appear disparate at the level below it. Thus particular incidents in a person's life are linked with previous events by the use of ideas about relations between his spirit and one or other of the categories of free spirit. And in turn, a whole sequence of such relations is explained in terms of the individual's so and the key traits which mark it off from the so of others. As in applied science, the level of theoretical model taken into account in any context varies with the range of phenomena with which the user has to grapple. Thus, when some- body is trying to remedy a single piece of misfortune occurring in isolation, he thinks p 2I3</page><page sequence="18">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW in terms of ancestors, heroes, water people, and their propitiation. But when he is trying to cope with this misfortune as the latest element in a whole adverse pattern which has dogged his life, he is more likely to think in terms of his so, and of the possibility of changing it through the agency of his tamuno. The practice of varying one's level of theory with the range of phenomena one is trying to cope with also, perhaps, makes it understandable why the unitary tamuno and so were not actively approached in traditional Kalabari religion. For together they provided some sort of interpretation of the creation and life-course of the world seen as a whole; and though Kalabari were aware of a wider world surrounding their own little enclave, it did not greatly impinge on their activities and they found small cause for coming to terms with it. This view of the matter is supported by subsequent Kalabari readiness to identify their unitary tamuno with the Christian God, and to give it active worship in such a guise. For Christian evangelism coincided with a growing irruption of the wider world outside into the narrow enclave of village life, and hence with a growing need to come to terms with this wider world. A final parallel with the universe of science lies in the fact that each level of Kalabari reality has certain diagnostic attributes which are not shared with the levels above or below it. Thus we have the visible, tangible, spatially extended 'world of men '. Then we have the level of spirits, where all things are invisible, intangible, and have no unambiguous spatial location, although they can possess human bodies and mani- fest their personalities through them. Lastly we have tamuno, so, and their aspects- also invisible, intangible, and without definite spatial location, but in addition unable to manifest themselves through possession as the spirits do. Here too, fewer and fewer of the dimensions of observable reality seem present as we ascend from level to level. As people, the spirits are highly schematized; and when we reach the aspects of tamuno and so, all but a few of the normal dimensions of personality have dis- appeared. As in the domains of science, this progressive dematerialization (or, might one say, ' spiritualization ') seems to be the obverse of the fact that as tools of under- standing, successive levels of Kalabari reality are committed to explaining more and more in terms of less and less. CONCLUSIONS Before summing up, I should like to make it clear that my use of the scientific analogy to illuminate Kalabari thought in no way implies a belief that this thought is itself scientific. On the contrary, from what we know of its functioning, it submits to few of the controls that are essential to science. Thus, for a start, its theories are heavily defended against adverse experience by an intricate web of secondary elabora- tions, in a way that can only be called typically unscientific. Nevertheless, the Kalabari world-view raises a number of key problems which turn out to be more or less identical with some of the tougher puzzles about the status of theory in twentieth-century science. First of all, there is the problem raised by a picture of reality which postulates more than one level of existence. (In what sense can observable things be at once themselves and manifestations of higher-level events other than themselves? In what sense can higher-level events be said to explain those at a lower level?) Again, there is the problem raised by the selection of different levels of reality as the basis of explanation in various contexts. There is the 214</page><page sequence="19">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION problem raised by the fact that entities on the higher levels of reality tend to have attributes which are 'bizarre', 'paradoxical ', and 'improbable' when measured against the yard-stick of the everyday world and its properties. And, finally, there is the problem raised by the progressive disappearance of the various dimensions of the everyday world as we leave it for successively higher levels of theory. Levy- Bruhl and others since his time have taken for granted that such problems are specific to prescientific thought; but a more adequate view of the nature of science suggests that the very opposite is the case. Just how far is the analogy with scientific theory illuminating when applied to other prescientific religious systems in Africa and beyond ? At the moment, this is a difficult question to answer. It is a commonplace that one's selection and ordering of data are deeply influenced by one's theoretical viewpoint. And most anthropological analyses of prescientific religious systems have been conducted from a viewpoint which has little in common with the one advocated here. Hence the latter's range of applicability could be determined only after a long and time-consuming process of disentangling ethnographic data from theoretical framework. Nevertheless, I think it might be relevant to this question to remind readers of a body of work whose approach seems not far removed from the one advocated in this paper. Here I am thinking of the work of what one might call the 'Oxford School'. Studies conducted by this school stand out from many others in their willingness to take primitive religious systems at their face-value: that is, as serious attempts to provide a body of theory which will enable a man to gain understanding of the world around him. Through adopting this viewpoint, the Oxford School has perhaps gone farther than anyone else in demonstrating the rationale that lies behind much of what seems to us irrational. Of the various Oxford-inspired studies, Lienhardt's Divinity and Experience: the Religion of the Dinka (Lienhardt, I96I) seems closest to the present approach.' This book treats the Dinka world-view as a system of theory which attempts to provide a basis for understanding a vast number of observations, about relations between different aspects of society, relations between the established social order and what is external to it, relations between the individual and the group, and so on. Lienhardt lays particular emphasis on the way in which the Dinka gods serve to demonstrate the unity which lies behind the apparent diversity of the observed world. He shows how they form a theoretical model which enables Dinka to see the various eventuali- ties of the world around them as due to the operation of a small number of under- lying principles related in a fairly simple way. Although most of Middleton's Lugbara Religion is written from a somewhat different angle, its closing chapters give a brilliant description of the Lugbara world-view, which again suggests parallels with theory in the sciences. Here we find a theoretical model in which the ancestors, embodying the forces of established social order, are in balanced opposition to the adro spirits which embody the forces of the extra- social. Like the Dinka model, that of the Lugbara highlights the unities that lie Although Lienhardt does not expressly use the too has drawn inspiration from the ' submerged analogy with scientific theory, it was his book that strand' of Durkheim's thought which I mentioned led me to wonder whether it might not be illumi- earlier. nating. His terminology leads one to suspect that he I 5</page><page sequence="20">THTE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW beneath apparent diversity: for it explains the most various oppositions and dichoto- mies in the observable world in terms of a single pervasive relation between under- lying principles (Middleton, 1960, pp. 230-70). If we look at the Lugbara world-view from this angle, we see that the bizarre, inverted features of the adro have an essential part to play in the total scheme of things; for it is these features that define the posi- tion of the adro in the theoretical model-as forces contrasted with and potentially opposed to those embodied in the ancestors. Both the Dinka and the Lugbara studies bring out the multi-levelled character of the world-views they portray. For in both, it emerges clearly that the ancestors and spirits which feature in the first-order theories are thought of in some contexts as manifestations of a single Supreme Being. This multi-levelled character is also strongly emphasized in the book to which both these studies clearly owe inspira- tion: Evans-Pritchard's study of Nuer religion (Evans-Pritchard, 1956). All three of these works treat the Supreme Being in a way which suggests further parallels with the world of science. For, on the one hand, they show the domain of the gods, spirits, and ancestors as a first-order model used to explain the more immediate world of the peoples concerned; whilst on the other hand, they show God and his activities as a second-order model which is brought in to explain those situations where the immediate world has to be seen as part of a wider macrocosm (see, for example, Evans-Pritchard, I956, p. I 8). All three works also emphasize a progressive 'dematerialization' as one passes from the observable world, through the beings of the first-order model, up to the Supreme Being. This is a pervasive theme of Evans- Pritchard's Nuer study. By and large, the line of interpretation taken by the 'Oxford School' seems to have much in common with the line advocated in the present paper. But I believe that explicit use of the scientific analogy would have made it possible for them to have pushed their interpretation yet further. This seems especially true in the matter of 'dematerialization '. Evans-Pritchard has devoted the most attention to this pheno- menon; and if I read his Nuer analysis aright, its assumptions are as follows. Every level of Nuer theory features the concept of Spirit. At the lower levels, the concept is 'refracted' by various aspects of the observable world, and thereby acquires a variety of subsidiary attributes which the anthropologist can interpret by reference to features of Nuer social structure, ecology, and so on. At the highest level, however, we find an ' unrefracted ' idea of Spirit, in which the essence of the concept emerges untrammelled by any subsidiary attributes. About the character of this pure concept, the anthropologist can say nothing. He must take it as a 'given', about which only the theologian can make any further pronouncement. Now if we look at Nuer religion as a system of theory akin to those of modern science, I believe we shall no longer find it necessary to abandon our task at this point. On the contrary, we shall be able to interpret Nuer ' dematerialization' within the same framework of ideas as we have used to interpret other aspects of the system. Briefly, the appropriate interpretation seems to be the same as the one I have applied to my Kalabari data: that is, progressive dematerialization towards a concept of Pure Spirit occurs because successive levels of Nuer theory are committed to explaining more and more in terms of less and less. True enough, the attributes of Nuer Spirit are very different from those of the modern physicist's Ultimate Particles; but this TI6</page><page sequence="21">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION is because the one concept derives from the prototype of people and the other from the prototype of planets. In each case, however, the relation of the theoretical con- cept to its prototype is much the same; and in each case I would hold that the devel- opment of concept from prototype is a response to the same underlying pressure: the search for understanding.' This passing glance at the work of the ' Oxford School' does seem to show that the analogy with scientific theory can throw illumination beyond the particular case of the Kalabari. And on this assumption I should like to end by pointing out three potential merits of the approach I have advocated. First of all, one of the most important differences between scientific and pre- scientific thought is that the former continually reflects upon itself as it goes along, whilst the latter is far less self-conscious (Lienhardt, 1954). In science, this reflection has led to considerable achievements in relating puzzling features of theoretical con- cepts to the function of such concepts in providing explanation of the world and its workings. By applying the scientific analogy to the less self-conscious thought- systems of Africa, such achievements can be used to spotlight relations between theoretical form and theoretical function in places where they were formerly obscure and implicit. A second potential merit lies in the prospect of reconciling the two schools of thought whom we may call ' symbolists ' and 'literalists '. Briefly, the ' symbolists ' maintain that statements about the gods and rites devoted to them are not really what they seem to be: they really refer obliquely to events in the observable world of those who use them, or they ' symbolize' these events. Thus a ' symbolist' might say that the real significance of Kalabari village heroes was that they referred obliquely to village solidarity, or that they provided an alternative way of talking about such solidarity. For the ' literalists ', treating the gods as mere symbols for events in the everyday world denies what we know as a matter of observation-i.e. that for the people who believe in them, they really are there. The ' literalists ' see this approach as obscuring some of the most important facts about the gods. Thus, for their believers, the gods are often forces from which they really do think they can get aid of various sorts; and for at least some people in every society, they are vital social partners in whom a great deal of emotional capital is locked up. Several well-known writers have taken this position in recent years (see, for example, Evans-Pritchard, I956; Goody, I961; Lienhardt, 956). Against the 'literalists ', a powerful body of opinion still remains in favour of using the concept of' symbolization ' when trying to interpret religious statements and rites. Leach and Levi-Strauss remain strong advocates of this approach, and they have many followers. An interesting advocate of the ' symbolist' approach is Firth; for in a recent paper (Firth, I960) he shows himself conscious of the difficulties involved in giving a sense to the concept of' symbol' in contexts where the actor himself is unaware that he is ' symbolizing'. At the same time, he appears to feel that the idea of religious statements and rites as referring to goings-on in the every- I Although this argument may appear to have have the concept of Spirit; but it says nothing about a metaphysical content, it actually has none. It tries the existence or non-existence of an entity corre- to answer the question of why the Nuer come to sponding to this concept. 217</page><page sequence="22">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW day world remains illuminating. For him, it seems an idea necessary to do justice to the element of structural correspondence between religious thought-systems and the everyday worlds of those who hold them. Now the dilemma implicit in Firth's paper would be solved if the analogy with scientific theory proved widely applicable to prescientific thought-systems. For the perception of structural correspondence between an area of puzzling observations and a new model is at the core of one important type of 'scientific discovery' (Harre, 1960 and I96I). Moreover, the scientist can only apply an established theo- retical model to the task of explanation when he knows the 'bridge-statements' which set out correspondences between aspects of the model on the one hand, and aspects of his observations on the other. At the same time, a fruitful theory comes to be accepted not merely as an oblique way of referring to the observations, but as the representation of an order of events which really does underlie them. Hence, in so far as primitive religious systems embody theories comparable to those of science, there is clearly no antithesis between reflection of the structure of the observed world in the structure of a theoretical model, and a belief in the reality of the gods that go to make up this model. Here, perhaps, we have a basis for agreement between ' sym- bolists ' and ' literalists '; for it is now clear that in order to do justice to these elements of reflection and correspondence, we are by no means bound to use the controversial concept of' symbol '. Given that the gods and their relationships do in a sense reflect the structure of people's everyday worlds, there remains the question: what aspects of these worlds are reflected ? The orthodox Functionalist interpretation of Durkheim assumed that social alignment and social solidarity were the only features reflected. But this view has come in for a good deal of criticism of late. Thus Leach (I954) has complained that myth and ritual reflect social conflict as well as social solidarity. And three more recent writers (Forde, 1958; Fortes, 1959; and Goody, 1961) have added that they reflect not only social relations, but also relations between individual and group, intrapsychic relations, ecological relations, and so on. The approach advocated in this paper has the merit of leaving this question of reflection quite open: for it assumes that theory will tend to grow round those areas of experience that a society finds most problematic and disturbing. And such areas, of course, will vary from one society to the next. We can illustrate this by comparing the Kalabari world-view with one that resembles it in certain important ways: that of the Lugbara. A highlight of both world-views is the contrast and potential opposi- tion between gods who embody the forces of established social order and gods who embody the forces of the extra-social. In Kalabari the fluctuations of an untamed environment loom largest among the phenomena controlled by this latter category of gods; while in Lugbara their equivalents are far more concerned with human threats to social norms. This difference of emphasis in theory does, I think, go with a difference of 'problem'. Thus the Kalabari village is acutely conscious both of the individuality of its production techniques and of the limitations imposed on them by the difficult Delta environment. Hence the relation between skill and nature is a major problem for every villager. In a Lugbara settlement, on the other hand, productive techniques are taken for granted because they are identical with those of a wide surrounding area; and the open savannah environment opposes them with 2l8</page><page sequence="23">AN OUTLINE AND INTERPRETATION few dramatic obstacles. In such a situation, preoccupation with the balance between skill and nature not unnaturally recedes behind other worries: for instance, worries about the human threat to the established social order. Although this illustration shows only a tiny fraction of the possible range of varia- tion in 'problem', its moral is clear. Before ever he attempts to say what a given religious system does or does not reflect, the anthropologist must soak himself thoroughly in the everyday preoccupations of the believers themselves.

Resume LA CONCEPTION DE LA VIE CHEZ LES KALABARI LA conception de la vie chez les Kalabari admet quatre niveaux principaux de la realite. Tout d'abord, il y a le monde des objets materiels qui incarne la plupart de l'experience de l'homme moyen. Les explications des evenements dans ce monde ne procedent pas bien loin, cependant, sans se referer au niveau suivant - le domaine des esprits. Chaque objet dans le monde materiel possede son esprit-guide et, en outre, il y a trois grandes categories d'esprits 'libres ', les ancetres, les heros et les Gens d'Eau. Les ancetres sont les esprits trepasses des etres humains qui sont morts. Ils s'occupent principalement du bien-etre des descendants de leurs lignages et du maintien de la moralite lignagere. Les heros sont les esprits des personnes qui ont vecu autrefois avec les hommes dans leurs villages, mais qui ont disparu au lieu de mourir et n'ont laisse aucun descendant. Ils s'occupent du bien-etre du village dans son ensemble, de la moralite du village et du 2I9</page><page sequence="24">THE KALABARI WORLD-VIEW maintien des techniques productives du village. Les Gens d'Eau s'occupent des cours d'eau et de leurs poissons, ainsi que de toute espece de conduite humaine qui s'ecarte des normes sociales etablies. En somme, les Gens d'Eau controlent tout ce qui est extra-social, tant dans la nature que chez l'homme. Des mythes font le recit des incarnations humaines des Gens d'Eau, et la transformation des Gens d'Eau en heros fournit une explication de la maniere dont ce qui est nouveau et qui devie peut devenir etabli et normal. Toutes les trois categories d'esprits libres sont considerees par les Kalabari comme travaillant les unes en rapport avec les autres. Elles constituent un triangle des forces dont l'homme essaie d'in- fluencer l'equilibre en sa faveur par l'utilisation des rites. On croit que les rites doivent leur efficacite a l'action de l'esprit meme de l'adorateur. Et etant donne que la part decisive de l'adorateur est du meme ordre d'existence que le sujet de l'adoration, il n'est point surprenant qu'il existe une conception resolue du culte des esprits qui voit la puissance des esprits comme largement dependante des soins de leurs adorateurs. Le niveau suivant de la realite Kalabari est aussi different du domaine des esprits que celui-ci l'est du monde materiel. Ici, les concepts importants sont ceux de tamune - le principe createur, et so - le destin. Chaque individu a son propre tamune qui le cree et qui est respon- sable de sa mort. Entre la naissance et la mort, le tamune determine le cours de la vie de l'individu au moyen de son so ou destin. Bien qu'il n'ait aucun tamune chaque lignage, de meme que chaque village, a son so collectif. Le so collectif determine le cours de la vie de son groupe de la meme fa5on que le so particulier determine celui de l'individu. En tant que con- cepts explicatifs le tamune et le so fournissent une serie d'interpretations d'ordre superieur qui comprennent non seulement les rapports entre les personnes et autres choses dans le monde materiel, mais egalement les rapports entre les personnes et les divers esprits 'libres '. Comme les esprits, les divers tamune et so sont des objets d'adoration. Mais puisque ceux-ci ne sont plus des etres du meme ordre que l'esprit de l'adorateur, la conception fondamentale est maintenant tout a fait differente. L'adoration sur ce niveau implique des idees de la sujetion humaine aux puissances superieures qui s'opposent fortement aux idees concernant l'adoration des esprits. Au plus haut niveau de la realite Kalabari, tous les divers tamune et so sont percus comme autant de manifestations d'un 'Grand Tamune' et d'un 'Grand So '. Ces etres unitaires constituent le niveau le plus eleve et le plus comprehensif d'explication qui fixe la vie Kalabari dans le contexte d'un monde plus vaste en dehors des confins du delta du Niger. Jusqu'a quel point la conception de la vie chez les Kalabari fournit-elle des explications qui approchent celles pourvues par la theorie dans notre propre culture ? Si nous adoptons une vue positiviste de la science, il est difficile de percevoir un lien quelconque. Mais si nous etudions des exemples concrets de la creation des theories scientifiques qui impliquent le choix et le developpement des modeles analogues, nous pouvons percevoir certains paral- leles. En effet, bien que la conception de la vie chez les Kalabari soit - sous tous les rapports importants - pre-scientifique, la plupart des particularites problematiques des formes theoriques Kalabari surgissent a nouveau dans le domaine de la theorie scientifique du 20ome siecle. Dans notre propre culture, la consideration de la nature de la science a conduit a des realisations considerables dans la determination du rapport entre les formes theoriques et la fonction explicative qu'elles remplissent. En appliquant l'analogie scientifique au systeme moins conscient de pensees des Kalabari, on peut utiliser le resultat de ces realisations afin de diriger l'attention sur les rapports entre la forme theorique et la fonction explicative dans une situation ou ils sont caches et implicites. 220</page></plain_text>
