Pp. xvi + 202. NLG 141.04, $75. The Leiden edition of the Peshitta, now nearly complete, has prompted a fresh appre- ciation of this version, especially with regard to its value as a witness to the proto-MT. The</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 627 primary frustration for biblical scholars consulting the Peshitta has been in trying to deter- mine whether a particular reading witnesses to a Hebrew Vorlage different from the MT or is simply characteristic of the version (i.e., translation technique). Williams's study lights the way out of this quandary. In the introduction, he responds to what could be a potential objection to his research, namely, how the study of the Peshitta, a translated text whose origins are shrouded in mystery, can yield insights into Syriac syntax. The remainder of the volume treats particular aspects of Syriac syntax: the genitive, the adjective "all" ( kl ), direct-object constructions, the waw, the verb, speech formulae, infinitives, prepositions, demonstratives, and the particle "behold." The index of verses cited at the end of the volume will allow biblical scholars to retrieve with ease W.'s explanation for a particular Peshitta reading. The author builds a strong case for taking into account the style, syntax, and transla- tion technique of Peshitta 1 Kings before considering individual readings that vary from those of the MT. In his discussion of kl , W. notes the cases where kl is absent from the MT but present in the Peshitta, and vice versa. He writes: "Some occasions may display a non-Masoretic Vorlage, but consistent patterns warn against using this explanation too readily" (p. 39). He then illustrates several instances where the addition or omission of kl can be explained internally as an aspect of the Peshitta' s translation technique. However, not all readings need to be accounted for internally. External evidence still has its place. For example, in one of W.'s cases (1 Kgs 16:5), the MT has ""IE7N1 and the Peshitta reads wkl mdm. In this instance, the LXX reading, Kai mvta à, may suggest that a non- Masoretic Vorlage is behind the Peshitta (see also 1 Kgs 16:27). Thus, W.'s internal &lt; approach to individual Peshitta readings can be complemented by external evidence when it is available. The detailed consideration given to particular aspects of Syriac syntax illuminates the discrete function of particular constructions. The various constructions for introducing the direct object seem, at times, interchangeable, but W. distills evidence that accounts for the Syriac translator's preference for one construction over another. His treatment of prepo- sitions reveals that the Peshitta never imitates the Hebrew in this regard. Special treatment is given to Syriac qdm: when is followed by "Lord" (literally "in the eyes of the Lord"), then the Peshitta renders with qdm ("before the Lord"). But if "OTS is followed by a human person (1 Kgs 11:19), then it is rendered literally ( bcyny ). W. classi- fies this translation technique as "anti-anthropomorphic" in that it represents a tendency to avoid any reference to a part of the body in connection with God. W. does well to note this phenomenon so that textual critics will not trip over it as a "variant" reading; but the classification "anti-anthropomorphic" may give the reader a false impression about the Peshitta. In 1 Kgs 8:29 and 8:52, Solomon implores God, "Let your eyes be open," a more explicit anthropomorphism than yet the Peshitta renders it literally (&gt;ynyk). Perhaps the tendency to translate with qdm is best described as a type of reverential lan- guage that is preferred when referring to God. The Peshitta reveals no tendency to imitate Hebrew verb forms. Speech formulae (i.e., constructions with the root 5mr) also adhere to Syriac idiom. The use of the waw is deter- mined by Syriac syntax, not by the Hebrew Vorlage. Here, W. adduces several examples where BHS has mistakenly ascribed a variation on the waw in the Peshitta to a variant Hebrew Vorlage. These errors provide further evidence that Peshitta readings should never be considered in isolation. The author is also among an increasing number of scholars who</page><page sequence="3">628 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 65, 2003 suspect that Peshitta mss. 9al/am may represent a textual tradition older than Peshitta MS. 7a 1 (the base text of the Leiden edition). This volume adds to the increasing body of evidence that the Peshitta, though a translation of the Hebrew, does not mirror Hebrew syntax in Syriac. This news needs to be disseminated in response to T. Nöldeke's remark in the preface to the second edition of his grammar ( Kurzgefasste syrische Grammatik [Leipzig: Tauchnitz, 1898]) that because the Peshitta frequently approximates the Hebrew, it is difficult to discern between true Syriac idiom and Hebraisms. W. unearths the true Syriac idiom of the Peshitta for all to see. Biblical scholars will want to consult W.'s study for its text-critical observations, and Syriac students will enjoy his insights into the Peshitta' s syntax, which further demonstrate the value of the Peshitta as a witness to the Syriac language.
