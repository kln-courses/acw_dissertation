<plain_text><page sequence="1">CULTURE AND MAN: LESLIE A. WHITE'S THESIS RE-EXAMINED' JOHN W. COPELAND T HE THEORIES propounded by Leslie A. White on the relationships between man and culture are worthy of serious attention; they are widely accepted but they have not received sufficiently detailed examination from the standpoint of the logic of scientific method. The theories in question are the following: (A) Culture controls man. Man cannot control culture but can merely react to it. Culture is the independent variable, and the man the dependent variable. (B) Men think that they choose the beliefs they have but this is an illusion. CULTURE AND HUMAN WEAKNESS White's first claim of interest to us is that man does not and cannot control culture, or "exert any control over culture." Since White (1949:139ff) defines culture as "an organization of phenomena-acts (patterns of behavior), objects (tools; things made with tools), ideas (belief, knowledge), and sentiments (atti- tudes, 'values')--that is dependent upon the use of symbols," his assertion that man cannot control culture can only mean that men cannot control their beliefs, customs, institutions, languages, tools, techniques, dwellings, or art forms. The first type of evidence2 which White (1949:332) offers in support of his theory is as follows: During the last century we have witnessed attempts to control tiny and relatively insignificant segments of our culture, such as spelling, the calendar, the system of weights and measures, to name but a few. ... . But what successes can we point to? Reform in spelling has been negligible. .... Such spellings-and-pronunciations as rough, cough, dough, and through are much too strong to yield to our puny efforts. It usually takes a great political and social upheaval to effect a significant change in spelling or a calendrical system as the French and Bolshevik revolutions have made clear. And as for the metric system, it has found a place among the little band of esoterics in science, but yards, ounces, rods, pints, and furlongs still serve . . . the layman. 1 Time for study and writing of the present paper was made possible by a Charles Merrill Foundation grant. I am indebted to Professors George P. Murdock, Arthur Tuden, Frank Young, and Louise Sweet for reading and discussing with me the earlier version of this paper. 2 In this context "first type" means simply first in the list of evidences given by White in his frequently reprinted essay, "Man's Control Over Civilization: An Anthropocentric Illusion." 109 VOL. 19, 1963</page><page sequence="2">110 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY There are two points concerning the meaning of the basic claim which should be mentioned immediately. First, White does not restrict his claim here (or else- where) to the view that individuals cannot control their culture; he is saying that neither individuals nor groups can control culture. Secondly, as evidence for his claim that men have not succeeded in controlling culture, White asserts that re- forms have not been achieved; that except in cases of political and social upheaval, significant changes (reforms) generally do not occur. So that as evidence for the claim that men cannot control culture, White insists that significant planned changes have not succeeded. Thus in denying that men can control culture, White is denying that they can change their culture in accordance with their plans. Does he mean by "control" something more than that? If there is any plus or surplus of meaning, I have been unable to detect it in White's writings; no definition of "con- trol" is given. It is, of course, possible that when White says that men cannot control culture, he means that men in a given culture cannot have or manipulate cultural (e.g., technological or social) systems which are completely foreign to their experience. But since this is a virtual truism, it is difficult to believe that White would expend so much time and polemical energy fighting on its behalf. Again, it is possible that when White asserts that men cannot control culture he means that men cannot regulate its complete course; White repeatedly insists, following Durkheim, that man is not omnipotent and therefore he cannot control culture. But psychologists, sociologists, and theologians (White's main targets) have not, to my knowledge, ever said that man is omnipotent. Even the people whom White quotes as believing that science can save us, that science can enable us to remake the world to a considerable degree, did not say that man could change everything in the world. That man is not omnipotent is self-evident. But the claim that man cannot control culture unless he is omnipotent is not only not self-evident; there is no evidence for it at all. White's major thesis either rests on an arbitrary and elusive definition of "control" and is an empty tautology, or it is false, as we shall soon see. The evidence which White does adduce in support of the theory that men can- not exert any control over culture is very inadequate. There is, presumably, a reason why spelling habits are relatively slow changing. As White unwittingly acknowl- edges, these are "tiny and relatively insignificant segments of our culture." There are vastly more important matters which we believe need to be changed and pro- gressively altered. In areas of real concern, reforms (significant planned changes) often occur. TVA and TWA are evidence that men have changed their techniques and tools in accordance with their plans, and thus, given White's definition, have changed their culture. Or consider planned changes in communications and in production techniques, such as the use of computers and the automation of factories.</page><page sequence="3">WHITE'S THESIS RE-EXAMINED 111 White does not mention these, for they would not help this case. Indeed, his ex- amples are quite selective, not representative. We need not draw counter-examples only from modern, industrialized societies. In Netherlands New Guinea, Awiitigaaj, in order to accomplish one of his other aims, planned to alter a basic institution of his village and he successfully accomplished both of his objectives. (I am indebted to Professor George P. Mur- dock for calling my attention to this case; see Pospisil 1958.) An even more damaging criticism can be made of White's approach to this matter. Suppose large groups of scientists and scholars should come to believe that it is terribly important to the nation to change our system of weights and measures and even our spelling system. Convinced that reforms are badly needed, they would persuade Congress to have all government agencies use the metric system, a simplified spelling system, and the like. What would White say then? Would he still say that man cannot control culture? Since White (1949:350) asserts that man "exerts no control whatever over his culture and theoretically there is no pos- sibility of his ever doing so" (italics mine), he would have to answer the pre- vious question in the same old way. It is possible that White is using a private, idio- syncratic meaning of "theoretical," but to students of the logic of scientific method, his claim just cited means that it is logically impossible for man to exert any control over his culture. If this is what White means to assert, he holds his thesis as a dogma, not as an hypothesis. He assumes that there cannot be, in the nature of the case, any evidence against his claim; anything relevant could only count as evidence for it. The passage cited shows that White would not give up his doctrine, no matter what the evidence might be. Consequently, an appeal to empirical evidence be- comes irrelevant; White has removed the question from that domain. But it is not necessary to base the claim that "White does not treat his thesis regarding man and culture as a scientific hypothesis" solely upon his assertion that it is theoretically impossible for men to control culture; the fact that a very important matter has been omitted from White's writings is also evidence for the criticism. Most students of the logic of scientific method maintain that for any em- pirical proposition to be cognitively meaningful, it must be possible to specify kinds of evidence which would confirm (or tend to confirm) the proposition, and it must also be possible to specify types of evidence which would disconfirm (or tend to disconfirm) the proposition in question. This does not mean that there must be evidence which in fact counts against the proposition; it means that one must be able to conceive or imagine states of affairs which would-if they occurred- tend to disconfirm the proposition. In reading White, one looks in vain for this evidence; the fact that no attempt is made to supply this type of information</page><page sequence="4">112 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY strengthens the claim that White does not present his basic thesis as a scientific hypothesis. The second type of evidence which White (1949:350) uses in support of his view that man cannot control culture is as follows: [Man] can harness the energies of rivers, fuels, and atoms because he, as one of the forces of nature, lies outside their respective systems and can therefore act upon them. But man, as an animal organism, as a species, lies within the man-culture system, and there he is the dependent, not the independent, variable; his behavior is merely the function of his culture, not its determinant. Both theoretically and practically, there- fore, it is possible for man to exert more control over the weather than over culture, for he can exert some control over the former even now and he may increase this con- trol in the future. But he exerts no control whatever over his culture and theoretically there is no possibility of his ever doing so. There are several defects in this passage employing the inside-outside analogy. First, the basic claim becomes an empty one. (A) When White insists that man is the dependent variable in the man-culture system, he is speaking of man as an animal organism, man minus status, role, or cultural experience of any kind. ("The formula for human behavior is: Human organism x Cultural stimuli --&gt; Human behavior." White 1949:18). Consequently, to say that unacculturated human organisms cannot exert any control over culture is to say nothing significant at all, since no one ever said that they could. (B) If the inside-outside analogy were sound, of course, it would enable White to justify the avoidance of empirical evidence: for the a priori contention that nothing within a system can succeed in altering the system would permit White to ignore the ways in which acculturated human beings change elements of their culture. Secondly, there are two crucial inconsistencies within this passage which be- come clear once we draw out the implications of its assertions. (A) Just as human organisms devoid of cultural experience cannot exert any control over culture (an empty truism), so these same organisms obviously could not control weather, rivers, fuels, and atoms either. (B) If the fact that man is within the man-culture system were to prevent man from exerting control over his culture, it would follow that since culture is part of the man-culture system, culture could not control man either (despite White's emphatic assertion to the contrary). Indeed, how can White consistently say that man can control the external world, when man is part of the man-nature system? Thus White's inside-outside argument leads to a trivial con- clusion and contains critical inconsistencies. What White fails to see is that the a priori and dogmatic character of his claim</page><page sequence="5">WHITE'S THESIS RE-EXAMINED 113 that man cannot control culture makes any appeal to empirical evidence-whether to spelling habits, measuring systems, or fashions in dress-completely irrelevant. The "evidence" which White uses to support his thesis enables him to ignore much human behavior. Just as certain classical metaphysicians and scientists sat in their armchairs and insisted that they could thereby know truths about the world, so White takes the position that no matter what happens, no matter what men do, they cannot control culture. If some other theorist conducts or refers to actual em- pirical investigations which show that certain individuals or groups do make significant planned changes in belief systems, art forms, and/or other culture traits, White can ignore them, for his a priori doctrine tells him in advance that it is impossible for them to do so. EXPLANATIONS AND PREDICTIONS White's second claim of interest to us is that culture controls man, and there- fore man can only react to culture. This point of view is expressed and explained in the following passage (White 1949:337): Everyone-every individual, every generation, every group-has, since the very earliest period of human history, been born into a culture, a civilization, of some sort. .... All cultures, whatever their respective degrees of development, have tech- nologies (tools, machines), social systems (customs, institutions), beliefs (lore, phil- osophy, science), and forms of art. This means that when a baby is born into a cul- tural milieu, he will be influenced by it. As a matter of fact, his culture will determine how he will think, feel, and act. It will determine what language he will speak, what clothes, if any, he will wear, what gods he will believe in, how he will marry, select and prepare his foods, treat the sick, and dispose of the dead. What else could one do but react to the culture that surrounds him from birth to death?3 As an illustration of the way in which culture controls us, White points to the pressures upon human behavior of such cultural traits as fashions. With respect to the length of women's skirts, White (1949:333), basing his claims upon Kroeber's well-known studies, asserts that "women have nothing to say about it. Even the designers and creators must conform to the curve of change. We find no control by man-or woman-here, only an inexorable and impersonal trend." White (1949:353-354) writes: 3 This sounds much like the voice of that paradigm of social and political conservatism, Edmund Burke, speaking again but in the twentieth century, this time in the clothes of an anthropologist. It is as if White were using anthropology to further (preordained?) political doctrines.</page><page sequence="6">114 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY From the cultural determinist's point of view, human beings are merely the instru- ments through which cultures express themselves. A physician, saving lives each day, is an instrument through which certain cultural forces express themselves. . ... The gangster, evangelist, revolutionist, reformer, policeman, impoverished beggar, wealthy parasite, teacher, soldier, and shaman are likewise instruments of cultural action and expression; each is a type of primate organism grasped and wielded by a certain set of culture traits. White's attempt to illustrate how his theory regards human beings involves some serious difficulties. In the first place, for White to insist that Ghandhi, Churchill, Hitler, and Mussolini were merely primate organisms "grasped and wielded by a certain set of culture traits" does not help us to explain why these individuals, rather than other persons in the same cultural traditions, did what they did. It is one thing to insist that an understanding of an individual requires that we know the traits of the culture in which he operates; it is quite another to assert that the behavior of the individual can be predicted and explained if (and only if) he is viewed as an instrument "grasped and wielded by a certain set of culture traits." The latter is, incidentally, picture-thinking. Secondly, if White's claim that culture controls man means that the relation between culture and man is a one-way relation, that there is no interaction, that no individual or group ever influences culture traits, his theory oversimplifies the facts. The very attempt to buttress the thesis leads to counter-evidence quite readily. For example, White (1949:357) says that "Our role in this process is a modest one. Neither as groups nor as individuals do we have a choice of roles or of fates." White's claim, however, characterizes static societies far more than dynamic ones. For one of the cultural influences in, but not restricted to, American life is the value placed upon success, the rejection of the notion that each person has one and only one role or station in life and must "stay put," in favor of the notion of upward mobility, striving to escape from roles with which one is dissatisfied. And in fact individuals and groups do alter their positions; their deliberate strivings are suc- cessful in many cases. Indeed, they create new roles as well as alter old ones. This should indicate the causal interaction between culture and human behavior.4 White (1949:338) says that "There is not a single question that we would want to ask about culture that can be answered by saying 'Man did thus and so'." He adds that explanations of cultural practices which assert "Man wanted them that way" are absurd. Now there are two important points which need to be made 4 White distinguishes between culture and behavior most sharply or forcefully in his 1959 essay, "The Concept of Culture."</page><page sequence="7">WHITE'S THESIS RE-EXAMINED 115 concerning this claim. First, it assumes that there are two, and only two possibilities: either (A) All cultural practices can be explained by "Man wanted them that way," or (B) No cultural practices can be explained by "Man wanted them that way." But the proper reply is that while human wants are not the sole or total cause of particular events, they are often necessary conditions, significant causal factors required for the explanation and prediction of some events. The successful space flights of Titov, Gagarin, Glenn, and Carpenter could not have been predicted or explained in complete independence of the wants of these men and of a num- ber of other men associated with their projects. At one point White (1949:353) says that his position does not deny that men want to do things and that their actions have consequences, but that what the cultural determinist insists upon is the origin of their purposes and goals, and these are to be found in the culture. But the impact of his position as White ordinarily expounds it is such as to deny that human wants can be causal factors. It is this emphasis that is mistaken; no disclaimer will hide or correct it. The second point is that when White says that explanations in terms of human wants are absurd, and follows this claim with the assertion that "A device that explains everything explains nothing," his latter assertion is a damaging admission, since White constantly "explains" cultural practices by saying that culture did it, the culture was responsible. On White's premises, how would we explain the writing of his own book, The Science of Culture? White (1949:356, 184) insists that "if an adequate under- standing should come about as a consequence of a science of culture it would not have been 'us' who achieved it but our culture" and "It would be more realistic to say that his thinking and feeling are things that the culture does to the individual than to say that they are things that he does." Given White's theory, on the title page of The Science of Culture in the place where the author's name usually ap- pears, we should read "the culture wrote it." White was not the cause, or a part of the cause, of the appearance of the book; rather he was merely an instrument manipulated by cultural traits. No one ever did anything, on this theory. Furthermore, it is inconsistent for White to criticize sociologists for alleged anthropomorphism, and psychologists for not realizing that psychological processes cannot explain cultural traits, and the like. For on White's theory that the culture, not the individual, is always responsible, sociologists are not guilty of anthro- pomorphism, the culture is guilty. Robert Lynd really did not say that culture does not "enamel its fingernails, or vote, or believe in capitalism, but people do"; the culture enunciated that doctrine. Nor did V. Gordon Childe really say that</page><page sequence="8">116 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY "changes in culture . . . can be initiated, controlled, or delayed by the conscious and deliberate choice of their human authors and executors." No, on White's doctrine, the culture said it. No matter what evidence or counter-examples one cites in reply to White's doctrine that the culture, not the individual, is responsible for any changes in cul- ture or human behavior, White will not allow them to count as evidence against his thesis; he arbitrarily protects the thesis against refutation. This is a dogmatic way to hold a claim, and it indicates that here again White defends a view not as if it were an hypothesis to which empirical evidence is relevant, but rather in such a way as to transform it into a purely verbal device. The thesis which White is really insisting upon (though it gets confused with some other claims) is that we should (try to) understand cultural phenomena in terms of their origins. He insists that to explain any social or cultural phenomena, we must find the cultural antecedents (and concomitants, he sometimes adds). At times White writes as though once the cultural antecedents are known, the phenomena is understood; there is nothing more to seek. Instead of regarding knowledge of cultural antecedents simply as a necessary condition, he treats it as sufficient for understanding. But this is a mistake. For the consecuences of cultural practices are important for understanding also. Simply seeing the cultural anteced- ents of a practice may not give us this information. A traditional practice may take on new functions, fulfill new and different purposes. Though the analogy is not exact, it is useful to point out that those who are best acquainted with the ante- cedents of contemporary physics, anthropology, or sociology (historians of these subjects) may not necessarily have the best understanding of current developments in these fields. One particularly unhappy example of White's attempt to treat subjects in terms of origins is his theory of human beliefs. White (1949:349fn.) writes: Philosophies possess, hold, animate, guide and direct the articulate, protoplasmic mechanisms that are men. Whether a man-an average man, typical of his group- "believes in" Christ or Buddha, Genesis or Geology, Determinism or Free Will, is not a matter of his own choosing. His philosophy is merely the response of his neuro- sensory-muscular-glandular system to the streams of cultural stimuli impinging upon him from the outside. What is called "philosophizing" is merely the interaction of these cultural elements within his organism. His "choice" of philosophic beliefs is merely a neurological expression of the superior strength of some of these extra-somatic cul- tural forces. So, a reader of White's articles and books does not have a choice of whether to</page><page sequence="9">WHITE'S THESIS RE-EXAMINED 117 become a cultural determinist or not. Are we to wait until we are "possessed" by culturology, or should we do some things which will put us in a better position to get "possessed?" But if we did the latter, we wouldn't have done it; since we couldn't possibly have chosen to do so, the culture did it to us. In order to further his claim that culture controls man, White cites paragraphs from the writings of Darwin and Poincare in which these men wrote about cases in which it did not seem to them that they provided the vital ideas. But what White ignores is the fact that they could report such events only because they could contrast these cases with others in which they did figure out the important theories. So that White's emphasis, designed to further his theory that the culture is always responsible, never the individual, is a half truth which needs to be corrected in the light of a wider body of evidence. We generally assume that whether or not an hypothesis is correct, or more probable than its alternatives, is a matter to be decided by reflection upon the avail- able evidence. In the latter process one sees, among other things, the logical impli- cations of the proposition (s) in question, the way in which each relates to others we already know, and the like. Now one reason why we believe deliberation does occur in some cases is that by contrast there are other instances in which views are accepted quite arbitrarily. Some voting in university faculty meetings occurs after careful committee work and deliberation. But in some other cases the voting ap- proaches the ideal limit of the perfectly arbitrary or thoughtless, because no one cares much what the outcome may be; the issues are not deemed important. Given White's own theory, it would follow that White's "choice" of cultural determinism (and his other beliefs) is "merely a neurological expression of the superior strength of . . . cultural forces." Does his view of beliefs as merely due to the strength of certain cultural forces imply that it makes no sense to talk about the truth of human beliefs and whether there is adequate evidence for them? If so, this is intellectual nihilism, and White's theory of beliefs has consequences as dan- gerous for White's theories (beliefs) as for those of anyone else. It is necessary to distinguish between the cause (or causes) of a belief, and the grounds for the belief (those reasons which could honestly be offered in its sup- port). There are cases in which the major causal factor in the acceptance of a belief was the fact that a person had that belief instilled in him in his home environment; there may be or may not be evidence in support of that belief; the truth of, or warrant for, the belief is a separate question from the environmental influences which led him to hold the view. The confusion of the origins or cause of a belief with the truth of a belief is known as the genetic fallacy. When White sees that his doctrines that culture controls man and that man</page><page sequence="10">118 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY can only react to culture are not wholly persuasive, he employs two strategies. First, in two uncharacteristic, isolated passages he denies that his thesis means what it clearly seems to mean. White (1949:174) writes that his view of the relation of culture and man does not require that the individual organism be viewed as a passive thing. The individual does not receive cultural material from the outside in a purely passive way, like a cup into which coffee is poured, nor does it reflect this material like a perfect mirror does an image. The human organism is a dynamic system. It not only receives cultural elements from the outside, it acts upon them . . . We do not . . . minimize the dynamic nature of the individual as an active as well as a reactive organism. We are merely saying that a consideration of the dynamic character of this organism does not help us to explain the form and content of its reactions and responses. This disclaimer cannot be taken seriously as a representative statement of White's position because White's endlessly repeated claim that "man cannot control culture but culture controls man" has the effect of insisting that man does merely receive cultural elements from outside, he does not act upon them. In the second odd passage, White (1949:176fn.) writes that "Any response of the human organism is the result of countless antecedent and concomitant events that we may term 'causes.' The human organism is constantly organizing and synthesizing these causative factors on the one hand, and expressing the resultant behavior overtly on the other." But if the claim that "culture controls man, and man cannot control culture" means anything at all, its author cannot consistently admit that the human organism can organize and synthesize casual factors. It is no wonder that White does not account for this human activity. If he should say that this task belongs to psychology, not culturology, the reply is that even the psychologist could not predict or explain such behavior if he had to assume doctrines which in effect deny that it can occur. White's second strategy (1949:173), when pressed, is to shift from the claim that culture controls man to the weaker thesis that whatever men do--whether they absorb their culture or alter it, they do so because their culture has provided the elements which make possible their activities; their actions are outgrowths of cultural traits. Now it should be pointed out that to say that all human be- havior (of interest to the science of culture) is due to overt, external cultural traits can neither be proved nor disproved. Instead of regarding it as a factual proposition which is true or false, it should be converted into an imperative which functions as a heuristic device: always try to find the cultural antecedents of the behavior; if you don't at first succeed, keep trying and you probably will.</page><page sequence="11">WHITE'S THESIS RE-EXAMINED 119 What White should have said, but did not, is that the approach which regards individuals' achievements as a product of cultural patterns of considerable scope and depth is one legitimate approach, and that it lends itself to striking predictions and explanations of human behavior not otherwise obtainable. Had White shown that on the basis of this approach he and others had made non-vague predictions, which were later fulfilled, and explained cultural phenomena in such a way as to withstand critical examination, then he would have been in a good position to say that his approach is warranted. But he has fulfilled neither of these conditions,5 yet he continues to theorize as though his culturology were all-sufficient. SUMMARY In examining White's assertion that culture controls man, we found that the claim should have been set forth as an hypothesis, and then modified in the light of a comprehensive examination of the evidence. Instead it was presented and held dogmatically. The effect of such a procedure is to frustrate instead of to fulfill the expectation that the requirements for a science will be met. When we inspect the evidence which White supplies for the theory that man cannot control culture, we see that the proposition can only mean that humans, either as individuals or as groups, cannot deliberately change culture traits, such as tools or techniques. But we saw that in fact men have made such significant planned changes, so that White's thesis does not withstand examination. On White's view, no matter whether the group ossifies certain culture traits or introduces new techniques or tools to replace the old, it is simply reacting to its culture. This view reminds us of that type of theological position which says no matter whether the sparrow flies or dies, God caused it. Both positions are equally ad hoc; both are stated in such a way that no possible evidence could count against them and thus they are guaranteed against refutation. But this very fact shows that neither of them is a scientific hypothesis. This paper does not consider some very significant views with which White has been prominently identified, e.g., evolutionary and energy theories. The topics discussed herein, however, are illustrative of the kinds of problems which must be surmounted if White's theories are to meet the requirements for a genuine science.
