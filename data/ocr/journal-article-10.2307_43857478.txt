<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Early AKAN Head-Variant Glyph? Boston (Mario Giron-Ábrego). This brief study will focus on glyph pA9 from the San Bartolo stone block hieroglyphic text conservatively dated to ca. 300 BCE (Saturno et al. 2006), and propose that this anthropomorphic profile might repre- sent an archaic variant of the Classic Period AKAN logogram [200-900 CE] (Figure 1 and 2). The glyphic collocation in question is part of a longer text of at least ten glyph blocks in length. This text, the earliest Lowland Maya hieroglyphic inscription so far uncovered and which currently eludes a definite decipherment, was found by archaeologist Boris Bel- tran in 2005 at the Preclassic site of San Bartolo, Guatemala (Saturno et al. 2006). The enigmatic and multifaceted supernatural Ahkan , or god A' as it was originally called by Zimmermann (1956: 162- 163), prior to the phonetic decipherment of his name by Grube and Nahm (1994:714-715), is the Dionysian Maya deity of intoxication, excessive pleasure and irrational nature (Grube 2001, 2004; Stone and Zender 2011:38-39; Taube 1992:14-17). Ahkan is a god of many aspects and Maya art reflects a multitude of his diverse manifestations (Fig- ure 3 and 4). The Ahkan complex ranges from a connection to alcoholic substances such as chih , a fermented beverage made from the maguey plant (Grube 2004; Grube and Nahm 1994:714-715; Stone and Zender 2011:39), to a transforma- tion into Jatz 'oon Ahkan "Striking Ahkan," a patron god of Mesoamerican gladiatorial blood-sports (Taube and Zender 2011:202-204; Zender 2004:5-8). In the past, Ahkan has Fig. 1 a) San Bartolo stone block glyphic text section pA6-pA10. Drawing by David Stuart (from Saturno et al. 2006:Fig.4); b) En- larged pA9 glyph. been associated with the gods of death, due to his occasion- al scenes of self-decapitation, a skeletal lower jaw and an AK'AB "darkness" glyph that sometimes covers the upper half of his face (Grube and Nahm 1994:714-116; Schellhas 1904:10-15; Taube 1991:14-17). Although Ahkan 's associa- tion with death remains somewhat nebulous, it is interesting to note that his name is a word for "wasp" in a number Maya languages (Stone and Zender 2011:39). Stone and Zender (201 1 :39) further observe that such relationship could explain both the death imagery (1) and the blackened eyes as reminis- cent of the wasp, perhaps the Vespula alascensis (Figure 4). The earliest known instances of Ahkan in Maya art come from a Late Preclassic fragmentary mural portion from San Bartolo, Guatemala, and from two Early Classic examples: one found as part of glyph A9 on Copan Stela 63, and a sec- ond from a cache carved vessel (see Taube 2011:50-57, Fig. 5). These three early examples of Ahkan portray a gruesome aspect of this deity, showing skeletal lower jaws and human femurs on their heads (Figure 5). Both of the Early Classic images bear the so-called "percent sign" on their cheeks, but only the carved cache vessel and the San Bartolo examples show the disembodied eyeballs on their foreheads, and the latter appears to spurt blood in a dramatic fashion. Both the "percentage sign" and the disembodied eyeball on the fore- head are diagnostic features of this deity. A fourth possible instance of an early Ahkan glyphic profile might be glyph A5 on the Late Preclassic Fidel Tristan Jade Museum's jadeite plaque INS 2007 (Mora-Marin 2001 :Fig. 18). This pro- file, engulfed by a striated U-shaped element (2), shows an Fig. 2. a) The San Bartolo stone block text in the context where it was found in 2005.

Returning to glyph pA9, it should be mentioned that it is the penultimate glyph of the surviving and incomplete San Bartolo stone block text (Figure 2). In another work that ex- pands on the insights and observations by others (see Houston 2006:1249-1250; see Mora-Marin 2008; see Saturno et al. 2006), I (Giron-Ábrego n.d.) argued that the glyphic section pA6-pA10 of this text corresponds to a nominal phrase (Fig- ure la). This nominal phrase begins with two glyphs that read PA': CHAN A J AW pa' chan aj aw or "lord of the split sky place." I suspect that the collocations that follow this section, pA8, pA9, and pAl 0, would correspond to additional epithets of this individual's personal name (Figure 2b). As noted by Marc Zender (personal communication 2013), the clues to pA9's reading remain scant due to the glyph's abraded condition, unclear and unique epigraphic context, and the almost complete absence of contemporaneous glyph- ic data to which it could be compared. pA9 also lacks any apparent affixation that could clarify its decipherment, save for a lock of hair on the head's back that may simply be part of the larger sign. The expected aj- or -na phonetic complements that would reinforced the AKAN reading are not evidently present (Grube and Nahm 1994:714-715). An- other of Ahkan' s features, notable for its absence on pA9, is the "percentage sign" which can be seen on the cheeks of some of the profiles and glyphic head- variants in Figures 7 Fig. 4. a) Common Yellow Jacket Wasp (Vespula alascensis) (adapt- ed from a photograph by Fir0002/Flagstaffotos under GNU Free Documentation License); b) Mok Chih "pulque sickeness" Ahkan holding ajar with AK'AB "darkness" markings swarmed by bees or Yellow Jacket wasps (after Stone and Zender 201 1 : 145 and vase K2284). and 5 (Grube 2004; Grube and Nahm 1994:714-715; Taube 1992:14; Schellhas 1904:10-15). On the other hand, however, it is important to note that within the spectrum and variations of the known AKAN head- variants the "percentage sign" is not always present. This is the case for the disembodied eye as well (see Taube 1 992), which as was mentioned above, is another recurrent feature of this deity (Figures 5 and 6). At the same time, Houston (2000:144) observes that in Preclas- sic writing "[hieroglyphs tend to fill an entire glyph block, with relatively little suffixation," and that "signs representing heads, occur in great diversity. Possibly the heads represent lists of gods, brought together as patrons of a particular site" and thus it is not implausible to suggest that logographic profiles such as pA9, may represent early variants of deities widely featured in later Classic Period Maya writing and art. The evidence to propose an AKAN reading for pA9 is based on two morphological features of this glyph (see Fig- ures lb and 7). Inevitably, the still poorly understood nature of Preclassic Maya hieroglyphic writing makes these features to some extent conditional, but in light of the above men- tioned traits that define the glyphic AKAN, these are none- theless intriguing and worthy of consideration. I suggest that if the partially erased upper area of this surely logographic portrait was once a section that darkened the eyes and the forehead, then it would conform with Karl Taube 's observa- tion that "[t]he most striking characteristic of this death god is the black horizontal band across the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the blanched whiteness of the rest of his face" (Taube 1 992: 1 7). It is reminiscent of the head- variant on the glyphic caption that belongs to the floating Jatz 'oon Ahkan from the Altar de Sacrificios vase (see Figure 3b and 7g), as well as to the face of the "self-decapitating" Ahkan that sits cross-legged (Figure 3a). Moreover, it is tempting to consider, that if the detail on pA9's forehead represents a disembodied eye, we would then have at least two of diagnostic features of the logographic AKAN represented on this Preclassic glyph from San Bartolo: the pervasive blackened upper half of his face and the intermittently present gouged eyeball on the forehead. mexicon # Vol. XXXVI # August 2014</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 5. a) A Late Preclassic Ahkan portrait based on a fragmentary mural section from the site of San Bartolo, Guatemala (after Taube 201 1 :Fig. 5; b) Ahkan profile emerging from the jaws of a serpent and smoking a cigar.

Acknowledgements I would like to thank Marc Zender for informing me about the earliest instances of ahkan in Maya art, as well as Nikolai Grube, James Brady, Jeremy Coltman and the anonymous reviewers for commenting on an earlier draft of this research note. I am indebted to David Mora-Marin for so kindly pro- viding me with the high resolution line drawing of the Late Preclassic Fidel Tristan Jade Museum's jadeite plaque INS 2007 seen on Figure 6. Gratitude is also due to The Paul &amp; Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans for their gen- erous support. Unless noted otherwise, the opinions and any errors or misapprehensions expressed here are my sole responsibility. End Notes ( 1 ) Maya gods and supernaturais associated with death tend show insect-like qualities such as limbs and wings. (2) To my knowledge, the only other instance of this U-shape striated ele- ment is that on glyph Al 2 from the Hauberg stela (see Figure 6b). Linda Scheie identified Hauberg stela's glyph Al 2 as a possible "emblem glyph" but no reading was proposed (Scheie and Miller 1986:191). In either of these two cases it is difficult to say if this U-shaped element is part of the logogram, or if it functions as a phonetic complement to the main sign.</page></plain_text>
