<plain_text><page sequence="1">SEX IN STONE AND THE VEDIC MTTHUNA By SADASHIV A. DANGE The topic of erotic sculptures in India has attracted a number of scholars;1 and, as early as 1925 there have been efforts to interpret the coitus- poses and other mithuna- motifs.2 Though, in sculpture, the distinct mithuna ( couple )-posture appears from the 2nd century B. C. onwards, there is clear indication of a mithuna as early as the 3rd century B. C. on a Rupar seal, wherein we see a nude goddess with a male figure.3 The male figure is shown away from the nude goddess trying to offer her something; but, in the left corner we see a man and a woman holding some object on a plate between them. Terracotta couples have been found in the second century B. C. from Mathura and Rajgir, and also from Tamluk and other places. In one instance, the terracotta-couple ( which is from Chandraketugarh4 and may be placed about the 2nd century B. C. ) acutely resembles the couple from the Lingaraj temple,5 Bhuvanesvar, 11th century A. D., wherein the full-sized man in the standing position takes to his middle a woman with thighs astride and in the slightly uttänapäda position, both being in the nude 1.

A normal copulative position like this is rather impossible: and it is difficult to reach orgasm in thn position; there should be no doubt, hence, of the pose being a ritual -pose,' especially when it is seen first on the terracotta which appears to have votive value. Kanwar Lai thinks it to indicate a male of the 4 horse ' type and a woman of the e deer ' type, which is not neccssary. 5.

The position in the latter mithuna has been compared with the avalambita rata*; and, probably, rightly so; but it has to be noted that the terracotta mithuna is of an earlier period than the Kämasütra of Vãtsyãyana7, which is the first to codify the erotic science. The same has to be noted in the case of a terracotta orgiastic group from the same place and of the same early period. In this figure, the female-partner of the central couple is in the same thigh-stretch-fixture pose ; there are two female figures by the side of the mithuna.s In the later period, that is about the 12th century A. D., we have the revival of this motif, with the goddess or without her in certain cases. The point to be noted is, that the vipar'ita-rata and the orgiastic group was known prior to the Kämasütra. In one terra- cotta mithuna from Tamluk9 about the same period ( 2nd ct. B. C. ) we have a typical mithuna, in a chair. The nude man is reclining face upwards, with legs stretched down in ease ; and a woman, also nude, is sitting in his middle in a coital fixture, with thighs astride. This position is of the puru~ sãyita type, and is represensed in the later period also, as, for example, in the Bellagavi sculpture10 in Shimoga district of the present Karnataka state ( Tripurãntaka temple, about the 12th ct. A. D. ). In an erotic terracotta couple from Kausãmbi11 we see something like a spacious chair; and the yvoman ( nude ) appears to be sitting on the lap of the man, a well known later motif. The period of the couple is about the same as other terracotta couples mentioned above. In the very first example we have noted above, we have something like a hut covered with leaves ; and very likely, it represented a divine abode or a shrine. The floral motif is also seen in the last example noted ; and it may be compared with the one in the Šalabhaňjkiá, East gate Sanchi, wherein the tree-spirit appears as a nude damsel ( 1st ct. B. C. ).12 Mithunas with the floral motif, or associated with some sort of a depiction of leaves, are found from the 2nd century B. C. onwards ( for ex- ample, the Sudarsanã Yaksï from Bharhut18 shows the lotus overhead, 2nd ct. 6. Vidya Prakash, p 179; cf. Kämasütra II. 6. 36; we may, however, compare the pose described at the âhanasyà verses at the Horse-sacrifice, " hold her up, as if carrying a load on the mountain ", referred to further and with a slightly variant position indi- cated. 7. 2nd et.

D. shows leaves overhead). From Mathura we have an in- teresting sculpture from this point of view, from the 2nd ct. A. D. In a pre- sentation of a gate panel having two sides, joined by a horizontal slab inlaid with a lotus, on the top of one side is seen a couple. The man is seen slightly leaning over the woman, embracing her amorously; his left hand is shown touching an inverted tumbler that stands covering a jar which is held by a nude woman that adorns the full height of the panel. The other part of the panel shows a nude woman, her right hand on her waist and the left hand holding something like a stick. On the top is seen the ( same ) couple, in a semi-embrace as if rousing in the morning.14 The jar appears to symbolize wine, while there is a bunch of mangoes in the right hand of the woman (the Yaksï); these two, together, symbolize the advent of the Spring; and the motif gets to be on par with the floral-leafy one. There is no doubt, hence, that all these mark the advent of the spring season and the creative faculty of the earth. The motif in the terracotta mithunas and the mithuna - scujptures, hence, is the same ; and the psychology behind them should also be the same, which is the gain of prosperity. The difference is, that the terracottas seem to be for common use, while the sculptures were established by royal assistance. The former appear to be for votive offerings15 for prosperity in general; and there is a probability of their being planted in the field for harvest, or offered to the goddess of bounty. Besides the mithunas , we get the terracotta figurines of the nude goddess identified as Šrl, or of the headless one said to be the " shameless woman ".lfl The cult of this goddess was fairly well distributed, as seen from the occurrence of figures at Bhita, Jhusi and Kausãmbi in the Uttar Pradesh, Ter and Nevasa in the Maharashtra and Nãgãrjunakondã in the Andhra Pradesh, in the early centuries of the Christian era. Though the figure is headless, often a lotus is seen in the place of the head. Another headless woman found in Inamgaon, about fifty miles from Poona and to the east, is associated with the bull as her vehicle ;17 she may be compared with the nude goddess with a bull found at Vadgaon in Maharashtra and at Bhinmal in southern Rajasthan.18 It is probable that the bull comes as the zoomorphic male 14.

C., while the single headless woman is assigned the period about 800 B. C. Though it is not easy to establish an evolu- tionary relationship between these two types, the point to remember is the prominent sexual tone of these figures. In the case of the single headless figure, the fertility aspect is clear, and her images are worshipped even today in some places. Barring this figure, the other female figures are shown along with their male partners, as is seen above, the male being a worshipper-priest in certain cases (cf. the Rupar figure), or a zoomorph or the human cohabiting with the female. It is possible to make a difference between the human mithuna on the one hand, and the goddess-human or the goddess-zoo mithuna , on the other. The latter appears to be the divine couple, the priest attaining divinity in rituals, while the former appears to be the votive mithuna , offered to the divinity, in the form of the nude goddess or any other goddess of fertility. The Mahãnagni : Now, it is interesting to see if the Vedic people knew of any such goddess as the nude one noted above. It is difficult to give an exact copy of the goddess in the Vedic pantheon; but even granting the fact of the absence of idol-worship or terracotta offerings in the early Vedic period, the Vedic religion had developed the concept of the " Great naked woman ", the Mahãnagni, as early as the period of the Atharvaveda (AV) some hymns from which are known to form part of the Khila hymns of the R gveda.19 At one place in the A V , Mahãnagni ( another reading is Mahãnaghní, but only at this place ) is alluded to in the mantras in the context of marriage ; and the gods Ašvins are invoked to protect the bride by their power by which they got sprinkled the genitals of Mahãnagni (.4^ XIV. 1, 36 yena mahãnaghnyã jaghanam...abhy* asicyanta). In the same context we have some ritual-detail ; for, along with the genitals of Mahãnaghní, wine and the dice are also referred to have been sprinkled ( Ibid, yena vã surä yena aksã abhy ' asicyanta ). This will indicate that the sprinkling of the genitals of the Mahãnagni, together with the wine and the dice probably formed some sort of a ritual; and, very pr obaly, it was done for prosperity ; it is the ritual- belief of the propitiation of this naked goddess that further entered the ritual of marriage, as a charm for the happy married life for the bride.20 However, the propitiation of Mahãnagni is not exclusively associated with marriage. It was a much wider practice, and was extended to the ritual of 19. Sec Dange, op. cit. pp. 68-82, where other renderings of the word mahãnagni are criticized. 20. Ibid., for dice-playing in Vedic ritual see Vedic Index , under aksa .</page><page sequence="5">DANGE : Sex in Stone and the Vedic Mithuna 547 marriage. The indication is to be found in another context, where we have some more details and a probable ritual. The mantras that refer to Mahânagnï are traditionally incorporated in those that are called ãhanasyãh ; and this term has a peculiar connotation. They symbolized coitus, and their recitation was indicative of the completion of coitus, when actual coitus was substituted by a purely symbolic one.21 There is a slight difference between the mantras of the AV and those from the RV-Khila , but the theme is the same; and we may note the most prominent features thereof : Mahânagnï is told that fi he * is roaring, being unsatisfied ; she should be easy, and lift her thighs ( RV-Khila V. 22.6; AV XX. 136.5 with variant reading ). Mahânagnï strides over the mortar and says, " As do they pound you, so do they mine" (i?FIb. 1 = A V lb. 6). Mahânagnï rinses the "cock" with the wooden peg ( RV lb. 8aĎ = A V Ib. Ib. 10aö mahânagnï krkavãkum iamyayã pari-dhãvati ) ; and now, the singer says that he does not know, " the beast carries the woman by the head !" ( AV lb. 10c^ ayant na vidma , yo mrgah sirsnã barati dhãnikãm ; RV Scd has it as, "This bamboo-stick ( tejanam ) we do not know ; the woman ( dhãnakã ) becomes " endowed with the head " ( ? sirsnã bhavati dhãnakã ). Mahânagnï says, " Well is the membrum virile entered "; of the ' tree having such fruit • may wegain basket after basket" (AV lb. 9 = i? F lb. 5, with the difference that in R V at ab we have " the organ of the horse has entered " ).22 Then we have reference to the male partner of Mahânagnï, who is called Mahâ- nagna. This is what is said : " Mahânagnï runs after Mahänagna, who runs ( or, " ' rinses ' Mahänagna who ť rinses ' her, " dhãvantam anu dhãvatV where the sense seems to be twofold, including the sexual ) ; ( and says ), ' These his cows, protect them ; ' enjoy ' me; ' eat the moist one ' (AV lb. 11 = RV lb. 9) where the sense is clear, and the eating of the "moist one " is to be understood with " enjoy me " (yabha mãm9 addhy ' odanam ), the whole concept being of the sex-act as a charm for the protection of the cows. There are also other references to Mahânagnï in the AV, which do not occur in the AV-Khila : "The sudeva presses you, Mahânagnï!" (Ib. 12a); and "The a-deva presses you, Mahânagnï!" (14a); and at both the places we have, "The dig of the Great is great" (Ibid.0).23 At RV 21. Dange, op. cit ., loc. cit., Ai. Br. VI. 10 ähanasyäda vai retah sicyate . 22. The RV has ašvasya ñveütam pasah; but the AV does not have the word afvasya at all. It has suasâuefitam, and has the variant svastyâvesiam along with others. The word svastya * ãveSitam would mean "entered; hail!" indicating auspiciousness. Probably, this is the original reading: this would also show that the horse was introduced at a later stage, or indicated a variant of this ritual. 23. We may compare the saňghátaka type of Vatsãyana, II. 6. 40, misrikrtasadbhä- yãbhyàúi dvâbhySm saha safighâtakaih ratam ; cf. also v. 41, bahvlbhií ca saha gauyüthikam , also ( Continued on the next page )</page><page sequence="6">548 ABORT : Diamond Jubilee Volume and A V , in the same context, there is mention of the " Great bilva " and the " Great udumbara ". From what we have noted above, the following aspects of Mahãnagní become clear : ( i ) As a single goddess she is the norm for all feminine charm, and is associated, in the mantras, to bless the bride ; ( ii ) It is probable that dice and wine are associated with her as ritual-objects ; but the point is not quite certain ; ( iii ) In the sphere of general fertility, as is indicated by the basket ( actually " winnowing basket surpam šurpam bhajemahi , cf. the places noted above ), she is associated with the sex-act; and there too, the symbol is that of the mortar ( vanaspati ) and the pestle that pounds in it. But there is no clear indi- cation of the mortar being the symbol of a feminine deity in the Vedic ritual, though, among other things, the mortar-pestle form a mithuna ;24 (iv) Mahãnagní has her male counterpart in this aspect, Mahã- nagna; he is described by the tree-symbol (cf. " of the 'tree having such fruit ' idrkphalasya vrksasya ), and is likened to the Bilva and the Udumbara trees;25 his copulation with ( Continued from the last _ page ) 41, 43, where one man and more women, or the reverse is indicated; this obviously, was with a common woman; for sculptures see Kanwar Lai, PI. 89, man flanked by two women; this is from Konark; for a woman and two men see D.

RV. X. 95. 14, and Geldner, Der Rigveda , III. p. 280 ). There is room to believe that here we have a multi-aspect personality of Mahänagm. In the divine aspect she has the divine partner, Mahänagna; in ritual, Mahänagna becomes, or is represented by, the sudeva-adeva on the one hand, and, on the other, the beast. In the former aspect there must be a human ; in the latter a ritual-beast, and it is here that the horse comes in the Horse-sacrifice ; for some of the mantras that precede were actually sung at the Horse-sacrifice ; and, under this later influence can be explained the reading in RV-Khila "the organ of the horse has entered" ( ašvasávešitam pasah ), which we do not have at the AV . The relationship between the " nude goddess ' who has her partner and the Vedic Mahãnagni cannot be exactly established. But the concept behind them is similar. Mahãnagni is undoubtedly the goddess of the procreative faculty; and she is the divine woman par excellence who would give progeny and full womanhood on the one hand, and, on the other, would give full crops; the latter is her aspect of the earth.27 The former may be compared with the custom of applying sindüra to the vagina of the " nude woman " and her worship by women for pro- geny. The concept of Mahãnagni developed in the later Vedic period, for, as said above, there is no reference to her in RV proper. In her zoomorph she ( Continued from the last page ) the Vsmana P. has bilvo laksmyah kare ' bhavat ; the udumbara also has fruits; and it was very auspicious in rituals; a pole from it was used as a support for the sacrificial pendal; Šat.

Br. I. 27 tayãmahã - nagnyä bhütayä somam râjãnam akrinan ). Here Soma is said to be the bull, and Mahanagnï is the cow; they form a mithuna (compare the " nude goddess and the Bull " from Bhinmal ) and she is also said to be speech. Altar-anthropomorphism : Another important aspect of Mahanagnï, though it is not clearly stated, is the sacrificial altar ( vedi ). The Vedic altar was prepared roughly in the form of a woman, and her male was the fire.28 The altar and the earth are mutually identified,29 and, as the earth and Mahanagnï are on par, as noted above, it is very clear that the altar is Mahanagnï. The vedi is described as a young woman, well-adorned, having four kapardas ( dangling intertwined hair, a form of veni , the latter being flowing hair ) and butter- faced, supervising the ritual (RV X. 114.3 catuskapardã yuvatih supeiã ghrtapratlkã . ..); and she is pictured to be attended by the sacrificer and his wife, the main ritual-mithuna, described in a typically sexual term (vrsanä = vrsanau, "the potent sprinklers"). In this connection it is interesting to pay attention to a terracotta-image found in a altar at Kauáãmbí. It has been identified with the goddess Sinívãli,30 the Vedic goddess connected with vegetation and fertility and described as having beautiful kaparda and head-ornaments ( Vãj. Sam. XI. 56 sinívãli sukapardã sukurirä su-opaêã ) ; but, it has to be remembered that Sinívãli is the deity of the first half of the new-moon-day, which is why she is associated with the moon. Hence, it is more proper to take the altar-figurine as the representa- tion of the altar rather than of the Time-goddess - Sinívãli. Incidentally, she may be compared with the goddess Paßcacüdä, popular in various parts of India, and whose terracotta figurines are found from Rupar, Ahicchatra, Mathura, Tamluk, KausãmbI, Chandraketugarh and other places, i. e. from Panjab to Bengal, by about the 2nd century B. C.31 However, Pancacüdä has to be differentiated from the altar-deity from the fact that the latter is said to be all nude but for the sacrificial grass that is strewn to make her partially covered ( at least ! ) before the gods and the priests that sit round her at the time of the sacrifice.32 On the other hand, PaScacüdä is fully 28.

She has, in her head-dress, five ãyudhas ; and it is difficult to identify them with the sacrificial instruments, such as the sphya ( wooden sword ), that are placed in the vedi for ritual-use. Moreover, Pañcacüda does not have her male partner, while the vedi has him in the Fire-god. Thus, Pañcacüda is out of the scope of mithuna. Now, the question is, can we connect the terracotta " nude " and the terracotta mithunas we have seen, with the Vedic ritual-tradition ? Devakula : A close study of the period of the terracottas shows that they become prominent by about the 3rd century B. C., except for the " nude woman " and her prototype which is assigned 1200 B. C. Now, there is hardly any plausible proof to establish the making of idols in the Vedic period proper - from R V through A V to the period of the Brähmanas. But, even so, the Vedic seers' imagination had developed a sense of graphic description, as is seen from that of the vedi; and there are many examples of it.33 Along with this, the concept of the mithuna was a fully developed one, one such example being that of Mahãnagna-Mahãnagní, which is fully exploited later in the ritual of the Horse-sacrifice. The presence of the devakula is first noticed by the end of the Brãhmana period, and by the beginning of the Sütra- period ( 600-200 B. C. ).34 The Vedic sacrifice, with its prominence to the fire, had no other devakula , but had a variety of mithunas : bi-sexual, hetero- sexual and homo-sexual; even the gods formed mithunas in themselves; the instruments and the utensils formed mithunas ; the ingredients in the offer- ings formed mithunas ; the sacrificer's wife formed a mithuna with almost all masculine objects including the gharma vessel and the sacrificial beast ( the most prominent being the Horse and its earlier type the virile monkey, the Vrsãkapi ). Of these mithunas , some were actual, as the Horse and the monkey Vrsãkapi on the one hand and the " wife " ( or a südrä ) on the other. Prajapati himself was believed tobe full of mithunas ;35 and, Praja- pati being only the personification of the sacrifice, the body of the sacrifice was believed to comprise mwiti-mithunas. It is to be taken as a natural consequence, that when the devakula came to be accepted in the Vedic tradition these mithunas should be transferred to its various parts. The actual practice of copulation that was known in the Vedic tradition, now will take place before the devatã of the devakula ; and should form a part of 33. Descriptions of Uças and other gods. 34.

It may be noted that by the period of the devakula , the Vedic Aryans had already reached upto Bengal.37 Varied Postures and Vedic Sex : We have noted above that the terracotta mithunas , in various postures, were found quite early, and that in certain cases they tally with those in the sculptures of quite a late period. As we shall see presently, the mithunas in various involved postures are presented on prominent places in the caves and temples, such as Kãrlã, Kondãnã, Badami (ancient Vãtãpi), Pattadakai ( " The stone of coronation " literally, as the Cãlukyas used this place for this purpose ), Aihole and other places. Various types of mithunas have been noted by scholars, such as man mating with animal, animal mating with a woman, animal mating with a man ; two men mating with one woman, two women with one man; viparîta rata , also called purusãyita ; the oral congress : by man in the case of the woman ( cunnilingus ), by woman in the case of the man ( fellatio ), and by both mutually ; the orgiastic type and 50 on.38 In certain types the copulating couple is being helped by others. Many of these postures are recorded by Vãtsyãyana ; and it is not unlikely that Vätsyäyana's Kämasütra induced many poses ; but the real purpose of depicting them cannot be said to be lessons in erotics. A lot of confusion exists about the main purpose of the mithuna- sculpture, some of the points being : ( i ) To protect the temples from thunder and lightning. But this does not explain the mithunas in well protected caves ; (ii) To attract the common man to the house of God; (iii) To test the student prior to his entry into the realm of the divine etc.39 But none of these have been accepted by all; and, moreover, the existence of the terracottas belie all these opinions. The votive offering of the terracottas ( the probability of which we have noted ) in a particular pose might itself have suggested a particular sex-posture in the Kämasütras, as is the case with the purusãyita 36. The terracottas mentioned above have not been associated with any deva-kula (temple) as such; but, it is also difficult to find and confirm the devakula cites of the ancient period. The early devakulas appear to be part of the dwelling; for example, various deva-sthânas are mentioned in the ašrama of Agastya, Rãm. Aranya, 12. 17-21; these cannot be ť temples ' with brick and of a lasting nature. 37. Baudhãyana Dh. S.I . 1. 14; Vedic Index , under ť vanga*. 38. Vidya Prakash, op . cit. p. 15 Iff; D.

Or, conversely, the votive offerer might have thought of a pose that was typical and already known. At any rate, the poses are prior to the period of Vãtsyãyana ; and, though others like Bãbhravya and Dattaka, whom Vãtsyãyana mentions,40 might be taken as the teachers in this field, it is hardly probable that the votive offerer would have thought of showing his up-to-date and scientific knowledge in his offering. The point is that the treatise-writers might have themselves been indebted to the offerers, though their elaboration on this subject helped the sculptures in the later period ( 10th ct. A. D. ) achieve intricate designs. Fellatio, for example, was present in the 2nd ct. B. C.,41 though in the 9th and the 11th century A. D. it developed varieties. It is not necessary to go into the details of this aspect, as we restrict ourselves to the Vedic period. The main purpose of the enactment of the sex-act was the gain of fertility in the Vedic period, as is the case with many other tribes. The Brãhmana texts, as has been noted, used this motif extensively; and the main strain was to form a procreative mithuna ( mithunam prajananam , at various places ). Two important types in this respect are : the actual coitus between an animal ( horse and the monkey ) and the woman, and between man and a woman. The first was seen in the Brãhmanic Horse-sacrifice ( the monkey-type being lost in the early Vedic period itself),42 and the other was practised in the Mahãvrata. In this connection it is interesting to note a few sculptures from Bellagavi from the Shimoga district of Karnataka.4* In one of these we see, in a panel, a monkey ready to copulate with a 40.

The same name occurs in the Upanisads ( Kausitaki I. 1; Brhadâr . VI. 1.1) and in the Sat. Br. XI. 2. 7. 12 5. 4. 18; also Kausltaki-Br . 26. 4; he seems to be rather unorthodox as he allows the initiates to eat honey forbidden for them, Sat . Br.

( III. 41. 1. IV. 17. 1 ). This would indicate the association of these two with sacrificial ritual; and, if they are also the authorities on the Kãmasãstra, it is not unlikely that ritual-sex would influence their apho- risms; however, their aphorisms regarding Käma are not available. 41.

In the middle are seen a couple of women, one facing to her right to the mithuna in the left corner, the other ( the face is semi-broken ) has her one hand on her vagina ; to her left, and on the right corner of the panel, are two monkeys in a semi-copulative posture, the front one ( who is by the side of the woman ) trying to hold the woman. This type is not seen at other cites, and seems to be peculiar to Bellagavi. The monkey motif, as such, is faintly seen elsewhere,44 but this is unique to this place. Now, it is to be remembered that in the 1st et. B. C. the Sãtavãhanas ruled the southern region of India including Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra; they claimed to be Braãhmanas; Gautamíputra Sãtakarní called himself " the unique Brähmana " ; Šrí Sãtakarní performed two Horse-sacrifices, defeated the Šuňgas and ruled over Malva and other portions of North India.45 In the wake of the practice of mithuna-sculptures then gaining ground, it is only expected that the Sãtavãhanas would give impetus to Vedic themes. The Bellagavi sculptures are said to be of the late medieval period; but the point, probably, requires reconsideration; or, at least, the older influence could not be denied. If this is accepted, the guess is whether they indicate the scene of the Vrsãkapi-Indrãní hymn ( mating of the Monkey and the woman personifying Indrãní ) ? The hymn has also the female monkey Vrsãkapãyí. Interestingly, in another sculpture from the same place we see a horse-like figure mating with a woman, who is lying on her back with legs folded. In a sculpture from Khajurãho ( 10th et. A. D. ) we see an aristocratic person ( King ? ) cohabitting with a mare ( in an obvious reversal of the old theme ).46' In yet another sculpture from Bellagavi47 we have a purusãyita motif in the middle on a cot ; on the left is a standing interwined human mithuna ; and on the right is a standing mithuna , the face of the man is blurred while that of the woman is of a mare. In these sculptures there is no indication of the season, but in another one we have the indication of vegetation. In this sculpture we have the cot on which there is a regular copulation of the humans; on the left a man is having a 44. See Kanwar Lai, op. cit..

At the two sides of this central ram-jackal depiction there are trees with flowers and plantain-trees.48 At a sculpture from the Limboji Mata Temple (Delmel, Dist. Mehsana)49 we have a horse-faced man standing in coitus with a woman in the left corner, while on the right is seen an ascetic in standing copulation with a woman. These scenes cannot be supported from Vätsyäyana's Kämasütra , which only mentions " mating like the animals ",50 and the animals do not mate both on two legs standing like men. Inherent in such sculptures is the idea of symbolic (and not actual ) copulation, as is the case with the Vedic, the belief that certain animals represent the divine virility ( and generally, the sun ). The monkey and the horse clearly figured in the. Vedic rite. The horse-sacrifice was popular in practice and in legends. Writers and sculptors on Erotics were; obviously, influenced by this ritual-sex and added more animals for vaicitrya ( variety ) in the citra-rata , as they termed it. The theme of the Horse-mare divinity is the oldest in the Indian zoomorphism, parallelled only by that of Bull-cow. The Saranyü-Vivasvan myth is an example in this case, of which the later aspect is the Hayagriva- Visnu (horse-headed Visnu) form. In an interesting legend in the Skanda P. (VI. 81.11; 84.15-19), a Brãhmana girl who (unknowingly) sleeps on the bed of Visnu is cursed by Laksmì, in jealousy, to be born mare-faced; but Visnu pacifies Laksmi and it is agreed that the mare-face will be only for one birth, and that in that next birth when she is born with the mare-face she will be the sister of the Krsna- avatãra of Visnu. As she is born thus, Krsna and Balaräma take her to Brahma, who restores her original form, and re-names her as Subhadrã.51 It will be pertinent to note, and appreciate, that Subhadrã comes as a symbolic name in the Horse-sacrifice as the female-mate of the Horse, whom the queen or the ritual-woman is portrayed as substituting or impersonating.52 48.

II. 2. 6 if, for about the same account.</page><page sequence="14">556 ABORI : Diamond Jubilee Volume The " Subhadrã " at the SK. P. noted above is the fertility goddess.®3 Thus, the equation is : Subhadrã = Fertility = mare. This compares also with the mare-king copulation. We may also note that the worship of Subhadrã . is enjoined in the month of Mãgha, and on the 12th day, which comes at about the end of the year and is adjecent to the spring. It was also in the month of Phãlguna ( bright half ) that the Horse-sacrifice was performed. Cases of amimal-coitus, or mixed human-animal coitus in the sculpture need not be referred to the citra-rata of the Kãmaáãstra, where the humans act as animals, but to spring and fertility-rituals such as Mahãvrata, where we have "copulation of creatures" ( Ait. Ãr. V. 1.5 bhutãnãih ca maithu- nam ) where the word bhiitãnãm does not restrict it to one particular type of creatures, but to mixed copulation or purely human or purely animal, the whole idea being of general fructification and fullness of coitus ( cf. prajana' nam ; and mithunasya sarvaívãya ). Supported coitus : One of the most conspicuous motifs in the erotic sculptures is the " supported coitus " ( as in the woman-monkey sculpture at Bellagavi noted above ), where the parties are shown as being helped by others. From this point, it is necessary to view the mantras and the acts at the Horse- sacrifice again. Apart from the fact that there are one hundred maidens of each of the four queens in the event of the sexual ritual of the horse and the queen, as is evinced from the ritual as it appears in the Šatapatha Brãhmana (XIII. 5. 2. 2ff), an earlier ritual indicates a difference, as indicated from the RV-Khila, AV and the Vãj. Sam. : " When the priests in the ' playful mood' pressed the male organ and embraced from all sides the woman, she was visible (only) at the thighs ( as a woman) - " ( Vãj. Sam. XXIII. 29 yad devãso lalãmagum pravistiminam ãviéuh; and Uvata, pravistiminam, pra- vešya vistabhya ca; ãviéuh, ãlingana-cumbanãdibhih nigrhniyuh nãrim). This explains the second type of gauyüthika mentioned by Vãtsyãyana as being current among the Bãhlikas ( II. 6. 43 ) and some of the orgy-types in the sculptures. We have noted earlier that in the mantras ( called ãhanasyãh in the tradition ), the mention of the horse is not uniform (see note 22); and this is supported from the passage noted just above; for, it is rather impossible for the priests ( ! or, actually the men participating in the original folk-ritual) to clutch the ritual-woman when the horse (though ritually killed earlier ) is also in the picture. In the Brãhmana ritual, the horse and the queen are made to lie on a golden disc, and the priests are away, chant- ing the ãhanasyãh, which obviously shows a later version of the ritual. In 53. Skanda P. VI. 84. 18, 19 : yd nârl patina tyaktâ vandhyã vä. . . . bhavisyati suputrãdhyã subhagã vã sukhànvitã.</page><page sequence="15">DANGE : Sex in Stone and the Vedic Mithuna 557 the older version, originally a human couple acted together with other men (cf. deväsah , plural, "ritually divine men"), the woman being, most probably, a prostitute ( a common woman ) ; and the horse came later. The other mantras also indicate the action on the part of the copulating man, rather than an insentient animal. With this detail and the bhütänäm maithunam there should be no doubt that the seed of the orgiastic motif lies in the Vedic period and in the ritual ( which had already drawn upon the then folk-tradition ) of the Spring festival to which the horse was added at the Horse-sacrifice. In most of the orgiastic sculptures a cot with the copulating couple figures in a prominent place,54 in the centre or in a corner. With the mantra noted above we have a clear mention of the cot in the mantras at the Horse-sacrifice ( Ibid. 24, 25 mãtã ca te pitä ca te agram vrksasya adhi-rohatah , where vrksa stands for the cot " made of wood according to the tradition ). The cot could never suit the horse. The dialogues ( with the sexy mantras ) are between the priests and the queens and the other girls ( who speak for the queens, and also with a girl who speaks for herself ). This would mean that the main couple must have been human and different (though it was never shown later, and was indicated only through the mantras ) from those who recite the mantras " your Father and your Mother rise on to the cot " etc. Now let us come to an important detail. Another actual coitus position is as follows ( in addition to the one indicated in the mahämithuna , we might say, on the cot ) : " Cause her to be poised aloft, as one carrying a heavy weight on the mountain ; may her central part widen, as if winnowing( grain ) in the cool wind " ( Ibid. 26 ). The retort of the women to the priest is similar, but with the masculine usage. It has to be noted that this is the position in respect of only one of the four queens. The position has coitus in view; and yet the madhya is to be raised as if one were lifting a heavy weight. This would mean that the man is standing, bending a little; and, in this position, has the coitus-position. How could the woman be ? Not lying on her back ! She has to be raised in such a way that her madhya has to come up to the organ of the man ; and she has to look like a winnowing basket throwing grain out. This could not be, unless she stands with back up with her buttocks to the man who holds the part, and supports her body with her hands and feet, all on the ground. This is the dhainuka55 of the Kämasütra, which is different from 54. Kanwar Lai, PI. 38; 44; 109; D. Desai, PI. 65; 17; 100 etc. 55. The RV indicates certain curious poses in one place, where a young girl is involved; probably she is a ritual gift, and is described as : a-gadhitä and parigadhitä , {Continued on the next page )</page><page sequence="16">558 ABORI : Diamond Jubilee Volume the one noted above. That one was for the Parivrktã queen; this one for the Vãvãta; hence the difference also, in the poses. This would indicate the zeal to show varieties, with the religious belief in profusion through variety leading to greater and varied procreation and prosperity. The dhainuka? 6 with the motif of attendance, and the sanghãtaka , is common in sculptures, where the element of ritual is indicated by the male parties having umbrellas.57 These sculptures cannot be taken as indicating simply aristo- cratic sex-usage ; they have to be taken as the revival of ancient motifs of holy ritual-sex ; and the fact of their being depicted at temples and caves should leave no doubt about it. The Vedic examples noted above testify to the plurality in coitus. That this continued later is indicated by a practice in the Mahãvrata, where we read, " Those who perform the yearly coitus ( sam • vatsaram upayanti ) get devoid of maithuna ; so the two ( the Mãgadha and the prostitute ) sexually unite ; thus, they all do not get devoid of maithuna ( Apastamba S. S XXI. 19. 6 ). This is the continuation of the earlier rite where the two copulated ( Jai . Br . II. 405 mãgadham ca pumšcalim ca daksine vedy 9 ante mithúnikãrayanti, which might indicate the supported coitus ; kärayanti, causal ). The si^ra-passage subtly indicates the old Vedic general practice of multiple posing of coitus in ritual in the spring, and forbids it, allowing only the Mãgadha and the courtesan.57« Earlier, the Kãthaka Sam . (XXXIV. 5) has the plural, "they perform the coitus" ( mithunam caranti)9 which indicates the old Vedic tradition of plural and multiple coitus. There is an interesting indication; and, though nothing certainly can be said about the mode, we may note it. The Brahmacarin at the Mahãvrata abuses the harlot : " Fie upon thee O Puniscali, thou • washer of the male-organ ' ! " ( Drãhyãyana Š. S . XI. 3. 9 purhêcali , purusasya šišna-pranejani ). May it be a bold step to suggest that here we ( Continued from the last page ) which show two different poses, and Sãyana comments that in the first case the initiative is with the man, in the other it is with the woman; if so, is there an indication of the purusâyita here ? The simile is to be noted; how held ? katikti iva; kafikâ is said to be ichneumon (female) or a cat ( Vedic Index). If that be so, does it indicate the citra-rata of the beast -type ?- the norm of which is the dhainuka I She is said to be yädhwn , which is a sexy term, and may be compared with tâdurl , said of the female-frog that is invoked to release rain-waters ( AV IV. 15. 14 ). The female frog here may be compared, in concept, with the Egyptian Frog-goddess called " Baubo " by M. A. Murray, " Female Fertility Figures " J. R« A. I., Vol. 64, 1934; the " Nude Godess " menitoned above has the same posture; see D. Desai, op. cit., fig. on p. 12. 56. KãmàsUtra II. 6. 37 ; gauyüthika is "one with many ; with the dhainuka , i. e. a woman's buttocks to man, cf. RV-khila , V. 22. 3 ,yabhiyamânâ vi namyate , "is curbed like a bamboo while " 57.

XVII. 6. 1.2.</page><page sequence="17">DANGE : Sex in Stone and the Vedic Mithuna 559 have an indication of the fellatio, so common in sculptures? We have noted that this motif was known also in the 2nd ct. B. C. ( on the terra- cottas of Chandraketugarh ), and later got popular in the 9th cent. A. D. and later. The point is, how could a woman " wash " the male-organ. Not in coitus proper. There is no indication of, and propriety of, water; and yet she " washes The surmise of " mouth-wash " cannot be avoided. The Kämasütra censured this practice, which indicates that it was prevalent in its time. As we have noted, the period of the Sutras is from- 600 to 200 B. C., which corresponds to the terracotta noted above. It is not improba- ble that the Sutra period employed this practice in the Mahãvrata ; but the erotic treatise, which copied others from the ritual, censured it. The erotic sculptures innovated many things; but, the main source seems to be Vedic rituals, which were themselves influenced by folk-customs of sexy songs and rituals. The Indian erotic sculptures show the innovation of many details that answer also the development of art. But the motif of sanctified sex goes to the Vedic period, with the simple mithunas formed from the various sacrificial ingredients accompanied by the ritual-coitus varieties. In the later period the mithunas adorned temple-gates and various other places, in a variety of poses, miniature and huge, the Šakta-cult also adding to the themes. Tantric influence may not be denied; but, it should be borne in mind that Tantric practices never allowed open depiction of coitus for fear of complete ruin.58 Moreover, it has to be remembered that in hardly any sculpture do we have presentation of any other ma-kãra out of the five, than maithuna ; nor are there any Tantric designs, though they were certainly known by the 10th century A. D. About the Šákta motif of close embrace, and the Ardhanãrisvara, which is seen from about the third century A. D. or even slightly earlier,59 it may be pointed out that the motif imitates the Indra-Indrãní motif ( or, actually the ' Man-in-the-eye motif, one of the men being the woman) that had already developed in the Brähmana period.60 This may be taken to be the germ of the Yogic concept of dualism 58. See note 23 above. Vidya Prakash suggests some of the poses to be Tantrik ( op, cit . p. 186 ) ; so does Kanwar Lai, though his approach is not studious ( p. 89 ) ; D. Desai believes that Tantrism was one of the major factors in the case of the depiction of orgiastic maithuna (p. 145 ), and yet the depiction of sex, in her opinion, was not of the pure Tantric nature; they were fake Tantric for worldly gain (p. 201 ). 59.

The depiction of the mithuna in design, as different from the act in ritual, is already known from the A V and the other Vedic texts; and this was for the growth of the cattle. Mithunas of this type were carved out on the ears of the cows by means of a heated blade.62 These were not poses involving maithuna, for there is no evidence to that effect; but they may be compared with the simple mithunas that adorn shrines and even the orthodox Hínayãna Buddhistic caves, which only shows the popular belief in the efficacy of the mithuna- figures. We have, rather, an interesting reference to one god flanked by two goddesses in the RV, where it is said that Indra holds Heaven and Earth as the god Bhaga holds two auspicious girls.63 Whether this indicates a pictorial design is not clearly attested, but it gives an idea of a variant mithuna , and has subtle parallel ( sanghãtaka) in stone.64 61. This pose is not attested by the KãmasUtra ; we may compare the yava-yuma poses, where Živa and Šakti are shown in close coitus, a furtherance of the dlingana pose ( for example the Hevajra and the Sakti, nude embrace ; P. Thomas, Incredible India , PI. 98); the idea comes close to the Chinese Yang- Yin complex, which was introduced by Wang Gh 'ung by the Ist ct. A. D., and was represented in a figure ( a circle divided by a reverse S -sign and the two half figures now appearing like two tailed creatures, the face of one to the tail of the other, with a dot for the eye ) by Chu Tun by the 11 et.
