<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Upstairs / Downstairs 99* Surgeon Vice-Admiral Sir John Rawlins Chairman of the Board, Deep Ocean Engineering, Inc. Summary This paper draws attention to some common physiological and human factors prob lems in diving and submarine operations on one hand, and in aviation and space operations on the other, and illustrates the application of underwater techniques to solve aviation problems and visa versa. It is largely a personal account of work carried out by the author and his colleagues during 33 years of service in the medical branch of the Royal Navy. Introduction When I tell people that I switched from aviation medicine to underwater medicine the usual comment is, "Well, it's all a matter of pressure, isn't it?" Actually, it's a bit more than that. The problem of hypoxia in flight was first starkly demonstrated by the deaths of the French balloonists, Sivel and Croce Spinelli, during their balloon ascent to 20,200 ft in 1875, and here hypoxia was a direct result of the diminished atmospheric pressure. In diving, there is always an increase in ambient pressure, but hypoxia is much more common amongst divers than amongst aviators. Particularly at risk are breath-hold divers such as the Ama, the famous diving women of Korea and Japan, and snorkel divers. Experienced breath-hold divers, however, can go to astonishing depths. Jaques Mayol, at the age of 35, baffled physiologists by making a world record breath-hold dive to 97 m. Last year, at the age of 55, he extended the record to 105 m! Military divers and commercial divers, who use artificial mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen, or oxygen and helium, are also liable to hypoxia if the oxygen partial pressure in the breathing mixture is allowed, for one reason or another, to fall too low. So here we have hypoxia, a common hazard for both divers and aviators, often, but not nec essarily, related to a fall in the ambient pressure. *A more complete version of this paper was published as: Rawlins, J. 1985.

Haldane, whose sterling work on the first and second Admiralty Deep Diving Committees established the principal of decompression em ployed by today's commercial and sport divers, predicted that the "bends" that plagued divers and caisson workers could occur in high altitude flight. The RAF medical hierarchy, however, did not believe him on the grounds that the pressure changes in flight were too small, and in any case the aviator always returned to maximum pressure, that is to say, ground level, which for the diver represents minimum pressure. Hence, although much work was done between Wars on hypoxia and means to prevent it, no work was done in England on what is now universally known as "decompression sickness." The latter term was coined by Dr. (now Sir Bryan) Matthews, Head of the Royal Air Force Physiological Laboratory throughout World War II. He and his colleagues set about proving to the Royal Air Force that high altitude flight could induce de compression sickness by exposing themselves repeatedly to low pressures in the de compression chamber at Farnborough. In a series of horrendous experiments which would never be permitted today, they experienced a whole range of symptoms of decompression sickness. It is remarkable that no one died or suffered permanent paralysis—such cases have happened since—but they proved their point. It was many years, however, before the threat of high altitude decompression sickness was finally overcome by the development of reliable pressure cabins. In view of the official RAF attitude to decompression sickness, it may seem surprising that a pressure suit was designed by the diving company Siebe Gorman in 1934 for an American balloonist, which was subsequently used by Flight Lieutenant Adams in a flight to the record altitude of 54,000 ft in 1937. Presumably the purpose of the suit was to provide an adequate partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs of the pilot, rather than to protect him against decompression sickness, although of course it did this as well. It is said that Siebe Gorman easily achieved the suit by adapting a self-contained diving dress. This was no doubt true in terms of material and method of fabrication, but it should be remembered that the Siebe Gorman diving dress was flexible, and not designed to cope with a pressure differential. The suit worn by Flight Lieutenant Adams was more comparable in principle to the armoured diving dress, Jim, which is designed to isolate its operator from ambient pressure. At the other end of the pressure spectrum is the lunar landing suit worn by Neil Armstrong. When the Royal Navy invited me to rejoin in 1951, part of the inducement was the promise of an immediate posting to the Royal Air Force Institute of Aviation Medicine where, they said, there would be workshop facilities where I could build diving ap paratus to my heart's content. The bait was irresistible and I swallowed it hook, line, and sinker. I never dreamed that I would have occasion to use my knowledge and love of diving in pursuit of official aviation medicine objectives. Underwater Escape The pages of my scrap book revive memories of two incidents that changed the course of my life and had profound consequences concerning certain aspects of aviation safety. One concerns the first Scimitar aircraft to land on an aircraft carrier, an ap xiv</page><page sequence="3">parently perfect landing with subsequent roll up on the deck—and over the side. The pilot went down with the plane. The other was an accident when another Naval aircraft crashed into the sea from a carrier. The pilot, Lt. Bruce McFarlane, said that when his aircraft hit the sea, he was paralyzed with fright and could only move his right arm. With it he pulled the canopy jettison lever and then the blind of his ejection seat, and eventually found himself on the surface, in the wake of the carrier, safe and sound. At the time the Royal Navy was losing 10 air crew a year in what seemed to be survivable crashes into the water; the United States Navy was losing 50. I was given the task of investigating the problems of escape from a sinking aircraft, and of finding out whether it might be possible to use the ejection seat as a means of underwater escape. After discussions with experts in the Navy on the matter, the conclusion we reached was that the use of the ejection seat for escape from submerged aircraft was not feasible. It was on the very next day that McFarlane successfully used his. Investigations continued using the Admiralty Hydro Ballistics Research Establish ment, where there was a million gallon tank, 120 ft long, 30 ft wide and 40 ft deep with one side constructed entirely of windows of armoured glass. We carried out a series of trials with a Scimitar fuselage in this tank, and subsequently with other aircraft types, to try to assess just how difficult it was to escape from a sinking aircraft. To this end a series of underwater firings were made in a boxed-off end of the tank at Farnborough. It soon became apparent that McFarlane had been extremely lucky. The standard firing mechanism simply would not fire if the seat were submerged. We concluded that in McFarlane's case, the canopy had unlocked, but had failed to come off. This had kept the firing head of the ejection gun dry, but only the primary cartridge had fired. That had been just sufficient to push the canopy off, so that the seat was able to clear the aircraft. The challenge was to make the seat fire reliably underwater. This meant investigating four variables: acceleration, blast, pressure change, and drag. We looked at drag first. We constructed a metal trapeze with two bars, one for the subject to hang on to, the other to brace his feet against. The trapeze lay on the bottom of a 30 ft testing lake at Portsmouth, and was connected to a Jaguar car driven by a racing driver. The subject, wearing oxygen breathing apparatus, clung to the trapeze for dear life as the Jaguar accelerated from a standing start along the tow path. With the Jaguar moving at 30 mph, it proved possible to cling on for about 20 seconds. The problem of having the face piece swept off was cured by putting a polythene bag over one's head. The drag forces were thus proven acceptable. Next came the problems associated with blast. After finding a satisfactory way to waterproof the firing mechanism and conducting a succession of runs with dummies to obtain measurements of blast, ac celeration, and velocity, we decided to try the procedure on a real person. For the dummy, progressive increases in the amount of cordite were used, from an initial 250 grains to the full charge for the Mark II gun being used—1500 grains. For the real person, 1500 grains were used on the first try. The ride was certainly memorable. The explosions of the primary and secondary cartridges were felt rather than heard. One was aware of a great pressure on the body, and particularly the arms, due to the drag. I believe I lost consciousness momentarily, for the high speed films showed that my hands were torn from the handle of the blind of the ejection seat, although I had no recollection of the fact. On arrival at the surface, there were no after effects other than feeling a little dazed. The next subject's expe rience was similar to my own. We were then instructed by the Director of Naval Air Warfare not to proceed with further live tests.</page><page sequence="4">By 1950, ejection seats were being used that had more powerful cartridges (2300 grains of cordite) and a peak velocity through the water of 34 ft per second. The peak g was 7.7. Investigations began concerning the feasibility of underwater ejection with these seats, and permission was obtained to proceed with further live tests. The experience of being accelerated through the water at up to 7.7 g, exposed to a blast from 2,300 grains of cordite and subjected to Q-forces of the order of 7 pounds per square inch (equivalent to 600 mph through the air) virtually overwhelmed the senses. Yet, a pilot subjected to such circumstances still had to keep enough presence of mind to be able to release from his seat and parachute and inflate his life jacket. For several years I had been working on a somewhat different approach, a method of ejecting the seat by releasing compressed air into the seat gun. The air supply was used to inflate a bag in the back of the seat in order to push the ejected subject out of his seat and inflate his life jacket. At the surface, an automatic dinghy inflated around the pilot. By 1962 this system had been perfected and a series of escapes were carried out from submerged aircraft. Other problems had to be solved, including determining how fast an aircraft would sink if downed in the ocean. We concluded that the easiest way to determine a craft's sink-rate was to sink it. Accordingly, several kinds of planes, including a Scimitar, were dropped repeatedly into the sea and were tracked with special underwater cam eras. These studies made it possible to predict the sink rates for aircraft of various configurations and weights. In final tests with the underwater escape system, a Scimitar was catapulted from the deck of HMS Centaur, and in due course, an undamaged dummy pilot, with inflated life-jacket, arrived at the surface. New aircraft required modified designs involving a much more powerful seat injection gun. The much increased blast meant further testing to see what the effects would be. I undertook this test after trials that convinced me that it could be done safely. The blast was impressive and sheared 24 quarter inch bolts supporting the back of the test seat. After effects were minimal, but subsequent trials using sheep indicated that I had been fortunate. We concluded that underwater ejection with this gun was not feasible. Q-force Investigation Water is more than 800 times denser than air, so that a velocity through the water of 34 ft per second is equivalent in terms of drag and Q-force to velocity through air of almost 90 ft per second or 600 mph. The Q-force in both instances would be about 7 psi. My colleague, Captain E. L. Beckman, an Exchange Medical Officer at the Institute of Aviation Medicine, thought that driving a subject through the water at velocities of up to 22 mph would be equivalent to ejecting him into air-blast at 600 mph, but the effects on the body and the evaluation of restraint systems could be carried out in a much more controlled way under water. At 22 mph, the separation force tending to push the legs apart proved to be 300 pounds. The general sensation was described as "swamping the senses." It was determined that the limit of tolerance to ram pressure had been reached. We have here the first instance of an underwater technique being applied directly to a solution of an aviation problem. There were to be others.</page><page sequence="5">The Break Off Phenomenon About this time reports were coming in of Canberra pilots flying at altitudes in excess of 40,000 ft who experienced a feeling of dissociation, described as "flying the aircraft but not being in it." There was total silence in the cockpit. All gauges were steady. The sky ahead and above was a uniform dark blue. Some pilots felt very apprehensive, and the condition became known as the "break-off phenomenon." At the same time there were reports of the Russians isolating people in blacked-out, sound-proofed rooms, as an aid to brain-washing. Dr. Michael Bennett of the Institute of Aviation Medicine and I thought these examples of reduction of the sensory environment had something in common. We decided to produce the most complete reduction of the environment possible. An underwater breathing apparatus was designed such that a subject could be floated underwater at a temperature of 93 degrees Farenheit with a silent gas supply, so that the subject could hear nothing, see nothing, and feel nothing—a sort of back-to-the womb experience. Twenty one subjects found the experience delightfully relaxing and invariably fell asleep sooner or later. However, two became extremely disturbed within 10 minutes, fought their way up out of the water and remained hypomanic for the next 12 hours. Both were convinced that we had been playing tricks with them. One was certain that we were draining the water from the pool and the other that we were spinning him round and round. What had happened? After careful analysis, we concluded that the key factor involved was stress. The 21 contented subjects were divers or individuals who had helped construct the equipment and were totally familiar with it. The two disturbed subjects were doctors who had taken part in many experiments but had never before been underwater, and they were apprehensive from the start. Reduction of the environment per se is not frightening. You do everything you can to achieve it when you go to bed—turn off the radio, turn out the light, pull the pillow over your head to keep out the sound of the church clock striking, tell the other occupant of the bed to shut up and go to sleep. But if you are in bed alone, in a completely dark room, in an empty unfamiliar house, and you wake up and hear the slightest inexplicable noise, your pulse races, your blood pressure elevates, and you are afraid. Isolation per se is not frightening. Isolation plus stress is a different matter altogether. Although the physical conditions remain the same, familiarity with the environment soon dispelled the apprehension of high altitude flight and the illusions that went with the "break off phenomenon." Diver Heating Systems In 1962, Mr. D. Burton of the Royal Aircraft Establishment addressed the annual meeting of Flying Personnel Medical Officers on a liquid-conditioned garment for the provision of aircrew cooling. His presentation went over like the proverbial lead bal loon. The Institute of Aviation Medicine had been working for years on air-ventilated suits and were not about to be convinced that a liquid-conditioned suit might be a better idea.</page><page sequence="6">Captain Beckman by now was back in the United States working on an underwater habitat programme called Sealab II. He was trying to find a way of keeping the divers warm and I suggested that the rejected Burton suit might be the answer by circulating hot water in it. I had no idea how much heat might be required but on the basis that it was designed for 300 W of cooling I suggested that he might start by using 300 W of heating. The U.S. Navy apparently took this as gospel because in 1968 when I was working there on the Sealab III project, there was a quarter million dollar nuclear isotope heater, designed to deliver 300 W to a liquid-conditioned suit from a plutonium 238 micro-reactor. I was the only person who ever swam this system which was beau tifully fabricated in stainless steel and delivered all its heat to the ambient water and circulated the resulting four degree Centigrade water most efficiently. As a result it acted in the manner of a personal refrigeration plant and in addition delivered a not inconsiderable dose of neutrons and gamma rays! By 1965, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had built their own version of the Burton suit, the Apollo suit, which was used as a cooling garment for the lunar landings. Today, my company, Diving Unlimited International, Inc., markets a similar design of garment for maintaining thermal balance in commercial divers operating from lock-out submersibles. We have here a fine example of what I have referred to as Upstairs/Downstairs. Movement Control If you sit in a chair and touch a target with a pencil a few times, then shut your eyes and try to hit the same point, you will normally come within a radius of Vi inch. When I tried this underwater, my blind touches were six inches above this target. What this illustrates is that the strain receptors in the tendons learn the force patterns required of the muscles to touch the intended spot, and in so doing, they automatically take account of the support required from the anti-gravity muscles. When the test is repeated underwater, the arm becomes virtually weightless and the anti-gravity muscles have nothing to do. But the central computer in the brain, which has been accustomed over a life time to counteract gravity, is temporarily deceived, and the combined result of support from the water and customary contraction of the anti-gravity muscles is to place the hand higher than the subject intended. This un derstanding of the customary role of the anti-gravity muscles has an important bearing on the problems of working in space. Early attempts to simulate lunar gravity involved partially suspending objects by an arrangement of wires somewhat similar to that employed in training circus riders. Subsequent experience on the moon showed that quite good simulation had been achieved. Later, parabolic aircraft flights were used to provide temporary weightlessness and trainee astronauts, in full space gear, endeavored to perform simple maneuvers such as climbing steps or recovering from a supine position. These efforts were hilarious to watch but no practical progress was made. Today's space-shuttle crews solved the problem by carrying out their training underwater, with a full sized space shuttle mock up submerged in a tank at the Kennedy Space Center.</page><page sequence="7">Applications In Submersible Design The one-man one-atmosphere diving suit, Jim, resembles the suits worn by astronauts in a number of respects. Although designed to withstand great pressure rather than the lack of it, Jim has articulated limbs, self-contained life-support, and is muscle powered, as are space suits. For underwater exploration, several variations on the theme of one-man systems have been developed in the last decade, with a general trend away from anthropomorphic styles. Thrusters have replaced legs for mobility and metal and plastic manipulators have replaced arms operating in metal sleeves. The most ingenious and practical thus far developed is a system called Deep Rover, a machine that combines the advantages of a diving suit (small, agile, portable) with those of a larger submersible (space to change clothes, carry supplies and instruments, life support for a week). Deep Rover can descend to 1 kilometer in its Mark I form; a deeper version will ultimately go to 10 kilometers. The pilot sits within a clear acrylic sphere in a comfortable aircraft-style seat and controls movements of the sub through subtle motions of his forearm. Muscle-powered metal sleeves have given way to two sensory manipulators that simulate touch, force, and motion, can be controlled to within .03 mm, and can lift more than 200 pounds each. Discussions are underway concerning the possibility of adapting a design resembling Deep Rover for use in space, not replacing present systems, but complementing them with a different approach that already has proven to be valuable in numerous appli cations subsea. Designer of Deep Rover, Graham Hawkes, has advised me that a manipulator closely resembling one of Deep Rover's arms, soon will be delivered to NASA for Space Station applications. This is a clear example of something developed for applications "downstairs" now being adapted for use "upstairs." Conclusion In conclusion, we have looked at some common human factors in high altitude flight and in deep penetration into the ocean. A practical knowledge of diving can be useful for one engaged in aviation and space research, just as a knowledge of the latter is of advantage in research into diving and submarine operations.</page></plain_text>
