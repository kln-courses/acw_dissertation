Through two examples of complex learning systems, we explore some of the possible contributions of complexity science to discussions of the teaching of mathematics. We focus on two matters in particular: the use of the vocabulary of complexity in the redescription of mathematical commu- nities and the application of principles of complexity to the teaching of mathematics. Through the course of this writing, we attempt to highlight compatible and comple- mentary discussions that are already represented in the mathematics education liter- ature. Key Words: Classroom interaction; Cognitive theory; Knowledge; Learning; Teaching practice Early in 2000, Stephen Hawking commented, "I think the next century will be the century of complexity" (Chui, 2000, p. 29A). Hawking's remark was in specific reference to the field of complexity science, which, as a coherent branch of scien- tific inquiry, has only come together over the past 30 years. It is not strictly correct to identify complexity science as a branch of inquiry. Unlike the analytic science of the Enlightenment, complexity science is defined more in terms of its objects of study than its modes of investigation. It first arose in the confluence of several areas of research-including cybernetics, systems theory, artificial intelligence, and nonlinear dynamics-many of which had begun to appear in the physical sciences in the mid-20th century. More recently, certain research emphases in the social sciences have come to be included under the rubric of complexity. In one popular account of the emergence of the field, Waldrop (1992) introduces the diverse interests and the diffuse origins of complexity science through a list that includes such disparate events as the collapse of the Soviet Union, trends in a stock The research reported in this article was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) through Grants #410-2000-0224 and #410-2001-0500.

Pirie, Jo Towers, and Lyndon Martin for the conversations that triggered and helped to inform this writing.</page><page sequence="2">138 Understanding Learning Systems market, the rise of life on Earth, the evolution of the eye, and the emergence of mind. Elsewhere the list has been extended to include any phenomenon that might be described in terms of a living system-including, in terms of immediate human interest, such levels of organization as the cell, bodily organs, the person, various social structures, an economy, a culture, and an ecosystem (Johnson, 2001). Two key qualities are used to identify such complex phenomena. First, each of these phenomena is adaptive. That is, a complex system can change its own structure and as such is better described in terms of Darwinian evolution than Newtonian mechanics. Second, a complex phenomenon is emergent, meaning that it is composed of and arises in the co-implicated activities of individual agents. In effect, a complex system is not just the sum of its parts, but the product of the parts and their interactions. Complexity scientists (or "complexivists") often describe such adaptive, self-organizing phenomena as learning systems (Capra, 2002; Johnson, 2001), where learning is understood in terms of ongoing, recursively elaborative adaptations through which systems maintain their coherences within their dynamic circumstances. Our intention in this article is to present some preliminary thoughts on the possible contributions of complexity science to discussions of mathematics learning and teaching. Our main thesis is that mathematics classes are adaptive and self-orga- nizing complex systems-a suggestion that we regard as complementary to several strands of current discussion in the mathematics education research literature. In particular, some key principles of complexity are prominently represented within such theoretical perspectives as radical constructivism, situated learning, enac- tivism, and some versions of social constructivism. Our discussion proceeds as follows: First, because it is not well represented in the current literature, we begin with a brief introduction to complexity science. We use this account to frame a preliminary discussion of compatibilities and correspondences between research into complexity and research in mathematics education. We then discuss several key conditions that must be present for a complex system to emerge. This section of the article is divided into two parts. We begin with a description of the spontaneous emergence of a mathematical community among a group of secondary school teachers and use this example to introduce and illustrate five neces- sary conditions for complex systems. We follow this description with a report on a more deliberate effort to enact principles of complexity science within a mathematics classroom. Here we revisit each of the five principles in an examination of their possible contributions to the project of school mathematics. COMPLEXITY SCIENCE One way to explain what is meant by complexity within complexity science is to contrast the terms complex and not-complex. Weaver (1948) was among the first to draw such a distinction in an article that has come to be regarded by many as seminal to the field. In rather broad brushstrokes, he sketched out three categories of phenomena that are of interest to modern science.</page><page sequence="3">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 139 The first category in Weaver's analysis is simple systems. Such systems are deter- minate and tend to involve only a few interacting objects or variables. Examples include trajectories, orbits, and billiard ball collisions-in effect, the sorts of phenomena that were of central interest to Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and other Enlightenment thinkers. The analytic methods that they developed, in particular Newtonian mechanics, continue to be the principal means to examine and manip- ulate simple systems. In brief, for a simple system, actions and interactions of each part can be characterized in detail and the behavior of the system can be predicted with great precision. As Newton himself recognized, however, the mathematical tools used to analyze the behaviors of, and interactions within, simple systems can give rise to intractable calculations when the number of interacting components increases only slightly. In the 19th century, as scholars met up with more and more such phenomena, new analytic methods based on probability and statistics were developed. These methods were useful for the interpretation of instances of, as Weaver (1948) dubbed them, disorganized complex systems-situations such as astronomical phenomena, magnetism, and weather that might involve millions of variables or parts. (As devel- oped below, disorganized complex systems are not complex in terms of current usage.) Significantly, the development of statistical and probabilistic methods represented more a resignation than a shift in thinking. That is, statistical methods did not arise from or prompt a change in the fundamental assumption that phenomena are deter- minate and reducible to the sums of their parts. The universe was still understood as pregiven and determined by unchanging laws. The new tools were understood to provide only a veneer of interpretation, one that humans were compelled to impose on a universe owing to perceptual and conceptual limitations. Laplace (1951) summed up the underlying sensibility at the close of the 18th century: Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all forces by which nature is animated and the respective situations of the beings which compose it-an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analyses-it would embrace in the same formula the movements of the greatest bodies and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future as the past, would be present to its eyes. (p. 3) The move to statistical methods, then, was an acknowledgement that no flesh-based intelligence was sufficiently vast. The more intricate and complicated the phenom- enon, the more one was compelled to rely on descriptions of gross patterns rather than analyses of interacting factors. Weaver noted that these two categories-simple systems and disorganized complex systems-do not cover the full range of possibility. In both cases, the systems are mechanical or, in the terms of cyberneticist von Foerster, "trivial" (1981, p. 201). Simple systems can be understood in terms of their inputs and outputs, since their operations remain constant. However, many events and systems emerge in the interactions of agents that are themselves dynamic and adaptive. These nontrivial systems change their own operations through operating. Such</page><page sequence="4">140 Understanding Learning Systems phenomena are not entirely predictable, as they have capacities to respond in different ways to the same sorts of influences. More significantly, they can learn new responses. Candidates for such systems range from the level of microor- ganism through the biosphere and include several layers of phenomena that are of particular relevance to discussions of formal education: brain function, individual sense-making, mind, social collectives, and culture. Such phenomena do not readily submit to analytic methods based in Newtonian mechanics or statistical regression. As Weaver (1948) noted, The problems, as contrasted with the disorganized situation with which statis- tics can cope, show the essential feature of organization. We will therefore refer to this group of problems as those of organized complexity. (p. 66, emphasis added) Since Weaver's formulation, the terms disorganized complexity and organized complexity have been replaced by the terms complicated and complex. As Waldrop (1992) develops, the term complicated is used among the complexity sciences to refer to mechanical events, and thus includes both simple and disorganized complex systems. The term complex, in the contemporary frame, corresponds to what Weaver described as organized complexity. In terms more recently adopted within the field, complexity science is interested in events of emergence'--that is, in those instances when coherent collectives arise through the co-specifying activities of individuals. Discussions of emergence are often accompanied by such illustrative examples as the flocking of sandpipers, the spread of ideas, or the unfolding of cultural collectives. These sorts of self-maintaining phenomena transcend their parts-that is, they present collective possibilities that are not represented in any of the individual agents. Moreover, such self-maintenance can arise and evolve without intentions, plans, or leaders. They are instances of orderfor free (Kauffman, 1995). This quality of transcendent collectivity is useful for drawing a distinction between analytic science and complexity science. Complexity is not just another category of phenomena, but an acknowledgement that some phenomena are not deterministic and cannot be understood strictly through means of analysis (i.e., liter- ally, by taking apart or cutting up). A different attitude is required for their study, one that makes it possible to attend to their ever-shifting characters and that enables researchers to regard such systems, all at once, as coherent unities, as collec- tions of coherent unities, and (likely) as agents within grander unities. 1 In this sentence (and in several others), we deliberately violate a rule of expression that is imposed on much of academic discourse-namely, the avoidance of anthropomorphic expressions (see, e.g., The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, 2001, pp. 38-39). Individual human qualities and intentions are not to be applied or ascribed to nonhuman, subhuman, or superhuman events. Such categories, however, are blurred in the nested logics and organizations of complex phenomena. As the mathematician Paulos (1998) notes, in reference to the stock market and other instances of complexity, "It might even turn out that we're not always being absurdly anthropomorphic when we tell stories about such systems and their moods" (p. 185).</page><page sequence="5">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 141 Interest in complex phenomena is not new. It has, for example, been represented in Charles Darwin's studies of the evolution of species, Alan Turing's curiosity toward co-evolutions of life-forms and their contexts, Jane Jacobs' characteriza- tions of living (and dying) cities, Lynn Margulis's work on symbiotic relationships, Frederich Engel's discussion of social collectives, Niklas Luhmann' s studies of self- organizing and self-maintaining social systems, and Humberto Maturana's and Francisco Varela's research into autopoesis (see Capra, 1996; Casti, 1994; Johnson 2001; Kelly, 1995; and Waldrop 1992 for discussions of these and other historical examples). In fact, as Dewey (1910) noted, by the turn of the 20th century many researchers across the physical and social sciences had already embraced Darwinian processes to make sense of their objects of inquiry. The processes of Darwinian evolution, however, are not sufficient to account for the emergence of complexity. A more recent realization is that the phenomena of self-organization is also vital. For reasons that are not fully understood, under certain circumstances agents can spontaneously cohere into functional collec- tives-that is, they can come together into unities that have integrities and poten- tialities that are not represented by the individual agents themselves. These events of self-organization might be further described as "bottom-up," as emergent macrobehaviors (i.e., collective characters, transcendent capacities, etc.) arise through localized rules and behaviors of individual agents, not through the impo- sition of top-down instructions.2 In this regard, complexity science is an example of the very phenomenon it aims to understand: the emergence of more complex possibilities through some sort of boot-strapping processes. Through most of its history, complexity science has been focused on efforts to better understand self-organization, mainly through close observations of complex systems and through computer modeling. For the most part, this work has been descriptive in nature, as researchers have attempted to identify qualities and conditions that are necessary to self-organization. More recently, however, there has been an increased emphasis among complexivists on the creation and main- tenance of systems that are able to learn. We use this shift in emphasis later to struc- ture our discussions of two mathematical communities in a manner that reflects the recent evolution of complexity science, first focusing on a description of the spontaneous emergence of one collective, then on a deliberate effort to occasion emergence. Prior to that discussion, however, we highlight some important corre- spondences between complexity science and recent research in mathematics education. 2 This suggestion has been a topic of considerable discussion and research among complexity scientists. Johnson (2001) provides a detailed report of the issue, along with several illustrations of phenomena that were once believed to be the result of top-down processes, but which, under close scientific scrutiny, are revealed to be bottom-up--including slime molds, ant colonies, and many social movements.</page><page sequence="6">142 Understanding Learning Systems COMPLEXITY, COGNITION, AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION RESEARCH Over the past 30 years, the emergence of complexity science has paralleled the embrace of new theories of knowing and knowledge among mathematics educa- tion researchers-in particular the development of nonrepresentationist episte- mologies that problematize the deep-seated cultural assumption that learning is a matter of assembling an internal model of an external reality (e.g., Bauersfeld, 1988, 1992; Cobb, Yackel, &amp; Wood, 1992; Confrey, 1995; Steffe &amp; Kieren, 1994; von Glasersfeld, 1995). The two movements are compatible on several counts, including shared emphases on Darwinian evolutionary dynamics and a broader use of biology-based metaphors to describe knowing, knowledge, and other phenomena (see Davis &amp; Sumara, in press, and Varela, 1995, for discussions of these compat- ibilities). Complexity science and contemporary theories of learning, however, are not coterminous. They differ in terms of both their objects of study and the scopes of their assertions. With regard to objects of study, contemporary nonrepresentationist theories of knowing and knowledge tend to be focused on particular phenomena, as opposed to the broad category of phenomena that are addressed under the umbrella of complexity. For instance, radical constructivism follows Piaget in the examination of the individual' s construals of the world (von Glasersfeld, 1995), whereas social constructivist discourses are more likely concerned with some collective phenom- enon, such as the development of a disciplinary subject matter or the emergence of cultural norms (cf. Ernest, 1991). Complexity science, on the other hand, is concerned with a range of nested learning systems, which includes the co-impli- cated processes of individual sense-making and collective knowledge-generation (among other layers of activity that extend at least from the subcellular to the plan- etary).3 We might say that complexity science is more a meta-discourse, useful for reading across theories that are concerned with different levels or aspects of complex nested learning systems. At the same time, complexity science explicitly rejects any attempt to collapse such phenomena into instances, variations, or elaborations of the same thing-as in, for example, attempts to reconcile radical and social constructivist accounts of learning. This is not to say that such phenomena as individual sense-making and collective knowledge-production must be held apart (indeed, they cannot be sepa- rated), but that observers must be attentive to the fact that new possibilities arise and new, emergent rules apply in each case. To extend the example, the dynamics of individual sense-making and collective knowledge-production may be similar and co-implicated, but the phenomena themselves cannot be collapsed into or mapped onto one another---or with any other complex phenomenon. It is thus that a core tenet of the discourse is that complex unities must be studied at the levels of their emer- 3 For a discussion of nested systems see Davis, Sumara, and Luce-Kapler (2000), especially pp. 172-173.</page><page sequence="7">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 143 gence. In brief, complexity science suggests that discourses concerned with different phenomena (such as radical or social constructivism-or neurology, ecology, or biological evolution) can be simultaneously incommensurate with one another and appropriate to their particular research foci (see Rorty, 1981; Sfard, 1998). The assertion that one must not collapse the phenomena that are of interest to neurology, to varied constructivisms, to ecology, and so on should not be taken to suggest that complexivists regard, say, events of individual cognition and events of cultural evolution as well defined and distinct. On the contrary, such instances of complexity are understood in terms of forms nested within forms, not in terms of well-defined regions. For example, the sorts of distinctions that are necessary to study one learner's sense-making (versus learner-in-context, or learner-and- teacher, or learner-as-cultural-agent, etc.) are understood as arbitrary.4 For these reasons, we join with other mathematics education researchers in the suggestion that the field must move beyond efforts to bridge the phenomena of indi- vidual learning and social learning (e.g., Bowers &amp; Nickerson, 2001; Cobb, 1999; Kieren, 2000); that indeed different frameworks are needed. Cobb's (1999) personal research narrative speaks to the movement in the field from radical constructivism to trying to understand the emergent classroom community: In my own case, for example, my colleagues and I initially intended to analyze students' mathematical reasoning in purely psychological terms.... We treated social interaction and discourse as a catalyst for otherwise autonomous mathematical development.... [Incidents]... led us to question our sole reliance on an individualistic, psychological orientation.... Our interest in social norms did not arise as an end in itself. Instead it emerged within the context of developmental research.... It was within this context that we subsequently came to view one aspect of our analysis of classroom norms as inad- equate.... We attempted to address this limitation by shifting our focus to normative aspects of students' activity that are specific to mathematics... [and now there is] the need for a theoretical construct that allows us to talk explicitly about collective math- ematical development. (pp. 7-9) Along similar lines, Bowers and Nickerson (2001) comment: The notion of a collective conceptual orientation can be viewed from a pragmatic level as well as a theoretical one. Most instructors who have taught two sections of the same course can attest to the claim that each class tends to develop its own unique charac- teristics or orientation over the course of a semester. (p. 3, emphasis added) 4 On this count, complexity science might be interpreted to offer critique of an effort to understand mathematics teaching that is not attentive to both the particular contextual conditions and the broader cultural circumstances that give shape to the project of school mathematics. Further, complexity science renders problematic those discourses that focus on peripheries, fringes, border spaces, novices, and other notions that suggest that complex forms might have clear centers, boundaries, and origins. In fact, considerable research has been undertaken to better understand the vital roles played by those agents that are commonly imagined to exist on the edges of complex unities-including, significantly for educators, persons who are popularly classed as novices and initiates. Deacon (1977), for example, provides a detailed discussion of the ongoing contributions of young children to the evolution of the complex form of language. Kelly (1995) details several examples of "fringe groups" and "outliers" that have played key roles in the transformations of social groups, businesses, and cultures.</page><page sequence="8">144 Understanding Learning Systems We have made similar observations, which have prompted us to turn to complexity science as a means to redescribe a classroom collective as a learning system. We suspect, that is, that the tendency to see classroom groupings as unities with personalities is not simply a matter of figurative reference or anthropomor- phism. Rather, for us, this tendency reveals a capacity to recognize events of emergence. In research terms, this move toward understanding the collective as a cognizing agent (as opposed to a collection of cognizing agents) presents some important advantages. Most obviously, the teacher or researcher can actually observe the "thinking" of this agent-that is, the interactions and prompts that trigger new possi- bilities and insights for the collective. Examples of such analyses have been provided by Bauersfeld (1992), Cobb (1999), Kieran (2001), Kieren (2000), Sfard and Kieran (2001), and Zack and Graves (2001) in their discussions of the devel- opments of interaction patterns and the emergences of social norms within math- ematics classrooms, albeit that these discussions are not always framed in terms of the collective cognition of a social grouping. Of particular relevance here is a conceptual shift described by Cobb (1999), away from mathematics as content and toward emergent terms. As he explains, the "content metaphor entails the notion that mathematics is placed in the container of curriculum, which then serves as the primary vehicle for making it accessible to students" (p. 31). By contrast, in his emergent terms, mathematical ideas were "seen to emerge as the collective practices of the classroom community evolved" (p. 31). Cobb further highlights that this perspective is compatible with the view of mathematics as a socially and culturally situated activity. Such analyses and discussions, however, seem to stop short on the matter of the actual identifications of classroom collectives or knowledge domains as learning systems. Social norms, interaction patterns, and mathematical ideas are understood to emerge and evolve, but these phenomena tend to be described on the level of inter- acting agents, not as properties on an emergent unity. In terms of a key principle of complexity science, the notion of self-organization tends not to be taken up in such discussions (Crawford's, 1999, examination of networked mathematical commu- nities-versus hierarchies-is a notable exception). Pragmatically speaking, the addition of the idea of self-organization is critical in the move from descriptions of complex activity to efforts to affect the activities of complex unities-that is, in terms of this discussion, in the shift from descriptions of learning to recommendations for teaching. On this count, complexity science seems to have moved from a focus on description to something more prescriptive (or, perhaps more appropriately, proscrip- tive-this point is developed below). The current emphasis now reaches beyond the question, "What's happening?" to include the question, "How can it be made to happen?" With this shift toward a pragmatics of transformation, we believe that complexity science has become not just a valuable means to interpret, but a source of practical advice to mathematics teachers. To elaborate, much of current work in complexity science is concerned with the articulation of qualities that are necessary to complex systems-that is, the condi-</page><page sequence="9">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 145 tions that must be met in order for agents to come together into collectives that might supersede the possibilities of those agents. In other words, complexity science has become more relevant to such deliberate social projects as schooling. In particular, complexity science has highlighted that, by attending to particular matters, a teacher can greatly increase the likelihood of complex transcendent possibilities within the classroom. We address these sorts of practical issues in the next two sections. CONDITIONS OF COMPLEXITY: THE EMERGENCE OF A MATHEMATICAL COMMUNITY We begin this section with a description of the emergence of a coherent social collective among a group of mathematics teachers that might be characterized as a complex learning system. Through this example, we introduce several condi- tions that were met in this emergent collective, conditions that we will revisit in the final section as we report on a more deliberate effort to prompt the emergence of a mathematical community (i.e., a collective learning system) within a middle school classroom. We came across this first case of complexity by accident, when a teacher asked Simmt, the second author of this article, if she might be able to help with an assign- ment from a university mathematics course that he was taking. By way of back- ground, this teacher and many of his colleagues were taking one of six mathematics courses that the school board requires of all secondary mathematics teachers who had few or no university mathematics courses as part of their undergraduate degrees. Because almost all of the affected teachers have full-time positions, they are limited to taking those few courses that are offered during the evening over the regular term and during compressed summer programs. Each of these options presents problems. The courses that are offered during the school year, for example, often compete with the already heavy demands of teaching. Those that are offered during the summer are often too compressed to support deep appreciations of the topics at hand. With these pressures, many teacher-students-who were oriented by a common purpose, constrained by similar educational histories, and linked by fax machines and other electronic technologies-organized themselves into study groups. At the start of a recent term, one group of teacher-students came together around weekly assignments to share expertise, to collect ideas, and to distribute labor. An early assignment in a geometry course, in particular, prompted many dozens of pages of correspondence among the members of this collective as they discussed patterns, possible relationships among mathematical concepts, hunches, blind alleys and dead ends, and so on. As we already mentioned, we became aware of the collective when Simmt was asked for her help with a geometry question by a teacher acquaintance as he searched for a solution to a particular problem. In helping this teacher with his weekly assignments, she in effect became a part of the collective and as a result</page><page sequence="10">146 Understanding Learning Systems began to learn about how this particular study group had emerged. When the teacher came to her with the question, he also brought records of his attempts to solve the problem, as well as a number of different partial solutions that his class- mates had faxed him. The teacher shared his working papers and class notes with us and talked to us about the assignments and how the teachers worked together to meet the demands of the course. On the basis of these interactions, and an after-the fact analysis of the artifacts, we noticed a few interesting and consistent qualities. One is the nature of the routes that the group tended to take on its way to acceptable solutions. We might describe these paths as meandering or roving. It appears that at moments, the communications among the collective were unoriented and poorly connected; at other moments, they were focused and coherent. At times, important contribu- tions seemed to be bypassed. At other times, minor points triggered major diver- sions. The engagements, that is, bore little resemblance to the well structured arguments that are popularly associated with mathematical thought and progress, tending much more toward the syncopated structures of conversations (cf. Gordon Calvert, 2001). As mathematics education researchers, we became interested in what we viewed as the similarity of these teachers' interactivities and the historical developments of collectives and movements among mathematicians. Recent popular accounts of, for example, chaos theory (Gleick, 1987), complexity science (Johnson, 2001; Waldrop, 1992), and fuzzy logic (MacNeill &amp; Freiberger, 1994), offer descriptions of the unruly histories of a few strands of mathematics inquiry. Such accounts illus- trate the point that, at various times and in varied circumstances, intellectual move- ments can arise spontaneously and may quickly exceed the possibilities of any of their members-at the same time as they provide the conditions for these members to advance their personal understandings and insights. The knowledge is a prop- erty of the collective. These sorts of emergent events within mathematics have several common features, including differentiated participations of contributing agents and uneven, sometimes erratic evolutions--qualities that were also represented in the teachers' learning collective. Notably, the members of these clusters were not only willing but found it necessary to promote and to draw on differentiated areas of expertise, to work with and through several mathematical concepts at the same time, to accept ambiguity and uncertainty, and to make use of analogy and metaphor as much as logical proposition. On the surface, such engagements stand in stark contrast to some of the strategies used to organize students in mathematics classes. For example, group work in which all students are expected to complete the same sets of practice exercises or problems can become settings for individual work, not necessarily spaces for collective action. Significantly, the activities of the teachers' collective and the group-work activ- ities in their classrooms are both oriented by tasks that are selected and imposed by an instructor who is external to the group. The key difference, then, is not who gets to pose the orienting question, but the conditions of engagement with that</page><page sequence="11">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 147 task-a matter that we address presently. Before delving into this analysis, however, we must note two important qualifications. First, the suggestion that a new or tran- scendent unity can emerge from a group of previously disorganized agents is not a claim about a superorganism, a superior consciousness, or a metaphysical event. It is, rather, a statement about expanded possibility that comes about when differ- entiated agents, who operate at a local level with local rules, come together in manners that complement and amplify existent possibilities while opening up others in the space of joint action. In other words, we do not mean to erase or to minimize the activities or insights of individuals as we focus on the activities and insights of the collective. In fact, we argue that an attendance to the collective actu- ally makes space for, and supports the development of, individual students' ideas. A second qualification is that emergent events cannot be caused, but they might be occasioned (Davis, Sumara, &amp; Kieren, 1996; Simmt &amp; Kieren, 1999). A shift in interpretive focus is implicit here, away from what must or should happen toward what might or could happen. Pragmatically speaking, decisions around plan- ning are more about setting boundaries and conditions for activity than about predetermining outcomes and means-proscription rather than prescription. The proscriptive attitude might be stated as "This is what's forbidden; everything else is allowed," which represents a much more open stance than the prescriptive, "'This is what's allowed; everything else is forbidden." Examples of proscriptive situa- tions include most games, social interactions, business dealings, and artistic endeavors. One example of a proscriptive system is the set of "Thou shalt not..." statements in the Ten Commandments. These sorts of examples are framed more by what one must not do than by what one must do. The proscriptions set the bounds on acceptable behavior while they offer the conditions to expand the sphere of the possible. Despite the broad range of phenomena that are captured under the umbrella of complexity, it appears that they all have several features in common. In partic- ular, certain necessary but insufficient conditions must be met in order for systems to arise and maintain their fitness within dynamic contexts-that is, to learn. We focus on five such conditions here (adapted from Bloom, 2000; Casti, 1994; Johnson, 2001; Kelly, 1995; Lewin &amp; Regine, 2000): (a) internal diversity, (b) redundancy, (c) decentralized control, (d) organized randomness, and (e) neighbor interactions. Each of these interdependent conditions is simultaneously a reference to the global properties of a system and to the local activities of agents within a complex system. Such conditions, of course, are not easily pried apart. Indeed, as we have attempted to do so in our considerations of various events, we have found ourselves caught up in tangled cross-references, repetitions, and qualifications. Internal Diversity As we examine some of the artifacts from the communications within the teacher-students' collective, an obvious quality is that members of the community</page><page sequence="12">148 Understanding Learning Systems contributed in very different ways. One person, for instance, interjected with possible courses of action, but there is little evidence that she followed up on her own suggestions. Another's major contribution seemed to be testing out others' suggestions and marking rough spots and blind alleys. One group member had clearly taken on the role of reformulating informally stated contributions in more formal mathematical terms-that is, in terms suitable for submission to the course instructor. One teacher drew on his contacts outside the group to collect sugges- tions and tips. Still another seemed to make few conceptual contributions but was very active in ensuring that information was relayed among participants. Out of such specialized manners of engagement, acceptable responses to the assigned ques- tions were crafted by the collective. In some cases, it was obvious who was most responsible for particular solutions. In other cases, however, the route to a response was not so direct. In one instance, for example, an eventual half-page proof required for a geometry problem was preceded by dozens of pages of faxed and emailed communications among group members-correspondence that was filled will with speculations, cautions, questions, and so on, from all participants. The eventual insight belonged to the community, not to any individual. The intelligent agent, that is, was the collective. In complexity terms, intelligence is an aspect of learning, and is often defined in very similar terms. Johnson (2001), for example, describes intelligence as the capacity of a system to respond not just appropriately, but innovatively to novel circumstances. The extent of a system's intelligence is linked to its range of possible innovations, which in turn is rooted in the diversity represented among its agents. A system's range of possibilities-its intelligence-is thus dependent on, but not necessarily determined by, the variation among and the mutability of its parts. This quality of internal diversity has been used to discuss the importance of, for example, the tremendous amount of unexpressed "junk" DNA in the human genome, the range of vocational competencies among the residents of any large city, the biological diversity of the planet, or the array of specialized functions of different brain regions. In each case, the internal diversity is seen as a source of possible responses to emergent circumstances. For instance, if a pandemic were to strike humanity, previously unexpressed DNA might enable the survival of a few people, and hence the continued existence of the species-an intelligent response to a shift in circumstances. A more intelligent response to the same circumstances (from the perspective of the species, at least) might arise among the interactions of researchers with expertise in such diverse domains as immunology, sociology, entomology, and meteorology. A critical point here is that one cannot specify in advance what sorts of variation will be necessary for appropriately intelligent action, hence the need to ensure the presence of diversity. Our main point here is that the teachers' mathematical collective was an intel- ligent system, enabled by the ranges of interest and expertise among the teacher- students. Significantly, the same manner of describing intelligence can be applied at the level of the cognizing individual. This sort of statement may have a familiar</page><page sequence="13">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 149 ring to those acquainted with radical constructivist discourse. For example, von Glasersfeld's (1995) often-quoted assertion that "cognition serves the subject's organization of the experiential world, not the discovery of an objective reality" (p. 51) might be read as an alternative statement of intelligence as an agent-deter- mined but situation-conditioned phenomenon that is enabled or disabled by the learner's range of experience and interpretative possibility. This similarity should not be surprising, given radical constructivism' s roots in both Piaget' s genetic epis- temology (structured around biological metaphors) and cybernetics (a major trib- utary to complexity science). (There is an important difference, as already noted, in the fact that the radical constructivist discourses do not explicitly address the issue of transcendent emergence.) Internal diversity is also seen as an important quality with situated learning, social constructivism, critical, cultural, ecological, and enactivist theories.' A common thematic to all these discourses is that the viability and adaptability of whatever agent or body is under examination is contingent on that unity's internal diversity. (Even so, in most of these cases, discussions tend to revolve around evolutionary dynamics and not the self-organizing emergence of new orders of complexity.) Of course, such diversity is present in every collective organized around math- ematical study, no matter how homogeneously conceived, including school class- rooms. But we suspect that relatively few such situations can be legitimately described as complex unities in terms of mathematical engagements. By contrast, most classrooms may be appropriately understood as rich examples of complex unities when one considers, for instance, the continuous projects of negotiating posi- tions within the social corpus. Our point is that complexity is always and already present in social groupings. Thrust together into classrooms or other settings, humans self-organize-that is, codes of acceptable activity, group hierarchies, and so on emerge (see Rich Harris, 1998, for a review of research into this phenom- enon among adolescents). Our concern thus becomes how the mathematics teacher might occasion the emergence of a complex collective whose interactions and prod- ucts are mathematical. On this point, we are prompted to offer a critique of those group-based class- room strategies that are organized around formal roles. One cannot impose diver- sity from the top down by naming one person a facilitator, another a recorder, and so on. Diversity cannot be assigned or legislated, it must be assumed-and it must be flexible. A further problem with these formal group-based cooperative strate- gies is that they are often explicitly consensus-oriented, rather than being framed by the fact that the collective might open up more diverse and sometimes novel possibilities. In other words, although such structures can serve to educate indi- 5 Notably, situated learning, social constructivism, critical and cultural theorists, and ecological and enactivist theories use different principal metaphors to frame their discussions-including appren- ticeship, shared labor, power, and knotted webs or networks, respectively. All of these are taken up in ways that project a sense of complex, co-implicative dynamic-albeit that they are applied to different bodies (including the social, epistemic, politic, and biological).</page><page sequence="14">150 Understanding Learning Systems viduals in matters of particular social roles, in complexity terms, they may be no more effective in prompting the emergence of transcendent possibilities than tradi- tional, teacher-centered classroom structures. Redundancy Redundancy is used to refer to duplications and excesses of the sorts of features that are necessary to particular events. For a collective to build a house, for instance, it is not necessary that everyone know how to use a hammer. Such redun- dancy among agents, however, will likely be very useful. Unfortunately, the term tends to be associated with aspects that are unnecessary or superfluous and that contribute to inefficiency. We do not mean to invoke these qualities here, as we frame our discussion in terms of adequate or appropriate activity, not optimality. The sorts of redundancies we discuss are utterly necessary to the emergence of an intelligent collective. When we first became aware of the emergence of the teachers' collective, our attentions were focused on the differences among participants. As we have learned more about the group, it has become clear that an important quality underlying these events of emergence is the complement of variation: similarity. In a phrase, the members of the community were much more the same than different--culturally, professionally, educationally, and so on. Sameness among agents-in background, purpose, and so on-is essential in triggering a transition from a collection of me's to a collective of us. In more technical terms, a system's capacity to maintain coherence is tied to the redundancy expressed among its agents. As demonstrated by the ways that some people's brains recover from strokes, some companies cope with employee disloy- alty, and some ecosystems adapt to the loss or introduction of new species-and, for that matter, the way that the teachers' collective dealt with being stumped- redundancy among agents is an important quality for coping with stress, sudden injury, or other impairments. Redundancy thus plays two key roles. First, it enables interactions among agents. Second, when necessary, it makes it possible for agents to compensate for others' failings. It is in these senses that redundancy is a comple- ment to diversity. Whereas internal diversity is more outward-oriented in that it enables novel actions and possibilities in response to contextual dynamics, internal redundancy is more inward-oriented, enabling the moment-to-moment interactivity of the agents. The importance of redundancy in educational settings was underscored for use during a recent small-scale teaching experiment conducted by Davis, the first author of this article. Five adolescent girls, each identified by a school district as having learning disabilities in mathematics, were engaged in an activity that had been designed to capitalize on their particular interests and strengths. True to the pedagogical intention, each of the learners went off in a different direction with the task. However, when they were invited to present their insights to one another, the interactivity came to a grinding halt. They simply could not effectively commu-</page><page sequence="15">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 151 nicate with one another about what they had done. The creativity of the collective was stifled-not in spite of the internal diversity, but because of it. Inadequate atten- tion was given to such redundant systemic qualities as shared vocabularies, expe- riences, and expectations. The upshot, perhaps obvious, is that educators who are interested in interactivity in the complex collective must attend to the common ground of participants. In the mathematics classroom, such redundancy involves more than shared vocabularies, symbol systems, and resources-all of which were present in the teachers' collec- tive. It also appears that certain commonalities of experience, expectation, and purpose are important. Put differently, it is not enough that participants speak the same language, they must also be languaging the same or compatible experiences. The interplay of such commonality and internal diversity define what Lewin and Regine (2000) call the "zone of creative adaptability" (p. 28), a notion that is remi- niscent of Vygotsky' s (1978) "zone of proximal development." Both ideas are refer- ences to immediate possibilities for co-activity, as conditioned by a certain redun- dancy among agents. The balance of redundancy and diversity among agents--or, in systemic terms, stability and creativity-is not strictly dictated by the system itself. In fact, it is more a function of the stability of the context. Minimal redundancy (i.e., high special- ization) among agents is most valuable in relatively fixed settings, but it contributes to a loss of robustness in the face of sudden change. (Wide-scale extinctions of species are often linked to their overspecialization and consequent inability to adapt to new conditions.) Maximum redundancy (i.e., highly interchangeable agents) is more appropriate to more volatile situations. Increased redundancy does engender decreased diversity, however, and taken to an extreme, a reduction in internal diver- sity can diminish a system's capacity to adapt (see Cohen &amp; Stewart, 1994). The qualities of redundancy and diversity might be used to characterize an important difference between various approaches to the teaching of mathematics. Traditional, whole-class strategies in which all students are provided the same explanations and are expected to complete the same practice exercises in more or less the same way seem to be focused on the establishment of redundancy. A goal in such settings is to ensure that everyone achieves a certain minimal competence within a prescribed set of topics and procedures. By contrast, more student-centered classroom approaches seem to place priority on individual diversity.' However, in both cases, pedagogy is oriented by the assumption that the individual is the locus of learning-an attention that is problematized by complexity science. That is, 6 It is interesting to note that debates around traditional and more progressive teaching approaches have grown more intense as modern societies have been presented with the need to respond more flex- ibly to external conditions, such as environmental degradation, world politics, and global economics. According to complexity science, such contextual circumstances would be expected to prompt shifts in educational emphases toward increased diversity among agents in order to enable more flexible response. By contrast, educational approaches that are oriented toward redundancy would be better fitted to situations in which global circumstances are seen as more stable.</page><page sequence="16">152 Understanding Learning Systems popular enactments of both traditional and contemporary teaching might ignore the complex possibilities of collective engagements as they focus on the qualities of single subjects. Decentralized Control When we compare the interactive structures of the teachers' collective to struc- tures of classrooms, one point of contrast seems to stand out: No one seemed to be in charge of the teachers' community. It organized itself-or, as Varela writes (1999): The whole does behave as a unit and as if there were a coordinating agent present at its center.... [A coherent global pattern] emerges from the activity of simple local components, which seems to be centrally located, but is nowhere to be found, and yet is essential as a level of interaction for the behavior of the whole. (p. 53) Johnson (2001) speculates that the tendency of observers to suspect the existence of a coordinating agent may be rooted in cultural habits of interpreting phenomena in cause-effect rather than complex emergent terms. As it turns out, across studies of complex learning systems, the former seems to be the less powerful of the two when it comes to efforts to prompt or to interpret intelligent behavior, especially with regard to social and cultural collectives (see Buchanan, 2000; Johnson, 2001; Varela, 1987). To our observations, this is also true of the teachers' collective. Simply put, there was no overseer, no director. The collective emerged and sustained itself through shared projects, not through planning or other deliberate management strategies. Another prominent example of this point is provided by current artificial intel- ligence research, where efforts to create massive central processors and core data- bases have given way to projects developed around the parallel linking of small, specialized subsystems that are capable of learning (i.e., of adapting and self-orga- nizing). Although we are still far from achieving the sorts of super intelligence projected by scientists and science fiction writers of the 1950s, considerably more progress has been made in the past decade with this distributed, self-organizational approach than was made in the previous half century with the massive central processor approach (Brooks, 2002; Clark, 1997). Many other examples could be cited. In fact, Kelly (1995) develops his history of complexity science around the slow emergence of the realization that one must relinquish a certain amount of control if complexity is going to happen. In terms of schooling, the notion of decentralized control should be interpreted neither as a condemnation of the teacher-centered classroom nor an endorsement of the student-centered classroom. Rather, it compels us to question an assump- tion that underlies both teacher-centered and learner-centered arguments-namely, that the locus of learning is the individual. Learning occurs on other levels as well, and to appreciate this point one must be clear on the nature of the complex unities that might be desired in the mathematics classroom. For us, these complex unities are shared mathematical ideas, insights, concepts, and understandings that collec-</page><page sequence="17">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 153 tively constitute the body of mathematical knowledge in the classroom. This point is critical to our discussion of the potential contributions of complexity science to mathematics teaching. This suggestion prompts our educational attentions away from matters of teacher performance and into the consensual domain of authority. Within a complex system, appropriate action can only be conditioned by external authorities, not imposed. The system itself "decides" what is and is not acceptable. Pragmatically speaking, with regard to the emergence of shared mathematical insight, this means that the teacher cannot position herself or himself (or a textbook or a curriculum document) as the final authority on matters of appropriateness or correctness. Structures can and should be in place to allow students to participate in these deci- sions. For us, then, a key element in effective teaching is not maintaining control over ideas and correctness, but the capacity to disperse control. This is not a new issue among mathematics educators. Several researchers and theorists have commented on the matter, particularly those who work from crit- ical or liberatory stances (e.g., Powell &amp; Frankenstein, 1997; Skovsmose, 1994; Walkerdine, 1988). Rejecting such dichotomies as child versus society, teacher versus learner, and knowledge versus knower, these theorists have attempted to offer alternative interpretations of power and authority. For example, instead of seeing these phenomena as external and monological impositions, power and authority might be redescribed in terms of discourses (Walkerdine, 1988); formatting (Skovsmose, 1994); or shared action, consensual domains, cospecifications, and emergent choreographies (Davis, Sumara, &amp; Kieren, 1996). Such shifts in vocab- ulary are intended to problematize the terms of popular debate over the relative merits of teacher- and child-centered instruction. Although presented as opposites, these emphases rely on similar assumptions about the organization of social systems. To elaborate a point already mentioned, the individual tends to be seen as the locus of learning and the fundamental particle of social action. Once the learner is cast in these terms, it follows that the classroom must be structured either around the fiction of the "normal child" (see Walkerdine, 1988) or around the fiction of the isolated human subject. In the extreme enactment of the first case, one must deliberately ignore diversity as one treats the class as a teacher-led homogenized mass. In the extreme version of the second case, one must fragment the classroom community into an accidental collection of fully independent agents whose needs must be addressed in a student-centered manner. We doubt that anyone regards mathematics teaching in terms of either extreme. By the same token, it often seems that many teachers regard their activity as being caught between these two poles. That this dichotomization does not span the full range of educative possibility, however, is evident in the example of the emergence of the teachers' mathematical collective. Notions of teacher-centeredness or student-centeredness are not very useful for making sense of these collectives- in large part because the phenomenon at the center of each collective is not a teacher or a student, but the collective phenomenon of a shared insight, similar to what Bowers and Nickerson (2001) call a collective conceptual orientation.</page><page sequence="18">154 Understanding Learning Systems Shared is a key notion here, and we use it as a synonym for distributed-a move that we recognize to be at odds with current usage in the mathematics education literature (and especially with the notion of "taken-as-shared," see for example Cobb &amp; Bauersfeld, 1995), but that we feel is consistent with popular usage. To elaborate, just as responsibilities, meals, opportunities, traits, and other objects or identifications might be shared or distributed, so might mathematical insights. But the suggestion that ideas can be shared only makes sense if the observer allows knowing and knowledge to be spread across agents' actions in collective contexts. Once again, if one turns from a focus on mathematical knowledge to the cultural norms and ongoing projects of social positioning, the fact that a classroom commu- nity is already a complex self-organizing adaptive unity can be more readily appre- ciated. These sorts of social activities are, for the most part, allowed to unfold on their own in the classroom, subject only to occasional interventions by teachers and others who might seek to affect qualities of interactions among students. That is, such projects are shared or distributed among the participants. This is not often the case for the mathematics, however. Far from being seen as a matter of decentral- ized control, mathematics is more often regarded as the embodiment of regi- mented, top-down, knower-independent knowledge. Nevertheless, as demonstrated within the teachers' collective, it is evident that control or authority might be redistributed-without getting caught in the trap of relativism. That is, the distribution or sharing of the authority across the classroom community need not be a matter of "anything goes." On the contrary, with the emer- gence of any complex collective, standards of acceptable response and acceptable activity---of rightness and wrongness-inevitably arise. Organized Randomness At first hearing, organized randomness may sound like an oxymoron. It is, however, a notion that is critical to the potential of complex emergence. It is a struc- tural condition that helps to determine the balance between redundancy and diver- sity among agents. Complex systems are rule-bound, but those rules determine only the boundaries of activity, not the limits of possibility. The teachers' collective, for example, was organized by some rather severe constraints, including those that arose from course requirements, time restraints, available technologies, and established mathematics. Yet, as limiting as these conditions were, they seem to have defined a territory rich in possibility. In effect, the idea of organized randomness is a reiteration of the proscription versus the prescription notion. To elaborate, the prescription-proscription distinc- tion might be seen to map onto the extremes of current popular debate. At one end of the spectrum, the caricature of a strictly rote-based, examination-driven, teacher- centered, traditional classroom seems the epitome of a prescriptive situation because the focus seems to be on specification of what is expected, and by conse- quence prohibiting everything else. On the other end, an exploration-based, expe-</page><page sequence="19">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 155 rience-oriented, student-centered, classroom appears to be proscriptive because there seems to be a commitment to open exploration. Such a mapping, however, is inappropriate. A difficulty arises in the extreme interpretation of the more exploratory classroom in terms of an "anything goes" abandonment of rigid structures and imposed expectations. A proscriptive situa- tion does not represent an abandonment of constraints, but a shift in thinking about the sorts of constraint that are necessary for generative activity. As Johnson (2001) explains, complex emergence occurs in rule-governed systems: their capacity for learning and growth and experimentation derives from their adherence to low level rules.... Emergent behaviors, like games, are all about living within boundaries defined by the rules, but also using that space to create something greater than the sum of its parts. (p. 181) With regard to activities for the mathematics classroom, Davis, Sumara, and Luce- Kapler (2000) have used the term liberating constraints to draw a distinction between tasks that are proscriptive and those that are prescriptive. Examples of tasks that fall into the latter category range from those that are too narrow to invite much variety of interpretation (e.g., "Turn to the Multiplication of Fractions page and do the questions in the first column.") and those that are too open to foster focused inter- pretations (e.g., "Write about the multiplication of fractions."). One is too organized and redundancy-oriented, the other is too unfocused and diversity-oriented. The structures that define complex systems, in contrast, maintain a delicate balance between sufficient organization to orient agents' actions and sufficient randomness to allow for flexible and varied response. Such situations are matters of neither "everyone does the same thing" nor "everyone does their own thing" but of everyone participating in ajoint project. In our experience, minor modifications are sometimes all that is needed to transform tasks that are either too narrow or too open into liberating constraints. By way of example, prompts such as "Write down five things that you know about the multiplication of fractions" (versus the sorts of prompts mentioned in the previous paragraph) have sponsored rich discussions in our middle school mathematics classes. In our experience, it is not often that we manage to identify appropriate liber- ating constraints when planning for teaching-that is, outside the classroom, it is impossible to decide whether or not an activity will be a liberating constraint. Most often, these parameters of activity must be refined and negotiated while teaching. Conditions sometimes must be relaxed, other times made more rigid, and still other times abandoned in favor of emergent student interests. An elaborated example of such negotiations is presented by Kieren, Davis, and Mason (1996). Neighbor Interactions Agents within a complex system must be able to affect one another's activities. On the surface, it might seem almost unnecessary to make this point. What is not so obvious, however, is what might constitute a neighbor in the context of a math- ematical community.</page><page sequence="20">156 Understanding Learning Systems In our ongoing efforts to interpret and to prompt complex activity around math- ematics, it was only recently that we realized that the "neighbors" in mathemat- ical communities are not physical bodies or social groupings. That is, personal and group interactions may not be as vital or useful as is commonly assumed. Rather, in mathematics, these neighbors that must "bump" against one another are ideas, hunches, queries, and other manners of representation.7 This is nicely illustrated in the classroom transcripts that Cobb (1999, pp. 14-15) uses to show how a math- ematical practice is developed. It is the students' ideas, metaphors, and words that are made to interact with one another. Rotman (2000) makes the point this way in his description of mathematics: Mathematics is an activity, a practice. If one observes its participants, then it would be perverse not to infer that for large stretches of time they are engaged in a process of communicating with themselves and one another; an inference prompted by the constant presence of standardly presented formal written texts (notes, textbooks, black- board lectures, articles, digests, reviews, and the like) being read, written, and exchanged, and of all informal signifying activities that occur when they talk, gestic- ulate, expound, make guesses, disagree, draw pictures, and so on. (pp. 7-8) This point was especially obvious within the teachers' collective, where mathe- matical insights arose in the juxtaposition of electronically transmitted represen- tations. What was important was not the opportunity for direct interaction (which was actually very limited), but the possibility of making ideas collide with one another. Within the context of the mathematics classroom, an implication here is that group work, pod seating, and class projects may be no more effective at occasioning complex interactivity than traditional straight rows-if the focus is not on the display and interpretation of diverse, emergent ideas. Concepts and understandings must be made to stumble across one another. Without these neighboring interac- tions, the mathematics classroom cannot become a mathematics community. In effect, this point is similar to the assertion that the knitting of logical propo- sitions is not the principal means by which mathematical knowledge is generated. Rather, as Varela (1999) suggests, "the proper units of knowledge are primarily concrete, embodied, incorporated, lived" (p. 7, emphasis in original)--and, hence, these embodied units of knowledge must somehow be made to interact with one another within those spaces dedicated to collective knowledge. Lakoff and Nuifiez 7 We do not mean to invoke a knowledge as object metaphor in the suggestion that ideas must be made to bump against one another. There is, however, a physical aspect to the point. For ideas to bump against one another, they must be represented in some way-for example, as oral expressions or written state- ments. The juxtaposition of various representations might then trigger other interpretations, which when represented might trigger still other interpretations or elaborations. To reemphasize, the representations are not the knowledge (although, of course, they are tied up in knowledge). Rather, we regard knowl- edge as the potential for action, and so the principle that we are attempting to develop here is more about the importance of actuating these potentials in the hope that they might trigger other, more sophisti- cated possibilities. Unfortunately, as is likely evident by the preceding sentence, an appropriate English vocabulary for this manner of interpretation has not yet emerged-hence, our reliance on the inaccu- rate, but useful, notions of bumping, colliding, and juxtaposition of ideas.</page><page sequence="21">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 157 (2000) further develop this point through investigations of how mathematical possibilities have been enabled through the blending of body-based images and metaphors. A caveat here is that not only must there be neighbor interactions, there must be a sufficient density of such interactions. It would seem that conceptual possibili- ties are rarely crowded enough in mathematics classrooms to give rise to rich inter- pretive moments-a matter to which we now turn. USING PRINCIPLES OF COMPLEXITY TO ORGANIZE A MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM Our interest in complexity science extends beyond its utility for describing events such as individual and collective learning, and in this section we attempt to make sense of what complexity science might have to offer by way of "advice to teachers." This discussion is rooted in the conviction that complexity science has some direct applications to classroom situations-although we qualify this claim by saying that its implicit proscriptive sensibility is not always well fitted to the predominantly prescriptive project of schooling. We proceed here with a description of a classroom event that occurred several months into a yearlong teaching experiment undertaken by Simmt in a seventh- grade classroom. To fully appreciate her intentions and actions in this event, it is helpful to know that her efforts were not principally focused on the development of individual understandings or technical competencies, but on the emergence of conceptual and interpretive possibilities that might not have been previously considered by any member of the group, including the teacher. The development of individual insight was still seen as important, but as dependent on-and, hence, secondary to--establishing the conditions necessary to an adaptive, self-orga- nizing mathematical community. We qualify this account by emphasizing at the outset that it is not offered as an event to be replicated or to be held up as a model. It is offered as illustration, not exemplar. It also bears mention that not all of the mathematics classes in this project are as generative as the one in this account. On the contrary, the classes seem to oscillate between ones that revolve around provocative mathematical engage- ments and ones in which the students and teacher "do school." The intention, then, is not to suggest some sort of reliable route to complex collective mathematical engagements. Rather, we present and interpret an instance in which deliberate and conscious efforts to structure a learning activity around the principles presented above seemed to occasion some provocative possibilities in a mathematics class- room. This episode unfolded near the end of November in the school year, 2 weeks into a study of integers. The initial focus of the unit was to foreground the sorts of appli- cations and images that students brought to the topic-including number lines, ther- mometers, profit and loss calculations, and altitude, as well as more primitive (and more implicit) set/container schemas (i.e., use of metaphors of collecting and</page><page sequence="22">158 Understanding Learning Systems ordering objects to understand processes of counting and other binary operations; see Lakoff &amp; Niifiez, 2000). An effort was made to elaborate and link these sorts of images through the introduction of two-sided chips, and these chips were made available to the students throughout the unit. In the session under discussion, students were asked to consider the statement, "3 x -4 =?" They were paired off by the teacher and each pair was given 10 minutes to agree on a product and to "Show how you know"-that is, to prepare an expla- nation on chart paper for presentation to their classmates. In our analysis, students' responses fell into five different categories (see Sfard, 2001, for a complementary analysis of similar sorts of prompts): * grouping of objects, whereby 3 x -4 = -12 was described and explained as three groups of four negative chips; * number line movement, where 3 x -4 was interpreted as three hops of length four, starting from zero, moving in a negative direction (which was not always presented as leftward or downward); * repeated addition, where 3 x -4 was rewritten as -4 + -4 + -4, and the already established rules of integer addition invoked; * appeal to external authority, of either a previously learned rule or the answer generated with a calculator; * extending a rule, in which one pair determined the magnitude of the product by ignoring the signs (i.e., 3 x 4 = 12), and assigned the product a negative value "because the minus was on the bigger number." A feature of these presentations, which took up the rest of the 45-minute block of class time, was that the students closely attended to one another's responses and explanations, without prompting or nagging from the teacher. Their engagements with one another's work were notable around two explanations in particular: the case of extending a rule and one version of repeated addition. Unfortunately, the case of extending the rule came too late in the session, and there was no opportu- nity that day to pursue the challenge, raised by the teacher, that whereas this strategy gave the same response as the others to 3 x -4, it would not for 4 x -3. In the other noted case, one pair had written on their poster that "0 + -4 + -4 + -4 = -12." The zero had clearly been squeezed into the left margin of the page, appar- ently added after the rest of the statement had been written. Because this statement differed from the other cases of repeated addition, the teacher asked about the zero. Pointing to a classmate, the student responded, "He said we have to start some- where." The "he" was a student who used a number line in his explanation. In our interpretation, the concept of multiplication as repeated addition was blended with the concept of multiplication as movement along a number line. The pair's response about their inclusion of a zero in the sum prompted some rumbling in the room, through which another student, Tim (a pseudonym), announced that "Actually it doesn't matter where you start from. It will be the same." As neither the original explanation nor Tim's elaboration had yet been</page><page sequence="23">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 159 explicitly linked to the number line image, the teacher asked Tim to say more. In response, he offered, "Well, negative four, three times, is always negative twelve, even if you start somewhere else on the number line." We focus our interpretations here on just a few elements in this already extremely partial account-namely, on the case of the "extending a rule," on Tim's insight, and on what these might have to say about the occasion of this classroom collective. Internal Diversity It must be reemphasized that this episode unfolded nearly 3 months into the school year and was preceded by many similar activities. Therefore, there was ample opportunity for appropriate norms of classroom engagement to have been estab- lished. Prominent among these was the importance of diverse contribution. With regard to the task that framed this session, for instance, 3 x -4 = ? it was not viewed by most as a challenge to close in on a rule or a definitive explanation, but as a place to articulate and compare different ideas. In fact, even the pairs that seemed to frame their activities in terms of rule-generation rather than reasoning, were very much a part of this "diverse possibility" game. A member of the pair that extended a rule was pleased with the fact that their response differed from all of the others. We interpret her expression of pleasure as an indication that members of this group did appreciate that divergent thought was an important aspect of math- ematical engagements in this setting, although the students seemed less aware that their response was lacking in terms of the sorts of rational explanations that were expected. The importance of diverse possibility was perhaps most evident in Tim's contribution, around the fact that 3 x -4 is "always -12, even if you start somewhere else on the number line." In formal terms, we interpret Tim's thinking to be consis- tent with a vector-based interpretation of multiplication, where direction and magnitude matter but location does not. We would highlight two points here. First, we regard Tim's insight as a mathe- matically significant one, but not because it had any great impact on the individ- uals' understandings. (In fact, it did not.) Its importance lies in the fact that, for the second time in the class, it was an instance of conceptual blending-or, perhaps more appropriately, a reblending. (The first blend was formally represented when the one group inserted a zero at the start of the addition statement.) That is, although it was not made explicit, Tim "invented" a vector-like interpretation of multiplication that was added to the already known interpretations of set grouping, repeated addition, and number line hopping. As Lakoff and Ntifiez (2000) demon- strate, these sorts of metaphoric elaborations have often been linked to moments of significant advances in the history of mathematics. Second, we would highlight that Tim's thought was clearly hinged to ideas that had already been represented. His comment that "negative four, three times, is always negative twelve, even if you start somewhere else on the number line" accommodates the grouping of objects, the number line movement, and the repeated addition schemas. The comment also points to a new layer of meaning,</page><page sequence="24">160 Understanding Learning Systems one that frees the construct of multiplication from the assumption of a starting place of zero. This more abstract, potentially more powerful possibility arose in the juxta- position of diverse interpretations-the bumping together of ideas. As such, the insight was a property of the collective, not of any specific agent of the collective. It was a case of distributed intelligence. This new bit of knowledge-this emer- gence potential to action-was rooted in the diversity represented among the students. Redundancy The redundancies that underlie a system's robustness can be difficult to inter- pret because they tend to serve as the ground of activity, not the figure. Aspects such as shared vocabularies, compatible experiences, and assumed social roles are not often the subjects of conscious attention. They are, rather, the transparent backdrop that gives shape to and enables activity in the mathematics classroom. Arguably, then, this part of our analysis should be the lengthiest-and it would be if we were to attempt a more full-bodied description of the setting. In the months preceding the reported event, Simmt had worked hard to establish expec- tations for classroom interactions, standards of acceptable explanation, and appre- ciations of divergent thought. As well, she had placed heavy pedagogical emphases on the sorts of experiences, images, tools, and metaphors that infuse interpretations of various concepts. The intention of these efforts was to establish a necessary redundancy among participants-that is, to ensure that common understandings among agents were adequate to enable the emergence of collective understandings. Part of this redun- dancy is related to the sociomathematical norms of the setting (Cobb, 1999), but not all. Other forms of redundancy included common artifacts, vocabulary, proce- dures, and mastery of facts deemed basic. Such groundwork, although not the central theme of this analysis, is arguably the main work of the mathematics teacher, as Cobb (1999) and Lampert (1990) have developed in more detail. Decentralized Control Was this lesson teacher-centered or learner-centered? As might be gleaned from the discussion thus far, we regard this particular dichotomy as a distraction. It reduces the complexity of the classroom as it prompts attentions toward particular individuals rather than onto what we interpret to be shared and emergence under- standings. The knowledge in this setting, as demonstrated in the range of interpretations, did not reside in any person in particular. Nor was the authority exclusively lodged in one character, one argument, or one resource. The control of the knowledge, that is, was decentralized, and that decentralization was necessary for some of the ideas to arise. This was especially evident as the teacher-researcher observed this event. She had anticipated that the class would progress in a certain way. However, the</page><page sequence="25">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 161 "3 x -4 = ?" prompt triggered possibilities that she could never have consciously or deliberately brought to her planning and teaching. In this setting, integer multi- plication was an event of complex knowing that was authored in the interactions of people, ideas, materials, displays, and other relational aspects-as opposed to being authorized by the teacher or a textbook. This is not to say, however, that the teacher did not exercise a particular authority. Her role was more than facilitator. In particular, the collective rules of engagement were very much embodied in the manner in which she set the task and in the accu- mulated history of her responses within this collective. And while such instruction could certainly be analyzed in terms of power and authority, an interpretation based on such monological metaphors would have to ignore the complex, co-specifying activities during the session. It would also have to focus on the activities of indi- viduals, rather than on the shared knowledge of the collective. This distinction is similar to one developed by Bauersfeld (1992), as he contrasts the discovery approach to an integrated (culture) approach. The former tends to be structured around prepared materials, preplanned steps, and prestated learning outcomes. In the latter, "students are expected to search for patterns, to assume regu- larities, and to relate developing or contrasting ideas, as well as to give reasons and arguments for the issue under discussion" (1992, p. 23). So framed, the emergent interpretations and the ultimate learning outcomes cannot be prespecified-or, in our terms, control is distributed. Organized Randomness Much in contrast to the manner in which the topic of multiplication of integers is most frequently presented, this lesson involved just one item. On the surface, the decision to structure an entire class around the matter of 3 x -4 might seem a rather severe constraint. But, of course, the focus of the session was not really the rules of integer multiplication, but the concept. The lesson was part of an ongoing investigation into the sorts of images and metaphors that enframe discussions and applications of integers and binary operations-and how those conceptual tools might be worked to give insight into the topic at hand. (At least, this is how the teacher understood her activity. It is not at all clear that any of the students regarded their engagements in such terms-a point that underscores our assertion that the authority or control in this classroom was distributed. Had the teacher insisted that learners interpret their understandings in such terms, the session might have been more about uncovering correct answers and less about generating diverse possi- bilities.) The imposed constraint of a single item for interpretation, coupled to require- ments to provide reasoned statements and to display their explanations, helped to organize the randomness. More descriptively, structures of organization were operating on both tacit and explicit levels. As already suggested, on the tacit level, norms of appropriate activity had already been established, and these served to frame student activities and interactivities. Implicit rules of the activity, for</page><page sequence="26">162 Understanding Learning Systems example, included the necessity of a convincing explanation and the requirement of attending to others. On the more explicit level, specific to this session was the strategy of constructing posters, to present thoughts, and using the posters to orga- nize ideas. A key point is that, with regard to the notion of organized randomness, the chal- lenge is not to prompt randomness. It will always and already be present by virtue of the complex nature of human cognition. The challenge for the teacher is to find means of utilizing the randomness that is rooted in individual interpretation within the collective space of the classroom. The posters idea was developed in specific response to this matter, and maintained the balance between sufficient organiza- tion to orient students' actions and sufficient randomness to allow for flexible and varied response. Phrased differently, the structure of the activity served to mediate individual insights and the collective project of learning mathematics. For us, the deliberate attention given to the mediation of individual and collec- tive projects represents a rejection of that approach to mathematics teaching that is structured around the sequenced presentation of isolated concepts. For instance, introductions to integers are often handled as organized movements through preparsed subconcepts in which, for example, multiplication is assigned particular interpretations according to the topics that preceded it. By contrast, in the lesson presented, the topic of integer multiplication was simultaneously a discussion of other operations, personal experiences, and possible applications. Although we believe it important for teachers to have well developed understandings of how mathematical concepts fit together, complexity science prompts us to assert that such analytic understandings must be part of broader appreciations of concepts' experiential requisites, metaphoric roots, and so on. Along with Ball and Bass (in press), we suspect that mathematics teachers need to be aware of the sorts of ideas and images that have been knitted together into the concepts and the abstractions that they are required to teach (see also Sfard, 2001). Neighbor Interactions A driving assumption in this article has been that the collective dynamics involved in the production of knowledge emerge not simply amid the juxtaposition of bodies, but amid the juxtaposition of interpretive possibilities-hence the paired interac- tions, the poster presentations, and the surrounding discussions. Such was the condition that enabled the emergence of an idea not previously considered by anyone in the room, at least not in the terms presented: Tim's merging of the loca- tion-specific suggestion that "we have to start somewhere" (as one multiplies by hopping along a number line) with the location-independent idea of multiplication as repeated addition. The consequent blending gave rise to the vector-like notion that multiplication is a directed movement of specified magnitude. This idea may never be taken much further in these students' Grade 7 mathe- matics course. Use or elaboration of the idea is not the point here, though. The crit- ical issue is that the possibility of conceptual blends--that is, of melding ideas and</page><page sequence="27">Brent Davis and Elaine Simmt 163 images with others-was present and explicit. This is important not just because it presents the possibility of surprising combinations, but because it foregrounds the place of interpretation. (Interpretation here is understood in terms of the delib- erate reading of two or more ideas against one another. So framed, an interpreta- tion is a sort of emergent form.) Pedagogically speaking, for us the idea of neighbor interactions prompts careful consideration of strategies for representation of concepts and understandings. Our preliminary comparisons of the effects of verbalized and written representations, based on analyses of videotaped interactions and varied classroom products, suggest that physical artifacts are a vital element in this regard. Not only do arti- facts facilitate the juxtaposition of ideas, they help to preserve possibilities whose relevance may not be immediately apparent. In both examples of the teachers' collective and the integers lesson, written representations made it possible to revisit, to compare, and to elaborate previous insights. Further to this point, phys- ical artifacts can serve as a record of emergent ideas, means to offload some of the demands on individual consciousness and memory (see Norretranders, 1998). In the context of the reported episode, a benefit of the sorts of artifact-mediated neighbor interactions that were present in this lesson is that, among such interac- tions, instances of "playing the wrong game" became very apparent. In this session, it was clear (to the teacher at least) that three pairs-the ones who saw the task in terms of generation of rules rather than in terms of interpretation of concepts-had misunderstood what was required in this setting for an argument to be accepted as mathematical. We suspect that such misunderstandings are commonplace in math- ematics classrooms, but opportunities to problematize this rule-oriented sensibility are considerably less common. COMPLEXITY SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS TEACHING Twenty years ago, when we were both beginning our mathematics teaching careers, it was not uncommon to hear colleagues draw a distinction between teaching mathematics and teaching children-as though, somehow, an emphasis on one entailed a certain ignorance of the other. Neither of us had an adequate response at the time. We believe that we do now, however. The manner in which complexity science casts both children and mathematics-along with classroom communities, conversational interactions, and similar phenomena-as adaptive and self-organizing learning forms prompts us to think in terms of unities nested within unities, rather than in terms of discrete entities. So framed, the imagined tension between learners' bodies and bodies of knowledge, along with the need to build bridges between the two, vanishes. To teach children well, we argue, we must conceive of our activity in terms of an active participation in the body of mathe- matics knowledge by creating the conditions for the emergence of bottom-up, locally controlled, collective learning systems. Phrased in somewhat different terms, for us, the main attraction of complexity science is that it provides means of reading across the concerns and contributions</page><page sequence="28">164 Understanding Learning Systems of radical, social, and critical constructivist discourses. At the same time it speaks to the multileveled, deliberate, and practical concerns of formal education (Davis &amp; Sumara, in press). In particular, it prompts us to suggest that, in terms of the range of complex forms, the teacher's main attentions should perhaps be focused on the establishment of a classroom collective-that is, on ensuring that conditions are met for the possibility of a mathematical community. Such an emphasis is not meant to displace concern for individual understanding. The suggestion, rather, is that the individual learner's mathematical understandings might be better supported-not compromised-if the teacher pays more attention to the grander learning system (Bauersfeld, 1992; Bowers &amp; Nickerson, 2001; Burton, 1999; Cobb, 1999; Crawford, 1999). To that end, the five conditions discussed in this article are not merely useful tools for after-the-fact analyses of classroom events. They can also be put to instrumental use to guide the structuring of teachers' engagements with learners. For instance, the notion of internal diversity points to the need to develop in-class activities that can be adapted by learners to their particular understandings and interpretations. Redundancy highlights the importance of shared experiences and established stan- dards of engagement. Decentralized control, among other things, points to a recon- sideration of lesson planning, less in terms of prescriptions and itineraries and more as thought experiments. Organized randomness is in some ways an elaboration of this point. It foregrounds the importance of setting boundaries and rules- constraints that operate proscriptively rather than prescriptively. Finally, neighbor interactions prompt attention to the manners in which ideas might be represented and juxtaposed. Again, that such conditions are met in a mathematics classroom is no assurance that complex possibilities will arise. However, a neglect of such conditions will provide a reasonable assurance that collective activity will never exceed the collection of individual insights. At the moment, we are engaged in different efforts to assess the utility of these ideas in the teaching of mathematics-projects that involve considerable collab- orative work with preservice and practicing teachers in various settings. Across these projects, a consistent and somewhat resilient theme has arisen. As conditions for complex emergence are described, illustrations provided, and engagements prompted, inevitably discussions turn to the phenomenon of the teachable moment-a cohering of many bodies in an instance of shared purpose and insight. It may be that what we are talking about in this article is just that sort of event. However, we offer that the phenomenon of the teachable moment can be the rule of mathematics classrooms, not the exception. The key is a willingness to under- stand the classroom community as an adaptive, self-organizing--complex-unity. REFERENCES American Psychological Association. (2001).
