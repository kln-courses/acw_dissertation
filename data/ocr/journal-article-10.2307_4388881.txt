Pp. 310. $4.2-. Professor Nilsson's book, A History of Greek Re- ligion, is a most valuable contribution to the history of Greek religious thought. It consists of a lecture de- livered before the University College of Wales at</page><page sequence="2">DECEMBER 13, 1926] THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY 71 Aberystwyth, and seven lectures delivered before the University of Uppsala. Each lecture, enlarged and revised, constitutes a chapter of the book. Endorsa- tion of the volume by so eminent an authority in comparative religion as Sir James G. Frazer, who has written the Preface (2-6), is trustworthy assurance of its high quality. Moreover, what manner of scholar and writer Professor Nilsson is was clearly revealed long ago in his book, Griechische Feste von Religioser Bedeutung mit Ausschluss der Attischen (Leipzig, Teubner, I906). The titles of the chapters indicate Professor Nilsson's originality of treatment, and cannot fail to rouse in the reader an expectation of studying a presentation and discussion that will be at once novel and stimulat- ing. The reader, I may add, will not be disappointed, unless he expects the author to solve problems which probably never will be completely solved. The contjents are as follows: I. Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and its Survival in Greek Religion (9-37); II. Origins of Greek My- thology (38-75); III. Primitive Belief and Ritual (76-- 104); IV. Gods of Nature and of Human Life (io5- 133); V. The Homeric Anthropomorphism and Ra- tionalism (134-I79); VI. Legalism and Mysticism (I80-223); VII. The Civic Religion (224-262); VIII. The Religion of the Cultured Classes and the Religion of the Peasants (263-304); Index (305-310). Professor Nilsson's successful handling of his subject challenges a reviewer to discuss the chapters individual- ly, but second thought brings the conviction that such a discussion would compel him, in order to be just, virtually to rewrite the book, or, perhaps, to write another book containing a large measure of commen- dation combined with a smaller measure of rebuttal. It is wise, therefore, to confine the review to a few comments of a more general nature and to several citations for the purpose of illustration. One cannot help observing with a great deal of admi- ration that, in a field where it is easy to allow the imagi- nation to run riot in a frenzy of conjecture, the author exhibits a most laudable caution and imposes upon himself an effective restraint. In t he first chapter this quality is especially noticeable. Of late years many hasty and unwarranted deductions have been made from the material remains of th,e Minoan-NMycenean period. Professor Nilsson, however, plunges to no conclusions without first ascertaining the depth of the water; a few times, to be sure, he seems to plunge, but only with knowledge of the soundings. For example, he is slow to draw inferences from our still indefinite knowledge of the race and the language of the Hittites (ii); he refuses to run the risk of doing violence to the evidence by attempting to reduce the explanations of the figures of the Minoan female divinity to a single formula. Moreover, his caution leads him to scrutinize certain generally accepted opinions concerning the Mi- noan Age. To be specific, he cannot regard the double- axe as the thunderbolt, but on the contrary explains it as the sacrificial axe with which the sacred ox was killed (15-I6). He declines to believe that there is evidence to show that there was any religious signifi- cance in the bull-fights depicted in so many Minoan remains (2 I). He rejects the lion-daemons by affirming his belief that the figures commonly thus named represent human beings ritually disguised as animals (20). He breaks with the traditional view of the development of the Greek pantheon (i i6-i i8), holding that "it is the needs of man that create the gods" (i i 6). The book contains many other such instances of independence and sanity of judgment, and nowhere are there more or better instances than in the passages in which the author deals with the origins of Greek mythology. As man's nature is manifold, so he ac- counts for the vast number and varieties of Greek myths in a multiplicity of ways. Though generally cautious, Professor Nilsson is not entirely free from dogmatism that sometimes may be justly called 'cocksureness'. When he states that the name of Hermes is "one of the few that are etymologi- cally transparent" (I09), he fails to use the qualification 'seems', and may thereby be as guilty of following an easy 'Volksetymologie'. as were many of the Greeks themselves in an age when making etymologies was a popular fashion. If Professor Frothingham's con- tention (American Journal of Archaeology 20 [I9I6], I75-211) is correct that the Mesopotamian Ningish- zida and Hermes were originally identical, then the name of Hermes, which Professor Nilsson regards as of transparent meaning, probably signifies 'he of the right hand scepter (or pillar)', rather than 'he of the stone-heap'. Again, it is at least debatable whether (276) "In the Hermes and Cnidian Aphrodite of Prax- iteles there is not a spark of anything religiouis except the beauty. . . " Professor Nilsson is a philosopher, or, at any rate, argues like one, which is probably the same thing. Many a student of Greek life has found it difficult to understand the Greek conc2ption of fv4pLs, but no one who reads Professor Nilsson's argument upon this sub- ject in Chapter V (152-I53, 158-159) and Chapter VII (227-231) will any longer have an excuse for failing to appreciate this peculiarly Greek point of view of the gods and of human life and conduct. AWith similar skill he presents the problem of the relations of the gods and Fate (I67-I72), and thereby gives real assistance to the reader of Homer and the great tragic writers. His discussion of the significance of the practices of burial and cremation (99- I02) is a model of logical inference. The indefiniteness and paucity of the evidence in many phases of Greek religion are such as to invite prolixity. The author of this book, however, apparent- ly fearful of yielding to this tendency, has so shrunk away from it that he has gone to the opposite extreme of compressing his material into small compass. Some- times his meaning is obscure, so folded up are the successive steps of his argument. The reader ought not to be left to draw his own inferences as he is, for in- stance, on page go in these sentences: ... Zeus' fleece, the much-discussed A61 K '&amp;LOP, belongs to 'the boisterous Zeus' (Matd6KTIOS). I am inclined to think that in these rites lies the key to the explanation of the myth of the Golden Fleece; it is associated with the Zeus of Mount Laphystion.
