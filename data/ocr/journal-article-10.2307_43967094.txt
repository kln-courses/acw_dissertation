This contains substantive 16 papers edited by 36 volume lead- contains 16 papers by 36 lead- ing scholars of the Neolithic econo- mies of Southwest Asia and Europe. Originating from the project "Origins and Spread of Stock-keeping in the Near East and Europe" (OSSK) and funded by the UK Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), it is a major contribution to our understanding of the origins of agriculture, which has come to be recognized as one of the foremost transformations in human history. This project and volume is a compan- ion to an earlier project (Colledge and Conolly, The Origins and Spread of Domes- tic Crops in Southwest Asia and Europe, 2007). The focus of both endeavors was a comparative analysis of records of the exploitation of new plant and animal resources by Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic food producers and the conclusions that could be derived from them. Both projects included a prepublication workshop that brought individual scholars together and thereby enabled them to place their research within the broader context of the research conducted by their peers. Most of the papers presented at the workshops were published in their respective proceedings. The detailed subsistence data assem- bled by the authors in The Ońgins and Spread of Domestic Animals in Southwest Asia and Europe is testimony to the sig- nificance of their work. The database for this project involved the quantita- tive analysis of ca. 13,600 published records from ca. 650 sites (comprising 970 separate chronological/cultural phases) and dating between ca. 12,000 and ca. 5000 cal B.C. (p. 14). The study area extends from the Levant and Ana- tolia to southeast, central and northwest Europe and the sequence of papers fol- lows the earliest spread of farming from east to west and models the pattern of the companion volume on archaeobot- any (Colledge and Conolly, The Ońgins and Spread of Domestic Crops in Southwest Asia and Europe , 2007) . Among the geo- graphic regions represented are the Southern Levant (Martin and Edwards, Chapter 4), Anatolia (Peters et al., Chapter 5), Cyprus (Vigne, Chapter 6), Greece (Halstead and Isaakidou, Chapter 7), the Adriatic (Bonsall et al., Chapter 8), Italy, Istria, the Tyrrhenian Islands and southern France (Rowley- Conwy et al., Chapter 9, the Iberian peninsula (Saña, Chapter 10), the northern European plain (Marciniak, Chapter 11), the Balkans and central Europe (Manning et al., Chapter 12), Canadian Journal of Archaeology/Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 38:359-362 (2014)</page><page sequence="2">360 • MILNE Switzerland (Schibier, Chapter 13), northern France (Arbogast and Jeu- nesse, Chapter 14), northern Europe (Rowley-Conwy, Chapter 15), and Britain and Ireland (Schulting, Chap- ter 16). In addition, Girdland-Flink and Larson (Chapter 2) focus on the evidence for and processes involved in pig domestication, while Gerbault et al. (Chapter 3) study gene-culture coevolu- tion as it relates to lactase persistence and dairying. Stephen Shennan's foreword estab- lishes the six major objectives that guided the research and subsequent organization of the volume. These were: 1) to establish key characteristics of Early Neolithic animal exploitation economics through time and over broad geographic regions; 2) to under- stand the key factors that account for variation in Early Neolithic animal exploitation; 3) to explore possible variations in husbandry and hunting strategies that developed as Neolithic herding economies spread from their areas of origin; 4) to look for possible adaptive changes in husbandry and hunting practices; 5) to investigate the evidence for local indigenous domes- tication; and, 6) to establish whether the zooarchaeological evidence for the spread of farming is similar to, or dif- ferent from, that already established on the basis of archaeobotanical data (pp. 13-14). In Chapter 1, Dobney and colleagues review the myriad challenges of defining animal domestication and determining when animals can be considered to be domesticated. They note the wide varia- tion in morphological, physiological and behavioral characteristics of domestic species and the host of environmental, biological and cultural variables at play. They assert that, Since the domestication process is the result of unconscious and intentional human intervention in the reproduction of another spe- cies and of selection operating in environments largely structured by humans, it can be argued that the process intensifies with each generation as humans and animals interact... [p. 18]. Four basic concepts, biogeogra- phy, morphology, demography and biomolecules, were utilized by the vol- ume's authors in the interpretation of excavated zooarchaeological remains. Based on biogeographical information Dobney et al. report that there is an increase in dietary breadth in the Late Mesolithic which is often followed by a rapid narrowing of dietary breadth as animal husbandry is adopted (p. 19). They note that quantifiable changes in skeletal and dental morphology have long been used to suggest domestica- tion but the development of advanced geometric morphometries in the 1980s and 1990s enables researchers to separate size from shape and they assert that shape analysis is a superior predictor of domestication for some species (p. 20). Dobney et al. review the traditional approach of using herd demography to confirm domestica- tion and confirm that despite its many shortcomings, . . . demographic profiling provides a useful tool for investigating devel- oped herding strategies, especially when used alongside comparative analysis of NISP data and biometrie information [p. 21]. Lastly, they discuss the exciting new ave- nues provided by biomolecular research Canadian Journal of Archaeology 38 (2014)</page><page sequence="3">THE ORIGINS 8c SPREAD OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS IN SW ASIA &amp; EUROPE • 361 involving ancient DNA, stable isotopes and trace elements. Some of the most interesting papers in this publication are those that deal with the social contexts of animal domestication. Martin and Edwards (Chapter 4) report on regional varia- tion in the uptake/development of domestic caprines in the Southern Levant and speculate that it is tied to networks of interaction amongst various social groups and geographic regions. That these networks were responsible for trade in shells, minerals and stone- beads over the whole Levantine area is well established and Martin and Edwards propose that domestic caprines may sim- ilarly have been "objects" for exchange (p. 75). Peters et al. (Chapter 5) speculate that changes in ideology may have been a driving force behind subsistence trans- formations in Early Neolithic Anatolia. They point to cosmological concepts and beliefs suggested by symbolic rep- resentations on monuments at Göbekli Tepe where headless anthropomorphic figures appear to be exerting power over taxa as diverse as insects, spiders, scorpions, snakes, birds and mammals. They interpret the symbols as indica- tive of a "...hierarchically structured universe" and "... representing a funda- mental paradigm shift" (p. 110). And they propose that the new mindset may have been the driving force behind the transition from hunting to ungulate domestication and finally to herding. That Göbekli Tepe was "a ritual centre of supra-regional importance" and thus a magnet for hunter-gatherers from different parts of Anatolia is clear; it may also have served as the location where diverse peoples met, interacted and shared knowledge of ungulates (p. 110). Marciniak (Chapter 11) continues this theme by examining the changing social and ceremonial role of cattle in Early and Middle Neolithic communi- ties on the North European Plain of Poland. He looks at economic, social and ontological relations between people and animals in the earliest farm- ing communities, as well as the changes that occurred as farming became more securely entrenched. Of the Early Neo- lithic, Marciniak reports "a steady and uninterrupted development and a high degree of homogeneity in human-ani- mal relations..." (p. 232). He confirms the importance of cattle in feasting but notes that the evidence challenges the idea of a meat-based livestock rearing system of Early Neolithic cattle farming. He suggests that the social and ceremo- nial importance of cattle in the Middle Neolithic remained significant but was manifest in different ways and in dif- ferent settings (p. 232). Among these transformations were the emergence of the household as a new social entity and the separation of animals, particularly cattle, from the ceremonial and social domains characteristic of the earlier period. Marciniak speculates that this separation was a ". . . prerequisite for the dynamic expansion of the post-Early Neolithic communities . . . into previously uninhabited areas" (p. 232) . In addition to 16 chapters, The Origins and Spread of Domestic Animals in South- west Asia and Europe includes 110 figures (largely graphs and maps) , 39 tables and four indexes; the latter includes a general index, an index of site names, an index of species and an index of common spe- cies names. There is detailed informa- tion on the volume's editors and the academic affiliation of the authors and editors indicates that the majority are affiliated with European universities Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 38 (2014)</page><page sequence="4">362 • MILNE and research institutes. Notably, one of the editors, James Conolly, is a Canada Research Chair at Trent University. The amount of data summarized in figures and tables is substantive. This volume is a synthesis of our current knowledge of the origins and spread of stock-keeping in southwest Asia and Europe and is a superb example of scholarly writing des- tined for the book shelves of upper level undergraduate and graduate students and their professors rather than the gen- eral reading public. In closing, this reviewer would reiter- ate that a key finding in most papers was that variability reigned supreme - vari- ability between species of plants and animals, variability between cultural phases, and variability due to topogra- phy, accessibility, ecology, and exchange networks. Multiple lines of evidence clearly show that notions of a single centre from which domestic plants and animals emerged should be abandoned. With each new site additional questions emerge, so much so that archaeologists will continue to explore the mysteries of the domestication processes for years to come.
