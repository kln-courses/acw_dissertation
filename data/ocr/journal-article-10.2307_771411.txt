<plain_text><page sequence="1">GASTON LACHAISE BY WINSLOW AMES We regret deeply an error which occurred in the March issue of PARNASSUS whereby part of Mr. Ames' article was omitted in setting the continuation from page 7. The entire section is reprinted below. The marble Knees, in the collection of Edward M. M. Warburg, is the most fully simplified of all Lachaise's works, and is almost purely abstrac- tion. The whole object has become a symbol, almost in the sense of the symbol of the Bell trademark which appears in the bas-relief frieze in the Telephone and Telegraph Building. In another small marble, the Crouching Torso recently acquired by Smith College, the articulation and inter- penetration of the principal masses of the female torso are so presented as to make not only a marvellously lucid exposition of the organism but also the most polyfacial piece of small sculpture of my acquaintance. One first sees it from above, but he must also see it from slightly below and certainly from all around. In this sense it is totally different from the unifacial or, at most, bifacial torsos. Lachaise, in spite of his admiration for the primitive, was not primitivis- tic. He did not archaistically employ the primitive Egyptian and Greek device of twisting bodies in order to present the broadest possible aspect of each section. This broadest possible aspect he achieved, if we may read a literary process into his manner of creation, by selecting for each part of the body a silhouette at its statis- tical extreme, and then revolving that to produce a solid. His draw- ings, though they are seldom actually connected with individual sculptures, may have been another means of ar- riving at stylizations. There exist among them numerous sets of varia- tions on a theme, which usually con- clude with examples of extraordinary virtuosity in line; whole figures set down with half a dozen swinging switchbacks of the pencil. And this not in the stunty complicated man- ner of Spencerian-pen animals and birds, but with certain knowledge of construction and equally certain flair for pictorial composition in two dimensions. Some of Lachaise's low reliefs have the same character, notably the 1927 alabaster Woman and the 1934 plaster panel of a woman in diaphanous but inflexible draperies. His other reliefs, which are less like drawings, vary more in quality, though less in man- ner, than his work in the round. One is tempted to say that the destroyed panel for the Chicago Fair was the best of them. The R.C.A. building panels are hard to see, but they seem better than the two newer ones on the International building of Rocke- feller Center, one of which is certain- ly not very good (Lachaise did not cut these in stone himself). Of the total output of Lachaise we have not yet a full knowledge. He was, for a not conspicuously rewarded worker in a field which is the most expensive to practice in of all the arts, comparatively prolific; though not so prolific as the successful manufactur- ers of "garden" sculpture or those decorators who are kept as pets by classicizing architects. As has already been mentioned, the publicly visible oeuvre will be enlarged from time to time. The group recently shown in plaster at the Whitney Museum is the first major addition. Embodying concretely the sculptor's feeling for the dual nature of the human race, it is a double organism in whose com- plicated structure, despite implications of action and reaction, there is great repose. Lachaise's equilibrium is not the neutral equilibrium of the deriva- tive decorator who puts the progress of the arts forward not one inch, nor yet the unstable equilibrium of the charmer who sells not sculpture but adolescent flesh embarrassingly transsubstantiated. His is the stable equilibrium of the complete and in- evitable. Of the other major works already made known, La Montagne awaits the placement intended for her. The overpowering Man awaits casting in bronze, as does the Floating Woman. In these, in addition to their sumptuous majesty, there are a poise and a paradoxical lightness which, be- ing not too ethereal, do not give the lie to their perfectly obvious mas- siveness. The lightness is a sub- stantial lightness, like that of a hearty souffle. The poise derives from the whole nature of the work, not from an accidental pose, and is there- fore evidence of a convincing and ab- solutely possible balance. The great works now in plaster should be cast in bronze, but the fact that their au- thor cannot now labor on the bronzes after their return from the foundry makes an appreciable difference. Like- wise, no matter how advanced the preliminary designs for the Fairmount Park monument, it seems improper to execute it full size as Lachaise's. There remain the Standing Wom1an of 1912-1927 and the Standing Wo- man of 1930-1934. The former, which is in the collection of John A. Dunbar, I have seen on every occa- sion, I believe, of its public exhibition since 1928. The latter, which is at New London, I have seen daily for many months; and time, though it has increased admiration and fondness, has very little reduced puzzlement. Both figures have indeed in the highest degree the pride and unap- proachableness which make explana- tion so difficult. Both have a sort of entogeneric vitality, a sense of being full of blood and breath, a look of being pneumatic but certainly not deflatable. And both are of heroic mould, though the later is about half again as tall as the life-sized earlier one. Beyond this, there are differ- ences. From the extraordinarily long time spent upon it, the first has gained the look of being durch komponiert: there is no point of view from which the insistent flow of lines is not satis- factory. The figure loses, though, by being a little self-conscious. Its forms are not so exaggerated as those of the later work, but its state of mind and to some extent its pose are mannered. Yet its mysterious grandeur and its godlike bearing, to- gether with its polyfaciality, make it hard to surpass. The second figure is definitely bad from one point of view: the left side is clumsy when seen at right angles. This question of unifaciality versus polyfaciality, which Stanley Casson has discussed, cannot be settled on merits. Despite its fault from one point of view, the later work is cer- tainly a polyfacial composition. It is also a very compact one. Its articu- lation is much more emphasized than that of the early Woman, who has a certain blurriness which may be a subtle way of making transitions. The later Woman has hardly a transition about her, every ample feature being firmly marked. This is a dogmatic exposition of organic structure. It would be useless for anyone to argue, for instance, against the stylizations: the luxurious wasp waist, the heart- shaped abdomen, and the enviable calves. The whole thing seems in- arguable; one may analyze and analyze without discovering what is the dis- quieting ingredient in this richly sat- isfactory complex. Perhaps it posi- tively requires the presence of the companion figure, the colossal Man. The complementary nature of these figures, as of the group newly shown, FORTY-ONE</page><page sequence="2">is as far removed as possible from the distressful anthropomorphism of Ro- din's Kiss. Yet the fact that there is in the Standing Woman of 1930-1934 a disturbing quality which is absent from the Standing Woman of 1912- 1927, may be taken to justify La- chaise's own belief that the earlier sculpture was both the kernel and the summation of his work. For the present, let it be so. N E W DOCUMENTATION ON THE LARGE BUDDHA IN THE LONDON EXHI- BITION Editor's Note: We are happy to publish the following note from Dr. Siren concerning his article in the February issue of PARNASSUS: My report of the inscription on the pedestal of the large marble Buddha in the London Exhibition was not quite correct owing to the fact that it was taken from a document given to me in Peking in 1922, written by the Chinese Assistant of the owner of the sculpture, who evidently had not taken proper care in copying the in- scription correctly. Since then I have had occasion to see not only a rubbing of this inscription, but also the origi- nal sales-document drawn up in 1918, when the statue was sold to M. Culty. On the ground of these documents the following corrections can be of- fered: The inscription is at present not quite complete, because the upper right corner of the pedestal has been knocked off and the front has been rubbed, but its main contents are quite clear and interesting in so far as they give the date and the name of the place for which the statue was made. Although the three first characters are completely missing and a portion of the fourth, there can be little doubt that the beginning of the inscription should be read as follows: "In the Great Sui dynasty, K'ai Huang's reign, the fifth year, cyclically called i-ssu third month, eighteenth day, for the Ch'ing-kuang temple in Han-ts'ui vil- lage, through, the co6peration of eighty men, this image in white jade (stone) of Mi-to (Amitabha) was made together with two Bodhisattva statues." The interpolation of the four first characters as Great Sui, K'ai Huang, is justified by the fact that the only fifth year which was called i-ssu (approximately about this period) was the fifth year of K'ai Huang's reign; the statue could not for stylistic reasons be sixty years earlier or sixty years later than 585. According to the sales-document, the statue stood in the Hsiang-pei village in Wan-hsien of the district of Pao-ting Fu. It was sold in order to obtain means for the erection of a village-school. It was further agreed that it should be transported to the Fang-shun Chiao station south of Pao- ting Fu at the responsibility of the sellers, and from here it was trans- ported by train to Peking. It may be added, that when the statue arrived in the capital and was pulled from the station through the Chien-men, the convoy was stopped by the police, because it was said to be too heavy for the streets. M. Culty had to sign a promise to have all the damage to the streets repaired in case such should occur. Nevertheless the statue has since then traveled widely over two continents! Feb. 24, 1936.
