<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Concept of Progress in / Organic / Evolution / / BY GEORGE GAYLORD SIMPSON j)elief that progress is somehow inherent in organic evolution has long served as rationale and exemplar for ideas of progress in general. That belief is old; indeed, its basis was historically preevolutionary. Nevertheless it is still influential today. For example, a well known psychologist, Raymond Cattell, has re- cently proposed that evolutionary progress be used as a basis not only for ethics but also for planning both the biological and the social future of mankind.1 I will here outline the origins of this concept and its present status from the point of view of an evolutionary biologist. The Great Chain, Lamarck, and Cuvier The concept of progress in evolution can be, and has been, connected with that variously called "échelle des êtres*' "la série/' "ladder of life," "escalator of life," "scale of being," "great chain of being," "principle of plenitude," and other terms. Its history has been traced in detail by Lovejoy.2 Like many later notions, it may be found retrospectively and in only inchoate form in Aristotle. In relatively modern times it was finally stated with i Raymond B. Cattell, A New Morality from Science: Beyondism (New York: Pergamon Press, 1972). 2 Arthur O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1953).

During the eighteenth century it was so widely accepted by philosophers and other intellectuals as to become virtually a dogma. The significance is that all animals, at least, or all organisms, or at its broadest all natural entities, form a single series from low to high, simple to complex, in a continuum without divergences or gaps. In retrospect that idea seems almost inescapably evolutionary, and it has been so taken by some students.3 However, Lovejoy has clearly shown, and it is evident from eighteenth-century sources, that that is not the case. The seriation was based on living, contemporaneous species, and it had no time dimension. The thought that an actual physical-biological derivation of higher from lower forms might be represented was not then expressed. A frequent interpretation was that the échelle or chain represented the plan followed by God at the creation. (Thomas Jefferson, not especially noted for piety, adopted that view.) Others simply accepted the supposed seriation as an interesting descriptive fact about nature. The momentous step of considering the échelle to be not only spatial but also temporal was taken by Lamarck, especially in his Philosophie zoologique (1809). This was the heart of the Lamarckian theory, and the late nineteenth- and early twentieth- century Neo-Lamarckians were mistaken in thinking that Lamarck's main emphasis was on the inheritance of acquired characters. A characteristic Lamarckian statement may be taken from the introduction to Lamarck's later great work on inverte- brates (1815) because there he undertook to clarify the somewhat confused exposition of the Philosophie , which had, in his opinion, been misunderstood by some of his critics. Indeed if one runs through the series of known animals from one end to the other, arranged according to their natural affinities and beginning with the most imperfect ones, and if one goes up thus from class to class, from the infusoria which begin this series to the mammals which end it, one will find by consideration of 3 For example, Emile Guyénot, Les sciences de la vie aux XVIIe et XVIIIe siècles: l'idée d'évolution (Paris: Albin Michel, 1941).</page><page sequence="3">30 SOCIAL RESEARCH the stage of organization of the different animals incontestable proofs of a progressive complication of their various structures and a proportionate increase in the number and prominence of the faculties that they derive from those structures; finally, one will be convinced that the reality of the progression in question is now an observed fact and not an act of abstract reason.4 That is a fairly clear statement of the supposed échelle and could even be taken as nonevolutionary, being based on con- temporaneous animals. Nevertheless Lamarck here and there made clear that the contemporaneous sequence was supposed to have arisen successively through time, in an evolutionary manner. (The term "evolution" and its cognates were not used in this sense in Lamarck's day; Lamarck's term was "transformation," and even now some French writers make a distinction between transformation and evolution.) For example, he speaks in the same work of "the plan of operations followed by nature in successively giving existence to the different animals." 5 Lamarck's philosophical and theoretical views had little effect during his lifetime and have been almost completely not only discarded but also forgotten by modern biologists. This fact and the reasons for it have historical importance but cannot be discussed here.6 Notice of the Lamarckian theory is nevertheless necessary for the present topic because it introduced the concept of progress into an evolutionary context, where it has remained to varying extent ever since, and for another reason. In a way rather painfully typical of Lamarck, while introducing the novel evolutionary progressionist point of view he also indicated its weakness if not complete invalidity on the basis then available. Lamarck turned out to be a poor or at best an inadequate philosopher and theorist, but he was, for his day, an excellent 4J. B. P. A.

In spite of having gone astray, he was almost the peer of Darwin in basing his theories on profound and extensive objective knowledge of organisms. Although with one side of his brain, the philosophical side, he insisted on the échelle des êtres as the central factor in evolution and even as an observed fact, with the other side of his brain, the scientific side, he knew that the échelle did not really exist. In the intro- duction to the Animaux sans vertèbres he took critics to task for believing what he had said in the Philosophie zoologique and indeed now repeated in different passages of the later introduc- tion. His long, detailed study of recent invertebrates showed, as he pointed out, that instead of a single, gradual, continuous échelle, there are many gaps, discontinuities, and digressions. He even said, without being specific, that different parts of the sup- posed sequence had arisen de novo from their bases by separate spontaneous generation. Yet Lamarck insisted that overall, even if not in any defined detail, evolution had progressed up a single, wide ladder. Some later evolutionists, without necessarily being Lamarckian, have managed to make the same equivocal sort of adjustment. If Lamarck can thus be considered to have weakened the foun- dations of evolutionary progressionism from within even while he was laying them, his contemporary Cuvier was simultaneously attacking them from without. Cuvier would have nothing to do with the échelle des êtres either in a spatial sense, that is, among contemporaneous animals, or in a temporal sense, among suc- cessive animals. As regards seriation, he took exactly the opposite tack from Lamarck, holding that dealing with single organs or particular details one can often put together a series of linear increasing complexity but not in the overall characteristics of animals. He maintained and adequately demonstrated espe- cially in the Règne animal (1817) that there is no one basic, serial plan toward which animals progress as one follows them along a scale or ladder. He recognized four fully basic plans or types, his "embranchements," along with innumerable lesser</page><page sequence="5">32 SOCIAL RESEARCH types. He noted that even within one embranchement it is usually impossible to establish one overall progression. Thus Eiseley was curiously and completely wrong when he hailed Cuvier as giving "the impetus to biological progressionism . . . the clear prelude to nineteenth century evolution." 7 The fact that Cuvier was a violent antievolutionist is irrevelant in this respect. It was his intention and largely his accomplishment to demolish the only basis available for progressionism in either an evolutionary or a nonevolutionary context. The situation has been more clearly described and analyzed by Coleman.8 Cuvier's conception of what we now call taxa (at various levels) as invariable types is truly antievolutionary and is thoroughly dis- credited today. Nevertheless, his substitution of an elaborate, multiply diversified pattern of animal structure instead of the single, linear arrangement of the échelle was valid and is basic for evolutionary theory. Although even now not all evolutionists seem to have grasped this fact, it eliminated the possibility of a linear, Lamarckian, great chain sort of progress in evolution. Thereafter, to be valid, search for a progressionist element in evolution had to be sought elsewhere, if anywhere. Some Definitions and Concepts Here we must pause in the inquiry and consider some questions of definition and concept which have often obscured and con- fused discussions of this topic. A progression, as the term has here been used and is usually used, is "a continuous and con- nected series." 9 In our context the series consists of organisms 7 Loren Eiseley, Darwin's Century (Garden City: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1958), p. 88. s William R. Coleman, Georges Cuvier, Zoologist (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1964), especially chap. 6. 9 Webster's New International Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd ed. (Springfield: G. and C. Merriam Company, 1948). This is a more reliable guide to usage than the now current third edition.</page><page sequence="6">PROGRESS IN ORGANIC EVOLUTION 33 or more particularly of animals. The supposed progression was originally, even for Lamarck, spatial and not temporal. Lamarck theoretically equated his spatial progression with a temporal progression. In principle or philosophy, temporal progression is not necessarily evolutionary, although Lamarck's was, in a somewhat vague way. At that time paleontologists had already established the fact that different rock strata, deposited in suc- cession, contain different fossils. Cuvier was among the pioneers in establishing that remarkably fruitful avenue of research.10 Cuvier did not believe that sequence to be a progression, as that word is here defined. However, some of his immediate successors did, considering that the succession resulted from a long progres- sion of separate divine creations, each more complex. That is a side path not to be followed here beyond pointing out that pre-Darwinian progressionists were not necessarily or usually evolutionists. A distinction between succession and progression must be em- phasized. Succession means only the occurrence of different entities (here taxa of organisms) at different times. Progression means that they formed a continuous series. Cuvier observed a succession of fossils; he did not believe in progression. The distinction that has been and continues to be a still more important source of confusion is between "progression" and "progress." Succession means no more than change in time; progression indicates, or should indicate, no more than that the changes are continuous and connected, hence by an extension of concept more or less gradual; progress means, or should mean, that the changes are for the better. The early proponents of progression took it for granted that one direction of any progres- sion is toward the better. Those who espoused temporal pro- gression, whether evolutionary or not, took it for granted that the direction in time was that of progress, for the better, from simple to complex, from low to high, from "infusoria" (some of which 10 Georges Cuvier, Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles, 3rd ed. (Paris: Dufour et d'Ocagne, 1825).</page><page sequence="7">34 SOCIAL RESEARCH we would now call prokaryotes, simplest surviving forms of life) to man, who is of course the best existing or conceivable organism. On those principles, it was neither necessary nor possible to distinguish between progression and progress. Yet, as will be shown, by later evolutionary theory one cannot assume a priori that evolution proceeds either in progression or with progress. That is, whether evolution overall or in particular incidents has involved progression and whether it has involved progress are two different questions which must be investigated separately. Failure to separate them, still rather common, stultifies proper investigation of the concept and the presence or absence of progress. The confusion has become linguistic. ' 'Progression" is authori- tatively defined without reference to progress in the sense of im- provement or advance, but "progressionism" is customarily de- fined as involving progress in that sense and then essentially synonymous with the now nearly obsolete word "progressism." From this point onward I will distinguish progression and prog- ress and will consider progressionism to involve only the former and progressism the latter. Whether evolutionary change has occurred requires no discussion here. Whether or to what extent it has been by progression will have brief further notice. Whether and to what extent progress has been involved contin- ues as the main topic of enquiry. Darwin Darwin grew up at a time and among associates inbued with concepts of progress. In the social sphere those involved belief in the progress of man from savage to British gentlemen and sometimes even in the further perfectibility perhaps not of British gentlemen but of societies in general. The biological sphere was still haunted by the échelle des êtres, with, again, the British gentleman on the top rung of the ladder, or as the last link in</page><page sequence="8">PROGRESS IN ORGANIC EVOLUTION 35 the great chain. There had already been considerable interaction between the social and the biological concepts, as witness Con- dorcet as early as 1795: ' 'Organic perfectibility or deterioration . . . can be regarded as one of the general laws of nature. This law also applies to the human race." n (Condorcet's inclusion of deterioration, antiprogress, was exceptional.) Although Dar- win denied that when he wrote The Origin of Species the subject of evolution was in the air,12 the ideas of progression and progress certainly were. In The Origin of Species (1859) and later works Darwin dis- carded out of hand the old échelle des êtres, the concept of single progression that was also progressist. Nevertheless, Darwin was progressionist in a proper but more restricted sense. He believed that in any, or almost any, given case evolution has proceeded by continuous gradual changes in series, that is, by progression as here defined. However, he clearly grasped the necessary con- clusion that there has been not one progression but multitudes of them and that the lineages of progressions, the sequences of ancestors and descendants, have continually branched, giving rise to new, divergent species, genera, and higher taxa. He granted the rare occurrence of what he called ' 'sports" and we call "mutants" that might possibly create a gap in continuity, but he gave them little notice and one gets the impression that he did not seriously believe in them as effective exceptions to the old rule that "nature makes no jump" (natura non facit saltum), a preevolutionary, progressionist dictum. There has been much discussion of that point by later and modern evolutionists. We now know that the ultimate source of variation in populations, a necessary but not sufficient condition ii Marquis de Condorcet, Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind, translated by June Barraclough (New York: Noonday Press, 1955), p. 199. 12 See Charles Darwin, The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809-1882, edited by Nora Barlow (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1958).

Mutations, of any kind, are discrete events. In them nature does make a jump, but a tiny one. It is unusual for such a jump, in itself, to form a new species, still less a genus or higher taxon. A mutation takes place in an individual, and individuals do not evolve; only populations do. Thus for a mutation to lead directly and at once to an appreciable evolutionary change, the saltatory origin of a new taxon, the mutant individual must give rise directly to a new population. The circumstances under which this can occur are exceptional and the mutations that make it possible are rare. Thus the continuity of populations in progres- sions is almost always maintained and evolution is almost always gradual in that sense. Within the period of modern Mendelian genetics but before discovery of the chemical (molecular) nature of the genetic material, some hypotheses of saltatory evolution were proposed. For example, the geneticist Goldschmidt suggested that great evolutionary changes might arise from one-step change in the genetic system as a whole, so-called systemic mutations more radical than any that had actually been observed.13 The paleon- tologist Schindewolf suggested that even ordinary mutations might have radical effects if they affected early stages in individual development (ontogeny, embryology).14 However, it was soon evident that available evidence opposed those and related hypoth- eses,15 and present knowledge of genetics and molecular biology virtually excludes them.16 The only processes known to produce what might be called "instant species" occur mainly in plants, is Richard B.

Even by this process (polyploidy) the break in progression is slight. Thus in this respect Darwin is essentially confirmed. The normal or usual course of evolution is by progression within populations. It should further be noted that Darwin's progressions, and those of modern evolutionists, are strictly temporal. In the first edition of the Origin Darwin already made it clear that it is rarely possible to form a progression in any considerable group of recent (or other contemporaneous) organisms and that when a progression may be seen in a limited series of such organisms this does not necessarily follow the sequence in which its members evolved. That in itself should have sufficed to shatter, once and for all, the concept of the échelle des êtres with its supposedly built-in, overall progression and progress. So much for progression and also for the older, naive, Leibniz- ian-Lamarckian concept of progress. There remains the prob- lem whether progress is inherent in some other sense in Darwinian and later schemata of evolution. That is the most important subject of the present study, but it is particularly difficult to pin down as regards Darwin himself. He did not discuss progress as a specified topic, and one must infer his views on it from a large body of statements with apparently relevant implications. Darwin stated clearly two observations that oppose the idea of progress as an inherent characteristic of evolution. He noted that numerous organisms have persisted for geologically long periods without apparent change. If progress is inherent in evo- lution, it still did not affect them. Darwin also noted that from any one time in the past it appears that more species (or other taxa) became extinct than survived. For them, a majority, prog- ress was at most a limited thing. Both of those observations have been strongly confirmed and extended since Darwin. There are the so-called living fossils, still extant but little changed from</page><page sequence="11">38 SOCIAL RESEARCH fossil ancestors of tens or hundreds of millions of years ago.17 Lately, fossils of previously unimaginably great age, from two to three billion (thousand million) years old, have been found.18 They closely resemble organisms still very much with us (blue- green algae and bacteria), and for these, again, progress seems an inappropriate concept - although that statement will later be qualified. Extinction is a word that is confusingly used in two senses. We call a species extinct, even though it has living descendants, if those descendants have changed enough to be named differently. A species is also called extinct if it has no descendants now living. It would be clearer to call the latter kind of extinction "termina- tion." It is not possible to obtain exact figures, but there can be no doubt that the vast majority of species that ever lived, probably well over 99 percent, have terminated. Thus it can be said that the usual and in that sense the inherent or normal outcome of evolution is terminal extinction. The concept of progress must become quite special if it is to be applied to progressions that normally lead to their own termination. Yet, while Darwin recognized and even stressed the existence of arrested evolution and of extinction, he did look upon evolu- tion as generally involving progress. He even explained extinc- tion as essential for progress, as it made possible the replacement of less by more perfected organisms, whether by descent with modification or by some less related incursive group. (Darwin did not clearly distinguish the two kinds of extinction.) He did not originate nor fully espouse the expression "survival of the fittest/' but almost always he assumed that natural selection was indeed selection of the fittest, that is, the best or most progressive 17 George G.

Only in discussing civilized man 19 did he clearly recognize that natural selection might have a "downward ten- dency." Then, after looking at the matter from every side, he seemed to feel, although not clearly, that there are sufficient checks against the tendency. He cited Bagehot and Maine in favor of the view that progress is not normal in human society, yet he was quite sure that there is a "scale of civilisation" (his British spelling) and that civilized societies have risen in it from savagery by natural selection. He consistently referred to the rise of man from "lower" animals, an intentional value judgment, and even saw progress throughout the Phylum Vertebrata as animals be- came less fishlike and more manlike, a concept not far from the échelle and Lamarck. What Is or May Be Progress? It will clarify matters if we now mention some of the things that have been considered to be progress in evolution. So many things have been so considered that they can indeed be only exemplified. Our inquiry will then continue and close with discussion of the probable status of such examples in the light of present knowledge of the course and the processes of evolution. For a start, it is interesting to note what Lamarck considered the principal features of the progressist échelle.20 Paraphrased and summarized they are: 1. Movement of fluids. (Origin and evolution of a circulatory system.) 2. Reproduction, from simple fission to egg-laying to live-birth. 3. Faculty of sensation. (Origin of nerves, with eventual origin of various sense organs.) is Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (Lon- don: John Murray, 1871). 20 Lamarck, Histoire naturelle, I, 210-211.</page><page sequence="13">40 SOCIAL RESEARCH 4. Intelligence. (Absent before origin of a brain and culmi- nating, of course, in man.) All of those features have also repeatedly been stressed by later evolutionists, although rarely as evidence of a single and inherent tendency in evolution. Since no one can doubt that the very earliest organisms lacked a circulatory system, nerves, and a brain, and that they reproduced by fission, it is clear that these changes did occur somewhere and sometime in the course of evolution. The questions are whether they were general ten- dencies and in what sense they can be considered improvements. Another approach, especially popular in the latter part of the nineteenth century, is that of the so-called evolutionary "laws." In more modern times these have been emphasized by Rensch, a particularly able biologist.21 Rensch believes that such laws are rigid and absolute, with the result that everything in evolution was predetermined from the start, a point of view followed to full philosophical conclusions in a later book.22 He recognizes nevertheless that the "laws" have many descriptive exceptions, caused (in his opinion) by the facts that circumstances alter the applicable "laws" and that different "laws" interact or interfere with each other in different cases. In practice, then, he calls them "rules," and he has enumerated more than sixty differ- ent "rules" for mammals and birds alone. A particularly broad example, one to which Rensch long devoted special attention,23 is what he calls "Cope's law," that the size of individual animals tends to become larger in the course of evolution. Such "laws" or "rules" are in fact only empirical generalizations as to what has usually or in some cases only what has often oc- 21 Bernhard Rensch, Evolution above the Species Level, translated by Dr. Altevogt (New York: Columbia University Press, 1960) and "The Laws of Evolution," in Sol Tax, ed., The Evolution of Life (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960), I, 95-116. 22 Bernhard Rensch, Biophilosophy , translated by C. A. M. Sym (New York: Columbia University Press, 1971). 23 See especially Rensch, Evolution above the Species Level.</page><page sequence="14">PROGRESS IN ORGANIC EVOLUTION 41 curred. Some, like "Cope's law/' are rather widely based. Others refer only to particular groups, sometimes only to a single class, order, or lesser taxon. They are thus really ad hoc descriptions. When considered as progressist, they almost always appear to be adaptive for just the groups that do in fact manifest them, and thus support only a concept of progress also strictly ad hoc. We will have occasion to revert to that point. An evolutionary phenomenon already noted by Darwin and often given as an example of progress is that of increasing diversity and accompanying divergence of organisms. Thus Barghoorn speaks of progress from the oldest fossils known at present, over three billion years, to those a billion years later because the latter, more varied as now known, "had crossed . . . the threshold of diversification." 24 Because it is incredible that life originated in the form of millions of species all at once, it seems certain that there has been an enormous increase in the diversity of organisms. Still it is clear that the increase has not been steady from the origin of life to the present and has not followed any simple or inherent law. In other respects its course is still a matter of dispute.25 The fact of diversification, without other considerations per- haps more readily ascribed to progress, necessarily entails changes that are progressions if not progresses. Thus perhaps the most solidly established "law" or "rule," that of increase in size, auto- matically follows from diversification. Some lineages will neces- sarily increase in size with normal diversification. From a small ancestry, certainly true of earliest organisms and observed for many later episodes, the majority of lineages and the average of all must increase in individual size, regardless of anything except mere increase in diversity.26 24 Barghoorn, "The Oldest Fossils." 25 See especially D.

Stanley, "An Explanation of Cope's Rule," Evolution, XXVII (1973), 1-26.</page><page sequence="15">42 SOCIAL RESEARCH Here I introduce a brief digression just to avoid an omission that some might consider serious. This is the belief, related to a possible concept of progress, that evolution has followed, is following, a divine plan toward a transcendental end. This is an adaptation to evolutionary terms of preevolutionary and now usually antievolutionary creationism and providentialism. It has had other gurus and disciples, but in recent years it has been most popular among lay followers of Father Teilhard de Chardin. As Teilhard was both a Jesuit and a paleontologist, it has been claimed both by himself and by nonpaleontological followers that his progressist religious view of evolution was based on scientific knowledge of the course of evolution. In fact that is not true. It is entirely evident from Teilhard's work that his mystical theory of evolution is not based on and even contradicts his own obser- vations and completely ignores scientific knowledge of evolution.27 If evidence outside the field of paleontology is sought, Dobzhan- sky, the most eminent student of genetic evolution, has written: If evolution has followed a path which is predestined (ortho- genesis), or if it is propelled and guided toward some goal by divine interventions (finalism), then its meaning becomes a tan- talizing, and even distressing, puzzle. If the universe was destined to advance toward some state of absolute beauty and goodness, the design was incredibly faulty.28 What Dobzhansky there strongly repudiates is precisely Teil- hardian progressism. It may seem anomalous that it was written in the course of a chapter enthusiastically praising Teilhard, but the chapter significantly concludes: "It is evidently the inspiration of a mystic, not a process of inference from scientific data, that 27 George G. Simpson, "On the Remarkable Testament of the Jesuit Paleontolo- gist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin," Scientific American, CCII (April 1960), 201-207, and "The Divine Non Sequitur," address delivered at the Teilhard Symposium of the University of California in San Francisco, 1971, and published in Géraldine O.

I now return to scientific ideas about progress, but for the moment will postpone consideration of some further biological exemplars to give a more recent example from outside the field of evolutionary biology, strictly speaking. The psychologist Cat- tell (cited at the outset of this discussion), having decided that contribution to evolutionary advance is to be "the ultimate touch- stone of moral behavior," faces the question: "What is evolu- tionary advance?" 30 He first discards straight-line advance, which he says is unacceptable since Morgan pointed out the phenomenon of émergents.81 It is not too important that that is bad history. Without using the term, Lamarck was already quite clear (for him) on émergents within straight-line advance and Darwin was quite clear (for anyone) about them in divergent multilinear advances. Cattell then mentions the concept that "more evolved" forms, with "more elaborate differentiation of organs," are higher or more advanced, but raises the important, legitimate question whether they are only later, not also better. He suggests that the real point is that they are adapted to a "wider range of circum- stances" and thus have "better chances of survival." However, after some backing and filling he decides that "mere length of survival will not do." He then suggests criteria for advance or its lack. Here abbreviated and paraphrased, these are: 1. In the same environment, those species which fail are some- how inadequate. 2. Organ complexity if correlated with superior function weighs on the side of advance. 2» Ibid., p. 137. so For "advance" one can obviously read "progress"; the discussion is in Cattell, A New Morality, pp. 86-90. si Conwyn L. Morgan, Emergent Evolution (New York: Holt, 1923).</page><page sequence="17">44 SOCIAL RESEARCH 3. In equivalent environments, the more abundant species are "more successful" (hence presumably more advanced?). 4. Complexity and breadth of environment to which an or- ganism can adapt promotes survival through changes of environ- ment and is "most fundamental" for definition of advanced or higher species. 5. Species are more advanced in proportion as they are aware of and able to control their environments. 6. It is cautiously presented as a bare possibility that a reverse in direction of evolution can be considered an advance. Cattell is there attempting a definition for evolutionary ad- vance in general, not one ad hoc with respect to the human species. He later discusses the latter point of view, of special interest to psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists. In- deed, he has not avoided it in listing the preceding criteria. The first criterion suggests that mere survival represents prog- ress, and this has been variously proposed by biologists as well. Obviously the failure to survive precludes further progress, and survival is a necessary condition for possible further progress. It is also beyond much question that survival is better than termination, but it is specious to say that because it is better in that sense it represents progress. Survival in itself is not change for the better and hence is not (again, in itself) progress. It is criteria 2-5 that are increasingly ad hoc, that is, they are increasingly special to particular groups of organisms and not characteristic of evolution as a whole. With criterion 5 it be- comes apparent that the criterion aims toward men; it singles out the ultimately unique lineage now represented solely by Homo sapiens and is not a clearly applicable criterion for progress in millions of other lineages that have occurred. As for 6, it is almost self-contradictory, and Cattell himself is not sold on it. Thus Cattell's general criteria for evolutionary progress are not clearly general or wholly tenable. That is largely because he has inherited some ambiguity and confusion from some bio-</page><page sequence="18">PROGRESS IN ORGANIC EVOLUTION 45 logical, and possibly in part also from some psychological, sources. That has been the reason for summarizing a psychologist's views here, and I now return to biology. Haldane and Huxley J. B. S. Haldane and Julian Huxley are among the founding fathers of the modern theory of evolution. They also are among the relatively few leading biologists who have discussed the topic of progress in evolution explicitly and fruitfully, Haldane espe- cially in The Causes of Evolution (1932) and Huxley especially in Evolution the Modern Synthesis (1942 and 1963). Haldane first noted that several ancient lines, once dominant in their environments, changed "about as often in the direction of simplification as complication'* and ultimately terminated. He specified only insects and vertebrates as having "shown marked progress/' but noted that in them, too, "there has been much degeneration." For both groups he gives the development of wings as an example of true progress, but adds that "for every form which has improved, dozens have degenerated. . . . The ostriches and their allies, the dodo, the kiwi, the flightless parrots and rails of New Zealand, have all lost their flying power and gained nothing in exchange." 32 There even Haldane betrayed a common human failing, the tendency to believe that because one does not forthwith under- stand the causes for an evolutionary change, it has no compre- hensible cause or adaptive reason. (There is now a small but vocal school of molecular biologists that has fallen into a com- parable error.) The majority of flightless birds, ancient and re- cent, when they lost flight gained the possibility of greater bulk and more rapid running than is compatible with flight. The smaller flightless birds, all island dwellers, which cannot be a 32 J. B. S.

It is not meaningfully "de- generation" to lose something useless. These are all simply examples of change in adaptation, and in a general sense such change is not clearly either progress or regression. It can be taken as progress in a strictly ad hoc sense. For the ancestors of ostriches, once started on an adaptive change toward increase of bulk and decrease of flight, it was progress to increase bulk beyond possibility of flight. For ancestral eagles such a change would have been degeneration, but it did not occur in them. One can thus argue, or quibble, over particular points in Haldane's discussion. His conclusions are perhaps also arguable in detail but cannot be considered false in general: Certainly the study of evolution does not point to any general tendency of species to progress. The animal and plant community as a whole does show such a tendency, but this is because every now and then an evolutionary advance is rewarded by a very large increase in numbers, rather than because such advances are common.33 Haldane was also quite aware that most concepts of progress, including some of his own, were ad hoc with respect to Homo sapiens, although he expressed the matter in different and more diverting ways: The change from monkey to man might well seem a change for the worse to a monkey. But it might also seem so to an angel. The monkey is quite a satisfactory animal. Man of to-day is probably an extremely primitive and imperfect type of rational being. He is a worse animal than the monkey. . . . We must remember that when we speak of progress in evolution we are already leaving the relatively firm ground of scientific objectivity for the shifting morass of human values.34 Huxley has cited various objections to the concept of evolution- 33 ibid., p. 153. 34/fciU, p. 154.</page><page sequence="20">PROGRESS IN ORGANIC EVOLUTION 47 ary progress.35 He controverted them mainly by admitting and stressing from the start that progress is not general in evolution. We have repeatedly noted that conclusion, and in 1974 it can be taken as completely, factually established. We have at least come that far from Lamarck, and even from Darwin, for we no longer believe in the usual survival of the fittest if "fittest" is used in the colloquial sense. Huxley has then gone on with great confidence to propose and define his own concept of evolutionary progress. He based his concept on a "succession of ... dominant types," naming trilobites (extinct crustaceanlike animals), eurypterids (extinct scorpionlike animals), ostracoderms (fishlike relatives of the lampreys), early true fishes, early insects and amphibians (simultaneously), ad- vanced fishes and advanced insects and reptiles (all three simul- taneously), and birds and mammals (simultaneously). Seeking what all those "dominant types" have in common, Huxley con- cluded that all their distinguishing characteristics either make for greater control over the environment or make for greater independence from the environment. In work published be- tween the two editions of the book already cited, Huxley added various more specific points, including increase in complexity, individuation, capacity for knowledge, emotion, and purpose, and finally a sense of values.36 Huxley saw that his view might be considered anthropo- morphic, or what I have been calling ad hoc with respect to Homo sapiens, but he rejected the criticism and insisted that his definition of progress is objective and general. A typical counter- argument was that man does possess "greater power over nature" and does live "in greater independence of his environment than any monkey." In accord with that line of thought and his gen- 35 Julian S. Huxley, Evolution the Modern Synthesis, 2nd ed. (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1963), pp. 556-578. 36 Julian S. Huxley, New Bottles for New Wine (New York: Harper and Bros., 1957), pp. 21-25, 291-292.</page><page sequence="21">48 SOCIAL RESEARCH eral concept oí progress, Huxley concluded that all previous dominant types are either extinct or in dead ends and that the possibility for future evolutionary progress exists in man alone. There can be no greater authority on this subject, and yet as I have suggested elsewhere,37 Huxley's arguments are open to some grave objections. His basic evidence, the "succession of ... dominant types," is not really an evolutionary succession. Not in time, because, as he noted, two or more different "types" repeat- edly became dominant at the same time. Not in descent, because none of his later "dominant types" was in fact descended from his earlier ones. Not in successively taking over the same sphere, because hardly any two of the "dominant types" really were or are in the same sphere or, broadly, adaptive zone. Birds do not replace fishes, and reptiles do not even replace amphibians. Each of Huxley's "dominant types" was highly successful for a time, at least, and several of them (advanced insects, advanced fishes, birds, mammals) still are, even though several others are extinct. It is legitimate to inquire what made each so successful, and it is an acceptable concept that the acquisition of character- istics leading to success was progress in each case. However, it is not true that success was due to the same kinds of characteristics in each case or that a real succession can be made of acquisition of increasingly successful adaptations in the cited "dominant types." The point becomes fairly clear if one takes into consideration other groups that seem surely dominant, each in its own sphere, and yet have few or none of the characteristics by which Huxley defined progress. Examples: bacteria, almost certainly the most abundant of all organisms; rodents, surely now a dominant group of land mammals; gastropods (snails and their allies), dominant bottom-livers (benthos) of many waters; not to mention plants such as algae in the waters and flowering plants (angiosperms) on land. Despite his disclaimer, Huxley's concept of progress really is 37 Especially Simpson, The Meaning of Evolution, pp. 239-262.</page><page sequence="22">PROGRESS IN ORGANIC EVOLUTION 49 ad hoc and anthropomorphic. To point out that man has more power over nature and also more independence from it merely emphasizes the point: man is a specialist in manipulating his environment (not always to his advantage) and in doing so is more human than monkeys are. That is a legitimate human concept of progress. It does not follow and the evidence does not support the proposition that other organisms progressed, became "higher," because of and in proportion to their acquisition of characteristics most highly developed in man. What, Again and Finally, Is Evolutionary Progress? Our inquiry has not produced an unequivocal definition of evolutionary progress, and citation of more authorities and more examples would not improve the situation. We may reasonably feel with Haldane that defining progress takes us into "the shifting morass of human values/' Yet it is not true that value judgments are foreign to science. No scientific endeavor can be undertaken without some such judgment, and there must be a sense in which we can sometimes judge whether particular evolutionary changes are for the better. We can perhaps best clarify the matter briefly starting with what has happened to the "survival of the fittest." It is now widely agreed that the directional, guiding factor in evolution is natural selection acting on variation in populations. Variation arises from mutations, which are strictly limited as to their possi- ble directions but nevertheless are not oriented in the direction of adaptation or improvement or indeed in the direction actually being taken by the evolution of the population in question. Mu- tations thus are random in the sense of lacking such orientation, and so are some processes that recombine and modify the variants in populations, but natural selection is not random in that sense. Modern geneticists have redefined "fitness," which they some- times call "Darwinian fitness" although it is not what Darwin</page><page sequence="23">50 SOCIAL RESEARCH usually had in mind.38 This fitness is proportional to a "selection coefficient" which measures the contribution of parents with certain genes to the total genetic makeup (gene pool) of the next generation.39 The intensity of natural selection is now under- stood to be measured by this coefficient, hence by fitness in this special sense. In other words, natural selection depends on how many offspring parents with distinctive genes have. It not only depends on that differential reproduction, it is that by definition. In fact, change in one generation by such a process is not necessar- ily significant; to be of evolutionary significance, selection as differential reproduction must continue over a sequence of gen- erations, but that is a complication we need not worry overmuch about. Hence "fitness," as now defined, is just long-run relative suc- cess in reproduction by parents with certain heritable character- istics. This does not necessarily have much to do with fitness in the vernacular sense. It commonly does favor the fittest in that sense, too, but can well lead to what is generally considered degeneration. If the parental generation is already adapted, selection will prevent evolutionary change. If the environment changes, or organisms move into a new environment, selection will promote change in adaptive type if suitable variation occurs. We have noted that such change in adaptation is just that and not ipso facto improvement or progress. Now we come around to what Huxley and indeed all of our authorities have been saying in various ways and within various, sometimes fallible theoretical frameworks. Some organisms are better than their ancestors or than some of their relatives at doing certain things in certain ways. Some oysters are better at being oysters than their ancestors. Some trees are better at living on 38 Only in The Descent of Man and in discussing modern human populations did Darwin clearly and consistently relate selection to fitness in the modern genetical sense. 39 For a brief, clear discussion see Dobzhansky, Genetics of the Evolutionary Process, pp. 101-104.</page><page sequence="24">PROGRESS IN ORGANIC EVOLUTION 51 mountain tops than others. We are doubtless better at being men than Australopithecus was, although I go along with Hal- dane far enough to believe that monkeys are better at being monkeys than we would be even if we tried. It is also true that sometimes whole groups have been carried by selection to a point where their great expansion into various adaptive zones became possible, a progressive feature of evolution for which the some- what confusing term "potential versatility" has lately been intro- duced.40 That is the explanation, in unduly broad terms, of the spread of dominant groups from time to time. With such examples it is perfectly reasonable to say that im- provement has factually occurred and that there is therefore evolutionary progress. The progress is, however, ad hoc in every case. Our ancestors' progress was not the oysters', the trees', or the monkeys', nor was theirs ours. Since we are humans, after all, the most interesting and important progress is progress to- ward us, but let us not mistake this for a general phenomenon. Probably the most important result of this somewhat dispersive inquiry is negative: there is no innate tendency toward evolu- tionary progress and no one, overall sort of such progress. We cannot sit back and assume that natural selection will lead to progress for us, or for anything else. We cannot even assume that prolongation of past progress would continue to be progress.41 40 G. J. Vermeij, "Biological Versatility and Earth History," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, LXX (1973), 1936-1938. 4i Since this essay was completed, I have received a book exactly on this subject and too important to neglect: L. Sh. Davitashvili, The Problem of Evolutionary Progress (The Theory of Aromorphosis) (Tbilisi: Metsniereba, 1972), in Russian with very brief summaries in English and Georgian. Professor Davitashvili follows the history of philosophical and biological concepts of progress, including Russian studies little known in the West. He gives many and detailed examples of limited and general progression, especially from the fossil record. Using other terms, he emphasizes the ad hoc nature of most cited instances of progress in evolution, but believes that more general progress occurs in changes that are not only adaptive to single environments but also are prospectively more widely useful in other environ- ments. There is no other recent book with such extensive data and discussion on these topics.</page></plain_text>
