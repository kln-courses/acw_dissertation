<plain_text><page sequence="1">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 77 Notes Toward a Theory of Values: Values as Cultural W. W. MEISSNER, S.J. In our previous considerations of the notion of "value," we were concerned primarily with the clarification of our thinking about values on a restric tively psychological level.1 At the same time, it was apparent that the in trapsychic aspect of value, while quite valid and substantive in itself, could not remain an isolated consideration. While the structure of values can be defined in terms of intrapsychic functions, it nonetheless turns its face to the outer world and both initiates and modifies itself by continu ing dialogue with a pre-existing climate of values. The value-system of the individual is both created and assimilated from the culture that surrounds him. Since the world of value is both within man and surrounds him, the un derstanding of value as an integrative concept must embrace both aspects. Values are operative at a psychological level and at a cultural level. Their operation at these respective levels is not altogether independent; rather there is a continual interaction between these two levels of integration. The Rev. W. W. Meissner, S.J., M.D., is affiliated with the Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston. He is an advanced candidate at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute. He spent a year during 1966-67 as research fellow at the Cambridge Center for Social Studies. His The Psychology of Authority will be published this spring. This is the last of a series of three articles. The first, subtitled "The Place of Values," was published in the April issue; the second, subtitled "Values as Psychological," appeared in the July issue.</page><page sequence="2">78 Journal of Religion and Health Our concern in this present essay is with values at the cultural level. Our interest is not so much definitional as heuristic. Clarification of the notion of cultural values serves the further purpose of deepening our understand ing of the reciprocal interplay between cultural and individual value systems. Culture Insofar as the value-system is a component of culture, it shares in the con ceptual status of culture itself. It will serve our purposes, therefore, to ex amine the concept of culture in order to provide some perspective for the understanding of values. Values enjoy the same reality and status as the culture of which they are constitutive elements. The first approach to the notion of culture is somewhat bewildering. One is overwhelmed by the diversity of opinions and viewpoints. Culture is learned behavior, or an abstraction from behavior?therefore, not be havior?or it consists of mental events, or of things and events in the ex ternal world, or of just ideas. It exists in people's minds, in the anthropol ogist's mind, or independently of either of these.2 The classic definition was that provided by E. B. Tylor. He defined culture as "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."3 The emphasis of this early formulation was on certain abstractions from the results of human behavior?knowledge, art, law, etc. Anthropology was not concerned with behavior as such. This was the province of psychology or sociology. Rather anthropology was concerned with abstract propositions about kinship systems, religious beliefs, legal codes, etc., which could be studied and described with little reference to the people involved. More over, anthropology was the science of culture as a generic phenomenon, not the study of particular cultures. The effect of this early view was to define anthropology as an independent science with its own proper object; but it also removed it from its rather obvious behavioral roots.</page><page sequence="3">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 79 As Spiro pointed out, Tylor's definition carried an inherent dualism.4 It pointed to culture as a "complex whole," but at the same time a whole that was acquired by man as a member of society. In the study of cultural evolution in abstract terms, this latter aspect could be pretty much ignored. But in the more concrete work of field study of a given society, what was its "culture" to be? Was it to be that society's social heritage, the "complex whole" that can be thought of as independent of its acquisition by the members of the society, or at least antecedent to such acquisition? Or was it to be identified with the behavior of the members of the society by which they acquire and express their social patterns? The obvious need to refine these concepts for purposes of analysis and interpretation led to a diversity of conceptions. The variety of approaches have been conveniently categorized as cultural realism, cultural idealism, and cultural nominalism.5 Cultural realism maintains that culture does not exist in the organism, that it cannot be identified with behavior, but that it has independent existence in a realm of its own?the realm of the superorganic.6 The mass of culture and its constitutive elements (values in cluded) "have a persistence and can be conceived as going on their slowly changing way 'above' or outside the societies that support them."7 The corollary of cultural realism is cultural determinism. People act in certain ways because their culture so determines, so that behavior is the orga nism's response to cultural stimuli. Human beings are thus merely instru ments for the expression of culture.8 An inherent fallacy of the realist po sition has been pointed out, namely, that if culture is superorganic with its own ontological realm of operation, how can it influence behavior?9 Cultural idealism views culture as consisting of ideal norms or patterns. Culture in this view is not to be identified with behavior, nor is it some thing external to the organism with its own independent existence. It ex ists as an idea or set of ideas in the mind of man. White suggests that be hind this approach is the notion that ideas are basic and primary and that they can initiate behavior that will produce the trappings of culture.10 But the ideas themselves need explaining, and although culture does indeed</page><page sequence="4">80 Journal of Religion and Health involve ideas, it also involves a complex of other mental acts, patterns of behavior, and objects. Many idealists speak of culture as consisting of abstractions. What the abstractions are is not clear, although it is clear that they are not observ able. Thus Kroeber and Kluckhohn describe culture as a form or pattern or way.11 Cultural traits are "ideal types" because the trait is never ex pressed in precisely the same way. The trait is, therefore, an abstraction? a conception that has the reality of an idea in the mind. Cultural idealists are logically compelled to hold that material objects are not culture, and that the concept of material culture is fallacious.12 The confusion in the ideal-abstract formulation is basically between the concept of culture, which is a logical construct in the mind of the anthropologist, and the ac tual existential culture in the real order.13 The third basic position is that of cultural nominalism, which denies all ontological standing to the concept of culture. It is neither a superorganic reality nor an idea in the minds of men. It is rather a logical construct, abstracted from human behavior, and thus exists nowhere else but in the mind of the investigator. But the construct must have some relevance to the culture it describes. The real culture embraces all the behavioral con figurations in the society, which have a range and variation. The culture construct must establish "the mode of the finite series of variations which are included within each of the real culture patterns."14 Thus the real cul ture, as far as the observer is concerned, is the actual behavior of the mem bers of the society. From these observed uniformities, the anthropologist abstracts generalizations that are called the culture of the society. Hence the culture of any society, as abstracted and recorded, is a logical construct in the anthropologist's mind.15 The nominalist approach to culture is in greatest favor currently and seems to represent a methodologically more sophisticated theory. Strictly speaking, this approach precludes any meaningful conception of cultural determinism. Constructs do not determine behavior. But many self-pro fessed nominalists speak loosely of cultural influence or determination and</page><page sequence="5">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 81 thus slip unwittingly into cultural realism. As Spiro remarked, "one sus pects that despite the methodological sophistication involved in the nomi nalistic theory, the nominalists are dissatisfied with their own formulations and, unwittingly, allow a superorganicist conception of culture to enter into their thinking."16 The problem is one that anthropological theorists share with other disciplines dealing with human behavior. It is extremely difficult to maintain a methodologically "pure" position in the face of methodologically "impure" evidences. One winds up by either outlawing methodologically unacceptable evidences, and these may be the more sig nificant evidences, or by contaminating methods, often surreptitiously.17 Thus learning theorists who professed a rigidly behaviorist and operation ist methodology found themselves introducing phenomenological elements unsystematically. Not only were such elements introduced, but the theory could not survive without them. One wonders whether the backsliding into cultural realism and concepts of cultural determinism does not have a certain survival value in the present context as well. We must remember that cultural values share in these conceptual am biguities. Values somehow pre-exist the individual, and the individual then assimilates the values resident in his culture. But the scientific men tality finds it difficult to accept the superorganic perspective. Besides, if enculturation implies only the assimilation of a previously existing culture, we are hard pressed to say how it is that culture exists at all or how culture ever began. Culture must have its source and its residence in man, but in man in such a way that its existence does not depend on the existence of this or that man, but on the existence of the group. While the realists run into logical difficulties, the idealists and nominal ists run into other problems. Culture, with its inherent value-systems, has a directive or normative aspect that leads the members of the social system to behave in a certain way because they feel that they ought to be have in that way. The realist conception of something behind behavior di recting it is perfectly consistent with this aspect of culture. But the nomi nalist approach does not explain this dynamic aspect at all. The idealist</page><page sequence="6">82 Journal of Religion and Health approach conceives of culture as ideal norms of how people ought to be have. This serves to identify the normative element, but it does not explain it, since it makes a dynamic element something static and deprives it of compelling force by insisting that there is no necessary correspondence be tween these ideal norms and actual behavior.18 Values, therefore, are con ceivable in an otherwise unacceptable approach, and are inconceivable in otherwise acceptable approaches. White tries to pick his way among these ambiguities.19 The key issue is the question whether culture is going to be regarded as behavior or as abstraction from behavior. In the former alternative, it becomes the prop erty of psychology; in the latter, anthropology is left without any real, sub stantial subject matter. He points to the class of things and events that con sist of or are dependent on symboling. These are sym bolates, and they can be considered in many different contexts. When they are considered in terms of their relationship to human organisms, the context is "somatic." When they are considered in terms of their relationship to other similar symbolates, rather than in relation to human organisms, the context is "extrasomatic." White goes on to say When things and events dependent on symboling are considered and interpreted in terms of their relationship to human organisms, i.e., in a somatic context, they may properly be called human behavior, and the science, psychology. When things and events dependent on symboling are considered and interpreted in an extrasomatic context, i.e., in terms of their relationship to one another rather than to human organisms, we may call them culture, and science, culturology. Culture, in this view, is merely symbolates considered extrasomatically. Values, then, are a subset of the class of symbolates which can be regarded somatically or extrasomatically, i.e., from the psychological or the cultural side. However regarded, it is the same set of events which is involved. By inference, therefore, the cultural and the psychological approaches to values are talking about the same reality.</page><page sequence="7">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 83 Culture and personality The consideration of values has been carried on at both the cultural and the psychological levels in relative independence. However, under the im petus of interpersonal interests stimulated largely by Sullivan, there has grown up a culture-and-personality literature of some importance. The anthropological interest in this area came at the hands of Benedict, Mead, Linton, and LaBarre. The more psychiatric interest was found in Kardi ner, Fromm, and Erikson. These overlapping interests stemmed from an appreciation that the character of the individual personality was somehow shaped by the culture in which he lived. It is interesting that most of the early thinking was governed by a basically psychoanalytic model of the bio logically given, instinct-based, organism, which undergoes cultural modi fication and socialization as the result of interaction with other culturally formed persons. Conceptually, there was difficulty in formulating ideas about culture and personality in such a way as to maintain their autonomy, yet in so doing to develop the understanding of their continuity and interaction. Thus Lass well trying to expand the interpersonal frame of reference could offer some working definitions: "Personality" is the term used to refer to the way a person acts toward other per sons. "Culture" is the term used to refer to the way that the members of a group act in relation to one another and to other groups. A "group" is composed of per sons. A "person" is an individual who identifies himself with others.20 The sense of group identity and interaction is inherent in the concept of culture, and the context of cultural exchange defines and establishes the individual personality. This tendency to continuity of definition issued in the conception of culture as a system that operates to maintain a pattern of subjective events. The pattern is maintained by a process of dynamic equilibriums in which distortion or interference at one point in the system activates adaptive mechanisms in other parts of the system to restore the</page><page sequence="8">84 Journal of Religion and Health pattern of equilibrium. The personality is articulated within the more gen eral cultural system as a specific subsystem, which is geared to maintain ing a certain degree of internal consistency while at the same time it is dy namically responsive to alterations in other (personal) subsystems that may impose adaptive demands on it. The study of personality consisted in analysis of the totality of component relationships and situations within the culture and the interaction between cultures. The conceptual models, as Kluckhohn and Mowrer suggested, were more in terms of "culture in personality" and "personality in culture" than "culture and personality."21 These authors, in their elaborate systematizing attempt, displayed the complexities of variation and continuity involved in dealing with these problems. "Any consideration of 'personality in culture' must be carried on within the framework of a complex conceptual scheme which explicitly recognizes instead of tacitly excluding a number of classes of determi nants."22 Personality is the individual's social stimulus value and any at tempt to describe an individual's personality must be based specifically on the regularities in stimulus value which the individual has for others. They distinguish the determinants of personality, the "classes of forces which may be abstracted out as influencing social stimulus value," from its com ponents, "those facets of the social stimulus value of the individual as an integrate in action which may be regarded as produced primarily by one or another of the classes of determinants."23 The determinants are de scribed in quantitative (universal, communal, role, and idiosyncratic) and qualitative (biological, physical-environmental, social, and cultural) terms. Thus cultural determinants may be universal (incest tabu), communal (tra ditions, manners), role-related (doctor, father), and idiosyncratic. The complexity of the undertaking is apparent. In general, the more complex the issues, the greater the danger of stumbling into pitfalls. The culture-and-personality investigations preoccupied themselves with trying to describe and characterize certain cultural configurations and to estab lish certain related personality types. The link was conceived in terms of cultural determinism, but among the multiple influences special empha</page><page sequence="9">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 85 sis was given to early childhood interpersonal relations. The enterprize has enjoyed limited success and has been severely criticized for its meth ods and for the logic of the approach. For example, Lindesmith and Strauss have criticized these studies on grounds of circularity of proof, im munity to negative evidence, confusion between fact and the investigator's interpretations of fact, inadequate evaluation of the investigator's influ ence on the situation and the data, and the operation of Western biases and "projective systems."24 The role of infant experience has been a crucial area of investigation in attempts to bridge the gap between pre-existing culture and the develop ing personality. Under the strong influence of psychoanalytic theory, the predominant character-forming influence of the infant disciplines (nurs ing, weaning, mothering, bowel-and-bladder training, etc.) has been em phasized. But the evidence is not as good as one might wish, carrying with it a setting of anthropomorphism and unsupported assumption.25 There is general agreement, of course, that the assumption of the significance of early learning is quite valid, but what precisely is learned and how it in fluences later development are still unsettled issues. If we recall White's division of culture and personality, their common re lation to symbol-dependent events (symbolates) becomes the crucial focus for culture-personality interactions.26 The most important set of sym bolates in this delicate area of interactions is that of values. The symbolates, and values among them, form a series of real events with ob jective reality. Whether these real events are considered in relation to each other (extrasomatically, culturally) or in relation to the organism as such (somatically, psychologically) does not in any way change the objective reality of the events in question. This is a most important epistemological point for the consideration of values. If we ask how the cultural value-sys tem relates to and influences the individual value-system, we are equiva lently asking about the relation of a set of symbolates regarded extrasomati cally to another set of symbolates regarded somatically. If we are really to make sense out of our question, we must cast the question in one modality</page><page sequence="10">86 Journal of Religion and Health or the other. We must regard the value-system of the culture (society) so matically, or we must regard the individual value-system extrasomatically. Changing the context of consideration, moreover, does not change the symbolates. If we then ask what is the objective reality of the symbolates, the value-systems, it is our position that the reality of the individual value system is that of an individual psychic structure, as a major component of the real person. The reality of the cultural value-system is different. Its reality is nothing other than the reality of individual value-systems, but these individual systems demonstrate common elements that can be ab stracted and logically constructed as a value-system of the group. Thus the objective reality of the symbolates is unaffected by our constructions. The question of the influence of cultural value-systems is equivalently a ques tion about the impact on one individual value-system (regarded somatical ly) of another individual value-system or value-systems (regarded somati cally) that can be regarded as sharing a determinable set of value ele ments. The multiplicity of value-systems involved is determined by refer ence to the culture of a specific group, whether family, or town, or state, or country, or whatever grouping is in question. Culture and values The interaction of personality and culture makes it apparent that they are dependent on and related to the same set of real events. The development of human personality and human culture, both phylogenetically and onto genetically, runs a parallel course. As Hallowell points out: Along with a greater diversification in the forms of social structure that charac terize Homo sapiens, we are confronted with a change in their underlying dy namics. At this more advanced stage, societies function as moral orders. It is this fact that gives us the major key to the kind of psychological transformation that occurred. The functioning of a social system as a moral order implies a capacity for self objectification, self-identification, and appraisal of one's own conduct, as well as</page><page sequence="11">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 87 that of others, with reference to socially recognized and sanctioned standards of behavior. Without a psychological level of organization that permits the exercise of these functions, moral responsibility for conduct could not exist, nor could any social structure function as a moral order.27 The capacity for self-objectification, identification, and reference of con duct to standards (valuation) depends on the development of ego-func tions as well as on the capacity for symbolic projection of experience in terms that are meaningful and intelligible to other individuals. Culture and the organization of society required the evaluation of a new principle of symbolic interaction, which itself derived from the prior development of a capacity for extrinsic symbolic representation.28 As Hallowell puts it, "extrinsic symbolic systems, functioning through vocal, graphic, plastic, gestural or other media, make it possible for groups of human beings to share a common world of meanings."29 While the existence of culture depends directly on the capacity for shared meaning through extrinsic symbolic representation, man's cultural participation requires and reflects the integration of his own personality. This latter requires a capacity for intrinsic symbolic representation as well. Enculturation involves the frustration of unsocialized drives and instincts that clamor for satisfaction and cannot tolerate delay. Some adjustment is required, since his modes of need-reduction are learned in a cultural con text. The adjustments are often symbolic in nature and involve a host of unconscious symbolic mechanisms of repression, displacement, condensa tion, projection, sublimation, identification, etc.30 The mechanisms origi nate as unconscious infantile responses, but become in time the typically human mechanisms of interpersonal adjustment and intrapersonal inte gration. One can draw the conclusion that the acquisition of culture and the development of personality are really the same process. The values by which the individual regulates his behavior are a major form of symbolic representation. As Spiro indicates, "behavior, though per ceived as a series of responses, is always based on a system of values. From the tremendous number of potential, and equally effective, responses to</page><page sequence="12">88 Journal of Religion and Health any given stimulus, only a limited number are actually chosen, and the se lection of the few from the many implies a principle of selection?that is, a system of values, articulated as ideal norms, according to which the choices are made."31 Value-related behavior is associated with a feeling of Tight ness or wrongness that is part of the cultural heritage. As Hallowell put it, man's emotional nature "becomes structuralized in such a way that anxiety, guilt and depression become indices to the integrative level reached by the personal adjustments of the individual in relation to the symbolically ex pressed and mediated norms of his society."32 It is apparent that the pattern of structuralization and integration is unique to each individual and enjoys a wide range of diversity within any cultural grouping. The cultural heritage of any one person is different from that of any other in the society.33 There is no single, uniform, homo geneous culture, whatever the cultural realists may say. We can make a uni form culture by abstracting and constructing it, but the reality contains diversity. The cultural heritage to which the child is exposed is the culture of the family rather than the culture of a society. Given the diversity of fam ily cultures, there is a further distortion in the development of the per sonal cultural heritage of this individual. The necessary incorporation of values is a personal response, not merely an assimilation of pre-existing cul tural givens, but a symbolically mediated learning process in which multiple adaptive mechanisms play a role in an integrative process of per sonality formation. Each child assigns different meanings to the cultural heritage and accepts or incorporates these meanings to a unique degree, so that his personal cultural heritage becomes something distinctive and characteristic of himself and no other. The evolving personality, there fore, selects and adapts a personal culture out of the cultural heritage pre sented him by his parents, family, and society. And, as Spiro says, "it is not the cultural heritage of a given generation, but its culture, that becomes the cultural heritage of the succeeding generation."34 The value-system of each individual personality is something unique and distinctive of that</page><page sequence="13">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 89 individual. But the unique quality of its integration does not violate its capacity for shared meaning or the familial or communal aspects of its sym bolic integration. Herein lies the solution of the unique sharing of the in dividual in the communal system of values which makes social life possible. The notion of cultural values In order to clarify the notion of value in this cultural context we need to establish a set of relations between the ideas of culture, symbol, and value. We can follow here the lines of thinking laid down by Parsons and Shils.35 Culture, taken as a whole, represents the universe of meaningful prod ucts of the symbolizing activity of a society. The elements of culture are transmissible by learning or by cultural diffusion between societies. The symbols embody the meaningful aspects of the multiple ways of orienting and acting that characterize the social system. The symbols, therefore, be come controlling elements of the system, since they are not internal to the system, but outside of it, functioning as objects of orientation that are ob jectifiable often in forms of graphic or plastic representation. By reason of this symbolic aspect, the ways of orienting in a society become learnable and transmissible. Symbols, then, are really ways of orienting embodied in and controlled by symbolic objects. The society elaborates a variety of symbol systems to express and organize the primary ways of orienting. Systems of beliefs and ideas enjoy a cognitive primacy; systems of expressive and appreciative sym bols have an emotional or cathectic primacy. Other symbol systems, how ever, have an evaluative primacy. They embody normative standards that refer to the resolution of conflicts, solving of problems, and the organiza tion and direction of action (goal-related). These standards or values are of a different order of symbol from primarily cognitive or expressive sym bols. They represent a synthesis of cognitive and affective-cathectic ele ments through which the acting individual is committed to action in terms</page><page sequence="14">90 Journal of Religion and Health of a balance of consequences and implications in conformity with the im peratives of a larger social (interactional) system of normative orientation. The value-standards... are not logical deductions from systems of beliefs or manifestations of systems of expressive symbols, nor do they derive from cognitive or appreciative standards. They depend in part on such systems, but they draw on all the elements of cogni tive, cathectic, and evaluative selection from the alternatives of action. The impor tant alternatives (which define the problems of action) emerge for the actor only when he, armed with his cognitive and cathectic symbols and standards directly confronts the relevant situation with all its functional exigencies. As he develops general methods for making choices among these alternatives, he thereby gains a new set of super-ordinate standards. These are moral value standards.36 Values, therefore, are symbols of normative orientation. They serve an or ganizing and integrating function both at the level of personal action and at the level of community action. They are the means by which the individ ual's choices among the alternatives of action are integrated, within the limits of variability, with the symbolic orientations of the society. Insofar as the integration is successful, the conditions for social interaction and the integrity of the social system are maintained and the individual func tions in a socialized or encultured manner. The value-system is a significant symbolic system and a vital aspect of culture. It shares the ambiguities of conceptualization and definition which are inherent in the concept of culture. We have already discussed this as pect of the problem above. We need only note that whatever the approach to value, whether it is conceived as purely conceptual and abstract or whether it be regarded as consisting in actual preferences and actions, the concept of value carries with it the implication of worth and worthwhile ness. They have an intrinsically normative reference. This normative as pect of the value-system eliminates merely preferential behavior from the value-perspective,37 although it seems perfectly legitimate for the study of cultural values to start with preferential behavior, since much of it is value dependent. Thus, current usage is generally agreed that values involve ref</page><page sequence="15">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 91 erence to normative standards of action, and further, that they are intrinsi cally goal-oriented. Belshaw concludes: One cannot conceive of a value without an expression of the goal envisaged. Thus a moral precept, for example, is important because it expresses a goal; if it did not relate to behavior in this way, it would have no significance as a value. Thus a sig nificant element in the anthropological treatment of value so far is that it pur ports to elucidate goals.38 The value-system, therefore, is both normative and directive, and thereby, we might add, organizing and integrating. Some of the implications of the cultural concept of value have been well displayed by Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck in terms of value-orientations. They define value-orientations (cultural values) as "complex but definitely patterned (rank-ordered) principles, resulting from the transactional in terplay of three analytically distinguishable elements of the evaluative pro cess?the cognitive, the affective, and the directive elements?which give order and direction to the ever-flowing stream of human acts and thoughts as these related to the solution of 'common human' problems."39 What emerges here is the normative and directive character of the value-system, which underlines the basically selective nature of the value process. Direc tiveness is a fundamental biologically derived property in that the orga nism has selective dispositions to react differentially to heterogeneous aspects of the stimulus field. Insofar as human behavior is instinctively based, it is thereby inherently directed; insofar as it is not instinct-bound, the range of directive influences is expanded. As Hartmann has pointed out, the functions served by instinct in lower animals are served by more complex forms of integration at the human level.40 Thus cognitive and cathectic elements are causes of behavior, but they are incapable of achieving the guiding and integrating function that is in herent in the directive aspects of the value-system. The value-system does, in fact, derive the content of its existential and normative assumptions from cognitive and affective elements. If it were not for the level of human</page><page sequence="16">92 Journal of Religion and Health capacity for intellection and affection, the value-system by which man tran scends the instinctual could not exist. But it is at the same time apparent that, while the value-system transcends the instinctual, it is dependent on and derivative from that which it transcends. As Kluckhohn and Strodt beck observe: Any given value system of human beings has both a content and a direction which derive from biologically given capacities and predispositions but are not instinct bound, but it is the directive aspect which is the most crucial for the understand ing of both the integration of the total value-system and its continuity through time.41 Variations and variability in values As we have observed, the objective reality of values is that of its existence as intrapsychic structure resident within individual personalities. It is the symbolic dimension of shared meanings that makes it possible to abstract a more or less common normative orientation in the social system and refer to it as the value-system of that social group. This abstractive procedure, along with its concomitant reification of the resulting construct, often leads us to ignore the range of variation in the actual valuings on which the cul tural value-system is based. The culture is thought of as having a dominant set of values and the range of variant values at large in the members of the society is lost sight of. As soon as we direct attention away from the abstraction toward actual social groupings, variation becomes apparent. Variant subgroups in the cul ture have a diversity of values, so that the culture itself can be conceived in terms of a more or less dominant value-orientation that is continually in interaction with constituent and variant value-orientations. Each society can therefore be characterized by a pattern of value variation which can be conceived as systematic and ordered. Moreover, the existence of variant values need not be seen only as deviations from a dominant cultural ethos. They may also serve a primary function in the maintenance of the system. Thus, Hyman has demonstrated a different set of values in regard to education</page><page sequence="17">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 93 and socioeconomic advancement among low classes from those in mid dle and upper classes.42 Here is a clear case of divergent subcultural values; but how is this divergence to be regarded? One can regard lower class val ues as deviant and therefore as creating strain in the social system. Or one may regard them as part of a pattern of systematic variation in which the variation in lower class values serves a function in stabilizing and maintain ing the whole system. No value-system can be completely consistent. There are inevitably dif ficulties in fitting the value-system to the demands of the real society or per sonality. When the value-system is inconsistent or the articulation of the so cial system with the value-system is forced, strain is produced. The diversity of forces and functional needs of any action system is simply beyond the ca pacity of any internally consistent value-system. The result is felt in terms of strain. The society responds by adopting various adaptive mechanisms calculated to reduce the strain and achieve some degree of functional in tegration. There is evolved a compromise between "functional impera tives"43 of the concrete situation and the dominant value patterns of the society. The society may establish a priority ranking among the dominant values, so that a gradation in tolerance for deviant values and deviant action is established. The degree of tolerance will be smaller in authoritarian or ganizations as a rule, since they will tend to seek as broad a pattern of con formity to the predominant value-system as is possible. The society may al locate divergent values to special contexts and roles, thereby isolating the bearers of divergent values and limiting disintegrative effects on the pre dominant system. This both confines the repercussions of deviance and per mits the continued operation of the total system. Thus the deviation from normal can be defined or categorized as pathological and thereby isolated, or it may be accepted as normal and ascribed to a special role in the society. The Siberian shaman, for example, seems to represent a class of privileged status that achieves that status by passing through a stage of frank psycho sis.44 The class of shamans is respected, honored, and severely cir cumscribed, and thereby successfully integrated into the over-all system.</page><page sequence="18">94 Journal of Religion and Health Whether such examples are more accurately regarded as deviation or whether they are expressions of the range of permissible variation is a moot question. The alternatives are relevant to the understanding of values, since behind them lies the question whether the value is to be conceived of in terms of an ideal norm that behavior approaches in varying degrees so that one's behavior either conforms or deviates (black-and-white), or whether the value in fact represents a range of permissible behaviors. An interesting example is Stouffer's study of role conflict.45 On the assump tion that in any authoritarian situation, conformity will depend on the. compatibility between ruler and the dominant values of those who must obey, Stouffer found that the range of approved acts for authorities and stu dents showed almost complete identity in some students, no overlap in others, and differing ranges with some degree of overlap in still others. He concluded that the range of approved or permissible behavior as perceived by a given individual is important for the analysis of what constitutes the social norm. In essay writing in this field it is common and convenient to think of a social norm as a point, or at least as a very narrow band on either side of a point. This probably is quite unrealistic as to most of our social behavior. And it may be precisely the ranges of permissible behavior which most need examination, if we are to make progress in this realm which is so central in social science. For it may be the very existence of some flexibility or social slippage?but not too much?which makes behavior in groups possible.46 It should be pointed out, in addition, that what is relevant to the cultural value-system in terms of conformity and deviation, in terms of value-con flict and strain, and in terms of value variation and the conception of values as representing ranges of permissible behavior, these are also relevant to the personal value-system. The individual accepts and incorporates a shared system of values only to a unique degree. His participation in the values of the culture is conditioned by his own inner valuing processes, which are a function of his own personality and its unique constellation of determining influences. His own personal values are unique and distinctive</page><page sequence="19">Notes Toward a Theory of Values 95 and may demonstrate any degree of "deviation" from the cultural pattern. The result is conflict and strain, which call forth adaptive and integrative mechanisms. Each individual creates a new pattern of values that is not found in any cultural pattern. The range of permissible variability that cul tural mechanisms can tolerate establishes an inner perimeter beyond which individual variability must be felt as deviant. Cultural mechanisms are in operation to lessen the degree of social strain and preserve the integrity of the social system. Personal mechanisms are also put into operation to mini mize intrapsychic conflict and preserve the integrality of the personality. Here, too, we need not think of such mechanisms as being required except beyond a certain range of personally permissible and acceptable behaviors. Values as integrative The direction of this study has been conceptual and exploratory. What has emerged from our consideration is the fact that values are a form of sym bolic activity that requires the emergence of self-objectivation and identifi cation and the capacity for participating in shared meaning with others. These capacities underly the development of human personality and estab lish the possibility of culture. The organization and control of social living in groups depend on man's capacity to form in himself by selection, adaptation, and other formative processes a set of directive and normative principles that constitute stan dards for his participation in the community. The principles are formed by symbolic processes, based on the integration of instinctual needs, capacities, constitutional givens, defenses, sublimations, repressions, and roles, and as similate in varying degrees the normative orientation of surrounding value standards that define the limits of acceptable variation. Values are thus in tegrative forces within the social structure that organize, direct, and control the lines of individual action. Values, as thus conceived, are a more or less permanent symbolic struc ture within the intrapsychic economy. Their functions are involved at the</page><page sequence="20">96 Journal of Religion and Health level of symbolic expression and require the capacity for abstraction, intel lection, and the communication, transmission, and sharing of meaning. The value-system must, therefore, be considered as an ego-structure. It is, moreover, normative and directive, serving the function of integration of meaningful activity in both the psychic and social economies. We can sug gest, in the light of all that has gone before, that the concept of value is not only consistent, but also congruent, with the more or less heuristic notion previously elaborated on psychological grounds.47 They are both, in fact, dealing with the same objective reality. What we have added in this present consideration is the cultural aspect, i.e., that values are also symbolic sys tems capable of shared meaning and abstraction. References 1. Meissner, S.J., W.
