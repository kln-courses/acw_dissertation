London—New York, I, II, 162 and 184 pp., 1982. The two-volume proceedings comprise the editorially amended papers pre sented at a conference of philosophical ly oriented biologists and philosophers dealing with biological questions. The conference took place in Bressanon near Padua (26—30th March, 1980) and discussed objections to the currently prevalent paradigm of the so-called syn thetic theory of Neo-Darwinism. The authors are united in opposing "hard nose reductionism and dogmatic mate rialism" which appear in most official works, particularly in the spheres of psychology and the physiology of the nervous system, identified with each other. They seek a way out into "non reductionism", i.e. dialectical materia lism with the help of which they could construct their arguments and marshal their observations. However, they are far from seeing its starting point in "the discredited tradition of "diamat" in the Soviet Union". But they can rely just as little, of course, on the "hegemonic strength of the reductionist tradition of Western philosophy or epistemology in which they grew up." They are therefo re aware of and set as their goal to begin almost at the beginning in expe riments to understand the dialectics of biology and society in the formation of human consciousness. With this aim, ex perts in philosophy, sociology, mathe matics, linguistics, psychoanalysis, psychology, ethology, pharmacology, neurobiology and developmental and evolutionary biology met at the Bressan son conference in order to take up a stance on this question. Every beginning is difficult, and so the above attempt to relinquish all tra ditions, such as antithetic approach to the classical writers of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, who have always thoroughly evaluated the whole legacy of thought available, shows in more than one di rection that instead of qualitatively su perseding their predecessors they too often repeated their errors. In spite of this fact their efforts do not lack new and fresh thoughts, which are like a cool breeze blowing through the stable air of official neo-Darwinism. It is the refore worth of taking a serious look at the proceedings. The first volume is called "Towards a Liberatory Biology" (162 pp.) and is made up of ten lectures on individual questions only loosely connected. The introductory paper, by Steven Rose, the general editor of the proceed ings, is called "From Causations to Translations: A Dialectical Solution to a Reductionist Enigma". As can be seen from the titles of individual paragraphs: Man and Brain, On Levels of Analy sis, The Subjects/Objects of Study, The Inadequacy of System Approaches. The Hazards of Rectification, The Reductio nist Fallacy, Springing the Trap, From Causes to Translations, it is an unbrind led critisism of bourgeois philosophical views on the question of human cons ciousness. But the author does not take a stance, as one might suppose, against cognition of causes or even an acausa listic position, but tries to show that where relations at various levels descri bed by various branches of science are involved, the term "cause" is often in correctly ' used to designate various aspects of the same phenomenon of va rious structural levels. If we say e.g. that "if a chicken leams an aversion to a certain taste, it is a cause of increased protein synthesis in a certain part of its cerebrum, if we prevent protein synthesis in the brain this causes a me mory failure", these are not causes but various expresions of the same pheno menon on various levels. The author therefore emphasizes the necessity of "translating" findings on various struc tural levels instead of seeking problema tic "interlevel causes", which gives us, according to the author, a better key to understanding the world than reduc tionism. And understanding the world, as he rightly points out, is the first step towards changing it. One can agree with Rose's conclusions as regards the impor tance of mediating between findings ol various scientific branches dealing with different levels of the same phenomena. It must be borne in mind thai con demning reductionism as an incorrect and harmful method of interpretation does not mean that one denies or de creases the significance of the reduc tion method in obtaining information on lower levels of the phenomena stu died (cf. Fedosyeev 1983). The author of part two "Negotiating Boundaries: Psychology, biology, socie ty" (pgs. 26—39), Chris Sinha, in his introduction "The Matter of Mind" for mulates the central problem of current understanding of the question: the mu tual relations between biology and cul ture, genes and the social environment. He emphasizes the reductionist attitude of behaviourism, which has altogether rejected the idea of "the mind" as an epiphenomenon that cannot be studied by scientific methods. Of course, accord ing to the author "cognitive psycholo gy" regarding "the mind" as an object of scientific research, basically main tains the reductionist attitude, since it pictures the mind as an artificially con structed universum made up of blocks and geometric shapes flat pictures and abstract syllogisms (like the program of a computer). Logico-cybernetic mo dels of the mind set up by the current cognitive psychology Sinha calls "ma chinomorphism". The author analyses the mutual re lations between psychology, biology and society from the viewpoint of Rose's "translation", though Sinha thinks that it is not the best way of superseding reductionism. He sees the means of doing so in the idea of "representation", which is widely used by cognitive psy chologists, but he gives it his own rather different interpretation. Sinha claims that the idea of "representation" is quite new, different from the concept of reflection (in the sense of Lenin's theory), but this does not seem to be true. The brain may be considered not only as a "machine" carrying on "re presentation", but is also a "representa tion" (basically a reflection) of its own environment and a complex of functio nal adaptations of an- organism (which is behaviour). Of course, the concept of "representation" of the author is not completely clarified and even if the idea of reflection has been substituted nothing would change. The author em phasizes the "material" character of the representation, and sees it in "the dia lectics of support and constraint". For example, the brain is the basis, support for the possibility of using a natural language but at the same time the spe cific characters of its physiology, bio chemistry, etc., set certain limits. The author stresses the systemic cha racter of representation language as a system of representation in fact being interconnected, and here the author sees a possibility of interconnecting the scientific sludy of phenomena important for the understanding of consciousness, without any reductionism. In order to overcome the crisis in psychology the problem of the relations between biology and society must be resolved. Man's consciousness cannot be understood as his biology (biological individuality), it must be understood as a complex of socially discursive practi ces materially reflected as specific sub jective phenomena which have an indi vidual character. According to the author biological individuality is not the source of consciousness, but one of its bases, and the source of consciousness must be 93 TOWARDS A LIBERATORY BIOLO GY (The Dialectics of Biology Group) General Editor Steven Rose, Allison and Basby.

The paper by Patrick Bateson „Syn thesizing Views about the Origins of Behaviour" is valuable and stimulating, showing on the one hand that it is not possible to draw absolute conclusions on the genetic conditioning of animal be haviour, and on the other showing the limits of adaptability, and emphasizing the significance of dialectical materia lism for resolving these questions. He considers from this point of view the question of sensitive periods in the de velopment of the young of various ani mals, and reaches the important con clusion that with the passing of such periods the animal does not lose the ability to learn further but only the willingness to do so. This is of basic importance from the point of view of its practical use where it is needed. Part four (On the Teleonomic Study of Maternal Behaviour, pp. 50—61), written by Bruno D'Udine and Enrico Alleva, mainly concerned with the problem of methodological evaluation of the study of the behaviour of animals under experimental conditions in the wild and with the necessity of super seding reductionism in this sphere, which according to the authors consists in a complex approach. The authors show that the categories used in experimental research into ani mal behaviour are an expression of a certain concept which affects planning and carrying out of the experiments. In the study of behaviour this most often means anthropomorphic terms which must gradually, with the accumulation of knowledge, be replaced by new, more precise ones. For instance, the idea of "maternal behaviour" is being replaced gradually by the idea of "pa rental investition". The authors are of the view that it is not correct to derive complications of behaviour from com plications of the CNS, particularly as far as individual forms of behaviour, such as for example parental behaviour, are concerned. The chief reason is that be haviour is adapted to environment and this affects behaviour and its forms to a great extent. The authors rightly indicate the dif ficulty of classification in biology, be ginning with taxonomy and particularly in the case of behaviour. Using the example of precocial/altricial distinction according to the trait of the necessity to care for young, they state that this distinction artificially breaks the conti nuity of the development of behaviour and does not take account of the major influence of the environment. Of course, the arguments are not sufficiently con vincing as far as the concrete example is concerned: according to the authors the experimental study of behaviour is very useful and fruitful but must be planned with a view to knowledge of behaviour in the wild and to the spe cific features of the natural environ ment, which may be quite an effective protection against reductionism. The authors consider it necessary to take greater care as regards categories previously used, and in particular to pay attention to the development of methodology. B. Hubbard's paper indicates the problems of present-day genetics and the reductionist character of its evolutionary conclusions in particular. She points particularly to the elements of heredi tarianism and individualism which occur in the conclusions of current genetics more or less independent of experimen tal results and which have their origins in the social-Darwinist ideas of Spen cer and many eugenists, based on the works of Galton, Mendel, Muller (1913) and many others. Hubbard tries to show the lack of justification for ex panding the idea of genes as condition ing the occurrence of certain qualities, while Mendel's original work speaks of factors connected with changes and dif ferences. In agreement with the group of French authors who published the book "Les Manipulations Génétiques" under the pseudonym Agatha Mendel, and which she had the opportunity to read only afterwards, the authoress expres ses the view that genes or the appro priate parts of the DNA molecule are only a small component in the process of the origin of the diversity of living organisms, and their formation through out their ontogenetical development. They are in fact a result of the dialec tical relation between the formation of the same qualities and the formation of differences. She expresses many other objections to genetical reductionism and calls to mind the joke of Agatha Men del, where the attempts of present mo lecular biologists and biologists can be compared with a childish idea that we shall get know how a television works through a chemical analysis of the on/ /off switch. She also expresses her con viction that "the biocratic dream cannot be realized by manipulating the genes" (genetic engineering), which is based on an incorrect view of the functions of genes exaggerating their control of me tabolism and development. She conclu des that in agriculture sincp the appea rance of formal genetics geneticists have probably learned more from growers and breeders than vice versa. The short contribution of the mole cular biologist Claudio Scazzocchia "Re flections on the Limits of Biological Re ductionism" is the view of a worker in "the most reductionist of the biological sciences", molecular genetics, on the problem of reductionism in biology. The author in his introduction correctly if rather extremely expresses his stance, on the one hand on reductionism, which he calls "at best illegitimate and naive", on the other hand he establishes that to throw overboard all reductionism and neo-Darwinism and with it the concept of the unity of science, along with the worst excesses of ethologists and socio biologists, is "obscurant and intrinsically reactionary". In the text itself it beco mes clear that his indignation is, as is often the case in such matters, based more on a misunderstanding of the matter. So in the very first paragraph, called "All materialism is reductionism", introduced by the sentence "It is impos sible to conceive a materialistic view of the world that is not in one sense reductionist", the author shows that he does not distinguish between reductio nism as an incorrect view of all quali ties and the method of reduction as an attempt to explain them in terms of lower qualities and the correct and necessary research and respecting of all structural levels of matter. His absolu tization of the differences between phe nomena where a synchronnous approach is possible, i.e. without respect to the development or historical factors, and phenomena where such an approach is not possible is also incorrect, though there are certainly cases where the syn chronnous approach is easier and those where it is unlounched by present-day science, but it is bassically possible and desirable in all cases, just as the evolu tionary approach is necessary for a dee per understanding of the origin and substance of all phenomena. This in correct approach is still more striking in the question of human consciousness. Thus in effect the whole basis of the paper is its convincing of the reader and the author of what should have been clear before he set pen to paper. However, let it be said that most of the other contributions stimulate such a mi sunderstanding. There are in the pro ceedings many superficial, incorrect or actually harmful statements, for example a failure to distinguish between the term, "selfish DNA" of Qrgel and Crick (1980), i.e. genetically inactive segments of the DNA molecule, and between what is quite incorrectly called a "selfish gene" (Dawkins 1976) and which is the very opposit; the unilateral final state ments that extrapolations of sociobiolo gists are either incorrect or so general as to be trivial. Actually harmfull and unprogressive is the statement that the explanation of the function of the struc ture of any organism or its part, from the virus through organelles, cells and organs, is in concord with any theory of development and with the creatio nism of the most extreme fundamenta lists — here we are on the treshold of a mere lack of understanding. One of the most significant pa pers in the proceedings is that of Mae-Wan-Ho and P. T. Saunders: "Adaptation and Natural Selection: Me chanism and Teleology" which shows the basis and justification of the present criticism of neo-Darwinism and its shortcomings. Above all the authors correctly show the failings and overall incorrectness of neo-Darwinism, both in the context of natural selection and on questions of genetics, antievolutionary absolutization of the "central dogm", etc., and show the culmination of this concept ad absurdum in the ideas of Dawkins, who sees in evolution mere competition for reproduction between individual genes. They set against neo Darwinism the data and conclusions of epigenetics in the works of Waddington and the data on the so-called permanent modifications (Jollos 1921, Martin 1957, inter alia) and consider the question of heredity of acquired characters and ge netical assimilation from the point ol so-called Lamarckism and Lamarck's contribution to the question. They very 94</page><page sequence="3">rightly emphasize that to connect the idea of 'Lamarckism' with the genctical question of the direct effect of the envi ronment on genes in the direction of adaptation is as most biologists under stand it today, ahistorical. Lamarck did not and could not speak of genetics or natural selection because they were unknown at the time. In a supplement the authors consider the question of so ciology and correctly show the connec tion between its main shortcomings and neo-Darwinism. What has been said of the positive contribution of Ho and Saunders does not mean that it is without shortcom ings. Some of them, however, show still more convincingly the untenability of neo-Darwinism. Their conclusions on natural selection the actual definition of the basic assumptions which they give (hereditary variability (I), Malthu sian growth of population (II) and the limitation of resources (food, etc) (III), show that the authors, apparently with out being aware of it, do not enter into polemics with the real Darwinistic concept of natural selection, but with its neo-Darwinistic deformation. It is in this confusion of natural selection with the intraspecific struggle which clearly follows from point III, limited resour ces, and the following mention of com petition for survival and reproduction and the survival of the fittest, that the most serious shortcoming of neo-Darwi nism lies. This approach is, however, still generally widespread in biology, particularly in the West. In my opinion there is certain misun derstanding in the rejection of gradua lism by the authors, which in its very substance is a Darwinist idea, and does not give rise to the negative consequen ces Ho and Saunders attribute to it. Above all, the extent of one-off changes giving rise to variability of genetic ma terial must objectively be limited by the fact that more extensive mutations all lead to disturbances in the internal coordination of organisms and are, the refore, mostly pathogenic, and in addi tion are all recessive. On the other hand, saltationism as it is conceived e.g. by Gould and Eldridge (1971), or that which" is justified in it, cannot be in contradiction to gradualism. It follows from the law of quantity changing to quality that the arising of a new quali ty not only does not eliminate but actually presupposes continuity on the quantitative level. The substance of the matter is in the dialectics of chance and necessity, which the proponents of neo Darwinism are apparently unable to understand: the fact that the variability of hereditary deviations is random as far as its significance for the survival of the given individuals is concerned does not mean that they have to be random and thus unorganized and inde pendent of the environment, as the neo-Darwinists assume. On the other hand the importance of the environ ment in evolution does not eliminate the decisive and exclusive part played by natural selection in the appearance of purposeful adaptation. However, one of changes, i.e. advantageous deviations, cannot be considered adaptations, but only a purposeful accumulation of them through natural selection. As Darwin showed, one can thus explain even the best adapted organs such as the eagle's eye or man's hands and brain. The above reservations in no way detract from the significance and topica lity of the contribution of these two authors and their pointing out of such important new problems. This unfortu nately can not be said of the next two contributions, whose line of attack is directed more towards Darwinism than neo-Darwinism, and thus towards evo lutionism generally, and they call for support on such "authorities" as Cuvier and Driesch, without taking into account its enormous positive contribution. So far Webster and Goodwin in the paper "History and Structures in Biolo gy" the alternative to the "evolutionary paradigm" is a structuralist conception of the organism, which "can be develo ped from seeds in the tradition of Cu vierian rational morphology" (pp. 103 to 106). It is indicative of their ap proach that in the ease of Cuvier and Driesch, whom they frequently quote, they see nothing but good, and not a word is said of the anti-evolutionary stance of the first, his theory of cata strophes, his calculating catholicism and thoughtless attack on his older colleague from the Parisian Museé Nationale, J. B. Lamarck, at a time when the latter could not defend himself because of illness (cf. Burkhard 1978) or of the idealism and vitalism of the second, while in the case of Darwin, whose work has become the starting point and main pillar of the scientific world outlook and whose relevant scientific views have a basic scientific importance for the question under discussion, he is not quoted at all, and on the contrary they throw doubt upon him by various neO Darwmist deformations, and speak only of "the empiricist and utilitarian con cepts of Protestant natural theology" (a truly peculiar evaluation of scientific work, which with the "holistic concept of the German tradition" gave birth to the "evolutionary paradigm"). In other place they speak of Darwin's "empiris tic-positivistic perspectives" (pg. 109), etc. At the same time they put into opposition without justification the structuralistically understood "laws of form" and the concept of selection and evolution in general. Though they are in the end forced by the logic of the matter assert that their remarks are not intended to overthrow "Darwin's functionalist interpretation" (a strange way to describe the concept of natural selection) or "the historical theory of origin" (i.e..the evolutionary concept), and that the structuralistic standpoint is in agreement with them (it seems to be inconsistent with all they have said to discredit it), they do in fact in the end emphasize that it is independent of them. By this partial conception to reality they do not, howe ver, set the rights or even seem to want to set to rights the confusion they have introduced into the mind of biologically less informed readers. The question re mains how does this article correspond to the professional and philosophical orientation and goals of the proceed ings ? Jonathan Cook in his article "Neo Darwinism and Evolutionary Biology" seems to take the same philosophical and political view as Webster and Goodwin, frequently referring to their paper. This is seen right at the beginning, where he speaks of "a tragic example of the over zealous application of the Marxist prin ciple that even the basic theory in a science is subject during its develop ment to. the balance of ideological for ces." Unlike the authors of the previous article he as an active biologist brings to bear a number of positive findings and observations from his own field (embryology). But even here we find examples of misunderstanding the dia lectics of questions, e.g. the occurrence of structures which have adaptive signi ficance in a given species or group in development stages of other groups where they have no significance at all, which is the basis of the Darwin-Haec kel law of recapitulation. The conclu sion of the article, in favour of the synthetic approach, is more acceptable. If we speak of Charles Darwin, it is said and at the same time symptomatic, how little understanding he, one of the greatest natural scientists of all times and a leading spontaneous dialectician and materialist, has found among his own countrymen, even those who con sider this school of philosophy to be supreme. As fa- as the path to a "libe ratory biology" is concerned, which was tackled in the introduction, it can be said that even though each grain of truth even in the greatest of opponents is worthwhile for this purpose, we do not find any in the preevolutionary views put forward by both the last two papers. The tenth part, "Towards a Theory of Human Systems" (pgs. 134—150), is written by the husband-and-wife team of Stephen and Beatrice Chorover, he being a neuropsychologist and she an expert in the field of family therapy. Their individual experience in their own fields and personal contact stimulated the exploration of a conceptual basis for a synthesis of biological, psychological and social systems (human brain, per sonality and social groups). In an attempt to formulate this conceptual basis the authors met not only termino logical problems but also facts which show the problem presented by the in creasing specialization of experts, de termining their mutual isolation and being reflected in the predominance of epistemologie reductionism and mecha nistic determinism. In the authors' opi nion mechanistic determinism, like epistemological reductionism, is unable to explain the facts revealed by scienti fic knowledge in the course of the 20th century on the system of man, and here they are right. The continuing existence of this approach is explained by the authors through the effect of feedback existing in the society between the production of "meanings" by science and the existence of a "power" in so ciety, for present-day capitalism as a hierarchically organized society en 95</page><page sequence="4">courages certain ideas and schools of thought. In the history of psychology "menta lism" (James) considered the subject of psychological study to be the "mental life" of man, made up of two parts — cognition and feelings. Behaviourism rejected these aspects as epiphenomena studying instead "acting"; the problem can be approached experimentally, it can be measured, etc. The authors think that it is time to progress from the antithesis to the synthesis and to ana lyse the three elements or aspects of the human system — cognition, feeling and acting, in terms of human existence thinking, feeling and doing. All three interact dialectically in the development process and are affected by the environ ment. The authors suggest a diagram of the three aspects of the "human system" on three levels of organization: the bio logical level — human brain (similarly neocortex, limbic system and "core", or the reptilian brain according to Mac Lean), the psychological level — per sonality (and similarly, thinking, feel ing and doing), on the social level — social group (and similarly-fact, values and social practice). The basic shortcoming of their ap proach is the incorrect evaluation of the process of human activity, for acting (doing) would basically only mean "moving". Activity is an integrative component where the cognitive, emotio nal and motor elements of behaviour are in close connection and, other things aside, this activity only has a meaning in a social context. However, the authors' efforts are laudable and their solution certainly contains a great number of positive fea tures. V. J. A. Novák, V. V. Leonovičová ca. V. J. A. Novák, V. V.
