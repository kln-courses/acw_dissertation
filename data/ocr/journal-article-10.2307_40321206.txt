Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2006. 741 pp. In the last fifteen years or so, a significant number of collections of prag- matist writings and anthologies of "American thought" have appeared. Whether it is merely a temporary surge of interest or an indicator of a more permanent trend remains to be seen. The fact is, however, that at this time the market offers competing visions of what constitutes the core corpus of pragmatist philosophy; for in a contested tradition of thought, such as pragmatism, the selection of texts is rarely a matter of just picking out the finest exemplars. It is a process of construction or reconstruction, which may prove to be both consequential and controversial. This collection, compiled by Susan Haack and Robert Lane, is one of the most recent attempts to put together a representative volume that would cover the main strands of pragmatism, old and new alike. It includes selections from the usual suspects - Charles Peirce, William James, John Dewey, Richard Rorty - but thankfully also writings by some less obvious names, such as Frank Ramsey and Sidney Hook. However, Pragmatism, Old &amp; New does not only provide a couple of minor surprises in the authors included; it also offers some unexpected picks from key figures. Overall, the picture presented is one of a living debate between various factions, an impression strengthened by the inclusion of an entertaining "conversation" between Peirce and Rorty. This highlighting of discrepancies in pragmatism can possibly be ques- tioned, but it does provide the collection with a backbone and ration- ale that helps to set it apart from the competition. In particular, the volume under scrutiny provides a welcome alter- native to the comparable reader assembled by Louis Menand,1 an anthology marked by its rather idiosyncratic view of the tradition and its clear preference for the more radical variants of neopragmatism. Indeed, one of the motivations behind Haack's and Lane's collection is undoubtedly the need to counter Menand's distorted story; Haack has dubbed Menand's take on pragmatism "Vulgar Rortyism",2 a further step toward the abyss from the plain old "vulgar pragmatism" of Rorty.

PEIRCE SOCIETY Vol. 43, No. 3 ©2007 575</page><page sequence="2">CO m h-H &gt; 576 The quantitative distribution of texts in Pragmatism, Old &amp; New also reveals something about the editors' perception of pragmatist thought, and possibly also about their personal preferences. The classi- cal pragmatists (by whom I mean Peirce, James, Dewey, George H. Mead, and ECS. Schiller) take up about two thirds of the book. There are nine selections from Peirce, five from James, and seven from Dewey; the rest of the authors are confined to one or two contributions each (unless we count the compiled "discussion" between Peirce and Rorty, which would bring their shares to ten and three, respectively). The emphasis is on the core philosophical issues of truth, knowledge, and meaning, although metaphysical, moral, and social topics are also rep- resented, mainly through texts by James and Dewey. Again, this focus brings a welcome degree of continuity to the collection, but also tends to give it a slight slant toward problems of epistemology and realism. Nonetheless, the collection offers a good overview of the major play- ers in the drama of pragmatism: in addition to the authors already men- tioned, there are pieces by Clarence Irving Lewis, Morton White, Willard Van Orman Quine, Nelson Goodman, and Hilary Putnam. There are also omissions, of course. This is unavoidable in a volume that attempts to present the weighty ideas of several seminal minds in a limited number of pages, and cannot be seen as a major fault. Still, it would have been refreshing to see at least one excerpt from the Italian pragmatists of the early 1900s, who admittedly were not as original or significant as Peirce, James, and Dewey, but who nonetheless played an important supporting role in the intellectual history of the early prag- matist tradition. Some inclusions could be questioned as well; Quine is undeniably a seminal American philosopher, and can be seen as an heir to Deweys naturalistic project, but on the whole his pragmatist cre- dentials are debatable. These are petty gripes, however. Somewhat more serious doubts could be raised concerning some of the individual selections. Perhaps surprisingly, my biggest qualms concern the choice of texts from Peirce, who, it is probably fair to say, is the key figure in the presented account of pragmatism. This is a perfectly justifiable emphasis, and for the most part, there is nothing to complain about; it is particularly gratifying to see parts of Peirce s cognition series of 1868-9 besides the mandatory essays of 1877 and 1878. However, the editors have apparently wished to exhibit Peirce s versatility and genius by the addition of writings less obviously connected to pragmatistic ideas. While the inclusion of an excerpt on the categories is still easily justifiable, one may wonder what a letter proposing the use of electricity in logical machines and a note- book entry on triadic logic really has to do with pragmatism. This is not to say that the link cannot be made, but here the editors disappointingly leave the reader to his or her own wits. I believe that the connection is far from clear for many competent Peirce scholars; it may be completely</page><page sequence="3">unfathomable for less experienced persons with a general interest in ^d pragmatist thought, who after all ought to constitute one of the pri- W mary target groups of a volume of this kind. ^ This brings us to the biggest weakness in Haacks and Lane's edition ^ of pragmatist writings; the individual selections are preceded by short ^ summaries, which in some cases are adequate, but which in others ^ (such as the ones mentioned above) do not provide sufficient context for the pieces in question. Perhaps the editors have wanted to provide people knowledgeable of pragmatism with more than just the usual fodder; it would certainly explain the quite unusual set of writings from Peirce, which, to be fair, may manage to awake the reader's curiosity as well as bewilderment. Yet, I feel that it might have been more useful to keep the focus on Peirce s explicitly pragmatist texts in this context. For instance, there is very little of his critical common-sensism, which he def- initely connected to pragmatism, in this collection. Also, it would have been rewarding to have more of Peirce s less-known pragmatist manu- scripts, many of which still await proper publication, or some of the illuminating correspondence between Peirce and the other pragmatists. These, I feel, could have complemented our picture of Peirce as a prag- matist better than his remarks on logical machines and triadic logic, interesting as they are. If the summary descriptions of the selections leave something to be desired, Susan Haack's general introduction is both instructive and thought-provoking. It succeeds in the nearly impossible task of giving a vivid overview of the tradition (and its variants) in a limited number of pages. Naturally, it is not an all-inclusive story, and could be criticized for some biases. One might aver, for instance, that Schiller is discarded a bit too abruptly, although the approach is ironically enough in line with his own biting polemical style. Haack's dismissal of Schiller as the original vulgar pragmatist is understandable, but here the emphasis on the traditional controversies of pragmatism - the mutability of truth and the making of reality - may conceal some surprising affinities. In Haacks account, Schiller is represented as more radical than James and Dewey, and hence furthest away from Peirce of the classical pragma- tists; but the picture is actually more complicated. Peirce himself often expresses a sympathy with some features of Schiller's thought, most notably with the anthropomorphic drift of the latter s humanism. While Peirce clearly deplored Schiller's bombastic and sloppy style, he appears to have spotted something akin to his own thoroughgoing rejection of the Kantian Ding an sich in Schiller's outpour. An interesting feature of Haack's introduction, which is unfortunately not fully reflected in the selections of the collection, is the identification oí two strands of neopragmatism. In addition to the usual literary culprits (i.e., Rorty and his followers), Haack mentions "the lawless rovers of the sea of science" (p. 5 1), indicating such extreme scientistic philosophers as -„</page><page sequence="4">oo Paul Churchland and Stephen Stich. Their inclusion in the pragmatist ^ tradition is at least as questionable as that of Quine; but bringing them pj into the picture would add a welcome twist to the simplistic scientific I~H pragmatism vs. literary pragmatism view, which still prevails in many ^ Peircean accounts of pragmatist thought. 7J In spite of the minor criticisms expressed in this review, Pragmatismy Oíd &amp; New is a most welcome addition to the existing collections of pragmatist writings; in fact, it fills a definite need as an antidote to some neopragmatist excesses. While some selections would have bene- fited from longer introductions, providing broader context and guid- ance, the volume is suitable for beginners as well as useful for more seasoned scholars. It is made more attractive by a set of pictures of the featured authors and the insertion of some examples of original hand- written texts. Such accompaniments may seem out of place in a philo- sophical tome, but they bring a touch of humanity to the proceedings, and accentuate the character of ongoing discussion that is one of the most appealing characteristics of the book. This collection will no doubt find a place in courses on pragmatism and American thought as well as in many private bookshelves.
