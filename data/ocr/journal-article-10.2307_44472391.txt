Digges (former Deputy Associate Administrator for Research and Development) Vernon Roberts John Morris National Highway Traffic Safety Admin. U.S. Department of Transportation Washington, DC 20590 ABSTRACT This paper examines the distribution of injuries to belted occupants involved in frontal crashes, using data from the National Accident Sampling System. Similar studies of data from Canada, Britain, and Federal Republic of Germany are summarized. The studies are consistent in showing that head and chest injuries continue to be the most harmful to belted occupants. For restrained drivers, liver injuries contribute a significant level of harm among chest/ abdominal injuries. Other significant lesions of nearly equal weight are arterial, heart, lung/ pulmonary, skeletal, and crushing injuries. Brain injuries are by far the most harmful head injury, followed by skull fracture and facial fracture. The diverse distribution of injuries, and the wide variation in occupant sizes and injury tolerances are significant considerations in optimizing restraint systems for maximum injury reduction in real crashes. Injury patterns for air bag restraints are also examined, based upon test data and field data. To date the air bags in service are performing as designed, and no patterns of serious injuries have emerged. BACKGROUND IN JULY 1984, THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PUBLISHED THE FINAL RULE ON FMVSS 208, "Occupant Protection." Since that time, significant behavioral and technological changes have occurred relative to occupant protection in passenger cars. Principal among these changes are the increase in usage rates of belt systems and the increasing availability of air bags. The 208 rule required that all passenger cars provide automatic occupant protection in frontal crashes by model year 1990. It also encouraged the introduction of air bags and the passage of safety belt use laws by the states. In recent years, protection of occupants by restraint systems has increased dramatically. The purpose of this paper is to examine the residual injuries to restrained occupants, and to seek opportunities for further injury reductions. In December 1984, New York became the first state in the United States to enact a safety belt use law. As of July 1989. 34 states and the District of Columbia had mandatory use laws in effect. Belt usage has been further encouraged by the phase- in of automatic occupant protection, principally in the form of automatic belts, beginning in model year 1987. During the period 1984 to 1988, the use rate, as measured by the 19 cities survey conducted by NHTSA, had increased from 15% to 42% (1) . Belt use was found to average 51% in the 13 cities with belt use laws, and 36% in the 6 cities without laws. It is encouraging to note that belt use rate is continuing to increase in both states with laws, and states without laws. NHTSA has estimated that from 1983 to 1988, 15,500 lives were saved by the use of safety belts (2) • Air bags are also being introduced in increasing numbers. During the early 70' s air bag equipped passenger cars were produced in limited numbers (less than 12,000) by General Motors. Ford and Volvo introduced test fleets of less than 1000 vehicles during the same period. In October of 1984. Mercedes-Benz became the first manufacturer to offer driver air bags in the United States as standard equipment. Their design included three point manual belts for all outboard occupants and featured a pretensioning device in the shoulder belt retractor for the right front passenger. Their supplemental restraints were standard on the 5 00 SEL, and 500SEC. and optional on the 3 80 SE, 380SL and 190 models. Ford began offering optional air bags on the Tempo/Topaz ★Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. 1458</page><page sequence="2">during model year (MY) 1985. In MY 1986. BMW introduced a driver air bag equipped L7 model, and Mercedes-Benz added driver air bags and driver and right front passenger belt pretensioning devices as standard equipment on all car lines. In MY 1987, Porsche became the first manufacturer of the 80' s to offer both driver and right front passenger air bags. Honda/ Acura and Volvo also began offering air bags in MY 1987 as standard equipment on several models. Chrysler introduced air bags as standard equipment on several models in MY 1988. These models included the Plymouth Gran Fury, the Dodge Day tona and Diplomat, the Chrysler LeBaron coupe and convertible. By MY 1989 Chrysler became the world's largest producer of air bag equipped cars. During the last two model years, air bags have also been offered by Audi, GM, Nissan, and Saab. The total number of air bag equipped vehicles produced or sold in the United States by all manufacturers was approximately 436,000 through MY 1988. It is expected to exceed 1 million by the end of 1989 (3) • As the number of occupants protected by restraint systems increases, the overall injury risk decreases. Designers of vehicle crash safety systems seek to improve crash protection to further reduce the risk of injuries to occupants. An examination of the field accident data provides insight into opportunities for progress in injury reduction. The sections to follow present data on the way occupants are injured. Of principal interest are the residual injuries incurred by restrained occupants, and how these injuries are distributed by body region. ACCIDENT DATA ANALYSIS Figures 1A and IB show the distribution of passenger car occupant fatalities and harm by crash direction. Both restrained and unrestrained occupants are included in Figure 1. The fatalities are based upon the 1987 census of United States fatal accidents, as recorded in the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) . The "harm" distribution is based upon the 1979-1986 National Accident Sampling System (NASS) files. Harm is a quantification of the consequence of all injury, accounting for both frequency and severity. The concept was developed by Malliaris (4) • It may be noted from Figure 1 that the frontal crash direction continues to be the largest source of occupant fatalities and harm, accounting for more than 45 percent of both populations. The total occupant protection system design should, of course, address all crash modes. However, the principal testing and regulatory emphasis for restraint systems has been directed to the frontal crash mode.

To reduce confounding influences» injuries which may have resulted from vehicle rollover or occupant ejection are excluded. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of serious injuries and harm by body region for restrained passenger car occupants in frontal crashes. The harm data are for all injuries reported in the 1982 through 1986 NASS file. The AIS 3+ category includes only those injuries in the 82-86 file with a severity of three or greater. Generally» the injury counts are weighted by a national expansion factor which is used to make the NASS files representative of the population of accidents which occur in the United States. In this analysis» the unweighted values of AIS 3+ injuries and "harm" are used. The "N" values are shown in the legend of the figure. The harm unweighted *Nn values refer to the count of all injuries AIS 1 and above. All accidents except those involving rollover and ejections are included. In the NASS file» up to six individual injuries for each injured occupant may be coded into the computerized file» and it is all these injuries that are included in this analysis. This approach is considered appropriate for providing guidance on improvement opportunities. Other characterizations, such as the maximum injury received by each occupant are considered less useful for this purpose. The number of belt restrained occupants who received serious injuries is still quite small. Cases involving air bag equipped vehicles are virtually nil in the current NASS file. It may be observed in Figure 2 that the head/ face and chest account for the about half of the serious injuries and harm. A more refined analysis of the NASS data permits further examination of the nature of chest/ abdominal and head/face injuries in frontal impacts. For the purposes of this study, the distribution of injuries within the restrained and unrestrained populations are examined. However, it should be noted that restrained occupants experience much lower risk DISTRIBUTION OF INJURIES TO BELTED OCCUPANTS AIS 3+ INJURIES èc "HARM" - FRONTAL CRASHES NASS DATA (U.S.) INJURY PER CENT 0.35 - - - mm ais 3+ H N=263 0.3 - B] rrrr- fïïiï]^ [¿¡U [¿¡U N-5736 0.25 ■ |l||| jijij! - ■ ■ ' ■lilii HÍplj ■ - ■ili:; ■liji: ■lilii ■iii:: - ■lilii ■lili: ■üiii ■iļiii Bpi ° HEAD/FACE NECK CHEST ABDOMEN PELVIS LOWER X UPPER X BODY REGION Figure 2 1982-86 NASS F LE of injury. The reduction in injury risk for restrained occupants has been treated extensively in the literature, and is not addressed in the data presented in this paper. ANALYSIS OF THORAX AND ABDOMINAL INJURY REPORTED IN NASS For the driver and right front passenger, the 1979-86 NASS data base has been interrogated for the frequency of system/lesion pairs for the thorax/ abdominal region, defined as containing the NASS body regions chest, back (thoracolumbar spine), shoulder, and abdomen. Further selection restrictions included the following: Passenger cars only; General area of damage - frontal; No rollover or ejection. Distribution of AIS 3+ injuries and of harm for restrained and unrestrained drivers and unrestrained right front passengers are shown in Table 1. The numbers of serious thorax/ abdominal injuries observed for restrained drivers, unrestrained drivers, and unrestrained right front passengers were 93, 839, and 197, respectively. There was insufficient data on restrained right front passengers to include them in this analysis. Several observations from the data in Table 1 are of interest. For both restrained and unrestrained occupants, serious injuries are widely distributed among many sites. Arterial, heart, liver, pulmonary, and skeletal injuries account for about 60% of the total AIS 3+ counts. Kidney, spleen, and digestive organ injuries account for an additional 16% to 20% of the AIS 3+ counts. Harm weighting significantly alters the apparent importance of the injury sites. The relative significance of injury to the pulmonary system, skeletal system, kidney, and spleen is markedly reduced in the harm accounting scheme. Arterial injuries, although representing approximately 10% of AIS 3+ counts, constitute between 23% (driver) and 31% TABLE 1 INJURY DISTRIBUTION (%) IN FRONTAL COLLISIONS- AIS 3* AND HARM CHESTXABDOMEN INJURIES RESTRAINED UNRESTRAINED UNRESTRAINED DRIVER DRIVER RF PASS.

For restrained drivers, liver injuries are 15 percent of AIS 3+ counts, but account for the largest harm fraction at 21 percent. For the lap and shoulder belt restrained driver, it may be noted that serious injuries also are widely distributed among several injury sites, including the heart, kidney, liver, pulmonary system, and skeleton. Additional analysis of this data may be found in reference (5) . ANALYSIS OF HEAD INJURY REPORTED IN NASS The nature of head injuries in NASS are less well defined than are chest and abdominal injuries. The distribution (by percentage) of serious injuries based on unweighted data is shown in Table 2. The total number of injuries accounted for by each column is also shown. This table indicates that for the combined NASS years 1982-86, brain injuries of all types constituted the major head injury mode for both belted drivers and unbelted occupants. For each group, brain injury constituted at least 60% of the harm. The distribution of lesions within the brain is not available from NASS. Skeletal injuries to the head and face accounted for 38% of the serious head injuries to belted drivers, and 19% of the harm.

Although it is not possible to extract frontal exposures from the general data presented, the findings of this study do provide guidance with respect to the overall shift of injury patterns. Injuries changes post-belt law included: Decreased Injury o Lung and pleura o Kidney o Severe intrathoracic o Driver rib fractures o Driver abdominal contusions o Minor facial o Passenger Skull Fracture o Brain o Eye Increased Injury o Sternal Fracture o Thoracic Contusions o Abdominal Contusions o Driver Facial o Sprained Neck The number of patients, and the bed days of those patients admitted were both significantly reduced after the belt law became effective, according to Rutherford. Harms, et al. (7), generally confirmed Rutherford's findings in a more recent study of crashes involving 1,618 vehicles and 2.720 occupants. The data was weighted to be representative of 5,131 cars. For the frontal impact mode, the weighted data set contained 2506 injured restrained front seat occupants who suffered 6006 injuries. Of these injuries. 296 were AIS 3 or greater. The distribution of injuries is shown in Figure 3. This figure shows the comparative distribution of serious injuries (AIS 3 and greater) and harm. The distributions are generally similar to those shown for the United States in Figure 2. Other principal findings were: o The steering system was the principal source of AIS 2+ injuries to the head and body (34%), followed by the belt webbing (32%) , and upper structure and facia (18%). o Footwell intrusion and pedal displacement were highly related to lower extremity injuries. A study by Dalmotas (8) discusses mechanisms of injury to Canadian 3-point belt wearers, and contains 314 cases which include all principal directions of force. If frontal data only is extracted. 91 drivers and 30 right front passengers remain in the data base. These populations sustained a total of 264 injuries of severity equal to or greater than AIS 2. The distribution of driver and right front passenger injuries by body region is shown in Figure 4. The data shows a predominance of head/ face injuries for the drivers. The injuries to the right front passenger are more evenly distributed among head, chest, pelvis/abdomen, and extremities. Findings from the frontal data indicate that: o Abdominal/pelvic injuries are, relatively speaking, much more prevalent on the passenger side. These injuries represent only 4.5 percent of AIS 2+ counts on the driver side but 22 percent of passenger AIS 2+ counts, o Whereas the few abdominal injuries on the driver side are attributed to wheel rim contact, all abdominal injuries on the passenger side are attributed to local belt intrusion. Concurrent loading of the seat back by a rear seat occupant is cited as an important contributine factor in some cases. 1461</page><page sequence="5">DISTRIBUTION OF INJURIES TO BELTED OCCUPANTS AIS 3 AND GREATER INJURIES - FRONTAL CRASHES BRITISH DATA INJURY PER CENT 0.35 _ I _ AIS 3+ 0 3 ' ļjjļļ] HARM 0 25 ' Mi 0.2 - Hijiji IPM ' HM: Hi M lili H H - H ;: Hiijji Hijiji Htt^t] H - Hmí H M HMÍ H H HM HEAD/FACE NECK CHEST ABDOMEN PELVIS LOWER X UPPER X BODY REGION Figure 3 AFTER HARMS (REF 6) DISTRIBUTION OF INJURIES TO BELTED OCCUPANTS AIS 2+ INJURIES - FRONTAL CRASHES CANADIAN DATA INJURY PER CENT 50 h DRIVER Hi N=200 py' RF PASS 40 - LilJ N=64 30 - H 20 ' H-m H'i i iiiil H 10 ' H'^: H:;:;;i H;:;:; HM: HEAD/FACE NECK CHEST ABO/PEL LOWER X UPPER X OTHER BODY REGION Figure 4 AFTER DEL MOTAS (REF 8) o A distinction vas made between those drivers who contacted the steering assembly and those who did not. Those who were assessed as not making wheel contact experienced only thoracic skeletal fractures» usually following the path of the belt on the torso. Fractures of the clavicle» sternum» and ribs were seen. Drivers who were assessed as making wheel contact did sustain intrathoracic injuries associated with skeletal fractures. Abdominal injuries in these cases» although infrequent» were observed, o Passenger thoracic skeletal fractures again followed the path of the shoulder belt. Internal thoracic injuries were apparently infrequent, but one case of belt induced myocardial contusion was observed in a 58 year old male who was subjected to a crash which caused a low extent of vehicle damage, o The steering assembly caused 95% of the facial injuries and 49% of the head injuries to drivers. However, the most serious head injuries to both driver and passenger came from impacts with the roof or windshield surrounding structure. o A total of four neck injuries were observed. Evidence of contact was not found in any of the cases. Two cases involved serious injury to occupants who were over 60 years of age. o Knee injuries accounted for the largest fraction of the injuries to the lover extremities. Injuries to the knee, lover leg, and ankle-foot were observed to occur at crash severities less than 48 k/hr. Schmidt (9) reports the results of autopsies conducted on 117 car crash victims, also in the Federal Republic of Germany, of whom 54 were known to have been restrained by 3-point belts. Although frontal crash exposures were not specifically reported, a major finding of the study was that passenger compartment intrusion often potentiated serious injury, regardless of belt restraint use or nonuse. In general, however, belted front seat occupants were found to primarily sustain injuries to the trunk, whereas non-belted counterparts received primarily head, limb, and pelvic injuries. Otte, Sudkamp and Appel (10) reported on 1,865 single injuries incurred by 605 belt protected front seat occupants of passenger cars. The injury distributions for driver and right front passenger are shown in Figure 5. Since all injuries are included in this data, the distribution is different from that observed in the earlier figures. The inclusion of lower severity injuries greatly increases the significance of lower extremity injuries. Danner, Langweider and Hummel (11), analyzed injuries to 499 belted drivers and 207 belted right front passengers in the FRG. Approximately 75% of the injuries were less than AIS 2. The authors found that head injuries (50.4%), followed by chest injuries (34.5%) dominated the driver injury pattern. For passengers, chest injuries (44.1%), followed by head injuries (39%) were dominant. Abdominal injuries were third with less than 10% in both occupant positions. However, it was noted that abdominal injuries, when they DISTRIBUTION OF INJURIES TO BELTED OCCUPANTS ALL INJURIES - FRONTAL CRASHES FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF GERMANY INJURY PER CENT 35 _ ^ _ DRIVER 30 ■ Hj HJRF PASS 25 - H ™ 20 ■ Hiiļiļ Hjijij mm 15 • Hiiiii H H [Ml 10 " Hiiiii HiiÜi HiiiÜi Hiiiii HEAD/FACE NECK CHEST ABDOMEN PELVIS LOWER X UPPER X BODY REGION Figure 5 AFTER OHE (REF 10) 1462</page><page sequence="6">occur account for a much larger portion of the serious injuries. This observation explains the reason that abdominal injuries become very significant when AIS 3+ or Harm distributions are examined. INJURY PATTERNS WITH AIR BAGS AND BELT/BAG COMBINATIONS Field data on serious injuries related to air bag and bag/belt exposures are limited at this time. The possibility has been raised» based upon animal studies» that under certain conditions a bag system could deliver a high velocity impulsive load (bag slap) to the human thoracic wall» resulting in blast type chest injury (12) . However» evidence of the occurrence of this type of injury has not been confirmed in the field accident data involving fleets of installed driver bag/belt systems. Backaitis (13) analyzed 112 air bag deployment crashes in the U. S. Government 5 »300 car fleet of air bag equipped Ford Tempos and and police retrofit cars. He found no air bag related injury greater than AIS 1. Kallina (14) examined injuries in Mercedes Benz air bag cars and found 7 fatalities» and 5 serious injuries. No AIS 3 injuries were found below 31 mph and no AIS 4+ were found below 37 mph. The fatalities were attributed to high crash forces during ejections, underrides, omni-directional collisions, and frontal collisions above 50 mph. The 5 serious injuries included 3 chest injuries and 2 lower extremity injuries. The three chest injuries were of AIS 3 severity. The injuries were: o Thorax/heart contusions with sternum fracture o Thorax/heart contusion without sternum fracture o Multiple rib fracture Some of these injuries may have been induced from combined belt and air bag loading by the driver's inertial forces. Munson (15) reported on the field experience with the Tempo/Topaz driver air bag systems a6 of April 20, 1989. He estimated a fleet exposure of 800 million miles, involving 5200 accidents with 620 deployments. His documented deployments number 233 involving 16 moderate injuries. 3 serious injuries, and 3 fatalities. Two of the fatalities were judged to be unsurvivable frontal crashes with large trucks, and the third was in a side crash. No serious injuries were reported in the 27,300 full front air bag fleet of Lincoln Continentals. Thirty-seven deployments which included four right front passengers were known to date. Field data on passenger air bag injuries is inadequate to assess any pattern of chest injuries induced by the restraint system. Testing of passenger air bags at 30. mph with human volunteers reported by Brinkley (16) produced no injury greater than AIS 1. Tests of driver and passenger air bags using cadavers and three sizes of dummies are summarized in reference 17. This reference describes a series of 30 mph frontal, and frontal offset crash tests of the 1974 GM production air bag cars. These vehicles did not include any belt restraint. The most serious injuries observed were to the lower extremities, and were associated with toe pan intrusion. Fracture of three ribs was observed after one offset test. No other internal chest/ abdominal injuries greater than AIS 1 were observed on any specimen protected by an air bag. A series of cadaver tests involving an inflated device intended to apply distributed load to the chest has also been reported by Cheng (18) . This test series produced both skeletal and soft tissue injuries. However, the chest loading device was not representative of present day air bags. Consequently, the relevance of the observed injuries to those which may be induced by air bags is still unclear. OBSERVATIONS FROM SPECIAL REPORTS More than 1000 crash investigations of air bag equipped vehicles have been reported to NHTSA. To date, the number of serious injuries observed is so small that they must be considered as anecdotal. However, it can be observed that the air bags are protecting as designed. One recent case involved a 1988 Chrysler LeBaron convertible and a 1985 Ford Country Squire station wagon. The collision configuration was head-on with a driver side off-set. The computed velocity changes were 41 MPH for the LeBaron, and 29MPH for the Ford. The air bag in the Chrysler provided supplemental restraint for the belted 34 year old female driver. Her principal injuries were a femur fracture from knee contact with the intruding lower instrument panel, and a clavicle fracture from belt loading. There were no abdominal, thoracic or head injuries. The belted female driver of the Ford wagon sustained fatal chest injuries from contact with the steering wheel and hub. It is probable that she was wearing the belt improperly. The three point belt system in conjunction with the air bag appears to have significantly protected the Chrysler driver's head and chest from severe injuries. The record of recent investigations of air bag equipped cars in crashes has shown no significant problems. A few minor complaints have been expressed by accident victims. The principal complaints have been the following: Abrasions to the neck and face Discomfort and minor burns to the thumb or fingers Respiratory discomfort Manufacturers report that these problems are being addressed in future designs. SUMMARY OF DATA AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT Accident data from the United States, 1463</page><page sequence="7">Canada» Britain, and FRG all indicate that, for frontal crashes, the head/face and chest suffer the greatest harm. The abdomen and lower extremities are second, based on the harm distributions shown in Figures 2 and 3. Finally, the neck and upper extremities are third in the harm accounting scheme. The optimization problem for belt restraint systems is confounded by the wide variation of occupant sizes, and injury tolerances. The difficulty in maintaining optimum fit and tension influences the resulting safety and the possibility of misuse. The aging population presents additional optimization needs due to the reduced injury tolerance of older people. As shown in Table 1, the chest and abdominal injuries to belted occupants is widely distributed among several injury sites. These injury sites include the heart, kidney, liver, pulmonary system, and skeleton. Measurements of injury potential for each injury type would be desirable in optimizing the total occupant protection system. Computer simulation of the occupant and restraint system in the crash environment is one promising way to address the difficult problem of safety optimization (19). Many of the reported chest and abdominal injuries are belt induced. Dalmotas (8) suggests the need for reductions in belt induced abdominal injury, particularly for passengers. Danner (11) recommends the use of adjustable d-rings, and lower anchorage points (movable with the seat) to reduce misfit and misuse. These features are now widely available on new cars in the FRG. The use of emergency tensioning retractors has been implemented by Mercedes Benz and Volvo. These devices have the advantage of reducing chest loading by distributing the occupant deceleration over a longer period of time. A reduction in head excursion is a second benefit. The steering system continues to be the major cause of driver facial injury, and a principal cause of head injury. In addition, it contributes to the severity of chest and abdominal injuries. An air bag is a solution that appears to be working in service. The optimization of the air bag/steering system for protection with or without the belt restraint system is a continuing challenge. Head impacts against the surrounding structure are also principal causes of head injury. The design of appropriate structural padding in conjunction with the restraint system is a further need in optimizing safety. In the area of lower extremities, knee protection to reduce injuries at both low and high crash speeds is needed. Safety improvements to reduce injuries from intruding structures are an additional challenge. Neck injuries, while small in numbers, are significant in severity. The data reported by Dalmotas suggests that the lower injury tolerance of the elderly may contribute to the neck injury problem. With regard to air bags, the systems in place are performing as designed. There is insufficient field data to reliably estimate effectiveness of combined belt and bag protection. No significant deficiencies in safety have been identified in service. Design changes to reduce annoyances associated with abrasions and respiratory discomforts need to be incorporated as the systems are further refined. The authors would like to express their appreciation to Mr. Dan Cohen, and Mr. Mark Haffner for their assistance in developing the data for this paper. REFERENCES 1.
