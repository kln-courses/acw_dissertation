<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Absolute Circumstance': Mairi Maclnnes i MAIRI MACINNES was born in 1925 and began to emerge, if that's the word, in the mid-1950s when the Movement was figuring as an event in the history of literary journalism. However, the index to Blake Morrison's The Movement: English Poetry and Fiction of the 1950s reveals how faint a mark she made - one passing reference in a 1956 retrospective by John Wain: 'the present literary generation is the first one in the history of English literature, and quite possibly the last, to have made its début by means of broadcasting . . . Some representative names would be: A. Alvarez, Kingsley Amis, Anthony Hartley, Philip Larkin, Mairi Maclnnes'.1 This list resembles one Amis made some three years before, writing to Wain on 6 November 1953: 'In a list of 28 white hopes of English letters were featured you, of course, me, of course, Al, Philip L, Mairi'.2 Her place in these roll- calls was based on a 'pamphlet of novice poetry',3 Splinters (1953), published by subscription through Wain himself and William McCance at Reading University. The poet's present view of that debut can be judged from the inclusion of just one poem, 'Theomachy ', in The Pebble: Old and New Poems (2000) from the University of Illinois Press. During the same decade a first novel, Admit One (1957), appeared from Putnam - a novel which, somewhat like Larkin's A Girl in Winter , follows the life of a Katharine from 1930s forebodings through to post-war austerity. Despite this promising start, the writer then disappeared entirely from sight. What happened? The short answer is that Mairi Maclnnes became Mairi McGormick. She married an American academic and became the stepmother of a son from 1 Cited in Blake Morrison, The Movement: English Poetry and Fiction of the 1950s (Oxford 1980) p. 43. 2 Zachary Leader, 'Raising Ron Cain: How Amis and Larkin Mocked their own Movement', Times Literary Supplement , 5066, 5 May 2000, p. 15. 3 Mairi Maclnnes, The Pebble: Old and New Poems (Urbana and Chicago 2000) p. 158; also in The Ghostwriter (Newcastle uponTyne 1999) p. 71.

What's more, she left the British Isles, first for Berlin and then, in 1959, for the United States where she was to live for the next twenty- eight years. In 'Why Poetry?', the afterword to The Ghostwriter (1999), Maclnnes sketches the absolute circumstance of this drift from literary view which happened almost fifty years ago: No more inclusion in anthologies, reduced publication in journals, no more invitations to write reviews, no invitations to read at the old ICA off Piccadilly, no poetry evenings with competent poets at George and Paddy Frazer's in Chelsea; no literary parties where William Empson and Kathleen Raine and Janet Adam Smith are kind to the young; no lunch with Kingsley and Hilly Amis at which they pump me for information about the man I am living with. My novel has been published and Olivia Manning and others have reviewed it generously. But that is that. The baby keeps me at home and prevents me from getting to know German society well enough to use it in a second novel. I do not publish another for forty years. But this is life, I think. My husband has forced me to live.4 Nearly two decades later, in Thomas Hardy and British Poetry (1973), Donald Davie quoted 'Hardly Anything Bears Watching' entire, which a footnote indicates had appeared in the Spectator on 16 August 1963. Though an uncharacteristically plain-speaking lament in six quatrains, 'Hardly Anything Bears Watching' has no agenda beyond registering its sense of loss: No comfort from the boy who draws upon my memory of bombs. The man recalls brave days on a far-off sea. Picture after picture fails. When I was young the pavement curbs were made of stone, a substance like my fingernails. It is not like that any more. I do not see the essential life of inorganic things.

Once more though, the critic, with nothing if not an agenda, precipitately tacked on the moral: 'Miss Maclnnes's poem says that to buy sympathy with the human, at the price of alienation from the nonhuman, is a hard bargain at best.'6 'fet this slogan is only partially in tune with, for instance, the evocative and ambivalent simile clinched by a rhyme which makes the 'curbs' of the pavement 'like my fingernails'. The poet herself, like others written about in that book, thought Davie's attention 'occasionally very clever and acute, and occasionally wilfully unjustifiable'.7 That old-style polite 'Miss Maclnnes'also indicates that Davie knew little about the poet's situation in the early 1970s. Attempting to read more of the poetry described as of interest in Davie's book produced, in the case of Mairi Maclnnes, absolutely nothing. And it was only in the mid-1990s that I came across The House on the Ridge Road (1988), published by a small press in Boston, Massachusetts; Elsewhere &amp; Back : New and Selected Poems (1993) published by Bloodaxe; and a novel, The Quondam Wives (1993) from Louisiana State University Press. As the acknowledgements to the Bloodaxe volume indicated, Maclnnes had published a collection called Herring , Oatmeal, Milk &amp; Salt (1981) in Princeton. This proved to be in a series from the Quarterly Review of Literature , a multiple-author sampler containing five separate books. Herring , Oatmeal, Milk &amp; Salt is, then, Maclnnes's first mature collection of poems, while the 1993 volume from Bloodaxe is her first poetry book published in the UK for forty years. Though John Ashbery, in a lecture entitled 'The Invisible Avant-Garde', thought that for such artists the period of neglect has got ever shorter 'so that it now seems to be something like a minute',8 there are still many ways for writers of eventual distinction to remain almost entirely invisible for the best part of a lifetime. II For certain casts of mind, circumstance is 'purely arbitrary', or 'merely contingent' - as if the fact that the world happens to be just so at a particular time on a certain day is an accident, quite meaningless, and that there is no reason why everything could not have been entirely different. Yet, for others, the word 'occasion' points, via its root in the verb 'to fall', 6 Donald Davie, Thomas Hardy and British Poetry (London 1973) pp. 67, 68.

For such writers, seeing the circumstance as art is more a process for recognising how things had to be and of finding what value can be attached to that, less a practice for making meaning out of selected bits in a supposedly chaotic welter. Perhaps it was a leaning towards the first way of seeing things which produced a start at the phrase 'absolute circumstance' and the thought that it was not an oxymoron but an insight. That phrase can be found in the third and final verse to Maclnnes's 'Evening on the Estuary, Noon at Sea', a poem dedicated to the painter Estéban Vincente on his eightieth birthday: Here, as darkness fills out, absolute circumstance also begins to bloom. The colors of land and water grow deep in reflected light. Here and in your painting, master, what's allowed will happen. The eye arrives alone at its center, its eventual passion.9 Immediately appealing in this stanza is its unemphatic, interwoven music: how 'out' at the first line -end exfoliates into the 'absolute' with its echoing last syllable, how the first five letters of the same word, shuffled and minus the 'b', generate 'also', or how that dropped 'b' is then picked up by the alliteration of the third line whose 'n' and 'm' consonants reverse those of 'circumstance'. Similarly, the last syllable of 'happen' is taken into the first of 'centre', and the second of 'eventual', while 'alone' in the middle of the penultimate line prepares for the hidden almost-rhyme with 'passion' at the close. There is also muted part-rhyming in the interspersed sequence of 'water . . . master . . . center' and in 'happen . . . passion'. On 3 February 1818, Keats wrote praising poetry which 'does not startle' one's soul 'or amaze it with itself - but with its subject. How beautiful are the retired flowers! - how would they lose their beauty were they to throng into the highway, crying out, "Admire me, I am a violet! Dote upon me, I am a primrose!"'10 Maclnnes's music blooms like Keats's thankfully retired 9 Mairi Maclnnes, The House on the Ridge Road (Boston, Mass. 1988) p. 32; repr. with alternate lines indented in Elsewhere &amp; Back : New and Selected Poems (Newcastle uponTyne 1993) p. 20. 10 John Keats, 'To J. H. Reynolds', 3 Feb. 1818, in Letters ed. S. Colvin (London 1935) p. 68.</page><page sequence="5">MAIRI MACINNES 111 flowers. Her style instances 'absolute circumstance' too, for its sounding as a fait accompli appears to be happening as the occasion befalls. The first two verses of 'Evening on the Estuary, Noon at Sea' prepare for this conclusion by essaying similarities and differences between the composition of an art work and of a natural scene. In the estuary, as 'Ash drifts thick in mile-wide smears | far out at sea', this process is 'emptying content' - something a painting stops time precisely to avoid; in the second stanza, where the poet remembers 'riding out of Orkney | on the ferry to Scrabster', It was midsummer in the far north, the air very bright, the wind hard at work - so much haled out of the fabric of matter and tuned like matter, luminous, excited by present arrival in Caithness. The 'so much' Maclnnes's poem evokes may also be 'absolute circumstance' in which the 'fabric of matter' is 'tuned like matter'. Her poetry's idea of art appears a texture and attunement learned from the ordering of the natural world itself. It can be found as meaning, though, only when experienced as the 'present arrival' of a human 'circumstance' - for that word also implies a point of attention around which everything else may be understood to stand. This is another reason why Davie's moral is rendered partial through the implication that human sympathy could ever be had at the expense of the non-human, or the non-human have significance without a human presence. At the start of a rare venture into academic writing, the poet underlines how the absolute circumstance in a human perspective also contributes to the occasion of meaning: 'The idea of alcoholism, like the idea of a city, has grown up complicated by our needs as witnesses, quite apart from variation in the thing itself.'11 Her poems are especially sensitive to the complicating variations of 'our needs as witnesses' in a questioning relation to 'variation in the thing itself'. She achieves this by doing without over- insistences of incantation or interpretation - as in 'Among the Sea Islands, Georgia', where change and dereliction leave just a few stone markers of human effort: 'Only milestones in woods are left, | pointing to lost plantations, | and the gravestones of "Lotty," "Tib".' The feeling she then announces is still not 'sympathy with the human', for the poet's exclamation is produced by the absence of occasion for human solidarity: 11 Mairi McGormick, 'First Representations of the Gamma Alcoholic in the English Novel', Quarterly Journal of Studies on Alcohol, 30/4 (Dec. 1969) p. 957.</page><page sequence="6">112 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY 'How sad, somehow, it is, | this scrupulous lack of consequence!' Whatever the expressed needs of the poet as witness, her articulated desire to have the scene religiously transformed through spring's arrival is rebuked by the qualifying context of what follows : What if the spring lets fall its present like a canticle, and snakes coil warming in the path, and that painted bunting like a pentecostal flame flickers in the bush? The boatman does not care. He checks his fine gold watch and says it's time to go. A squall is coming. We cannot wait. Nothing to be done about this. Nothing matters now.12 The boatman represents a different relationship between humanity and circumstance. He has his weather-eye open. His beckoning the visitors back to the boat underlines the lack of consequence narrated, while the poem renders that desolating recognition as of consequence. If such meaning is inevitably a human addition to the scene, it aspires to the condition of those stone markers, not an inscription that has overwhelmed the scene's condition of truth, but one that acknowledges the landscape's contribution to what the human meaning could possibly be. It is as if you can't have one without the other - usually the case with poets whose work is prompted by ambivalence about lived occasions. Ill 'Welcome to Mendocino', among Maclnnes's most sustained perfor- mances, is described by Richard Wilbur on the back cover of The House on the Ridge Road as a 'delectable poem' whose author is 'amusedly objective'. This complex of authorial attitude and readerly pleasure also touches on her invitations towards, and withdrawals from, environment. The completed poem in six parts opens with some non-human stuff, from which the poet seems neither alienated nor sympathetic: A tremendous sea, covered with experienced waves. Crumbling sandstones cliffs, their rock lodes, their lofty citadels, cut out and marooned. 12 The Pebble, ppA0-'.</page><page sequence="7">MAIRI MACINNES 113 Seaweed, sea lions, and a set of pelicans assumed, and the sea passing them by, the mastering element, the present controller. The opening line sees the 'tremor' in 'tremendous' and knows that the place is near the San Andreas Fault, being 'some ninety miles, half a day from San Francisco'. Beauty and fear are again not far apart. For development, it interleaves this account of the Pacific coastline with an attention to the human dimensions of the historic place: 'They went home to add a superfluous fret | of wooden filigrees to eaves and rails, | ... an outside staircase twined like morning glory'.13 Her poem similarly twines together the perpetual presence of the indifferent sea with the vicinity's comic or sad human dimensions: 'the tourist, touched with fire' whose 'eyes prickle' and whose 'wallet's heavy' as he 'muses from shop to shop and buys expensively, I the sea at his back, the malign neglected sea', for instance, or, after a description of some 'amaryllis as in Greek Sicily', Maclnnes adds: ' "Naked Ladies," | frowns the prim innkeeper, and slashes off their heads.' Her third section begins: 'Unionised labor's gone inland, | gone to the back country, | where the sea is musing and gentle'. Yet Maclnnes is most exercised by that 'tremendous sea, covered with experienced waves'. But 'experienced' waves? The epithet implies a bargaining with the non- human. She strikes this note again in part two with 'the experienced sea' and 'the malign neglected sea', and it's the theme she returns to at her poem's close: The sea grumbles far away, the sea devoid of honor, gobbling, dangerous, cold, forever missing something, it doesn't know what. 'Oh, for God's sake!' it cries, and bellows all night through the lace curtains of the famous Mendocino inn. What if the only thing wrong is the moon? The sea wants its words too, to declare that it is various and detailed and craves to be looked at, and gives of itself for ever. It only imagines it is hungry, full as it must be with continent wolfed. 'The sea wants its words too', perhaps because this final section does end the poem properly, as the five-part version printed in The House on the Ridge Road fails to do. The earlier text stops with the 'perfectly round stones of Mendocino' that 'the two Marys' have gathered as souvenirs. The stones 13 This and subsequent citations are from The Pebble , pp. 46-51; for the five-part version, The House on the Ridge Road , pp. 36-42; the revised version is also in Elsewhere &amp; Back , pp. 68-72.</page><page sequence="8">114 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY are doubtless smoothed by the action of the sea, but seem to have been gathered into the trinket sphere of human sympathy, and their power as symbols combining the non-human with a human function is muffled. Maclnnes seems, in revising, to have acknowledged the sea's need to be both first and last. Naturally, the poem too wants its words - as Maclnnes makes clear enough in 'I Object, Said the Object', an important piece for her development which' Why Poetry ?' comments on at length. In its final verse, what must be new poems come 'uttering sounds unchosen, spontaneous, not I chidden, flocking'.14 Yet what comes flocking in 'Welcome to Mendocino' is a personification of the sea which sounds appropriate and chosen. This descriptive anthropomorphism is rendered benign by a Bishop-like 'joking voice, a gesture | I love',15 which recalls the older writer's poem 'The Bight': the water in the bight doesn't wet anything, the color of a gas flame turned as low as possible. One can smell it turning to gas; if one were Baudelaire one could probably hear it turning to marimba music.16 Maclnnes'sjoking style ('So what's the sea been up to?') acknowledges that you can't describe anything without turning it into the terms of the human, but by doing so in a knowingly whimsical style makes the helplessness of the gesture quite evident, which in turn allows the elemental forces their vast and indifferent autonomy. 'Not wanting to be there where you are is the beginning of all this business', the poet John Welch has written, and 'In imagination you had to be somewhere else'.17 Maclnnes presents such relationships of imagination to resistance and displacement as a familial conflict in the memoir- essay which gives Herring , Oatmeal, Milk &amp; Salt its title. The poet's father, a Hebridean doctor who spent his working life in County Durham, experienced the immediate surroundings of the north-east as an exile: So did he offer me only the famous Scottish sentiment, filletted of fact and analysis? My mother, who'd come from Australia, scoffed. Her past was long ago and far away - nearly out of sight. But he was more 14 The Pebble , p. 25; for her discussion of the poem, see pp. 160-3; Elsewhere &amp; Back, p. 57, and The Ghostwriter , pp. 73-5. 15 Elizabeth Bishop, Complete Poems 1927-1979 (New'brk 1983) p. 178. 16 Ibid. p. 60. 17 John Welch, 'The Life of It', PN Review 138, 27/4 (Mar-Apr. 2001) p. 12.</page><page sequence="9">MAIRI MACINNES 115 bound to his place of origin than she was. He had a message to pass on. She not only kept quiet about the past, but saw no value in it.18 So the mother, who put her earlier life behind her to live the present as fully as possible, demonstrates less attachment to place than the father, who, because of his longing for elsewhere, has an ambivalent relationship to present circumstance. It is as if in order fully to register the immediate surroundings you have to be both tied to them by obligations and resistant to them because of a prior sense of loyalty to other absent places. The father's exile generates a vividly unhappy relationship to location - where the mother's expatriation and amnesia produces a toughly indifferent acceptance. Such conflictual themes come through in many of Maclnnes's poems, especially those set in the USA, where, despite nearly three decades' residence, she was never able to feel entirely at home. 'The Scots in America' takes this as its subject, beginning with a memory of the poet's aunt in Scotland who had said, providing a refrain-like opening for each of three verses, 'The Scots is a proud people', and, offering a contrast which appears at the opening and near the close, 'The English is an ignorant people.' Maclnnes's poem notes that she speaks the tongue of the ignorant ones and is only part Scots - such an identity with a border running through it like disputed terrain being common in the British Isles. Her sense of not quite fitting at a 'Highland Service' in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, is a nuanced one: and I was surprised to hear the minister, Mr. Vanderboost, wore borrowed kilts and the ten pipers in full Highland fig were costumed by Canadian mail order. None of them had set foot in Scotland, and it didn't matter, for when they played the ancient airs of the Covenanters as on a sequestered moor, no eye was dry, and a summer storm whipped up outside to rip the soft leaves from the churchyard trees and drench the church's plain glass windows with an almost familiar rain.19 In Maclnnes's case, resistance to environment is produced by an understated detachment in the description, a style which serves to let the 18 Herring, Oatmeal , Milk &amp; Salt, p. 40.

But what appears to finesse this turn is not the pipers' airs producing tears, but the natural event of the summer storm which comes to recall rain drenching the face on a sequestered moor. IV Maclnnes's views of marriage, nature, culture, and displacement seem at least partly rooted in her mother's having met her father at Gallipoli, where she served as a nurse. The poet's admiration for her mother's war service is warmly explored in 'Why Poetry?'20 The couple met in a field hospital and, after the end of hostilities, her mother abandoned life in Australia and came to the British Isles. 'The Caul', dedicated to her, evokes the young Australian on a ship docking at Tilbury in February 1919. Seeing her husband-to-be again, away from the 'deaths and chaos' of the 'bitter Greek winters under canvas', she finds 'a stranger | in shabbiest tweeds, whom she felt nothing for', and so, 'while cranes hoisted kit in great nets | and orderlies toted her trunk ashore, panic | struck her'.21 The Americanism 'toted' appears to interthread the poet's experiences of marriage and emigration with those of her parent before her. This episode from how her mother was 'cut | into the pack after all, and dealt' is returned to in '1919': Repeat it, however: in that wintry Bloomsbury room in the run-up to marriage, she dreams malarial dreams; dreams and drowns in grief, cries out for company, oranges, clean sheets, aspirin, tea, her bevies of sisters, the Murray River, past lovers . . .22 The poem sounds out the traces of a life as echoing through the 'bevies' that grew up by a 'river' where 'lovers' were known. Do poetic effects like this produce an arbitrary illusion of inevitability, or pay tribute to the exactness of things being precisely thus as they unfolded? By not underlining such confluences of sound, but letting them make their momentary points, the poem demonstrates an affinity with the second possibility. In 'The Old Naval Airfield' Maclnnes approaches the circumstance of her own past love, but not without reluctance: 20 The Pebble , pp. 154-6; The Ghostwriter , pp. 68-9. 21 The Pebble , p. 103; The Ghostwriter , p. 41. 22 The Pebble, p.m.</page><page sequence="11">MAIRI MACINNES 117 I looked out Henstridge lately, somewhere where it always was, even then, without maps or signs, and thought of Philip, chief flying instructor, brave Philip, who soon was dead; long ago, though, many years ago.23 An earlier version, called 'The Old Naval Airfield at Henstridge, Dorset' and first collected in 1988, suggests how reluctant Maclnnes was to approach this matter. The lines from 'and thought of Philip' to 'many years ago' do not appear. Her poem runs straight to 'Pretty old, bosky old, footpath I country' and takes the reader on a walk to the airfield, where it discovers 'the rusted roof of a hangar | half-fallen in' and then 'look, | the old control tower, a tall wreck | marooned in breaking waves of grass!' In revision this becomes 'Philip's control tower'. The earlier text has just two verses, the second pulling back from the rendered scene to exemplify, mysteriously, what the airfield meant: Survival is a form of murder. My father ran round the garden in the dark shouting, 'She's dead, and I could've done more for her. I could have, and I didn't.' She'd said earlier, 'He couldn't do more, that man, best man who ever lived.' Truth is, you can always do more. You have to survive, that too, but it's murder. He lived on, as you do if you can.24 The one change to this verse for later printings is that 'done more' moves to the next line, an improvement in the enjambed deploying of sense, which lets the line- end repetitions of 'murder' (with first apparently literal, then idiomatic, usages) and the 'do more' echo more clearly because not overplayed. In 'The Old Naval Airfield at Henstridge, Dorset' a reader assumes a link between the story of her father's grief and the visit to the old airfield, one which prompts those intensely articulated lessons from experience in the final three lines; yet what has produced them can only be guessed from the remains of the wartime scene. This sends the reader back to the airfield, trying to decipher its relevance to what comes later. The problem is, though, that in the absence of maps or signs, the reader will likely fictionalise a pilot and sweetheart story which may, in the absence of 23 The Pebble , p. 35; as two verses with alternate lines indented, Elsewhere &amp; Back , p. 21. 24 The House on the Ridge Road , p. 26.</page><page sequence="12">118 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY detail, confuse the poem's absolute circumstance. The revised version appreciates that the narration of scene alone does not make the experience intelligible enough to readers as they encounter the surroundings. Here, the flowering of the meaning's occasion has been more difficult, and part of what that involved only a later poem reveals. The flying instructor who is first implicitly remembered in 'The Old Naval Airfield at Henstridge, Dorset', and then at least named and made part of the circumstance in 'The Old Naval Airfield', appears to have been a wartime love, someone rather differently mourned in 'Passion', from The Ghostwriter : I said at home: 'I heard he was killed.' My mother barely paused. 'Perhaps it's just as well.' 'But only twenty-eight, and after five years of war, accidentally killed? That's not unfair for a real hero, one of the best, as everyone said? Don't you think it's a waste?' These jarringly rhymed, ambivalent couplets are mended with the full chime of the poem's end: 'his birdwing smile, and enchanting air of belief | in me - too soon at odds with grief'.25 With this close, the things at odds are set more nearly at one. 'Passion' lays to rest what 'The Old Naval Airfield' timorously approaches and veers away from by overlaying, on the story of her wartime love, the difficult matter of her mother's death and her own mourning for the person who had made that somewhat resented and still puzzling remark about the young man's death being 'just as well'. Perhaps the mother, habituated to dismissal of the past, thought the airman somehow not suitable for her daughter - or that anyway pining wouldn't bring him back. The young woman's view was different, as can be sensed from her early poem 'Lament', where she writes of how the heart would 'Leap to see the wings of his brows | Softly inclined towards me', and ends: 'Through the empty stations of the night | My love is passed and gone'.26 If those 'stations' are on the railway lines of young people's assignations, they may also be the 'air stations' of a flight instructor, with other wings than his eyebrows. Maclnnes's fiction represents marriage as setting women at odds with their circumstances, and then finds them inclined to take revenge for displacement by hitting out at the environment. The theme feels discovered in the process of writing Admit One. Towards the book's close, Katherine, now an MP's wife, attempts some amateur social work in her husband's 25 The Pebble , p. 107; The Ghostwriter, pp. 44-5. 26 Mairi Maclnnes, Splinters (Reading 1953) p. 7.</page><page sequence="13">MAIRI MacINNES 119 constituency and half-haplessly risks wrecking his career by involving the press - vitiating the jejune attempt to do some good as well. Though the book's blurb says her husband 'is forced to take Katharine more seriously' while ťin terror, she in turn finds a comfortable protector', its closing pages where the young wife's misjudgements are accommodated by the MP feel more like a capitulation, a loss, and Maclnnes's prose leaves the issues more dispiritingly open than the blurb would seem to like: 'On the gleaming roadway she paused a while, the blue white glare of the street lamps turning her lips a livid purple and her hair ashen, and then she decided, and began to walk homewards.' That detail of the 'street lamps turning her lips a livid purple' echoes the description of an unknown woman's sexual encounter with a stranger some twenty pages earlier: 'We were standing under those livid lights that turn lipstick purple.'27 The identity of the woman as Katharine is thus confirmed at the point where she appears with 'livid' lips and 'ashen' hair to commit herself to 'walk homewards'. In The Quondam Wives a similar theme is consciously and more fully worked out when, in a convincing rewrite of the Lear plot, the two elder sisters attempt to revitalise a country house and bankrupt estate by turning it into a tourist trap while, at the same time, planning to let an extraction company excavate for gravel to build a motorway. This rape of the countryside is headed off by a reshaping of the tragic end in which revenge is enacted by the circumstance of 'A storm, with thunder and lightning'. The consequences are that the ghastly plans are abandoned. The resistant environment itself has taken revenge on the vengeful plot of the elder daughters, killing the culpable father and the opting- out daughter into the bargain: 'Dark clouds congregated over the high wood. The green of the parkland was livid.'28 That same word 'livid', used with muted ambiguity at the close of Admit One , now more overtly focuses the entire book's theme: the parkland may be a strange, stormy colour, but this time it's clearly furious too. Maclnnes's novel includes two characters who have no equivalents in Shakespeare's play: the Lear character's ex- wife and mother of the elder daughters, Alice, an American businesswoman, and Esmé, his much younger second wife and mother of the Cordelia character. The plans to wreck the countryside are thus intimately connected with the motives of the elder daughters, who have been shaped by a failed marriage with an American who was living in England. So the event which most troublingly links the non-human and the human for Maclnnes is, perhaps not surprisingly, marriage - because she 27 Mairi Maclnnes, Admit One (London 1956) pp. 1, 99, 223. 28 Mairi Maclnnes, The Quondam Wives (London and Baton Rouge, La. 1993) p. 113.</page><page sequence="14">120 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY also appreciates that the human is part of the non-human in so far as natural forces are driving through us all. That early love which came to grief makes the young poet's heart leap like an 'Exulting dolphin'.29 But, as Richard Wollheim has aptly noted, 'the parallel in the sexual sphere to talking of an artistic instinct would be to postulate a "matrimonial" instinct'.30 The natural forces driving through us have to be organised by culturally possible forms if they are to result in the beneficial creation of children or art. Naturally, for a mother who is also a writer, these mediated desires to create may appear in conflict, and themselves the occasion for painful displacements and losses. In the last paragraph of 'Why Poetry?' Maclnnes throws down a challenge: 'Writing about the conflict, I put in jeopardy what I have been at great pains to preserve, and for this reason, I suspect: that literature itself is about fidelity and the efforts to escape it, with all the accompanying pains and joys.'31 The word 'escape' upsets expectations here by describing writing as an ambivalent attachment to, and attempt to gain freedom from, the circumstances of a life. Yet the terms for this irreducible ambivalence are always in need of resolutions achieved on a once only basis in works such as Maclnnes's 'Learning Another Language': In another part of the forest The thrushes sing in different phrases. In each part, the melodies are distinct. Castaway on the massive body of the earth (Sky overhead pale and empty as a page), You, poor fool, feel flints puncture your skin. O self! O drench of meaning!32 While Maclnnes's memoir, After All (forthcoming from Knopf/ Pantheon), will likely flesh out that self's drench of meaning in her less visible decades, it is first and foremost with her poetry that the 'Castaway' circumstances of a life have bloomed as the absolute circumstance of art. And after all, those decades of invisibility were the condition in which, for better or worse, her impressively independent loco -descriptive poetry has demonstrated how the conflict of fidelity with escape can result in a fine responsiveness over the distances.
