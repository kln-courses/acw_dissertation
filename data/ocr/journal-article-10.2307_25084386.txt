Fr?hlich Department of Biology, Bee Biology &amp; Systematics Laboratory, Utah State University, UMC 53, Logan, Utah 84322 abstract: The within-nest construction and provisioning behavior o? Osmia (Chenosmia) bruneri is described. Incorporation of an abdom inal secretion into the provision is hypothesized, and oviposition and the use of female body length to measure cell size are described. The subgeneva Acanthosmioides, Nothosmia, Chenosmia and Monilosmia are compared, and discrepancies between nesting biologies and architectures, and phylogenetic relationships at the subgeneric level are pointed out. The entomological literature contains many accounts of life histories and nesting biologies of solitary bees and wasps, but few of these attempt to associate nesting behaviors or nest architectures with phylogenetic relationships. Of those that do, Eickwort and Sakagami (1979), Eickwort et al. (1981), and Evans (1966) have to a large degree utilized nesting characteristics to classify and/or to explain evolu tionary trends in several hymenopterous taxa. Nest types, orientation of cells, construction materials, cell caps, and types of provisions were used to elucidate generic relationships in the Augochlorini that were not apparent in adult mor phology (Eickwort and Sakagami, 1979) and to explain the evolution of the Mega chilinae (Eickwort et al., 1981). Evans (1966) also used nest architecture and organization, and general ethology in classifying the nyssonine wasps. The bee genus Osmia Panzer is a taxon currently in systematic disarray, but it is one for which much biological information, compared to other genera, is known. With such information available, it would seem logical to use it as an aid in interpreting the evolution of the genus. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to describe the within-nest construc tion, provisioning, and egg-laying behavior of Osmia (Chenosmia) bruneri Cock erell; (2) to compare the nesting biologies of four subgenera: Acanthosmioides Ashmead, Nothosmia Ashmead, Chenosmia Sinha, and Monilosmia Robertson; (3) to suggest a re-examination of subgeneric relationships based on nesting biology as well as anatomical characters. Methods and Materials Osmia bruneri is a medium sized, metallic blue megachilid bee that ranges from Montana to New Mexico and British Columbia to California. Individuals over winter as adults and emerge in the spring to visit a wide variety of flowers. The species is presumed to be polylectic (Hurd, 1979). It is known to use pre-existing holes to nest in (Hicks, 1926) and will utilize artificial domiciles (F. D. Parker, pers. comm.). Individuals were removed from nests in elderberry twigs that had been placed Accepted for publication 14 July 1982.</page><page sequence="2">124 JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY Figs. 1-4.

The population had initially been obtained from com mercial leafcutting bee boards at a farm 3 mi east of Richmond, Utah, in the summer of 1979. Emergent individuals were released 13 May 1981 into a greenhouse (6 X 6 X 5 m) that contained a 1 X 1 X 2.5 m observation box equipped with nesting material. Glass tubes 6 mm in diameter and of varying lengths and elderberry sticks that had been cut approximately in half longitudinally and covered with a clean glass plate were used as nesting materials (Fig. 1). Holes 6 mm in diameter and of different lengths were drilled in each stick. Sticks were mounted on the observation box so that the entrance opening was visible from within. Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth. and Melilotus alba Desr. were provided as pollen and nectar sources, and Oenothera hookeri T. &amp; G. was planted for leaf material. A digital stopwatch, tape recorder, flashlight and otoscope were used to record observations. Results Females began nesting by 24 May. Over the course of the study, portions of the nesting behavior of 12 different females were observed. The following is a composite account, in temporal sequence, from preparation of a new nest to nest closure. Each behavior discussed was observed several times in different females. cell construction: Osmia bruneri constructed two types of partitions: basal</page><page sequence="3">VOLUME 56, NUMBER 2 125 or apical partitions that enclosed the provision, and partitions that separated entire cells (Figs. 2, 3). Basal partitions were concave, with the concavity directed toward the interior of the cell, and consisted of masticated Oenothera leaves and elderberry pith (Fig. 3). The female often modified the back of the burrow before laying down the first basal partition. Nests were modified by cutting away large chunks of pith with the mandibles and dropping them outside during flight. After modifying its nest hole, the female collected leaf material, and carried it to the nest as a shiny ball held between the mandibles and placed it on the floor at the back of the nest. She then removed portions of leaf pulp from the sphere and formed a circle of leaf material around the inner circumference of the tunnel. Leaf material was added to the circle until a flat plate of leaf pulp was formed. More leaf material was then added to the center of the growing partition and worked outwardly with the mandibles and fore-legs until the partition reached approxi mately half its destined thickness. The female then cut from 10 to 20 small bits of pith with the mandibles from the side walls of its nest and removed these en masse to the partition where they were pressed into the matrix with mandibles and fore-legs. Subsequently, pith was usually added between additional deposi tions of leaf pulp. As the partition thickened, the bee formed a concavity on its outer surface by spreading the partition matrix to the sides and compacting the center by pressing on it with the front legs. Formation of the basal partition took about 30 minutes and required 3 to 6 leaf-gathering trips. Once the basal partition was constructed, the inner surface was coated with a secretion applied by the tongue and mouthparts. The secretion was clear, not discernible on drying, and applied only to the partition. Before provisioning began, a threshold that would become the apical partition was laid down. Upon returning to the nest after completion of the basal partition the female ran to the back of the nest and touched her head to the partition several times, backing up each time. She finally stretched out, placed her head against the partition and planted the tip of her abdomen against the floor. Keeping the abdominal tip in place, she curled into a 'c' shape, brought her mouth to the abdominal tip, and deposited a small clump of leaf pulp on the floor. By adding leaf material to the clump, she laid down a thin line of pulp in a ring around the circumference of the tunnel. Occasionally females made two reference deposits of leaf pulp by measuring twice in the same manner, and depositing a mouthful of pulp on each side of the tunnel. The two were then connected by adding pulp to the walls and ceiling until a ring was formed. Total body length was used to delimit cell length only in the cells deepest within the nest. More distal cells were constructed proportionately smaller in size, and the measuring behavior changed. When estimating the position of the threshold in the shorter, outermost cells, the female placed her head against the basal partition, turned on her side and curled into a 'c' shape. While she was curled in this shape, the tip of her abdomen was placed on the floor, the mouth brought to this point and leaf material deposited. For both inner and outer cells masticated leaf material was added to floor and wall portions of the completed threshold ring until an opening slightly larger than the bee remained. This apical partition was flattened on both sides when the female partially inserted herself through the opening and pressed portions of the partition between her mandibles and the tip of her abdomen like a forceps. Between 3 and 9 leaf-collecting trips were required to form the threshold.</page><page sequence="4">126 JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY The formation of basal partitions and thresholds in glass tubes was the same as in elderberry sticks with one exception: no pith was incorporated into the leaf matrix. However, females were observed to make cutting motions with the man dibles along the length of the tube but desisted after a few seconds to begin another leaf-collecting trip. provisioning: Provisioning ensued upon completion of the threshold. During the first few provisioning trips only pollen was deposited on the cell floor. The female backed into the cell and kicked pollen from the scopal hairs of the venter with the hind legs, then began another foraging bout. Pollen and nectar were collected on almost all subsequent trips. After the first 1 to 3 pollen depositions, the female returned head first and regurgitated nectar onto the dry pollen mass. The nectar was worked into the provision with the mandibles until a moist and pasty pollen loaf was formed. After kneading the provision, she turned around within the nest and deposited pollen onto the moist provision surface and left. This sequence of nectar regurgitation-kneading-pollen deposition-foraging bout was followed until oviposition. After pollen deposition and prior to beginning the next foraging trip, the female spent some time grooming the abdominal sterna and tip of the abdomen. Typi cally, the bee lay on her back and vigorously groomed sterna with the hind legs. After several seconds the middle legs began to move very quickly and groomed the hind legs which stopped moving. The front legs then groomed the middle legs and passed a tiny, clear droplet of liquid to the mouth where it was vigorously chewed. The female then left immediately. This behavior lasted an average of 58.7 seconds (?30.4 sec; range 15 sec-5.9 min) and occurred whenever nectar was to be deposited on return from the next trip. The droplet was observed only on the legs and not emanating from any one part of the abdomen. Since the grooming behavior was one smooth motion, from beginning of abdominal groom ing to chewing the droplet, it is assumed that the source of the liquid is somewhere on the abdomen. Foraging trips averaged only 3 min 20 sec (?55.9 sec; range 1.6 min-5.2 min, N = 96) and up to 49 trips were required to complete one provision. Nectar r?gurgitation took an average of 25.6 sec (? 10.8 sec, range 11 sec-1.4 min, N = 46) and pollen deposition took an average of 24.5 sec (?11.5 sec, range 10-35 sec, N = 46). During the first phases of provisioning, the pollen loaf was manipulated by the mandibles and front legs until it filled the concavity in the basal partition. As the provision grew, it almost filled the cell to about one-third of the distance from the apical partition. At this point the face of the provision sloped to the base of the threshold. Once the provision touched the threshold only 3 to 5 additional pollen loads were added. oviposition and cell closure: In all cases oviposition immediately followed the last foraging trip. The final foraging bout differed from others in that only nectar was collected. On returning, the female regurgitated nectar onto the face of the pollen loaf and worked it in with the mandibles. She then backed out of the nest, turned, re-entered and assumed a very rigid posture. The egg was extruded and its posterior one-third was pushed into the center of the provision surface. At this point the bee usually waited about 30 seconds before pulling away and freeing the remainder of the egg. Once the egg was completely extruded, the</page><page sequence="5">VOLUME 56, NUMBER 2 127 anterior portion came to lie on the surface of the pollen mass so that both ends touched the provision. Closure of the apical partition began immediately after oviposition, proceeding in the same manner as formation of the basal partition with one exception. Just prior to closing the partition the female inserted one mandible through a tiny hole remaining in the center of the partition, then by opening and closing the mandibles in rapid succession she chewed the whole partition. More masticated leaf material and pith were then added until a concavity on the outer surface was formed. nest closure: After completion of a cell a second cell was sometimes started using the apical partition of the previous cell as a new basal partition. Alternatively a second cell was constructed at variable distances from the previous cell. In this case it did not appear that the distance between the two cells was measured. In single-celled nests several partitions were usually constructed between the pro visioned cell and the nest plug. These partitions were made of the same leaf pulp and pith as basal-apical partitions but were flattened and disk-shaped, without the typical concavity-convexity. They also appeared to be placed randomly rather than at measured intervals. Several females were observed to run up and down in a spiralling fashion around the inner surface of the nest, while carrying a mouthful of leaf pulp. After spiralling several times, each female stopped, de posited a clump of leaf material, and then constructed a single partition. Single celled nests contained as many as 8 single partitions, forming 8 empty cells and a vestibular cell (Fig. 4). Single-celled nests were the rule in glass tubes, whereas no fewer than 3 cells were constructed in any elderberry stick. Nest plugs were thicker than partitions, were made of both masticated leaf material and pith, and were usually recessed 3 to 10 mm from the entrance. Plugs ranged from 2 to 7 mm thick, while partitions ranged from slightly less than 1 mm to just over 2 mm. The plugs were constructed in the same manner as partitions, with a ring of leaf pulp first placed around the inner circumference of the nest. Leaf pulp with pith was added until a flat disk was formed and then thickened into a plug, with a surface ranging from flat to concave. Discussion Abdominal grooming and the ingestion of a glandular secretion during provi sioning has not been reported for other megachilids. Batra (1980) reported that Collet?s inaequalis Say, C. thoracicus Smith and C valida Cresson removed a secretion of Dufour's gland from the sting with the glossa and applied this as part of the cell lining. Batra (1972) also noted species in several families other than the Megachilidae that utilized Dufour's gland secretions when lining cells. The function of the secretion collected from the posterior part of the body and ingested by O. bruneri is unknown. Because ingestion occurs only during grooming prior to pollen and nectar collecting trips, the substance may modify the provision as it is deposited. Perhaps the secretion serves to inhibit pollen germination, acts as a mold retardant, or contains an essential nutritional factor that is added to the provision. Threshold building has been observed in several species of Osmia. Osmia lignaria Say (Rust, 1974), O. pumila Cresson (Krombein, 1967), O. marginata Michener (Parker and Tepedino, 1982a), and O. ge?rgica Cresson (Hartman et al., 1944) are known to construct thresholds, while O. cornifrons (Radoszkowski) does</page><page sequence="6">128 JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY not (Rust, 1974). Parker and Tepedino (1982a) state that O. marg?nala appears to equate roughly the length of the cell with the length of the body and thus measure the position of the threshold. Hartman et al. (1944) dismiss the concept of "mea suring" as pure anthropomorphism. The fact that cell size of O. bruneri changes predictably from inner to outer cells and that this change is accompanied by consistent changes in female behavior when positioning thresholds strongly sug gests that females are indeed "measuring." Much of the nesting biology of O. bruneri is similar to that of other members of the subgenus Chenosmia: O. pr?xima Cresson (Fye, 1965; Medler, 1967), O. atriventris Cresson (Fye, 1965), O. tersula Cockerell (Medler, 1967) and O. gau diosa Cockerell (Krombein, 1967) all build cells in a linear series in pre-existing holes, utilize masticated leaf material for cell partitions and closing plugs, and do not line cell walls. Osmia atriventris also incorporates wood fibers from the nest into partitions. Vestibular cells in these species can be long, and it is common to find several empty cells. Pollen mass characteristics are known only for O. atri ventris, which forms a moist, pasty provision apparently similar to that of O. bruneri. Fye (1965) states that the egg adheres to the provision but does not indicate that it floats in a pool of nectar. Actual within-nest behavior has not been reported for any Chenosmia other than O. bruneri. Parker (1975) has noted the taxonomic confusion in the genus Osmia, and G. E. Bohart (pers. comm.) believes that Chenosmia and Monilosmia should be combined into a single subgenus along with portions of Nothosmia. The current classification system in the genus Osmia is based on a phylogenetic scheme pro posed by Sinha (1958) in which Chenosmia and Monilosmia are closely related and Acanthosmioides and Nothosmia have a common ancestor. If this is the case, one would expect nesting biologies of species of Nothosmia to be more similar to those of Acanthosmioides than to Chenosmia. In contrast, the literature suggests that nesting characteristics of Nothosmia and Chenosmia are strikingly similar while both are decidedly different from those of most species of Acanthosmioides. Nesting biology of 4 of the 21 species o? Nothosmia is known. Osmia marginata (Parker and Tepedino, 1982a), O. pumila (Krombein, 1967), O. cordata Robert son (Rau, 1937; Bitner, 1970), and O. albiventris Cresson (Medler, 1967) all nest in pre-existing holes, use masticated leaf material for partitions and plugs and construct cells in a linear series. Osmia marginata partially lines cells with leaf pulp, as does O. albiventris on occasion. Osmia cordata and O. pumila do not appear to line their nest walls. Osmia marginata and O. pumila form moist pasty provisions, while O. cordata and O. albiventris make provisions that are high in nectar content. Osmia marginata and O. pumila embed the posterior end of the egg in the provision leaving the anterior end free. Details of oviposition in O. cordata and O. albiventris are unknown. Thus, the nesting biologies of Chenosmia and Nothosmia are similar. In contrast, cells in Acanthosmioides are urn-shaped with narrowed entries, and nests are constructed of mud or mud and leaf pulp. Osmia nigrifrons Cresson builds clumps of mud cells on sheltered surfaces, or linear series of cells in tubular burrows (Rust et al., 1974). Leech (1948) and Parker (1975) found nests of O. longula Cresson attached to rocks that had been plastered with mud on the outside. These cells were arranged in clusters, not linear series. Hicks (1926) found a similar nest of O. integra Cresson under a stone in Colorado but did not state whether</page><page sequence="7">VOLUME 56, NUMBER 2 129 leaf material had been incorporated. Rust et al. (1974) stated that both O. nigro barbata Cockerell and O. unca Michener dig shallow burrows in the ground and line their cells with leaf pulp. Cells of Osmia nigrobarbata are constructed in a linear or branched series, while cell configuration in O. unca is apparently un recorded. Osmia nigrifrons and O. nigrobarbata lay eggs with the posterior end attached to the provision; the anterior end is free. Thus, nests of Acanthosmioides have relatively little in common with their proposed nearest relative, Nothosmia. Unfortunately, only one cell from a species of Monilosmia has been described. Parker and Tepedino (1982b) described a cell of O. sculleni Sandhouse that had been constructed from masticated leaf material in an elderberry trap-nest. The limited evidence clearly supports the views of Parker (1975) and G. E. Bohart (pers. comm.) on subgeneric relationships. These observations also lend credence to the contention that evaluation of subgeneric relationships should take into account nest architecture and other aspects of nesting biology (e.g., pollen mass consumption, differences in structure and chemistry of cell linings, glandular secretions used in cell construction, position of the egg on the provision, mechanics of larval eclosi?n and movement). If phylogenetic relationships within the genus are to be understood, it seems logical that it is necessary to consider the behavioral and architectural expressions of evolution. In the final analysis a classification based on a combination of anatomical characters, nest architecture and other biological characteristics will prove to be the most useful.
