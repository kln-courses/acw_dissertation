What is the right way to feel about things? If we scholars ignore the object world, pretend- ing that things are largely irrelevant to a transcendent and disembodied history of ideas, we err on the side of idealism, oblivious to the shaping of intellectual life by materiality. If, on the other hand, we become obsessive about objects, hoarding and treasuring relics of the past, we risk becoming thoughtless antiquarians (or worse, fetishists), preoccupied with the sheer materiality of objects at the expense of the structures of meaning they enabled. Thanks to a range of thing theorists, from Bill Brown and Bruno Latour to Elaine Freed- good and Lynn Festa, literary critics have learned to pay attention to the interdependence of things and cultural meanings: how objects are made, how they are consumed, and how they, in turn, have a share in producing and consuming subjects. We have learned to notice the circulation of things, their range of uses, their role as commodities, their ways of creat- ing linkages and signaling social distinctions. All of this has brought the work of literary critics newly close to the traditional labor of anthropology, which since the nineteenth century has attended to the interrelations of folklore and tool making, legal norms and material practices. But if anthropologists have been doing the work of connecting things to cultural mean- ings, what do literary critics, specifically, have to offer to the study of cultures as complex networks of material and immaterial formations? A skeptic, especially one of a social sci- entific persuasion, might well say: little or nothing. Literary studies should stick to what it has traditionally done best: developing interpretations of written texts, a practice closer to biblical hermeneutics than to anthropology. But these two new books by John Plotz and Peter Melville Logan suggest three crucial ways that literary studies, even in its most tra- ditional guises, demands an attention to the thingness of things. The first is the history of the book, or literary texts as objects; the second is a thematic attention to things, or objects in literature; and the third is the claim that the very discipline of literary criticism develops as a kind of protective reaction against things that could seem too powerful - criticism as a purposeful distancing from objects. Let me begin with the attention to the thingness of books. Literary critics have argued for generations that our interpretive access to texts is mediated by a range of social facts: our intellectual histories, our social identities, our geographical locations. We can under- stand even the New Criticism as part of this tradition if we see it as a pedagogical method directed to the acquisition of analytical reading habits: that is, close reading was all about teaching students specific new ways of mediating their relationship to literature. An atten- tion to the book-as-object can be understood, in this context, as merely an extension of Novel: A Forum on Fiction 44:1 Â© 2011 by Novel, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">108 NOVEL | SPRING 2011 long-standing literary practices of considering means of mediation. It is just that our under- standing of what mediates reading has now reasonably expanded to include such matters as the written text's binding in paper or leather, its cover copy and page layout, its circula- tion to local, regional, national, and transnational audiences, its use in the classroom, its serialization, and its cost. We are now developing the tools to think about the stark dif- ferences between encountering, say, a novel by William Makepeace Thackeray printed in anachronistic eighteenth-century type in an expensive leather binding and coming upon Emily Dickinson's poetry, written on thousands of pieces of paper hand bound together in booklets, stabbed with needles, and packed with punctuation marks unknown to the typesetter. While literary studies has become accustomed to attending to the written text's complex material forms, there is a second way that its traditional practices encourage a focus on objects. Once we have noticed things as a category, it is hard not to be fascinated by the mul- tiple ways that literary texts reflect on the cultural work they do. Literature often meditates on the power of objects, their value, their patterns of meaning. From the well-wrought urn to the golden bowl, even the texts most beloved of formalist criticism took material objects as organizing principles. And the sheer range of ways that literary works present objects offers a fertile ground for analysis. Some written texts actively theorize things, while others cleverly conceal their shaping force. Certain texts clearly prompt readers to attend to the making of objects - from embroidered trimmings to dangerous glass production - while others make a mockery of characters for their excessive attachments to things. Some seem overstuffed, others strangely spare. Some cast objects and subjects as interchangeable - as in Our Mutual Friend - while others bewail the transformation of humans into objects - as in Uncle Tom's Cabin , the original subtitle for which was, as Plotz reminds us, The Man Who Was a Thing. Literature, then, serves as one kind of storehouse for a culture's rich range of relations to its things. In fact, among the exciting innovations of Plotz's Portable Property is that it brings these first two modes of reading together: for him, literature acts as a specific kind of material object that reflects on the cultural activity of material objects, including itself. By seeking to understand "Victorian novels as a series of works about portable property that were also meditations on their own states as pieces of portable property" (xv), Plotz ushers in a particular and productive relationship between the history of the book and fine-grained literary analysis. If Plotz expands traditional methods of literary criticism to consider both literary texts as objects and objects in literature, Logan shows how the very discipline of literary criti- cism develops out of a complex relationship to the perceived power of things. Victorian Fetishism locates a particular structuring principle at the heart of Victorian thinking about objects and their meanings. In the second half of the nineteenth century, a whole host of writers and thinkers were struggling to capture the operations of "culture," a concept that was taking on new disciplinary shape at the same time in Arnoldian criticism and the developing field of anthropology. Surprisingly, Logan argues, both the "high" culture concept we associate with Matthew Arnold as the founder of literary studies and the more anthropological definition of culture as a set of meanings, values, and practices depended on a common logic. This is the logic of the fetish, understood as an object accorded a false power by a worshipper. In order for this logic to function, there must be two subject posi- tions and a single object: the first subject believes in the magical power of the object, while</page><page sequence="3">LEVINE | THING, FEELING, FORM 109 the second acts as the detached and knowing subject who understands that power as a delusional projection. Repeatedly, Victorian cultural theories rested on this distinction between the secular, detached "critic" and the immersed, uncritical "worshipper"; it was as crucial to Arnold's condemnation of the bourgeoisie's blind faith in self-interest as it was to Edward Burnett Tylor's anthropological definition of "primitive" societies. In the process, Logan argues, these critics implicitly fetishized their own values, assuming that these were true and indisputable against the false and superstitious thinking of those they accused of fetishism. Thus he hints that critics may always risk indulging in acts of fetishism, exposing others' values as false and egocentric without recognizing their own as equally arbitrary projections. Together, then, these two books suggest that objects, however often disavowed, discred- ited, and overlooked, have always been at the heart of literary studies. Written texts have always been material objects that mediated our relationship to their contents; literature has always stuffed itself full of interesting objects; and critics have persistently adopted the role of skeptical subjects who resist and reveal delusions about the power of things. There would be no literature without objects - and no literary criticism, either. These two books make one glad that there is such a thing as literary criticism. Both are thoughtful, carefully researched, insightful, and highly original. Both invite a whole set of exciting questions about methodology. And both offer exhilarating new readings of important Vic- torian texts. Plotz begins by exploring the unstable Victorian distinction between irreplaceable objects that carry sentimental value and fungible commodities in the marketplace. Both traveled. Objects that had special and particular meanings - reminding one of home, or of one's nation or religion - could be taken on long journeys as mementos. Commodities, on the other hand, traveled for profit, their value contingent on the fluctuations of world markets. The Victorian novel, Plotz argues, straddles these two categories and worriedly reflects on the capacity of things to move, precisely because of its own liminal status as a carrier of both sentimental and fiscal value. He reads The Mill on the Floss , Cranford, and Margaret Oliphant's Kirsteen (1890) briefly in the introduction to illustrate the Victorian concern with the "double life of property" (12). He reflects productively here, too, on how portable property allows national identities to travel with their bearers, suggesting that cultural value itself emerges by way of processes of circulation. In the subsequent two chapters, Plotz explores narratives that revolve around certain kinds of objects: the first, diamonds - The Eustace Diamonds , The Moonstone , and Christina Rossetti's "Hero" - and the second, those objects cherished by Anglo Indians as signs of their Englishness. Diamonds are a kind of extreme object: on the one hand, they can repre- sent perfect beauty and are often heirlooms or gifts, precious in their specificity and capable of distinguishing their owners; on the other hand, they are quintessential carriers of mon- etary value, the ultimate exemplars of sheer wealth. Plotz makes the intriguing argument that diamonds become "overattached objects" for Anthony Trollope's Lizzie Eustace, too closely associated with her person, and so become an instance "where adhesion interrupts flow" (39). Plotz's chapter on Anglo Indian writers - including Julia Maitland and Emily Eden - is full of fascinating detail. What does it mean not only for English people but for Englishness itself to travel? Plotz makes the case that the effort to maintain connections to home and to national identity - a portable Englishness - often involved a "willful inat- tentiveness" to things Indian, "an active effort to achieve ignorance about India and the</page><page sequence="4">110 NOVEL | SPRING 2011 Indians" (57). Meanwhile, objects such as strawberries signified Englishness only abroad where they did not grow, suggesting that Englishness was as much a product of circulation as of emplacement. In a wonderfully original reading of Daniel Deronda, Plotz goes on to consider the por- tability of culture for a character who both learns his identity and seems to have always already had it. Deronda so fully internalizes his acquired cultural identity that he becomes illegible to those who do not share it; even the narrator retreats in ignorance from giving us access to his internal life. Not quite embracing the hardening category of race, Eliot asks "whether portable culture might be carried far enough inside an individual that it became a kind of bodily, as well as a spiritual, heritage" (94). The chapters that follow focus on Richard Doddridge Blackmore's Lorna Doone and the fiction of Thomas Hardy, novels located in precise and knowable rural places. Both raise questions about the value of "provincial novels," which, like Middlemarch, convey the whole nation through a single locale, and "regional novels," which represent a particular part of the nation in its specificity, fracturing the whole. If "locodescription" depends on "stabil- ity and immobility" (96), the novel, a commodified object of print culture, is intended for circulation. These fictions therefore raise vexed questions about the transmissibility of local customs and the novel's capacity for rootedness, questions about whether the particularity of surroundings can and should be on the move. In Plotz's analysis, Hardy is important for insisting on the minute locatedness of perception, so profoundly shaped by the particulari- ties of social and personal circumstances that it cannot even inhere in a place, and certainly cannot travel in the form of portable property. Plotz closes with a reading of William Mor- ris's romances, which refuse to allow objects to function either as fungible commodities or as carriers of national culture. And he reflects, in the book's conclusion, on the afterlife of portable Englishness, rejected by George Lamming but embraced as an inheritance by such other postcolonial writers as V. S. Naipaul and Derek Walcott. Where Plotz's book ranges widely from diamonds and strawberries to local color novels, and his argument traces many diffuse paths, Logan offers us a tightly argued volume that focuses on the single problem of fetishism in satisfying depth. He gives a careful intel- lectual history of the term, tracing its first use by Portuguese traders to West Africa, but also locating the idea of the fetish in a long tradition of Western thinking about supersti- tion and false belief, reaching as far back as Epicurus, who was interested in explaining why almost all people embraced the mistaken idea of an afterlife. Epicurus and the poet Lucretius located the source of such thinking in earlier times, putting forward the idea that primitive people could not think abstractly and projected their own values and desires onto the natural world in the form of anthropomorphic accounts. Surpassing this stage of "psychological projection" (22), Epicurus's own contemporaries had entered an era of rationalism that could look critically back on these false beliefs. By the nineteenth century, this narrative of development would come to include children, peasants, women, and of course non-European others - all thought to be incapable of abstraction and so inclined to a kind of magical thinking that imputed false power to objects, and all in need of instruction by knowing and abstract thinkers. Logan devotes considerable attention to Auguste Comte, whose influence can be traced to all of the major figures that follow in the book, and whom English speakers have to thank for the popularity of the term fetish. Logan's chapters on Matthew Arnold and George Eliot are both absorbing and surpris- ing. Each deliberately domesticates the concept of the fetish in order to launch a critique of</page><page sequence="5">LEVINE | THING, FEELING, FORM 111 dominant English beliefs, but each text, in the process, "reproduces the fetishistic practice it critiques" (48). It would be difficult to find more important literary figures than Arnold, founder of the discipline of literary studies, and Eliot, representative of the high-water mark of novelistic realism. And since both emerge in Logan's account as structured by their relation to the fetish, we begin to see how the position of the detached "critic" in relation to the absorbed and deluded "worshipper" can continue to structure the work of criti- cism even into our own time. Along the way, Logan offers deeply satisfying and excitingly new readings of these two seminal figures. "[W]hen Arnold transposed Comtek fetishistic stage onto the stage of Victorian life," for example, Logan concludes that "he was no longer describing a residual trait but an essential Victorian condition" (53-54). The fetish is not only an instrument of colonial domination but also a way to develop modes of domestic cultural critique. Similarly, Logan manages to say some startling new things about nov- elistic realism. It is "the dream of the realist author," he writes, to create "an object that comes to life" (85), but at the same time, Eliot, the careful reader and translator of Ludwig Feuerbach, is committed to using the realist novel to reveal religious fetishism as a set of false projected beliefs. Thus the fetish drives a wedge between content and form. "In the novel's content," realism "operates as an antidote to fetishism, while in its formal technique, it exploits fetishism in the service of the realist mimetic effect" (87). The next two chapters, on Tylor's anthropology and the sexology of Richard von Krafft- Ebing and Sigmund Freud, trace careful paths through these texts to show how each uses the structuring principle of the fetish to capture the operations of "culture" in subtly differ- ent ways. Where Tylor used fetishism to describe "primitive culture," Krafft-Ebing domes- ticated the anthropological usage to describe erotic attachments to objects, finding fetish- ism pervasive in erotic life and distinguishing between the fetishist who worshipped an object as an extension of a beloved person and the fetishist who was aroused merely by a detached thing. Freud, most subtly and intriguingly of all, "retains the opposition between critic and worshipper," but he also "combines them within a single psychological subject, who both accepts and rejects belief in the fetish, maintaining two contradictory positions simultaneously" (132). The implications of Logan's argument seem significant indeed, describing as they do a pattern that crosses disciplines and centuries and has structured crucially influential thinking about religion, about colonial others, about representation, sex, and art. In the end, the greatest disappointment of his book is that he himself seems intent on closing down the far-reaching ramifications of his own thinking. That is, Logan explicitly locates the logic of the fetish in the Victorian moment and makes the case that it no longer obtains. Plotz makes a similar historicist move, concluding that the particular conceptualizations of portable property he traces in Victorian culture belong to their own moment and no other. In this, both writers seem overcautious, resisting some of the most significant implications of their fascinating work. Indeed, reading the two texts together prompts a set of questions that feel far from resolved. Both, for example, share an interest in the problem of defining culture, a term that remains elusive now, in a moment when cultural studies has emerged as a central part of our discipline. In these two books, we see how intently Victorian thinkers struggled to define what about culture traveled, whether it could be changed, what was material and what immaterial about it - all concerns that continue to haunt us now. Both also suggest that historicism itself may retain the structure of fetishism: to imply that it is possible to know a Victorian relationship to objects that remains locked in its own moment, distinct</page><page sequence="6">112 NOVEL | SPRING 2011 from our own, seems to replicate the structure of critical distance and immersive involve- ment that describes the Victorian anthropologist. Perhaps contemporary historicism will itself turn out to be a version of Victorian fetishism rather than a detached account of it. Despite these overlapping implications, I would also like to point to what seems to me a crucial difference between these two books: they urge us to have quite different feelings about objects. Take, for example, two things from The Mill on the Floss that appear in both critical works: Mrs. Tulliver's hand-stitched linen collection, which she is forced to part with while her husband lies immobilized upstairs, and Maggie's wooden doll, which she hammers whenever she has been unjustly treated. Plotz reads these two objects as dis- tinguished by the characters7 relationship to portability. Mrs. Tulliver's "primitive attach- ment" to her property is so fixed on the objects themselves and so narrowly focused on their limited reality that it leaves no room for affective attachments of other kinds and prevents us, he argues, from feeling anything but indifference to her fate. Maggie's capacity for fluid and hence sympathetic emotion, by contrast, is signaled by the fact that her doll "is a surprisingly flexible little object," representing "any and all of Maggie's perceived tormentors" (8). Plotz concludes that for Eliot, "a character (or a reader, or an author) who perceives only the physical mobility of a resonant object is missing the metaphorical pos- sibilities inherent in its alienability, its sentimental transferability" (9). We feel sympathy for Maggie but not for her mother, in other words, because Maggie's objects have metaphorical portability, while her mother's are strictly literalized. By contrast, Logan reads these same objects as criticizing the "domestic primitivism of the underdeveloped Tulliver family," as Maggie almost reduces the wooden doll to splin- ters in her rage. Logan writes that the detached narrator looks on, sympathetic but not involved. Later, when Mrs. Tulliver's linens are juxtaposed against Mr. Tulliver's immobile body, Maggie is now the one occupying "the position of antifetishist by taking the stance of the critical observer" instead of the narrator. "She upbraids both her mother and brother for caring more about 'table-cloths and china' than about her invalided father" (76). In two triangulated structures, Eliot gives us one subject absorbed in the power of an inanimate object and another who remains detached and critical. What is at stake in these two readings is at least in part a problem of figuring out how and where to direct our feeling. Whereas Plotz sees Maggie as consistently sympathetic while her mother "deters sympathy," Logan casts the narrator as "compassionate" in descriptions of her two fetishists - first Maggie, then Mrs. Tulliver - but uninvolved. Both agree that Maggie resists sympathizing with her mother as she is about to lose her linens, but they come to no consensus about how we feel, or are supposed to feel, about Eliot's objects. We might say that for Plotz the problem is one of judgment, for Logan one of perspective. That is, where Plotz sees Eliot as favoring the sentimental attachment to objects while decrying the merely materialistic love for them, Logan attends to the process by which one comes to inhabit specific subject positions that are structured according to competing values. Or to put this another way: Plotz aims to reveal Eliot's feelings toward objects; Logan seeks to isolate the structures that make feeling toward objects possible in the first place. It strikes me that these two modes of reading are in keeping with two very different approaches to literary historicism at work today. They involve, implicitly, two distinct ideas about the operations oiform. In recent years, literary critics have been struggling in rich and various ways to combine historicist accounts of power and culture with the tradition of lit- erary formalism. These two books share this struggle but take two notably different tacks.</page><page sequence="7">LEVINE | THING, FEELING, FORM 113 At first glance, Plotz seems like the more formally inclined reader of the two, attending to such literary forms as the quotation - crucial to Emily Eden's capacity to carry her English culture with her while in India - and flat characterization, as William Morris deliberately resists the portability of a discreet, individualized internal life in favor of a generalized equality of condition. But what grounds this version of formalism? It is worth noting that Plotz's literary forms emerge as responses to preexisting social facts that shape or perhaps determine them. Building on the work of Jonathan Crary, for example, Plotz claims that the late nineteenth century saw crucial changes "in notions of perception's relationship to the social world" (127). In a rapidly modernizing and technological economy, a new set of con- cerns developed about an individual's capacity for attentiveness. It was in this context, Por- table Property tells us, that Thomas Hardy developed three formal techniques for exploring this "problem of attention": thus his novelistic multi-perspectivalism, his "tangled syntax" (142), and his deliberate perceptual gaps between word and image act as formal responses to the new problems of knowing a particular material environment. When it comes to the relations between historicism and formalism, then, the social wcirld comes first, and liter- ary forms come after. For Plotz, form is a historical epiphenomenon. On the other hand, Logan's book might seem on first reading to privilege historicism at the expense of formalism. Victorian Fetishism pays comparatively little attention to tradi- tionally literary problems of genre, rhetoric, or style and carefully traces intellectual gene- alogies that link such figures as Lucretius and Giambattista Vico to Comte and Freud. Yet Logan's attentiveness to the structured relations of subjects to objects puts one specific version of form at the very center of his analysis: the same iterable triangular pattern - two subjects in relation to one object - crops up across late Victorian texts, from Arnold's "Empedocles on Etna" to Krafft-Ebing's sexology, from Tylor's anthropology to the work of Freud. Logan calls this a structure. To subsume it into a definition of form means broaden- ing our usual definition of form, bringing together both aesthetic and nonaesthetic objects, and suggesting that literary forms may be more akin to social structures than they are reac- tions to them. I myself feel strongly that we should shift to just such a capacious definition of form that would allow us to make new connections between literary forms and social formations. And Logan shows us how important this could be. It is a fetishistic triangle that structures both an English relationship to "primitive" colonial others and a critique of Englishness as itself fetishistic. It is the same triangle that structures both "normal" and "deviant" sexualities for sexologists, since these depend on assessing the proper relation- ship between a particular object and erotic desire. And it is the same triangle that produces the troubling paradox at the heart of Victorian realist novels, which aim to demystify illu- sion at the same time that they themselves act as illusions. Logan in fact explicitly casts this literary paradox in terms of form: "[W]hile realist literary form relies on illusion, its content seeks to undo illusion" (69). And it is the same triangle, again, that structures the relationship between the text and the scholar, who seeks to demystify ordinary readerly absorption - worship - by adopting the detached position of literary or cultural critic. If for Plotz forms are reactions to a social world, for Logan it is forms that produce and organize that world. Thus these two books make two quite different presumptions about the relations between historicism and formalism: in the first, form is a response to his- tory; in the other, form is one of history's building blocks. All of this brings us back to the question of how we should feel about such objects in literature as those in The Mill on the Floss. We can see how Logan's is ultimately the more formalist reading of the novel: where</page><page sequence="8">114 NOVEL | SPRING 2011 Plotz assumes that we identify with the protagonist's position and therefore share her rela- tions to objects, immersing ourselves in Maggie's experience, Logan proposes that certain structuring principles make it possible not only to feel but also to think about feeling toward objects, a kind of second-order experience that is the analytic position. Thus while I admire both books - both are densely researched, readable, and significant - Logan's slim volume seems to me to get at something more fundamental than Plotz's often brilliant readings. The repeated pattern of the fetish triangle allows us to see both how we might feel about a thing and how we might stand back from that feeling and seek to understand it. That is, it shows us how we come to inhabit the positions of both absorbed reader and detached critic in the first place. Form, in this context, turns out to be absolutely crucial to the task of thinking about things. We have long been accustomed to thinking about form as that which is immate- rial. It would seem, therefore, to have little to offer to the study of material culture. But Logan's book suggests quite a different conclusion. How can we begin to think about how we approach things - how we feel about them, how we represent, study, collect, value, and resist them - without taking into account the repetitive, always potentially transhistorical structuring relationships that bring them to our attention at all? For example: the epistemo- logical or disciplinary structures that prompt us to immerse ourselves in them or to detach ourselves from them, the narrative patterns that set lifeless objects against living subjects, the ritual forms that endow things with power and magic, and the conceptual categories that allow us to see them as things. To take this logic even farther, it might make sense to begin to understand things as forms and forms as things. The panopticon can take shape as a material structure, but it is also an iterable way of organizing experience, an arrangement of space that produces a certain circulation of power. It is both a thing and a form. Similarly, the sheer heft of the triple decker organizes the space and time of our reading in a way that the sonnet does not. Nicholas Dames's new work on the physiology of the novel suggests that Victorian theorists saw the form of the novel not as an abstract structure that had to be unearthed after reading but a lived set of rhythmic experiences, a temporal process that organized physiological experience. The form of the novel, in other words, was perceptible through and as its effect on living bodies; it was nothing if not material. What is most far reaching about the work of both Plotz and Logan, then, is that these books invite us to begin collapsing the distinction between immaterial literature and mate- rial objects in a range of ways that push the discipline of literary studies in exciting new methodological directions while also drawing on traditional modes of reading. How can we think about objects through literature, and literature as objects? How best to bring together the history of the book with close reading? And how might we think in new ways about the relations between material structures and literary forms? There is no question that these thoughtful and thought-provoking books will stimulate such conversations for years to come.
