<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMADIBUS SEVERAL of the treatises and lectures that make up the Hippocratic corpus begin with more or less extended statements about the physical composition and operation of the world at large, and approach the study of human physio- logy from this angle. We see this, for example, in De Natura Hominis, De Flatibus, De Carnibus, De Victu; it was the approach of Alcmaeon of Croton, Diogenes of Apollonia, and according to Plato (Phaedr. 270 c) of Hippocrates himself. The work known as De Hebdomadibus would appear to be a prime example of the type. The first twelve chapters are cosmological. They are dominated by two ideas: that everything in nature is arranged in groups of seven, and that the human body is constructed on the same pattern as the whole world. In the later part of the book (13-52) we pass to the subject of fevers, their causation and treatment. But as Roscher observed, the cosmology and the pathology do not belong together. Not only is the hebdomadic principle ignored in the latter, except in the special theory of critical days (26), which is found in other works of the corpus: it is flagrantly contradicted. Chapters 13-16 contain dualistic analysis of the soul in terms of hot and cold, an equation of bodily and cosmic constituents in terms of a four-element theory, and a division of the year into three seasons. These are all topics that have been dealt with in earlier chapters on the hebdomadic principle. The title TEEpt' jPo0dcLoWV is thus only appropriate to the initial chapters; and Galen in fact only applies it to them. His three references to the 7rEpl AotzduSwVv are to chapters 2, 4, and 6. The pathological part of the book he cites as -r a' rrEpt vo&amp;aoWV r- t?KpdrEpov, and Littr6 and Ilberg have shown the correctness of this appellation.' The extension of the first title to cover both parts is presupposed by the commentary of pseudo-Galen (see below) and by the Latin version that is our most complete source. In what follows I shall disregard it, and treat chapters 1-12 on their own. I assume that they repre- sent the introduction to some other medical disquisition. The sentence in 12 that seems to link it directly with the following discussion of fevers is inter- polated, as the ps.-Galen commentary shows. The work was unknown to the modern world until in 1837 Littr6 published a notice of it based on a very corrupt text of the Latin version from a Paris manuscript.z The text was printed in the eighth volume (1853) of his great edition of the Hippocratica. Shortly afterwards a second, rather better manu- script of the Latin text was discovered, and, better still, a fragment of the Greek text (1-5). These were published in Littre's ninth volume. The three sources were reprinted by the Dutch scholar F. Z. Ermerins in his Hippocratis et aliorum medicorum veterum reliquiae, iii (i864), 533 ff. Ermerins made a serious effort to make sense out of the Greek. His emendations are somewhat violent, but there are excellent corrections among them. Then in 1893 C. Harder drew x Littr6, viii. 623, 629; Ilberg in Gr. Studien H. Lipsius dargebracht, 1894, 33-9. 2 Recherches sur une traduction inidite du traiti des Semaines, livre attribue d Hippocrate dans l'antiquitd, et dont le texte grec est perdu (Paris).</page><page sequence="2">366 M. L. WEST attention to an Arabic manuscript in Munich, which he described as contain- ing a translation of the De Hebd. (to chapter 17) and also a translation of a commentary on it by Galen (Rh. Mus. xlviii [18931, 433-47). His article con- tained what appeared to be a German version of the Arabic De Hebd. It was only in 1914, when H. Bergstrdisser published the complete Arabic text with a literal German translation (Corp. Med. Gr. xi. 2), that it was made clear that the manuscript did not contain a continuous translation of the De Hebd., but only lemmata between sections of the commentary (which Bergstrisser showed could not be by Galen). What Harder had printed was a free reconstruction made up from the lemmata, the commentary, and the Latin version; but he left it so unclear what he was about that it is not surprising that people were misled. While his version must not be treated as a source for the text, it remains useful as a contribution to understanding, for it is to this day almost the only version designed to be comprehensible that has appeared in any language. De Hebd. attracted little general notice until W. H. Roscher came across it in the course of his studies on the number seven in myth, cult, superstition, and philosophy. He became very excited about it, made up his mind that the cosmological part dated from the mid sixth century and was thus the oldest surviving Greek prose, and published a series of lengthy and inexcusably repetitive works in which this view was argued,' as well as an edition which remains an indispensable basis for any study.2 Much interest was aroused at the time. Many scholars were persuaded of the great antiquity of the cosmo- logy, though others, including such authorities as Diels and Boll, insisted that it must be brought down to the fifth or early fourth century.3 Since then there has been less written. The principal study that remains to be named is that by Kranz in his 'Kosmos und Mensch'.4 In embarking upon a new analysis of the cosmology I cannot do otherwise than provide a text and apparatus as a basis for discussion. Roscher's edition will be unavailable to many readers; it could not exploit the ps.-Galen com- mentary to the full; and it does not attempt to be intelligible, but to report the evidence of the sources. I must say something about these sources now. The Greek text of I-5 survives, though partly illegible, on the final page of Paris. gr. 2142. Collations by Ilberg and Kalbfleisch and a photograph are to be found at the end of Roscher's 19 1 monograph. I have checked the col- lations against the photograph as far as I can, and got one or two new readings, e.g. rrTvTwov rpooS' for ,rv-rpoboS in I. 2.

A manuscript destroyed in the Escurial fire of 1671 apparently contained the Greek text or part of it. The Latin translation is thought to have been made in the early sixth century, when other Hippocratic works were translated. In reading it, it is important to remember that it is a translation: phrasing that does not look plausible as Latin often becomes intelligible when turned literally into Greek. Mis- understandings show; for example, we see that the translator took 'OKIM- MEPIOZ in II as one word, and TAYTA in 12 as -ra-ra instead of ravrd. The commentary, though not by Galen himself, comes from that milieu, and reflects a text several centuries older than that of the Latin and the extant Greek. Anyone who concerns himself with the text of De Hebd. must work carefully through Bergstrisser's edition, for the gain is considerable. Although it does not yield a continuous text, and the language does not (like the Latin) allow the structure of the Greek sentences to shine through, it reveals that the Byzantine text is defective in two different ways. It is lacunose-ps.-Galen shows that phrases and whole sentences have been left out; and in several places what appears in ps.-Galen as an interpretation of the text appears in the manuscripts as part of the text, in other words, interpolations have been made from the exegetical tradition. For instance, in I. 2 the Greek text has Kat 'a- 7 rrtvrwv rpovqS (sc. o yc ) - 'o aros- Eoocra, and the corrupt Latin version may represent the same. Roscher blithely claimed this as a connection with 'Thales and his school'. But the phrase is puzzling in terms of the hebdomadist's system. He certainly does not regard the earth as composed of water, but as a distinct body that has water in and on it. The meaning might be that it came from water in the first place, but the writer has otherwise not a word to say about cosmogony. Now ps.-Galen gives as the lemma, 'the earth surrounds the water', and says that it can also be construed as 'the water surrounds the earth' (which fits the system exactly): this implies something like ETorL rrTvirwv rpoqos &amp;S roT 7r TEpfXELV av-r-'v rd t yp4a. Some interpreters, he says, have explained that the earth is made from water. It is this explanation that has intruded in the Greek text. Where the Greek is preserved, I have printed it, and supplemented short lacunae in Greek. Elsewhere I give the Latin version, as well as I can recover it from the two mumbling witnesses, transposed into classical spelling. Where ps.-Galen supplies an addition, I sometimes insert it in Bergstrisser's German or in conjectural Greek. It is to be understood that if I mark a lacuna or inter- polation in the Latin, I mean that the original Greek text had more or less at the place concerned, and not necessarily that the Latin version ever did. The apparatus does not attempt to record every scribal quirk, but the essen- tials. The following sigla are used: A = Ambros. Lat. G io8. P = Paris. Lat. 7027. I = effective consensus of AP. G = ps.-Galen as translated by Bergstrisser. * - alteration by me. Square brackets in the Greek text enclose passages illegible in the manuscript; in the apparatus they are also used for suggested Greek equivalents to Latin or Arabic wording. Braces { } mark conjectural deletions, half-brackets t J words omitted by A or P.</page><page sequence="4">368 M. L. WEST TEXT I Mundi forma sic omnis ornata est eorumque quae insunt singulorum.

The opening paragraph states the principle that the world has seven parts, and so has each thing in it. (Cf.

Oddly inserted in the general statement are some special examples known to medicine, not indeed of seven-part structure but of the significance of the seven-day period: the foetus is fully formed in seven days (cf. Io, and De Carn. I9); diseases pass critical points; the vital heat extinguishes itself, in the body or in the world at large (? cf. on Io). The logic of the paragraph would be improved if we deleted the first sentence. The work would then start with a medical thesis, the universal theory opening up from it. I. 2. The seven strata of the natural world are described. It is primarily the macrocosm that the writer has in view, but note the words (&lt;v&gt;) rrm at the beginning (not the same as Ev 70roS rr7m, which you are free to conjecture). Corresponding strata will presently be found in the human body, and at one point the microcosmic parallel helps the interpretation. The seven strata are called Kod~'ot or 7$Ets or owpat.

Kranz thought that the use of Kda'oos was evidence of an early date (not long after 500), when the usage of the word was not yet fixed (pp. 140 f./I8o f.). He overlooks the fact that all the parallels come from later writers: Arist.

The outermost part is the a"KpLTro, later called 0 'OAv'rrpTosC KdourLo (twice in 2. i) and a"Kpvrov 7rdyos (6. 2), an undivided concretion, cold like the skin. The term 'Olympus' was used for the outermost firmament by Parmenides (B i I. 2), Empedocles (B 44), and Philolaus (A I6), and thus has a Pythagorean flavour (Pfeiffer, p. 34). rdyos is used of the firmament in a doxographer's report of Empedocles A 30 (cf. his KpVUraAAos-, A 54 etc.), and in Et. Magn. I96. 24 from a Homeric allegorizer. The word first occurs as a neuter in [Arist.] Probl. 907a9, and perhaps we should emend to KpLros- in 6. 2 in view of De Victu, I. io irv rr7EPtE*OVra Tdmyov, which is at once the skin and the firmament in a similar macro-microcosmic system. (See below on 6.) The same treatise suggests an explanation of the mysterious 'passage(s) of summer and winter'. In I. io and 23 the body is said to be provided with E4fo3o8 nve'v'parog fvXpoo Kat OEpLLOO, CO Ka auw. Plato's Timaeus brings further clarification (79d): there are two 4o380sot, the pores of the skin and the respiratory tract, by which the entry and exit of cold and warm air is controlled. (The skin acts as a heat- valve in another way too (74c), producing cooling sweat in summer and re- taining the internal heat in winter.) The passages of summer and winter in De Hebd. must be a macrocosmic analogue of this physiological system. (Some- what differently Pfeiffer, p. 31), n. 5.) See also below on chapter 4. The next three levels are those of the stars, sun, and moon-the plain man's</page><page sequence="9">COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMADIBUS 373 threefold division that makes no special provision for the planets; cf. e.g. Parm. B I I; Anaxag. B 12; De Victu, I. 10, 4. 89. 1-2. The order is the usual one. The writer goes out of his way to create ornate phrases here. The descrip- tion of the sun as 'having heat' may seem particularly banal, though the microcosmic parallel (6. 2) gives it its point. Of more interest is the expression used for the stars. a'vraV'yEtav presupposes the theory that the stars shine by reflected or refracted light. This is only attested for Metrodorus of Chios (70 A 9) in pre-Alexandrian times, but reflection-theories for various celestial phenomena-sun, comets, Milky Way-were popular in the second half of the fifth century (Empedocles, Hippocrates of Chios and his pupil Aeschylus, Philolaus). It would be implausible for this reason alone to put De Hebd. any earlier. dvowatv and dpauo- imply that the light from the source is thinned out and rarefied by the stars. 'The finest gleam in nature' is an improbable ex- pression for classical Greek, and I have substituted a comparative, 'a gleam finer than it was by origin'; cf. De Morbo Sacro 16. ocaav OEpjLordrav (a doubtful reading) is ignored by G and 1, is not in accord with the system, and spoils the shape of the phrase: I suggest that it refers to 8lo8ov below. We descend through the sublunary weather region to the various waters over the earth, and the earth itself. The idea that it is warmth in the water that gives it movement is paralleled in Hippon 38 A 3, De Victu, I. 3 and 35. rrdvrwv rpodo's: Eur. Ph. 686 dduvrwov ya rpoo', etc. So in the Timaeus, when Plato passes from the stars to the earth, he calls it rpooov qrJLEE'pav (4ob). On the text of what follows, see above, p. 367. 2. I. The things below the earth are a symmetrical counterpart of those above. The earth rides in mid-air, and those on the other side see our up as down (cf. Philol. B 17 'arT V r 70 v roi LEov wTEvavrTtcW KEoLEVQ TOC Ka7T. roZ ydp ' KaTW rO KarTCcaLTo JTLEpoS Ecr2v WU7TEp d.w..r.a cKal T r a cJaaircws'; W. Burkert, Weisheit u. Wissenschaft, pp. 248 f.), and our right as left (cf. P1. Tim. 43e: right and left are reversed for a man standing on his head). It is not clear that the earth is conceived as spherical. KaL 7TEptL ' 77av r'v yV oTo~S ExEI(v) could be so understood, but as Kranz says (p. 143/I82), it would have been more natural to use the term auatpa or oasapo~E3's. See also C. Kahn, Anaximander, p. 85, who finds an indication of a flat earth in E' 7 r d'pt dXE'ETQt. The earth and the outer firmament are stationary, the other five KdaOULt revolve eternally round the earth, driven by themselves and the immortal gods. In the case of the air and waters we must presumably think of what we would call circulation, but it is surprising to find this treated as similar to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. It looks very much as if the writer is adapting a system in which the things that revolved between the earth and 'Olympus' were the sun, moon, and planets. This seems to be confirmed by the remarkable addition in G, which is much what would be said of the planets with their different speeds but common participation in the daily clockwise revolution. Cf. P1. Rep. 617ab, Tim. 36cd, 38c-39d. In the Republic they are made to revolve by Ananke and the Moirai, in the Timaeus by the creator; in the Epinomis (986b) and Xenocrates (fr. 17) they are gods or the vehicles of gods. They were, after all, the star of Kronos, the star of Zeus, etc. This connects with what is said of the propulsion of the KOdLOL in De Hebd. The fact that the writer does not mention the sun, moon, and planets as an example of a natural heptad has attracted attention and been regarded as setting a</page><page sequence="10">374 M. L. WEST terminus ante quem of c. 425 (cf. Burkert, p. 269 n. 76) ; the planets were known to be five by Philolaus' time (A 16). It seems to me that the hebdomadist may well have lived later, whether or not he was well educated about the planets. His thesis was that the whole universe divides into seven, and he had to include the earth and fixed stars. He ends with a compromise between a system of planetary spheres and a system of elemental spheres such as is probable in Empedocles (cf. Guthrie, Hist. of Gk. Phil. ii. I77; De Carn. 2). The moon, being in the middle station, connects (UvvapdoELt) the other things which live in and traverse each other. The latter part of this curious statement might be more fittingly applied to the constituents of the microcosmic system. It is possible, however, that we have here an echo of older cosmic eschatology. For more than one fifth-century writer (not to mention later ones), the moon marks the boundary between the mortal and immortal worlds (Heraclitus fr. 72b Marcovich, cf. 6od; Alcmaeon 24 A I, cf. I2; Emp. A 62); according to the old Pythagorean ud/3foAov, the sun and moon are the isles of the blest. In my forthcoming book Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient I relate all this- on more elaborate grounds than can be indicated here-to the Indian belief that the souls of the dead go to the moon and are there either turned back to enter another mortal life or allowed to pass on to paradise. Emp. B I15 de- scribes how the exiled god, passing through many mortal bodies, is transferred from aither to sea, sea to earth, earth to sunlight, while Heraclitus had spoken of mortals living in the death of immortals, and vice versa. Here is one complex of ideas that may be relevant to the De Hebd. passage. At the same time the concept of joining is significant. Again it comes in Heraclitus, and thereafter in the Pythagorean line of tradition: Empedocles, Philolaus. (See the index to Diels-Kranz s.vv. aplPkdlov, ap/tovia, avvapjLdrOELv.) In Philolaus it clearly has musical associations, and in the fourth century, if not earlier, we get the identification of the celestial spheres with a musical scale: 'Orpheus' Lyra (Nock, CR xli [1927], 170; xliii [I929], 6o f.); Scythinus, DK 22 C 3. I; P1. Rep. 617b, Tim. 36; 'the Delphians' ap. Plut. qu. conv. 745b (Xenocr. p. 76 Heinze). The scale is a JapEtovta, and it pivots on the middle string, the /zlard. Below it is the j'aadr-q, cf. ' 'OAV'5WTOO9 K61u1os '7iraros gcv (Boll, p. 145), and Xenocr. fr. 18. In the 'Delphian' scheme (adduced by Pfeiffer, p. i1I9) it is the region of the planets that occupies the middle place: zdoE'vv ir-7v [Eraa) UvvEXovU(Cav 4ta Kal Uvv rp~tovaav ~ora ovvcrdv ETC-L rd G7rd O ro EoCloLS Ka' rdL TpyELYta -rot~ o3pavloLs. In the Timaeus the four elements, too, are felt to need holding together, and this is done by the two middle terms in what is regarded as a geometrical progression: in solid constructions 8&amp;0o dE' 1EUdr?7TE Uvvap- d7-rrovutv (32b). 2. 2. The next section pretends to be concerned with the 'stars', or rather celestial signs, that mark the succession of the seasons. As there are seven seasons according to the writer, there must be seven heavenly signs; but he lists eight, arranged in four pairs. I cannot explain how he imagines the dis- crepancy to be justified. It is safe to say that here, at any rate, he does not know what he is talking about. What he has done is to take the four signs that conventionally marked the beginning of seasons, and provide each with a partner by free association. The sun by passing its equinox marks the beginning of spring, the rising of the Pleiades the beginning of summer, that of Arcturus the beginning of autumn, the setting of the Pleiades the beginning of winter</page><page sequence="11">COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMADIBUS 375 (De Victu, 3. 68). The long summer period is bisected by the rising of Sirius: medical theory assigned the more fatal class of fevers to the period between the risings of Sirius and Arcturus (De Hebd. 23). In De Aer. II the following times are specified as critical: the solstices, the equinoxes, the risings of Sirius and Arcturus (the latter practically coincides with the autumn equinox), and the setting of the Pleiades. With the sun the hebdomadist has paired the moon, with Arcturus the Bear that it watches, with the Pleiades the nearby cluster of the Hyades, and with Sirius his master and neighbour Orion. But the moon, which rises at all times of day in every season, and the Bear which does not rise or set at all, are totally unfitted for the service he would have them per- form.I Real season-markers could be said to have an dKoAovO1v 0AA-AhoLUa Ka Evavrtwoary (e.g. the rising of the Pleiades coincides approximately with the setting of Arcturus); but the moon does not follow the sun, nor the Bear Arcturus, nor the Pleiades the Hyades. The writer is trying to blind us with a science in which he is far from learned. What he is trying to say in the last sentence I have no idea, but that may not be his fault. The Arabic translation of the opening of the paragraph, 'the wandering stars of heaven', is at variance with the identifications that follow, but it is symptomatic of the fact that we would naturally expect 'the stars of heaven which are seven in number' to be the sun, moon and planets. (Cf. references in Burkert, p. 289, n. 70.) This may be another hint that a planetary system is being adapted. Boll (p. 143) observed that 'vavirwoaty would suit the planets, with their individual and sometimes retrograde movements. But his attempt to interpret the planets into the paragraph is very forced; it takes him a page to explain it. 3. Another series related to the seven seasons-though the relationship is not set out in detail, and hardly could have been-is constituted by the seven winds, obscurely but persistently connected with breath. They are said to start rrr ? o- 70 oEPLOo, and the list accordingly begins at Apeliotes. East winds are warmer than west, according to Aristotle (Mete. 364a24), because they are under the sun longer. Explanation of winds as arising from the action of heat, solar heat in particular, is common from Anaximander onwards (see O. Gilbert, Die meteorol. Theorien des gr. Altertums, 1907, 511 ff.), and in the Philo- laus-Plato line of tradition we find breath connected with the heat of the body (Philol. A 27, P1. Tim. 79d). From Apeliotes we might have expected the writer to proceed clockwise, from warmer to colder, but he does the opposite. The composition of his list deserves attention. We should beware of the assumption that he has taken a symmetrical eight-point wind table and omitted one (A. Rehm, SBBA 1916 (3), 30 ff.; cf. K. Nielsen, Classica et Mediaevalia vii [1945], 20 ff.). For one thing we know of no such scheme earlier than Aristotle (Mete. 363a2 I ff.); for another, the only known system which would yield precisely this set of names is that of Eratosthenes (Galen in Hp. De Humor. 3. I3, xvi. 4o3 K.; I The Chinese used the Bear's attitude as a guide to the seasons (Ginzel ap. Roscher [1911], p. 77; U. Holmberg, Der Baum des Lebens, p. 6), but the Greeks always use risings and settings. The moon and Bears perhaps occur in connection with a heptad of seasons in Heraclitus fr. I 18 M.

L. WEST Gilbert, p. 549 n. i), for all the rest, whether or not they distinguish Boreas from Aparktias, have Kaikias between these and Apeliotes. It is seldom proposed to bring De Hebd. down to the third century. With the exception of Aparktias, the names given by the hebdomadist are all known to Herodotus, and their stations come in the same order (assuming that Lips in 2. 25 is west of south) : Apeliotes is north of east, 7. i88, cf. 4. 99. Aparktias first appears in Aristotle as an alternative name for Boreas. Both names, therefore, were in current use. The first dated authority to distinguish them is Timosthenes ap. Agathem. 7 (Geogr. min. ii. 473; Gilbert, pp. 548 ff.), in the time of Ptolemy II, and it is noteworthy that he agrees with De Hebd. in placing Boreas east of Aparktias. But no chronological conclusions can safely be drawn. Both sources may reflect a distinction discoverable in actual usage, despite Aristotle. 4. We come to the seasons themselves. The Greeks usually speak of two, three, or four seasons. The writer De Victu, 3. 68, says 'I divide the year into four parts, cELEp ttaAtcrdra LVdKOVflCv o0 oTAAhol, winter, spring, summer, autumn.' This shows awareness of at least one alternative system, and it would be very interesting to know whether he knew this section of De Hebd. and had it in mind. In I. 2 above, summer and winter were mentioned as an opposing pair, and appeared to be parallel to the warm and cold air of our breath. That would imply that they were thought of as states of the atmosphere; and here the Latin version agrees with ps.-Galen in saying that the seven seasons represent parts of the aither (?). 'Aither' seems to be the same as 'aer', as in Empedocles. The meaning that is suggested is that the air is divided into seven parts (we were told that each part of the cosmos has itself seven parts, though there is no systematic argument to this effect), with different properties and different effects on vegetation. They visit us in annual cycle, and they are closely connected with the seven winds; wind is simply air in motion, as was widely understood (Anaximander A 24, De Flat. 3, etc.). The 'passages of summer and winter' perforating the outer firmament may thus be related to the respirationes (Latin) or 'gates' (Arabic) of the seven winds. For the Greek original, obscured by a lacuna in our manuscript, Harder cleverly proposed avda7Tvoca, which would imply orifices of some kind. 5. Human life too has its seven 'seasons', the so-called -ACLK'at. For the paral- lelism of stages of life with seasons of the year cf. Pericles ap. Arist. Rhet. 1365a32 = 14Iia2; 'Pythagoras' ap. D.L. 8. 10, Diod. 10. 9. 5, Ov. M. 15- 199 (Thesleff, Pythagorean Texts, pp. 171, 233). Solon had divided man's life into ten seven-year periods (fr. 19 Diehl). The hebdomadist begins by following his account closely, but is resolved to limit the stages to seven; the later ones therefore have to be extended. The series is given in different forms by dif- ferent sources. Besides Philo, two Latin writers refer to the teaching of 'Hippo- crates' on this subject: Censorinus, De Die Natali 14. 3, and Favonius Eulogius, in Somn Scip. p. 9. 22 Holder (who specifies the libri 17Ept' fPo0d3wov).

Galen, for example, makes the veavlaKKo-period last till 35 (xvii (2). 644, 795 K.; cf. ps.-Galen, p. 59 B.). Evidence from the fifth or fourth century is hard to come by, but De Cam. 13 apparently puts the vETvirKOS' from the third to the fourth or fifth hebdomad, and it may be worth noting that the formula 36-49 (days) appears in the embryology of Empedocles (A 83). 6. In this important chapter the seven parts of the world are related to the parts of the body. This time we start from the middle. According to the first sentence, the parallelism extends to all animals, and trees too, but in what follows only man is considered. The nature of the relationship, if the Latin version may be trusted, is expressed indifferently in terms of similarity, imita- tion (of man by the world!), or identity. The stony interior of the earth corresponds to the bones, the weaker parts surrounding it to the flesh. The terrestrial waters correspond to the liquid parts of man: hot springs to the spinal marrow and semen, that according to widespread belief comes down from the brain (R. B. Onians, Origins of European Thought, pp. Iog ff., 121 ff., al.); rivers to the veins; ponds and marshes to the bowels; seas to the visceral fluids. The air is the breath in the body. The moon is the region of the brain (so G, who interprets as 'the seat of apperception'; the interpretation had intruded into the text from which the Latin version was made. The Greek phrase may have been 0 roT 0'yKEaAov -rod7os-.) This equation is less obvious than the preceding ones. We have seen that the moon connects the mortal and immortal worlds, and has associations with reincarnation theory, and that the brain is the source of the semen. The Indian theory is that souls rising to the moon, if they are not pure enough to pass higher, are turned into rain and eventually (via plants and food) into semen. In Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient I argue that Heraclitus may have held a similar doctrine; and it would explain the equation of moon and brain in our passage. In P1. Tim. 73bc it is the marrow, coming from the brain, that binds the immortal soul to the mortal body, a function comparable to that which the hebdomadist assigns to the moon. The sun, we were told, is notable for heat; it corresponds to heat in the body. But the author is in trouble here. The body's heat is well distributed through the inner parts. There are the stars to be accounted for as well, before we reach the cool outer skin. We are instructed that some of the solar heat is united with the earth: this is the inner heat in man, while the heat in the upper regions of the world, represented by the sun and stars, is the heat near the surface of the body, which glows in consequence of rapid motion and produces visible changes of complexion, 'just as up there you will find ZEbs alyloXos'. Interpretation of Zeus as the sky or aither is common enough from the fifth century on (cf. Burkert, p. 327, n. 72) ; what we have here is an inter- pretation of one of his traditional epithets (apparently applied to the elemental Zeus in Emp. B 142, but perhaps ornamentally). One ancient interpretation of alyloonO was based on the use of a'yls for a squall (so Cornutus, 9 p. 9 Lang; Nonn. D. 2. 420-1I; Eust. in Hom., pp. 6o2. 18, o1017. 37, 1119. 28 ff.), but this loses the connection with the sun and stars. Another explanation recorded in Et. Magn. 27. 34 is that Zeus wore a goatskin, and this might have been built upon in a cosmological allegory: in Apollodorus r. CEWY 244 F 136 Pan is identified with r- wiay, his ruddy face with the aither, and his fawnskin</page><page sequence="14">378 M. L.

Certainly the planet Jupiter has no business here (against Kranz, pp. 125 f./I68 f.). A minor puzzle is how the Arabic version of ps.-Galen has come to turn Zeus into 'the Saturn that is there, that moves and circles'; the commentator says the sun is meant. Saturn in Greek would be QPaltov, or Kpdvov or 'HAlov dcarqp. Perhaps the participle qacvwv appeared somewhere here. The following sentence about the Bear raises further difficulties, textual and exegetical. The Latin copies give arcturius and ero hos; the latter points to arctos (Kranz) rather than arcturus, and ps.-Galen apparently read dpKroL. He makes the sun lead them (whatever that may mean), so it looks as if the last phrase in the Latin, quae e sole nutrita, refers to the feminine arctos; it is the translator's way of dealing with a Greek article, q eirjd 70r8 T ,Alov -o/LEVC) (-rpE-, v.1. re-rpEo- ?), as above we have quae minima et quae magna for -rd 1E ,twKp07ara KaLi 7ra fEycAda or the like. The reference might be to the reflected nature of starlight (I. 2). The Bear or Bears mark the pole about which all the stars revolve. Perhaps the idea is that they supervise the circling of the stars (= the changing colours of the skin), being themselves dependent on the sun (= the heat lower down). American Indians treat the Pole Star as the leader of the other stars, and great importance is attached to it in other places (U. Holmberg, Der Baum des Lebens, pp. 6 f.); cf. Critias 88 F 18-I9. I have considered possible connections with the mention of the Bear in chapter 2, without finding a plausible one. To illustrate the analogies drawn between cosmos and animal we must turn once again to the De Victu and Timaeus, though Kranz has pointed to an earlier parallel, the two fragments of Choerilus which refer to stones as 'earth's bones' and to rivers as 'earth's veins'. Tzetzes' citations do not betray the metre, but a plausible combination with an anonymous quotation in Eustathius supports ascription to the tragedian Choerilus who was apparently about contemporary with Aeschylus (p. 719 Nauck) and not to the epic poet of the late fifth century (p. 271 Kinkel). In De Victu, I. io a systematic scheme is worked out. The parts of the body are formed in imitation of the universe: c7Trotduwki-orv f o Aov, tULKpa rpoS LfEyJaa Kat ~LEydaa a rpol g Kpa (cf. De Hebd. 6 at the beginning). The KOLt L-q - qEylUT7 has the power of the sea. Surrounding it is a formation of which the description is remarkably obscure, but it is an imitation of the earth, and seems to comprehend the flesh generally (cf. 4. 89. I I, 90. 3, 6). In it there are triple circuits (riEplo"oL) of fire which 'abut on each other inside and outside', i.e. they are concentric. Those nearest the fluid reservoir represent the power of the moon, those nearest the containing con- cretion (r~,Jyos) the power of the stars, and those in between, the power of the sun. Further particulars can be added from 4. 89-90, where the system is used as a basis for medical interpretation of dreams. The breath in the body is equated with the air in which cloud, rain, hail, and so on occur (89. 2, I3)- The veins are rivers, the bladder a well (90. 4-5). Despite some differences of detail from the De Hebd., it will be evident that the scheme is closely related to it. All seven of the hebdomadist's world parts are present, and only the moon is given a materially different analogue in the body--one more in accord with its location in the cosmos, but less meaningful functionally. The Timaeus too has this strange idea of the heavenly bodies' rTeplo80L being built into the human body (43a), though they are not the same in number as</page><page sequence="15">COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMADIBUS 379 in the two Hippocratic works, and the rest of the system is not worked out. The cosmic analogy has psychological, not physiological import, and reflects an altogether more abstract line of speculation, but the cruder physiological scheme presumably lies behind it. 7. Next we are offered what appears as an alternative division of man into seven parts according to his outward form. But the heading is misleading. We would expect such a division to give us head, chest, belly, two arms and two legs (so Philo, de opif. mundi, 118, i. 41 C.-W.). What we are actually given is rather a list of seven organs of interaction between the body and its environment: the head, whose various offices will be specified shortly; the hand for action; the U7rAdayXva and bpdvEgs; the penis as the outlet of the urine; the same as the organ of generation; the rectum for the evacuation of solids; the leg for walking about. The second, third, and seventh items would each have been more naturally counted as two, so that it looks as if an original list of ten may have been compressed to make one of seven. The principle of this canon of key points, though not the detail, may be compared with Philo- laus B 13, where the four JpXal of the intelligent creature are specified as the brain, the heart, the navel, and the penis: E'yKEcaAos p&amp;V vdov, Kap8la 8E ovXis Kat altrOcoros, d/WaAg3 PL8wcYLOSg KLo Ka 0v tvauaTo&amp; roT rrpdrov, alsotov 8% o'rr'p- J.aLTOS KaTraflOAs TE caK yvvIUortos. The number ten seems to be of special interest to Philolaus (A 13, I6, B 11), and possibly Archytas if the 7TEpt' T- 8EKK8OS ascribed to him was genuine. 8-9. The idea that each member of a set of seven can itself be divided into seven is here brought back into play. The first of the seven vital organs just listed, the head, has seven functions of its own: inhalation, exhalation, sight, hearing, smell, ingestion, and taste. Respiration is described as the entry of the cold 'through any part that is open' (perhaps a mistranslation, e.g. of ~r7Ep 478 dEqPXECLL), and the exportation of heat from the whole body. Thermal exchange is treated as the essence of breathing by Philolaus (A 27), De Victu (I. IO, 23), and the Timaeus (78-9). For the association of vision particularly with colours cf. Tim. 67c. The sixth entry betrays the common ancient belief that drink goes down the windpipe to the lungs (Alc. 347 (a) I L.-P.; Well- mann on Philistion fr. 7 (Fragmentensammlung d. gr. Arzte, i. I112); Taylor on P1. Tim. 70c). 'And the voice itself has sevenfold articulation'-as if speech had been men- tioned among the offices of the head, as it well might have been. What makes this more suspicious is a similar passage in De Victu, I. 23, where it is remarked that sense-perception takes seven forms: hearing, sight, smell, taste, speech, touch, and OEptzLoo iq vXpovp 7Vrev'EtZro9S d&amp;Eo80oL (OW Ka l "aw. The writer seems to have borrowed the list, if not from De Hebd., from something very like it, and presented it as what it is only in part, a list of the senses. It comes in a series of illustrations of the thesis that the arts and crafts imitate cosmic realities (i. I1-24; cf. Philolaus B I1). The parallel to the transmission of knowledge by seven ways is the art of writing: both admit the formula &amp;L' r-r agrl~yrwv , yvkcrs. In the case of writing the reference is presumed to be to the seven vowels a-qLovw, though it is an odd statement. The De Hebd. may have used a similar expression. Ps.-Galen gives 'the voice is divided into seven parts' or 'is made clear'. The commentary explains that the vowels are meant; as</page><page sequence="16">380 M. L. WEST in other places, the explanation has intruded in the Latin text. In both Hippo- cratic works, then, these seven elements of language are mentioned in close association with the seven functions of the head, or the seven senses. The association is more artificial in De Victu, and the heptadic principle less integral to the plan of the work, so that the version of De Hebd. seems to be either the original or a close relation thereof. The latter alternative rather than the former is suggested by the (evidently secondary) exclusion of the voice from the list of functions. Io. The soul (anima, sc. bvX4) likewise has seven parts, i.e. it is a mixture of seven substances. The first is warmth. The text is uncertain here, but ps.- Galen and the parallel of I. I indicate the sense. Quod in aere et quod in animalibus - r7d E T EV r7 jE'p al Ev 70Lo C oWC, the same idea as seems to lurk in I. I in corpore eorum quae in omne. Perhaps the meaning is that a newborn child is very liable to die within seven days (Arist. Hist. Anim. 588a8), and so is a fire. The second substance is the cool of the air that we breathe in, cf. 8. The third is moisture, distributed throughout the body, cf. the several fluids specified in 6. I. The fourth is earthy; the Latin text identifies it as the blood (= the interpretation of ps.-Galen), and this may be right. In 6. I the blood was counted with the fluids, and it was the bones and the flesh that corresponded to earth, but the present account is of the soul, and although the soul is being conceived materialistically, it is unlikely to include bones and flesh. The writer wants to find an earthy element in it for the sake of his scheme, and blood may have been the thickest and earthiest of the parts that he would regard as belonging to the soul. (It is a quarter earth, according to Empedocles B 98.) We would certainly expect it to appear in his list. The detail that it is the earthy element that needs food may suit the blood, cf. P1. Tim. 8ode, 82c. The fifth ingredient is bitter bile, the sixth sweet nourishment, the seventh 'r ?AvUpdv. Health depends on the proper balance of these seven, which a man can maintain by good regimen. The Presocratics often gave a materialistic account of the soul, though mostly in terms of a single substance, fire or air. D.L. 9. 29 ascribes to Zeno the doc- trine that the soul consists of hot, cold, wet, and dry in balanced proportions. This is followed by an apophthegm elsewhere attributed to Empedocles, and perhaps the paragraph as a whole should be referred to Empedocles; the recipe for soul corresponds with Empedocles' recipe for blood (B 98), which was the seat of consciousness (B 105), and although he cannot have equated the soul with the blood, Aristotelian interpretation seems to have made him do so (A 78, B Io9). Macrobius' statement that Xenophanes derived the soul from earth and water (A 50) is a perversion of B 33, and his statement that Parmenides derived it from earth and fire (A 45) is equally unreliable (cf. B 8. 53 ff. +B 16 +Aet. 4. 5. 12 (A 45)). The De Victu says that the soul con- tains a mixture of fire and water (I. 7). The hebdomadist makes it a compound of bodily powers or opposites of the kind that medical theory had assumed at least from the early fifth century (Alcmaeon B 4; De Morbo Sacro 17, 21; De Nat. Horn. 2-3; Philolaus A 27; De Vet. Med. I4-1I6, 22, 24; Philistion fr. 4, etc.; cf. Kahn, Anaximander, pp. 126 f.). He starts with the famous tetrad hot, cold, wet, dry, which show signs of equation with fire, air, water, and earth- an equation first found in this simple form in Philistion 1.c. To make a heptad he adds bitter, sweet and salty. Bitter and sweet are the opposites most com-</page><page sequence="17">COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMADIBUS 381 monly mentioned, after hot-cold and wet-dry; the report of Alcmaeon speaks of Typoi, qpo0, bvXpo-, OEptpov, 7LKpoi-, ycAVK'OS. Kal Twv AoLr7iv. But these too, at least the bitter and the sweet, are identified with particular things. We may note the doctrine of Tim. 74c that the flesh is compounded from water, fire, earth, and a V'ptwoLa E' dos Ka'L GApvpo3. I 1. It is now the turn of the earth's surface to be divided into seven, and to complicate things, the seven parts are to correspond with parts of the body. It was on this chapter above all that Roscher based his sixth-century dating. That period, he maintained, was indicated by the omission of the Asiatic kingdoms and the whole of the west from what he persistently called the 'world map', and by the designation of Ionia as the pE'VEs of the earth, and of the Peloponnese as the habitat of great souls. He even argued that the Isthmus as the neck of the earth was peculiarly appropriate to the prosperity of Corinth under Periander. Extraordinary to relate, it was left to Boll to point out that the equivalences take their starting point from the physical shape of Greece. In discussing the chapter we must ask firstly on what principle man is here divided up, secondly on what basis countries have been chosen to corre- spond with his different parts, and thirdly what is the status of the remarks about their inhabitants. The seven parts of man are here head, neck and spine, viscera and praecordia, legs, feet, belly, and rectum. The list differs from that in 7, there are remark- able omissions (arms; the whole casing of the trunk), and the last two items are out of order. The identification of head and neck with Peloponnese and Isthmus is given by geography. Roscher quoted examples from Herodotus onwards of avx3qv being applied to a neck of land. Conversely, Tim. 69e de- scribes the neck as an lreOtS KaUl pos 7po r E KE~acLS~ Kal i-oi aur'oovU. Z'aOpLov 'necklace' occurs in the Odyssey. Now, where will the viscera et praecordia be? Remembering from 6. I that they are full of liquid, which corresponds to the sea, we shall not be upset to find them identified with Ionia, provided we in- clude the islands under that name. (Then presumably Attica too, as in Solon 4. 2 D. ; H. Philipp, Woch. f. kl. Phil. xxx [19 13], 667.) The Thessalian-Thracian coast will delimit the man's body on one side. His legs are the Hellespont; they must surely extend along the sides of the Propontis, not just the straits at its entrance. The name Hellespont is so used by Herodotus and in the Athenian tribute lists. The feet are then at the Bosporus, where the coast turns outwards on each side. 'Thracian and Cimmerian' is an absurd gloss, appear- ing in G as 'either the Thracian or the Cimmerian' (sc. q'ro~... ) .. .). So far, so good. But the two parts of the body that are out of place in the series are assigned to quite preposterous localities, right outside the area covered by the rest of the man. They must have been added by someone who did not understand the geographical basis of the original scheme at all. (R. Ganszyniec, Eos xxxv [I934], 116.) If the hebdomadist is responsible, the map-man's origin must be sought in some older source. In the Latin text the inhabitants of the Peloponnese are characterized in a way appropriate to their dwelling in the head. In ps.-Galen there appear corresponding remarks about the inhabitants of Ionia, the Bosporus, and the Euxine, and notes about the Hellespont, Egypt, and the Crimea (?) as places. It is not quite certain that these are all excerpts from the text of De Hebd. rather than part of the commentary, but it looks as though this chapter suf-</page><page sequence="18">382 M. L. WEST fered some abridgment before the Latin version was made. Originally there may have been something like a systematic relation of each region or its people to the part of the body supposed to be represented by it. The 'great souls' of the Peloponnese may suggest either the kings of the Bronze Age who con- tinued to be venerated as heroes, Agamemnon, Menelaus and the rest, or the 'Laconomania' of the late fifth and early fourth centuries. The connection of head with soul is primitive; cf. e.g. the variant KEt8aA/bc8lvXcL IE. I. 3, I I. 55, and Onians, Origins of European Thought, pp. 95 ff. The seat of intelligence is located in the breast, as we see from the annotation on the Ionians (to which it is rash to try and set a date). The feet appear as organs of aggression (cf. Archil. fr. 49 Tarditi 7rdTO'S c8 KEtL rq7L'7)rarot, or the apophthegm of Aristotle quoted with it by Plut. De Garrul. 503a). The equation of 'Egypt and the Egyptian sea' with the belly is justified with a reference to the fertility of the Nile-land. One might have expected rather the people to be called greedy good-for-nothings (yaair-pGs) ; they had a reputation for iravovpyta (see Gow on Theoc. 15. 48), and it would not have been difficult to relate them to the belly. The last of the seven regions is called Euxinus Pontus et palus Maeotis in the Latin, and a sea suits the venter inferior (= -q Kc7TW KOLAC'V); ps.-Galen, however, speaks of a great island--most likely the Crimean peninsula- which collects the refuse of earth and sea, and whose people are weak and servile. We think of the description of the Scythians in De Aer. 18-22, except that Maeotis is the very district where a much more warlike tribe is found (ibid. 17). 12. Concluding the cosmological part of his work, the writer claims to have expounded the nature of the universe and of man. It is such that all creatures' ailments are necessarily parallel to those of the world as a whole, as will be shown in due course. The cosmology is necessary for the understanding of what follows. A full exposition would call for a physical treatise (ratio naturalis %= cvKO~TK AdyoS), but the present account explains the natural structure of things, in the light of which everything must be considered. THE COMPOSITION OF THE WHOLE 'Die ersten elf Kapitel sind ein Ganzes (vom Schlusskapitel abgesehen), aus einem Guss und ganz folgerichtig aufgebaut' (Kranz, p. 137/177). This is by no means my impression. I see a sharp contrast between two strata of composition. On the one hand there are chapters I. I-2. I, 6, 10, 12, forming a coherent and systematic whole. I. I, the world has seven parts, and so has its members. I. 2, account of the seven parts of the world, ending with earth. 2. I, the interrelation and movement of the parts. 6, the corresponding seven bodily parts in earth's creatures. (In terra seems to connect with 1-2.) Io, the seven parts of the soul, on which health and sickness depend. 12, we shall find the parallelism of man and the world operating in disease too. Interrupting this argument, in chapters 2. 2-5, 7-9 , I I, we have a ragbag of further heptads, none of them related to the conception of man as an integrated whole. An ordering principle can be seen: the section on seasonal stars is tagged on to the account of cosmic revolutions, and the winds, seasons and ages follow in a natural enough sequence, though there is then a complete break between 5 and 6. 7 competes awkwardly with 6, but 8 and g develop well</page><page sequence="19">COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMADIBUS 383 enough from 7. Then another break between 9 and I o, while II is quite isolated. All these parts except 9 may be said to have potential medical relevance. The doctor is elsewhere taught to pay attention to the seasons and the stars that mark them (De Aer. 1-2, Io-I I ; De Nat. Hom. 7-8; De Hebd. 16, 23; De Humor. 13-19; De Victu, I. 2, 32, 3. 68; Aphor. 3. 1-23), to the winds (De Aer. 3-6; De Morbo Sacro I6; De Humor. 14; De Victu, 2. 38), to the ages of life (De Humor. I6; De Victu, I. 2, 32-3; Aphor. 3. 24-31), to geographical factors (De Aer. passim, with application to particular countries in 12-24; De Humor. I2; De Victu, I. 2, 2. 37-8). But the hebdomadist's interest in these topics seems to be more mystical than practical. Chapters I+6+ Io+ 12 are capable of development into a theory of diagnosis and therapy, however mistaken; it is hard to see how the rest could have been. I infer that they have a different origin. Now the writer of De Victu is acquainted with a system closely resembling that of 1-2, 6 (though he has nothing to say of its heptadic character), and also with a scheme similar to that in 8-9 but free from an anomaly which is a feature of the relationship of 9 to 8. The commentary has shown up other such anomalies at the very beginning; in the inapposite heading of 7; and in the last two items of the list in I I. These all come in the short, miscellaneous sections, and two of them (7, 11) are connected with the adaptation of older, non-heptadic series. We may say, then, that these sections collectively, in their present form, reflect a later stage of development than what is presupposed in the De Victu. What the author of that work knew was not our De Hebd., but some of the material from which it has been put together. What we have before us is a compilation, in which several ingredients may be distinguished in the light of the above observations. (a) A well-worked-out macro-microcosmic system, expounded in an artistic variety of prose (1-2. I, 6, 10, 12). (b) Heptadic catalogues current before De Victu: the functions of the head (8), the vowels (9); perhaps others. (c) Non-heptadic catalogues adapted by the last compiler: the key points of the body (7), the equation of bodily members with parts of the earth (i I) ; perhaps others. (The seven seasons are built up from the customary tetrad, the seven ages of life reduced from Solon's decad, but we cannot tell whether this is due to the compiler or had been done before him.) The compiler's procedure has been to take the nucleus (a), and augment it with the more random collection of heptads, for the sake of illustrating the cosmic significance of seven as fully as possible. What has happened in I. I is not clear, but here too we may see his interfering hand. DATING It follows that there can be no simple answer to the question 'what is the date of De Hebd. ?' We must ask how old each of its constituent parts is, and when they were put together in their present form. Let us take first the rather grand system that forms the nucleus. It is im- mediately obvious to what line of cosmological speculation it must be assigned: the line that runs from Empedocles to Philolaus and Plato, and may for convenience be dubbed Pythagorean, provided we do not attempt to trace it back to the earlier part of the fifth century. (Parmenides' system is notoriously</page><page sequence="20">384 M. L. WEST obscure.) What appears in De Hebd. is apparently modelled on an astronomically more sophisticated scheme which included the individual planets (see on 2). We must not attribute this reworking to the compiler, for it is presupposed in the physiology of chapter 6, and in the De Victu. No such planetary scheme, and no knowledge that there are five planets, can be traced earlier than Philolaus (A i6). It is noteworthy that he too is at pains to fit his cosmology to a magic number, ten. A striking feature of his system that De Hebd. does not share is the displacement of the earth from the centre and the assumption of an Antichthon. His central fire is not counted among the ten, which are: Antichthon, earth, moon, sun, five planets, Olympus. The system behind De Hebd. could in principle be earlier. But the idea of reflected starlight is against raising the date by much. The assumption of a lower half of the universe symmetrical and opposite to the visible upper part, and the way this is expressed, again has its closest parallel in Philolaus. This bivalve picture is not as sophis- ticated as the spherical earth, needing no support from air, which first appears in Plato's Phaedo and was soon widely accepted. We should beware of assuming that our cosmologist was necessarily abreast of the latest speculation, but his scheme looks remarkably like a product of the latter part of the fifth century. A linguistic detail that perhaps suggests the fifth rather than the fourth century for this section is the concrete use of a noun in -rLS (ir-v crrpwv Cudvowcwv), for the suffix was rapidly becoming specialized in application to processes; see R. Browning, Phil. cii (1958), 60 ff. The heptadistic remodelling was undertaken by someone to whom planets were newfangled nonsense: sun, moon, and stars made a good enough division for him. His interests were medical, and he was concerned with the macrocosm primarily as a parallel to the structure of the human body. It would have been difficult to find analogues for five planets at different levels as well as sun, moon, and stars. Besides, seven was his appointed number. (Belief in the power of seven in connection with critical days must already have been estab- lished in his field; cf. the series in Progn. 20, Epid. I. 26, De Carn. 19, De Hebd. 26; Roscher, 'Hebdomadenlehre', 60 ff.) As to when he operated, we can say with confidence that it was before the writing of the De Victu. Kirk, Heraclitus, pp. 26-9, shows that no date for this work earlier than the mid fourth century is likely. I would add that I. 18 pippovl'rs avvr7aLE EK rT v aTv oX a arTal, CK TV l E0K T c' t c ogTaE 7 LCTIra 8ctaoopa p"AALtIra oV"'1EL KiA. echoes Heraclitus fr. 27 M. (B 51) as interpreted by P1. Symp. I87ab, and that 2. 38. 3 presupposes a spherical earth divided into polar, temperate, and tropical zones, a doctrine not reliably attested before Eudoxus fr. 288-9 Las- serre and Arist. Mete. 362b. A terminus ante quem may be drawn from an ap- parent criticism of the work by Diocles, whom Jaeger put in the later fourth century, but a more recent researcher has put back up to the middle of the century (F. Kudlien, Arch. f. Gesch. d. Medizin xlvii [19631], 456-64). We shall not go far wrong if we assign De Victu to the same period. The author of the macro-microcosmic system of De Hebd., then, might be put anywhere in the first half of the century. The only other clue that I can see is the coincidence with Philistion noted on chapter Io. Philistion was old enough to teach Eudoxus, and may have been approximately Plato's contemporary. I see little prospect of dating the various heptadic and other catalogues that the compiler has used, except that the pair in 8-9 were formulated, and associated with each other, before the De Victu. If anyone wishes to date 3 (the</page><page sequence="21">COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMADIBUS 385 winds) to the third century on the basis of the facts mentioned in the com- mentary on that section, he may, though it does not seem necessary. The list in 7 was in two ways reminiscent of Philolaus. As for I I, the reference of the names 'Iovtl and 'EAA irov-ros suggests a date not later than the fifth century for the original. The terminus ante quem for the compiler is Philo, since Roscher's claims to find earlier references to the work are far-fetched. But Philo knew it as a work of the wise Hippocrates, and it must have borne his name in the Alexandrian library. It is natural to suppose that the compiler was not far removed in space or time from the author of De Victu, where some of the things that he combines appear separately. We see from Aristotle, Metaph. Io93ai 3-16, that people had been collecting heptads more indiscriminately by his time. He mentions the seven vowels, the notes of the scale, the Pleiades, the loss of first teeth in the seventh year, and the Seven against Thebes. Two of these items appear in the De Hebd., but not only there, and there is no reason to think that Aristotle knows this particular work. Nor can anything be inferred from its omission of his other items, any more than from its omission of the Seven Sages (P1. Prot. 343a), the Seven Great Islands (Alexis fr. 268, Timaeus 566 F 65), or countless other possible sevens. They have not the association with medical philosophy that it was possible to find in all the sets that are present. RELATION TO NON-GREEK SPECULATION In 1923, A. G6tze published a remarkable article entitled 'Persische Weisheit in griechischem Gewande' (Zeitschr. f. Indologie u. Iranistik, ii. 60 ff., 167 ff.). In it he pointed out some striking parallels between the 6th chapter of De Hebd. and the 28th of the Greater BundahiSn, a Zoroastrian cosmological work of the ninth century A.D. The latter is certainly based on an older Persian source; G6tze argued that it was directly used by the writer of De Hebd. He described the Hippocratic work as 'an erratic block in Hellas'. I will conclude my study with a brief discussion of its relationship to the Bundahi?n and to other non-Greek material. We have seen that in general, far from being an erratic block, it is put together from parts that very obviously belong in a known tradition of specula- tion, the Pythagorean or western tradition. Preoccupation with number is itself a characteristic of that tradition. As for the number seven, there is no period at which its significance in Greece cannot be illustrated, as the peruser of Roscher's 'Hebdomadenlehre' will see. But it is in Pythagoreanism that it is first consciously formulated. Philolaus B 20 hails the seven as divine leader and ruler of all, eternal, stable, unmoving, like itself and different from others. In the fourth century heptadism was on the increase, as we see from Aristotle, and in later centuries it becomes ever more elaborate. In approaching the question of non-Greek material, then, we should not think in terms of any direct influence upon the work before us, but at most of the absorption of such material into a certain current of Greek thought at an earlier period. We have seen that the macro-microcosmic comparison, with which G6tze is occupied, is hinted at in the first half of the fifth century--only in a couple of poetic kennings, but enough of the idea is present for the de- veloped system of De Victu and De Hebd. to be explicable without postulating any further model. But at this point we had better distinguish between dif- ferent kinds of parallelism between world and man. 4599.2 C C</page><page sequence="22">386 M. L. WEST I. The world may be represented as the body of a god. His head is sought at the top of the universe, the sun and moon are his eyes, the earth and sea correspond to his lower parts, or he may extend to a region below the earth. This type is particularly well established in Indian literature from the earliest times; see R. Reitzenstein and H. H. Schaeder, Studien zum antiken Synkretismus, Stud. d. Bibl. Warburg vii (1926), 69-103; A. Olerud, L'Idie de Macrocosmos et de Microcosmos dans le Time'e de Platon, Diss. Uppsala, 1951, 128 ff. There are traces of it in Iran (J. Duchesne-Guillemin, RE Supp. ix. 1585) and per- haps Mesopotamia (T. Jacobsen in H. Frankfort et al., Before Philosophy, 145 f.). In Greek I may refer to the Pythagorean aphorisms 'the Bears are the hands of Rhea' and 'the sea is the tear of Kronos' (though no single god is here coextensive with the universe); to Aeschylus' ZEV'5 'rtv al4p, ZE1V 5 7'., ZE1S 8' o0pavos, ZEV'sd ro~ r 7Tdvra Xcr rtcov3' rdEprpEpov (fr. 105 Mette); and to the cosmic deity whose human shape is explicitly denied by Xenophanes (B 24, 26) and Empedocles (B 27-3I, 35. II ff., 134). For the Stoics, the world is still identifiable with Zeus (SVF ii. 169. 32, iii. 217. 9), and in Orph. fr. I68. 6-30 we have a full description relating the parts of the world to the members of an anthropomorphic Zeus (who has horns and wings, implying Hellenistic syncretism). 2. The traditional personification of the earth may be elaborated. In Phere- cydes the visible surface of the earth is the robe of Chthonie, and the Peplos of the fifth-century Pythagorean poet Brontinus may have developed this further (cf. Epigenes in Orph. fr. 33). Choerilus properly belongs under this heading, as he talks of the bones and veins of earth, not of the universe. 3. The parts of the universe may be treated as having a likeness with the several parts of man, without regard to their relative position. So in the Greater Bundahiin, despite a series of agreements with De Hebd. Man is a copy of the world. His flesh is as the earth, his bones like the mountains, his veins like the rivers, his blood like the water of the sea, his belly like the sea, his breath like the wind, his marrow like metal, his rectum like the hell under the earth; this is all in order. But his back is like the sky, his hair like vegetation, his fingers and toes like the planets and signs of the zodiac, his intestines like the clouds and Vdzist fire, his eyes like the sun and moon, his teeth like the stars. Once you start such a list, many equivalences suggest themselves, and it may be doubted whether the agreements with De Hebd. really call for the assumption of a common source containing all the same details. In 2 Enoch 30. 8 (ii. 448 Charles) God creates Adam's flesh from earth, his blood from the dew, his eyes from the sun, his bones from stone, his intelligence from the swiftness of angels and from cloud, his veins and hair from the grass, his soul from his own breath and the wind. The myth had a long career in the Middle Ages, and survives in folklore today; cf. R. K6hler, Kl. Schr. ii (i900), 1-7; M. F6rster, Arch. f. Religionsw. xi (19o8), 477-529; Boll, Aus der Offenbarung Johannis (Stoicheia, i), 1914, 62 f. 4. The whole universe may be treated as an organism with working parts similarly arranged as in man. This is the most sophisticated type. It is best illustrated by the De Victu; the system of De Hebd. is an almost perfect example, but the moon-brain equation shows an element of type 3. The sequence moon-sun-stars-crust, by the way, is quite different from the standard Persian arrangement, stars-moon-sun-Beginningless Light.</page><page sequence="23">COSMOLOGY OF 'HIPPOCRATES', DE HEBDOMIADIBUS 387 The basic idea of a parallelism between the world and the human form, type I, may well have come to Greece from the east, in the sixth century. After that, however, independent development seems sufficient to account for the phenomena. In connection with De Hebd. I I, Boll and Philipp independently compared a passage of the Kore Kosmou, one of the Hermetic treatises of which substantial excerpts are preserved by Stobaeus. It is fr. 24. 11 ff. (iv. 55-7 Nock-Festu- giere), where Isis tells Horus that the earth is like a man lying on his back with his head to the south. His heart is where Egypt is, at the centre, and for this reason the Egyptians are -7rvrtwv VOEpWrTEpOL Kal ad opovEs. Those to the south have good heads and hair; those to the east, where the right hand is, are warlike, Sagittarians; those to the west are left-hand fighters, good in defence; those in the north have good feet and legs; while those in front of them, round Italy and Greece, have such attractive thighs and bottoms that they are drawn to homosexuality. As in De Hebd., national characteristics are related to parts of the map-man's body. No other such parallel has been adduced from else- where. The Hermetica are more Greek than Egyptian, and one cannot assume that something is Egyptian just because it comes in the Kore Kosmou. But the idea that the earth is a male figure lying on his back is genuinely Egyptian: Geb the earth-god lies on his back, with Nut the sky-goddess arched over him. Isis says that the earth E'LdPAEEL ovpavcp KaOlrEp rTarpl /I1p, ' o7ws o TaLS' EKELVOV tLE-raofoAas Kat aVTia7 Tr L' - a aVLEaErap~cL nA: the earth has no father in ordinary Greek tradition, but according to Heliopolitan theology Geb has a father, namely Shu, the air or wind that divides him from Nut. Nothing could be more natural than the assignation of different lands to the limbs of Geb. Gaia is personified in Greece, of course, and she has her navel at Delphi, but we do not find pictures of her as a supine figure; the Greeks did not imagine her in such literal anthropomorphic terms. The evidence is not sufficient for us to assert that the map-man must have originated in Egypt, before De Hebd., and come to Greece from there, but it is certainly a possibility. Lastly, the heptadism itself. Number superstition is primitive and wide- spread. Much interesting material on this subject is referred to by Burkert, pp. 441 ff. In Greece it was the Pythagoreans in the fifth century who raised whatever was there before to philosophic status. In particular, the idea that a certain number is to be found throughout the universe appears. 'Every thing is three things, neither more nor less. Each thing's quality is a trinity: aw5VECU, Kpdros, rvx-7' (Ion of Chios B I). Did this way of looking at things come from abroad? In the Brhaddranzyaka Upanishad, which it is thought cannot be later than 600 B.C., we read, 'This universe is a triad-name, form and work' (I. 6. I, trans. Zaehner), as it were Eds o EKarov apEr rpLdcS, ovo/la Kal E8o0s Kal 'pyov. Not much later, in the TaittirDya Upanishad, we find a passage conceived in disturbingly similar spirit to the De Hebd.: Earth, atmosphere, sky, the points of the compass, the intermediate points. Fire, wind, sun, moon, constellations. Water, plants, trees, space, the Self. So much for the material world; now we come to the self:-In-breath, out-breath, diffused breath, upper breath, concentrated breath. Sight, hearing, mind, speech, touch.</page><page sequence="24">388 M. L. WEST Skin, flesh, muscle, bone, marrow. After breaking it down into these categories an ancient seer remarked: 'Surely the universe is of fives. By the fivefold one preserves the fivefold.' (I. 7.) There is much in the Upanishads for which I insist on a historical con- nection with some of the teachings of Greek philosophers in the late sixth and early fifth centuries, and this number speculation fits so well into the overall picture that it is natural to find a connection here too. This does not neces- sarily mean attributing the common pattern of the Taittirfya Upanishad and the De Hebd. to an archetype. Once speculation had been given an impetus in this direction, it might develop on parallel lines in different countries. University College, Oxford M. L. WEST</page></plain_text>
