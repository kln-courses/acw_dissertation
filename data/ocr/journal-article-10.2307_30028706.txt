<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Special Morphological Characteristics of the White Mountain Dialect of Apachean PHILIPJ. GREENFELD San Diego State University Abstract. Morphological differences between White Mountain Apache and the other Apachean languages include both divergences in the phonological shape of morphemes due to regular sound change and the existence of mor- phemes unique to White Mountain Apache. This article briefly reviews some lexical differences between White Mountain Apache and Navajo and then examines differences in stem form, clitics, conjunctions, interrogatives, inde- pendent pronouns, and prefixes. The primary focus of the comparison is Navajo, but some attention is paid to other Apachean and Northern Athabaskan lan- guages. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of Apachean dia- lects as ethnic boundary markers. 1. Introduction. This article may be considered a continuation of a study I published some years ago (Greenfeld 1978) on the special phonological charac- teristics of White Mountain Apache (WMA). Here, I extend that characterization to identify some features of White Mountain Apache morphology that serve to distinguish it from the other Apachean languages, especially Navajo. I use Navajo as the primary comparison because it is the Apachean language that has the largest number of speakers and that has been the most extensively de- scribed. Where data are available or I am familiar with relevant comparisons, I also mention Mescalero-Chiricahua and Jicarilla. 1.1. Comparative work in Western Apache. Faith Hill (1963) has already pointed out some differences between White Mountain Apache and San Carlos Apache, two slightly different dialects of Western Apache. Her comparison shows the differences between these two dialects, but also demonstrates how minor these differences are. Because of the great similarity of these dialects, many of the features I discuss are also found in San Carlos Apache. On the other hand, since linguistic differences are an important ethnic boundary marker for these groups, I do not intend to imply that all of these White Mountain Apache features necessarily occur in to San Carlos Apache. 1.2. Other Apachean comparisons. It would be inappropriate to discuss comparative Apachean without taking note of Harry Hoijer's masterly work on the Apachean verb (1945b; 1945c; 1946a; 1946b; 1948a; 1949), as well as on 356</page><page sequence="2">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 357 Apachean nouns (1948b). Hoijer takes his Western Apache data from San Carlos and focuses on structural parallels in verb form. Hoijer also has documented the similarity in lexicon between Navajo and the other Apachean languages in his glottochronological study (1956). He did not include White Mountain Apache data in that comparison, but notes that 89 out of 100 core vocabulary items are cognate between Navajo and San Carlos Apache (Hoijer 1956:226). Whereas Hoijer was interested in similarity, how- ever, we are interested in difference. Young also makes some morphological comparisons between the Apachean languages, but comments, "The study of comparative Athapaskan morphology is not yet far enough advanced for it to be possible to give a comprehensive survey of the distinct morphological innovations of Apachean" (1983:297). I hope that the present article, though not exhaustive, is one further step toward that comprehensive survey. I wish to outline in fairly broad strokes some of the differentiating features of White Mountain Apache morphology that should aid in comparative studies within both Apachean and Athabaskan. Some of the characteristics I describe are obviously the result of regular sound change and can be stated as sound correspondences. Others appear to be morphological innovations of either one language or the other. Before I begin the discussion of morphology, however, I will comment on some lexical differences that illustrate just how different Navajo and White Mountain Apache can be. 2. Lexical differences. What speakers of the two languages call their languages immediately presents a lexical difference. Navajos refer to their language as dine bizaad 'Navajo their-speech', while White Mountain Apache and San Carlos both call their language ndee biyaatih 'Apache their-talk'. Navajo forms the label on the basis of the noun stem -zaad 'word, speech, lan- guage', and the other languages on the basis of the verb stem -tih 'speak, talk'. 2.1. Color terms. In color terms, White Mountain Apache has replaced the fairly standard Apachean form for 'black', -zhin, with the more generic stem for 'dark', -hit.1 Thus, while the Navajo basic term is lizhin,2 the White Mountain Apache3 form is dithil. This innovation has probably taken place within the last one hundred years, as the stem -zhin is still used in frozen forms in White Mountain Apache such as ba'eshzhine 'black stone' (something used by medi- cine men), and was recorded by Goddard to refer to the head mountain spirit dancer gaan 'itzhine (Goddard 1920:425).4 Again in the domain of color, White Mountain Apache is innovative in that the basic term for red is lichoo', while other Apachean languages use -chii or some variant thereof (except for Mesca- lero, which is even more innovative, using titu [Breuninger et al. 1982:144]). No doubt lichoo' is also a recent White Mountain Apache innovation, since Goddard reports the stem -chiz' for 'red gaan [a class of deity]' (Goddard 1920:424; cf. also</page><page sequence="3">358 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 Greenfeld 1980; 1986) and, moreover, this stem can be reconstructed in this meaning to Proto-Athabaskan as*ts'ix Y (Young and Morgan 1992:89). 2.2. Bird and animal terms. Terms for animals also involve variation. One of the more surprising semantic shifts is the White Mountain Apache use of the term dlq' for 'bird', while Navajo and Mescalero use the term dlkg' for 'prairie dog'. There is also the word for 'owl', WMA mboh.5 Terms for 'owl' in three other Apachean languages use the handling verb stem for 'multiple small objects', referring to the feathers between an owl's eyes. Thus, in Navajo the term is nd'eshjaa' (Young and Morgan 1992:261), and in Chiricahua and Mescalero is niishjaa (Hoijerl946c:76; Hoijer and Opler 1938:158). Jicarilla goes its own way with yddye' (Wilson 1996:119).6 White Mountain Apache creates a number of animal terms with the noun stem mba'.7 Examples include mba'ts'oosd'coyote, slim fox', mba'cho'wolf', (lit., 'big fox')', mba'nteeld 'badger' (lit., 'wide fox'), mba'ndee 'monkey' (lit., 'white man fox'). Navajo m#'ii 'coyote' and m&amp;'iitsoh 'wolf' are cognate with White Mountain Apache; but alternate words exist for 'badger', nahashch'idi (Young and Morgan 1992:1058), and 'monkey', magi - mogi, an English loan (Young and Morgan 1992:1009). Mescalero expands the semantic range of this noun stem even more, using it at times to mean any generic animal, ma'ye (Hoijer and Opler 1938:211), and also applying it to 'lizard', ma'ishoi (Hoijer and Opler 1938:175). 2.3. Other lexical differences. Further examples of lexical differences include:'my wife', WMA shi'aad, NAV she'esdzrin;8 'coffee', WMA t6dilhilf (lit., 'black water'), NAV 'ahwidh (&lt; Spanish cafe); 'holy man, singer', WMA diyin, NAV hataahii; 'white man', WMA nda', NAV bilagina (&lt; Spanish americano); 'my penis', WMA shila', NAV shiziz; 'children', WMA chaghgshi, NAV 'alchinf. Some of the lexical distinctiveness of White Mountain Apache derives from the fact that Athabaskan languages typically apply descriptive labels to various events or things; this may result in the same thing, event, or type of event hav- ing different lexical labels. The different Navajo and White Mountain Apache terms for their languages mentioned earlier, are one example. A second is the terms for the girl's puberty ceremony. This latter event has a variety of names among the Apachean societies. White Mountain Apache calls it naa'it'ees, a verb whose stem means 'to lift one foot at a time stepping'.9 Its literal meaning probably applies to the stepping action, which the godmother does as part of the ritual massage, but the term itself is now frozen. Navajo similarly uses a frozen form. They call the ceremony kinaaldd, a term that literally translates as 'house alone she sits'. This at one time referred to a menstrual hut such as the one that Northern Athabaskans use. Navajos currently disagree on its translation (Frisbie 1967:8). For Mescalero, the term is 'isdz dziil~gu kada'id'e' 'she becomes a woman and gives a feast', based on the verb stems 'to be, exist' and</page><page sequence="4">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 359 'to eat'. It is obvious how such lexical differences develop, given the fact that Athabaskan languages often use a variety of compounding and word formation processes.lo There are also a few lexical items that simply do not occur in Navajo but do occur in White Mountain Apache or the other Apachean languages. I will men- tion two examples." One of these is the word for 'owl' already mentioned above. The second is gaan 'mountain spirit', which has the cognate form g#ghe in Chiricahua-Mescalero and ghp# in Jicarilla (Vincenti 1981:18), but has no equi- valent in Navajo. Even its source is obscure, unless it comes from the stem -gan darm'. Let us now look at specific differences in morphemes, morpheme form, or morpheme function. 3. Stem form. There is a surprising amount of consistency across the Apachean languages in stems, especially verb stems. This means that when doing research in White Mountain Apache or its sisters one can use Young and Morgan's Analytical Lexicon of Navajo (1992) to great advantage. Nevertheless, with some noun stems, neuter verbs, or intransitive verbs, there are differences in stem form in White Mountain Apache when compared to Navajo. Some of these differences are phonologically regular. One of the most noticeable of these occurs in a class of stems that have the canonical form CV with low tone in White Mountain Apache, corresponding to Navajo stems of the form CVn.12 These are listed in table 1. Table 1. Stems with White Mountain Apache CY Corresponding to Navajo CVn WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE NAVAJO GLOss sit sin 'song' goghg hoghan 'wickiup, hogan' naagoltt nahaltin 'rain' ti tin 'ice' sig# sigan 'dry' godiy~t diyin 'holy' lii# likan 'good tasting, sweet' nichp niichon 'stink' golchi halchin 'smell' tsk tsin 'stick, wood' ndp ridon 'tight, taut' ha'deezb ha'deezbin 'full' k kin 'house' chi chin 'dirty' "it'ti ntl'in 'gummy, thick' dichi dichin 'eat a lot, hungry' 'idj 'Adin 'gone, dead, extinct' tBut 'his song' is WMA biyin. tThis is historically derived from the same stem as si 'song'. 'Medicine man, singer' is diyin (lit., 'holy man').</page><page sequence="5">360 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 The historical process is clear. Apachean vowels were allophonically nasal before nasals. White Mountain Apache has since lost the final nasal, leaving the nasalized vowel in final position.13 It is not possible to assume, however, that a Navajo stem with the form CVn, will always have a direct counterpart in White Mountain Apache. For example, corresponding to Navajo iikon 'it is flammable', White Mountain Apache does not have *lik, but instead has likp', with a final glottal stop. Even in this example, White Mountain Apache has lost the final nasal. There appears to be another small class of noun stems where White Moun- tain Apache has shortened a vowel that Navajo has in a lengthened form. Exam- ples are given in table 2. Table 2. White Mountain Apache CVn Stems Corresponding to Navajo CVVn Stems WHITE MOUNTAIN APACHE NAVAJO GLOSS 'igan 'agaan 'arm' 'ighMn 'aghdan 'back' 'isdzdn 'asdzdin 'woman' 'itin 'atiin 'trail' hdri'din hddidiin 'pollen' 'iziz 'aziiz 'belt' nad ' naad44' 'corn' nadin naadiin 'twenty' The words for 'corn' and 'twenty' are actually compounds. These two words each contain two examples of the short vowel-long vowel correspondence.14 Mescalero appears to share at least some of these forms with White Moun- tain Apache, 'arm' being -ganrd and 'ice' being ti, but not others. For exam- ple,'woman' is isdz&amp;ig in Mescalero (Breuninger et al. 1982:76, 61, 72), where the final nasal has been lost, but the vowels have been nasalized. In both the preceding cases, it is apparent that White Mountain Apache shortens some stems relative to Navajo either by nasal deletion or vowel reduction. There are also a few stems whose initial consonant has changed form, such as White Mountain Apache zhaaazh" and NAV yaazhi'little', WMA zas, NAV yas 'snow', or WMA -zee, NAV -yd 'to be called or named'. These have been com- mented on before, at least with respect to internal variation in Navajo (cf. Saville-Troike 1974). In addition, there have been vowel shifts in some stems, e.g., WMA shi'if, NAV shi'd' 'my shirt', WMA shik'4i, NAV shik'dfi'my relative'. 4. Particles. What are often called particles or clitics in Athabaskan lan- guages are morphemes that create relative clauses when added to verbs, indi- cate something like a case relationship of a noun to the rest of the sentence (cf. Elgin 1973), or act like a specifier or determiner. This section focuses on the use</page><page sequence="6">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 361 of the locative clitic yO, the relative clitic go, and the demonstratives or nominal- izers -i and-ri. 4.1. Locative -yd. White Mountain Apache has a locative -yo that Navajo does not seem to have even in a cognate form. An equivalent but probably not cognate form in Navajo may be -goo 'to, toward, along, on' (Young and Morgan 1992: 939). It functions in a parallel way to -yo, even though it appears not to be phonologically related. Mescalero not only seems to have a similar form, but in fact has two: -yd 'at this or that place' and -yuu 'in this or that direction' (Breuninger et al. 1982:24). Although Mescalero -yuu looks as if it is phonologically cognate, -yd seems to be more similar in function (Breuninger et al. 1982:28). Jicarilla Apache also has a form -ye that is parallel (Wilson and Martine 1996:4, 9). Certainly Mescalero -yuu is historically cognate, and if Jicarilla -ye is not, it obviously functions as WMA -y6 does. In White Mountain Apache, -yo is used to form the WH interrogative 'where', haiyo, and is added to place names, postpositions, or nouns when they function as locations. It might be glossed as 'at', 'to', or 'there'. (1) haiyo din riyaa 'Where are you (singular) going?' (2) chilghozhy6 dfyddi 'I am going to Whiteriver.' (3) haiyd gol~" 'Where does he/she live?' (4) Mary Jones bik'y6 gol "' 'He/she lives at Mary Jones's house.' (5) gid1 ki bit'dhy6d(de') golif 'The cat lives there under the house.' Examples (6a)-(7c) illustrate the parallel functioning of WMA -y6, Jicarilla -yd, and Navajo -g66.15 (6a) haiyd dinyaa (WMA) 'Where are you going?' (6b) ha'yr~n~ dinyd (Jicarilla) 'Where are you going?' (6c) hEidg66sh(g) diniyd (Navajo) 'Where are you going?'</page><page sequence="7">362 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 (7a) chilghozhy6 diydd'6 (WMA) 'I am going to Whiteriver.' (7b) shigha'ye deya (Jicarilla) 'I am going to my home.' (7c) yootddg66 de4d (Navajo) 'I am going to Santa Fe.' 4.2. Relativizer -go. The particle -go functions as a relativizer in White Mountain Apache, as in (8)-(13). (8) 'ishkiin 'ilhoshgo 'ieh4i 'The boy who is sleeping is snoring.' (9) kj ?igaigo goshdleezh 'I am painting the house white.' (lit., 'House that is whitening I paint it.') (10) ki godriliggo higai 'The house that burned down was (a line of) white (ashes).' (11) John dzaacddzi yiztatgo '4zik'ehgo bikee ndii 'John, because of kicking the mule, hurt his foot.' (12) John natjaggo nadilghod 'John, who is fast, is strong.' (13) John sabooli 'oyiti'"go taa'ii Mary yitnded 'John was throwing the ball and Mary caught it.' The same enclitic can also make a neuter verb into a modifier of another neuter verb, as in the phrases dithilgo doti'izh '(being) dark blue', iigaigo dithit '(being) light black'. Of course, most of this is much like Navajo, which has a clitic -go of closely similar function. However, White Mountain Apache does differ in using -go also as an equivalent of Navajo -fg. A recent doctoral dissertation by Brian Potter (1997) discusses the use of -go and another clitic -hzi as nominal focus markers in San Carlos Apache. Potter's emphasis on the function of -go as primarily a NP marker seems similar to Elgin's dissertation on Navajo (1973), in which she analyzed a variety of clitics as case markers, the emphasis being on their function with respect to nouns and noun phrases, and not as subordinating clause markers. It is clear that these particles are also used in White Mountain Apache with both verbs and nouns and, for that matter, postpositions, being added to mark emphasis, focus, stative qualities, gerunds, and relative clauses. Further examples of the use of-go include: bitis 'better', bitisgo 'being better'; tde" 'night,</page><page sequence="8">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 363 tie"'go 'being night'; nlt'ei 'good', nlt'eigo 'being good'. It is probably also the same morpheme that appears in the interrogative haago'what'. In contrast, Navajo also uses the clitic -zgt' to subordinate verbs or parti- cularize nouns and the like. White Mountain Apache uses -go not only in the situations where Navajo uses -go, but also seems to use this particle in places where Navajo uses -g*'. I am not prepared in this article to discuss or resolve all the questions about relative clause formation in White Mountain Apache. However, the sentence 'ishkiin 'ithoshgo 'ilhi 'The boy who is sleeping is snoring' is clearly parallel to the Navajo sentence 'ashkii 'alhoshigii 'athii' (same translation), cited by Platero in his paper on Navajo relative clauses (1974:203). The lack of the morpheme -gn'(is clearly a distinctive characteristic of White Mountain Apache. 4.3. Nominalizers -i and -i Among the nominalizers or determiner enclitics in White Mountain Apache we find -i(- -if- -hff- -e- -a)7 and -ri. These can be compared to Navajo -4, -ii, and -nii (Young and Morgan 1992:936, 942). White Mountain Apache -4 can be suffixed to a variety of forms to produce a nominal with the meaning 'the one which' or 'the particular one'. This resem- bles Navajo. However, White Mountain Apache also has the clitic -ri - -n, which specifically functions to make a human or anthropomorphic form out of the preceding noun or verb. It might be glossed as 'the person (who)' or 'the people (who)'. The use of -(versus -ri seems to depend upon whether you are pointing to the particular nature of a thing, or emphasizing its anthropomorphic charac- teristics. Mescalero also apparently has this contrast (Breuninger et al. 1982: 28). The enclitic -ri also can be used to create an agentive from the basic stem, meaning much the same thing as English -er. In contemporary White Mountain Apache, -ri appears to be highly productive. Its use as an anthropomorphizer is exemplified in (14a)-(16c). (14a) nchaa 'big' (14b) nchaahi 'the big one' (14c) nchaahri 'the person who is big' (15a) shimaa 'my mother' (15b) shimaa'r/ 'my particular mother'</page><page sequence="9">364 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 (15c) shimaahri 'the person who is my mother' (16a) libaa 'gray' (16b) libaahi 'that gray one' (16c) libaahri 'the person who is gray' Hill (1963:153) believes this particular anthropomorphizing clitic is one of the characteristic differences between White Mountain Apache and San Carlos Apache, in that White Mountain Apache productively uses -ri to anthropo- morphize a variety of stems, while San Carlos does not. In San Carlos, its use seems similar to Navajo in that it is only used as an agentive in primarily frozen forms, a usage upon which I will comment further below (section 4-4). White Mountain Apache also uses this morpheme with the meaning 'people'; thus it appears at the end of clan names, as in (17a)-(17d). (17a) be'iltsoodri 'made yellow people' (17b) naagodolts'oosri 'slender peak standing up people' (17c) t'i"sk'aadri 'cottonwoods standing people' (17d) deeschftri 'horizontally red people' A comparable Navajo clitic has the form -nii, which means 'people of' and is also used as a component of clan names (Young and Morgan 1992:942,1090), as in (18a)-(18b). (18a) to dich'if'nii 'bitter water clan' (18b) hashtlishnii 'mud clan' It is also used in Navajo as a label for groups of people other than clans (Young and Morgan 1992:942), as in (19a)-(19b).</page><page sequence="10">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 365 (19a) be'esh rit'i'nii 'people who live by the railroad' (19b) dine nahodldonii 'Northern Athabaskans' (lit., 'the other people') It seems highly likely that both WMA -ri and NAV -nii derive from the same protoform. In White Mountain Apache, the final vowels have been absorbed as high tone. It also seems highly likely that the original term meant 'man' or 'human being'. Compare the Navajo term for 'man', dine". This consists of a thematic prefix di- plus a stem -nd-the Proto-Athabaskan form of the stem that would seem a likely candidate for the etymological source of WMA -ri, NAV -nii. 4.4. Agentative -ri ~ -n. What seems to be an agentive use of the clitic -ri in White Mountain Apache occurs with certain verbs; some examples are listed in table 3. Table 3. White Mountain Apache Agentive Forms Using the Enclitic -n VERB AGENTIVE 'ilgash 'hex' 'ilgashn 'witch' log hayiileeh 'to fish' (lit., 'to make fish') tog hayiileehn 'fisherman' yil'aa 'third person sends't yil'aahri 'sender't naa'iTl'ees 'she steps on her't naa'Yi'eesri 'stepper't tThese forms are from Hill (1963:153). tThese are the terms used to refer to the "god- mother" in the girl's puberty ceremony, who uses her feet to massage the girl. Although this anthropomorphizing morpheme is quite productive, there are also many cases where its use seems to be frozen. In White Mountain Apache, the term diyin 'medicine man'18 is derived historically from si 'song'; when inflected, this stem becomes d'yj 'sing, holy', which, with the addition of -n, results in 'holy man' (lit., 'singer'?). Navajo, on the other hand, expresses the same meaning by adding the clitic -ii to the polysemous verb 'kick, sing' to generate hataalii (Young and Morgan 1992:490).19 Navajo has a form diyin derived in the same way as the White Mountain Apache word, but in Navajo it refers to the Holy People (a class of deities), not to a person who is holy. Other forms in White Mountain Apache besides diyin that apparently have the clitic -n in a frozen form include: nant'dri 'boss, leader', bik'ego hidaari 'God' (lit., 'because of him life is'), yuusi 'God' (&lt; Spanish Dios), and 'isdzdn 'woman'. Navajo also has this morpheme in some frozen forms. Others besides diyin include hastiin 'mature man' and 'asdzdin 'woman'. Navajo also seems to use its morpheme -nii occasionally with agentive function. One such form is naa- t'danii 'boss' (Young and Morgan 1992:26). The agentive use of -nii seems to be far less common in Navajo than the agentive use of-n in Apache.</page><page sequence="11">366 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 These forms in White Mountain Apache and Navajo appear to be cognate with northern Athabaskan forms such as the Ahtna enclitic -ne, which is de- rived from the Ahtna word for 'person'. Kari (1990:295), for example, gives the following forms: (20a) nt'iine 'Where are they?' (20b) gaane 'these people, local people' (20c) taane 'three people' 4.5. The clitic -n in the pronouns haanr and 'Ari. The clitic -ri also probably occurs in the demonstrative pronoun 'dri 'that person', in (21), which contrasts with 'dii~ 'e. 'that thing' in (22). (21) 'ann 'isdzanhri 'that woman' (22) ' i yaangogai golzeeyd 'at that place called whiteness extends outward' In (21), there is even agreement between the clitic on the end of the noun and the demonstrative pronoun; however, that is not always the case. There may in fact be two occurrences of the clitic in 'isdzanhri 'woman' in (21), if the n of 'isdzin is a frozen instance of it (cf. section 4.4). An element -ri also occurs in the interrogative pronoun haa'n 'who' in (23). (This may be a contraction of haa plus dri, the human demonstrative pronoun.) Thus, we get a sentence such as (23). (23) haan 'aaadat'j ndeehi 'Who are those particular men?' Although Navajo has the demonstrative eif, it does not appear to have 'tir or haari (at least Young and Morgan [1992:931,934-35] do not list them). This is a noticeable difference between the two languages. 4.6. Negative. The basic way to negate verbs in Apachean languages is to surround the verb with a discontinuous morpheme do-..-da. Elgin (1973:127) illustrates this point for Navajo, and also notes that the scope of negation is variable. White Mountain Apache does not deviate from this pattern, except that it has an optional additional element haa that appears to add extra</page><page sequence="12">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 367 emphasis and is also the basis of a strong negative epithet. Thus, the word dohaada20 is an extremely forceful way to say 'no!'; see, for example, the dia- logue in (24). (24) A: zhaali a'shaanitsoos 'Give me one dollar.' B: zhaali dohaada 'Money, there's none!' The element haa is presumably a stem, since it occurs in an independent word surrounded by do-..-da as would a verb. Further evidence of its stemlike function is that occasionally one hears it alone as haada. When used in negating a sentence, haa also appears as an optional proclitic. Thus, one can say either do'iish'hjda 'I don't see it' or dohaa'iish'{{da 'I don't see it'. Edgerton (1963:124) glosses proclitic haa as 'yet', thus translating dohaa'iish'jjda as 'I don't see it yet'. This would be one way to indicate emphasis in English and seems com- patible with my analysis of haa as a type of intensifier. When haa occurs with do-..-da to intensify the negation of another constituent, haa always immedi- ately follows do-. Goodwin claimed that dohaada was a recent slang term "coined at Fort Apache only a few years ago" (1942:292), but he does not provide any informa- tion as to its morphemic source.21 Goodwin was probably wrong about this; the term goes back at least to 1920, as Goddard transcribes it in his White Mountain Apache Texts (1920) at least twice: first (1920:442) in the phrase do xa n dec ida, which he glosses as 'I have seen no one', and the second time (1920:475) in the phrase Ii ni do xa da, glossed as 'horses were not'. Contemporary transcriptions of these two phrases that fill in missing length, tone, nasalization, and the like would no doubt be, respectively, dohaa ndeei 'ish'(fda 'I have seen no man'22 and I''ni dohaada 'horses, there are none'. Haa also seems to have been recorded by Bourke (Condie 1980:91, 108) in the 1870s or 1880s in the forms tu-hay-dilti-di 'hoarse, don't talk', and tu- higue-dd 'nothing'. Contemporary transcriptions would probably be dohaa yaltida and dohaagoda. As in other Apachean languages, the proclitic portions of the negator, in- cluding haa, can be placed before any constituent of the sentence that is within the semantic scope of negation. For instance, one can negate a noun, as in John do(haa)na(i)biil tdyigisda 'John did not wash the car', or a verb, as in John na(U)biil do(haa)tayigisda 'John the car did not wash'. In the example cited from Goddard above, dohaa ndee 'ish'Eda 'I have seen no man', negation in- cluded not just the verb, but also the subject, 'man'. It is possible that has is derived from the interrogative particle that occurs in haat'i'what', haiyd 'where', haan' 'who', and so on. There are forms dohaari</page><page sequence="13">368 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 da 'no one' and dohaagoda 'nothing' that may be based on interrogatives, but it is hard to see an interrogative meaning in most of the places where haa occurs with the negative.23 5. Conjunctions. Relative to Navajo, White Mountain Apache differs with respect to at least three conjunctions. First, it has a conjunction Navajo does not have, laa'" 'and'. Second, it has a form that may be cognate with a Navajo postposition, but which seems to function in White Mountain Apache as a con- junction, hik'e 'and, and then, after'. Third, Navajo has a conjunction d66 'and' (Young and Morgan 1992:938), apparently Navajo's most common conjunction, which White Mountain Apache does not have. According to Young and Morgan, d66 is actually an enclitic, but is usually written as an independent form. 5.1. laa'ii. This seems to be the most basic conjunction used in White Mountain Apache. It links both noun phrases, as in John taa'ii Mary dlobyo naa'aash 'John and Mary are going to Globe (a town)', and clauses, as in John saboolf 'oyRkdi'go iaa'ii Mary yitndcid 'John was throwing the ball and Mary caught it'. This conjunction may come from the stem la' 'one, some', which is phonologically similar. 5.2. hik'e. A second conjunction that differs from Navajo is hik'e 'and, and then, after'. This form is not listed as a conjunction in Navajo (Young and Morgan 1992:942-43), although the stems -keh 'in compensation for', -k'eh 'according to', and -kk'e - -k'i 'on, on to' are (Young and Morgan 1992:345, 346, 926).24 Navajo does have a conjunction doo bik'iji', glossed as 'and after' (Young and Morgan 1992:943), that looks as if it were derived from one of these postpositions. White Mountain Apache has similar postpositions and it seems most likely to me that the White Mountain Apache conjunction hik'e is actually a form of the White Mountain Apache postposition -k'dh, which means 'on account of, because of' (as in the name of the Creator, bik'dhgo hidaari 'on account of him is life'). Hik'e does not seem to be used as frequently as laa'((by White Mountain Apache speakers. I suspect that perhaps the meaning difference between 1aa'#f and hik'e in White Mountain Apache might be similar to the difference in English between 'and' and 'because' in the sentences John hurt his foot because he kicked the mule and John kicked the mule and hurt his foot. In fact, Edgerton (1963:123) glosses hik'e as 'after, and then'. The possibility that its meaning involves some sense of 'on account of' is also evidenced by the fact that there is an obviously related postpositional form 'aikT'hgo 'on account of', which can be used in a sentence such as John dzaaddzi yiztal(go) 'iik'dhgo bikee ndii 'John kicked the mule and on account of that he hurt his foot'. Although there is obviously some meaning difference between laa'ff and hik'e in my own data, I also have several examples where consultants claim that</page><page sequence="14">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 369 they are interchangeable; for example, John faa'ii Mary dloby6 di'aash or John hik'e Mary dlobyd di'aash 'John and Mary are going to Globe', and John masaanataa'ii masidna nk'zhi bil nit'eh or John masidna hik'e masdina nk'izhi bil nit'eh 'John likes apples and lemons'. Because I lacked further examples of the comparable function of these two conjunctions in my own data, I also looked for examples in the Western Apache translation of the New Testament (American Bible Society 1969). Several relevant examples include: niye' hik'e bg bilgo 'your son and his mother with him' (1969:11),25 taagi jjt hik'e taagi tl'e' 'three days and three nights' (1969:53), and James hik'e John bilgo 'James and John with him' (1969:185). One particularly interesting set of examples demonstrating their functional equivalence is found in two different occurrences of the phrase 'scribes and chief priests'. In the first occurrence the conjunction hik'e appears: begoz'aanh1 ye'k'eda' 'icchihi hik'e 'okph yebik'ehi 'itisyo nadaandeehi 'the scribes and chief priests' (1969:189); and in the second the conjunction la'fY is used: 'okggh yebik'ehi 'itisyo nadaandeehfi la'ii begoz'aanih ye'ik'eda' 'itchihi 'the chief priests and scribes' (1969:339).26 The only difference is in the order of the conjoined noun phrases. Potter also discusses a San Carlos Apache form that is obviously cognate with White Mountain Apache hik'e. He cites examples where the morpheme he writes as k'eh appears independently of any prefix, as in Hastiin k'eh nailin go ishkiin dayiztal 'The old man and the girl kicked the boy' (1997:259). Potter, because he is using the Chomskyan minimalist model, tries to explain the distri- bution of k'eh in terms of underlying syntactic constraints-specifically, that k'eh can perhaps only be used to conjoin certain types of constituents-although he does not commit himself on this matter, since it is outside the scope of his dissertation (Potter 1997:260). My assumption is that there is a slight meaning difference and that choice between the two conjunctions in either dialect of Western Apache is not syn- tactically motivated. Jicarilla (Wilson 1996:128) and Mescalero (Breuninger et al. 1982:30) use the form sh[i for 'and', which does not appear to have any cognate in White Mountain Apache. 6. Interrogatives. Another point of divergence between White Mountain Apache and Navajo emerges in the interrogatives: White Mountain Apache does not have the interrogative particle -'ish. So, for example, the basic question 'What is it?' comes out in White Mountain Apache as (25), while in Navajo an equivalent sentence is (26). (25) haat'holzee 'What is it called?' (26) haat'ish 'at'eh 'What kind is it?'</page><page sequence="15">370 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 Besides lacking -'ish, White Mountain Apache forms yes-no questions by adding ne or ya' at the end of the sentence. Navajo has ya', but it does not have -ne. The two forms of White Mountain Apache yes-no questions are exemplified in (27a)-(27b). (27a) chilghozhy6 driyaand 'Are you going to Whiteriver?' (27b) chilghozhy6 dnriyaaya' 'Are you going to Whiteriver?' Northern Athabaskan languages, such as Slave, may have cognates with WMA ne forms. Rice (1989:1130) describes an interrogative particle ni for Slave. In White Mountain Apache, ne may be used on its own to get confirmation when something is not clear in conversation and the hearer would like to get a yes-no response. The particle ya' can also be optionally used at the beginning of a yes-no question when -ne is used at the end (cf. Edgerton 1963:137). Thus, example (27a) could also have the form ya' chilghozhy6 diriyaand. Ya' may also be used at the beginning of a sentence by itself, or before a constituent elsewhere in the sentence. Goddard (1920:411) has several examples, one of which I retranscribe as (28). (28) ya' 'its'aa bizhaazhi ya' baa nyaa ndlt interrogative eagle its-young interrogative to-them you-come he-said ch'idLi they-say 'He asked eagle's children, "Did you come?" they say.' 7. Independent pronouns. There are several features of the pronominal system that differentiate White Mountain Apache, in comparison with Navajo. 7.1. Personal pronouns. Paradigms of independent personal pronouns are displayed in table 4. This table includes Mescalero forms, since they are avail- able, as well as White Mountain Apache and Navajo.27 There are three major differences between Navajo and White Mountain Apache. First, the third person forms differ significantly in the initial consonants: WMA k vs. NAV h. Second, the vowel after the n of the first and second person dual and plural differs: WMA o, NAV i. Third, White Mountain Apache uses a unique form for the independent possessive. In White Mountain Apache, this form is used with wild animals and other things that cannot actually be owned. Thus, a domestic animal such as a horse takes a possessive prefix, shi4' 'lmy horse', but a deer that one has killed is referred to as blih shlyed 'my deer'. This creates three categories of noun:</page><page sequence="16">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 371 alienable, which includes a variety of objects; inalienable, covering body parts and kinship terms; and unpossessable, for wild animals whose carcasses can be owned, but which themselves cannot be owned. Mescalero, with its multiplicity of third person forms and other phonological changes, is divergent from both White Mountain Apache and Navajo. Table 4.

This additional meaning distinction is why they have such a multiplicity of third person forms, and deserves additional detailed investigation. 7.2. Demonstrative pronouns. There is also a phonological difference in the demonstrative pronouns: White Mountain Apache 'di, NAV 'ei', Mescalero 'if 'that'. 8. Pronominal prefixes. There are some differences in the various pro- nominal prefixes. Hoijer (1945c) has covered this area rather completely. He does not cite White Mountain Apache forms, but his San Carlos forms seem to be</page><page sequence="17">372 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 consistent with White Mountain Apache forms. In the following discussion I will simply highlight certain differences that distinguish White Mountain Apache from Navajo. 8.1. Object prefixes. Hoijer (1945c:197) provides a chart comparing the object pronouns. If White Mountain Apache forms were added to that chart, they would be the same as his San Carlos forms. So far as the object pronouns are concerned, White Mountain Apache and San Carlos differ from the others in having ko- for singular 3a (referent in a respect relationship) and nohi- for first and second person dual and plural. 8.2. Possessive prefixes. The indefinite possessive prefixes, which parallel the object prefixes, also differ. White Mountain Apache and Mescalero 'i- correspond to Navajo 'a-'someone's'.28 This correspondence can be seen in a number of the nouns cited in table 2; for example, WMA 'igan, NAV 'agaaan 'arm'. What I presume to be the same prefix in a frozen form also occurs in the words for 'boy' and 'woman' that are compared in table 5. Table 5. Indefinite Possessives in White Mountain Apache and Navajo WMA NAVAJO GLOSS 'isdzdn 'asdzhin 'woman' 'ishkiin 'ashkii 'boy' 8.3. Indefinite human subject. Another difference in the pronominal pre- fixes of White Mountain Apache and Navajo is the form of the verbal prefix for what is sometimes called the "deictic subject pronoun," "unspecified" or "inde- finite human third person," or the "3a" pronoun. White Mountain Apache has ch'i-, while Navajo has ji-, a subject pronoun of position V (Young and Morgan 1992:851). Thus, in White Mountain Apache narratives one frequently hears the disclaimer ch'idi'they say'29 or ch'idileni'"they customarily said'. The Navajo equivalent is jini (Young and Morgan 1987:489). This pronominal prefix occurs also, for example, in WMA ch'iztal 'one danced', and in a noun goch'itaal 'social dance' derived from the same verb. The Mescalero form of the prefix apparently is ji-, as in Navajo, although Hoijer (1945c:201) indicates otherwise. Compare, for example, Mescalero gujitaal 'one sings a ceremony' or ji'eesh 'one strings beads' (Breuninger et al. 1982:21, 37). According to Story (1989:512), the Proto-Athabaskan form of this prefix is * tsw'a. Navajo and Mescalero appear to have dropped the glottalization, while White Mountain Apache retains something closer to the protoform. Saxon (1993) also discusses the cognate form in Dogrib and provides a bibliography of com- parative discussion in the various Athabaskan languages.</page><page sequence="18">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 373 Although it does not contain a pronoun, there is a similar correspondence in the word for 'sun': WMA ch'igona'"ii, NAV jihonaa'd&amp;. The Navajo term is made up of jji-go 'during day' plus a verb that means 'to handle a solid round object'; the corresponding term t1'dhonaa'di 'moon' contains the word 'night'.30 White Mountain Apache also has the terms jif 'day' and ti'gona'a 'moon'. What may have happened in White Mountain Apache is that by analogy with the glot- talized affricate that begins 'moon', j was replaced by ch'. Since the Proto- Athabaskan form of 'day' is *dC ien (Young and Morgan 1992:275), White Moun- tain Apache is obviously the innovative language. The same correspondence recurs in the word for 'bat', WMA ch'aan, NAV jaa'abanf. Just what has happened here is unclear. The Navajo form contains the word -jaa' 'ear', while Apache perhaps has substituted the word ch'ah 'hat'. 8.4. Areal subject. A final difference between White Mountain Apache and Navajo prefixes is the form of what is sometimes called a deictic subject marker referring to place or area. This appears in the same position as the deictic subject discussed above. In Navajo the form is ho- - ha-, depending on phono- logical environment (Young and Morgan 1992:891), while in White Mountain Apache it is go-. Thus, WMA goghi 'wickiup' corresponds to NAV hoghan 'hogan', and WMA gochl 'smell' to NAV hachin. Since it occurs with stems such as naagolti 'rain', it also seems to function somewhat as the dummy subject it does in English weather-related sentences such as It rained. In White Mountain Apache, the prefix go- occurs in a large number of place names, such as those in (29a)-(29f).31 (29a) ni'godeezdg 'land extends straight out place' (29b) yaangogai 'whiteness extends outward place' (Canyon Day) (29c) hagosgeed 'digging up a hole place' (Fort Apache Junction) (29d) nagoltsog 'yellow around place' (29e) tsebildtah da godilkpghe 'bare rock on top its smooth place' (29f) tik'e goedzig 'rotten field place Navajo examples using ho- in a comparable way (from Young and Morgan 1987, 1992) include those in (30a)-(30f).</page><page sequence="19">374 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 (30a) tse honfts'6zi 'Little White House Canyon, Arizona' (30b) 'ahoyoolts'if 'Jacob's Well, Arizona' (30c) be'ek'id h6neez32 'Long Lake, New Mexico' (30d) h6dchxon 'stinky place' (30e) be'ek'id hatso 'large lake' (30f) be'ek'id halgai 'Lake Valley, New Mexico' Note that the Navajo prefix takes a number of different phonological forms. The White Mountain Apache prefix does not vary in this manner. In addition, it might be pointed out that go- is the White Mountain Apache cognate of the Koyukon areal prefix h-, described by Thompson (1993),which has a number of different functions. 9. Peg elements. Each language also has peg elements, "dummy" prefixes that have no semantic content, but appear before verb stems when no other prefixes occur.33 Whereas with the deictic areal subjects Navajo has an h-initial morpheme, with these peg elements it is White Mountain Apache that uses h, while Navajo has y or w depending on the following vowel. In White Mountain Apache, this results in a minimal pair between the words holzee 'it is called' and golzee 'the place is called', the latter using the deictic areal subject prefix. The comparable Navajo set is wolye' 'it is called' and hoolye 'the place is called' (Young and Morgan 1992:695). Another form with a peg element is 'he or she sees': WMA hi'lf', NAV yi'l'. 10. Conclusion. In this article, I have tried to highlight certain differences in the shape and function of morphemes in White Mountain Apache as compared primarily to Navajo, with some attention paid to other Apachean languages. Some of these differences are the result of regular sound change. Others seem to involve a certain amount of lexical or morphological innovation on the part of White Mountain Apache. The features discussed in this article are by no means all of the differences between White Mountain Apache and Navajo or the other Apachean languages, but they are some of the most obvious. One of the blessings and one of the pro-</page><page sequence="20">1999 PHILIPJ. GREENFELD 375 blems in recent Apachean studies is the fact that Navajo, because of the number of its speakers, the vigor of its culture, and the foresight of some very special individuals, has come to dominate our view of Apachean. We can especially thank Robert W. Young and William Morgan, Sr., for their marvelous contri- butions to Navajo studies. On the other hand, this wide range of materials, including the two major dictionaries, is so complete that we tend to view the Apachean languages through Navajo eyes. Language is one of the primary eth- nic boundary markers among Apacheans, and a source of great pride for many of the Apache people. I am constantly told by White Mountain speakers when I mix lexical items or morphemes in my limited use of Apache, "That's not the way we say it. That's the way they talk at San Carlos," or "That's not our word, that's a Navajo word." I also overheard a discussion recently at San Carlos about another non-Indian linguist. The person commenting said, "That guy if he was around here all the time could speak real well. The trouble is that he goes everywhere. When he goes to Camp Verde he comes back and says things like they say things. That's wrong, we don't say them like that over here. He needs to stay in one place." This article has attempted to point out that there are differences between the languages and that these differences are extremely important to the speak- ers of these languages. White Mountain Apache especially has certain distinc- tive morphological characteristics that serve to contrast it with the others. Hopefully, dictionaries similar in scope and completeness to those now available for Navajo will eventually be produced for the other Apachean languages. These would both permit systematic overall comparative studies, and provide young Native Americans from these societies with a major resource for reviving and maintaining these languages before some of them become extinct. Notes Acknowledgments. I was galvanized to write this article by a paper delivered by Willem de Reuse. Although the point of his paper was different from mine, he covered a number of aspects of comparison I had been noting for a number of years but had not put into print. For that I thank him. Abbreviations. NAV = Navajo; WMA = White Mountain Apache. 1. I use the practical orthography suggested in Greenfeld (1972), which is essentially the same as that used for Navajo in Young and Morgan (1992). I thus transcribe all round back vowels with o, because I believe the alternation between [o] and [u] to be allophonic. Note that my transcriptions do not always agree with Perry et al. (1972) or Bray (1998). These sources transcribe several sounds that I believe to be allophonic with separate symbols. 2. The Navajo term is cognate with Mescalero iizhi (Breuninger et al. 1982:144). This is the source I have used for Mescalero citations unless otherwise noted. All Navajo forms are from Young and Morgan (1992) unless otherwise noted. Unattributed White Mountain Apache forms are from my own fieldwork. I have used various members of the Hawkins family of East Fork and Whiteriver as consultants for the last thirty plus years, especially the late Clarence Hawkins, to whom I owe a deep debt of gratitude.</page><page sequence="21">376 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 3. Chiricahua apparently uses -hit (Breuninger et al. 1982:144), although I have noted some Chiricahuas at San Carlos using -zhin. 4. I have taken the liberty of modernizing the transcription of the term. In the original it is gan if ji ne, which, by Goddard's standards, is a pretty good transcription. He had a notoriously bad ear, missed things such as glottalization and tone, and was inconsistent. Sapir's opinion of him is summarized in a letter to Kroeber where he said, "The real fact is, Kroeber, Goddard's work is not good--decidedly not. ... Least of all in phonology" (Golla 1984:355). 5. This is usually heard as b6h among younger speakers. In the Western Apache Dictionary it is, certainly mistakenly, listed as a loan from Spanish buho (Perry et al. 1972:172). Given the importance of the owl to Apache beliefs and mythology, I doubt that this is a non-Athabaskan form, even though it is phonologically very similar to a Spanish form (cf. Greenfeld 1973). One possible northern cognate is the Dena'ina form yesbu 'snowy owl' (Kari 1977:47), which apparently consists of the widely distributed Atha- baskan stem for snow, yes, and -baa 'gray', another widely attested Athabaskan cognate; I take the 'gray' stem to be the source of the Apache word for 'owl'. 6. Most of my Jicarilla examples are from this source. 7. Younger Apaches seem to have finally dropped the prenasalized stop in this form. Greenfeld (1973) comments on this phoneme's resistance to change. 8. The stem -'aad exists in Navajo, but means 'female of the species'. My under- standing is that its use to refer to one's wife is considered vulgar. 9. Although this stem seems to describe the actions of the girl at the dance, it probably does not refer to the actions of the girl, but rather the actions of her godmother. At one phase of the ritual the godmother uses her feet to massage the girl and assure her a straight and strong body. (Cf. Frisbie [1967:409] for comment on this translation.) 10. Sometimes these descriptive phrases are humorous, at least to a cultural outsider. One of my consultants said her grandmother used to go to the trading post and yell across the room, "I want some g6chii bila'(wieners)," or "I want some brid bichilchlt'i (doughnuts)." The literal translation of the former is 'pig its-penis' and of the latter is 'bread that-which-is-its-anus'. 11. To make this sort of claim is always dangerous, and needs qualifications and disclaimers. For instance, I had planned to include what I thought was a third example in this section, namely, WMA bizhidn 'loose woman'. I had scoured Young and Morgan (1987, 1992) several times trying to find a cognate and been unsuccessful. On one final try, however, I found listed under the Navajo stem -yd 'one person goes' the phrase bizhdhi (- bizhidn) naashi 'a bachelor' (Young and Morgan 1992:672). In the dictionary bizhdhd is glossed as 'by oneself, alone' (Young and Morgan 1987:263). This appears to be a cognate form. In White Mountain Apache, the term is applied primarily to loose or divorced women, whose behavior is discussed in detail by Goodwin (1942:295). In this sense the term is generally pejorative. The Apache term may be related to a kinship term cited by one of my consultants as shibizh# my unmarried daughter (woman speaking)', which may literally translate as 'my she only one'. The White Mountain Apache Dictionary lists zh4i as 'only' (Perry et al. 1972:52), and this may be cognate with the Navajo term mentioned above. If so, the difference in nasality of the vowel remains to be accounted for. 12. It is well known that, in the Apachean languages, short final open syllables end in a phonetic [h], which has been called "inorganic 'h'" by Hoijer (1945a:27; cf. also Greenfeld 1972:133). Thus, all of the cited White Mountain Apache forms are actually [CYh] phonetically. 13. In my dissertation, I claimed that allophonic nasalization before nasals was a matter of free variation (Greenfeld 1972:157) or did not occur (Greenfeld 1972:35). The latter statement was a typographical error and should have read "a phonetic effect which</page><page sequence="22">1999 PHILIP J. GREENFELD 377 does not occur consistently in White Mountain Apache." I now believe that I was simply mistaken in not hearing allophonic nasalization and that in fact both places in my dissertation need revision; allophonic nasalization is in fact obligatory. 14. 'Twenty' is formed with an element WMA -din, NAV -diin, also added to the other basic numerals in both languages to form decades, i.e., 'thirty', 'forty', etc. These suffixes are probably derived from a term for 'man' referring to a person's ten fingers as being equal to one whole 'man'; thus twenty is 'two men' (Cook 1971:435; Closs 1986:7). Note that the initial consonant in this form is a d, whereas some other morphemes that also probably derive from the word for 'person' or 'man', to be discussed elsewhere, have an n. 15. Unfortunately, the Mescalero dictionary does not supply sentences parallel to the examples compared, but it does give the forms xa'yi 'where' and set higaya 'the place of white sand' (Breuninger et al. 1982:22, 28), indicating that Mescalero -ya functions like these other enclitics. 16. Note that White Mountain Apache uses tone to differentiate first person from other persons with this and a few other verb stems (Hill n.d.); thus difya 'I go' vs. dfyaa 'he, she goes'. 17. This suffix has a number of allomorphs and seems to be lengthened (-ii) when additional emphasis is needed. I do not believe that lengthening it actually makes it a different morpheme. With some stems it exhibits vowel harmony. Thus, in the White Mountain Apache word for 'those from San Carlos' we find dilzhf'o and in the word for 'Mescalero' we hear hai'ii'hi. I have heard 'my mother' as both shimaa'i and shimaa'A. 18. This form in Navajo refers to the Holy People (but cf. Witherspoon [1977:15] for further explication). 19. The verb in Navajo is usually glossed as 'sing', but it is clear that it is related to both the Navajo verb for 'kick, move the foot abruptly' and a Hupa verb that means 'do the kick dance' (Young and Morgan 1992:486-91). No doubt, since singing and dancing are both part of ritual, the meaning is metonymically linked in a chain, 'kick' &gt; 'dance' &gt; 'sing'. In fact, many Navajo, or for that matter Athabaskan, verbs that appear to involve homonymy are polysemous, with metaphor and metonym producing complex family- resemblance chains of meaning (Taylor 1989). The stem si from which WMA dfyin is historically derived is very similar. Ritual involves contact with the holy through sing- ing; thus, again we have metonym linking two seemingly distant meanings of the same core stem. This is probably not a cognitively productive metaphor in White Mountain Apache today, however. Contemporary Western Apaches do not seem to make a semantic link between bighin 'his song' and dfyin. In fact, there even seems to be a surface contrast that has developed between y and gh in the two forms. 20. Phonetically the h is a strong velar fricative that is heavily labialized by pro- gressive assimilation, producing [xW]. I do not write it as hw, because labialization is purely allophonic. 21. I would like to thank David Samuels for calling my attention to this statement. 22. Willem de Reuse believes that this should be do haari dish'hfda 'I have seen no one' (p.c. 1998). 23. There is a Navajo stem that may be related to WMA haa. The neuter imperfec- tive verb stem ghah is glossed by Young and Morgan (1992:219) as 'proportionate to, capable of'; it can also function as a postposition meaning 'beside'. Navajo apparently does not use this stem with the negative, but it is a possible source for WMA haa. If it is the source, I cannot explain why the initial consonant devoices from gh to h when preceded by the vowel of do-. 24. Here again there seems to be a chain of meaning in what are obviously related postpositions. One meaning of k'eh is 'according to', which easily becomes 'because of', which in turn becomes 'in exchange for'; from 'I work because of money', the next logical</page><page sequence="23">378 ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS 41 NO. 3 step is to work 'in exchange for' money (Young and Morgan 1992:345-46). 25. The translators use the form b## for 'mother' a number of times. Since kinship terms need a possessive prefix, I assume it is a contraction of bimaa. I personally have never heard it, although Goodwin (1942:197) reports na and ba as second and third person forms for 'mother'. 26. I have taken the liberty of converting these phrases into the transcription used for other examples in this article. 27. Phonetically, the h in the nonsingular White Mountain Apache forms is [hw] or [xw], and occasionally even [4)]. These forms are transcribed in (Perry et al. 1972) with hw; however, I prefer the transcription h because the labialization is purely allophonic, a case of progressive assimilation from the preceding o. 28. Navajo does have several allomorphs, including 'i-, but 'a- seems to be the most common. 29. One of my consultants glosses this as 'gossip'. 30. Note that this is another example of the correspondence ai : ei noted earlier. In some Navajo dialects, the stem contains ai, like Apache (Young and Morgan 1992:11). The ho in these Navajo forms, which corresponds to the go in the Apache forms, is not the areal subject discussed in section 8.3, but rather the enclitic -go that was discussed in section 4.2. For some phonological reason it here occurs in the form ho instead of go. 31. Some of these were taken from Basso et al. (1986). 32. The prefix ho- takes a high tone when it absorbs ni- (Young and Morgan 1992:891). 33. I am grateful to Kenneth Hale for pointing out what I thought was a genuine prefix in Apache was in fact a peg element. References American Bible Society 1969 Bih'ehgo'ihi'nani Biyati'.
