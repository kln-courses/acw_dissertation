<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROYAL BIRDS. By Lillian Grace Paca. St. Martin's Press, New York, 1963: 61/4 X 91/2 in., xii + 164 pp. Illus. by the author. $7.50. The "Royal Birds" of this book are swans, not only the Mute Swan-long considered the property of the British Crown, but the several other species in the world, all "definitely aristocrats." Seven of the ten chapters are concerned with the different species. The introductory chapter traces the history of the Mute Swan as a bird of royalty, while the concluding two deal with swans in myth and legend and the care and keeping of swans. The generous number of drawings, over 90, show a pleasing softness of line and texture and satisfactor- ily portray a wide range of attitudes and actions. The text reads easily. Although a few errors and ambiguities have crept in, for the most part it is correctly factual-and objective. Only where it is based on the author's observations and interpretations of behavior does it get out of hand, becoming sugary, sentimental, and (in places) out- rageously anthropomorphic. The author seems obsessed with the idea that cygnets must be trained or educated to feed, swim, fly, build nests, and so on. The book is at best a review of, not a contribution to, the knowledge of swans.-OLIN SEWALL PETTINGILL, JR.</page></plain_text>
