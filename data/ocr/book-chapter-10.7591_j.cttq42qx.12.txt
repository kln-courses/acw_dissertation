<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Afterword America/América/Americas It is awkward to speak of peoples who play such an important role on  the world scene, but who lack collective names. The word American may  no longer be applied exclusively to the citizens of the United States of  North America, and it would be desirable if this nomenclature for the  independent nations of the New Continent could be fi xed in a way that  would be at once convenient, consistent, and precise. —Alexander von Humboldt, Political Essay in the Island of Cuba I would really like to fi nd another word for “American.” When someone  says “American” they mean someone who lives between New York and  Los Angeles, and not someone who lives between Montevideo and  Santiago. —Jean Luc Goddard in a 2004 interview I take this afterword as an occasion to reflect on the major assumptions  that underlie my book. Doing so also leads me to address some of the theo- retical and practical implications of what I have proposed about heterolin- gual literature, modernism, and translation in the context of perhaps the  most challenging and exasperating of all false cognates: “America” and  América—challenging because alternatives in English seem needlessly cum- bersome, exasperating because there is so little awareness that there is a  difference and that it matters. READING FOR SURVIVAL This book rests on two fundamental beliefs. The first is that literature mat- ters to life; it is an intellectual and emotional resource crucial for human  survival on this planet. Literature, according to Ottmar Ette, is a storehouse  of knowledge on which we can draw as we contemplate how individuals  and groups can live together in mutual respect for, not just tolerance of,  each other’s diversities, whatever those may be. If this is so, then William  Carlos Williams’s cautionary reminder that “aesthetically, morally, we are  deformed unless we read” applies as much today as it did in 1925, perhaps  even more.1 Since my scholarly concern for some time now has been how  221 </page> <page sequence="2"> 222  The Worlds of Langston Hughes people, ideas, and objects share and contest the space of the Americas, I  decided to put Ette’s dual emphasis on respect and survival to the test in this  book by inquiring into the kinds of knowledge that texts from the Western  Hemisphere might encode and store. What do they have to say about how  to live and write in a world where differences in color, sexuality, politics,  and language, more often than not, become occasions for social and legal  discrimination? Specifically, I wanted to know what sorts of cultural exchanges are pos- sible in spite of such perceived barriers. Langston Hughes quickly emerged  as an almost inescapable focus for such a project because of his worldwide  travels, his knowledge of other languages, his work as a literary translator,  and the fact that his own writings have been translated widely throughout  the Americas. Most important, however, was the fact that his poems, auto- biographies, and translations are exemplary explorations of what it might  mean to live and write, as the title of my introduction suggests, “in others’  words.” This circumstance—some would call it a predicament—had special  salience for Hughes as an African American poet from the USA who was  part of the Harlem Renaissance and, like many other New Negro writers  at the time, flirted extensively with Communism.2 Although Hughes is no  doubt a popular cultural icon, a favorite certainly of the Academy of Ameri- can Poets, as a writer he has hardly been taken seriously enough. My way of  taking Hughes very seriously has been to read his literary representations of  actual and imagined movements across racial, political, and other cultural  divides as strategies for survival through translation. It is, after all, no coin- cidence that survival is such a frequent topic in his poems and autobiogra- phies and that tropes of survival modulate what might otherwise appear to  be an obsession with death.3 I have argued that knowledge of and for sur- vival was precisely what Hughes wanted to pass on to his readers and that  the extent to which he succeeded in doing so has varied greatly. The degree  to which he failed is perhaps most obvious in his Senate testimonies, but it  is also evident in much academic scholarship on him. Taking the reception  of Hughes’s work beyond the context of the USA gave me a springboard for  tracing in detail how specific texts changed as they were ferried across lin- guistic, cultural, and political borders and acquired literary lives that proved  quite independent of their author. My second precept is that “[a]ll theories are ultimately masks for hidden  diversities,” as Wilson Harris phrased it so succinctly.4 Critical theories in  academia are no exception. To the extent that the afterlives Hughes’s writ- ings attained deserve to be called “world literature,” one might argue that  what I have done in the preceding chapters is put flesh on the bones of the  concept of world literature as something that, in David Damrosch’s words,  is “formed by the interactions of two or more national literatures within a  given cultural space.”5 This is true only to the extent that I imagine Dam- rosch’s given cultural space as the space of translation, which he does  </page> <page sequence="3"> Afterword  223 not. And I do so rather grudgingly, since I see such a space not as given  but as something always under construction—recall Emily Apter’s “in- translation.”6 I also do not regard either Hughes or his Hispanic American  translators as representative of any national literatures. If anything, they  illustrate the fact that not all literary works that fully or partially inhabit  the linguistic space associated with a nation can be unproblematically iden- tified with that nation as a political construct that Wilson Harris would call  a “closed world.”7 A nation is a political construct without a necessarily  coincident cultural entity. Rightly or wrongly, we tend to regard the latter  as changing far more rapidly than the former, which seems to stay relatively  static, changes in geographical borders notwithstanding. Culture pulls at  politics, at institutions of all sorts, while politics tries to bring perceived cul- tural chaos back in line, violently if need be. The trouble that nationalisms  cause, both practically and theoretically, has to do with the fact that the po- litical entities we call nations are indeed never static but change all the time,  both in relation to each other and internally, as previously hardened borders  become ever-more permeable. In response, nations try to limit their citizens’  ability to imagine kinship “beyond a boundary,” as C.L. R. James put it. Literary translations are a case in point, but they are hardly the only  example of texts that interrogate forms of national identity by dwelling in  perpetual homelessness. Repatriation is as much beside the point for trans- lation as it is for any literatures that have multiple points of national origin,  or perhaps none at all. In this regard, I find Ette’s concept of “Literatur  ohne festen Wohnsitz” (literature[s] without a fixed abode) hospitable and  theoretically productive because it “crosses the divide between national lit- erature and world literature with impunity, without being beholden to the  exclusive and exclusionary logic” of either.8 Any viable definition of world  literature(s) for the present and the last century, it seems to me, would have  to be formulated around the conditions of actual and linguistic migrancy  and cultural homelessness rather than exile, a term that has been as over- worked in cultural studies as “hybridity.”9 I also agree with Ette that we  have more than enough spatial concepts by now. What we lack is “a suf- ficiently exact terminology for movement, dynamics, and mobility . . . ways  of rendering more conceptually precise the relations between culture and  language, space and time, medium and discipline.” 10 Yet we are lacking something else in our theories if we are to chart real  movements within real or virtual space and time, in this case the hemi- spheric space of the Americas roughly during the first half of the twentieth  century: we need ways of not screening out the human dimension as that  which produces movement in the first place. What troubles me about both  and indeed most theoretical formulations is the notion that literatures can  somehow interact without human input and agency, clearly a rhetorical  function of the quasi-anthropomorphic investments we make in our objects  of study. Such investments tend to dehumanize most current humanistic  </page> <page sequence="4"> 224  The Worlds of Langston Hughes modes of inquiry—including, ironically enough, Ette’s.11 Despite the fact  that my own scholarly locutions remain implicated in this perhaps unavoid- able dehumanization, at least to some degree, I cannot help but ask where  the lives of authors and readers are in all this. After all, literatures can in- teract precisely because they have readers and because some readers become  authors, translators even, who create texts for different audiences. Books  sit on shelves or, these days, online in silence until someone opens them— brings them, as it were, to life by making them part of her own life. We— professional readers with or without homes in various academies—know  this reflexively, even without having to call to mind the humans-as-books  in Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 (1951) or its recent lackluster cinematic  remake, The Book of Eli (2010). The problem is that we take the act of  reading and the existence of readers as simple givens, much as we take for  granted the unobtrusive workings of translations. It is certainly the case that  “[t]hese days, the practice of translation is culturally taken for granted to  such a degree that its conscious perception requires what the Russian For- malists called a deautomatization. Literary translation is so much a part of  the network of our daily translation activities that we have to make an effort  to recognize its fundamental and, at the same time, exceptional value.”12 To me, the fundamental value of studying literary translation is precisely  such deautomatization. “Thanks to translation,” Octavio Paz writes, “we  become aware that our neighbors do not speak and think as we do”—who- ever our neighbors are.13 Most importantly, then, translation makes us  reconsider common ground too easily assumed or posited. It does so by  drawing attention to degrees of incommensurability, which, according to  Natalie Melas, “[opens] up the possibility of an intelligible relation at the  limits of comparison.”14 That translations, much like critical theories, are to  produce sameness is an expectation whose logic follows the construction of  equivalent value within capitalist economics. The important point here is that  equivalent value, in contrast to what Marx calls “relative value,” seeks to  hide the fact “that some social relation is at the bottom of it.”15 Incommen- surability, however minimal, makes us sit up and take notice of the existence  of social and cultural differences and relations that, if left unnoticed and  unattended, will likely harden into ideological calluses—one possible form  of relation to which one might apply Marx’s term “reification” (Verdingli- chung). Many of them already have. One of the ways of preventing such un- desirable coagulation is to construct provisional, nonhierarchical similarities  that, as Melas (pace Edouard Glissant) rightly proposes, need not unify, at  least not in any totalizing sense. Not all similarities automatically spell same- ness. Like the proverbial devil, degrees of incommensurability in cultural  transfer reside in the details. In comparative literary and cultural studies,  details thus amount to far more than flotsam and jetsam in vast theoreti- cal oceans of “world systems” and “deep time.”16 Whatever the benefits of  Franco Moretti’s “distant readings,” which eschew analytical close-ups and  </page> <page sequence="5"> Afterword  225 make distance “a condition of knowledge,” they cannot help us access the  intricacies of textual details.17 Only close-up readings do, though clearly not  the sort of formalist readings that insist on the aloof autonomy of a literary  work, relegating its historical, political, and cultural situatedness to mere  background noise. Insofar as translation returns our attention to language,  it helps restore a philological dimension to a cultural studies discourse in  which literary analysis has largely been replaced by sociology.18 With Harris, Williams, and Ette foremost in mind, I wrote this book as  a reminder, to myself and to others who profess literature, that we make  far too many unchecked assumptions and take too many things as simple  givens. Our own human and professional identities too often rest in the cat- egory of givens. At the same time, it goes largely unrecognized that all of us  live in other, and others’, words virtually all the time. This is so regardless  of whether we imagine the words we speak and write as awash in large dis- cursive formations that submerge all subjectivity or as speech acts in which  we self-consciously refract all linguistic and discursive conventions. This is  so regardless of the number of languages in which we think, dream, speak,  and write. Like most naturalized USAmerican citizens, I have more than  one language at my disposal, and my scholarly fascination with translation  likely derives in some measure from having lived with and in the sounds and  cadences of several languages for as long as I can remember. The German I  learned as a child was suffused with my grandmother’s Polish phrases and  East Prussian inflections, my mother’s native Russian (though she spoke it  rarely), my father’s occasional Plattdeutsch, a regional dialect, and the English of my parents’ British friends, which in time was to become American- ized and almost more familiar to me than my native tongue. Eighth grade  brought French, recently revived by my work on Alexander von Humboldt,  and graduate school Spanish, not to mention the motley assortment of ver- naculars I inevitably acquired along the way. They have all stuck with me to  varying degrees as (mostly) welcome reminders of the extent to which differ- ent languages, even those believed to be relatively proximate to each other,  often encode cultural knowledge in radically different ways. Living-in- translation, then, amounts to residing in pluriverses that make code switch- ing a modus vivendi. Perhaps unavoidably, self-consciously navigating the flux of linguistic and  discursive differences also creates a peculiar sense of being out of place.  What is original, or native, and what translation blend together in a condi- tion of linguistic homelessness that has complicated cultural consequences.  This sense of homelessness, which is hardly unique to our times, affects all  private and public interactions, among them self-representations and cul- tural identification that frequently do not match socially and profession- ally ascribed identities. For me, being pigeonholed as an American and an  Americanist trained in African American studies speaks to vexations many  share and few acknowledge. </page> <page sequence="6"> 226  The Worlds of Langston Hughes The question of what can and cannot be thought and articulated in dif- ferent languages and discourses extends to academic knowledge production  more broadly. It makes all types of knowledge by definition local and partial,  and it acknowledges untranslatability as a fact. Untranslatability flags gaps  between so-called natural languages and discourses that cannot be closed,  not easily or not at all. Taken to their outer conceptual reaches, these gaps  belie claims to the universality of knowledge that have been passed down  to us from the European Enlightenment.19 Although we (scholars) pay trib- ute to epistemological partiality in theory, practice lags lamentably behind.  For instance, we (Americanists) assume that we all know exactly what we  mean when we speak about English, America, or race, the latter invariably  defaults to black in the USA, the rise of whiteness studies notwithstanding.20  The possibility of gaps in mutual understanding, culturally based mispri- sion, and areas of untranslatability in our disciplinary languages and dis- courses goes largely unrecognized, and when it is acknowledged, it tends  to spark conflict and embarrassment rather than creativity and innovation,  let alone mutual respect. This is a sad state of affairs for a profession that  purportedly values dialogue, certainly more than other sectors of our society  seem to do. I want to wind down my book by sounding the depths of one  particular gap in understanding created by the assumptions that different  Americanists tend to make about the object of their study: is it America or  América? AMERICAN STUDIES, LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES, AND THE AMERICAS The all-too-familiar narrative that equates America with the United States  of America and with whiteness is the centerpiece of the dominant discourse  that Langston Hughes challenges most consistently throughout his writings.  His work reminds us of what we already know but seem at times slow or  reluctant to translate into our own writing: “that the polite fictions render- ing [US]American culture as a series of neighboring cultures hiding behind  masks of legalized racism and racial identification are, in the end, fictions  that in the name of domination have hidden our culture from ourselves.”21  Because of the extent to which that same narrative and the same polite  fictions pervade academia, especially in the USA, they have been a recur- ring concern in this book and throughout my scholarship. The geocultural  space I have privileged here is that of the Americas, or what used to be  called America before that appellation defaulted to the USA. At the same  time, I have also found it necessary—indeed, inevitable—to attend to loca- tions outside this space, such as Spain and the former Soviet Union, to ac- knowledge the global connectedness of what would otherwise appear as an  isolated continental or bicontinental space. My foregoing arguments have  wide-ranging theoretical and methodological implications for the study of  </page> <page sequence="7"> Afterword  227 a cultural and political geography that has been invented and reinvented as  an uneasily shared space ever since that initial moment of Columbus’s mis- recognition we still dub its discovery. From the very start, America has been the result of translational displace- ments. Both the name and what it may signify has been disputed for such  a long time that, perhaps like El Dorado, America has yet to be found. The  adjective “hemispheric,” about which I will have more to say below, encap- sulates my understanding of the basic geography of the Americas as being  composed of South, Central, and North America as well as the Caribbean  archipelago, steering clear of more popular ideological divisions between  America and Latin America—that other America or nuestra América22— or even North and South America. That both binary pairs conspicuously  exclude the Caribbean and always Canada and that not a few citizens of  the USA now believe South America to be inhabited by Mexicans—even  though Mexico, the United States of Mexico, is actually part of North  America—suffices to illustrate just how tricky accepted distinctions are. To  conceptualize the Americas as a singular space does, of course, have it its  problems, even when done heuristically. In no way do I mean to insinu- ate some sort of overarching cultural unity, which exists in this hemisphere  no more than political accord does. Nor does such consensus exist within  individual countries, least of all perhaps in the USA. Yet there are surely  compelling historical reasons for regarding the whole of the postcolonial  Americas, including the USA, as a dynamic network of cultural, political,  and economic forces. Ironically, however, even New Americanists who have  duly scrutinized and criticized the less than admirable part that the USA has  played on this particular stage since the Monroe Doctrine still hold fast to  some version of “American exceptionalism,” the “discourse of incompara- bility” that accompanied the institutional debut of this area of study during  the Cold War.23 The doctrine of exceptionalism that the field of so-called  American studies has espoused since then is, in the end, little more than a  myth, possibly a mirage. Even as a former colony turned empire, the USA is  hardly any more exceptional than its neighbors. From my dual perspective as a comparatist and an (African) American- ist, I see a widening gap between theory and practice in debates about  how American studies—really studies of the USA—might be reshaped, or  “worlded,” in the increasingly ineluctable contexts of globalization.24 In my  estimation, this gap is the result of terminological slippages and conceptual  tautologies that hide a host of assumptions about the role political geog- raphy plays in framing ideas about culture and community. Designations  such as “American studies,” which Djelal Kadir has relabeled “American  American studies” to align it with “Latin American studies,” are part of the  problem.25 If it were not for the fact that certain groups of academic spe- cialists strongly identify with them, I would not use such labels at all, and I  apply them only provisionally. </page> <page sequence="8"> 228  The Worlds of Langston Hughes The notion of a “hemispheric turn” in American studies is a symptom  of the larger problem it seeks to redress.26 USAmerican studies have turned  far too many times in the last few years. There was the linguistic turn, the  cultural turn, and the transnational turn, and since there is a turn for every  season, it is now apparently time for the hemispheric turn. The assump- tion is, of course, that “hemispheric” signifies the Western Hemisphere, also  known as the American Hemisphere, which somehow excludes the parts of  North and West Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, the British Isles, Ireland, and  Antarctica that also lie west of the prime meridian. These turns, which are  typically announced by each incoming president of the American Studies  Association (ASA), do not portend any lasting changes. They are like hang- ing one’s flag with the wind, from whichever direction the breeze happens  to blow. The direction from which the wind has more recently blown—in- deed gusted—in USAcademia is that of globalization and fearful attempts  at internationalization in the wake of 9/11. Unspoken contradictions within  the very fabric of USAmerican studies have reduced attempts at the field’s  meaningful reconceptualization to mere turns. After all, reshaping it would  have to begin with a critical assessment of some key assumptions and fur- ther theorization on the basis of such questioning. The following passage  from a 2007 article by Diana Taylor, director of the Hemispheric Institute  for Performance and Politics at New York University, encapsulates the is- sues with which Hughes grappled in his time and illustrates the extent to  which they continue to vex USAmericanists today. Although scholars throughout the Americas may share certain objects of study,  they seldom share basic assumptions, a common vocabulary, or theoretical  readings. . . . There are problems, always problems, when scholars discuss  America: the topic is huge, much of the terrain well traveled. . . . Worse still,  everyone is sick of this discussion. Many agree theoretically that America is a  misnomer yet continue to use it because there is nothing to be done. America,  however, is more than a misnomer. To colleagues in the south, it is an act of  aggression, an appropriation by people in the United States that excludes other  inhabitants of the landmass. This critique necessarily gets cast as repetitive  whining rather than critical intervention—“necessarily” because if scholars  took the critique seriously, they would have to change their practice.27 In 1994 Carolyn Porter remarked on the very same issue in her program- matic essay, “What We Know That We Don’t Know: Remapping American  Literary Studies,” in which she rightly lamented the “lip service paid to the  severance of the US[A] from its claim of title to America.” According to  Porter, this lip service is not merely a sign of “bad faith” but of nation-based  USAmericanists’ collective “failure” to take seriously the need to transform  their field in word and in deed: “the failure of too many of us to ‘rethink’  what we thought we already knew in the context of what we all know that  </page> <page sequence="9"> Afterword  229 we don’t know.”28 Why, then, have scholars, presumably those to the north,  resisted changing practices that perpetuate an awkwardness that Alexan- der von Humboldt had pinpointed as early as the 1820s? Why are they so  unwilling to inquire into the field’s protocols? Taylor doesn’t say; neither  does Porter. Djelal Kadir, however, is less coy, but his perspective is that  of a literary comparatist. The problem, as he diagnoses it, is that “[t]he America of American Studies . . . becomes the objective correlative of a the- ory strong enough to have functioned as an unimpeachable determinate ide- ology. When theory hardens into ideology, and ideology becomes realized as  pragmatic embodiment, there is no longer any allowable space for further  theorization.”29 Before offering a brief example of how this hardening can play out and  illuminate the practical side of Kadir’s point, I want to clarify that while the  word “America” does have a range of affective connotations for different  users, including academics, it is not the object of study for all scholars in  the Americas but mainly for those who also have a professional investment  in the word itself: that is, those who work in fields whose names include  the adjective “American” in some way. Nor are all those who identify as  either Americanists or Latin Americanists even located in the Americas. In  my experience, the academics with the most deeply held investments in the  word “America” are Americanists at universities located in the USA. One  major reason for this is a conflation of nationality with professional iden- tity. One becomes quite literally unthinkable without the other, and the very  idea of renaming American studies programs to reflect a more hemispheric  scope—or what some USAmericanists see as the Latin Americanization of  their field—seems downright intolerable.30 Unsurprisingly, there are no such  gripes about Canada and the Caribbean, mainly, I suspect, because there are  fewer language differences at issue, or so it seems on the surface. That US- Americanists’ worries are cast in the language of conquest and colonization,  or of colonization in reverse, speaks volumes to the apparent unavailability  of other models for how these fields might relate. The ground for a hemispheric orientation in the New American Studies,  a term coined by Phil Fisher, was prepared in 1990.31 The New American- ists charted a path away from apprehending the putative “uniqueness of the  American experience” (in Perry Miller’s phrasing) and toward studying the  “cultures of United States imperialism.” Yet the contributions to Kaplan  and Pease’s 1993 signature anthology barely even touched on Mexico and  the Caribbean, let alone the rest of the Americas.32 Later publications in this  vein followed and extended the practice of safeguarding the exceptionalism  of the USA by domesticating the issue of empire. Despite claims to different  perspectives and “hemispheric engagement,” essay collections with a hemi- spheric emphasis, such as the 2007 volume Hemispheric American Studies  edited by Caroline Levander and Robert Levine, have ended up in a simi- lar place: that is, “chart[ing] new literary and cultural geographies” results  </page> <page sequence="10"> 230  The Worlds of Langston Hughes merely in a “broader definition of what the US[A] includes.”33 “Carefully  partitioned relations between territory and power,” as Paul Giles has termed  them, remain entirely undisturbed in this scenario.34 While it may be true, at least in part, that the idea of hemispheric Ameri- can studies threatens to disrupt such carefully partitioned relations, as Giles  has claimed, the reality is also that the majority of USAmericanists today are  rather ill prepared for scholarly work on the Hispanic Americas, as I have  preferred to call Latin America to signal at least a partial cultural overlap  with the USA.35 I mean this quite literally: although, regular congressional  attempts notwithstanding, English is not now and has never been the official  language of the United States of America, a surprising number of USAmeri- canists are monolingual. This situation is reinforced either by the absence of  language requirements as part of graduate training or by not taking existing  requirements seriously enough.36 That this English-only monolingualism  extends to many who advocate in favor of broadening American studies  puts in perspective the aversion that specialists on the Hispanic Americas  typically have to the very idea. In theory, they defend their professional  domain against encroachments that they regard as yet another form of aca- demic imperialism. In practice, however, many so-called Latin Americanists  see hemispheric American studies as opening the doors to interlopers who  have none of the requisite linguistic skills to do what they theoretically pro- pose. In this light, the much-debated question of whether American studies  should become hemispheric American studies may be moot, for it is not  clear at all that it can—except perhaps in theory. But it would be an odd  kind of theory, one that precedes and then substitutes for critical practice. Of course, language acquisition in and of itself is not a method, though  area studies have often made it seem that way. For instance, being able to  read literary texts in their original languages does not automatically turn  one into a comparatist, and one should not overvalue linguistic skill at the  expense of scholarly-scientific method. Yet a modicum of linguistic compe- tency in Spanish, Portuguese, and French, which by no means exhaust the  possibilities even for the Americas, is an indispensable prerequisite for any  scholar in any discipline who wants to approach the hemispheric dimen- sions of America meaningfully. It even holds true for those who want to  focus largely on the USA, a country whose realities are hardly monolingual.  Michael Kowalewski has noted that “there has been a healthy and long  overdue recognition that every region of the United States is criss-crossed  by migratory vectors of in and out-migration. Every area of the country  teems with the historical and cultural footprints of multiple populations  (some recent, many long-established over generations)”—some forgotten,  one might add—so that “culture shock can be experienced at home as well  as abroad.”37 Even if it is nearly impossible for midcareer Americanists to  learn the languages they would need to practice hemispheric American stud- ies in good faith, they can at least ensure that their students find themselves  </page> <page sequence="11"> Afterword  231 better positioned. The next generation of USAmericanists—if indeed they  will even be called Americanists—will no longer be able to sidestep the issue  of linguistic competency, and their training must be responsive to this.38 Debates about hemispheric American studies, almost another dispute  about the New World,39 almost invariably frame the contest over America  in terms of a familiar geographical binarism: north and south. Even com- mentators such as Diana Taylor are not immune to the lure of this reductive  logic. Attributing misgivings about the misnomer “America” to “colleagues  in the south,” Taylor makes the “south” the inevitable symbolic location of  resistance to the hegemony of a north that, just as inevitably, defaults to the  USA, which is only implied in the above excerpt from her article. Taylor’s  surprisingly unreflective use of geospatial stereotypes is the rule rather than  the exception among USAmericanists, regardless of whether they regard their  territory as the USA or the Hispanic Americas. Canada and the Caribbean  would further complicate matters, both theoretically and practically. Histori- cally, the north-south binary has provided the impetus for studying foreign  and remote cultures—as a form of ethnography—which, during the early  years of the Cold War, spawned area studies at universities in Europe and the  USA. From a USA perspective, area studies proper do not include American  studies, though they do so everywhere else. Area studies grafted Cold War  political divisions onto the nineteenth-century colonial map of the Western  Hemisphere. Among other things, these divisions solidified the cultural sepa- ration of the USA (as America) from a Latin America invented by the French  to serve its colonial interests. (There were no Romans in the Americas but  certainly descendants of the Gauls.) Literary canons are among the intellectual constructs that have tradi- tionally sustained hemispheric fictions of national or regional imperme- ability. Americanists, mainly historians and literary scholars at the outset,  expounded national exceptionalism in ways consistent with the aspirations  of a global superpower at midcentury. Latin Americanists—many of whom  initially hailed from the USA’s military, where they had worked as inter- rogators, interpreters, and translators during World War II—contributed  heartily to the same goal by providing information about neighboring areas  perceived as potential political trouble spots. The implicit goal of both fields  was to shore up the idea of the nation, or the region, as a distinct linguistic  and, it was assumed, cultural entity.40 As Harry Harootunian maintains,  “regions and areas were simply seen as singularly spatial and often time- less entities that were in the world but were not treated as if they belonged  to it.”41 The disregard for temporality in both fields enabled geographical  areas and the fields of study identified with them to perform as exceptional. Even though the politics of area studies have changed since the early  years of the Cold War—especially in Latin American studies, which has  become much more critical of the USA’s involvement in other parts of the  Americas—the conceptual attachment to holistic cultural communities  </page> <page sequence="12"> 232  The Worlds of Langston Hughes identifiable with geographic locations has remained largely intact. This at- tachment echoes, as Harootunian reminds us, “the older obsession with  extracting an unchanging and essential national character promised by the  study of national literatures and histories.”42 Much like national literature  departments, both USAmerican studies and Latin American studies have  produced their respective exceptionalist narratives and counternarratives  over time, and these narratives tend to reproduce the distinctive ideological  dispositions of their respective objects of study.43 In this scenario, scholarly  work is a matter of defending a priori assumptions about cultural and politi- cal uniqueness and thereby rendering one’s object of study and one’s own  discourse incomparable. This is also one of the paradoxes of comparative  literature, which complicates the role of the truth teller that it has on occa- sion adopted vis-à-vis American studies.44 Sheila Hones and Julia Leyda, two Americanists working at Japanese uni- versities, pinpoint the issue as “a form of spatial fetishism in which people  are reductively identified with particular locations, and the relations between  people are articulated as relations between places.”45 Hones and Leyda’s  challenge is specifically to the “nationally oriented geography” that supports  the idea of a transnational turn in USAmerican studies, which has meant  little else, it seems, than including Americanists based in other countries  in the field’s conversations and forming a separate professional organiza- tion, the International American Studies Association (IASA).46 Once again,  theory and practice diverge sharply. Hones and Leyda argue that notwith- standing all the talk about transnational academic networks and circuits, the  persistent conflation of scholarly with national identity that I noted earlier  “works to naturalize the idea that the US[A]-based Americanist position is  simultaneously domestic and universal while American studies as practiced  elsewhere is by contrast foreign and located.”47 “Naturalization,” then, is  an effect of the USA and its studies being unlocated and unlocatable, that is,  of being a tacit default. As a discursive strategy, this naturalization contains  exogamous perspectives that might undermine the appearance of holism  and transparency in either nationally or regionally defined areas. Such con- tainment of “foreign” perspectives—that is, rhetorical inclusion, practical  exclusion—also accounts for the fact that debates about hemispheric Ameri- can studies as practiced by scholars located in the USA have tended to down- play the importance of a dialogue not only with Latin Americanists but also  with scholars who work on the Americas but in other parts of the world,  including those who do not self-identify as Americanists. It is conspicuous,  and consistent with Hones and Leyda’s argument, that scholarship on the  Americas from elsewhere in the Americas and the world is often ignored in  the USA, especially when it is written in languages other than English. Good intentions notwithstanding, Porter’s above article is not a solution  but symptomatic of the same difficulty. For Porter, reshaping USAmerican  studies would mean to “confront (at the least) a quadruple set of relations  </page> <page sequence="13"> Afterword  233 between (1) Europe and Latin America; (2) Latin America and North Amer- ica; (3) North America and Europe; and (4) Africa and both Americas.”  “The aim here,” she clarifies, “would not be to expand American Studies so  as to incorporate the larger territory of the hemisphere, but rather to grasp  how the cultural, political, and economic relations between and within the  Americas might work to constellate the field itself, reinflecting its questions  in accord with a larger frame. Theoretically speaking, ‘America,’ both geo- politically and historically, would become at once internally fissured and  externally relativized.”48 Compared with what Porter has in mind here, the  hemispheric turn in USAmerican studies constitutes a significant narrow- ing of the aperture, with a focus on internal fissuring through “regional- izing” (Phil Fisher’s term) subspecialties such as African American studies,  Latino studies, Asian American studies, and so forth, as well as privileging  special regions known as contact zones (Mary Louise Pratt) or borderlands  (Gloria Anzaldúa).49 External relativizing, too, has produced its own rup- tures, making hemispheric studies distinct from other transnational studies  in which earlier transoceanic relations focused on USA expatriates and the  Lost Generation have been refigured into trans-Atlantic and, more recently,  trans-Pacific networks.50 Note also that nobody constellates the field. In Porter’s article, the field  somehow creates itself. The same is the case with what Paul Giles calls  “hemispheric knowledge.” “Hemispheric knowledge,” Giles proposes,  “might be said to emerge from a jagged conceptual space where the map of  homeland security is traversed by unfamiliar cartographies.”51 He uses the  metaphorical map of homeland security to refer a larger conceptual prob- lem to a narrow political context: not only the USA but the USA after 9/11.  Giles’s context is limited by place and by being located in the present. It is  unclear, at least to me, why the cartographies that cross-sect this presumably  familiar map are unfamiliar and to whom. If we take these foreign cartog- raphies to represent the perspectives of multiple pasts, presents, and futures,  it becomes evident that what creates the conceptual space’s jaggedness is  movement. Movement in turn introduces the human dimensions that Giles’s  own map lacks, that he elides in the figure of maps traversing each other.  People move; maps do not, certainly not by themselves. People move in time  across geographies and rarely in orderly and predictable fashion. If it is to be  anything, hemispheric knowledge would have to be the knowledge of such  precise movements. Hemispheric American studies cannot produce such  knowledge as long as it merely reproduces and theoretically reenacts “inter- nal fissures and external relations.” The slippage between hemispheric stud- ies and hemispheric knowledge avoids the question of how one can become  the other. What remains unaddressed, and chronically so, is scholarship’s  and scholars’ own forms of movement—what I would call method. Giles’s  stated preference for “an intriguing partiality of perspectives” over what  he calls “new scientific method” makes this evasion surprisingly explicit.52 </page> <page sequence="14"> 234  The Worlds of Langston Hughes What, then, about a method for hemispheric American studies? To my  mind, what compromises the field at the level of methodology is that it pur- ports to combine comparative with interdisciplinary approaches.53 I have  found this virtually impossible to do in my own work, and I have found it  equally unfeasible as part of research groups that form around either com- parative or interdisciplinary agendas, rarely both. Much of the work being  produced under the umbrella of hemispheric American studies falls in the  category of literary studies. So, hemispheric American studies is really hemi- spheric American literary studies. Porter acknowledges this; Giles and many  others do not. The debate about America, then, comes into view as largely  a debate among literary scholars without being acknowledged as such.54  More often than not, “American literary studies” simply slips into “Ameri- can studies,” yet another default. One reason for this may be that, in the  USA, unlike in the UK, for instance, literary studies have become virtually  indistinguishable from cultural studies by virtue of the fact that those who  practice cultural studies in the USA do so typically from the institutional lo- cation of English departments. Why? Because there are precious few Ameri- can studies programs in the USA that can hire their own faculty. This fact  is often repressed, but it returns in the now more frequent descriptions of  American studies as a “discipline.”55 To be clear: an area study is not a discipline. If anything, area studies are  well known for their claims to interdisciplinarity. In fact, interdisciplinarity  used to be a major point of distinction between area studies and the core  humanities and social science departments from which they had sprung:  the national language and literature departments of English and Spanish,  as well as history, political science, and sociology. Once interdisciplinarity- as-cultural-studies became an accepted practice in core departments, these  distinctions began to blur. Today it is de rigueur, and almost tacitly assumed,  that everyone’s work is interdisciplinary, which makes one wonder what is  so bad about literary scholarship and why it has become so unfashionable  in the humanities to admit to working in a single discipline. As Harootunian  again reminds us, such claims should be taken with the proverbial grain of  salt: “Instead of envisaging genuinely interdisciplinary agendas capable of  integrating different disciplines, area studies often settled for the regime  of a simple multidisciplinarism as the sign of a comparative method that  masquerades coverage for the work of comparison, language acquisition  for method, the totality of the nation state for theory.”56 In short, both  USAmerican and Latin American studies have yet to develop coherent inter- disciplinary methods. One might argue that herein lies precisely an opportunity for doing so  jointly in the context of the Americas. In USAmerican studies at least, the  insistence on interdisciplinarity as an incontrovertible reality, rather than  as something to be achieved or even as an ongoing process, has resulted in  the suppression of disciplinary origins as starting points for developing a  </page> <page sequence="15"> Afterword  235 practice that crosses disciplinary lines, call it interdisciplinarity or multidis- ciplinarity.57 Avoiding this issue has led some hemispheric Americanists to  emphasize comparative work but without sufficiently considering that com- parability is not inevitably, and certainly not exclusively, tied to geopolitical  space, be it national or regional.58 The idea of hemispheric American studies  lacks conceptual coherence precisely because it tries to integrate too many  variables without regard to scholarly practice. What might at length pro- duce an integrative methodology—and I am thinking of it not as unified but  as systematic—are intellectual reciprocity and collaboration, practices that  very much tended not to be part of how academics like me have tradition- ally understood their interdisciplinary practice. The chief deficit of what we  consider interdisciplinary work from the vantage point of the humanities is  that it may change the way in which a literary scholar thinks about and ap- plies her own analytical methods, but it does not affect anyone or anything  in, say, anthropology or history. It is a one-way street and as such is vul- nerable to charges of appropriation. Real interdisciplinary practice requires  more than just metaphoric dialogue. Dialogue is the point at which interdis- ciplinarity moves from being a mere discursive effect in a single discipline to  becoming an actual scholarly practice. I can easily imagine similar collabo- rations for comparative work, especially in literary studies, that would be,  among many others things, effective ways of dealing with the linguistic gaps  that divide Americanists from Latin Americanists.59 Translation should play  a more respected and productive role in such situations. None of this, however, is likely to happen as long as we self-identify in ter- ritorial ways as either Americanists or Latin Americanists or allow ourselves  to be categorized along these lines.60 Unless we accept that the knowledges  our respective fields produce are partial formations and that they can be  brought together to work against reductions of difference, even our debates  will remain mired in the allegorical rhetoric of colonization and imperial- ism. This rhetoric generates self-fulfilling prophecies that tell us nothing  about what other possible frames may be obscured by all-too-familiar rep- resentations of political contests within the hemisphere. Politically inspired  allegory offers no possibility for perceiving that vast and diverse area known  as the USA as anything other than the unchanging center of imperial power,  be that power applied for the purposes of internal or external colonization.  By contrast, all other countries in the Americas are then relegated to resist- ing that superpower, and that resistance becomes their sole cultural project. It bears pointing out at this juncture that there are more than just two  Americas. Treating all the different areas, languages, and cultures in what is  best described as a heterotopia as equally limited would go a long way to- ward recovering all the diversities tucked away in scholarly abstractions and  their popular applications. I have tried in this book to open up an analytical  space that is not reducible to the terms and positions of political or cultural  allegory. Nor does it treat literature “as evidentiary symptom of American  </page> <page sequence="16"> 236  The Worlds of Langston Hughes reality.”61 In keeping with this, I want to propose that we reimagine Amer- ica as an area that is not beholden to a single, national or regional, set of  values. In analytical terms, hemispheric America itself might be reframed as  a “thirdspace” (Soja) or a TransArea (Ette), a hetero-topos constituted by  all sorts of simultaneous movements that converge and diverge over time.62  TransArea studies, to adapt Ette’s ideas, would bring together the differ- ent patterns and rhythms produced by the infinitely varied human interac- tions in the hemispheric Americas and connect them with other parts of the  globe. By contrast to transnational studies which retains the concept of the  national even while interrogating it, TransArea studies makes accessible for  critical scrutiny different layers of intra- and intercultural movement for  which the two-dimensional metaphor of border crossing is inadequate.63  We can analyze how these movements converge with and diverge from lin- guistic and other cultural differences at particular moments in space-time.  The knowledge of these sorts of multilayered, motile interactions advances  our collective understanding of how the lingering construct of the nation- state, along with definitions of “area” solely predicated on geography, dis- torts our perceptions of what appear to be static delimiters and guarantors  of individual and collective identities. That such delimiters can and do shift,  however subtly, is precisely what makes translation so immensely valuable  for hemispheric American literary and cultural studies. TRANSLATION AND DIASPORA My goal throughout this book has been to work against theoretical reduc- tions of cultural differences by presenting historical and textual evidence  in place of the “imagined ahistorical otherness” through which, George  Handley reminds us, academics tend to “fantasize” both national and in- ternational communities.64 We cannot cross borders in theory and yet re- tain as safety nets ideas about linguistic and cultural groups based on the  nineteenth-century nation-state, however strategic those idea may be under  certain post- and neocolonial circumstances. Regardless of when and where  they occur, or from which disciplinary perspective they are theorized, con- cepts such as border crossing and contact zones must in the end give way to  critical practices through which hypotheses about how cultural spaces are  shared and disputed on a hemispheric and global scale can be tested rather  than merely applied. Testing theories can and will yield new metaphors, and  there is a dire need for those in any language. Peter Hulme, for instance,  urges “imaginative mass trespass over the established boundaries of literary  history.”65 Ottmar Ette offers Konvivenz, a Latinate neologism in German  that, to me at least, loses its compelling gravitas in the giddiness of the Eng- lish “conviviality” that Paul Gilroy proposes.66 Brent Edwards suggests the  French décalage (a difference or gap in either time or space) to underwrite  </page> <page sequence="17"> Afterword  237 “a subtly innovative model with which to read the structure of such uneven- ness in the African diaspora.”67 African diaspora studies, more recently called black internationalism, re- mains an important framework for Hughes and his Afro-Hispanic American  interlocutors. The constitutive multilingualism of black internationalism not- withstanding, the transatlantic theorizing that has been so vital to critiques  of modernity in Europe and the USA is, however, still based almost exclu- sively on materials written in English. An unfortunate effect of the privileg- ing of North Atlantic configurations in Paul Gilroy’s influential The Black  Atlantic (1993) and much of the work that has followed in its footsteps has  been to eclipse the entire southern part of the Western Hemisphere, includ- ing, of course, the Hispanic parts of the Caribbean.68 That English-speaking  Guyana, the former home of Wilson Harris, has been the sole South Ameri- can exception to the rule shows just how major a role linguistic factors have  played in the formation of late-twentieth-century diasporic theories that  have relegated Afro- and Asian-Hispanic American cultures to a position of  virtual insignificance. Recent scholarship on black internationalism in other  languages, notably French, has started to challenge the unifying generaliza- tion about shared literary (and cultural) experience derived from trans- and  circum-Atlantic theories.69 Brent Edwards deserves much credit for attend- ing closely to the potentially “adversarial” varieties of “black expression”  across languages.70 So do David Chioni Moore and Kate Baldwin, who, in  their work on Langston Hughes in the former Soviet Union, have also con- tributed to moving Atlanticism “beyond anglophone archipelagoes and [re- sisting] the continental confines of a Europe-Africa-US[A] triangulation.”71  Their work and that of others shows the vital role that translation has played  in mediating the specific relations among the writers of the African diaspora. TRANSLATION AND LITERARY INFLUENCE Translation studies also has broad ramifications for literary and cultural  studies, especially when we think of translation as a vehicle for so-called  literary influence on a global scale. All the major models of literary influ- ence we use today, in diaspora studies and elsewhere, are still of a piece  with the theoretical concepts Harold Bloom developed in The Anxiety of  Infl uence (1973) through his readings of British Romantic poetry, which  he extended in subsequent studies to the work of other poets, all of whom  wrote in English. Translation has had no place in such models, except as a  metaphor for intertextuality. Literary translation studies have not helped  matters by privileging those cases in which both “primary” and “second- ary” aesthetic functions converge in the same person, that of writer-transla- tor. For modernist studies, this figure has most frequently, and most ideally,  been embodied in Ezra Pound.72 Outside such felicitous convergences,  </page> <page sequence="18"> 238  The Worlds of Langston Hughes translation as a literary practice is typically ignored. To wit, the figure of the  literary translator has only recently begun to recover from her prolonged  condition of invisibility and to be grudgingly released from long-standing  charges of treason.73 The question of what claims to authorship, and thus  to a special form of cultural authority, a translator might have is, however,  far from resolved. Poets and novelists are rarely also translators; nor is the mere fact of  translation tantamount to literary influence. In the case of Hughes, there is  virtually no overlap between the writers whom Hughes’s poems may have  influenced—among them Nicolás Guillén, Pilar Barrios, and Manuel Za- pata Olivella—and those who actually translated his poems for publication.  Regardless of similar divergences in other cases, countless studies have, for  instance, belabored Gabriel García Márquez’s influence on Toni Morrison  and Faulkner’s influence on García Márquez, Juan Rulfo, and other “Boom”  novelists, without adding into the equation the fact that these writers most  likely read each other in translations by, among others, Gregory Rabassa,  Margaret Sayers Peden, and in Faulkner’s case Jorge Luis Borges. Even in  the occasional grumblings about “bad” translations that come from spe- cialists in Hispanic American literatures who find their academic territory  invaded by comparatists, the fact that literary influence often occurs as the  result of a specific translation, be it “good” or “bad,” is rarely addressed.  Nor does a writer’s level of linguistic competence ever enter into such dis- cussions, any more than does a translator’s role as a cultural mediator who  often plays more than just second fiddle. Literary influence also does not work in exactly the same way in multilin- gual situations as it is believed to function in monolingual ones. Although  the Bloomian model of creative misprision has been applied to other liter- ary contexts both national and comparative,74 it has not been sufficiently  rethought for situations in which writers depend on translations to access  texts written in other languages. The workings of influence across languages  are messy because the texts that are subject to misprision are rarely so-called  originals. This means that any comparison of texts by writers who neither  work in nor read shared languages has to take account of translation as a  complicating theoretical factor. While I agree that translations “are not a  reliable index of cultural difference,” any more than they are an unfailing  guide to cultural similarities,75 studying literature in translation points us to  important cultural differences within superficial sameness. Being attentive  to such differences, however minute they may be, is especially important for  comparatists who work with international settings already inscribed with a  host of assumptions about, and indeed expectations of, cultural or ideologi- cal unity, even in the midst of glaring local differences. This is as true of  African diaspora studies as it is of modernist studies. We have to be wary of  those assumptions and the simplifications that follow all too readily in their  wake, lest we let the mere appearance of sameness get in the way of evidence  that would suggest otherwise. </page> <page sequence="19"> Afterword  239 SURVIVAL AND THE HUMANITIES Using translation studies and reception history as a vehicle for literary his- tory, I have shown that the English and Spanish versions of Hughes’s work  are as much a part of the loosely spun fabric of global modernisms as the  writings of both more and less canonical figures in the Western Hemisphere.  Most importantly, a literary history that focuses on translation as “the most  creative form of active reception”76 changes the composition and texture of  that fabric, bringing into relief previously unnoticed patterns and dimen- sions. Such patterns emerge when one connects points in time and space  where the trajectories of literary vanguards intersect and overlap with the  entangled routes of black internationalism, global socialism, and postcolo- nialism. This book should not, however, be understood as merely another  call for greater inclusivity. To be sure, including Langston Hughes and other  as yet unrecognized writers from the Americas in the modernist canon that  the New Critics and their disciples constructed to wall literature off from  the sociopolitical pressures of the Cold War might close certain gaps in  modernism’s literary history. Greater inclusivity alone does not alter basic  conceptual and emotional templates, let alone shift intellectual paradigms  with deep ideological roots in the plantation tradition.77 Adding another name to a roster changes nothing about the hierarchies of  selves and others that most of us still wear like a pair of comfortable shoes.  My point in calling Hughes a fringe modernist is to stress, as I have done  throughout, that the cultural authority of the so-called margins has been  profoundly underestimated and that existing narratives of marginalization  may actually prevent us from appreciating this fact.78 What is so valuable  about Hughes’s work is the dogged elegance with which his words refuse to  let his readers tread easily in their well-worn habits, be those racist, classist,  or sexist. Thinking about the margin as disenfranchised and about African  American writers as victims is one of those habits, and it seems rather urgent  that we in the academies of the world think long and hard about why it is  comfortable to think so. Hughes is fundamentally a writer who keeps us on  our toes, perpetually pushing the limits of our own culturally bounded as- sumptions, expectations, and academic master narratives. Langston Hughes is an African American writer from the USA, a black  internationalist, and an international modernist. When a writer occupies all  three of these positions at once—and many writers do—it becomes diffi- cult to justify why one would conceptually, historically, or methodologically  privilege any one position in analyzing his or her writings. As I hope I have  shown in this book, what is needed to describe the spatiotemporal cross- roads at which these discursive formations, along with the writers them- selves, meet is a carefully calibrated comparative approach that can test out  critical theories and scrutinize the abstractions that articulate them. Such an  approach helps us see the separation of high modernism and black or ethnic  literature in the Americas for what it is: a simple mechanism of segregation.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 240  The Worlds of Langston Hughes Among the academic segregationists are not just the New Critics and their  heirs but also African Americanists who claim that modernism, be it Euro- American or Hispanic American, has no significance for or connection with  African American literatures, presumably because those literatures lack “the  depersonalizing/hyperpersonal contradiction at the core of modernism.”79 Ultimately this book is about rejecting segregation in all its manifesta- tions, inside and outside academia, which strikes me as especially vital at a  time when it is altogether unclear whether and how the humanities will sur- vive at universities. We as humanities scholars need to drawn on the work  of the writers whom we profess to admire as resources for shaping and ar- ticulating our own survival strategies. Part of my own tactic is to challenge  concepts that are inherently divisive, in my scholarship and in the way I live.  If reading Langston Hughes has taught me anything, it is that differences  need not divide—either in literature or in life. </page> </plain_text>
