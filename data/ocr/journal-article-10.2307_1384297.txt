<plain_text><page sequence="1">MYTHOLOGICAL-SYMBOLIC RELIGIOUS COMMITMENT: THE LAM SCALES RICHARD A. HUNT Department of Psychology Soathern Methodist University The LAM scales permit the measurement of three religious meaning-commitment pos- sibilities (Literal, Anti-literal, and Mythological) rather than the usual fundamentalistic- literalistic type of commitment which many single scales tend to measure. Twenty-five items consisting of three alternatives each, based upon McLean (1952), were given to 173 college students. The LAM scales consist of the 17 items which were retained on the basis of substantial item-scale correlations of each item alternative on its respective scale. Ways are discussed in which multiple scales like the LAM would force reinterpretation of studies of religious changes in college students and of research on the relation of religion to social- personality variables such as prejudice and hostility. A persistent flaw in studies of religious belief and commitment is the bias of the measuring instruments toward a literal-fundamentalistic interpretation of Protestant Christianity. This literal-fundamentalistic bias, although not deliberate in most instances, results from the way in which measuring instruments are typically constructed with a single statement to which the subject must respond with true-false, agree-disagree, or other variations of these essentially unidimensional response formats. Some of the issues which underlie this methodological problem of the disjunction between theological conceptualization and empirical measurement of religious commit- ment have been succinctly stated by Dittes. "What is your attitude toward the church?" Well, the church . . . is a divine institution, God's chosen instrument for the salvation of men; and the church is a self-serving institu- tional sham impeding men's search for spiritual salvation. The same man, whether he be Kierkegaard or Bonhoeffer or Tillich or Rahner or Brunner or the Niebuhrs, in effect chooses items from opposite ends of a Thurstone scale. . . . The church, conceptualized as it is really meant to be, is affirmed. But the church, as it is manifested in ways that researchers and others assume to manifest these conceptions, is repudiated (Dittes, 1969, p. 68). Unknowingly, the researcher has already included in the items of his scale implica- tions and assumptions relating to hermeneutics, exegesis, teleology, eschatology, ontology, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics and metaethics, and many more theological and philo- sophical fields. It is rare for the researcher to ask his respondents how they perceived his favorite item statements. It is even more unusual for scientific researchers to col- laborate in extended depth with equally well-qualified theologians and philosophers in editing statements about religion to provide a sample of the full range of theological and philosophical positions in his inventory. 42</page><page sequence="2">MYTHOLOGICAL-SYMBOLIC COMMITMENT: LAM SCALES 43 This weakness in construct validity (French &amp; Michael, 1966) of paper-and-pencil measures of religiosity, then, results from the multiplicity of meanings which the re- spondent can attach to the same inventory item (especially along the religious-secular or latent-manifest dimensions as discussed by Dittes, 1969), whereas the researcher has typically exercised a simplistic bias, constructing a series of doctrinal statements with the assumption that those who disagree with these statements are lacking in religious com- mitment. This literal-fundamentalistic interpretation pervades most of the items and scales in the collections of Thurstone and Chave (1939) and of Shaw and Wright (1967). The present paper has two purposes. The first purpose is to describe a mythological- symbolic measure of religion which is independent of a literal-fundamentalistic measure of religion. The second purpose is to suggest two major areas in which such a scale would make important differences in results and interpretations of empirical data. DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAM SCALES The basic assumption of this study is that religion as a "conservative-liberal" dimen- sion, though frequently confounded with, should be distinguished from a "literal-sym- bolic" (or mythological) dimension involving usage of religious language. Popular polarizations tend to equate "conservative" with "literal" and "liberal" with "symbolic." However, it would be possible, for example, for a person to be quite "liberal" in the sense of desiring social reforms yet be very "literal" in permitting only one interpretation of a given doctrine or statement. Here "literal-symbolic" is a language dimension assumed to be different from the "conservative-liberal" continuum of religious doctrine. But as a person becomes less literal and rigid in his religious perspective, the structure of most questionnaires provides no alternative except for him to appear less religious as shown by a lower score on a scale which permits only "agree or disagree" with statements which reflect a conservative or traditional interpretation of doctrines and practices. The LAM scales (Literal, Anti-literal, and Mythological) were developed to represent three basic "meaning-commitment" possibilities. First, an individual may commit himself to a literal interpretation of religion in which he takes at face value any religious state- ment without in any way questioning it. This literal position may reflect an individual who has not examined the relation of his religious statements to other cognitive, conative, and affective areas of his life. Second, an individual may, on the basis of a literal, naive, unexamined interpretation of religion, reject all religion as being of no value to him or the world. This anti-literal person may be rebelling against limited childhood religious teaching and restrictive teachers (including parents) in a manner similar to the adolescent rejection of parental authority as one aspect of his search for his own identity. This may also represent the individual who for other reasons rejects all Christian-oriented interpretations of life. The third commitment possibility is a reinterpretation of religious statements to seek their deeper symbolic meanings which lie beyond their literal wording. This person's religious framework is more complex and capable of assimilating both the intention of religious orthodoxy and the realities of the contemporary world. For most moderate to</page><page sequence="3">44 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION liberal Christian groups, this may be considered to be the most mature type of commit- ment. The scales were derived from the original McLean (1952) scale of 25 items and his agree-disagree answer format. Three alternatives were developed for each LAM item stem. Each alternative began with the word "agree" or "disagree" followed by a statement of the reason for the answer. Subjects were asked to respond by ranking each set of three alternatives according to the extent to which each expresses his personal opinion. The 25 items and their scale designations are presented in the appendix. As a check on the religious literal scales being constructed, it was desired to compare results with a (non-religious) scale of literalness which had already been carefully re- searched. The Religious World Views Scale (McLean, 1952) was selected for this pur- pose. It was assumed that the LAM Literal scale would be positively related to the RWV and that the LAM Anti-literal scale would be negatively related to the RWV. The original McLean Religious World Views (RWV) scale and the LAM scales were administered to 88 male and 85 female undergraduate students enrolled in seven classes at Southern Methodist University. In each class half of the students completed the RWV first and then the LAM, while the other half of the class had the reverse order. RESULTS RELATION OF RWV TO LAM The hypothesis that the L and A scales measure the same type of verbal religious commitment as the RWV was supported. The RWV correlated +.73 with the L scale and -.74 with the A scale. The hypothesis that the M scale would be unrelated to the RWV scale was also supported by a correlation of - .10 between these two scales. COMPARISON OF LAM SCORING METHODS Method 1: A weight of 2 was assigned for each first choice of a given scale alternative in an item set and a weight of 1 for each second choice in that set ("2-1-0" method). Thus the three scales are ipsative with a total of three points to be distributed among each triad, making 75 points to be distributed among the three scales. Method 2: In an alternative scoring method ("1-0-0" method), the first choices only received a weight of 1, providing a total of 25 points to be distributed among the three scales. This eliminated the contribution of the second choice alternative to the total score. A comparison of the two types of scoring resulted in two important findings. First, the correlation between the pairs of alternatively scored scales was consistently high (r .94 for L, r = .97 for A, r = .95 for M) which is consistent with other findings (Nun- nally, 1967). Second, the "2-1-0" method produced a significant negative correlation between the L and A scales of -.76, and a correlation of -.22 between the L and M scales. (Since the scales are ipsative, the equivalent of a .00 correlation is approximately -.55 with a range of approximately -.73 to -.36 at the p &lt; .01 level. Thus the r of -.22 actually represents a small positive correlation between the L and M scales.) With</page><page sequence="4">MYTHOLOGICAL-SYMBOLIC COMMITMENT: LAM SCALES 45 the "1-0-0" scoring method, the intercorrelations between the three scales were not sta- tistically significant (range -.41 to -.56). For this reason the remainder of the analysis is based upon the results from the "1-0-0" scoring method. SCALE HOMOGENEITY In an initial analysis of the total group, internal consistencies of the three 25-item scales were cakulated using Gulliksen's variance-covariance procedure (Gulliksen, 1950; Hunt, 1969). These reliabilities (homogeneity or internal consistency) were .87 for the L scale, .92 for the A scale, and .77 for the M scale. In a subsequent analysis, the sample of 173 was divided into two equal groups by placing the odd numbered cases in one group and the even numbered cases in the other group, thus providing for cross-validation of the scales. An item-scale analysis was performed on each sub-group using the results of the item-scale analysis of the other group. Seventeen questions (indicated by asterisk in the appendix) were selected for the final form of the scales on the basis of each alter- native of each question correlating highly with its respective scale. Scale means, standard deviations, homogeneities, and median item-scale correlations are presented in Table 1. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES Table 2 displays the means and standard deviations for males and females in each of the two groups for the seventeen item scales. None of the differences between sexes on any of the LAM scales is statistically significant.

DISCUSSION The statistical analyses of these LAM scales indicates that this seventeen item set of ipsative scales will yield independent scores for literal and symbolic interpretations of religion. These scales seem to be limited to the Christian framework for interpreting religion. The A (Anti-religious) scale serves to provide a response measure for those who do not agree with either literal or symbolic interpretations of religion. It seems</page><page sequence="5">46 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION TABLE 2 Distribution of 17 item LAM Scores for Males and Females Literal Anti-religious Mythological Males (N = 88) Mean: 3.6 4.7 8.1 SD: 4.2 4.8 4.2 Females (N = 85) Mean: 3.1 3.3 10.0 SD: 3.4 3.9 3.9 that the A scale is probably measuring the extent of negative reaction to a literal inter- pretation of religion, since it is negatively correlated with the L scale and uncorrelated with the M scale. Thus three rather clear positions regarding religion may be dis- tinguished with these scales. MEASURING COMMITMENT TO SYMBOLIC RELIGION The LAM scales will permit the measurement of commitment to literal, anti-literal, and symbolic approaches to a Christian interpretation of religion. This methodology can probably be applied to religious traditions other than Christian since their teachings and literature may also be interpreted from either literal or symbolic perspectives. Undoubt- edly there are other types of mythological-symbolic-secular religious commitment in addi- tion to that represented in this questionnaire (Dittes, 1969). The symbolic approach to religion may also be related to the complexity of cognitive functioning, education, age, or to other characteristics of individuals. Rather than speculate upon how a symbolic di- mension develops, possible applications of these scales or extensions of this methodology, a critical examination of two areas of research will suggest the importance of utilizing some type of symbolic measure of religion in research. RELIGIOSITY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS One of the areas in which exclusive use of measures of literal-fundamentalistic re- ligious commitment has been made is in the studies of changes in the religiosity of college students. Feldman (1969, 1970) has provided an excellent review of studies of the effects of college on religious commitment and values. However, as he notes in his report, research on such changes in college students is ultimately dependent upon the validity of the measuring instruments. Feldman notes that these studies are plagued by the problems of possible multi- dimensionality of religiosity scales and by the masking of individual changes through the use of group means for comparison of groups. Numerous studies have used the Ailport- Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values to compare freshmen-senior changes. In these studies, "'nearly without exception aesthetic values are of higher relative importance to seniors whereas Allport-Vernon-Lindzey religious values are of lower importance" (Feldman, 1969, p. 42). Some differences in Study of Value religious scale scores among students with various majors in college have also been found (Feldman, 1970). Since the Study of Values religious scale seems to be a measure of assent to rather literal statements of traditional Protestant Christian doctrines and habits (Hunt, 1968), if seniors score lower on this type of measure of religious commitment, this does not necessarily mean that they are less religious, but only that they are less likely to assent to a literal interpretation of</page><page sequence="6">MYTHOLOGICAL-SYMBOLIC COMMITMENT: LAM SCALES 47 traditional religious statements. That such is the case is strongly suggested by Feldman's summary statements. These studies, too, generally show that seniors, as a group, are somewhat less likely to believe in God and more likely to be indifferent or opposed to religion, somewhat more likely to conceive of God in impersonal terms, somewhat less orthodox or fundamentalistic in religious orientation, and somewhat more religiously "liberal." There are, however, a number of items showing no differences between seniors and freshmen, and a few reveal net religious changes in directions that are the reverse of those just given (Feldman, 1969, p. 44). A large number of studies have shown that between their freshman and senior year college students on the average come to attach less importance to religious values, become more skeptical about God, the church, and religious activities, and become less religiously orthodox and fundamentalistic. . There is no one general area of attitude and value change during college in which change is uniformly in one direction for all students. However, within this multi-directionalty of change, religious changes are more likely to be multi-directional than changes in almost any other area (Feldman, 1970, p. 122). The impact of the studies reviewed by Feldman is that college students seem to be- come less literal-fundamentalistic in their religious views. It is not clear, however, whether this means that they (1) are more negative to religion, (2) are interpreting religious statements in a more sophisticated manner, (3) have incorporated behaviors and goals which would be supported by most Protestant groups (such as family and career goals, Feldman, 1969) but which are not explicitedly identified as "religious," or (4) are not given sufficient options in a forced-choice format to express their interpreta- tions of the items adequately. Because the literal, anti-literal, and symbolic dimensions are indiscriminately mixed into current research scales for measuring religion, the precise meaning of measured changes in college students' religious commitment remains am- biguous and indefinable. Such ambiguities exist in the majority of researches on change in students' religious commitments (for example, Arsenian, 1943; Jacob, 1957; Hites, 1965). In spite of considerable research, we still do not know how the religious com- mitment of college students changes across their college experience. LANGUAGE, BEHAVIOR, AND PRACTICAL DECISIONS There is a second major area in which more adequate measures of symbolic approaches to religion would radically change current research findings and interpretations. This area concerns the use of language in paper-and-pencil measuring instruments for studying religious behavior, and the role which these types of research results should occupy in practical decisions. The majority of "empirical" measures of religious commitment are actually verbal self-reports (however well designed). There is a place for such research, but it is only one of several possible research strategies (Shontz, 1965; Kleinmuntz, 1967). Although paper-and-pencil measures may be considered as a type of verbal behavior (Cronbach, 1970), they are at least one step removed from and not necessarily correlated with actual real life behavior, which is announced as the focus of research on religion. Some im- provement is gained through relating paper-and-pencil measures as independent variables to observations of ongoing behavior in structured situations, such as clinical interviews (for example, Allen &amp; Spilka, 1967; Stewart, 1967).</page><page sequence="7">48 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Philosophical analyses of religious language (for example, Moreau, 1961; Ferre, 1968; High, 1969) demonstrate the complexities facing any researcher who attempts to develop a scale to measure religion. Binkley (1962) and Hick (1962) have described eight ways in which religious language can be used (empirical, tautological, emotive, cere- monial, prescriptive, mythical, paradoxical, and metaphysical). These types of religious language are typically confused and confounded in most paper-and-pencil measures of religiosity (for example, Wilson, 1960; Feagin, 1964; Allport, 1954, 1966; Allport &amp; Ross, 1967; Glock &amp; Stark, 1966; Stark &amp; Glock, 1968; Rokeach, 1969). Each is pre- sumably related differently to behavioral expressions of religion. The verbal plurality compounds the problem of the validity of verbal measures. The same questions of validity must also be asked about paper-and-pencil measures of prejudice, hostility, values, and other social-personality variables. Statistically signifi- cant differences among groups on the basis of an invalid measure of religion, or of its correlates, are at best meaningless and at worst, dangerous and misleading. Both Stark (1970, p. 152) and Rokeach (1970, p. 157, 161) assert that their goals are to have changes made in society on the basis of their research findings based on self- report verbal statements. One may fully agree with the emphasis of Rokeach upon the need for a more positive "role of organized religion in contemporary American society" and at the same time request researchers to improve their crude measuring instruments so as to distinguish among types of religious meaning and response (Spilka, 1970), a re- quest which Rokeach tends to ignore. I believe that an analysis of religious complexity or types of personal religious belief is irrelevant to the sociological question about the role of organized religion in society.... The larger and more important question is: Does organized religion produce more of the "phony" type (extrinsic, consensual) or the "real" type of religious person (intrinsic, committed)? . . . My data and data by many others suggest that organized religion pro- duces more of the "phony" type. Spilka's suggestion that I ought to be more concerned with the complexity of personal religion diverts attention away from the sociological question I wish to ask: Of what use is organized religion to society? (Rokeach, 1970, p. 157). To prescribe remedies for religion and/or society on the basis of paper-and-pencil measures of religion is premature and almost certain to be erroneous, due to the wide use of unidimensional scales and simplistic criteria whose validities are largely unknown. The LAM scales offer the possibility of taking a small step toward overcoming some of these difficulties.</page><page sequence="8">MYTHOLOGICAL-SYMBOLIC COMMITMENT: LAM SCALES 49 APPENDIX 2. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth. L 1. Agree, since available evidence proves that God made everything. A 2. Disagree, since available evidence suggests some type of spontaneous creation for which it is unnecessary to assume a God to create. M 3. Agree, but only in the sense that this is an anthropomorphic way of talking about whatever Process, Being, or Ultimate Concern stands behind the creative process. 3. I believe that men working and thinking together can build a just society without super- natural help. L 1. Disagree, since man without God's help can do very little that is good. A 2. Agree, since men have and are increasing the ability and technical knowledge to improve society if they will apply this knowledge to the problems of society. M 3. Disagree, although men's ability and technical knowledge is increasing, they must build on the ultimate power within oneself [sic] to understand and accomplish the full implications of justice and a good society. 4. The writings of such commentators on human life as Plato, Aristotle, Dante, and Shakespeare are as much inspired as are the writings of Moses and Paul. L 1. Disagree, because the writings of Moses and Paul contain a special inspiration from God which other human writings do not have. A 2. Agree, since there is really little difference in these writings. In fact, Plato and Aristole may be even more important for us than Moses and Paul. M 3. Disagree, although any writing may be inspired, the writings of Moses and Paul are especially significant because they form part of the revelation of God in history. 5. All miracles in the Bible are true. L 1. Agree, because the Bible cannot contain any false report of God's work. A 2. Disagree, since "miracles" can be explained by our modern understanding of the principles by which nature and human society operate. M 3. Agree, but only in the sense that "miracles" are a dramatic report and interpretation of a natural process, with the literary purpose of pointing to the sovereignty of God. They are probably not factually accurate. M* *4. Perhaps, since there is considerable evidence for extra-physical power used by a few persons in every major cultural tradition, though there is no clear scientific proof. 9. Jesus was born of the Virgin in a manner different from human beings. A 1. Disagree, although most religions claim a virgin birth for their founder, we know that such an event is physically impossible. M 2. Agree, but only in the sense that this is an ancient mythological way of talking about the Ultimate Reality as manifested in Jesus. L 3. Agree, since God conceived Jesus in Mary's womb before she had sexual relation- ship with Joseph, her husband. 11. The attempt to believe in a supernatural being is a sign of a person's failure to accept respons- ibility for his own life. A 1. Agree, since belief in God is usually an escape from the problems of everyday life. Such belief does nothing to help solve one's problems. L 2. Disagree, because belief in God is really the only way in which man can be saved and make his life worthwhile. M 3. Disagree, since belief in God is basically man's way of talking about his full accept- ance of personal responsibility in the face of ultmate and sometimes uncertain reality. 12. I believe in the guidance of the Holy Spirit. L 1. Agree, since God has said that he will be with us always. Prayer thus is an effective way of listening to God's guidance. A 2. Disagree, since the supernatural, if it exists at all, is in no way directly involved in telling man what to do. M 3. Agree, because this is one way of describing the involvement of God with his crea- tion and man. 13. The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever. L 1. Agree, since God created man and expects man to do God's will at all times. A 2. Disagree, since man must find his own purposes in life. There are probably no purposes for man which are apparent in nature. M 3. Agree, because the essential purpose of God is that man achieve his own maximum fulfillment through personal development and service to others. M**4. Agree, since the individual who enjoys God's creation and serves his fellow man is at the same time glorifying God.</page><page sequence="9">50 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION 14. I believe Hell is a form of existence in a future life. M 1. Disagree, since Hell is not a future life existence, but rather a present state in this life which occurs when man disregards his own code of ethics and/or the rights of other individuals. A 2. Disagree, since there is little, if any, evidence for any type of existence after this life. L 3. Agree, since there is ample evidence in the Bible and other authoritative sources for Hell as a form of future existence. 15. The four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, contain some legendary materials. A 1. Agree, since most of the material in the gospels cannot be supported by other historical sources or is not relevant to life in today's world. L 2. Disagree, since nothing in the four gospels could be legendary or in error, because these are part of the Bible and therefore infallible. M 3. Agree, but this does not deny the basic purpose of the gospels, which is to use written language (however inadequate) to announce God's revelation of himself to man. 17. We were made for fellowship with God and our hearts are restless until they rest in him. M 1. Agree, although this is merely a way of talking about the ultimate nature of man's activities as being in some way related to God's purposes. A 2. Disagree, since man's restlessness results from his inability to identify with a group of persons and enjoy people about him, not in a supposed relation to some God. L 3. Agree, since God's basic purpose in creating man is so that man can be a companion to God. 18. Man is saved by the free gift of God's grace. L 1. Agree, since the Bible clearly states that salvation is by man's faith in God and his grace. A 2. Disagree, since whatever salvation there is must come through man's work in the world about him. M 3. Agree, since this is a traditional expression which really refers to the unconditional nature of God's grace toward man. 19. The biblical writers were endowed with a divine wisdom which enabled them to foretell specific events in the distant future. M 1. Disagree, since the basic purpose of prophecy in the Bible was to announce God's judgment of the ways in which that present generation failed to act in harmony with God's purposes for man. L 2. Agree, since many of these prophecies either came true in earlier history, in the Bible, or are coming true in the world today. A 3. Disagree, since the biblical writers had no greater wisdom than other men of their day. Any prophecies which may have come true were the result of a knowledge of cause and effect which any man could achieve. 21. Man is ultimately responsible to God. A 1. Disagree, because man is finally responsible only to himself and his society. M 2. Agree, because this is a way of describing the basic assumption upon which all other concepts of responsibility depend. L 3. Agree, because God has created man in his image and expects man to do God's will. 22. God is only a symbol of man's ideals. M 1. Disagree, although man's experiences may be symbolized in his image of God, the reality of God always transcends man's symbols for that reality. A 2. Agree, since religious men tend to ascribe to God their own highest ideals. L 3. Disagree, since there is clear evidence for a real God who is much more than just the result of man's rational powers. 23. Jesus walked on water and raised the dead. A 1. Disagree, since these are probably exaggerated reports of events which could be ex- plained through our knowledge of nature. L 2. Agree, since there are several accounts in which Jesus actually brought a physically dead person back to life. These accounts provide evidence for God's power over nature. M 3. Agree, but only in the sense that these are figurative ways of describing man's aware- ness of the meaning of life in relation to the revelation of God. 24. The biblical story of creation is probably based on one of the early Babylonian myths. M 1. Agree, but the basic purpose of the creation story is to symbolize God's creative and redemptive relation to the universe and to man. L 2. Disagree, since the biblical story of creation has not been duplicated in any way at any time. It refers to God's creation of the world and man. A 3. Agree, since most religions provide such a creation story. Modern scientific theories of the origin of the universe have replaced these ancient accounts.</page><page sequence="10">MYTHOLOGICAL-SYMBOLIC COMMITMENT: LAM SCALES 51 REFERENCES Allen, Russell 0. and Bernard Spilka 1967 Committed and consensual religion: A specification of religion-prejudice relationships.
