<plain_text><page sequence="1">372 BOOK LIST which he dates in the New Kingdom and thinks were probably the work of Canaanite metal workers; E. D. Oren on the "Ways of Horus", the trade route from Egypt to Asia along the Mediterranean coast of the Sinai Peninsula; and Trude Dothan on Egyptian influence on Canaan in the 18th and 19th Dynasties in the light of excavations at Deir el-Balah, south of Gaza. D. B. Redford argues that the account of the exodus in the book that bears that name "is a post-Exilic composition which, in the absence of genuine historical detail, was obliged to draw on contemporary toponymy"; instead, he finds behind the biblical story a tradi- tion based on "the Hyksos descent into and occupation of Egypt" (p. 150). The essay is more a stimulus to further thought than convincing in either its positive or all its negative conclusions. In contrast, M. Bietak argues for the identification of Pithom and Raamses (Exod. il 1) with, respectively, a site in the Wadi Tumilat and Piramesse, and suggests that "during the reign of Amenhotep III Beduins worshipping Yahweh appeared at the margin of Egyptian attention" (p. 169), that they were the "Proto-Israelites" (p. 169), and that "the southern route [of the exodus] is the logical one in the biblical context" (p. 170). The book is supplied with many plates, figures and maps, and each essay has a list of bibliographical references. [J. A. E.] S. C. REIF (ed.), Published Materialfrom the Cambridge Genizah Collections. A Bibliography 1896-1980. Cambridge University Library Genizah Series 6. xvi + 608 pp. Cambridge University Press for Cambridge University Library, 1989. ?75, $125. The value of the material from the Cairo Genizah for various aspects of the study of the Hebrew Bible (and for other subjects) is well known among scholars, and the 200,000 items in the Taylor-Schechter (Genizah) Collection of the Cam- bridge University Library (supplemented by some in the library of Westminster College, Cambridge), constitute the world's largest assembly of that material. Stefan Reif, who has done so much to make the contents available for scholarly research, has now performed yet another invaluable service. He and his colleagues have prepared a bibliography of published works (and of S. D. Goitein's as yet unpublished India Book) relevant to the study of the texts in Cambridge-a bibliography of some 50,000 items. After the introduction, a guide to using the book, and a table setting out the system of transliteration, the catalogue is divided into two parts, each arranged in three columns to make maximum use of the available space. The first part (pp. 1-432) lists the manuscripts arranged in order of classmark and gives bibliographical references in abbreviated form, which may be understood with the help of the later part of the bibliography. The second (pp. 435-587) lists authors by their surnames (and initials when it is necessary to distinguish between different people with the same surname), and notes under each the title (usually abbreviated) of the publication, the manuscripts mentioned, and the relevant pages of the publication. Finally, pp. 591-608 give fuller informa- tion about short titles and abbreviations used earlier in the catalogue. One of the services performed by the first part of this catalogue is the correction of many wrong references to manuscripts in the publications listed. The correct reference is given under the appropriate classmark; and under the inaccurately presented classmark the reader is referred to the corrected entry. In the second part, only the correct references are given. This catalogue is obviously now an indispensable tool for anyone working on the Cambridge collections, and it is good to know that a second volume is being prepared to continue the bibliography after 1980 and to include any addenda and corrigenda to the first that may be needed.

This has now been published, with the addition of a clear and helpful introduction by Maria Teresa Ortega Monasterio. The biblical text (in the version of the Alba Bible) is presented verse by verse, followed by a "catena" of medieval comments, which are themselves carefully annotated. This form of presentation renders the volume easy to consult, and brings into interesting relief the different characteristics of the various commentaries. [N. R. M. DE LANGE] G. W. SAVRAN, Telling and Retelling. Quotation in Biblical Narrative. Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature. xii + 161 pp. Indiana University Press, Bloom- ington and Indianapolis, 1988. The particular form of quotations studied in this revised version of a Brandeis University dissertation is that where a speaker repeats his own or another's words to a third party. Notable examples of this device are found in Gen. xxiv and the Joseph story, but they are also frequent else- where. Such quotations may be labelled either "verifiable" if the words are repeated from an earlier passage or "unverifiable" if they are not. The interest of the study arises from the fact that frequently the words are not quoted exactly, so that narrative and contextual considerations come into play to help explain the differences. Limiting his analysis to the narratives of Genesis to 2 Kings, Savran first summarizes such formal features as the introductory formulae used, who is quoting whom to whom, and so on. The bulk of the work is then discussed under two main headings: "story analysis", which studies quotations from the point of view of the characters within the narrative, and "discourse analysis", which studies them from the point of view of the narrator's communication with his reader. An appendix deals separately with the particular and frequent use of this phenomenon in the book of Deuteronomy. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] W. H. SCHMIDT, Exodus, Sinai und Mose. Erwdgungen zu Exodus 1-19 und 24. Ertrage der Forschung 191. viii + 165 pp. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt, 1983. DM 37.50; for members DM 22. The research reviewed here relates not so much to the composition of the book of Exodus (though Schmidt clearly continues to find the existence of the sources J and E a necessary hypothesis) as to traditio-historical questions about the role of Moses and the foun- dations of Israelite religion. Schmidt provides a useful introduction to the modern discussion about Moses but, as he is aware, few solutions: the caution in historical reconstruction introduced by M. Noth's questions remains influential. Never- theless, like other recent scholars he is unconvinced by the theory that the exodus and Sinai traditions were originally separate and, in a final chapter which follows the treatment of the various sections of the Exodus narrative, he examines in some detail the possibility that the "Midian tradition" forms an additional bond between Israel in Egypt and at Sinai and a proof that Moses is an original element of both episodes.

Univer- sitiitsverlag, Freiburg, Switzerland; and Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G6ttingen, 1987. Schroer's book is a publication of her dissertation (1986). After a brief intro- duction in which she looks at the history of the subject, the problem, and the pic- tures in Israel and the ban on representations, she considers in ch. 1 sculptures in the shape of trees, flowers and fruit. In her first section she discusses Asherah and asherahs in the O.T. The second section discusses the decorative element of the flora in the formation of Solomon's temple. Ch. 2 examines sculpture in the form of animals and mixed beings, including cherubim, sphinxes, stag demons, teraphim and ephod. Ch. 3 discusses O.T. reports of anthropomorphic depictions</page></plain_text>
