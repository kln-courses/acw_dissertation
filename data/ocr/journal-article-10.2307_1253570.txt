<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT GREEK ARCHEOLOGY AND FOLK-LORE. T HE author of The Golden Boughi, in a recent dis- cussion as to the observance among the Greeks of a superstition which is very prevalent among savage races, remarks upon the comparative paucity of the evidence on these matters which has come down to us. Probably the absence of such evidence is merely accidental; for "considering", he says, "the small chance any popular superstition had of getting into classical literature, and, if it did get in, of surviving the shipwreck of ancient books, this lack of evidence is not surprising." And yet, from the little that we do know, we may safely argue that the harvest to be gathered is of the richest. The difficulty that confronts us is twofold: first, in the fact that Greek literature and Greek art, of the periods at least of which we should like to learn, are occupied more with the higher intelligence and the public life than with the bourgeois and work-a-day aspect of the people, from which we have most to expect; and secondly, because they present to us a people who have long since emerged from the primitive condition, and are no longer in the earliest natural stage of their existence. It is precisely of this early stage that archaeology has much to tell us; when art and literature are not, and historical records fade away into the legendary tradition of the past, the ultimate appeal is to the spade: and inasmuch as death is the leveller of persons, and decay covers equally the temple and the hovel, the impression which we get when, however little, the veil is thus drawn aside, is often more broadly true and valuable, where customs and ideas are concerned, than that which the eclecticism of the artist or historian can give.</page><page sequence="2">530 Recent Greek Archeology and Folk-lore. The present age is pre-eminently an age of excavation; with so much and so varied energy in the field, discoveries follow each other with bewildering rapidity; so that it is difficult even to the professed archaeologist to keep pace with the march, or rather the race, of progress. I propose, therefore, for those who do not come under this category, to call attention here to some of the questions which have arisen in the last few years in this field of enquiry; the mythological aspects of such enquiry I shall leave aside, inasmuch as they have already been passed in review, in the excellent article by Prof. Jevons which appeared in these pages,l and also, in their more direct relation to excavation, in Mr. Louis Dyer's book, The Gods in Greece. With the spade in hand, the first question that naturally offers itself is that of the Greek ideas of the dead and the future state, their burial customs, and those manifold habits and institutions which depended thereon. And on this head the researches of the past few years have increased our knowledge all along the line, and especially in the early pre-Homeric days. There are probably few histories which offer so interesting and instructive a study of change and development of ideas. We can now trace the gradual evolution of the idea of a realm of Hades presided over by a king and queen of the underworld; but this concep- tion was of comparatively late origin; before we can arrive at anything conclusive as to the genesis and simplest forms of the Greek ideas about the dead, much more scientific exploration of certain sites is needed; on the other hand, much has already been learnt. The earliest tombs found in Greece are spread over a wide range of country extending from the Troad in the north to Cyprus in the south, and covering a number of small islands, such as Paros, Carpathos, etc. These tombs seem to belong to a race sufficiently alike in their customs and their remains to warrant us in regarding them as one and the same people. The rudeness of their condition 1 Folk-Lore, I89I, p. 220.</page><page sequence="3">Recent Greek A rch/olooy and Folk-lore. 531 would seem to point to a very remote period; there is no trace of foreign importation, the potter's wheel and the use of metals, except as the crudest form of ornament, are equally unknown, the knives being of obsidian; all this would agree with the conditions of the end of the Stone Age. Here, however, we are met by the obvious and ever- recurring difficulty of deciding between the primitive and the savage. It is conceivable, of course, that in some of these islands unvisited by external influences the use of obsidian knives and primitive ornament may have con- tinued on, belated, as it were, in the general advance of their fellows. But if we may, as seems possible, assume a homogeneous population with close intercourse amongst each other, it is natural to expect an advance paripassu over all alike. Now we have at Hissarlik several strata of civilisation superimposed, and this is the lowest; and at Cyprus, where remains of all times are found, the same fact is confirmed. This then seems certain, that at a remote date, before Mycenae, before any introduction of the foreign element into Greece, this race held a considerable part of the islands, and probably of the Asiatic coast of the iEgaean. The burial customs of this people are as completely a riddle as their origin and date: so far as has been yet discovered, they seem to offer absolutely no relation to the Greek customs of later times. The best representative series have been obtained in excavations at Oliaros (Antiparos) by Bent,' and at Amorgos,2 in both of which places the graves, partly extending under the sea, are astonishingly numerous. At Oliaros, which seems only mentioned by Heraclides of Pontus, as a "Sidonian" colony, Mr. Bent found no trace of historic remains; here the graves, usually of rough earthenware slabs placed box fashion for the poorer, and of marble slabs for the richer, were of irregular design, oblong, triangular, and square, 1 Journal of Hellenic Studies, v, p. 47. 2 Diimmler, in Ath. Mitth., xi, p. 15, etc.</page><page sequence="4">532 Recent Greek A rcheology and Folk-lore. but never of sufficient size to contain an extended body, generally averaging about 3 ft. by 2 ft. On the other hand, there is never a trace of ashes, so that the possibility of incineration is excluded. Dimmler supposes that perhaps the bodies were buried in a sitting position; of course it is a well-known fact that primitive man slept in a sitting position, and had muscles developed specially for this purpose: and instances of this position are not unknown in many Greek necropoleis; but in these cases the burial is, I believe, not primitive, and the body is invariably placed within a large earthenware vase of the pithos form, which necessitates the sitting position. On the other hand, the pithos can hardly have been an essential of primitive burial, as the making of so large a vase in terra-cotta is a task which demands considerable skill. This "pithos" is nothing more nor less than the tub of the cynic Diogenes, concerning which so much ingenuity has been spent; the story of the philosopher may very well have arisen out of the burial custom; on the other hand, Aristophanes (Knights, 792) speaks of the Athenian poor as living in tubs (pithaknai) during the terrors of the Peloponnesian war; anyhow, the tradition had taken artistic form in Roman times, for we have in the British Museum a Roman lamp showing the cynic in his tub. Diimmler's supposition can hardly be correct in the case of the Oliaros graves at any rate, for most of these recep- tacles, which are much too small for even a single sitting body, actually contain the bones of more than one, heaped in confusion. In one tomb, which was only about 2 ft. square, two skulls were tightly wedged together, side by side, and the bones appertaining were huddled at the foot; this is being "united in death" with a vengeance Is it possible that the dead of this primitive race were exposed, like those of the Parsees on the "dakhma" or "tower of silence"? The only feasible explanation seems to me to be Bent's suggestion that the flesh from these bodies was in some way removed before interment; but</page><page sequence="5">Recent Greek Archaology and Folk-lore. 533 if this were the case, it offers no analogy, so far as I am aware, with anything in Hellenic custom or tradition. On the other hand, there is in these primitive tombs abundant evidence of what seems to be a cult of the dead. Nearly all the graves contain some form of offering, whether pottery, ornaments, shells, or knives, deposited sometimes in the "box" itself, sometimes above the upper or below the lower slab; one of Bent's tombs contained pottery alone, with no trace of bones whatever. At Melos a further development was observed; here we have the remains of not only a necropolis of precisely the same character, but of a town, which must have been already destroyed in pre-Greek times. Some of these tombs are hewn in the solid rock; and here and there, while con- taining similar objects, are of much larger size, with a double chamber sufficiently large to admit a person stand- ing upright; in these cases there are niches in the walls of the tomb which have evidently been intended for holding a lamp or a vase, such as would be used in bringing offerings to the dead.1 It looks very much as if these primitive people, not so very long after the Stone Age, had already developed the idea of the soul inhabiting the tomb, even though the huddled fleshless bones had long lost all reminiscence of the human form. The primitive pottery of these people is itself instructive as an instance of how different races at different dates independently arrive at the same practical results. The forms are independent of the wheel, and therefore open to any kind of imitative influence: primitive man uses for his vessel, if he lives by the seashore, a shell; if inland, perhaps a gourd, or a horn, or a basket of plaited withies: to make this last water-tight he must cover it with clay; and hence we have among this pottery forms derivative from shells, gourds, and horns, and patterns which are clearly suggested 1 Similar tombs in Syra are described (Rev. Arch., 1862, p. 224) as Roman! But thirty years has made a considerable difference in our ideas.</page><page sequence="6">534 Recent Greek Archcology and Folk-lore. by plaiting. As one parallel instance, where doubtless many could be offered, I need only refer to a detailed study of the ceramic art of the ancient Pueblos,l published in I882, which contains a great deal of matter interesting to the student of folk-lore and of ornament alike: the Pueblos seem to have passed through precisely the same stages of primitive development as the primitive inhabitants of the AEgaean. The anthropomorphic or naturalistic idea of the vase which the Greek potter has ever in his mind, and which is everywhere so prevalent, has a curious analogy here; when a Pueblo woman has made a vessel, she will tell you it is a " Made Being": she recognises that there is something human about it; and in its decoration the lines of pattern are often left open as the " exit trail of life".2 Before leaving this subject, it may be worth mentioning that the sitting position in burial has received curious illustration by the subject painted on a vase of the fifth century B.C., which has lately been bought by the British Museum. The story represented is that of Glaukos and Polyeidos; Glaukos, the son of Minos, King of Crete, was one day found to be missing; his father summoned the seer Polyeidos, who discovered the child dead in a cask of honey. Minos thereupon commanded that Polyeidos, unable to restore the child to life, should be buried with him; this was done, but as Polyeidos sat in the tomb he saw a snake come out of the ground, and killed it; after this a second snake came and brought the first to life by laying a particular kind of herb upon its mouth: Polyeidos employed the same means to restore the dead Glaukos, and both were released from the tomb. On the many curious mythological points of interest in this story I will not here venture, but there are two points which bear upon comparative customs. The moment chosen by the vase- painter is here, as was often the case, a combination of different episodes, so that the picture may tell you in 1 In the Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, Washington, I882-3. 2 Ibid., p. 5Io.</page><page sequence="7">Recent Greek Archzeology and Folk-lore. 535 itself as much as possible of the legend. We have a section of the tumulus with the tomb chamber surmounted externally by the votive tripod. On the floor of the chamber is the dead Glaukos. Polyeidos is striking at the snake, which, already dead, is being restored by its mate. The attitude of Glaukos is interesting; he sits in a confined attitude with his knees drawn up to his chin and hands clasped round them; exactly as we may presume primitive man to have slept. Now it is hardly likely that the Athenian vase-painter was here copying a practice which he had seen: on the contrary, it is highly improbable that such a mode of burial existed in Athens in the fifth century B.C.: we can only presume that he was following some tradition that in the legendary past the Greeks, and particularly perhaps the Kretans,l buried their dead in a sitting position. The other interesting point in this story is the fact of the boy being found in a cask of honey. We may presume that this cask was probably the ordinary pithos, such as was used for storing wine, olives, etc., and usually half buried in the ground. We have in the Museum a vase- picture of such a pithos, with a boy tumbling head-first into it, in which I should be inclined to see an earlier stage of the same story. Now, in the Glaukos legend, with its honey, its seated corpse, and its pithos, we are reminded of the stories that evidently circulated in antiquity as to actual burial customs which the Greeks did not understand, and which may have arisen out of some vague report of the mummifying practices of the Egyptians. Herodotos' story (iv, 76) of the mode of burial of the Scythian kings has a certain vraisemblance as a method of embalming; but the nearest to our legend is the account given by Xenophon (Hell., v, 3, I9) of the system applied in the case of the kings of Sparta. When any of these died abroad, the corpse was laid in honey in order to preserve it until such time as it could be buried at home. 1 Several of the large burial pithi have been found in Krete.</page><page sequence="8">536 Recent Greek Archkeology and Folk-lore. In case this has not been previously suggested, I would offer it to mythologists as a possible explanation of the curious elements in the Glaukos legend.' In Homer, incineration seems to be the usual process, and there is no definite mention of inhumation. This, however, cannot be taken as true of the Mycenaean period, for upon these sites we have certainly evidence of skeletons: it has been suggested that possibly the more important people were burned and the less important ones buried. However this may be, in the immediately post-Homeric times the process of burning seems to have found little favour in Greece proper, where the usual method was in- humation. The decline of the Mycenaean power is marked by the rise of a powerful people who use a geometric system of ornament and have weapons of iron. Whatever be the date of their first appearance, they certainly continue down to the end of the eighth century B.C., and show a direct con- nection with the beginnings of historic Greece. On their painted vases we have the ceremonies depicted which formed the basis of all subsequent Greek funeral rites; and in this connection it is interesting to note that we have lately obtained a clue to the relations existing between dead and living among these people. Recent excavations in front of the Dipylon Gate at Athens2 have laid bare in some cases as many as three strata of superimposed tombs; the lowest (of about 700 B.C.) are evidently of this "geo- metric" people. Here burning is almost unknown; the dead body is laid in the grave itself, which is then covered with wood, and the shaft filled nearly to the top; a small space at the top is left unfilled, and into this the tomb- monument, usually a large painted vase, is set: the space around the vase thus served as a sort of trench, communi- cating by means of the shaft direct with the dead body In the Odyssey it will be remembered that Odysseus, for 1 The story furnished the Greeks with an adage; "Glaukos drank honey and rose again" was said of those who, having been given up for dead, recovered. 2 Arch. Anzeizer, I892, p. 19.</page><page sequence="9">Recent Greek A rchology and Folk-lore. 537 his sacrifice to the ghosts in I-ades, digs a trench, and into it he pours the wine and blood for the souls to drink: in these tombs the trench is evidently for a similar purpose: the sacrifice is performed at the tomb, and the liquid is poured into the trench for the benefit of the soul below; in some cases the remains of such sacrifices have been found beside the tomb. A still more curious fact is connected with the vase which serves as external decoration; it is noticed that a good many of them have a hole in the bottom, and it is suggested that they thus served a double purpose, both as receptacle for the sacrifices to the dead and also as ornament: the hole in the bottom would allow of the food and drink placed within the vase reaching the shade below. One such vase was found to contain the bones of an ox, and we are reminded that it was Solon who first forbade the sacrifice of an ox to the dead. But though the sacrifice was discontinued, the libation probably lasted down to a considerably later time; at any rate we have evidence in the fifth century of amphorae of a peculiar shape, with perforated bottom, being used in this way: later, when the beautiful marble stele has come into vogue, the only reminiscence of the vase is usually a small lekythos or jug laid upon or hung to the stele: the larger vase comes in for a tomb decoration later once more, but it rests upon a stele, and is probably merely decorative, its original signi- ficance being lost. In the Dipylon graves, then, we have the dead person regarded as something with influence outside the tomb, and to be assuaged with offerings and sacrifices. This is the beginning of the true Greek conception, and is in direct contrast to the Homeric notion, just as the Homeric cus- tom of burial is different from those of later times. In Homer, that is, in epic tradition, something still exists after death, the shadowy double of a ian deprived of all the characteristics of life.1 This " Psyche", when once the 1 Rohde, Psyche.

N N</page><page sequence="10">538 Recent Greek Archeology and Folk-lore. body is burnt, goes far away to its own place at the end of the world, and thenceforth it has no cult from the living, no power nor activity among them d toutjamais. It is clear then that this Homeric belief is a break in the direct tradi- tion of ideas: we have seen that the most primitive people in Greece certainly seemed to have a cult of the dead, and that this cult was continued in Greece from the earliest his- toric times; the epos has, it is true, some indication of a transitional stage, in the episode of the descent of Odysseus into Hades (Odyss. xi), and in the existence of exceptional punishments after death, such as those of Sisyphos and Tantalos; but the fact remains, that the period of the epic influence represents a break in the regular stratification. How is this to be explained? Rohde conjectures that the reason lies in the general political disturbances caused by the Doric invasion. So long as the tribes had no fixed settlement, they had to burn their dead, and forego the cult which depended on the local existence of ancestral tombs; the shades, moreover, were for the time collected into a common Hades always remote, instead of hovering each about his own ancestral grave. Then, when the race is settled again, the old rites and the old local cult is revived. The explanation is ingenious, but hardly satisfactory. In the first place it presupposes a continuous inheritance of ideas between the primitive, Mycenaean, and the Dorian peoples, which is no more certain than their relative dating. The most recent evidence goes to show that the Mycenzean civilisation went on down to a comparatively late date, at any rate for some considerable period side by side with the "geometric" (Dorian ?). Are we then to confine the epic idea of the dead to the period after the expulsion of the Mycenaean peoples, that iq, when they were homeless nomads? Even if we admit this, it would be strange that the epos should reflect only this temporary makeshift re- ligion, and tell us nothing of the ideas of the future state which the Achaeans must have had in the long ages when they still inhabited Mycenae and Tiryns. The whole ques-</page><page sequence="11">Recent Greek Arch-eology and Folk-lore. 539 tion is one which must await further excavation; we need to study the contents of many more " Mycenaean" tombs, and to be able to define more accurately the dating of the Mycenaean period, before we can attempt to reach the solu- tion of this problem. Between the Homeric conception of the future state and that of the Platonic philosophy,1 from the descent into Hades of Odysseus to that of Er, son of Armenius, what a gap is here! The century immediately preceding Plato was a pregnant period for Athenian thought. The sixth and fifth centuries brought into Athens a horde of strange religions from the East, the Sabazian rite, the Adonian, and the various forms of Pythagoreanism, especially the Orphic teaching which became so popular there towards the close of the sixth century. The names of Onomakritos, Musaeus, Bakis, Epimenides, all point to the superstitions rife in Peisistratid Athens. The influence of these new ideas on Athenian thought is illustrated in a comparison of the three great tragedians.2 In AEschylus we have the new awakening, the enthusiastic preaching of purity and right for their own sake; in Sophocles the reaction in favour of peace and reunion; and in Euripides the " troubled ques- tioning, the sceptic silence, the half-contemptuous calm". The excavations on the site of the Kabirion at Thebes have thrown considerable light on the Orphic doctrine; we now know that it was written for Athens, as an attempt to combine the nature philosophy of the Ionians, the teach- ing of the school of Thales, with their already existing theogonic system.3 It was mainly an attempt to observe the deeper truths of the nature which surrounds us; but it also embraced the life of the soul, the teaching of a genuine doctrine of immortality. Plutarch, writing to console his wife on the death of their infant daughter, comforts her with this thought as taught by tradition and revealed in 1 Republic, x, 614. 2 See Miss Daniel in Classical Review, iv, 81. 3 Kern in Hermes, I890, p. I foll. NN2</page><page sequence="12">540 Recent Greek Archcology and Folk-lore. the mysteries of Dionysos.1 That it had in fact a firm hold upon the ancient world, down to a late period, we see from the monuments. Knapp2 has collected the different phases of the myth as it occurs on works of art, even down to the representation in the Christian catacombs. It is the works of art that enable us to follow the development of the popular idea of the underworld. Furtwangler (in the Collection Saburoff, i, p. 16) has traced the successive con- ceptions on the sepulchral monuments of the sixth and fifth centuries; starting from the Spartan grave-reliefs with their pairs of ancestors worshipped as of heroic proportions, at the tomb itself, to the idea of a place where all such ancestors meet, and finally to the evolution of a Hades with its archetypal pair of god and goddess as the king and queen. On the Attic vase-paintings the image of the soul (the eidolon) is frequently represented. In the earlier pictures we have as a rule the single soul of the personage repre- sented beside it, a minute winged reproduction of the figure itself. On the vases of the fifth and fourth centuries we often find a plurality of eidola around the grave or a corpse. It has been suggested3 that these are the souls who have been shut out of Hades, and who are still clinging to the earthly and sensual; this is in keeping with the Orphic teaching as shown in the verses on the gold plates found at Thurion and Petelia, and corresponds with Plato (Plhaido, 30). Against this it is urged that the plurality of souls need only refer to the fact of a large number of people dying together, as by an epidemic, or to the others lying in the same family sepulchre. This practical idea does not commend itself to us. On the other hand, we may recollect that on the Greek vases the eidolon is not necessarily always that of a dead person; in the Psycho- 1 Frazer, Golden Bough, i, p. 324. 2 Wurtenb. Correspondenzblatt, Bd. xxvii (Stuttgart, I880). 3 Hirsch, De animarum aplud ant. imnagg., Lips., I889; cf. Kern in Roin. Mitth., I890, p. 69.</page><page sequence="13">Recent Greek Archeology and Folk-lore. 54r stasia vases, for example, Hermes stands between the two warriors in combat, and is actually weighing their eidola in the balance. The Orphic doctrines were not, like the mysteries, confined to the narrow circle of the initiated; and as the ideas of spiritual activity penetrated downwards into the general mass of the laity, it was only natural that they should open the road for the grosser forms of superstition; this had already been the case in Egypt, as we see from the story Herodotus (ii, I8I) tells of King Amasis (B.C. 572), who believed himself spell-bound by his wife Ladike. From at least the fifth century downwards we con- sequently hear constant allusions in the classical writers to sorcerers and similar "medicine-men", whose powers reach beyond the grave. Plato (Rep., ii, 364B) speaks of the wandering soothsayers who go about saying that they have power from the gods to avenge any man on his enemies; and compel the gods "by certain enchantments and magic knots": the word here used, KarTad-/,uo, is con- nected with the formula which usually .occurs on the leaden plates on which these imprecations were inscribed. Another form of the same word is found thrice in Homer with reference to impeding or altering the course of the winds. Miss Macdonald, who has lately published a very interesting article on this subject,l reminds us that "the idea that the winds might be fettered or tied in sacks is common to different nations, and even now the Lapps believe in it, and give their sailors magic sacks containing, so they believe, certain winds to secure for them a safe journey." Later on, she remarks, "the KcactaSertLos had a double magic meaning; on the one hand, the gods and spirits invoked were bound by it to perform certain things; and on the other, those against whom the spell was directed were, so to say, tied up and left helpless, in fact 'spell-bound'." Miss Macdonald publishes a considerable number of 1 Trans. Soc. Bibi. Arch., xiii, p. I60.</page><page sequence="14">542 Recent Greek Archeology and Folk-lore. these dire inscribed upon leaden and talc tablets which have lately been found near the site of the ancient Amathus in Cyprus. Captain Handcock, through whom they were procured for the British Museum, has kindly furnished me with further details of the discovery, which was made by some villagers in clearing what seemed to be a large dis- used well. They first found a quantity of squared stones, and then rubble, under which was a great quantity of human bones, among which were some gold earrings. In the lower stratum of the bones, they first found pieces of the lead, and subsequently pieces of the inscribed talc, some pieces of which were attached to the side of the well imbedded in gypsum. Later on, they came to water, at about 40 ft. from the surface. The walls of a disused well would be an admirable place for fastening these "penny curses"; in order to reach the infernal deities one must go below the surface of the ground, just as in early times we noted that a shaft was sunk for the sacrificial wine to reach the shade; such a well, its walls bristling with curses nailed' or plastered on, may well have seemed to the awe-struck Cypriot villagers a veritable descensus Averni. In the Greek magic papyri, the publication of which2 has thrown so much light on these matters, among the other instruc- tions for the amateur in the black art is an injunction 1 The leaden tablets were mostly folded in three and nailed to the wall. In an inscription from Erythrae (Rev. des Et. Gr., iv, p. 287) the local Sibyl says of herself: "I transfix oracles, chaunting pro- phecies of the sufferings that will come to mortal men." The word &amp;K-repovw, here translated "transfix", would suggest that the Sibylline "leaves" were laminas of metal nailed up like the dirce. In the vi AEneid the utterances of the Sibyl are onfolia leaves. Unless this is a poetical allusion to metal lamina:, we may see in it a parallel usage to the Corinthian habit of writing the names of persons proposed for ostracism upon leaves (petala) of olive. The custom was common in India, where the earliest documents were frequently inscribed on leaves of palm or pipal tree. 2 Wessely, Griech. Zauber-piapyri; Leemans, Papyri Greci, Mius. Lugd., i885.</page><page sequence="15">Recent Greek Arcahology and Folk-lore. 543 which illustrates this subterranean idea; the charm must be carried to the tomb of one who has died untimely, and after digging placed within: or else may be thrown into an artificial well on a day when no business is done. The provenance of these dirw is itself a very interesting point. It was in Cyprus that Barnabas and Saul had the fracas with Elymas, which resulted in the sorcerer's dis- comfiture and blindness. It was further currently reported that another noted wizard, Simon Magus, whose exposure fell to Philip in Samaria, hailed from this island; it was natural that Cyprus, the meeting-place of the seething waters of Eastern and Western thought, should breed many such an one; this Simon Magus is said to have been the founder of the Gnostic heresy, which already in these Cypriot inscriptions shows its influence in the names of the deities occurring in them and in the mention of the "great ineffable name, at the sound of which all creation trembled for fear". Among much else that is interesting, Miss Macdonald's paper contains a curious explanation of the word 7roXvdvSptob which is frequently used in the Cyprus inscriptions; the only analogous word in the dictionaries is 7roXvdvptov, which is used first for a "place where many men assemble", and so of a tomb in which many lie buried; from this, Miss Macdonald presumes a usage of the word simply as "tomb"; and thus rroXvdvaptot would be equivalent to "the tomb men", and so a general name for the dead. I would suggest, however, that "the place of many men" is more likely to refer to Hades, the populousness of which is a universal idea. It is scarcely necessary here to refer to the well-known Virgil passage (An., vi, 706) of the innumera gentes, populique, who fly like bees in summer around the visitor, or the "like autumn leaves in Vallombrosa" of Paradise Lost. The 7roAXvadvpto are the people of the place where many men are; as the fairies are the " little people", so the dead are the "many people"</page><page sequence="16">544 Recent Greek Archaology and Folk-lore. in fact, "the majority"; the actual expression occurs in the Ecclesiazusw (I073), of the old woman who has arisen "from the majority" (7rapa 7Tr\V XtcL6wv), and we have this usage more than once in the epigrams of the Anthology. This euphemistic expression is only one more evidence of that nameless fear of the dead which in so many savage nations finds expression in numberless ways. If we wish to study the later developments of Hellenic thought it is to Asia Minor that we must look, where the researches 6f Ramsay, Sterrett, Hogarth, and others have, during the last decade, opened up an entirely new world of research.1 Specially interesting it is to get, as we do here, an occasional glimpse of the beginnings of the early Christian Church; we have the legends of Avircius and Antemon, showing, as Ramsay has remarked, the process by which remarkable natural phenomena, hitherto the pro- perty of the pagan gods or heroes, were speedily transferred by the Christians to their saints. We see, in the towns especially, where liberty of thought was not always enjoyed, that the Christians were forced to conceal their religious opinions. In these towns around the old religion had grown up an extensive ramification of societies and guilds, more or less connected with a pagan deity: and the Chris- tian communities are consequently found obtaining legal recognition under the guise of burial societies, and alluded to in much the same terms as the guilds of Dionysos. One curious phrase occurs on an inscription of A.D. 200, where such a society is supposed to be alluded to as that rov 7ropfvpo/3afxS)v; this phrase would for the world in general imply "purple dyers", but to the initiated Christian "washed in blood". And, lastly, we have the epitaph of the sceptic who has finished with belief of any kind: " I was not; I be- came; I am not; I care not"; finishing with a curiously 1 It is interesting to note, in reference to Prof. Jevons' paper, that in Sterrett's inscriptions (ii, 31) Helios in conjunction with Selene protects the grave from desecration.</page><page sequence="17">Recent Greek Archeology and Folk-lore. 545 inconsistent remark, as of one who has still existence, Hail, thou who passeth by." One more curious instance of the tenacity of old tradi- tional practices. We have seen how the Dipylon folk, before 600 B.C., poured their offering to the dead down a specially constructed channel. In a Roman cemetery at Carthage, of the second century A.D., the identical practice has been found1; here the ashes within the cippus are placed in a pierced urn, which communicates with the outside by means of a sloping channel; down this channel the offerings to the manes were poured. This usage had the advantage of economy, because the same tomb could be used to contain successive consignments of ashes. How the custom of offering to the dead struck the later Hellenic intelligence we see, by occasional glimpses, in the Anthology. "In the cold shadows underground the ghost will not be comforted by ointments and garlands lavished on the tomb; though the clay covering be drenched with wine, the dead man will not drink."2 1 Rev. Arch., I888, vol. xii, p. 151. 2 Anth. Pal., xi, 8. Mackail, Select Epigrams from the Gk. Anth., p. 70. CECIL SMITH.</page></plain_text>
