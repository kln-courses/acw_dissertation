<plain_text><page sequence="1">Recent Studies in the English Renaissance A R T H U R E. B A R K E R This survey of printed studies for the twelve months following (roughly) the end of October, 1961, has six sections: I, historical background; II, literary back- ground; III, early English humanism; IV, Elizabethan prose and poetry; V, Jacobean and Caroline prose and poetry; VI, Milton. I D. HAY'S The Italian Renaissance (Cambridge) reviews developing cultural values and wisely appraises and delimits their influence in the North. In The Renaissance, edited by T. Helton (Wisconsin), Mattingly, Kristeller, Rosen- thal, Rosen, review the somewhat tired "problem" of the Renaissance since Burckhardt and Voigt, and B. Weinberg and H. Levin speak with heartening brilliance for the literary criticism that is freeing itself from the "problem." Science and the Arts, edited by H. H. Rhys (Princeton, for Swarthmore) includes lectures by Toulmin, Ackerman, Palisca on their fields, and D. Bush speaking in not dissimilar terms for his. Kristeller reviews humanism once more (SRen, 9). This year produced little of importance as to either Tudor or Stuart historical background. J. Dent's Quest for Nonsuch (Hutchinson) is an admirable, illustrated account of the excavations on the site of the almost legendary palace. M. St. Clare Byrne's Elizabethan Life (in a paperback reprint; Barnes and Noble) still impresses by lively detail and its forceful prefatory complaint about simplified versions of the Elizabethan world-picture. E. Jenkins's Elizabeth and Essex (Coward-Mc- Cann) has the poets sometimes startlingly in the picture. The Raleigh renaissance proceeds in A. L. Rowse's account of the rather unpoetical Throckmorton household (Harper), and, with rather more verse, in N. L. William's documentary biography (Eyre and Spottiswoode). G. P. V. Akrigg somewhat diffusely in Jacobean Pageant (Harvard) records the tensions and re- laxations of town and court in the light reflected from the neurotic split between the king's real and stamped face. H. R</page><page sequence="2">R E RECENT S T U D I E S Trevor-Roper's Laud is reprinted (Shoe String Press) with some prefatory reconsiderations. E. W. Talbert's Problem of Order (North Carolina) significantly readjusts our simplified notions about the harmony of the Elizabethan body politic, making clear the medieval background of the complex of principles in Smith, Hooker, Sidney, as prefatory to dramatic studies. Ruth MohI's Three Estates and Studies in Spenser, Milton, and the Theory of Monarchy, have happily been reprinted (both Ungar). The late H. N. Brailsford's The Levellers (Stanford) is an enthusias- tic and full account of their ideas and activities. Pauline Gregg's Free-born John (Harrap) is a full biography of Lilburne, well documented and with a comprehensive bibliography. Firth's Cromwell's Army has been reprinted (Barnes and Noble). K. D. McRae, in a simply superb facsimile (Harvard), uses Knolles's 1606 version, Six Bookes of a Commonweal, as a means of handling the variations in Bodin's several editions, and in introduction and source-notes shows the excellence of the full critical biography in preparation. II For the background of English literary theory and practice, there must now be added to B. Weinberg's Italian History (Chicago) his brief essay on the practical motive of Italian criticism (UTQ, 31) and B. Hathway's depth-shaft studies of the increasingly academic philosophical complexities of five key critical ideas in The Age of Criticism (Cornell). Neither Weinberg nor Hathway much attends to "St. Augustine's Rhetoric of Silence"5 in their background; but as it is reviewed by J. A. Mazzeo (JHI, 23) it provides an important reference point for the preoccupations represented this year by (among others) C. K. Cannon's discussion of William Whitaker's theory of Biblical allegory (HLQ, 25), D. B. Quinn on Donne's and H. R. MacCallum on Milton's exegetical principles (below). C. Breslin (JHI, 22) examines philosophy and philology in Auerbach's "aesthetic historicism" and E. LaB. Cerbonnier the logic of biblical anthropomorphism (HTR, 60). B. A. Gerrish on Grace and Reason in Luther (Oxford) is throughout more or less concerned with the exegetical problem, and H. J. Forstman on Word and Spirit in Calvin (Stanford) does a deep analysis of what lies behind the tension, in effect, between the doctrinal and homiletic. L. A. Sasek, in The Literary 120</page><page sequence="3">ARTHUR E. BARKER Temper of the English Puritans (Louisiana State) indicates the desirability of further theoretical study by reviewing various opinions about style, the theatre, play-reading, and romances which show the Puritans to be at least heirs of humanism. I. Sowton uses Wilson's Arte to show how poets like Spenser and Davies used the persuasive rhetorical structural principles (as well as figures) of humanist rhetoric (UTQ, 32). In Reason and the Imagination, edited in honor of M. H. Nicolson by J. A. Mazzeo (Columbia), R. F. Jones on the mid-seventeenth- century humanist defence of learning is chiefly concerned with the Anglican apology for rhetoric against plain Puritan spirituality and style. Current work on the history of science, unlike much earlier, has little literary significance. Of obviously first importance is the reprinting of Jones' Ancients and Moderns (Washington, St. Louis), with a new preface. Rhys and Toulmin (see Swarth- more above) have some applicable comments. Marie Boas's comprehensive review, 1450-1630 (Harper) will be of great introductory use as to Copemrnicanism and its progressive modifications, Galileo's difficulties, physiology, magnetism, occultism, and so on; but it will cause literary instructors many headaches by its simplified literary assumptions as to the effect of breaking circles, illustrated by its reduction of Donne's "new philosophy" to the level of Sylvester's doggerel version of Du Bartas's doggerel by way of Bodin's encyclopedic impercipience. R. L. Colie considers the paradoxical view of nature's art and its reflection in paradoxes (Mazzeo for Nicol- son), and on a higher ontological level C. A. Patrides adds to his earlier report evidence that the period is confused in its various orderings of angelic hierarchies (JHI, 23). The visual arts and music are more important than science this year. F. B. Artz traces stylistic trends in the various arts from Early and High Renaissance, through Mannerism, Baroque, etc., in From the Renaissance to Romanticism, whose use in culture-courses will echo in literary classes since it delocalizes its items and sets, say, Donne and Milton in a thin and narrow El-Grecoesque perspective. E. Rosenthal (Wisconsin, above) reviews the development of and disputes over such terms in art history, and J. A. Ackerman (Swarthmore) discusses Man- nerist naturalism. Three admirers of the school of Wellek, Boase, de Mourgues, make (with little or no reference to the 121</page><page sequence="4">RECENT STUD IES visual arts as datum) comparative literary comments: L. Nelson, Jr., in Baroque Lyric Poetry (Yale), to be cited below; F. J. Warnke in a volume of translations from European Metaphysical poetry, with an introduction giving large space to the English and the individuality of their variations on continental tech- niques, especially in the case of Donne; H. M. Priest in a similar anthology (Northwestern) whose introduction notes Donne's "special concatenation of elements" resulting from "inescapable dualisms." Two essays nicely focus the problems presented by such approaches: H. Hatzfeld's review (UTQ, 31) of the his- tory of the word "baroque," its recent misuse, and its proper use to denote "an epoch style," and R. Tuve's questioning of the power of such categories to escape the subjective and attain any historical accuracy in the illumination of literary form and decorum-a point at least not unlike that made in this con- nection by Weinberg's lecture (Wisconsin). As to music, G. L. Finney adds three new chapters-one on the effect of science on musical theory covering ground also covered by Palisca (Swarthmore)-to the admired studies now collected in Musical Backgrounds (Rutgers). One curious effect of the arrangement of this material in a book is to underline a nostalgic preoccupation with the destruction of poetry's circular musical myths by science, which makes for an emphasis and effect to be contrasted with those of Hollander's untuning of last year (Princeton). Quite another aspect of the musical background is represented by J. Kerman's study of the Elizabethan motet (SRen, 9), particularly as handled by Byrd, in relation to the religious tensions of the time. III Early Renaissance English humanism this year evoked only one book and a few miscellaneous essays. H. de Vocht provides notes on Erasmus's birth, dispensations, and relations with Ser- vatius and the monastery (Anglia, 79). D. J. Geanakoplos includes in Greek Scholars in Venice, an important background study (Harvard), a detailed account of Erasmus' relations with the Aldus "academy" which goes well beyond Renaudet in detail in clarifying their importance but, strangely, makes no reference whatever to his earlier or later relations with England. To compensate, J. K. Sowards (SRen, 9) speculatively illumi- nates his two lost English years, 1509-1511, suggests why they 122</page><page sequence="5">ARTHUR E. BARKER proved far from the opening of his golden age, outlines their academic occupations, and supposes a sense of the folly of indiscreet satiric bitterness may explain the suppression of the period's letters-two points at which H. C. Porter's account in his Cambridge study might have been useful among the massed authorities. J. J. Rieger (ibid.) shows that the Erasmian Carmina for Paul's express the Christian-humanist theory of moral literary education. G. Kisch studies the influence of Erasmus on the legal concept of equity in Erasmus und die Jurisprudenz (Basler Studien zur Rechtswissenschaft, 56), and K. H. Oelrich, in Der spate Erasmus und die Reformation (Reformationsgeschichtliche. Studien und Texte, 86) his response to the developing Reformation controversies in his later years. R. S. Sylvester and D. P. Harding have produced (Yale) modernized versions (based on the EETS texts) of Cavendish and Roper, with "minimal" notes and an introduction simplify- ing the contrast between scenic fatalism, representing Wolsey's expediency and "tragic" fall, and humane simplicity, revealing More's conscientious moral rectitude, "static" character, com- plicated personality, conflicting obligations, and essential saint- liness, which may confuse the student who does not read Roper himself with care, as he will be confused by the introductory conflation of "Succession" and "Supremacy" and the absence even of such clarification as might have been provided by a reference to More's letter to Cromwell. A. Lynch and L. Bradner print an anonymous, admiring and bitter, epitaph on More (RN, 15). J. Crossett (PQ, 40) explains the relevance to Utopia's less and more civil philosophies of the passage in the pseudo- Senecan Octavia to which it alludes. R. J. Schoeck ( HTR, 54) notes a traditionally mistaken attribution to Chrysostom in the More-Tyndale controversy and by the way usefully summarizes Chrysostom's influence. R. Pineas goes on to review Tyndale's controversial use of history (HTR, 60) and Bale's contributions (SRen, 9). W. A. Clebish (HTR, 60) adds more evidence for Joye's authorship of the disputed Souper. E. Dorenberg's Henry VIII and Luther (Stanford) reviews the controversial exchange and the king's shifting attitudes towards the Lutherans, but the review is insufficiently accurate, detailed, coherent, throws no new light on, for instance, the composition of the Assertio or doctrinal matters, and makes no illuminating use of More. Though with no reference to possible English parallels (about 123</page><page sequence="6">RECENT STUDIES which we may hope to hear later), E. F. Rice, Jr. (SRen, 9) examines, with very full documentation, the Christian-humanist response of Lefevre's group to the early Fathers and illustrates the humanist shift of emphasis in the younger generation. Quite another historical concern is illustrated by F. M. Rogers's con- tribution to current interest in Prester John in The Quest for Eastern Christians (Minnesota), a companion to his earlier account of Dom Pedro, arguing through documentary evidence that the Portuguese explorations were as much motivated by the dream of reunion with near- and far-eastern Christians as by economics. W. Oakeshott discusses some presuppositions illustrated by Renaissance maps of the world (BJRL, 44), and map-making gets some attention in the Boas account of science. Humanist views on the social or political order have had little attention this year. Judith Z. Larson (JEGP, 61) offers a critical interpretation of Skelton's Bowge as combining parody of medieval dream-allegory with dramatic but universalized realism to develop a satiric portrait of the court as an institution. In a volume edited by W. F. McNeir in honor of J. E. Uhler, Studies in English Renaissance Literature (Louisiana State University Studies: Humanities Series, 12), F. A. Abernethy reviews the popular literature of protest against enclosures, de- basing of coinage, vagabondage, from 1485 to 1558. Elisabeth Holmes (RES, 12) discusses the significance of Elyot's revision of The Governour with reference to usage and the dictionary. An interesting light is cast on current arguments about Machiavelli (from More to Marvell) by the collocation of two articles: J. A. Mazzeo's justifying interpretation of "the artist as statesman" (UTQ, 31, 265-282) concerned, after Augustine, with the preservation of the stability and longevity of states through the mitigation of chance and fortune and historical cycles by human foresight and prudence; and Susan Snyder's question (RN, 14) of the influence into the Enlighten- ment of Machiavellian principles drawn from the classics and humanism. The rather different view of man as artist repre- sented by Vives in the Fabula de homine is compared and contrasted with Pico's notion of his dignity by Marcia L. Colish (JHI, 23). Patricia Thomson (HLQ, 25) examines the humanis- tic theme of tranquillity in Wyatt's translation from Plutarch and in the poems, and elsewhere his connection with the Charitean Petrarchans (CL, 13). 124</page><page sequence="7">ARTHUR E. BARKER The discovery that R. Hoopes's Right Reason in the English Renaissance (Harvard) includes but two passing references to Erasmus, one each to Colet and More, and none to Vives, may stagger students of the earlier sixteenth century into a salutary humility, especially since a statement by Bush (with some modifications that should not greatly embarrass that authority) provides a point of departure for this syncretic (both Neoplatonic and Thomistic) account of the right-rational intellectual and actively moral ideal from Plato and Aristotle, through Stoicism and Cicero, Augustine and Thomas, Calvin and Hooker, fideism and scepticism, Taylor and Hobbes, to Milton (or rather, Mil- ton's Raphael) as the last great exemplar. Yet the hiatus is of value in drawing attention to the polarities that may be obscured by rapid philosophical generalization and a simply moralistic approach to Renaissance poetry but seem from Hoopes's study to have presented Renaissance Erasmian (and our neo-Erasmian) Christian humanism with a dilemma. The crucial problems posed for Erasmian idealism by historical and existential actualities are of course central to this year's one full-dress study of the early humanists, R. P. Adams' The Better Part of Valor (University of Washington). Articles that have stimulated discussion since 1941 are expanded and given a larger setting in this presentation, "in its entirety," of the thought on war and peace of "the London Reformers"- i.e., Seebohm modernized, with Colet, More, Vives interpreted from an essentially Erasmian, rational and humanitarian phi- losophy-of-Christ point of view, based in the humanist ideal of a new social (and religious) order. The development and hopeful urging of this Utopian Christian-humanist and philo- sophically unified ideal is now followed through the writings (Lucianic and hortatory) of the goldenly hopeful years between the accession and the full development of the villainously arresting Henry's war policies (underlined by the Lutheran disaster). Though More's efforts to be practical are noted, philosophy seems always to be breaking through to illuminate the bright ideal and obscure murky reality until the humanists are sadly disillusioned, by the apparently inexplicably irrational perversity of men. Yet, less unhappily, the ironies even of the academic life still being what they are, J. Hutton's examination of diplomatic revisions of Erasmian complaints of war by French propagandists in the years following his death (SRen, 125</page><page sequence="8">RECENT STUDIES VIII), with Sowards' explanation above for the suppression of the early golden-years letters, may induce a query as to which is the most applicable of the several dictionary-meanings of "discretion," and to whom. IV This year's very small crop of studies in Elizabethan prose includes the identification of N. Haward's Line of Liberalitie by H. H. Davis (HLQ, 24) as an early translation of De Beneficiis and its comparison with Golding's and Lodge's; the addition of solid new facts to the biography of William Harri- son, author of the Holinshed Description of England, by G. Edelen (SRen, 9); a study of the increasingly confident stylistic revisions in Phillip Stubbes's Anatomie by T. P. Pearson (MLR, 57); and explanation by E. J. Chiasson (SP, 59) of the clothes- philosophy of Swift's Tale in relation to his inheritance of Hooker's mantle as to nature's laws and man's corruption. Hoopes right-rational volume has a section on Hooker which pays rather more attention to the Thomistic former than the Augustinian latter. For the new Folger Documents of Tudor and Stuart Civilization (Cornell) L. B. Wright edits two pieces of moral and prudential advice to a son by Burghley, one more religious and expedient by Raleigh, and one more cynical by Osborne. Though G. K. Hunter's John Lyly (Harvard) is chiefly con- cerned with the plays, it should help to offset the consequences of the "dramatic" and "non-" divisions (not anathematic to Levin alone!); its first two chapters at least are for students of the developing Renaissance among the most important this year in their illuminating commentary on the relation between Elizabethan courtier and earlier humanist (turning largely on Elyot and Ascham of course). When Euphues is set in the sequence indicated by the source of its title, it can be seen as a highly organized (indeed five-act-structured) and far from trivial representation of the education of prodigal quick-wit by experience when it declines to submit to humanist precept. Hunter's account of its place in the process of the frustration and courtierizing of humanism, and of its historically significant relation of a multiplicity of levels of value, deserves to be read with care and admiration as an illustration of a new approach 126</page><page sequence="9">ARTHUR E. BARKER to the literature of the period (related to but much more lucid than Mason's) which is happily supplanting the older ap- proaches he finds inadequate. Another important and full-dress reconsideration, and one badly needed, is G. R. Hibbard's chronological, critical, and historical examination of the writings of Thomas Nashe (Harvard). Despite its detailed account of the context of each work, this is less interesting in not having been able to discern any significant relation between Nashe and the developing and conflicting traditions of his day. He is found, for instance, incapable of discerning any relation between Humanism and Puritanism-he is not alone in that!-or of attaching himself to any tradition, so that his writing is in the end adjudged, not manic-depressive, but as concerned with surface reality and the audience. The authoritative scope and detail of Hibbard's reconsideration may thus induce further consideration. G. G. Harlow was already offering historical identification of the gentleman who had visions and apparitions in The Terrors of Night and commenting on the melancholia of the times (RES, 12). As to reprints and editions, John Hall's Court of Virtue, with its moralizing lyrics, "satiric" poems, and pious parodies of Wyatt and Venus, has been given its first reprinting since its first edition of 1565 (four copies extant) by R. A. Fraser (Rutgers), with a biographical and historical introduction, modernized music, notes explanatory and textual. Miss Campbell's Mirror for Magistrates has been reproduced (without change) from the Cambridge edition of 1938 (Barnes and Noble). Three items have appeared in The Centaur Classics (Southern Illinois): a most handsome and clear facsimile of the limited edition of 1904 of Shakespeare's Ovid edited by W. H. D. Rouse, a reprint of the first (1567) edition of Golding's transla- tion, with a publisher's forward commenting on some recent scholarship (and corecting a mistaken Rouse date) but, it must be regretted, no revision of or addition to the textual notes such as a page or two might have provided to the great satisfaction of scholars; a long-overdue reprint of the Fairfax Jeruslaem De- livered, without the "Life of Godfrey" or the discourse on the "allegorie" or textual or explanatory notes, but with a brief comparative introduction by R. Weiss; (a reprint of Harring- ton's Ariosto is to appear shortly in this series); and fairly generous selections from Holland's Pliny by P. Turner, with 127</page><page sequence="10">R E C E NT S T U D I E S an introduction giving some account of Pliny, Holland, and the poetical use made of them, oriented towards the quaint and "entertaining" but including the moral and social and representative. Elizabeth S. Donno has produced (Columbia) the definitive edition of that fundamental classic, Harrington's Metamorphosis of Ajax, with all the efficient modern conveniences of apparatus through which her wide scholarship illuminates the textual and licensing problems, the easy learning of its facetious satire, and the personal allusions to which not even all contemporaries were privy: a model of editorial scholarship. The late A. Daven- port, gives us, to go along with his Joseph Hall, a much-needed authoritative edition of the early poems of Marston (Liverpool: seen through the press by E. Schanzer), with a very full bio- graphical and critically historical introduction, which should illuminate, among other matters, the tensions between humanis- tic ethics and Calvinism in Marston and his fellows, and very full explanatory notes: with the recent studies by Peter, Kernan, and especially Caputi, a volume that should do much to clarify a peculiarly crucial phenomenon. As was expected, the edition of Sidney's poems by W. A. Ringler, Jr. (Clarendon) proves textually complete and authoritative (save perhaps as to some printed variants), lucidly organizing the stemmata and leading us quite out of the woods we have been in, while providing also a critically biographical introduction (still largely de- pendent for fact on that great Toronto giant of the last age, M. W. Wallace), illuminating the development of Sidney's poetic principles (especially as to verse), with full textual and significant critical commentaries and notes commanding the best recent scholarship-though, since Ringler sides with H. H. Hudson and others, against J. M. Purcell, as to the biographical connections of "Astrophil" with Rich, it is a pity J. Stillinger's close and sceptical study of the documentary evidence (JEGP, 59) came just too late for notice. With Jean Robertson's critical edition of Arcadia in the offing, we may expect our renewed sense of the significance of Sidney's typical example to extend the implications of so many recent studies, such as W. R. Davis's account of the importance for structure and Christian experience of the Arcadian allusion to the Ovidian Actaeon (SEL, 2). This year's one extensive study in Renaissance poetry, The 128</page><page sequence="11">ARTHUR E. BARKER Enduring Monument by O. B. Hardison, Jr. (North Carolina), is a very promising (if not quite sharply unified and oriented) effort, dedicated to the memory of Ruth Wallerstein, to provide a controlled mode of interpretative appraisal through the definition and application to a number of apparently miscellane- ous poems of the formal rhetoric and topics of the traditional epideictic. Its simple insistence that poetic theory and practice need to be related in historical terms (including an acceptance of "didacticism") is refreshing, and its well-documented demon- stration of the pervasive influence of the rhetorically epideictic in Renaissance poetic, even to the schemes of the genres, is persuasive. Without simplifying too dogmatically, it throws light on The Faerie Queene, contrasting poems of Jonson and Donne, and especially on the elegy (with which it must have originated), "pagan" or "Christian" in bearing, culminating in an explication of Donne's Anniversaries. Otherwise the fol- lowing varied items make up the record: P. E. Parnell (JEGP, 60) on Googe's very English and Protestant experiments with pastoral, after Mantuan and in contrast with Petrarchan idealiz- ing; Ann Stanford on Francis Sabie, with reference to detail in his pastoral romance and eclogues (HLQ, 25); Lloyd Berry's printing of the unrevised versions in the Cecil papers of Lycidasian Latin poems by the elder Fletcher (Anglia, 79); S. H. Henderson's account of Neo-Stoicism in formal verse satire from Marston and Hall through Donne (in McNeir's Louisiana volume); J. P. Cutts's reproduction of the settings for two lyrics ascribed to Breton (RN, 15); M. A. Palmatier's suggestion of a source elsewhere in Ovid for Shakespeare's sullen Adonis (HLQ, 24); H. R. Walley's analysis of the developing "rationale of tragedy" in the Rape (though without as yet the contrast with earlier versions that would high-light) (PMLA, 76); an edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets (Basic Books) without apparatus but reproducing in its entirety Oscar Wilde's Mr. W. H. and providing interpretative essays by Blackmur, H. N. Frye, Hubler, Fiedler, Spender, which "arrive at surprisingly various inter- pretations" for the student's enlightenment; J. F. Kermode's consideration of Platonic and Pauline elements in the banquet of sense in Chapman, Shakespeare, Jonson, Marvell (BJRL, 44); G. A. Wilkes' reappraisal of Nosce Teipsum and Orchestra (HLQ, 25); which unhappily could not know R. Krueger's report on the Bodleian manuscript of Davies, containing an 129</page><page sequence="12">RECENT STUDIES epithalamion and a collection of epigrams and making possible deductions as to the confusing "revisions" of Orchestra (RES, 13). Though Spenser elicited no book for a change this year, the following articles show that we be come unto no quiet rode. Form and Convention in . . . Spenser (Columbia) prints papers mostly given for the English Institute in 1959-1960, with an editorial introduction by W. Nelson, commenting on varieties of current efforts to clarify the principles of Spenser's structures. This includes as to the minor poems further com- ments by Hallett Smith on Spenser's eclectic and expressive manipulation of conventions. S. K. Heninger, Jr. (SRen, 9) argues that the form of the Calender depends on the extrapola- tion of a microcosmic seasonal pattern "repeated endlessly throughout eternity" and A. K. Hieatt (in Nelson) adds a seasonal pattern to his earlier temporal interpretation of Epithalamion-though neither quite makes clear how an endless monument can be fashioned in short time. W. F. Staton, Jr., finds Spenser's April lay a dramatic chorus imitating Ronsard (SP, 59). L. L. Martz (in Nelson) argues for the unified harmony of the Amoretti, chiefly with reference to the charac- terization of the woman, love's context in worldly reality and faith, and the movement to the marriage-hymn. In a different context, D. H. Woodward interprets the union of ideal and reality in Prothalamion as a carefully constructed but daring comment on Essex and Elizabeth (ELH, 29), and M. L. Wine sees the refrain as underlining the poem's structural and ethical concern with the uses of mutability (SEL, 2). C. G. Osgood notes echoes from both marriage-poems ringing in P. Fletcher and Donne (MLN, 76). As to The Faerie Queene, Hoopes's version of the Christian- humanist notion of right reason as implying "man reparadised" by a "kind of automatic association" issues once more, especially as to FQ II, in a view of the poem as expressing a harmonious vision or "an easy and untroubled" alliance between nature and grace, which comes into interesting conflict with a sense (unaided by Hamilton, of course) of the poem's insistent reflection of Article IX. The problem is pointed up by the difficulty of deciding, in these terms, when the Arthur of II ceases to be grace and becomes magnanimity-a difficulty perhaps to be cleared by considering that the original interpre- 130</page><page sequence="13">A R T H U R E. BARKER 1 1 tation was mistaken in consequence of the misinterpretation by Hoopes's predecessors of the meaning of Grace-Arthur for Spenser in I. An instance of the sort of new approach to the poem demanded by the state of criticism is provided by P. J. Alphers' perceptively exemplified argument (SEL, 2) that we must read it as operating on the reader's response, not by allegorized narrative, but by persuasive poetic rhetoric which takes precedence over narrative "faults" and pictorialism as the vehicle for its values. There is an as yet unformulated re- lation between such an approach and the ambivalence of artifice and nature discussed by H. P. Guth (PMLA, 76) who, like M. MacLure last year (UTQ, 28), clears ground much confused by C. S. Lewis though partially cleared earlier by Brooke. A. Hamilton is developing another line of attack (in Nelson) in comparing and contrasting Langland's Christian metaphor with Spenser's in his first two books. D. Baker (MLN, 76) is concerned with the inaccuracies of the "Letter" as to plot, especially for II. R. A. Bryan (ibid., 104-106) associates the death of the offspring of Error in I with the deaths of Arius and Judas. J. W. Schroeder (ELH, 29) adds to recent moral and ecclesiastical interpretations of Orgoglio an erotic plane very firmly argued out but capable of reducing, rather than erecting, the levels of meaning if improperly used. A. Fowler (N&amp;Q, 7) reports on more early marginalia to I in the Bodleian, tending to confirm its historical concern with the church. M. A. Mansalaoui (ibid.) finds a source for Alma in Augustine's Confessions. S. Snyder (RN, 14) finds "Guyon" means "wrestler" among other possibilities, and sees an as- sociation with "George." A. K. Hieatt (PMLA, 77, 509-510) explains Amoret's difficulties in terms of Scudamour's aggres- siveness. J. V. Holleran (in McNeir) explains Braggadochio's thematic and dramatic function. H. Berger (in Nelson) explains VI as turning on the effort of poetry to cope with, while tran- scending, reality, and S. Hawkins (ibid.) persuasively and sensitively argues that the pessimistic interpretation of Muta- bilitie springs from failure to recognize the ironically ordering process represented in the cycle of the months-two essays which suggest how we may in the end find an issue out of all our Spenserian afflictions. Meanwhile W. F. McNeir and G. F. Provost provide an annotated bibliography of studies (Du- quesne). 131</page><page sequence="14">RECENT STUDIES v For the earlier seventeenth century the most important recent event is of course the appearance of the revised version of Bush's Oxford volume. This renders obsolete the 1945 volume, not only as to bibliography but as to pagination, through the re- vision of miscellaneous factual detail, some reordering (es- pecially in the poetical parts, where Chapman is separated from Donne), and the recasting of commentary (sometimes phraseological, sometimes substantial) in the light of current scholarship. Donne apart (later), Jacobean and Caroline prose fared no better than Elizabethan, though their were flurries as to Bacon and Browne. F. I-H. Anderson adds to his authoritatively technical work on Bacon's philosophy a full (and spiritedly epideictic) account of Bacon's public career and philosophic writings (Southern California, through University Publishers). Its sympathetic narrative of Bacon's endeavors and explication of his three segregated kingdoms (of nature, politics, grace) will be illuminating to students untrained in philosophical techni- calities, for (though "imagination" appears only on the last page and "poetry" not at all, there being no space for such dreams of learning) Bacon's thinking is set in his immediate, rather than prophetic, context and (particularly in the final chapter) lucidly discriminated from, say, Descartes's or related to Campanella's, the effect of the whole being to suggest to a merely literary mind that Bacon's immediate, pre-Royal- Society literary significance needs reassessment, especially in terms of analogies (as well as segregations) such as are vaguely suggested in B. Farrington's slighter account, just reprinted (Collier Books). As to Bacon's inductive originality, R. E. Larsen (JHI, 23) sides with Cohen against Anderson as to the debt to Aristotelian and medieval logic and Platonized forms. Jones in his new preface and Boas in a chapter on the reorganization of science (see above) are chiefly concerned with Cowley's Bacon. Two studies of Browne demand comparison: Joan Bennett's (Cambridge) and F. L. Huntley's (Michigan). Both modify the old "divided-and-distinguished" view, by examining Browne's life and character (using recent findings like N. J. Endicott's in UTQ, 30) and the attitudes and ideas of his works in series 132</page><page sequence="15">A R TH U R E. B A RK E R rather than his style. Bennett extensively reviews his corre- spondence, has sensible (if not well contexted) comments on his view of the church and four-fold biblical contradictions, is inclined to underline his uncertainty, following Digby's criti- cism of the "personal element" and leaving the handling of Scripture at the level of mere "allegory," but emphasizes the importance of his embryological experiments as at once con- tributing to a dualistic polarity and a sense of man's place in the scale, and has a sensitive response to his response to God's providential art as it relates to the Christian tradition's in- heritance from Plato and Plotinus (though not, apparently, Augustine) and hence of "analogies"5 on various designed levels (including, with some hesitation, the ethical). Huntley finds his clues in the formative years of Browne's education and in the contemplation of persecution and a miraculous escape from drowning in the Irish visit; hence a doubtful sense of corres- pondences (sustained chiefly by biology), a sense of history (immediately in Hall's Norwich) as a labyrinth of providential art and human perversity, a sense of nature's deiformity and mutability, neither fideist nor sceptic but, in man's limited per- ception, joined by metaphor and (what Huntley gets a little more clearly than Bennett) the "charity" of Christian morals. It is interesting that Bennett can see no relation between Urne and Garden and thinks the Letter illustrates the tension between fact and literary elaboration, while Huntley repeats his lengthy explication of the letter and relates the other two (with a reference to the Annitersaries) in terms of knowledge's limita- tions and (if one may so put it) unceasing emergence from the pit. Both passingly relate Browne to his contemporaries (especially Donne and Milton, more Neo-platonically than toughly read), and together they nicely illustrate the exantla- tion of our critical truth. P. Janelle (EA, 15) adds to Denonain's textual critique of Religio (which Bennett effectively uses at one point) notes on 1643 variants not only more academic and literary but indicating (what Bennett and Huntley might have stressed more) fidelity to Hooker and a melancholy sense of Laudian-Parliamentary conflict. W. Whallon analyzes Browne's stylistic manipulation of Hebraic synonomy (ELH, 28), also touched on by Huntley. For the rest, J. Freeman's edition of Fuller's Worthies has been republished (Barnes and Noble); J. R. Simon (EA, 15) l"so</page><page sequence="16">R14RECENT STUDIES examines corrupted readings in successive editions of the Anatomy of Melancholy; F. Manly (MLN, 76), though still misled as to "rakehell Jack," finds an Augustinian echo from a Donne sermon in the opening reference of The Compleat Angler to scriptural inspiration; D. B. Sailor discusses Cud- worth's response to Descartes's errors (JHI, 23) and R. A. Greene, Robert Boyle's refutation of Henry More's demonstra- tion through physics of immaterial spirit (ibid.). J. D, Charron provides a comprehensively apologetic account of the Wisdom of P. Charron, its influence and critics (North Carolina). Hoopes finds Taylor eminently right-rational in a disintegrating Baconian world, and (though "the argument may appear circular") the Cambridge Platonists affording the last great version of the moral absolutes of Christian rationalism. For seventeenth-century poetry W. R. Keast has edited a representative and varied series of critical essays since Grierson (Oxford, Galaxy) and Helen Gardner a similar volume for Donne (Prentice-Hall). The introductions of Warnke and Prest have already been mentioned. M. R. Ridley's Studies in Three Literatures (Dent) adds to most perceptive comments on the typical qualities of Latin, Greek, English, sensitive com- parisons of love- and nature-lyrics in the three, including several of ours with their models (though perhaps not entirely perceptively as to Donne). G. Williamson adds to his Contexts a lucidly written account of The Proper Wit of Poetry from the Jacobeans through the Augustans (Chicago), tracing the emergence from rhetoric of ingenuity in thought, image, at- titude, and exemplifying its variations in practice in what looks like a series of witty antitheses, from Greville and Donne to Marvell and Waller. Dudley North's complaints about witty poetry (1645), as reprinted by L. A. Beaurline (HLQ, 25) belong on the Greville-Drummond side of this rhythm (though not necessarily with Sidney-Milton). With Williamson's grace- fully wise book may be compared Poetry and the Fountain of Light by H. R. Swardson (a former student of Unger's). With- out much sense that it is renewing old and untransfigured notions about the gap between poetry and dogma, secular and sacred, Hellenistic and Hebraic, pietas and salvation (both highly simplified), and with little appreciation of recent critical efforts to get beyond these, this sets out to review Herrick, Herbert, Marvell and Milton as variously dichotomized, but 134</page><page sequence="17">ARTHUR E. BARKER proves interesting through its resistance to its own perception of relations-Herrick's liturgical naturalism, Herbert's religious wit, Marvell's artful prophecy, though Milton is a bogey-as indicated by its own sensitive explications. It will be interesting to see how this situation develops. This year's record is far from indicating that Donne is "ob- viously slipping." Indeed there are signs that the critical reorientation is about to clarify itself sharply, in line with what is suggested by the most notable (though firmly reserved) of Bush's revisions. The terms of the problem are perhaps indi- cated by two contiguous articles: B. H. Whitlock's consideration (ES, 43) of Donne's university years, their impeccable associa- tions, and serious study's provision, for a primarily social and virtually coterie poetry, of varied imagery and allusion (two instances of which are pinned down by G. B. Evans, MLR, 57); and R. A. Bryan's account of the prevailing popularity of his witty rather than serious poems, as illustrated by seventeenth- century commonplace books (ES, 43). V. Harris presents another aspect of the problem (PQ, 51) by collecting Donne's comments on the theatre (comparable to those of Sasek's Puritans) to show that theatrical illusion is for him consistently a contempt- ible reflection of the world's illusion in general, for Harris another instance of an age all in pieces. J. A. Levine (ELH, 28) reads "The Dissolution" as a twofold, sexual and mortality elegy, with an inclination to put the stress on (ungenerative) sex. But D. C. Allen traces the ship metaphor of the poems and sermons from Aeschylus through Cicero to Augustine, though he tacks back to Ovid; W. R. Mueller find the battered town-heart in Hosea; and R. F. Fleisnner the prime association for the compasses in Dante's circle of love (all in MLN, 76). R. A. Bryan (JEGP, 61, 305-312) finds that the witty poems consistently use the orthodox Anathema as condemnation of soul, body, and all worldly possessions. Though L. Nelson's "baroque" does little to clarify principles of explication already suggested by others, its comments on some of the Songs and Sonets highlight the "instantaneousness" of Donne's rhetorical "dramicality," and invite one to consider whether it is not already clear that Donne had a sharper sense of the relation between poet, persona, audience, (and perhaps even norm) than here appears. It would be interesting to have an explanation of the complexity of his extension of "the revolu- 135</page><page sequence="18">RECENT STUDIES tionary change in the rhetorical situation" achieved by "baroque," especially since this extension seems sharply under- lined by comparison with Gryphius, Marino, even Theophile. Without resort to "baroque," Arnold Stein's study of Donne's lyrics (Minnesota), after reviewing suggestively the critical shift from conceits through rhetoric to the "whole poem," reconsiders the play of stylistic stresses and the forms of ironic wit in a number of sensitively and closely read "earlier" Songs and Sonets and some religious poems, to illustrate Donne's "celoquence of poetic action," in which spontaneity and thought sustain a process of imaginative consciousness whereby con- trarities are, if not resolved, at least illuminated. Stein's distate for the rigidly historical or rhetorical or theological (and aware- ness of their relevance) expresses itself in an inclination to perplex his own critical security with doubt; and it is a question whether stress on Donne's "private anguish" and the dualisms that prevent him from mysticism can be reconciled with a "Plotinian" resolution of the conflict between reality and poetry, external and internal, which makes the Anniversaries seem, briefly, "uneven masterpieces" (despite or on account of Donne's concern for the world?); but the directions scrupulously indi- cated are significant. Hardison's structurally and intentionally reappraising account of the Anniversaries as formally and topically epideictic (rather than devotional) is worth close attention, since we need to recognize that Donne's effects, however we value them, depend on a strong sense of traditional form and decorum, and may thus, with Hardison, approach more securely his "ideal" through his method of persuasion. Donne's prose has had several important studies this year. The completion of the Simpson-Potter volumes is accompanied by the appearance of W. R. Mueller's John Donne: Preacher (Princeton), a competent and comprehensive introduction. While initially concerned, like Stein, with the "habitually introspective"-what a pity popular psychology has not pro- vided us with "extrospective" and simply "spective!"-and subject to a Waltonian uneasiness about Donne's relations with the divided virtual beams of the churches and with James as to church and state (a matter Hooker alone will not clarify). this gives a good account of Donne's sense of his calling, his themes, his "metaphysical" (or, as even Williamson indicates, "biblically paradoxical") imagery, and the elements of his 136</page><page sequence="19">ARTHUR E. BARKER theology. Its very excellence as a survey indicates that we need to know more about the formal rhetoric of the homiletic tradi- tion Donne inherits, about the literal and figurative handling of texts (which four-foldedness confusingly simplifies), and about Donne's by no means "unsystematic" theology-especially as to original sin and grace, obscured in this case, as with Milton, by an inclination to resort to "the paradox of the fortunate fall" to provide an escape from all our interpretative woe. To make sense of the doctrine of resurrection (which Mueller rightly emphasizes, thereby offsetting the wormy tra- dition given recorded authority by the somewhat lugubrious Herbert Marshall), it is necessary to inquire very exactly in what sense "Adam's fall, it would seem, is a by no means an unmitigated evil," and thus to prevent our inclination to inter- pret "mitigation" in a modern, untheological and irresponsible sense which distorts the Donnean and Miltonic view of the existential situation. Several of these desiderata are in hand in recent articles. In what is perhaps the year's outstanding article on any subject, Joan Webber (Anglia, 79) despite an inclination shared by Stein and Mueller to regret that Donne is not mystical (why regret it?), analyzes the threefold stylistic and metaphorical modes of the tripartite divisions of Donne's cyclically emergent Devotions. With a true wit that reminds one of Johnson's definition, and with an intelligent and sensitive (if somewhat Platonizing) awareness of the perfectly intelligible pattern of Donne's religious experience and relations with the Church of England, she-a Gentlewoman, by the by, whom this eulogist has never seen-shows syntactically that Donne's meditations are roughly and curtly Senecan, his expostulations restlessly Augustinian and confessional, his prayers periodic Ciceronian Anglican, and that the stages in the process so exemplified in- volve related variations in the handling of naturalistic and biblical metaphor. This excellent article, with its perceptive relating and discriminating of Donne's process and the "medi- tational," indicates what is to be expected of her forthcoming (Wisconsin) study of the Contrary Music of Donne's prose. Without any context (save a reference to El Greco), W. J. J. Rooney (TSLL, 4) carefully analyzes the style of a Donne sermon in terms of the apparent gap between logical organiza- tion and almost "melodramatic" exemplary execution. D. B. 137</page><page sequence="20">RECENT STUDIES Quinn (JEGP, 61), with discriminating reference to Augustine, Lyra, Bernard, usefully reviews and illustrates Donne's prin- ciples of exegesis in terms of his somewhat "unsystematic" Anglican balance between reason and faith. Irving Lowe (JHI, 22) examines Donne's middle way between scepticism and fideism in this latter connection in the sermons. An article by I. Sowton, which has not received adequate notice (and would have saved Mueller, though Gardner did not, from a Griersonian ecclesiological lapse in phrasing: 158) effectively gathers and interprets Donne's epistolary comments on "catholicity" and the problem of the divided churches (Canadian Journal of Theology, 6, 1960). Another former Torontonian, A. E. Malloch (SEL, 2, 57-76) brilliantly illuminates a matter central to all this: Donne's theory of conscience and distaste for a "Romish" casuistry separating knowledge from moral judgment. Save for Milton, and for W. Trimpi's full study of Jonson's poems and plain style (Stanford), the rest of the period's poets received only articular treatment. Trimpi is somewhat behind- hand in his simplified view of Donne as antithesis to Jonson, and does not have Webber's sense of the varied articulation of styles (despite his response to Vives and the tradition of mingled style); but, like Webber, he significantly modifies the school- styles that frame his exposition of Jonsonian stylistic principles and the timbers from which they were formed, their illustration in Jonson's critical opinions of ancients and contemporaries and especially in his poems, lyric, satiric, complimentary, elegiac, and so on. The account of critical theory is admirably grounded in classical and humanist comment and, importantly, in the continuity of the native tradition; everywhere in the ap- praisal of the poems, the sense of relation between style and attitude to what is being imitated makes for precise and signifi- cant explication, in a way that demonstrates what can be achieved through historical clarity by a sensitively ordered mind. (See also PMLA, 77.) The neglected and relatively simple religious dimension Trimpi touches on is (in Mazzeo's Nicolson volume) the concern of M. K. Starkman on Herrick's Noble Numbers with their acceptance of God's ways and merg- ing of didactic, affective, meditational, domestic, and naturalistic strains, in a rational and liturgical received-sense, worth this appreciative appraisal and contrast with Herbert. F. Bowers (MP, 59) and J. D. Walker (ELH, 29) plot the ground-plan 138</page><page sequence="21">ARTHUR E. BARKER of The Temple, one as to sequential imagery (especially "tem- pering"), the other as to the progress of the soul (through images of Hebraic temple and cosmology). G. M. Story re- ports a manuscript of Herbert's Inventa Bellica (MP, 62). In a very neat little volume, the first of a series that other university presses should have the wit to imitate (Kentucky), Mary E. Rickey analyzes, not Crashaw's imagery, but the structural and associative significance of his rhymes. She has a similar delicately perceptive essay on the schematized verse of Vaughan, following Herbert (SP, 59). E. L. Marilla (in McNeir's Louisiana volume) reviews recent criticism of the Metaphysicals, especially (in line with his recent work) as it bears on Vaughan. J. D. Simmonds considers Vaughan's handling of the tensions involved in the great chain of being and the individual's situa- tion in that respect (in the McNeir volume), clarifies in a related essay (SEL, 2) the dramatic objectivity of Vaughan's World in terms of devotion under grace (cf. and cs. Olson, CL, 13), and deals with Olor Iscanus and earlier suppressed poems (MLN, 76; MLQ, 22). The winged chariot has covered much ground since the Bradbrook-Thomas Marvell, now reprinted with some correc- tions and a brief note on some later essays (Cambridge). Caro- line Robbins (JHI, 23) speculates as to Marvell's religion. M. R. Pitman (RES, 13) finds the corruption of nature in the mower's garden reminiscent of Wotton and Alberti; G. Williamson finds the context of Marvell's Hortus and Garden in Cowley and Evelyn (MLN, 76). But attention is still focussed on Marvell's Cromwell: to his Machiavellian Cromwell and Augustinian Machiavel, Mazzeo (in the Nicolson volume) now adds Cromwell as Davidic king in the anniversary poem and elegy, with a full (and not always obviously relevent) account of the figural tradition and an effort to explain the "odd" relation of the political realism of the ode to this apocalyptic mode through a relation of Machiavelli's political theory with Augustine on the mysterious workings of providence-an argument of which not even the bare bones can appear here. J. M. Wallace (MLN, 76) finds the "lusty mate" of the anniversary poem has behind him a tradition running from Plato through Tertullian, Plutarch and Horace and Lucan through the disputes over tyrannicide, a context to be added to Syfert's slightly earlier (RES, 12) inter- pretation of the ambiguous echoes of Lucan and Horace in the 139</page><page sequence="22">R E C E NT STUDIES ode. The ode is firmly set by Wallace (PMLA, 77) in its im- mediate context of desperate political theory, with its classical and humanistic background, and its rhetorical effort to contain practical necessity "within a total view of divine order" under such circumstances, in an article that will deserve the respectful interest of the editors of the Yale Milton's Prose IV (though Wallace seems less at home than one would expect with the Miltonic literature on the subject). R. G. Baldwin (PQ, 40) has a spirited defence of Phineas Fletcher against recent piecemeal interpretation and as a val- uable storehouse of conventional Renaissance ideas. Another Canadian, A. Pritchard (SP, 59) explains Wither's career in terms of his "grossly mistaken" identification of poetry and prophecy, inherited from Du Bartas (but not, surely, from Sidney, unless Wither read Sidney down to the level of some current critical historians!). And C. Hilberry has admirably edited the poems of John Collop (Wisconsin), in which an average intelligence, and imaginative powers about on a level with the modern academic average, reflect nearly everything in the period, from the satiric and "Seraphick" Donne to Crom- wellian summum jus, the last an irony of simple-mindedness worth the Marvellians' notice. VI Miltonic heads and pens have certainly this year been musing, searching, revolving new notions and ideas, even to a rarity and admiration, suggesting that some of them think they have be- come prophets. J. R. Martin (Princeton) argues unconvincingly that the crayon recently given his university is an original Faithorne rather than a copy of the engraving. H. F. Fletcher's Intellectual Development, II (Illinois), follows Milton through Cambridge from '25 to '32 in massive detail, reviewing all the writings of these years in the light of the university and tutorial programs, from religious instruction, through English, Latin, logic, ethics, physics, metaphysics, theology, and the rhetoric of disputation (set in its educational and controversial context). Among much else, the principal importance of this volume lies in the reconstruction of the tutorial process based on Holdsworth's Directions (printed in an appendix) and Mead's accounts of book-buying (a happy parallel), which, independ- ently of M. H. Curtis (who scamped Cambridge while using Holdsworth) and H. C. Porter (who did not), makes plain 140</page><page sequence="23">A RTHUR E. BARKER the general and especialy Miltonic intellectual and literary significance of aims and methods ignored by earlier university historians. Fletcher elsewhere, appropriately, records his thwarted but clarifying efforts to identify (JEGP, 60) "old Damitis.'" In the Fletcher Festschrift (JEGP, 60, No. 4; hereafter FIF) E. Sirluck is incidentally concerned (like Fletcher) with the dating of early poems, as an opening gambit with the poetical silences of the prose years, and centricly to show that these result from frustration by Mary (though we are of course spared Masson's step-on-the-stairs and Sergeant Lamb's psychiatric fancies) and a sense of guilt springing from the breaking of an inspirational virginity-pledge dated (against Tillyard and others) down to "about 1637" and connected with the Mask and the pastoral elegies, a poetically paralyzing guilt not offset till the boon of blindness. Sirluck's tight and persuasive argu- ment (which of course outdoes Tillyard and even Woodhouse as to virginal infusions of grace) illuminates many Miltonic problems; but it should be noted that it depends at bottom on two unclarified evidential assumptions: i) that the "confused") conflation of apocalyptic "palmers" and the "undefiled" in Damon's elegy (769) differs radically from the singing of the Solemn Music's mere "palmers" who are said to depend entirely on Rev. 7, not at all on Rev. 14; and ii) that, as to the Music, one may silently substitute "sing with a loud voice" (763) for the reading in all texts and translations for Rev. 7-"cried" or "crying" (Milton and NEB, "shout"). Perhaps the expressive conflation of the shouting and singing of palmers and undefiled in both poems results from Milton's reading of the Apocalypse as representing a process moving towards the ultimate situation his high-raised fantasy envisages. At any rate, while the Lady, King, and Didoati may be presumed virginal, NEB, quite rightly, describes the undefiled simply as "chaste," and one ought to go back to the sixth elegy's casta iuventus (unglossed by Sirluck) and begin again before connecting with Mary intricacies originating in the Pauline and Johannine texts. As to the silences, as Sirluck should know for several reasons, there was a seemingly endless and controversial war on. Among the early poems, L'Allegro and II Penseroso are dichotomized again by E. Tate (MLN, 76) and are treated musically by Finney along with others (in Mazzeo and the book). J. B. Broadbent's edition of Comus and Samson Agonistes 141</page><page sequence="24">RECENT S T UDIES Tor schools (Barron's) will induce dispute in pupils who venture beyond its inedaquate bibliography on account of its discon- nected comments on the genre and the "rationalized mystique of chastity." J. M. Steadman (PMLA, 77) argues etymologically that "haemony" simply means "knowledge." T. B. Stroup (SEL, 2) and C. H. Shattuck (FIF) examine eighteenth- and nineteenth-century versions of the mask, and J. Arthos (MLN, 76), without reference to recent comments, finds its epilogue ontologically Platonic but unschematized. Without reference to any other more or less baroque commentators, and in terms that will trouble more critics than Miss Tuve, L. Nelson analyzes the tenses of Christ's Nativity to illustrate the circularity of final serenity after ecstatic joy, and the temporality and rhetorical dramicality of Lycidas to show how pagan and Christian am- bivalences are reconciled finally in Christian paradox. J. S. Lawry demonstrates, with well-supported brevity and point, the clear dialectic whereby the poem progressively develops its Christian implications (PMLA, 77), while Finney renders it Orphic. C. A. Thompson has an at least novel association for the apocalyptic two-handed engine (SP, 59). T. E. Maresca (MLN, 76, 491-494) annotates Latona's associations. A. Goss- man and G. W. Whiting continue with F. Pyle (RES, 12, 364- 372) the current dispute over Milton's blinded mood, as to which Sirluck (above) has some relevant comments. W. B. Hunter (PQ, 40) connects the translation of psalms with the Reformation tradition of psalters and the activities of the West- minster Assembly. Milton's reaction against Arthur and romance is discussed by W. Haller (for Mazzeo's Nicolson) and G. Williamson (MP, 60). M. Kelley identifies Areopagitica's nameless discourse that perverted Arminius (MLN, 76). D. M. Wolfe (FIF) re- views the limits of Miltonic toleration, in contrast with the Levellers's or Williams's, but finds no explanation. The most important contribution as to the prose is of course M. Y. Hughes' virtually single-handed production of Yale III: 1649. The expected fullness and detail of its historical introductions, as to situation, occasion, background of political theory, and of its annotations, can of course get no just appraisal here. Mil- ton's additions and revisions of 1650 being what they are, there may again be complaints that the textual machinery is not sufficient; but this is no doubt a matter of the project's general 1r42</page><page sequence="25">ARTUHUR H. BARKER editorial policy. Some points that may be noted here are the firm handling of Milton's relation with Hooker as to the social contract, the commanding annotation as to Ireland, the precise thoroughness with which Dugard and Pamela are disposed of, the fact that a comment of Lilburne's on Milton (especially considering its circumstances and bearing; see P. Gregg, 313) still seems weak support for lining up Milton's political theories and sympathies with the Levellers, and the likelihood that at least some students will be perplexed (es- pecially after Yale II) by the absence of any account of the possible bearing of Milton's notions about Christian liberty on his politics and his intolerance. K. Svendsen (FIF) produced even more documentary evidence for Milton's informed veracity in the attack on More. Barbara K. Lenralski (HLQ, 24), neatly playing off one half-quoted commentator against another as usual, and somewhat tentatively excusing Milton in terms of the "rhetorical pressures" or controversial tactics of 1659, finds the Hireling view of learning reflecting his old "dilemma" as to the natural and spiritual. (As to background, cf. Jones for Mazzeo's Nicolson.) An article by Peter F. Fisher (JHI, 23) argues that the refined technicalities of the Logic show how Milton moved, with Ramism, from a rationalist to a voluntarist position as to the intuitive perception of logical relations and right reason. In his important, closely reasoned argument (based chiefly on Milton's exegetical doctrine and practice in De Doctrina) H. R. MacCallum questions (UTQ, 31) recent loose habits of figurative, allegorical, metaphorical sprit-versus- letter interpretation, shows conclusively that Milton was far from the Neoplatonic excesses of Origen, with which he is sometimes mistakenly associated, and in line with the Pauline and Augustinian law-gospel, or outward-letter-versus-inwardly- effectual-spirit of Luther and Calvin, and demonstrates that (to summarize inadequately) he distrusted metaphor and typology as instruments of religious knowledge except when strictly Biblical and interpreted in terms of his simply direct version of scriptural accomodation and example. This is, in detail and even in its admissions of loopholes, a salutary warning as to what Milton thought of the danger of enslavement by the symbol-making, ordering imagination; but it is to be regretted that, so far, it leads merely to the negative conclusion that Milton on Scripture "can at best provide only an uncertain E43</page><page sequence="26">RECENT STUDIES guide" to Milton as poet as we follow him with wandering steps and slow, and to attacks on the pioneer typological vague- ness of the late F. M. Krouse and the undifferentiated Christian- platonizing of Hanford, Willey (and Miss Tuve?). Calvin, Forstman reminds us, had problems: one wants to know how, positively, Milton handled his, not how wrong everbody has been. But there is some promising agreement with R. M. Frye. This year will be memorable for the number of its books on Paradise Lost, and for their diversity. For Hoopes Milton's is the last great voice of right-rational and ethical Christianity, merging Plato, Thomas, Reformation, Renaissance, in his conception of natural reason as rendering man potentially divine and as operating discursively in "truly regenerate and Christian purity of life" (but not in Baconians) consistently with Raphael's intuitive reason. Swarsdon, a confessedly "hostile" reader who can use Bush to support Raleigh, Willey, Waldock, is of course representative of a common state of the funda- mentalist Platonic mind in finding both epics representative of Hebraic-Hellenic dualism, Urania split between the "mysti- cal" voice of Christian inspiration and the classical tradition, and theology and omnipotence in conflict with primitivisitic and epic grandeur (and with patience). It is interesting that, after reviewing (not without point) the inadequacies of several recent sorts of attempts to make coherent sense of Paradise Lost, he admits that he (and these) have dealt only with the framework, not with the subject, of the poem. It seems always desirable to determine, to begin with, what a poem is about; but, at the moment, Swardson would no doubt go on (unless he takes better counsel and reads more widely) to the dicho- tomies of Milton's heroism. At first sight, Swarsdon's condes- cension towards the dualistic hobgoblins of Miltonic muddle would seem to have no counterpart in D. P. Harding's detailed interpretation, in The Club of Hercules (Illinois), of many known and some new classical allusions in Paradise Lost (especially to Ovid and Virgil) as not merely pedantic or descriptive but organically interpretative-by which Harding, following Yeats, means "emotive." As in an account of Pan- demonium's bees elsewhere (FIF), the web of associative al- lusion is carefully unravelled in a series of instances, to show, for instance, how it induces our ambivalent response to Satan as classical hero and then (against Waldock) our sense of 144</page><page sequence="27">A R T HUR E. BARK E R his monstrous perversion of an ideal. But in the case of our first parents, such allusions are found to provide a "clandestine discrediting" by the poet of the original "innocence" the theologian must maintain, practised to prevent a pysychological failure of the poem at its focal point, which is threatened by the conflict between the neo-classical poet and the theologian's quietist response to "the Christian paradox," and thus requires the degrading of innocent man and his Creator, not to mention the Manichean supposition that Satan controls the action. Harding's very illuminating explications miss the real ironies of Milton's allusive method-perhaps because, though there are relevant scattered references, he pays little attention to their tenor after a prefatory reference to the other great literary tradition sustained by school and college New Testament Greek (cf. Fletcher, II, 273-288). It may be suspected that every one of the passages in which he rightly finds a web of classical allusion also involves a web of Scriptural allusion which is not practised to deceive, and further that there must be something radically wrong with a psychology, poetic, and interpretation of Milton's Christianity that reduces his concern with providence to the level of rhetorical Virgilian "reassurance" and leaves unexplained his flight above the Aonian mount-through failure to make it clear that Milton's right hand is wielding Samson's club. D. Bush (FIF) briefly (and with due caution) explains the "fusions of the Hebraic and the classical" in some of Milton's allusive and structural ironies. In discussing the isolation of renaissance heroes (for Mazzeo's Nicolson) he of course deals with Milton's-who, as a matter of fact, are a good deal less isolated than anybody's, save for Spenser's. Ridley, with a classically-trained sense of Virgil's limitations, finds Milton "incomparably finer"5 as an artist and makes nice Addisonian discriminations of his excellences (despite an inclination to trip over the uncleared poetic-theological trap). J. I. Cope's Metaphoric Structure of Paradise Lost (Johns Hopkins) provides a stunning climactic example of what (re- membering Henry Reynolds) we may term the recent "mythomystic" effort to escape from our Miltonic dilemma by discarding the poem's stated theme and plot as irrelevant poetically and leaving half of it unsung (even in the terms of MacCaffrey's reconstructive afterthoughts). Cope repudiates not only systematic theology and discursive reason and ethics 145</page><page sequence="28">RECENT S TU D I ES but the Aristotelian plot-structure of the poem itself in order to escape from the temporal limitations (which were imposed by Milton's God) of the processive and attain through imagistic mimesis the timeless (and painless) spatiality that makes the poem "a metaphoric circle without a center" through the radical interdependence of Heraclitean paradox and metaphor. With Cassirer (but not Auerbach) as guide, this makes it possible to dispose of "history" in any sense, for time is the destroyer and the product of Satan's usurpation of space which caused God choicelessly to invent it, the Son (not "Christ" as is Cope's habit) a choiceless incarnation, and Eve (created weak) a virtually choiceless Fall (Adam's, at the center, is ignored consequence). It also makes possible complete interpretative freedom in the glossing of "paradoxes" in terms of vertical ascents and descents on the scala paradisa of mythic imagism (Biblical or otherwise) in interchangeable terms (after Alien) of light and darkness (though, flatly, there is no need for night in heaven, despite Milton, or anywhere, presumably, for its friendliness to "sleep and silence"). This ranges from the explication of trivial puns to a reading of sex as the chief image of evil carried back into the original pregnant brooding and so making God of necessity frustrated in creation, whence escape is provided by "the mythic circle of the fortunate fall," "the felix culpa which brings 'life out of death' "-an astonishing feat of telescopy which must certainly be regarded as taking the cake and eating it too. What is of real interest in Cope's exposition is its brilliant illustration of the limiting difficulties modern criticism of this sort meets (see the opening chapters) in attempting to resolve problems inherited from the metaphori- cal epistemology of seventeenth-century Christianity while denying its disciplined premises. Miss Mohl writes of the theme of the epic with refreshingly direct humanity in a new preface to her Studies; and W. Schumaker concludes some remotely anthropological considera- tions of the power of its mythological dimension with (what might better have been the beginning) some sound points relating to the explanation of its energeia such as he suspects our sense of psychic danger to ourselves in Milton makes us ignore that we may resist him. Perhaps the explanation is that his insistence on the need for faithful self-discipline under in- escapable woe disturbs our mythic self-image. 146</page><page sequence="29">ARTHUR E. BARKER It is interesting to compare two mature "introductions" to the epic (for English common-readers and American students; neither with scholarly documentation): B. A. Wright's (Barnes and Noble) and J. H. Summers' (Harvard). They indicate where common sense presently stands. Wright deals bluntly with the moral: this is a theological epic; hierarchy and sub- ordination are established by God as a lawful monarch; the Fall is disobedience to the instinct of natural Hookerian reason. Summers is less blunt, but the poem has a moral concern, reflects life, though not directly concerned with life as we know it, the muses method being the creation of movement in space and time since motion manifests the divine vitality and Milton is not concerned with conventional dichotomies but with the harmonious working of wills and fruitful motion, direct or reflected light or the two great sexes, foreshadowing recon- ciliation in "grateful vicissitudes." The Fall, sin being a failure of love, substitutes "anxious" and "lust." Both comment sen- sitively on style: Wright on the currency and concreteness of the Latinisms, on the functional similes (though he is behind the recent North-American comments he does not know, save in demonstrating that the geographical names have immediate seventeenth-century associations), and on economy of organic syntax; Summers on imagery not abstractible from the concep- tual (Milton rejoices in Biblical anthropomorphism), on shap- ing syntax and verse. Wright deems Milton fundamentally optimistic, as through Raphael, but has almost nothing to say of the Redeemer. Summers underlies the rising and falling rhythm of loss and triumph by which the falls become part of the divine rhythm and Eve echoes the redeeming voice. Wright, for whom sin must be conscious and willing, is at pains to show that the fatal train of events does not impugn Eve's prelapsarian innocence despite the liability to fall, underlines Adam's fall in contrast to Eve's and makes redemption turn on him. Summers finds it difficult to say just when the decision is made (though reluctant to follow the anticipators) and finds inexplicable the failure of the memory of happiness which should prevent the fall, though innocent Eve has no way of detecting the Serpent's lie. Since Summers' fruitful motion seems to fade out in XI and XII, he is uneasy about them and the muse's mazes become somewhat vaguely typological. Wright is not far behind: the last two books humanize in a way, but one 147</page><page sequence="30">R ECE N T S T U D I E S dislikes Adam's moralizing, and they are not within the action made impressive by Milton's narrative art (Addison?). Neither displays any architechtonic sense, though both comment on parrallel or parody; and both reorder Milton's material for expository purposes, Wright in 7 sections (suggesting the Satanic, the Creative, Adam and Eve as central), Summers in 8 (sug- gesting that the rhythm is the pattern at the center). Wright thinks Satan "tragic" (Gardner), but does not think of the poem as in any sense dramatic. Summers dislikes "genre criticsm" because it seems to him static, and argues against "structure" because it may imply one principle of organization fading out particulars; but it is difficult to tell what this means because, fearing the dead weight of scholarship, he does not cite those whose findings he uses and disputes (Rajan? Bowra? Woodhouse?). Both books will happily induce interesting ques- tions about the situation of Milton's first parents. And Summers need not be alarmed: only one commentator makes anything of genre or structure this year-Hardison, in an interesting account of the poem as "admonitory epic" (see esp. 89). In periodical essays, T. B. Stroup (TSL, 6) relates the first and last appearances of Adam and Eve and Satan; I. Samuel (MP, 59) finds organic poetic unity through the "diminisht" stars; H. F. Robins (FIF) shows in detail how the integrated cosmological system and Hebraic tradition give consistent symbolic significance to the direction of movement, Satanic especially, centered on God but focussing on the human drama; C. Huckabay (in McNeir's volume) reviews nineteenth-century Satanism, and B. T. Sankey, Jr., Coleridge's association of Satan, Nimrod, Napoleon, and its philosophical basis; of Empson's Milton's God it need be observed here only that it is mistitled- better Empson's God, and better still Empson's Satan's God; B. Moritz-Siebeck (Anglia, 79) investigates at length the cos- mological situation, literary associations, and function of the Paradise of Fools; R. C. Fox (RES, 13) finds Mammon a dynamic figure of developing avarice; F. Manly (MLN, 76) analyzes the irony of the motion urged by Moloch, and later the significance of the animals named in VII; C. A. Patrides edits (ELH, 29) an analysis by the late C. M. Coffin of Creation and Adam's self-awareness in relation to God and Eve which makes one much regret the incompleteness of his other studies; A. Gilbert (FIF) discusses the instrumental function of 148</page><page sequence="31">ARTHUR E. BARKER several aspects of the theology of the poem; A. O. Lovejoy (for Mazzeo's Nicolson) brings the weight of the great chain of being to bear on the dialogue of astronomy and Raphael; D. C. Alien (FIF) expands his suggestion, followed by Cope, as to the significance of light-darkness imagery in Biblical, Neoplatonist, Orphic terms, and (MLN, 76) suggests analogues for the love of the angels; E. M. W. Tillyard (FIF) outlines interpretative annotation for IX and X; J. M. Steadman (SP, 59) examines Protestant commentary on the serpent's doom, and a much wider range of commentary on the giants of XI as the key to a Christian (not merely Christian-classical) antithesis as to heroism; M. Allentuck and K. Svendsen discuss (SEL, 2) the latter's earlier comments on Fuseli's "Dismission from Paradise"; M. Y. Hughes (FlF) makes a number of reproduced illustrations of the expulsion the occasion for reconsidering various recent responses to the misfortune or fortune of the Fall, Eve's responsibility, and the poem's concluding lines; Anne Davidson Ferry (for Mazzeo's Nicolson) argues that it is the epic poet's voice, as a character blindly involved, with the reader, in the situation, not the ethic, theology, or drama, that induces the sense of paradox. Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes received no major treatment this year; but periodical comment accumulates. P. R. Steadman adds to his accumulation the argument (UTQ, 31) that the former represents knowledge perfected by a series of rejections in an ordeal resembling Adam's, Paris's, Hercules's, and having a long moralist tradition behind it, and an account of the tempest as an appropriately-placed adversity symbol, and a review of felicity and beatitude as ends of man in Renaissance ethics and poetry, from Tasso, through Spenser, to Milton's epics-and thus leaves us with the hope that all these matters will soon be bound up together and specifically related. As to Samson, he develops (FIF) the parallels between Harapha and Goliath, Samson and David, with documentation from com- mentaries; while L. S. Cox (MLN, 76) finds sources and parallels for the "ev'ning Dragon"; M. A. N. Radzinowicz (Nicolson) examines the parallel and contrast between Eve and Dalila as to hardening of the heart; J. B. Broadbent (with Barron's Comus) provides stimulating notes on the verse and on biblical echoes but obscures the theme through accepting the choral comment at a disliked religious face-value; G. Finney 149</page><page sequence="32">150 RECENT STUDIES reprints her essay on the background of the chorus in musical drama; W. R. Parker (FIF) presents detailed notes on textual problems and comments on the question of Milton's spelling; E. Sirluck (FIF; see above) appends to Milton's idle right hand a refutation of Parker's and Gilbert's (though not others') arguments for earlier dating; without reference to any com- mentator later than Krouse, J. D. Ebbs associates poetic justice with the workings of providence; P. R. Sellin (FIF) brings this list to an appropriate and spent conclusion by very precisely and learnedly (though strictly in humanist ethical terms, not in terms of religious experience) discriminating from Italian views and relating to those of Heinsius Milton's theory of catharsis.
