NORTHEAST A lull in research activities along the eastern seaboard at the time of this submission can be accounted for by the fact that most spring activity is directed toward sum- mer plans rather than past accomplishment. However, some continuing and accomplished research is noted by correspondents. NEW YORK. Marion White (University of Buffalo) has been continuing his study of settlement-pattern changes related to the introduction of agriculture in western New York and Ontario. A National Science Foundation grant is making possible laboratory analyses of refuse bones recovered during the past two summers from the Martin site, a terminal Middle Woodland location on Grand Island, and the Henry Long site, an intermediate-period Iroquois component of the Late Woodland (about A.D. 1300). Charles F. Hayes, III (Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences) continues research on Prehistoric Iroquois in central and western New York, following an indication of wider cultural affiliations in the Bristol Hills area of central New York. Joining in this work are Daniel M. Barber (Rochester Museum) and co-operating members of the New York State Archaeological Association. Frank Schambach (Harvard graduate student), assist- ant to William Ritchie (New York State Museum), is undertaking for the National Park Service an archaeo- logical survey of the Davenport Center, Genegantslet, South Plymouth, West Oneonta, and Copes Corner reservoirs on the upper branches of the Susquehanna. A systematic survey is expected to provide a site inventory and evaluation complementing the considerable research so far accomplished on the main portion of the Susque- hanna south of New York. PENNSYLVANIA. River basin and historic site investiga- tions characterize archaeological work in this state. Na- tional Park Service contracts are in force for surveys of Aylesworth and Fall Brook reservoirs by Temple Univer- sity, represented by Jacob Gruber; Temple field units are salvaging Archaic and Woodland sites in Maiden Creek, Cowanesque, Blue March, and Blanchard reservoirs, all in eastern Pennsylvania. Fred Kinsey (Franklin and Mar- shall College) is identifying sites on the Pennsylvania side of of Tocks Island Reservoir on the Delaware River. On the Cumberland River, Corps of Engineers project surveys are being conducted by Don Dragoo (Carnegie Museum), who is also making surveys on three small reservoirs on the Monongahela River in northwestern Pennsylvania. John Witthoft, assisted by Catherine Mc- Cann, is placing research in abeyance to devote full time to preparing archaeological exhibit and research materials for the move to the new State Museum Building (Harris- burg), which will open on October 24, 1964. J. Duncan Campbell has turned his attention to French and Indian War sites in Pennsylvania and has investigated traces of 237</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY the Braddock Road and evidence of the French and Indian positions at Fort Necessity for the National Park Service. At Fort Hunter, north of Harrisburg, Col. Camp- bell and Robert Fitchburn have located a fortfied grain mill of the French and Indian War period for the Fort Hunter Association. At the Overpeck site near Kintners. ville, the Forks of the Delaware Chapter of the Archaeo- logical Society of Pennsylvania, assisted by John Witthoft, has identified three levels: an upper level containing European trade goods of 1550 and Susquehannock pottery, a middle Lenape level that dates around 1450, and a lower level with Vinette I pottery of the Early Woodland horizon. Vernon Leslie is continuing his archaeologi.cal research in the upper Delaware Valley. He has completed a pro- jectile-point typology for Wayne County, Pennsylvania, and Sullivan County, New York, and a study of the upper Delaware Valley Archaic sites. He is also working on the petrology of chipped-stone artifacts from the Milford area. This is an outgrowth of his report on the transition from Paleo-Indian to Archaic manifestations in the upper Delaware Valley. Members of the Lenape Chapter of the Society for Pennsylvania Archaeology, under the direction of David Werner, Port Jervis, New York, continued work at the Zimmerman site on the Delaware in Pike County, Penn- sylvania. Werner was assisted by Lyman Vandermark, also of Port Jervis, in further testing of a New Jersey site described by Leslie as the first Paleo-Indian site to be excavated in the upper Delaware Basin. The Department of Sociology and Anthropology of Franklin and Marshall College has received a grant from the National Science Foundation Undergraduate Science Education Program to investigate problems relating to a Late Woodland village site on the lower Susquehanna River. The work is under the direction of Charles H. Holzinger. NEW JERSEY. The Tocks Island archaeological survey for the National Park Service, directed by Dorothy Cross (State Museum at Trenton) and under the field leader- ship of Willard Sloshberg, has continued the use of mechanized equipment to explore deeply buried Archaic evidence in the sands of the Delaware River alluvium at the Pahaquarra site. The final report of the 1964 season at this site is expected to produce a demonstration of the value of deep testing by machine in thick, sandy, alluvial deposits characterized by scattered artifact inclusions without associated occupational features. CONNECTICUT. Bernard W. Powell and Ted Jostrand completed work on the Sasqua Hill site, a multicom- ponent settlement on the coast near East Norwalk which contains an early component of the Clasons Point focus. Douglas F. Jordan (University of Connecticut) con- ducted surveys for the National Park Service at Mad River, Colebrook River, Sucker Brook, Hop Brook, and Black Rock reservoirs. Bert Salwen (Bennington College) surveyed Victory, Gaysville, and the Island reservoirs for archaeological sites and salvage requirements. MASSACHUSETTS. Douglas F. Jordan surveyed the ar- chaeological sites of Conant Brook, a Corps of Engineers reservoir project. NEW HAMPSHIRE. Bert Salwen made surveys of the Waterbury, Rutland, and Roaring Branch Local Protec- tion projects, as well as the Claremont Reservoir, through the cooperation of the National Park Service in Corps of Engineers areas. ONTARIO. Kenneth E. Kidd is surveying field prospects in the rich area around Peterborough. NEW BRUNSWICK. Norman F. Barka (Harvard Uni- versity) is preparing a report on the excavation of Fort La Tour (1631-45) and La Coupe Drydock, a 17th-century site thought to be the first of its kind studied archaeo- logically in Canada. NOVA SCOTIA. Edward McM. Larrabee (Fortress of Louisbourg Restoration Program) has completed the excavation of the King's Bastion and is proceeding with studies that will make available the necessary compara- tive data required to restore this and other features of the Fort, now in the third year of active archaeological exploration. GENERAL. Bibliographical data sheets designed as a critical review of references published on historical sites are being assembled by John L. Cotter through the co- operation of colleagues in this field in accordance with agreements reached at the 1962 Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology. As the bibliography grows, an effort will be made to make items available to archaeologists active in historical sites research. A project of graduate students in American Civilization at the University of Pennsylvania is continuing into its second year the compilation of a handbook of key artifacts of the Colonial and early Federal periods of North America. The project is being developed in a course on historical sites archaeology given by Cotter. JOHN L. COTTER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ILLINOIS. Stuart Struever (University of Chicago) reports that during the 1962 and 1963 seasons at the Apple Creek site combined water-separation and chemi- cal-flotation processes were utilized to recover macro-plant remains from matrices that had already been processed through standard table screens. It was found that 90% or more of the recoverable carbonized nut shells, seeds, and stem fragments had slipped through the screen. In addition, very large quantities of fish remains were recovered in the flotation process; these outnumber by many times those recovered on the screens. Andreas A. Paloumpis (Illinois State University) has already identi- fied, in most cases down to genus and often to species level, in excess of 12,000 fish bones. This represents but a fraction of the total fish bone recovered. In addition, the flotation process yielded a profusion of secondary flint chips that had evaded the screens, providing a more 238 [ VOL. 30, No. 2, 1964</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH accurate picture of their distribution and relative fre- quency at the site. Tiny fragments of sheet mica were also recovered by flotation, from which it appears that the resident Havana-Hopewellian and Pike-Hopewellian groups had used this raw material, normally thought of as a Hopewellian mortuary item, in their living sites. The Apple Creek site was the scene of three major occupations. The earliest, the Havana-Hopewellian phase, Struever dates from about 100 B.C. to A.D. 50. This phase was followed by important stylistic changes in ceramics indicated in the recent recognition of the Pike series. The Pike-Hopewellian phase, which may have terminated about A.D. 350, was succeeded by the White Hall phase. White Hall is characterized by important ceramic and projectile-point changes and is believed to date about A.D. 650. The Apple Creek pottery series, diagnostic of White Hall, reveals a continuation of some Hopewell and Havana decorative and morphological concepts, but it exhibits sufficient differences to warrant its being set apart as a separate series. The Middle and Late Woodland subsistence patterns that can be reconstructed from the screened plant and animal remains differ sharply from the patterns that are revealed through use of the flotation technique. Were it not for flotation extraction, the relative importance of various natural-food resources to different Apple Creek groups would not have become apparent. Flotation sampling is revealing the great importance of acorns, hickory nuts, and fish in Apple Creek subsistence. Flo- tation extraction should become a standard field tech- nique, otherwise apparent differences in subsistence patterns between two prehistoric cultures might simply reflect the fact that intensive flotation sampling was undertaken in the sites of one and not the other. An archaeological survey of the new 2600-acre site of the Edwardsville campus of Southern Illinois University is being conducted by T. Patrick Culbert. If construction activities threaten any sites on the campus, salvage opera- tions will be undertaken. Survey of about one-half the campus has now been completed, and six prehistoric sites have been found. Two sites in or very near bottom land are related to late developments in the American Bottoms. The remaining four sites are along minor streams at some distance from bottom land. Three seem to be Archaic campsites, but the fourth is of undetermined affiliation. No sites on the campus include mounds or other visible features of construction. The Southern Illinois University Museum is continuing its active highway-salvage program along FAI 57 in south- ern Illinois under the supervision of F. Jerome Melbye. The excavation program for the summer of 1964 includes a late Early Woodland site about 5 mi. south of Mount Vernon. Further preliminary site examination is planned for several sites north of Cairo, Illinois. These range in type from Archaic to Mississippian. Laboratory analysis of past highway-salvage excavations has been progressing through the years, and several preliminary reports have been produced. The most significant result of last year's excavations was the demonstration of purposeful burial orientation toward ceremonial centers during Middle Mississippian times. This is the result of excavations at the Kane burial mounds on the bluffs overlooking the American Bottoms. Jon H. Winston (University of Illinois) is completing a report on excavations in the Sny Basin of western Illinois. William Gardner is preparing a report on his excavations at sites along the Kaskaskia River in the Shelbyville Reservoir. Joseph Vogel (Illinois State Museum) has completed a report on his analysis of Woodland and Mississippian pottery from two occupational areas excavated by the Museum within the Cahokia mound group in Madison County in 1960 and 1961. Combined with this are sup- plementary observations on pottery excavated at smaller outlying settlements north of Collinsville in 1963. In brief, the results provide a quantitative basis for evalu- ating the trends and relationships of pottery developments observed by earlier workers in the Cahokia area, but they also go beyond the 1960 level of knowledge of Cahokia ceramics to provide a new body of information on which to base the interpretation of Mississippian development in the northern Mississippi Valley. Near the Cahokia mound center, the central area of the American Bottoms archaeological locality, the prin- cipal late occupations are Middle Mississippi and Late Woodland in general configuration. The Late Woodland complex is that which in field parlance has been referred to as "Bluff" because of the resemblance of its pottery to that from bluff settlements and mounds in the greater East St. Louis area, particularly Titterington's "Jersey Bluff" materials. Within the local expression of the Bluff Woodland tradition, Vogel recognizes a ceramic distinc- tion between an earlier Loyd phase and a later Merrell phase. Loyd phase pottery is characterized by hemispherical bowls with all-over cordmarking and jars similarly fin- ished but frequently with smoothed areas above the shoulders. Pastes were sometimes tempered with crushed crystalline rock ("grit") but more often with crushed sherds ("grog"). The sherds from which the grog was prepared had frequently come from pots that were ori- ginalliy grit-tempered. During the subsequent Merrell phase, crushed lime- stone comes into use as temper and grit diminishes in popularity, but grog remains the characteristic temper type. Smoothing of jars may extend over the entire body, and bowls are characteristically smoothed all over. Red filming appears, and the lip areas of jars are frequently manipulated by notching, by extrusion, and by a variety of filleting. Bowl rims become more incurving. The name Monks Mound Red has previously been applied to one combination of Merrell phase ceramic modes, that is, smooth, red-filmed, limestone-tempered bowls. This bowl type survives other Merrell phase types and is well-known in the Early Mississippian ceramic complex at Cahokia ("Old Village") and at Aztalan in Wisconsin. The great similarity of two smoothed Merrell phase jar types to one variety of the well-known early Mississip- 239</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY pian type Powell Plain suggests strongly that Powell Plain has its roots in the local Bluff Woodland ceramic tradi- tion. The shift is accomplished by a simple substitution of shell for limestone or grog as the tempering medium. The two varieties of Powell Plain which Vogel recognizes differ in the degree of surface smoothing and the amount of "rolling" of the lip. Moderately smoothed jars with a slight edging or extrusion of the outer lip are difficult to treat as anything but shell-tempered variants of particular Merrell phase, that is, local Late Woodland types. The second Powell variety is more carefully smoothed, often polished, and has a fuller, more rolled lip. It is this variety of Powell Plain which the decorated Early Mis- sissippian type Ramey Incised resembles most in form and finish. No trailed or incised types are native to the Bluff ceramic tradition. The general character of the full-blown Mississippian ceramic complex at Cahokia is widely known, but Vogel is able to give statistical evidence relating trends toward increasing domestic house size, jar rim heights, and plate rim widths; diminishing use of red-filming and polishing of vessel surfaces; and decreasing width of trailing on plate rims. These trends are cross-correlated and pegged to radiocarbon chronology. With the shift of Monks Mound Red (limestone-tempered) to Cahokia Red Filmed (shell-tempered) midway in the Mississippian period, the last Woodland type has been submerged within the Mis- sissippian complex. This analysis is the product of a co-operative investigation by institutional members of the Illinois Archaeological Survey into the climax develop- ment of Mississippian culture in the greater East St. Louis area. The research has been sponsored largely by a three- year grant from the National Science Foundation and is based upon field work in great part performed with sup- port from the Federal Aid Highway Program in co- operation with the Illinois Division of Highways. Though National Science Foundation support for the current project terminates June 30, 1964, the momentum of the program will be slackened but not lost. In the St. Louis area an effort was begun in early 1964, under the leadership of Nelson Reed, to attract new money to the Cahokia program. Enough was assured by May, 1964, largely from private sources, to permit the excavation of two acres that comprise the 97- and 100-foot terraces of Monks Mound, an investigation which will be supervised by the Illinois Archaeological Survey under the field direction of James Porter (Southern Illinois University) and Charles Bareis (University of Illinois). One objective is to obtain information which will permit the recon- struction of aboriginal structures on the mound summit. Related to this is an air-photo and topographic survey of Cahokia Mounds State Park, which began in the spring of 1964 under the direction of Melvin Fowler (Southern Illinois University), with special emphasis on a system of causeways which may once have linked areas within the Cahokia group proper and which may have extended toward contemporary neighboring mound centers, such as the Emerald group, where new excavations are planned by the Illinois State Museum in 1964. The grand scale of construction of visible earthworks (85 numbered mounds, mostly platforms, within the central Cahokia group), the monumental character of perishable community-related surface structures discovered at Cahokia by Warren Wittry (Cranbrook Institute of Science), the insights into ceramic production and trade coming from petrographic thin-section analyses of Cahokia area pottery by James Porter, the clearing picture of the place of local Late Woodland and downriver contribu- tions to the development of Mississippian culture, and the implications of much other related research is pro- ducing a fresh image of an important and long-known archaeological locality at a time when the near-complete destruction of the key sites by urban expansion within the present generation is a tragically real prospect. MISSOURI. Carl H. Chapman (University of Mis- souri) continued his work at Osage Indian sites in Vernon County in the summer of 1963. The excavations at Sites 23VE1, 23VE3, and 23VE4 were supported by the Na- tional Science Foundation. Other Osage sites in the Kaysinger Reservoir were investigated with National Park Service funds. Chapman also worked briefly at Site 23VE2, a known Osage Indian village and probable location of the Spanish Fort Carondelet (1795-1801). Another field party in the Kaysinger Reservoir, directed by Sidney Denny and Edward Sudderth, excavated sev- eral mound, camp, and shelter sites. One of these, Rogers Shelter, contains deep and stratified deposits that should aid appreciably in determining the cultural se- quence in Kaysinger. Later in the summer, Denny and Sudderth conducted an archaeological reconnaissance of Wind Cave National Monument in South Dakota for the National Park Service. W. Raymond Wood (University of Missouri) directed the excavation of a number of sites in both the Kaysinger and Stockton reservoirs. He was assisted by Rolland E. Pangborn, the work being supported by the National Park Service. Four mounds of the Late Woodland Fris- toe Burial Complex were dug in Kaysinger, and six mounds and four shelter sites were dug in Stockton. The burial mounds in the latter reservoir date from late Archaic through Mississippian, but they have not yet been ascribed to named complexes. Richard A. Marshall has been engaged in numerous salvage operations in several parts of the state: survey along the right-of-way of the proposed Interstate Highway 55 in southeast Missouri; work at the Marret site, in Dunklin County, where two superimposed Mississippian houses were unearthed; continuation of emergency salvage at the late Archaic or Woodland Axeton Ossuary, north- west of Macon, Missouri; excavation of 25 burials in a Mississippian cemetery at the Spanish Grant site; inves- tigation of a stone-box-grave cemetery near St. Louis; and initial work on a large mound near Booneville that ap- parently contains a central log-lined chamber. In October, most of the staff participated in the inves- tigation of a mastodon that was unearthed in a gravel pit near Craig, Missouri. This mastodon appears to have been dismembered, and some distance away there was a 240 [ VOL. 30, No. 2, 1964</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH fireplace at the same depth as the mastodon bones. Un- fortunately, nothing was found with the mastodon itself to demonstrate its contemporaneity with man. During the past summer Robert T. Bray and Richard A. Marshall jointly conducted the University of Missouri field school at the Utz site, during which time they un- earthed three oval house sites. Bray, working for the State Park Board, carried out excavations at the Caleb Bingham House at Arrow Rock State Park and investi- gated other historic sites for the State Park Board. R. Bruce McMillan has been engaged in an inventory survey of two reservoirs in the Meramac Basin, con- sisting of reconnaissance and limited test excavations; and Rolland E. Pangborn is continuing the reconnaissance of the Stockton, Kaysinger Bluff, and Hackleman Corner reservoirs. From St. Louis, Leonard Blake reports that during the summer of 1963 the grading machinery of a subdivision developer uncovered a group of Indian graves in Jefferson County just south of St. Louis. An unknown observer appealed to the county attorney to halt the destruction. The prosecutor did so by sending the county sheriff to stop the bulldozers, using as his authority a Missouri statute which makes it a felony to "willfully or maliciously damage a cemetery grave or burial." This action, which received widespread radio and newspaper publicity, pro- vided enough time for a crew headed by Harold M. Ross to come from the University of Missouri field school and to excavate a dozen graves. The salvage operation was aided by local amateurs with field training. Vladimir Markotic (Illinois State University) has con- ducted test excavations in Gourd Creek Cave near Rolla, Missouri. The latest investigation, March 21-28, 1964, was supervised jointly by Markotic and Bruce McMillan of the University of Missouri. The occupations repre- sented in the cave range from middle Archaic to Late Woodland. The material is now being processed and evaluated in Normal. WISCONSIN. The University of Wisconsin will continue a co-operative venture undertaken by the Center for Climatic Research of the Department of Meteorology and the Department of Anthropology, under the direction of Reid A. Bryson and David A. Baerreis. During the sum- mer of 1963, five Mill Creek components in northwestern Iowa were tested by Dale Henning in an effort to obtain sufficient data for determining the extent to which cul- ture change might be related to climatic factors. These data have been subjected to cultural, faunal, palyno- logical, molluscan, botanical, and pedological analyses correlated by radiocarbon dating. A new project supported by the National Science Foundation will concentrate upon climatic factors and their relationship to the later Oneota occupations in the Midwest. Sites in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri that offer a wide range in prehistoric and protohistoric ecological adaptation will be tested by Hen- ning and Richard Peske. ROBERT L. HALL SOUTHEAST Field work started early in the spring in Florida, and a highway-salvage project in southeastern Tennessee made it necessary to put a crew in the field in January, 1964. Otherwise the winter and spring period was spent in laboratory research. Archaeologists in Alabama and Louisiana are concentrating on the Paleo-Indian problem. The 21st Southeastern Archaeological Conference will be held in late October at New Orleans. Tulane Uni- versity will be host, and the main topic will be the ori- gin, spread, and diffusion of agriculture in the Southeast. A salvage committee has been appointed by the Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida. This committee will advise the director of the fund on salvage laws and permits to work on historic sites under offshore waters of Florida. The duties of this committee will also include protection of known sunken galleons and drafting an antiquities act to protect estab- lished historic sites. The committee is especially inter- ested in curbing the activities of scuba divers who are looting areas of known historic value. The office of the Attorney General of Florida and existing law-enforcement agencies are cooperating with this newly formed committee. ALABAMA. The University of Alabama conducted sur- veys and tests during the spring in preparation for sum- mer projects. Laboratory work concentrated on the Paleo- Indian in the Tennessee Valley and on the establishment of a point-type chronology for the area. ARKANSAS. Under a National Science Foundation grant, surface collections were made by the University of Arkansas Museum from a series of large village and mound sites in eastern Arkansas. The type percentages from these and similar collections will be compared with the percentages of types found in graves at the same sites which are now in the Museum's collections. An emergency salvage project of three days was conducted near Norfolk Dam by the Museum and members of the Twin Lakes Chapter of the Arkansas Archaeological Society. Extended and flexed burials were recovered from a cemetery, and plain shell-tempered, flat-bottomed pot- tery, shell beads, and a pendant were found in association. A highway-salvage program will be established in Arkan- sas in the summer of 1964. GEORGIA. Earl Ingmanson (National Park Service) has continued work summarizing the 1930 WPA excavations at Ocmulgee National Monument. In addition, he sur- veyed the Tobesofkee Creek Reservoir (a Soil Conserva- tion Service project) but found only two small sites. The University of Georgia, in cooperation with the National Park Service, will conduct a survey of Carters Reservoir. KENTUCKY. Lee Hanson (University of Kentucky Mu- seum) located 33 sites in the course of a survey during November and December, 1963, in the proposed Green River Reservoir. No pottery was found, but chipped-stone artifacts indicate Archaic through Mississippian occupa- tions. The sites may represent upstream hunting camps of people with villages on the lower Green or Cumber- land rivers. 241</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Three radiocarbon dates have been provided for the Mississippian mound excavated in the summer of 1963 in Barren County by the University of Kentucky: A.D. 1015 ? 120 years; A.D. 1280 ? 100 years; and A.D. 1410 ? 120 years. Pottery from the associated village, although shell-tempered, often is cord-marked and check-stamped, perhaps an indication of its relative isolation from Mis- sissippian sites to the west. The site seems to have ties with eastern Tennessee rather than with western Ken- tucky. A radiocarbon date of A.D. 1417 - 175 years has been obtained for the small stockaded Fort Ancient vil- lage excavated in 1963. The pottery conforms generally to the established Fort Ancient types; one new Woodland type was found, Levissa Check Stamped, which is similar to Johnson Plain except for surface treatment. Research is also being carried out at the University of Kentucky Museum on the material originally excavated by WPA labor at the Biggs Mound, in the Portsmouth earthworks groups in northern Kentucky. FLORIDA. Ripley P. Bullen (Florida State Museum) conducted excavations at the Crystal River site, supple- menting his work there in 1960. This site is now a Florida State Park, and Bullen's excavations were designed to provide additional data and artifacts for an exhibit mu- seum. Charcoal samples for dating were obtained from the midden and from the main burial mound. Excavation of undisturbed burials in the circular embankment sur- rounding the main burial mound uncovered a large pottery deposit. With the lowest burials were plummets and perforated shells. William Sears (Florida State Museum) continued work at Fort Center on the shores of Lake Okeechobee. The site is probably a key to the prehistory of the southern Florida Glades area. Earthworks (including small mounds, a large mound, and ramps) are reminiscent of Hopewell earthworks. A charnel house has produced preserved wooden objects, and the pottery, mostly of a plain variety, does not change during some 1500 years of occupation (A.D. 1 to 1500). Graduate students at the University of Florida have been active in research during the winter. Two masters' theses have been completed, one on an Archaic site (A-356) (Clausen) and one on excavations at Antigua, West Indies (Hoffman). Long is analyzing material from Panama Vieja, and Crawford is making a survey of the coastal plain of North Carolina. In addition, a survey has been made at the Horseshoe Beach site in Dixie County. This is an important Pasco site with multiple sand mounds and limestone-tempered pottery. John Griffin (National Park Service) initiated a full- scale survey of Everglades National Park in January, 1964. More than 55 sites have been recorded, some ranging up to 20 acres in size. NORTH CAROLINA. Stanley South (State Department of Archives and History) made initial excavations in the spring of 1964 at the 18th-century Moravian town of Bethabara near Winston-Salem. Of particular interest was the excavation of an extensive waste dump from the kiln of Gottfried Aust, who made pottery at Bethabara from 1755 co 1772. Pipes of an anthropomorphic type are of particular interest. Plans are being made for the exca- vation of the entire town. The work is being sponsored by the Moravian church through a grant made to them by the Charles Babcock Foundation of Winston-Salem. The North Carolina Department of Archives and History and Old Salem, Inc., are cooperating in the project. VIRGINIA. C. H. Holland (University of Virginia) is continuing work on materials collected from 40 sites dur- ing the survey of coastal Virginia. Corn from south- western Virginia dates at approximately A.D. 1000 or somewhat later. Two carbon samples have been sub- mitted for dating the top and bottom of the ceramic sequence in that part of the state. Excavation and analy- sis was completed on the Octonia rockshelter in Green County, and work continues on the Elvin Graves rock- shelter, a stratified site (Archaic-Woodland) in Madison County. Holland reports that the pottery distribution for proto- historic sites has been worked out for the coastal plain in Virginia. This study has resulted in a revision of Evans' findings. Chickahominy Fabric Impressed, formerly placed in Late Woodland, more properly belongs in Middle Woodland. The Archaic of the coastal plain shows remarkable similarities to the "quartzite-using" horizon in the Shenandoah Valley, and the two widely separated areas on this time level may be expressions of the same cultural horizon. A study of the Octonia rockshelter by the University of Virginia has shown that seasonal treks were made across the Blue Ridge Mountains into the Piedmont to establish hunting camps. This represents an archaeo- logical demonstration in an unknown group of a practice which has been documented historically for the Algon- kian-speaking groups of the coastal plains in Virginia. Carl Miller (Bureau of American Ethnology) con- ducted salvage excavations, in cooperation with the Appalachian Power Company, in the Smith Mountain Reservoir in the Roanoke drainage of Virginia. Two large village sites were tested. Among traits of particular interest are bone flutes and slab metates. Most of the pottery types established for the Kerr Reservoir early phase occur also in the Smith Mountain Reservoir. More- over, some sort of stockade appears to have surrounded one of the villages, an inference based on a line of small rock piles that was found along the southern margin of the occupation area. MISSIssIPPI. C. F. Bohannon (National Park Service) carried out excavations at the Mangum site in Claiborne County and recovered 24 burials (bundle, extended primary, multiple, and single). A copper plate with cult design was found in association with a Plaquemine occu- pation. Cotter had previously excavated a similar copper plate at this site. Excavations are beginning at the Boyd mounds in Madison County. Thomas H. Koehler (University of Mississippi), with the aid of students, tested a village site near Batesville. The results were inconclusive because the site was shal- 242 [ VOL. 30, No. 2, 1964</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH low. The Koehlers have been instrumental in the organ- ization of the Mississippi Archaeological Association. Robert S. Neitzel (State Department of ArchIves and History) has been cataloging and preserving artifacts salvaged from the sunken Federal gunboat Cairo. High water temporarily stopped salvage operations. LOUISIANA. Sherwood Gagliano (Coastal Studies Insti- tute), Hiram Gregory (Northwestern State College), and Clarence Webb (Shreveport) are coopcrating on a study of the Paleo-Indian in Louisiana. Thus far over 200 projectile points from private and museum collections have been examined and classified. Clovis, Scottsbluff, a local Clovis "relative," San Patrice, and Kirk points have been recognized. Gagliano has also been working on the problem of the distribution of Moundville-related and Southern Cult shell-tempered pottery along the Gulf coast of Louisiana and Mississippi. Gregory is classifying some 5000 points in the Williamsen Museum at North- western State College. Studies of historic-site collections are revealing the range of ceramic and tool types in use at the beginning of the 1800's. Webb and McKinney are continuing their excavations at Mounds Plantation, a large early Caddoan site in northwestern Louisiana. W. G. Haag (Louisiana State University) has estab- lished a central file for archaeological information in Louisiana, and students from Louisiana State University and Northwestern State College are aiding in a state site survey. TENNESSEE. The University of Tennessee conducted excavations at Moccasin Bend near Chattanooga as part of their highway-salvage program. J. B. Graham was in charge of this work. Evidences of Early and Middle Woodland occupations were found, as well as the floor of a Mississippian house. Continuing analysis of materials recovered during excavations in the Cordell Hull Reser- voir is producing evidence of Paleo Indian and Archaic occupations. HESTER A. DAVIS PLAINS The following notes summarize research conducted in the Plains area of North America during the latter part of 1963 and the early spring of 1964. MONTANA. The Billings Archaeological Society has been duplicating rock art on matte-finish acetate film. This technique has proved to be particularly valuable for recording outlines too dim for effective photography. Nearly 100 figures and panels from 20 sites have been reproduced. At Site 24PH402 (Phillips County, north- central Montana) the Milk River and Billings archaeo- logical societies cooperated in recording pictographs and obtaining a surface collection from this cave occupation. About 25 yellow, red, and black pictographs were repro- duced. Surface finds include broken arrowshafts, a trimmed feather, a wooden whistle, one stone knife, and a stone pendant. The Billings Archaeological Society is also salvaging material from a vandalized site in Sweet Grass County, southwestern Montana. Site 24SG402 has a buried cultural deposit containing pottery attributed to the Mandan-Hidatsa tradition. The Gallatin County Archaeological Society, under the sponsorship of Montana State College, is continuing its survey of sites in southwestern Montana and also the cataloging of individual collections. The basement of the McGill Museum has been converted into a laboratory to facilitate this work. The city of Billings has set up a commission to develop the sites of Pictograph and Ghost caves as a city park. The current drive is headed by Mayor Willard E. Fraser, a former student of Earl Morris. WYOMING. From October 22 through November 4, 1963, Wilfred M. Husted of the Smithsonian Institution, in cooperation with the National Park Service, conducted exploratory tests in areas to be expanded for visitor facili- ties at Fort Laramie National Park. In one area the walls of a building, 20 by 24 ft., were exposed. Slag, wagon parts, oxshoes, horseshoes, and farrier's implements sug- gest that the original structure was a blacksmith shop. Another structure, not so clearly outlined, was character- ized by a fireplace foundation and several small, circular structures of rock set in lime plaster. A refuse pit nearby contained glass, broken dishes, metal, textiles, leather shoes, and a gold dollar dated 1850. The structures are presumed to be part of the Ward and Guerrier Trading Post. In another test area, Husted exposed an aboriginal firepit measuring about 3.5 ft. in diameter and .5 ft. in depth. Although fill from the pit contained fire-cracked cobbles, diagnostic artifacts were absent. NORTH DAKOTA. Donald J. Lehmer of Dana College, Blair, Nebraska, spent several days with Paul Ewald of the State Historical Society of North Dakota, visiting a num- ber of sites near Bismarck. He selected one for excava- tion in the summer of 1964. Lehmer will head a party for the Society, in cooperation with the National Park Service, to excavate the Fire Heart site (32SI2) about 10 mi. down the Missouri River from Fort Yates. SOUTH DAKOTA. During the first week of April, Oscar L. Mallory and Richard E. Jensen of the Smithsonian Institution conducted a reconnaissance of sites selected for the 1964 field season in the Big Bend Reservoir area. The unusually high pool-level of the Reservoir has en- dangered all sites on the excavation list. They found most sites along the right bank still slightly above the water, but in danger of slumping and wave action. Along the left bank, numerous sites were submerged or remain only as islands. NEBRASKA. John W. Garrett (Nebraska State Highway Salvage) excavated Site 25DS21, a late prehistoric, multi- component occupation area in Dawson County, south- central Nebraska. Robert W. Neuman (Smithsonian Institution) cooperated with the Nebraska Game, For- estation, and Park Commission in a one-day reconnais- sance in the Little Nemaha River drainage of south- eastern Nebraska. Artifacts were collected from sand and cobble bars, but no actual occupation areas were 243</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY observed. Artifacts found include specimens diagnostic of the Early Lithic and Plains Woodland horizons. KANSAS. In October, 1963, the Kansas State Historical Society, in cooperation with the National Park Service, investigated a site on a small island in the Kerwin Reservoir, Phillips County, Kansas. Human skeletal re- mains representing two individuals, along with pottery and stone artifacts, suggest that the site belongs to the Keith focus. The Society also conducted an archaeo- logical survey of the Perry Reservoir in northeastern Kansas. Thirty-five new sites were recorded. Most of these pertain to Early Man and the Middle Ceramic period, although a few Hopewellian manifestations were also represented. The Kansas State Historical Society also published the second number of its Anthropological Series. COLORADO. In August, 1963, the University of Colorado participated in three small salvage excavations in north- eastern Colorado. David A. Breternitz of the Department of Anthropology was in charge. The first project con- sisted of the excavation of a human burial located 7 ft. below the surface along a tributary of Gordon Creek in Roosevelt National Forest. The interment was primary in a straight-sided pit, and the body was flexed and coated with hematite. Associated artifacts included a large, bifacially chipped knife, perforated wapiti teeth, a celt, and some undiagnostic flaked implements. No com- parable material is known from the area. The second project encompassed partial excavations at the Michaud site, a Late Woodland occupation, in the Bijou Basin near Strasburg, Colorado. Here a group of graduate stu- dents worked in the habitation and burial areas of the site. The third project consisted of work south of Mor- rison, Colorado, at the Willowbrook Estates residential development where landowners and developers permitted investigation prior to construction. Several small rock- shelters were tested, but the main efforts were directed toward a site designated as Willowbrook 1. Cultural ma- terial here was found down to a maximum depth of 7 ft. Two cultural levels, tentatively identified as Late Wood- land overlying an Archaic horizon, have been exposed. OKLAHOMA. Since September, 1963, the Oklahoma River Basin Survey Project has been working on analyses, research, and final reports concerning sites in the Mark- ham Ferry Reservoir area, northeastern Oklahoma. The most recent report on this work, prepared by Don G. Wyckoff, has been published. The Project is also con- ducting archaeological surveys in three proposed reservoir areas, namely the Webbers Falls-Verdigris, Camp Creek Project Number 12, and the Arbuckle. Thomas Barr and Hank Kerr (Oklahoma River Basin Survey Project) spent a week near Moreland, Oklahoma, where road-grading activities had disturbed mammoth bones in a clay stratum 6 ft. below the present ground surface. Test excavations exposed partially disarticulated remains of one mammoth, but no artifacts were found. Robert E. Bell and James A. Brown (University of Oklahoma) are currently working on a joint project in Caddoan archaeology. Aided by funds from the National Science Foundation, Robert Bell is analyzing data from the Harlan site, Cherokee County, Oklahoma, and James Brown is conducting research on material from the Spiro mound group in LeFlore County. Marvin E. Tong, Jr. (Museum of the Great Plains), reports that the museum is making an extensive site survey of southwestern Oklahoma and that special atten- tion is being given to the area of the Wichita Mountains. T. M. Hamilton has begun the first phase of an extensive investigation of French influence in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. TEXAS. During late March and early April, field studies were made of rock paintings in the Amistad Reservoir region of western Texas. Seven rock-painting sites were found and completely recorded. Water-color drawings were made by Robert Thomas and Conway Pierson (Uni- versity of California, Santa Barbara). This study is being directed by David Gebhard, who is attempting to establish a chronology of art styles within the Amistad Reservoir. MEXICO. Between October 1 and December 15, 1963, Jeremiah F. Epstein (University of Texas) excavated a rockshelter near Linares, Nuevo Leon. The site, Cueva de la Zona, has a cultural deposit lying on what is believed to be terminal Pleistocene gravels. Over 1000 projectile points and point fragments were removed from a 15-foot square; bifaces and thinning flakes were also abundant. Preliminary analysis of Cueva de la Zona suggests a sequence similar to that obtained by Richard S. MacNeish in Tamaulipas. ROBERT W. NEUMAN NORTHWEST BRITISH COLUMBIA. With Provincial Government sup- port, the Archaeological Sites Advisory Board of British Columbia is sponsoring a series of exploratory projects in the summer of 1964. From June 15th to the end of July, Donald Mitchell (University of Oregon) will direct test excavations at Dionisio Point and Montague Harbour, two deep shell-midden sites on Galiano Island in the Strait of Georgia. In August, Mitchell will transfer his activities to the interior of the Province in order to complete the site survey of the Peace River portion of the area of the Portage Mountain Dam reservoir, a project which came to an abrupt halt in the preceding summer when the survey boat swamped in the treacherous Ne-Parle-Pas Rapids. Mitchell will round out a busy season with site surveys in the Chilcotin district. The Archaeological Sites Advisory Board has approved a recommendation by Wilson Duff, Chairman of the Board, that Ash Point, a large threatened archaeological site at the head of Pedder Bay on the southwestern tip of Vancouver Island, be acquired by the Provincial Gov- ernment for development as an archaeological park. In addition to deep and extensive cultural deposits, which are estimated to encompass a period of some 3000 years, the site features numerous burial cairns and remains of aboriginal fortifications. Donald Abbott of the Provincial 244 [ VOL. 30, No. 2, 1964</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH Museum staff will conduct test excavations at Ash Point from early August to the end of September, 1964. David Sanger will direct a major archaeological field project in the Lochnore-Nesikep Creek area of the Fraser River Valley between Lillooet and Lytton. The project is a cooperative venture in which the National Museum of Canada, the Archaeological Sites Advisory Board of British Columbia, and the University of Washington and the University of British Columbia are participating. Major financial support comes from the National Museum and the Provincial Government. In previous work at Nesikep Creek, Sanger had begun to develop an inter- esting sequence of five components. Microblades in three of these components suggest affinities with the Northwest Microblade tradition (cf. National Museum of Canada, Bulletin No. 193, Contrib. to Anthropology, 1961-62, Pt. 1, Paper No. 3). Prime objectives of the current investiga- tions are to elaborate and, if possible, to extend the local sequence, to place it on a firm chronological basis, and to determine the extra local affinities of the separate components. Except for acting as consultant on the Lochnore- Nesikep Creek project, C. E. Borden, University of British Columbia, will not be directly involved in field work dur- ing the 1964 season. Borden will be on sabbatical leave in 1964-65 to prepare final reports on the Fraser Canyon investigations (1959-63) and related projects. Financial support for processing these data is coming from the National Museum of Canada (Department of State) and the University of British Columbia Committee on Research. WASHINGTON. The archaeological research program at Washington State University has been strengthened by the development of new laboratory space and facilities. The Laboratory of Anthropology is now housed in a two- story building containing 17,000 sq. ft. of floor space. Only research activities are to be carried on in this facil- ity. The extensive remodeling that was necessary to adapt the building to the needs of anthropologists has now proceeded to the point where the archaeology, geochron- ology, and physical anthropology laboratories are largely completed and in use. It is hoped that the research space and facilities designated for the other areas of anthropol- ogy will be completed this next year. A number of research projects are planned for 1964. With support from the National Park Service, the third and final season of excavation at the important Marmes Rockshelter site will take place and the final report pre- pared for publication. This project will be directed in the field by Richard Daugherty. John Combes will direct the excavation of a small cave which, from surface indica- tions, appears to be rich in basketry and other perishable materials. This project is also supported by the National Park Service. Roderick Sprague will join the staff of the Laboratory next year and will direct the excavation of a large historic Nez Perce burial site. It is expected that this site will provide important information about early his- toric trade relations. This work is to be carried out under a contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. All three sites are in the Lower Monumental Reservoir area on the lower Snake River. Charles M. Nelson and David G. Rice will make archaeological surveys of the Little Goose and Asotin reservoirs on the Snake River and conduct test excava- tions in rockshelters in Mt. Rainier National Park. This work will be done under a contract with the National Park Service. Daugherty and Roald Fryxell, geologist and Director of the Geochronology Section of the Laboratory of Anthro- pology, will spend August and early September in the Dordogne region of southern France and in Spain taking stratigraphic sections of important paleolithic sites using the Smith-Moodie soil-monolith technique as adapted for archaeological use by Fryxell. The principal aims of this work are to preserve stratigraphic sections of the classic sites and to demonstrate the technique to European ar- chaeologists. This project is supported by the Wenner- Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. Robert Ackerman will return to Glacier Bay, Alaska, this summer to complete his archaeological survey of this region for the National Park Service. Studies of geochronology in the Columbia Plateau area by Roald Fryxell, supported by the National Science Foundation, have resulted in further clarification of the Mazama-Glacier Peak ash problem. Volcanic ash from the Mazama eruption about 6600 years ago was deposited throughout the Pacific Northwest just before the peak conditions of the Altithermal climatic interval and occurs in distinctive stratigraphic and physiographic positions. At the time of this report, two papers outlining field and laboratory criteria for distinguishing between the Glacier Peak and Mazama eruptions are in press (Powers and Wilcox; Fryxell). A radiocarbon date for the Glacier Peak eruption has been obtained from shell collected in association with coarse Glacier Peak ash in lower Grand Coulee, a few miles north of Soap Lake, Washington. This date, 12,000 + 310 years B.P. (WSU-155; R. M. Chat- ters, personal communication), not only is a close upper- limiting date for the Glacier Peak eruption but also dates a lake mapped by Fryxell throughout most of the Lower Grand Coulee. Because Glacier Peak ash is present also on the Great Terrace of the Columbia and Okanogan rivers far north of the terminal moraine of the Okanogan Glacier lobe, the date also confirms previous estimates that northern Washington had been largely free of con- tinental glaciation 12,000 years ago. Additional studies of the geologic history of the middle Columbia and Okanogan rivers will be undertaken during the next two years for the National Park Service as a part of salvage operations in the Wells Reservoir area. Washington State University's Carbon Dating Labo- ratory is completing its second year of operation and service to archaeologists of the Northwest and through- out the world. From the establishment of the Laboratory in 1962, efforts have been made to get a better under- standing of the carbon-dating method as it applies to archaeology. Modifications in procedures and apparatus have been made accordingly. A program of cross checking 245</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY of dated samples with other laboratories has been initi- ated in an attempt to increase the reliability of dates. Of particular concern are possible sources of contamina- tion which could cause dating discrepancies, such as contamination with radon gas, fallout carbon-14, animal excreta, and other agents. The Laboratory is adding a 512-channel analyzer to its analytical apparatus within the coming month. This addition will make possible the detection of gamma-emitting contaminants and neutron- activation analysis of other contaminants to determine the nature, cause, and possibly the source of contamination. During the past six months, the Laboratory has doubled its counting capacity, in part due to the addition of a capability for the carbon-14 and tritium (H3) dating of water. Major activity at the University of Washington during the academic year involved work in the Laboratory and the writing of reports on previous field work. Progress continues to be made toward the final, integrated report on the Priest Rapids-Wanapum projects. Brian Holmes is in the final phases of analysis and interpretation of the 1962 excavations at the Schaake Village site (45KT17). Interpretation of these materials is taking into account a new radiocarbon date by the University of Washington Radiocarbon Laboratory. While final calculations have yet to be made, an age of about 3400 years is indicated for the deeply buried materials at the contact of the aeolian silts and river gravels. In addition, Robert Kidd has completed a final report on nearby sites 45KT13 and 45KT12. Sonja Solland is continuing analysis of a pit- house site in the upper Wanapum Reservoir, 45GR68. Separate but related research is being carried on by Nancy Stenholm with regard to the faunal remains. Analysis has been completed of materials from the key Sourdough Creek site (45YK5), as well as from a site at the head of the Priest Rapids (45KT17). Environmental studies of sites in these reservoirs are under way by Roald Fryxell at Washington State University. Early in the year, Gar Grabert submitted an interim r:port on the 1963 excavations at the Fort Okanogan site near the mouth of the Okanogan River. A second inter- 'm report on the Wells project by T. G. Sloan and dealing with excavations in aboriginal sites will be submitted to sponsoring agencies shortly. A series of petroglyphs near the main highway along the Wells Reservoir are being salvaged through coopera- tion of the Douglas County Public Utility District (spon- sors of the Wells Archaeological Salvage project) and the Okanogan County Historical Society. Very appropriately, the petroglyphs will be on permanent display at the site of the dam. Reconnaissance of federally supported state highway construction projects continues under Brian Holmes. He has just completed a report on an emergency excavation undertaken in a highway relocation area along the John Day Reservoir in Klickitat County, Washington. In the uppermost stratum the site (45KL50) contains a mixture of early and late materials. However, two clearly deline- ated strata are found more deeply buried and contain artifacts of the early and early middle period of this section of the Columbia valley (lanceolate, side-notched, and large stemmed points, and edge-ground cobbles). Archaeological survey in the Sammamish River valley during the summer and autumn of 1963 failed to produce any sites worthy of excavation. However, further effort early in 1964, together with the report of a cooperative amateur archaeologist, resulted in the discovery of two sites. One of these is stratified in alluvial deposits along the river and is in an area of extensive widening and straightening by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Through a fortunate combination of circumstances it is possible to excavate the site (45K19) with a class in archaeological field methods under the direction of Robert Greengo. Materials from the site thus far range from choppers and lanceolate points related to the Olcott complex to a fairly wide variety of stemmed and un- stemmed projectile points of cryptocrystalline rocks. Some of these points appear to relate to those of the late middle period in the Columbia valley. In addition, a ground adz fragment and a microblade core add further interest to the site. The other site (45K110) exhibits crude basalt, percussion-chipped implements and lanceolate blades typical of the Olcott complex, together with a very few projectile points of fine-grained materials thought to be later. Major activities for the 1964 summer season will involve a field school in the Wells Reservoir area and continuing reconnaissance and possibly excavation in highway con- struction areas. A number of other salvage projects are pending. Funds have been granted by the National Museum of Canada, the Province of British Columbia, and the Uni- versity of Washington to enable David Sanger to pursue an intensive excavation project in the Lillooet area of the Fraser valley. OREGON. A new policy was established this year at the University of Oregon: all archaeology in Oregon and immediate environs will be the responsibility of the Mu- seum of Natural History. The Department of Anthro- pology will be responsible for research related to the interests of the members of that department outside Oregon. This is no great departure from previous policy but rather is a clarification of the position of the Museum of Natural History, brought about because of the retire- ment of L. S. Cressman who had been the head of both departments. Albert C. Spaulding is now the head of the Department of Anthropology, and J. Arnold Shotwell is now the head of the Museum of Natural History. There will be continuing cooperation between the two depart- ments, which is essential for success in the archaeological program of Oregon. Research on several projects is in progress or has been completed, and several new projects have been started. The sixth season was completed on the John Day Dam project, which included a fifth year of work on the Wild- cat Canyon site (35GM9) and test excavations and a survey of Blalock Island. The work at Wildcat Canyon was directed by David L. Cole; that on Blalock Island 246 [ VOL. 30, No. 2, 1964</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH was directed by Frank C. Leonhardy. The major objective of the Wildcat Canyon excavations this year was to com- plete the sequence of house types, gather more material from the earliest occupations, and fill in voids in the cultural sequence. This was accomplished, and there is now a fairl.y complete archaeological record for over 6500 years. The earliest houses in evidence were built over shallow, basin-shaped depressions. Next there is a semi- subterranean house with dry-masonry walls. Then there is what seems to be a semisubterranean, multiple-family dwelling with walls of horizontal planks, and finally the semisubterranean pithouses typical of the intermontane area of eastern Washington and Oregon. The major objectives of the Blalock Island excavations were to find the extent of occupation and how long the island was occupied. It was hoped also that evidence could be found of an undisturbed site that was occupied from the pre- historic period into the historic period, but the search was unsuccessful. During the summer of 1964, work will continue on Blalock Island and other sites in the John Day Dam Reservoir. W. A. Davis conducted a survey in Crater Lake National Park and Oregon Caves National Monument during the 1963 summer. Both areas were found to be devoid of archaeological materials. Under the direction of Adrian D. Anderson, the third and last year of work on the Salt Caves Dam project in southern Oregon was completed in 1963. Several house pits were excavated, including some which produced potsherds in quantity. This site, which is just across the Oregon-California border, has produced the first pottery of significance in Oregon. In the fall of 1963, a survey was conducted on the Illinois River in southwestern Oregon in connection with the Buzzard's Roost Dam project. Several sites were located in an area which has been an archaeological void. Also in the fall of 1963, the "Camp Creek site" in central Oregon was investigated. The area had been reserved by the Department of Interior as a potential "early man site," as the result of action taken by a collector who found what he thought to be a "Clovis" point. Investigation showed the area to be a workshop-quarry where crypto- crystalline rock had weathered out of Oligocene basalt flows. Since the surface throughout the area was exposed Miocene deposits, there were no excavations. In addition to continued work on the John Day Dam project in 1964, there will be excavations on the Mason Dam project near Baker, Oregon, on the Fall Creek Dam project near Eugene, and a survey of the Oregon Dunes area which is being considered as a national park. All of these projects are under contracts with the National Park Service. IDAHO. The 1963 excavation programs conducted by the Idaho State University Museum were reported in the previous Current Research in the Northwest. Planned for 1964 is the fourth and concluding season of excavation in the Grave Creek-Rocky Canyon locality of north- central Idaho, initiation of extensive excavations at the nearby Whitebird Hill locality, and a second season of testing in the Hells Canyon region of the Snake River. All of these projects have bearing on Nez Perce prehistory in particular and Plateau prehistory in general. The four- year excavation phase of the Birch Creek project in east- ern Idaho, which relates to the prehistory of the Northern Shoshoni, was completed in 1963, and the first two of a proposed series of four monographs were published. Starting with Vol. 7, No. 1, of Tebiwa, a continuing se- ries of notes on experiments in flintknapping, carried out by Don E. Crabtree and written by B. Robert Butler, will be published. Crabtree has been conducting experiments in flintknapping for more than 30 years, but only recently has an attempt been made to publish the results of his experi- ments. At the same time, efforts are being made to record his work on video-film for purposes of study and train- ing in prehistoric flint technology. In addition, plans have been outlined for a handbook and an instructional film for classroom use. RICHARD D. DAUGHERTY CALIFORNIA Land leveling for a new parking lot at Torrance County Beach, Los Angeles County, recently removed the last remnant of an important archaeological site. Although it lay on a cliff directly overlooking the beach, the site contained practically no marine shell. Seed- grinding implements - handstones and milling stones - make up the largest category of artifacts recovered by William and Edith Wallace (Long Beach State College) during earthmoving activities. The collection also in- cludes a number of hammerstones, some of which are pitted, and a few crude choppers. Among the smaller chipped specimens are large and coarsely flaked projectile points, broken knives, and core and flake scrapers. An unusual find of considerable interest is a chipped stone "crescent." The plentiful milling stones and mullers testify to a seed-collecting and seed-grinding subsistence, whereas the near absence of shellfish remains suggests that the site had been inhabited by an inland people who had recently moved to the seashore and had not yet acquired a taste for this form of diet. The nature of the cultural materials indicates that the site belongs to the Early Mill- ing Stone horizon of the southern Californian coast and, judging from their general simplicity of form and manu- facture, to an early phase of this horizon. A research center, basically for the study of Early Man but encompassing the whole picture of archaeological research in the desert area, has been dedicated by the Archeological Survey Association of Southern California and the San Bernardino County Museum. It is antici- pated that comparative materials from many areas will be incorporated in the collections, as well as early material from the southern Great Basin. The San Bernardino County Museum has completed a preliminary survey of archaeological sites surrounding Troy Lake in the Manix Basin, San Bernardino County. Pinto Basin, Amargosa, and recent Shoshonean materials 247</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY dominate the artifact inventory. The Museum is pre- paring a publication on this survey. Chico State College students, under the direction of Keith Johnson, are excavating a large Maidu village near the Sacramento River in Butte County. The spring semes- ter was spent exposing a burned semisubterranean house. Materials recovered indicate that the house was occupied around 300 years ago. Charles Rozaire (Los Angeles County Museum) has completed archaeological surveys and excavations for the National Park Service on two Channel Islands, Santa Barbara and Anacapa, a part of Channel Islands National Monument. Adan Treganza of San Francisco State College is work- ing in the Point Reyes National Seashore area, excavating sites threatened by campground construction. He is also making a thorough survey of archaeological sites in this newest addition to the National Park System. Late in the fall of 1963, it was learned that the C. W. Harris site in the San Dieguito Valley, San Diego County, will soon become unavailable for excavation. The impor- tance of this site lies in the occurrence of materials of three culture patterns stratigraphically superimposed and covering a span of several thousand years: the San Dieguito, La Jollan, and Western Yuman complexes. Although excavations had been carried out in 1938 by the late Malcolm J. Rogers and in 1959 by C. N. Warren and D. L. True, only a very small part of the site had been explored. Hence it was thought desirable to obtain a larger sample of data from this site. A project was started during the spring semester of 1964, utilizing a class in archaeological field methods of San Diego State College. Under the direction of Paul H. Ezell, two trenches have been excavated, and four others are near completion. Possibilities for radiocarbon dates are good. The Yuman occupation of the site was more extensive than previously recognized. The excavation of a second house pit at the historic Maidu village of Shilteam moma hiikuma (But-S182) in the reservoir area of the Thermalito Diversion Dam, Oro- ville Project, Butter County, has been completed by Wil- liam Olsen, assisted by Stephen Humphreys and Charles Smith. Smith is a Maidu whose interest and abilities have greatly facilitated archaeological investigations in the area. The Smith family and other Maidu have shown great interest in salvage archaeology within their homeland and have volunteered much ethnogeographic informa- tion of value to the archaeological program. The two houses recorded at this site were destroyed by fire, leaving a reasonably clear record of house con- struction. The second house, when exposed, had the remains of a center post near the central fire hearth. This feature has not been noted previously in the area. These houses were evidently conical bark structures with shallow, saucer-shaped floors, central fire hearths, and unshaped stone mortars set level with the floors. One house had such mortars, one on each side of the fire. One mortar had a pestle lying beside it. A second site (But-S157) within the limits of the same project area has been partially excavated. It is a physi- cally and culturally stratified site whose upper levels are coeval with the central California Late Horizon, possibly Phase I and certainly Phase II. The lower levels are coeval with the Middle Horizon as indicated by the projectile- point styles and general cultural content. Data obtained from this site will aid in clarifying the cultural sequence in the Butte County area. Geologic test trenches opened by a bulldozer west of Wedel's site No. 1 at Buena Vista Lake, Kern County, have revealed some 15 to 20 burials. Investigations were made by Francis Riddell and William Olsen for the Cali- fornia Department of Water Resources. A record was obtained for most of the burials and collections. The latter include a large steatite bowl with rim incising, saucer-shaped Olivella beads, asphalted basketry, and abalone ornaments. Notable for this series of burials was the fact that some semiflexed burials came from a stratum lying below the upper midden. The only specimens from this lower level were a well-shaped mano, a ribbon-flaked obsidian blade, and saucer-shaped Olivella beads. The beads and the obsidian blade were associated with two burials. The remnants of the site will be heavily damaged by an aqueduct that will pass through it. Patti Palumbo has completed excavations at Pefia Adobe, Solano County, under a contract with the Cen- tral California Archaeological Foundation as a part of a highway salvage project. Her excavations, conducted with student labor from Sacramento State College, re- vealed that Pefia Adobe was built on a prehistoric-his- toric Indian site. Jerald Johnson, with William Beeson and a Sacramento State College field class, has concluded work in the Camanche Reservoir, Calaveras County. The Old Bridge site (Cal-237) has produced data on Early period mate- rials. The archaeological information obtained from work in the Camanche Reservoir appears to be sufficiently comprehensive to outline cultural development from the Early period to historic contact. Louis A. Payen, with William Beeson and members of the Sacramento State College field class, has investigated central California foothill burial caves. Excavation in one of these caves in Calaveras County produced a consid- erable quantity of Middle period material, which is shed- ding light on the use of these caves. Grants by C. M. Goethe and the Central California Archeological Foun- dation, both of Sacramento, have aided this work. FRANCIS A. RIDDELL GREAT BASIN CALIFORNIA. An archaeological survey was made along the proposed Southern California Edison Company elec- tric distribution line in Grapevine Canyon, Death Valley National Monument. The reconnaissance, carried out by William and Edith Wallace, resulted in the discovery of 11 sites, five open encampments, five rockshelters, and a hunting blind. All seem to have seen use during the late 248 [ VOL. 30, No. 2, 1964</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH aboriginal period. Glass beads and commercially manu- factured items recovered at two of the sites demonstrate that their occupation continued into historic times. A University of California at Los Angeles Archaeo- logical Survey field party conducted salvage excavations at an apparent Lake Mohave site near Baker. The camp- site lies on the route of Highway 466 and 91, which is now being widened. Artifacts found consisted of large blades and heavy service tools, many heavily stained with desert varnish. Hans Nordstrom was in charge of the work. NEVADA. Exploratory excavations have been completed in Pintwater Cave on the Indian Springs Bombing Range, 60 mi. north of Las Vegas. The archaeological deposit in the cave is deep and gives evidence of a lengthy occupa- tion. Radiocarbon dates of 9200 and 6500 B.P. have been obtained from charcoal and dart shafts. Artifacts uncov- ered during the digging include a number of corner- notched dart points. The excavations were carried out under the direction of Charles Rozaire (Los Angeles County Museum). UTAH. Present archaeological activities at the Univer- sity of Utah consist mainly of the preparation of reports on work announced in previous sections of Current Research.
