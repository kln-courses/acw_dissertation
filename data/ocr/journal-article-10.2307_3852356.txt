<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERT SCHULTZ The Accurate Poem IS THERE A BETTER, LESS RESTRICTING QUALITY tO ask of a poem than accuracy? And is there a quality more slippery to define? The demand for accuracy does not dictate subject or style. The accurate poem may be plain or elaborate, "objective" or "subjective," may render experi? ence actual or imagined. The accurate poem may be traditional or innovative: conventions can always be revived by genius, and strange? ness is sometimes required to dislocate us into freshness of percep? tion. Literary influence may be apparent in the accurate poem and need not be judged a fault; strong poets choose their influences and transmute them under the demands of their need. A poetics of accuracy does commit us to the old-fashioned notion (doubtless soon to be the new-fangled notion) that language is referential. It does not, however, commit us to simple-mindedness. The subtle interpenetrations of sense, thought, and emotion, of received perception and projected conception, make experience a nuanced and shifting thing. We will need every gesture, every direction and indirection to communicate it. The great enemy of accuracy is mannerism. The poet of real accomplishment engages in the unspeakably difficult labor of making the poem that renders the world that he knows, and over time a style is made, a voice achieved adequate to the poet's occasions. But no writer, however great, is at his or her best at every moment, and the attentive reader can discriminate those moments when the bead is lost and the voice proceeds in the habits of its style, fallen into mannerism. And some poets?some of them brilliant?are mannerists always. The drive for accurate registration in Herbert Morris' The Little Voices of the Pears1 is virtually obsessive, expressing itself in a layered style, as phrase after phrase is applied the way a painter might apply base color, tints, and glazes. In "For the Dark Ones," the poem which concludes the volume and which provides its title phrase, Morris attends to the ripening of wild pears as a figure of longing and threatened aspiration: . . . pears begin to ripen on the difficult slope beyond the sun, 1 THE LITTLE VOICES OF THE PEARS, by Herbert Morris. Harper 8c Row. $18.95; $11.95.</page><page sequence="2">ROBERT SCHULTZ 139 not according to schedule, my dear, dark one, a terrain inhospitable, forbidding, soil unpromising, weather foul at best, roots a conspiracy of aspiration, tangled, murky, chaotic, dense, unsplendid. . . . Here the successive noun phrases and then the piled adjectives grope toward what Morris elsewhere calls "the consolations of exactitude." His is a distinctive style, always laboring with patient attention against implied difficulty to register intuited essences rather than mere appearances. This sensibility will remind many readers of Henry James even before they read the letter poem written in the persona of William James addressing, from Brazil, his brother "Harry": You, with your taste for ambiguity, symbol, drama of the interior, nuance, half-tones, half-lights, glint of refractions, private experience; you, with your passion . . . for layer upon layer, your insistence on context, context, context, would quite thrive here. . . . William has groped in vain for a "scientific" way of understanding his new surroundings, yet still complains against his brother's preoccu? pation with "that whole realm of shadows." The poem implicitly criticizes William's habits of knowing, as another poem, "Lincoln's Hat," complains against the insufficiency of biographical fact as a way of knowing the human individual. For Morris, every person, emotion, scene, action, or object is almost infinitely faceted, and so he circles it with patient attention, enwrapping it in the folds of syntax. And in his poem, "Latin," a recollection of his schoolboy studies, he treats directly his fascination with the mysterious articulation of syntax, that "magic which ... if one might learn the phrasing . . . might lead . . . to one's life." (The ellipses here are mine; anyone wishing to quote Morris in brief will find himself choosing among possible kernel sentences scattered over several lines?and the sense of multiple possibilities is another aspect of this poet's accuracy.) In Morris' best passages the parallel phrases and listed nouns, verbs, and modifiers nudge and jostle one another in such a way that they are mutually qualifying and illuminating. This is particularly true in "Reading to the Children," "The Ferry," "The Drowning of Immoral Women," and in much of the concluding poem, "For the Dark Ones." Throughout the collection Morris writes a poetry that interrogates the possibilities of language without loss of passion for his subjects. And he often treats historical subject matter in a way more satisfying than much American poetry has been able to do recently. However, one recognizes in Morris' work that a poet's</page><page sequence="3">140 THE HUDSON REVIEW strengths are intimately related to his weaknesses. Laboring toward uncommon accuracy, Morris demands a singularly patient reader willing to move forward haltingly among the commas. His style is so consistent and so consistently elaborate that one must continually be reassured that it is required by the demands of accuracy. Unfortu? nately, there are passages in which the parallel phrases flirt with redundancy and the repetitions do not heighten emotion but seem merely a tic of style, and then Morris' verse seems extremely man? nered, habitual. Might there not be at least some moments that are most accurately rendered by the swift, incisive sentence? And should we hear Morris' characteristic phrasing in the mouth of every one of his personae, even when his speaker is an adolescent named Emily writing to one of her young friends in the poem, "Olana, Summer, 1872"? A distinctive voice, developed so that the author can be accurate to the subjects of his choosing, can also trap and arrest him. Looking forward to Morris' next collection (this book is his third), it will be interesting to see whether he can continue in the strength of his developed voice and at the same time achieve a more various and flexible style. For Wesley McNair, in The Town of No,2 to be accurate is to convince the reader that the poem has brought us to the inner reality of other lives. This was the aim of several of Morris' poems, as well, but the two poets could hardly exhibit more different styles. McNair is a practi? tioner of the plain style, but he is an artful one. His free verse features deliberately placed line breaks and occasional rhymes and half- rhymes, as in "Sue Reed Walking," which presents a very old woman walking across her room, . . . struggling against a current she cannot see. O she doesn't know when her glasses flash up from that depth quite where she is. . . . Each line-ending enacts a crisis of progress as the woman teeters forward, and each fall across the white space between stanzas is suspenseful, particularly the ones here which follow the portentous words "O" and "depth." McNair's art is driven by empathy and seeks, in his New England 2 THE TOWN OF NO, by Wesley McNair. David R. Godine. $9.95.</page><page sequence="4">ROBERT SCHULTZ 141 settings, the weak, the inarticulate, the ill, the unfortunate? inhabitants of his imagined "Town of No." In the book's first poem, "The Last Time Shorty Towers Fetched the Cows," McNair encour? ages us to reconsider a life that has been reduced to anecdote. Shorty Powers died when he walked, drunk, off a barn roof to fetch the cows?a foolish and pitiful end?but the poet wants to recover that extraordinary last moment, not as a joke at Powers' expense, but from the subject's perspective. "Let us imagine," he gently suggests, "Shorty is listening / to what seems to be the voice / of a lost heifer, just breaking / upward." "And let us think," he quietly instructs, "that when he walks / with such odd purpose down that hill / jagged with shingles, he suddenly feels it / open into the wide, incredibly green / meadow where all the cows are." Again the line-endings?on "break? ing," "feels it," and "green"?are expressive, rendering a surmised moment of surprise and wonderment within an otherwise muddled life. Those phrases, "Let us imagine" and "let us think," stand over the collection, the moral imperatives of living in community. In "The Hand," for instance, no one notices the normal hand of the woman whose other hung "high up at her side / like a fin," so McNair focusses on that good hand by which the woman could be known most accurately. How we live in and are known by our bodies is a central obsession of this book, and the result, usually, is pathos. Over and over we read phrases such as: "he was inside his body / and could never leave" ("The Faith Healer"); "He walked / with his helpless father / closed away in his body" ("Breath"); "he has lived in this body this thing" ("The Abandonment"); and "the pitiless body took him / to a mirror / which showed / the eyes / in a face / immense and dying, / who he was" ("The Thin Man"). Sometimes, however, pathos is leavened by humor, as when the bad guys look up from jail at Superman in "The Thugs of Old Comics," "thinking, like you, how it always gets down / to the same old shit: no fun, no dough, / no power to rise out of their bodies." When McNair goes slightly wrong?either into sentimentality or preciosity?it is a failure of accuracy. In "Remembering Aprons," "Bald Spot," and "The Longing of the Feet," the aprons, bald spot, and feet become not the means but the end of contemplation, synecdoche fails, and the poet's empathy does not reach through the object to the life of which it is a part. Given McNair's subject matter, however, it is remarkable how little sentimentality there is in this volume. Some of the book's most powerful poems, "Killing the Animals," "To My Father, Dying in a Supermarket," "My Brother Inside the Revolving Doors," "The Minister's Death," and "The Abandonment," are those in which there is most sentiment, but which exclude sentimentality by an uncanny attention to the telling detail. We should not mind if that detail is invented and the poem's accuracy</page><page sequence="5">142 THE HUDSON REVIEW is really the illusion of accuracy. In poetry accuracy is at the service of truth, not fact. While McNair has tried to imagine the inner lives of others, Killarney Clary, in her first book, Who Whispered Near Me,3 has attempted to render the moment-to-moment texture of her own interior experience. But how does one write a transcript of the inner life? Clary dives deep, is subjective almost to the point of privacy, and so the issue of difficulty will be central for her readers. They will wrestle with the question of whether the linguistic innovation they discover here, the "strangeness," is or is not at the service of accuracy. This is a demanding book consisting of 49 prose poems grouped into five sections, and neither the individual pieces nor the sections carry titles. In the poems we are dislocated into the alien realm of another's subjectivities by discontinuities, private associations, unspec? ified dramatic situations, and the subversion of common usage. In the book's third poem we come upon the sentences: "Out and back?a mountain shape compacting in the distance, the name of a dead dog in a city behind the mountain. There now. Here then." Such baffling passages will exasperate many readers who will decide either that this poetry is utterly private or that it is a mannered imitation of the hugely influential style of John Ashbery. But there is a case to be made that the difficulties of this poetry?many of them, at least?are necessary for the sake of accurate rendering. It may be that only strangeness can carry us into the unique terrain of another's pensees. Clary's poetry maps the part of life that's "just noise, the way things go on," and so it renders the texture of dailiness: "How all things change inside a person, settle and ride." We also catch glimpses of external actions that imply narratives of relationship but which are registered deep within the sensibility that notes with minute attention "the shift in weather between us." At a higher level of generalization, there are candid statements of resolution, often sadly qualified: "I believe in promises?that we are obligated by a simple word that couldn't be held back. I will be there if you need me, if you can reach me, if I can hear you." And there are philosophic and religious reflections: "God's familiar with my tricks?precise requests, then total surrender. ..." Clary's choice of form can be seen as an attempt at accuracy. At first one thinks: here at least is a poet who will not give us the pseudo-lines and pseudo-stanzas that we find in so much of the unskilled free verse of the moment. And then the expressive justice of Clary's form suggests itself: the prose form asserts that experience, at the level at which this poet wants to seize it, does not present itself parsed and 3 WHO WHISPERED NEAR ME, by Killarney Clary. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $14.95.</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT SCHULTZ 143 articulated into lines and stanzas, but arrives in a continual, unrelent? ing stream. Clary's strongest pieces are those in which the associative connec? tions and the unity of meditation are clearest. The book's third poem is an emotional excursion into the meaning of the Vietnam War. Another poem, beginning "Life is boundless," effectively uses associ? ations derived from having seen Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. Another, about missing an absent friend, contains the sentence: "Your voice would settle the way one thing should follow another, would stupefy my fear, and your hold would quiet the lines of everything leading everywhere." After reading poems such as these, one wishes Clary would squeeze from her work the utter privacies and the echoes of untransmuted influence that will undermine some readers' faith in her attempt to write the accurate poem. Eamon Grennan is an Irish poet living and teaching in the U.S., and What Light There Is and Other Poems4 is his first volume published in America. In poems about family, about domestic and natural detail, and the daily weather of the emotional life, Grennan seeks the calm apprehension of beauty. Depicting "Things of the ordinary morning world," he works toward moments of quiet epiphany. After six days of storm, Grennan relishes the gray still day when "Only a sort of steady domestic peace / Secures all animations in the garden, / Giving everything its due." And, in "Raeburn's Skater," the poet declares: "I want his delicate balance, his / Sturdy sane domesticated grace." And moments of satisfaction come, as in the poem "Accidents," when "I'm all at once all there." Attempting to give "everything its due" and to be "all at once all there," Grennan is committed to a poetics of accuracy, and as we compare the first and third sections of this book we have an oppor? tunity to observe the poet's work growing in both sharpness and amplitude. Section one, "Wildly for Days," was issued in Dublin as a collection in 1983; section three, "What Light There Is," was pub? lished there as a book in 1987. In subject and style the two parts are similar, but some differences are significant. One of them is the poet's handling of personification and anthropomorphism. Grennan is a generous poet who desires the stabilities of domestic love and natural beauty. Some of the most moving passages in the earlier work are those in which he convinces us that he has discovered and rendered a small remnant of Eden. One such glimpse occurs in "Fall": On a still morning the shallow pond Is full of kissing: little narcissi? 4 WHAT LIGHT THERE IS AND OTHER POEMS, by Eamon Grennan. North Point Press. $10.95.</page><page sequence="7">144 THE HUDSON REVIEW Sandpiper sanderling killdeer plover? Dip to their brilliant twins In the motionless water. This is a credible beauty. The passage convinces with an accuracy that depends in no small measure upon the delicate assonance and alliteration which mirror the delicacy of action. But as the poem goes on to personify the adjacent flowers, the poet's desire for beauty overcomes the scene before him. And patiently gazing at themselves In the mirroring water The flowers of the season Murmur their own sufficient names? Touch-me-not loosestrife forget-me-not? Lovers of the clear pool, the crisp morning. As the image grows conventional?the flowers gazing, murmuring, and loving?we are chiefly conscious of the poet's intentions rather than the scene that moves him. Ceasing to see with him, we instead feel him push for his effect, and so we resist. Personification and anthropomorphism become less dominant in the later work, but even when they appear they are less conventional and so more convincing. In "A Closer Look" Grennan declares that he is sick of the way we live, "wasting everything we touch," and so he has come to admire the porcupine, possum, raccoon, skunk, and fox for their "delicate razor's-edge economies." He imagines them as they "follow their noses through a sphere / of sudden death and instant satisfactions" . . . sniffing the wind the way lovers browse word by word by word first letters for what stays salted and aromatic between the lines. Here the comparison of the animals to lovers is surprising and just, and it is an apt way to dramatize the poet's own desire for a more intense, instinctive life. Grennan's skill and generosity are apparent throughout this good book, but the later poems are more fully developed, reaching broader levels of thematic significance, yet remaining grounded in close observation and strong feeling. Poems such as "The Nature of America," "At Home in Winter," "Morning: the Twenty-Second of March," and "Conjunctions" are fully articulated meditations flush with accuracies in which we are "startled into another life / for a fiery instant," or into "the / dread here-now" or into "this stillness in which we go on happening."</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT SCHULTZ 145 Some accuracies are larger than others, more multiple, more com? prehensive. Rodney Jones, in his third book, Transparent Gestures,5 takes on a remarkable range of subjects?from political power, finance, and work, to blasphemy, soap operas, and the bearing of waitresses. At the same time, his poems combine a variety of modes: within a single poem he can be discursive and concrete, narrative and symbolic, rhetorical and musical, voluble and precise. And his best poems join intense feeling with sophisticated intelligence, following the bead of human response through demanding contexts. "My Manhood," set on a train as the poet tours Italy, begins with an old recollection of working on a construction crew and being physi? cally beaten by the foreman. As a result, the poet reflects upon the monuments of European cultural achievement with ambivalence, hearing always "the one who had laid the crossties / whisper, 'On your knees, like it, now kiss it'. . . ." Therefore: . . . not the artisan of palaces and cathedrals but the soldier filled me, the Hun included me, helpless before his wrath, as he drove south, indomitable, priapic beast who could claim all beauty with his fists. . . . In this poem and throughout the collection, the personal and the public interrogate and shape one another, while high diction and rhetorical figure ("the soldier filled me, the Hun included me") consort with the common and the colloquial. We often think of rhetoric and poetry as opposed terms, but Jones is among those poets who remind us that faithful rhetoric is nothing but the mind discovering the accurate shape of its thought in language, a shape that can move others. "Winter Retreat: Homage to Martin Luther King, Jr." is a poem on the unpromising subject of a government-sponsored education conference held in a posh Balti? more hotel, but Jones makes of it an acute meditation on human and governmental failure and a moving homage to King. Parallel sen? tences freighted with ironies render the earnest ineffectuality of the conference: "We felt / substantive burdens lighter if we stated it right. . . . We walked / together beside the still waters of behavior? ism. . . . We moved very carefully in the valley of the shadow / of the darkest agreement error. We did not digress." Playing meaningful ironies upon the rhetoric and diction of the Twenty-third Psalm, Jones prepares for the self-accusing insight that concludes the poem: "we had wanted to make the world kinder, / but, in speaking proudly, we had failed a vision." 5 TRANSPARENT GESTURES, by Rodney Jones. Houghton Mifflin. $8.95.</page><page sequence="9">146 THE HUDSON REVIEW Jones writes a poetry of remarkable syntheses. In subject matter, he writes as easily of the factory and farm as of the classroom and conference room. His poetry is refreshingly intellectual, but he can also write "Sounds that // Go straight from the ear to / The heart." And nearly every poem of this collection suggests the inadequacy of believing that narrative and lyric are discrete poetic kinds. Poems such as "Mimosa," "News of the Cranes," "Carpe Diem," and "A Blasphe? my" combine discursive statement, narration, music, and image to achieve uncommon intellectual and emotional accuracies. And if poetry is to find its way to the heart of our culture's workings, it will do so by proving itself to be the most accurate of our linguistic instruments.
