<plain_text><page sequence="1">Representation of the Divine on the Babylonian Entitlement Monuments (kudurrus): Part I: Divine Symbols1 By Kathryn E. Slanski (New Haven) Believing , with Max Weber , that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun , I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretive one in search of meaning. C. Geertz , The Interpretation of Cultures Sun-disc, moon-crescent, lightning fork, mušhuššu- dragon - the immediately striking feature of a Babylonian Entitlement Monument (kudurru) is the array of divine symbols prominently sculpted upon its surface in relief (figs. 1-4). The Entitlement Monuments are a significant source of visual evidence for symbolic represen- tations of Mesopotamian gods.2 Previous scholar- ship devoted to the imagery of the artifacts has been concerned largely with identification of in- dividual symbolic representations. Ursula Seidl's indispensable study, Die babylonischen Kudurru- Reliefs : Symbole mesopotamischer Gottheiten ,3 investigates the symbols and their divine referents, and demonstrates that, with the exception of a few innovated to represent the gods of the Kas- site Dynasty (15th c. - 1 155), 4 the symbols found upon the Entitlement Monuments are firmly rooted in long established Mesopotamian religious ico- ') Portions of the remarks presented here were offered previously at the 46th RAI (Paris, July 2000) in the Workshop on the Inter-relationship Between Text and Image, and at the Harvard Workshop on Mesopo- tamian Religion, February 14, 2003. I am grateful to organizers P. -A. Beaulieu and P. Steinkeller for the invitation to present this material at Harvard, and to all the participants of the workshop for their comments. Grazie a E.

In light of these and other studies concerned with rep- resentation of the divine in Mesopotamia, this inquiry seeks to address the follow- ing questions: How is the divine repre- sented on the Babyloni- an Entitlement monu- ments? Where else can such rep- resentations be found? I. e., in what other cul- tural arenas would such representations have oc- casioned a response and what are the potential sources for the represen- tations? What was the visual affect of the representations? Specifically, for the pre- sent essay, what kind of response would the sym- bols have occasioned on the part of a viewer?7 nography. With the godly associations and indigenous Mesopotamian origin of almost all of the symbols established, this article aims to delineate the function of the symbols as they appear upon the artifacts, and to do so within the larger framework of (a) the intended function of the Babylonian Entitlement Monuments, and (b) the roles played by divine symbols within Babylonian culture and society. This essay may be counted among other scholarly efforts to come to terms with representations of the divine in Mesopotamia,5 including those stimulated by the recent publications of the mis pí 'Washing of the Mouth' ritual texts pertaining to the animation and 5) Major publications include A.

In the specific context of the Babylonian Entitlement monuments, how do the divine representations con- tribute to the overall function of the artifact? Why were such representations incorporated into this artifact genre; or, what was the point of the repre- sentations?

(Canonical), representations chiefly associated with Entitlement Monuments dating from the reign of Meli- Šipak (1186-1172) down to the end of the life span of the artifacts in the 7th century.8 These are the familiar images associated with the Entitlement Monuments, depicting a divine symbol or combination of symbolic elements in association with a squared, possibly archi- tecturally stylized, base or other type of pedestal or stand (e. g., figs. 1-4). Representations associated with SeidPs Pre-canonical categories, e. g., anthropomor- phic demons and "Mischwesen," such as the centaur and the lion-man that are characteristic of earlier mem- bers of the genre, are not considered for the purpose of this inquiry. In the course of investigating the function of the divine symbols belonging to the canonical reper- toire, comparable depictions of divine symbols on other artifacts, chiefly on cylinder seals and upon Assyrian stelae, will also be considered. This essay will argue that the symbolic imagery sculpted upon the Entitlement Monuments are not so much representa- tions of the gods as they are representations of divine symbols that stood in Babylonian temples and played 8) For Seidl' s proposed canon of symbolic representations appearing on the Entitlement Monuments, see Seidl, Kudurru- Reliefs 1988 (1968), pp. 73-93. a key role in the determination and enforcement of justice.9 As three-dimensional durable representations of symbols of the gods, these sculpted images were regarded as performing a divinely sanctioned legal function ensuring the eternal non-violation and mainte- nance of the terms detailed in the accompanying in- scriptions. Additional questions about the selection of indi- vidual divine symbols are left to future study; these include: Can the choice of divine symbols on a particular monument be correlated with subject matter of the inscription? With individual patrons? With geo- graphic setting? Are there variations in the representational conventions that can be tracked over time? Can these variations be correlated with developments observable in other features of the Entitlement Monuments? Ursula Seidl has proposed that a canon was instituted for the divine symbols sculpted upon the artifacts.10 Does the establishment of a canon for the divine symbols correlate with comparable developments in repre- sentational convention in other media? Can variations in the representations be correlated with developments evidenced in textual genres? With developments in religion, or in social, economic or political history? The Babylonian Entitlement Monuments: Text and Image The Babylonian Entitlement monuments are inscri- bed and sculpted stone artifacts originating in southern Mesopotamia and dating from the 14th to the 7th centuries B CE. The inscriptions detail acquisition of income-producing entitlements and include measures - prohibitions and curses - intended to protect and per- petuate claim to those entitlements. The entitlements themselves are typically royal grants of agricultural land, although grants of temple sinecures and exemp- tions from tax and labor obligations customarily due to the crown are also attested, as are non-royal land purchases and gifts. The texts are composed in a fairly high register of Middle Babylonian and follow a discernible struc- 9) The interpretation presented here was initially inspired by an article of Rivkah Harris, "The Journey of the Divine Weapon," AS 16 {Studies Landsberger), to which I also owe a number of the Old Babylonian text references cited in the following pages. It should be noted that Stephanie Dally proposed a connection between the divine symbols on the so- called " kudurrus " and Babylonian juridical practice in her article, "The God §almu and the Winged Disk,'" Iraq 48 (1986): 85-101; p. 100. 10) Seidl, Kudurru-Reliefs 1988 (1968), pp. 73-93.</page><page sequence="4">Representation of the Divine on the Babylonian Entitlement Monuments {kudurrus) I 311 ture.11 The relief sculptures depict divine symbols and scenes; the scenes have been further categorized as cultic and non-cultic.12 What sets the Entitlement Monuments apart from regular legal texts documenting the transfer of property is their extraordinary form. Fashioned out of stone instead of clay, inscribed in monumental script, embel- lished with divine curses and with visual imagery, and placed in temples, these artifacts appropriate the form of royal monuments. Designated in their own inscrip- tions as ncirûs , '(stone) stelae' or '(stone) monuments', the Entitlement Monuments also appropriate the au- thority inherent in the royal monumental form.

One passage, oft-cited in previous efforts to confront the symbols, offers what would seem to be verbal descriptions of the symbols carved upon the very monument. (Akkadian words used to refer to the carved symbols are highlighted in bold type): Seat ahd divine headdress of Anu, king of the heavens; the gergilu-bird, courier of Enlil, lord of the lands; www-emblem and Goat-fish, the great sanctuary of Ea; Šulpa^, Išhara, and Aruru; crescent, trough, procession boat of Sin; blazing sun-disc of the great judge, Šamaš; star-shaped emblem of Ištar, mistress of the lands; fierce bull-calf of Adad, son of Anu; raging Girra messenger of Nuska; Šuqamuna and Šumaliyya, gods who love one another; Nirah, messenger of Ištaran, Šar-ur, Šar-gaz, and Meslamta^; reed basket, the great (cosmic) cable of the Esikilla - 17 emblems of the great gods - May (they) be the adversary (of one who would contest)!

In fact, on no single Entitlement Monument does the list of gods named in the curses tally with the array of gods represented by the symbols.16 Thus, the role of the symbols cannot be so straightforward as to simply "illustrate" visually the gods invoked verbal- ly in the text. Indeed, as has been argued persuasive- ly by Winter, the relationship between text and image on Mesopotamian monuments is complementary and complex; neither can the text be said to "explain" the imagery nor the imagery be said to "illustrate" the text.17 Nonetheless, definite points of correspondence between the written text and the visual imagery can be demonstrated for a number of the artifacts under consideration here.18 There can be little doubt that the inscriptions and reliefs were composed with one another in mind. In order to facilitate explication of passages evi- dencing text-image correspondence, a brief presenta- tion of the structure of the inscriptions is provided below. Description of the structure of the texts is followed by investigation of specific terminology used in the Entitlement Monument inscriptions to refer to the sculpted divine symbols. Structure of the Babylonian Entitlement Monument Inscriptions By and large, the inscriptions conform to a fairly regular pattern. Each inscription can be divided into two major parts, termed here the Operative and the Imprecative divisions.19 These two divisions in turn 16) Black, Green, and Rickards, Gods , Demons and Symbols 1992, p. 16. 17) I.

Syntactically and semantically, the Imprecative division, that is, section (d), the prohibi- tions, together with section (e), the curses, constitute a single, extended, conditional sentence: (d) imprecations {If} such-and-such a person does x, or y, or z, (e) curses {then} may DNj do this to him! may DN2 do that to him!

The parallels cited above demonstrate that the divine sym- bols were thought to function in tandem with the divine curses: they serve to protect and preserve the narû and the entitlement detailed in its inscribed text.27 Such a conclusion, however, only raises another ques- tion: How, according to Babylonian conceptualization, do the divine symbols perform that function? A closer examination of the precise terms employed in the inscriptions for the symbols may illuminate the cul- tural associations behind the compositional decision to employ visual representations of divine symbols in order to protect the monument and the entitlement it commemorates. Terminology In her discussion of "Symbolsockel," that is, the rectangular base or pedestal upon which the divine symbols are often depicted (as in, e. g., figs. 1-4), Seidl has already noted four terms referring to the symbols that occur together in the inscriptions: a/ešertu , kakku , šubtu , and usurtu .28 In total, the following six expres- sions are used in Babylonian Entitlement monument inscriptions to denote the divine symbols: a/eširtu 'socle, pedestal, for divine symbol, image, in the form of a sanctuary'29 kakku 'weapon'30 mlnanzãzu 'socle', also 'station', and 'cosmic station'31 šubtu 'seat', 'socle', 'pedestal', 'shrine'32 šurínu/šunniru 'emblem' usurtu 'design, drawing, picture' Three of the six terms, a/eširtu , mlnanzãzu , and šubtu , circumscribe the meanings 'socle', 'pedestal', 'station', 'shrine', and 'seat'. Each expresses thus the physical locus of a divine symbol, or, in other contexts, the locus of a divine cult image. Of the remaining terms, kakku '(divine) weapon', denotes an object as- sociated with a god, that is, an implement or instru- ment wielded by a deity and employed to symbolize that god, such as the stylus for Nabû, or the lightning fork for Ninurta.

While usurtu seems to refer, straightforwardly enough, to the visual depiction of a divine symbol as it is carved upon the surface of the stone, the first five terms require further explication. a/esirtu , mlnanzãzu , and šubtu: 'Socle', 'Pedestal', 'Station', 'Seat', and 'Shrine' By pointing to its physical locus in a temple, it is by means of a figure of speech that the terms a/eširtu , m/nanzãzu , and šubtu designate a divine cult image or a divine symbol. Use of these terms to signify the symbols sculpted in relief implies that the representa- tions carved upon the stone are, in effect, visual meto- nyms signalling the presence of the divine. In the ancient Near East, an entity represented was strongly identified with its representation. This is perhaps most vividly illustrated by the effacement or destruction of visual representations, such as the faces of king Assurbanípal and his queen in the famous "Garden Scene" from the wall reliefs at Niniveh, delib- erately destroyed in the wake of the Median-Babyloni- an conquest of the Assyrian capital, or the fate of the Sargonic copper head, whose ears, nose, and eyes were evidently programmatically - almost ritualistically - mutilated.34 In Egypt, "the creative properties inherent in representation"35 provide the ideological foundation for tomb decoration depicting the eternal provisioning of the deceased, as well as the idealized visual repre- sentation of the deceased him- or herself and the means by which that individual could complete a successful transition to eternal life. In Mesopotamia, this phenom- enon underlies the nature of the cult offered to the divine cult image and the ritual processes by which it passed from the state of being an inanimate man-made artifact to a living manifestation of the divine that could then assume its central role in cultic activity. 33) Reschid and Wilcke suggested that šurínu/šunniru is a general term for all divine symbols, including those more specifically identified as šubtu , usurtu (and presumably also kakku ; Reschid and Wilcke, "Grenzstein" (1975): 62 (com- mentary to lines 77-79)). 34) C. Nylander, "Earless in Niniveh: Who Mutilated Sargon's Head?" AJA 84 (1980): 329-333; esp. pp. 330-331 and figures. Nylander presents a convincing case for the damage to both the head and the stone wall reliefs to have been programmatically mutilated in accordance with the prop- erties of representational images and messages of specific physical mutilations on the part of conquerors. 35) G.

Slanski The Mesopotamian cult image, Akkadian salmu , was a three-dimensional, anthropomorphic representa- tion of the god. According to late Babylonian and Assyrian texts that preserve the ritual we know as mis pi , 'Washing of the Mouth', the image was fashioned out of a wood core, overlaid with fine sheets of precious metal, and inset with precious and semi- precious stones. There are indications that the anthro- pomorphic image was introduced into Mesopotamian cult practice at the end of the third millennium and was the size of a human or even greater.36 The mis pí is a rite of passage for the image, enabling it to traverse from the realm of the profane to the realm of the sacred. The phrase mis pí itself refers to washing the mouth of the image, one step in the ritual whose performance effected the separation of the physical object from its mundane manufacture and animated its divine presence, enabling it to eat and drink, speak and hear, and take up residence in its sacred sanctuary. Having passed through this ritual process, the image became a manifestation of the deity it represented, one accessible to its earth-bound worshippers and capable of performing its cultic functions. The presence of the cult image in the temple signal- led the presence of the god. The strength of this conviction is also evidenced by Mesopotamian re- sponses to the absence of the cult image. In stories about the disappearance and restoration of a cult image, the loss or theft of the image is typically portrayed as the god having left his sanctuary out of divine anger or dissatisfaction. This theology is illustrated by the nar- rative portion of Nabû-apla-iddina, BBSt 36, also known as The Sippar Šamaš Tablet , an Entitlement Monument (fig. 8) whose narrative section tells the tale of the loss and recovery of the cult image of the sun-god, Šamaš. Notable literary works with this theme in the theologi- cal background include the so-called Marduk Prophecy and Epic of Erra?1 36) See J. Renger, "Kultbild. A. Philologisch," RLA 6 (1980-1983): 307-314; and U. Seidl, "Kultbild. B. Archäolo- gisch." RLA 6 (1989-1983): 314-319.

Rome, Istituto di Studi del Vicino Oriente, Università di Roma, 1969) can be found While divine symbols and divine cult images are both representations of the gods, they are representa- tions on a very different order.38 Nonetheless, the symbol is a representation of the divine, and does signal, if not the god in his anthropomorphic eating/ drinking/listening/speaking persona, some aspect of his power, strength, and character. Within this larger cultural framework, the signifi- cance of an Entitlement Monument invoking the locus of a divine symbol through representation of its socle, pedestal, shrine, or station, cannot be underestimated: through verbal and/or visual representation of the locus of the deity's representation, the presence of the mani- festation of the deity itself was invoked. Standing alone, this conclusion is neither great nor surprising. As the primary aim of the monuments under discussion was to commemorate acquisition of and protect claim to an entitlement, invocation of the divine presence would seem to be a natural and logical step. Moreover, the often elaborate series of divine curses, combined with the setting of the artifacts, which, according to their own inscriptions, were placed in the presence of the gods, that is, in the temple,39 make clear the intent of their makers to place the monuments as well as the entitlement so commemorated under divine protection. This conclusion does lead, however, to question of the nature of that divine protection.

It occurs as such in secular as well as sacred contexts; kakkï epěšum , for example, is an Old Babylonian idiom meaning 'to fight, to do battle, make war'. In extispicy texts, kakku denotes a 'mark' or 'sign' observed within the exta of the sacri- ficed animal,40 a portent that must be interpreted in its own turn by a highly trained specialist, the barů , 'seer', or 'divination priest'. The kakku- mark on the liver is - unsurprisingly - often to be associated with battle or warfare.41 The kakku (, ša ) ili 'weapon of a god' is a multivalent term that must be interpreted according to context. Metaphorically, kakku is used as an expression for military might and aggressiveness;42 the 'weapon of a god' in such a context refers to the might of that god brought to bear in battle.43 Literally, a 'weapon of a god' can also denote a tangible and - in contradistinction to the divine cult image - non- anthropomorphic object that was situated in the temple and symbolized the given god. The word kakku in these contexts has been rendered with the English equivalents 'symbol', 'standard', 'emblem', and even 'weapon-symbol'.44 In Babylonian culture, these physi- cal symbols of the gods are known to have played a prominent role in resolving legal disputes; in Assyrian culture, as argued by Dalley45 and Holloway,46 the divine kakku symbols may have figured prominently in the swearing of loyalty oaths of the so-called vassal treaties from the first millennium. Finally, as demon- strated above with regard to the Babylonian Entitle- ment Monuments, Akkadian kakku denotes the repre- sentation of a divine symbol carved upon the surface of the stone monument.47 Whatever the context, be it literary, divinatory, legal, or monumental, as a 'sign' or 'symbol' of a given god, the designation kakku must also carry with it the connotation 'weapon', signalling thereby the power and might at the disposal of that god. The case of the Storm-god, Adad (Iškur), whose kakku 'weapon' is the lightning fork, can serve as a particularly apt illustration. Heavily loaded as a substitute for the god, lightning is carried by Adad at his side and is the weapon he uses to strike down an adversary or other target of his divine anger (e. g., fig. 5). The lightning fork as independent symbol of Adad can be seen in figures 1- 2, 4, and 6. It is in legal con- texts that a specializ- ed role of the surlnu! šunniru 'emblem' in- tersects with that of the kakku 'weapon.' Divine weapons and emblems play a u- nique and crucial role in Old Babylonian ju- ridical process. When the evidence did not provide for a clear de- cision, judges sitting to hear a case could require litigants and/ or witnesses to take an exculpatory or de- claratory oath in or- Figure 5.

Written records indicate that the judges sent the parties to the temple, where the oath-taker would physically withdraw or remove (nasãhum) the divine 'weapon' or 'emblem' from its socle or pedestal or stand, and simultaneously pro- nounce the oath. The following passages, taken from Old Babylonian records, illustrate the use of divine symbols by the court:48 mdEN.ZU -ub-lam DUMU mdEN.ZU-Ha-s/r a-na ni-iš DINGIR a-na ŠU.NIR ša dUTU na-sa-hi id-di-nu-šu-ma Una KA dNun-gal 40) See CAD K, s. v. kakku 5; as well as, among other literature, the recent excellent study of U.

Similarly in another royal letter, and especially noteworthy in the larger socio-economic context of property and permanent entitlements, the divine weap- on was used to resolve the status of a field in dispute, notably a field whose status as property in perpetuity was at issue: šum-ma ar-ka-at A.ŠA-im šu-a-ti la ip-pa-ri-is mdUTU -ha-zi-ir A&amp;A-am šu-a-ti la ú-bi-ir-ma a-na I-bi-ú IŠKUR la id-di-in GIŠ.TUKUL ša DINGIR a-na A .ŠÁ-wn li-ri-id-ma at-tu-nu a-lum ú-ši-bu-tum a-wa-a-tim ša A.ŠA-im šu-a-ti ma-har DINGIR bi-ir-ra-ma A.ŠA-am a-na du-ri-šu [icP-na 60 If the circumstances of the aforementioned field were not (yet) investigated, (if) Šamaš-hazir did not (yet) establish (the status of) that field nor give it to Ibbi-Adad, let the weapon of the god go down to the field so that you (pl.), the city, and the witnesses may establish the circumstances of that field before the god, and give the field as his permanent property. In these ways, the measuring of grain or a field in the presence of the divine weapon was guaranteed to be accurate. Similarly, when evidence did not lead to a clear judgement, the court could order an oath to be taken by the divine weapon or emblem, with the underlying assumption that no person would swear a false oath and risk bringing down upon himself the curse of the gods. In both situations, in the absence of evidence sufficiently compelling to determine the case, use of the divine weapon was a tool at the disposal of the judges to enable them to determine the truth. The textual evidence cited here all stems from the Old Babylonian Period, a time much more richly docu- mented than the years in which the Entitlement Monu- ments were composed and erected. Nonetheless, the juridical practice of sending litigants to take the excul- patory oath is also evidenced in Middle Babylonian sources.61 60) TCL VII 40 (.

Slanski Taken all together, then, use of the divine symbol enables the court or other official to determine the true circumstances of a situation in question or dispute in order to make a decision that is accurate, truthful, and just. A context of judgement is also implied by many of the curses that are found in the Entitlement monu- ment inscriptions. Recall that in the Nazi-Maruttaš text cited above (Text A), the "17 divine emblems of the great gods" are called upon to serve as běl dabãbi , the 'adversary (in court)', of anyone who presumably would take legal measures to deprive the entitlement recipient of his claim. Throughout the corpus, the sun-god, Šamaš, and to a lesser extent the storm- or weather- god, Adad (Iškur), are frequently referred to with the epithet 'judge' and are called upon to render devastat- ing decisions for the potential violator of the entitle- ment.62 In two inscriptions,63 Šamaš is invoked to serve as diqugallu the 'Oberrichter' or 'chief justice'64 in the judgement of the would-be transgressor. Finally, there are numerous more oblique references to court process throughout the inscriptions. In the prohibitions, for example, persons are regularly warned not to bring legal action against the entitlement by 'contesting' or 'making a claim'65 or 'causing someone else to make a claim', or by 'claiming that "the field was not given/ sold."'66 Our understanding of legal judgements in Mesopo- tamia is that once they were passed, they were legally binding - that once a decision was made, it was impossible to alter. One can recall, for example, claus- es closing contracts and judgements that prohibit the School of Archaeology in Iraq, 1983); Petschow, MB Rechts- urkunden 1, 2, 13; PBS VII/2 162; BE XIV 7; Brinkman, MSKH 9. 62) For a review of evidence for the weather god as judge (in both juridical and divinatory contexts), see D.

The irrevocability lent by participation of the divine 'weapons' or 'emblems' in the decision making is consistent with Mesopotamian theology concerning decisions or commands issued by the gods: once made, such pronouncements cannot be revoked or changed. The divine epithet, DN, "whose commands cannot be altered, whose decisions cannot be changed," is pre- dominantly associated with the god Enlil, traditionally the most powerful god of the Babylonian pantheon. It is also applied to a god who has assumed a role of supremacy among his divine brethren, as is illustrated dramatically, for example, in the Enüma eliš , possibly composed during the second half of the 2nd millenni- um. When Tiamat bestows upon Kingu supreme divine power, the power to "render irrevocable decisions," she appoints him leader of her ghastly forces and gives him the Tablet of Destinies, saying "As for you, your command will not be changed, your utterance will be eternal."68 Later in the poem, Marduk demands the same supreme power from the assembled Igigi-gods as compensation for assuming for them the role of cham- pion: "If indeed I am to champion you, "Subdue Tiamat and save your lives, "Convene the assembly, nominate me for supreme destiny! "Take your places in the Assembly Place of the Gods, all of you, in a joyful mood. "When I speak, let me ordain destinies instead of you. "Let nothing that I shall bring about be altered, "Nor what I say be revoked or changed."69 Marduk' s new powers are subsequently tested when he successfully "commands" a constellation to disap- pear and then reappear, and only then do the gods 67) From the edition of M.

It is the quality of permanence, of irrevocability, divinely sanctioned and enforced by the participation of the divine 'weapons' and 'emblems', that underlies the presence of the carved representations of divine symbols on the Babylonian Entitlement Monuments. Other Carved Representations of Divine Symbols The same quality of divinely enforced irrevocability may also be implied by similar representations of divine symbols carved on cylinder seals and on Neo- Assyrian Treary Stelae. Beginning in the late second millennium and con- tinuing at least through the Neo-Baby Ionian era, scenes are carved on cylinder seals depicting a human figure in the presence of divine symbols, some of which are represented mounted on bases or pedestals (e. g., figs. 6-7). These representations resemble quite strongly the depictions of divine symbols sculpted upon bases upon the Babylonian Entitlement Monuments. They also evoke visually the performance described verbally in Old Babylonian legal sources of 'drawing' or 'pulling out' a divine weapon or emblem in the course of swearing an exculpatory oath. The legal significance of sealing tablets in Mesopo- tamia is germane to this discussion. The party applying the seal certifies his "undertak(ing) of a specific obli- gation in a given transaction."70 A scene depicting the image of the owner of the seal in the presence of divine Figure 6.

I use here the term image, Akkadian salmu , quite deliberately. In Mesopotamia, the carved, free-standing image (Akkadian salmu, Sumerian ALAN) of a god or king was considered a manifestation of that god or king.71 Images of the gods undergo rituals of separation (from their human manufacture) and animation, after which they take up residence in temples as manifestations of the gods they represent. Human and divine figures carved in relief upon stelae do not seem to undergo such rites de passage. Nor do they play the same kind of active and dynamic role as do the divine cult images - receiving cult, for example, and mediating between the divine and human realms. Nonetheless, in the case of the Hammurapi Law Stele as well as on the Entitlement Monuments, relief sculptures of human and divine figures are also designated salmu 'image'.72 In a cognitive process suggested by the reception of divine cult images, these 7l) A deft discussion of the nature of that manifestation and the relationship between the representation of the god and the god is T.

Slanski salmu 'images' carved in relief would be regarded as manifestations of the entities so represented. It has been suggested that these sculpted relief representa- tions, like the divine cult images, are endowed with a performative quality when viewed by their audience.73 It must be noted that in the Babylonian Entitlement Monument inscriptions, sculpted representations of the divine symbols are not designated with the term salmu. This observation suggests the possibility that the term salmu tends to be reserved for representations of gods and of humans, that is, anthropomorphic representa- tions.74 On a clay tablet then, the image of the owner of the seal depicted in the raised impression of a cylinder seal, carved intaglio , might also be viewed as a salmu. The impressed scene might thereby also be imbued with a performative quality, which would be in keep- ing with the function of a seal impression: to certify the owner's participation in the transaction recorded on the tablet so sealed. The anthropomorphic, three-di- mensional representation of the seal's owner, created by the raised clay impression, would thus signal the participatory presence of the owner of the seal. And, in scenes depicting the owner of the seal in the presence of divine symbols, such an image would signal that the both Entitlement Monuments and seals, the inter-re- lated messages of divinely sanctioned solemnity and divinely enforced irrevocability as signalled by the representations of divine symbols would have served to re-enforce one another in their respective media. It is, of course, the weapon and/or emblem of Šamaš, the god most closely associated with justice and judge- ment, that is most frequently invoked in legal texts to ensure discovery of the true situation, and it is his symbol, the sun disk, that appears without fail upon every single member of the Entitlement Monument corpus. In particular, we should note in this context the relief scene of the Entitlement Monument Adad-apla- iddina BBSt 36, the Sippar Šamaš Tablet. Here, the narrative section of the inscription details the loss and replacement of the cult image, salmu , of Šamaš, for which the king rewards with a rich prebend the priest who oversaw the image's restoration. The plaque- shaped monument is carved with a raised relief depic- ting the recipient of the entitlement actually grasping the stand76 that supports a sun-disk, emblem of Šamaš (fig. 8). The gesture itself remains open to interpreta- tion; I have suggested elsewhere that the priest, leading his king into the presence of Šamaš, is depicted as guiding the sun-disc either into or out of its place seal's owner was divinely as well as legally bound to maintain his obligation. Although their repertories of specific sym- bols overlap only slightly, seals carved with scenes depicting a human figure together with divine symbols were in circulation during the time of the Entitlement Monuments.75 For 73) For the ffammurapi Law Stele &gt; see Winter, "Art in Empire" (1997): 366-367, followed by Slanski, Babylonian Entitlement Monuments 2003, pp. 259-266; also pp. 255-258. 74) The topic çalmu image in Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East is highly complex and merits intensive study.

Figure Figure If anthropomorphic representation is borne out Boudc Boudary as a characteristic of an image designated salmu , there are implications for the reading of Gen 1 : 26 and 27. It is tempting in this context to see in the Biblical text a deliberate play on the Mesopotamian practice of creating divine representations in the anthropomorphic image of man, as opposed to the Genesis narrative, whereby mankind has been created in the image ( beselem ) of God. 75) See, for examples, D.

The point of the observation is that while touching the anthropomorphic cult image was likely prohibited, this scene does depict one of the key parties concerned with the entitlement physically grasping the stand upon which a divine symbol rests.78 The quality of irrevocability lent by invocation of the divine weapon/emblem may also underlie the ap- pearance of divine symbols upon Assyrian monuments. As noted above, Dalley,79 followed by Holloway,80 have already argued persuasively that the role of the symbols carved in relief upon Assyrian stelae may represent the presence of the actual divine weapons/ emblems at the execution of the loyalty treaty. Their presence at the moment of execution of the treaty, and as viewed subsequently on the commemorative stelae, would have served to re-enforce the divinely binding nature of loyalty oaths sworn to by the Assyrian vassal states. Cultural and Social Context of the Divine Symbols In closing, a passage from the inscription of the Caillou Michaux , a tenth century Entitlement Monu- ment (fig. 1), can now be more fully understood within its greater cultural and social - specifically, legal, theological, and representational - contexts: 20 ŠE.NUMUN 1 IKU BANEŠ 1 KÚŠ GAL -tu A.GÀR URU Kar-d AG GÚ ÍD A.MEŠ-KAL-KAL i-na É-mHab-ban A.ŠÁ mu-li-gi ... mdMUŠ-URÚ DUMU mHab-ban a-[na^ ,rURU'BÀD-LUGAL-GI.NA-a-a-/-^ DUMU.SAL-™ É.GI4.A mDÙG.GA-a-iaò-dAMAR.UTU DUMU mI-na É-SAG-ÍL-NUMUN lùSUKKAL a-na UD-ww sa-a-ti SUM ù DÙG.GA-tf-.sYzò-dAMAR-UTU DUMU m/-tftf-É-SAG-ÍL-NUMUN ,ÙSUKAL a-na paq-ri la ra-še-e ni-iš DINGIR.MEŠ GAL.MEŠ ù dMUŠ i-na nil4NA.RÚ.A šu-a-tuA 4 iz-kur 4 7?)

The penultimate lines preceding the performance of the oath are ambiguous; a possible alternate reading is "so as to preclude the raising of claims, an oath by the great gods and Nirah on this very narû he swore:" indicating thereby that the oath taken was sworn by the gods (represented) upon the stone monument. The precise reading of the lines does not really matter - the stone Entitlement Monument bearing sculpted repre- sentations of divine symbols played a central role in the swearing of an oath intended to protect the entitle- ment from claims potentially posed by the father-in- law of the woman acquiring the entitlement. The function of the divine symbols carved in relief upon the Babylonian Entitlement Monuments was to protect the entitlement as well as the monument com- memorating that entitlement from attempted violations. Anticipated transgressions included legal challenges to the entitlement, and the language of the Imprecative division of the inscriptions alludes regularly to a legal or juridical context. The carved symbols themselves represent not simply the gods but specifically the symbols of the gods that stood in Mesopotamian temples and served a specific function in the determination of truth and justice and the enforcement of binding judge- ments. The visual representations of such symbols, sculpted upon the Babylonian Entitlement Monuments, as well as upon cylinder seals carved in the late second through first millennia and upon Neo-Assyrian Treaty Stelae, ratified the divinely sanctioned and divinely enforced binding and irrevocable character of the terms set forth in the accompanying inscriptions. 81 ) Marduk-nadin-ahhe (1099-1082), known as the " Cail- lou Michaux ;" i 1 - ii 1 .</page></plain_text>
