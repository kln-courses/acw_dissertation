Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013. 289 pages. ISBN: 978-0-19-957871-9 (hardcover). Description: "America Bewitched is the first major his- tory of witchcraft in America - from the Salem witch tri- als of 1692 to the present day. The infamous Salem trials are etched into the con- sciousness of modern America, the human toll a reminder of the dangers of intolerance and persecution. The re- frain 'Remember Salem!' was invoked frequently over the ensuing centuries. As time passed, the trials became a milepost measuring the distance America had progressed from its colonial past, its victims now the righteous and their persecutors the shamed. Yet the story of witchcraft did not end as the American Enlightenment dawned - a new, long, and chilling chapter was about to begin. Witchcraft after Salem was not just a story of fireside tales, legends, and superstitions; it continued to be a mat- ter of life and death, souring the American dream for many. We know of more people killed as witches between 1692 and the 1950s than were executed before it. Witches were part of the story of the decimation of the Native Americans, the experience of slavery and emancipation, and the immigrant experience; they were embedded in the religious and social history of the country. Yet the his- tory of American witchcraft between the eighteenth and the twentieth century also tells a less traumatic story, one that shows how different cultures interacted and shaped each other's languages and beliefs. This is therefore much more than the tale of one per- secuted community: it opens a fascinating window on the fears, prejudices, hopes, and dreams of the American peo- ple as their country rose from colony to superpower." Anthropology: A Continental Perspective. Christoph Wulf. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2013. 408 pages. ISBN: 978- 0-226-92506-6 (cloth); ISBN: 978-0-226-92507-3 (paperback); ISBN: 978-0-226-92508- 0 (e-book). Description: "Originally published in German, Christoph Wulf's Anthropology sets its sights on a topic as ambitious as its title suggests: anthropology itself. Ar- guing for an interdisciplinary and intercultural approach to anthropology that incorporates science, philosophy, history, and many other disciplines, Wulf examines - with breathtaking scope - all the ways that anthropology has been understood and practices through the years around the globe. Seeking a central way to understand anthropology in the midst of many different approaches to the discipline, Wulf concentrates on the human body. An emblem of so- ciety, culture, and time, the body is also the result of many mimetic processes - the active acquisition of cultural knowledge. By examining the role of the body in the per- formance of rituals, gestures, language, and other forms of imagination, he offers a bold new look at how culture is produced, handed down, and transformed." Apocalypse and the Millennium in the American Civil War Era. Ben Wright and Zachary W. Dresser, eds., forward by Mark A. Noll. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2013. 255 pages. ISBN: 978-0-8071-5192-1 (hard- cover); ISBN: 978-0-8071-5193-8 (pdf); ISBN: 978-0-8071-5194-5 (epub); 978-0-8071-5195-2 (mobi). Description: "In the Civil War era, Americans nearly unanimously accepted that humans battled in a cosmic contest between good and evil and that God was direct- ing history toward its end. The concept of God's Provi- dence and of millennialism - Christian anticipations of the end of the world - dominated religious thought in the nineteenth century. During the tumultuous years imme- diately prior to, during, and after the war, these ideas took on a greater importance as Americans struggled with the unprecedented destruction and promise of the period. Scholars of religion, literary critics, and especially his- torians have acknowledged the presence of apocalyptic thought in the era, but until now, few studies have taken the topic as their central focus or examined it from the an- tebellum period through Reconstruction. By doing so, the essays in Apocalypse and the Millennium in the American Civil War Era highlight the diverse ways in which beliefs about the end times influenced nineteenth-century Amer- ican lives, including reform culture, the search for mean- ing amid the trials of war, and the social transformation</page><page sequence="2">1 06 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 28 (1 ) 201 4 wrought by emancipation. Millennial zeal infused the labor of reformers and explained their successes and failures as progress toward an imminent Kingdom of God. Men and women in the North and South looked to Providence to explain the causes and consequences of both victory and defeat, and Americans, black and white, experienced the shock waves of emancipation as either a long-prophesied jubilee or a vengeful punishment. Religion fostered divi- sion as well as union, the essays suggest, but while the na- tion tore itself apart and tentatively stitched itself back to- gether, Americans continued looking to divine intervention to make meaning of the national apocalypse." Being Human, Being Migrant: Senses of Self and Well-Being. Anne Sigrid Gronseth, ed. New York and London: Berghahn Books, 2013. 176 pages. ISBN: 978-1-78238-045-0 (hardback); ISBN: 978-1-78238-046-7 (institutional ebook). Description: "Migrant experiences accentuate general aspects of the human condition. Therefore, this volume explores migrants' movements not only as geographical movements from here to there but also as movements that constitute an embodied, cognitive and existential experi- ence of living 'in between' or on the borderlands' between differently figured life-worlds. Focusing on memories, nostalgia, the here-and-now social experiences of daily living and the hopes and dreams for the future, the vol- ume demonstrates how all interact in migrants' and refugees' experience of identity and quest for well-being." Colonial Collecting and Display: Encounters with Material Culture from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Clarie Wintle. New York and Oxford: Berhghan Books, 2013. 244 pages. ISBN: 978-0-85745-941-1 (hardback); ISBN: 978- 0-85745-942-8 (ebook). Description: "In the late nineteenth century, British trav- ellers to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands compiled wide- ranging collections of material culture for scientific in- struction and personal satisfaction. Colonial Collecting and Display follows the compelling history of a particular set of such objects, tracing their physical and conceptual trans- formation from object of indigenous use to accessioned objects in a museum collection in the south of England. This first study dedicated to the historical collecting and display of the Islands' material cultures develops a new analysis of colonial discourse, using a material cul- ture-led approach to reconceptualize imperial relation- ships between Andamanese, Nicobarese and British com- munities, both in the Bay of Bengal and on British soil. It critiques established conceptions of the act of collect- ing, arguing for recognition of how indigenous makers and consumers impacted upon 'British' collection prac- tices, and querying the notion of a homogeneous British approach to material culture from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands." The Cooking of History: How Not to Study Afro-Cuban Religion. Stephan Palmié. Chicago and London: The Uni- versity of Chicago Press, 2013. 360 pages. ISBN: 978-0-226-01942-0 (cloth); ISBN: 978-0-226-01956-7 (paper); ISBN: 978-0-226-01973-4 (e-book). Description: "In The Cooking of History&gt; Stephan Palmié provides a comprehensive analysis of the as- sumptions underlying the very term 'Afro-Cuban religion.' He shows how anthropologists, by relying on the notion of a hypothetical African past - and by authenticating religions via their own findings - have exerted consider- able influence upon contemporary practices. Critiquing widespread and damaging simplifications that posit reli- gious practices as stable and self-contained, Palmié calls for a drastic new approach that properly situates cultural origins within the complex social environments and schol- arly fields in which they are investigated." The Craft of Ritual Studies. Ronald L. Grimes. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. 414 pages. ISBN: 978-0-19-530142 -7 (hardback); ISBN: 978-0-19-530143-4 (paperback). Description: "In Religious Studies, theory and method research has long been embroiled in a polarized debate over scientific versus theological perspectives. Ronald L. Grimes shows that this debate has stagnated, due in part to a man- ner of theorizing too far removed from the study of actual religious practices. A worthwhile theory, according to Grimes, must be practice-oriented, and practices are most effectively studied by field research methods. The Craft of Ritual Studies melds together a systematic theory and method capable of underwriting the cross-</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 28 (1 ) 201 4 1 07 cultural, interdisciplinary study of ritual. Grimes exposes the limitations that disable many theories of ritual - for example, defining ritual as essentially religious, assum- ing that ritual's only function is to generate group soli- darity, or treating ritual as a mirror of the status quo. He provides a guide for fieldwork on complex ritual events, particularly those characterized by social conflict or cul- tural creativity. The volume includes a case study, focus- ing on a single complex event: the Santa Fe Fiesta, a New Mexico celebration marked by protracted ethnic conflict and ongoing dramatic creativity. Grimes develops such themes as the relation of ritual to media, theater, and film, the dynamics of ritual creativity, the negotiation of rit- ual criticism, and the impact of ritual on cultural and physical environments. This important book, the capstone work of Grimes's three decades of leadership in the field of ritual studies, is accompanied by a set of online videos, as well as ap- pendices illustrating key aspects of ritual studies." Écrits d'Amazonie: Cosmologies, rituels, guerre et chamanisme. Alfred Métraux. Paris: CNRS Éditions, 2013. 526 pages. ISBN: 978-2-271-07674-8 (paperbk). Description: "Connu pour ses ouvrages sur l'île de Pâques et le culte vaudou, Alfred Métraux (1902-1963) est une des grandes figures de l'ethnologie française, et un personnage inclassable. Chartiste, ami de Georges Bataille et de Michel Leiris, responsable à l'UNESCO de programmes, partagé entre l'Amérique du Sud où il a passé son enfance, la France où il a étudie, l'Amérique où il a enseigné et travaillé au Handbook of South American IndianSy il a construit un oeuvre multiple, prodigieuse- ment documentée, rigoureuse et nourrie, écrit Lévi- Strauss, de «la richesse d'une expérience telle qu'aucun ethnologue n'en a probablement possédé de semblable». La sélection, inédite en français ou inaccessible au- jourd'hui, de ses travaux et de ses synthèses, met ici en valeur ses recherches américanistes sur les Indiens d'A- mazonie et du Chaco. Le lecteur y trouvera ses contribu- tions les plus novatrices: ses synthèses sur les cosmolo- gies, les rituels et les systèmes chamaniques des Indiens des basses terres mais aussi sa défense de la civilisation des autochtones amérindiens. Une oeuvre d'une rare fécondité intellectuelle à redé- couvrir." Feeding the Dead: Ancestor Worship in Ancient India. Matthew R. Sayers. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2013. 187 pages. ISBN: 978-0-19-989643-1 (paperback); ISBN: 978-0-19-991747-1. Description: " Feeding the Dead outlines the history of ancestor worship in South Asia from the earliest sources available, the Vedas, up to the descriptions found in the Dharmashastra tradition. Most works on ancestor wor- ship have done little to address the question of how shrad- dha, the paradigmatic ritual of ancestor worship up to the present day, came to be. Matthew R. Sayers argues that the development of shraddha is key to understanding the shift from Vedic to Classical Hindu modes of religious behav- ior. Central to this transition is the discursive construction of the role of the religious expert in mediating between the divine and the human actor. Sayers argues that the defi- nition of a religious expert that informs religiosity in the Common Era is grounded in the redefinition of ancestral rites in the Grihyasutras. Beyond clarifying the much mis- understood history of ancestor worship in India, this book addresses the questions of how and why religion in India changed so radically in the last half of the first millennium BCE. The redefinition of the role of religious expert is hugely significant for understanding that change." Fire in the Canyon: Religion, Migration, and the Mexican Dream. Leah Sarat. New York and London: New York Uni- versity Press, 2013. 241 pages. ISBN: 978-0-8147-5937-0 (cloth); ISBN: 978-1-5836-7315-7 (paper). Description: "The canyon in central Mexico was ablaze with torches as hundreds of people filed in. So palpable was their shared shock and grief, they later said, that nei- ther pastor nor priest was needed. The event was a me- morial service for one of their own who had died during an attempted border passage. Months later a survivor emerged from a coma to tell his story. The accident had prompted his conversion to Pentecostalism. Today, over half of the local residents of El Alberto, a town in central Mexico, are evangelical Protestants. Call- ing upon the protection of a God for whom there are no borders, they embrace migration as their right while also</page><page sequence="4">1 08 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 28 (1 ) 201 4 pursuing their community s 'Mexican Dream' - the dream of a Mexican future with ample employment for all. Every week, they help stage a border crossing simulation that places tourists in the shoes of an undocumented immi- grant for a night. Fire in the Canyon provides one of the first in-depth looks at the dynamic relationship between religion, mi- gration, and ethnicity across the U.S.-Mexican border. Faced with the choice between life-threatening danger at the border and life-sapping unemployment in Mexico, residents of El Alberto are drawing on both their religious practices and their indigenous heritage to claim not only the right to migrate, but also the right to stay home. If we wish to understand people's migration decision, Sarat argues, we must take religion seriously. It is through re- ligion that people formulate their ideas about life, death, and the limits of government authority." The Formation of Candomblé: Vodun History and Ritual in Brazil. Luis Nicolau Parés, transi, by Richard Vernon. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2013. 398 pages. ISBN: 978-0-8078-3311-7 (cloth); ISBN: 978- 1-4696-1092-4 (paper). Description: "Interweaving three centuries of transat- lantic religious and social history with historical and pres- ent-day ethnography, Luis Nicolau Parés traces the for- mation of Candomblé, one of the most influential African-derived religious forms in the African diaspora, with practitioners today centered in Brazil and not avail- able in English until now, The Formation of Candomblé reveals cultural changes that have occurred in religious practices within Africa, as well as those caused by the dis- placement of enslaved Africans in the Americas. Departing from the common assumption that Can- domblé originated in the Yoruba orixá (orisha) worship, Parés highlights the critical role of the vodun religious practices in its formation process. Vodun traditions were brought by enslaved Africans of Dahomean origin, known as the "Jeje" nation in Brazil since the early eighteenth century. The book concludes with Parés's account of pres- ent-day Jeje temples in Bahia, which serves as the first written record of the oral traditions and ritual of this par- ticular nation of Candomblé." From Beasts to Souls: Gender and Embodiment in Medieval Europe. E. Jane Burns and Peggy McCracken, eds. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 2013. 269 pages. ISBN-13: 978-0-268-02232-7; ISBN-10: 0-268- 02232-1 (paperback). Description: "This volume asks how medieval cultural representations of nonhuman or partially human crea- tures, whether literary, visual, religious, or theological, give us new ways to think about gender and embodiment on a broad theoretical spectrum. Contributors explore that question in a range of medieval contexts extending from learned debates to everyday objects of popular cul- ture. Their essays draw on depictions of differently bod- ied creatures in the Middle Ages to dislodge and recon- figure long-standing views of the body as always human and the human body as merely male or female." Genetic Disorders and Islamic Identity Among British Bangladeshis. Santi Rozario. Durham, NC: Carolina Academic Press, 2013. 249 pages. ISBN: 978-1-59460-968-8 (paperback). Description: "This book is a study of British Bangladeshi Muslim families with genetic disorders. A major focus of the research is on how British Bangladeshi culture and Islam affect the families' experience of genetic illness. Two key issues shape their attitudes: the continuity of Bangladeshi kin networks, with their entrenched values regarding women, gender and hereditary illness, and the place of Islam and of Muslim identity in a British society increasingly hostile to Muslims and polarised around ques- tions of religion. The families' wider kin networks, both within and beyond the UK, have a critical impact on the options available to them. The extended family may pro- vide support, but it can also stigmatise and allocate blame. Islam encourages medical treatment. However, the fami- lies' views of legitimate medical options are framed by the growing 'Islamophobia' of British society, including moral panics about 'cousin marriage' among Muslims, and the growth among the British Muslims themselves of new, more restrictive styles of Islam. In practice, the politics of Muslim identity in contemporary Britain often restricts the options for medical intervention. Rozario's study also illuminates the complex interac- tions between medical professionals and ethnic minori- ties. Affected families may have good reasons to make choices other than those medical professionals would wish. For the families, the risk to reputation, status and hon-</page><page sequence="5">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 28 (1 ) 201 4 1 09 our if others know that there is a fault or problem in the family's "blood" ( rakter dosh) may be more important than the risk of having an affected child. Rakter dosh has moral implications for the members for the members of the extended family, and can damage the marriage prospects of unmarried children, whether or not they are personally affected by genetic illness. As this book shows, genetic illness is a social issue as well as a medical prob- lem. The research in this book should be of use to med- ical professionals dealing with ethnic minority families as well as providing an incisive and revealing study for med- ical anthropologists." Indigenous Religion and Cultural Performance in the New Maya World. Garrett W. Cook and Thomas A. Offit, eds., with a contribution from Rhonda Taube. Albuquerque: The University of New Mexico Press, 2013. 200 pages. ISBN: 978-0-8263-5318-4 (cloth); ISBN: 978-0-8263-5319-1 (electronic). Description: "Based on more than thirty years of ethnographic fìeldwork in Highland Guatemala, this study of Maya diviners, shamans, ritual dancers, and religious brotherhoods describes the radical changes in traditional Maya religious practice wrought by economic globaliza- tion and political turmoil. Focusing on the primary par- ticipants in the annual festival in the K'iche' Maya village of Santiago Momostenango, the authors show how older religious traditionalists and the new generation of 'cul- tural activist' religious practitioners interact within a sin- gle local community, and how their competing agendas for adapting Maya religiosity to a new and continually changing political economy are perpetuating and chang- ing Maya religious traditions. Seeking to refine current understanding of indigenous religion in Guatemala and to develop predictions for what the future will hold, Cook, Offit, and Taube document the transformations that fiesta practices have undergone and the prospects for conflict and cooperation in the fu- ture between the practitioners of Costumbre and their cultural activist neighbors in Momostenango, and by ex- trapolation, throughout the entire Maya region." Lessons in Courage: Peruvian Shamanic Wisdom for Everyday Life. Bonnie Glass-Coffin, Ph.D. and don Oscar Miro- Quesada. Rainbow Ridge Books, 2013. 134 pages. ISBN: 978-1-937907-18-1 (paperback). Description: "Buckminster Fuller reminds us, 'You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the old model obsolete.' This book provides that new model for living, based on ancient wisdoms and the cycles and pulses of the natural world. It deeply grounds the reader in a 'this world' spirituality that blends indigenous cosmolo- gies, earth-honoring ritual, and time-tested practices for daily living that heal and transform us. This is the wisdom gleaned from the experience of one soul awakened to his destiny as an instrument of love and healing in the world. It is a story full of cosmic 'inter- ventions' and deep synchronicity on a par with the spir- itual adepts and luminaries of the ages; yet it is a journey toward wholeness that we all share." Looking for Mary Magdalene: Alternative Pilgrimage and Ritual Creativity at Catholic Shrines in France. Anna Fedele. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2013. 320 pages. ISBN: 978-0-19-989840-4 (hardcover); ISBN: 978- 0-19-989842-8 (paperback). Description: "Anna Fedele offers a sensitive ethnogra- phy of alternative pilgrimages to French Catholic shrines dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene. Drawing on more than three years of fieldwork, she describes how pilgrims from Italy, Spain, Britain, and the United States interpret Catholic figures, symbols, and sites according to theories derived from the international Neopagan movement. Fedele pays particular attention to the pilgrims' life sto- ries, rituals and reading. She examines how they devise their rituals, how anthropological literature has influ- enced them, and why this kind of spirituality is increas- ingly prevalent in the West. These pilgrims cultivate spir- ituality in interaction with each other and with textual sources: Jungian psychology, Goddess mythology, and "indigenous" traditions merge into a corpus of practices centered upon the worship of the Goddess and Mother Earth, and the sacralization of the reproductive cycle. Their rituals present a critique of Roman Catholicism and the medical establishment, and question contemporary discourse on gender."</page><page sequence="6">1 1 0 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 28 (1 ) 201 4 Mysteries of the Jaguar Shamans of the Northwest Amazon. Robin M. Wright. Lincoln and London: University of Nebraska Press, 2013. 387 pages. ISBN: 978-0-8032-4394-1 (cloth). Description: "Mysteries of the Jaguar Shamans of the Northwest Amazon tells the life story of Mandu da Silva, the last living jaguar shaman among the Baniwa people in the northwest Amazon. In this original and engaging work, Robin M. Wright, who has known and worked with da Silva for more than thirty years, weaves the story of da Silva's life together with the Baniwas' society, his- tory, mythology, cosmology, and jaguar shaman tradi- tions. The jaguar shamans are key players in what Wright calls 'a nexus of religious power and knowledge' in which healers, sorcerers, priestly chanters, and dance-leaders exercise complementary functions that link living spe- cialists with the deities and great spirits of the cosmos. By exploring in depth the apprenticeship of the shaman, Wright shows how jaguar shamans acquire the knowl- edge and power of the deities in several stages of in- struction and practice. This volume is the first mapping of the sacred geog- raphy Omythscape') of the Northern Arawak-speaking people of the northwest Amazon, demonstrating direct connections between petroglyphs and other inscriptions and Baniwa sacred narratives as a whole. In eloquent and inviting analytic prose, Wright links biographic and ethno- graphic elements in elevating anthropological writing to a new standard of theoretically aware story- telling and analytic power." Narratives of Sorrow and Dignity: Japanese Women, Pregnancy Loss, and Modern Rituals of Grieving. Bardwell L. Smith. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2013. 410 pages. ISBN: 978-0-19-994213-8 (alk. paper); ISBN: 978-0-19-994215-2 (paperback); ISBN: 978-0-19-994214-5 (ebook). Description: "Bardwell L. Smith offers a fresh per- spective on tnizuko kuyo, the Japanese ceremony per- formed to bring solace to those who have experienced miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion. Showing how old and new forms of myth, symbol, doctrine, praxis, and or- ganization combine and overlap in contemporary tnizuko kuyoy Smith provides critical insight from many angles: the sociology of the family, the power of the medical pro- fession, the economics of temples, the import of ances- tral connections, the need for healing in both private and communal ways and, perhaps above all, the place of women in modern Japanese religion. At the heart of Smiths research is the issue of how human beings experience the death of a life that has been and remains precious to them. While universal, these losses are also personal and unique. The role of society in help- ing people to heal from these experiences varies widely and has changed enormously in recent decades. In exam- ples of grieving for these kinds of losses one finds narra- tives not only deep sorrow but of remarkable dignity." People Trees: Worship of Trees in Northern India. David L. Haberman. 387 pages. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2013. 387 pages. ISBN: 978-0-19-992916-0 (paperback). Description: "People Trees is about religious concep- tions of trees within the cultural world of tree worship at the tree shrines of northern India. Sacred trees have been worshiped for millennia in India, and today tree worship continues there in abundance among all segments of so- ciety. In the past, tree worship was regarded by many Western anthropologists and scholars of religion as a prime example of childish animism or primitive religion. More recently, this aspect of world religious cultures is almost completely ignored in the theoretical concerns of the day. Incorporating ethnographic fieldwork and text never before translated into English, Haberman reevaluates con- cepts such as animism, anthropomorphism, and person- hood in the context of the worship of the pipai, a tree of mighty and ambiguous power; the neem, an embodied form of a goddess whose presence is enhanced with col- orful ornamentation and a facemask appended to its trunk; and the banyan, a tree noted for its association with longevity and immortality. Along with detailed de- scriptions of a wide range of tree worship rituals, here is a spirited exploration of the practical consequences, per- ceptual possibilities, and implicit environmental ethics suggested by Indian notions about sacred trees." Pop Pagans: Paganism and Popular Music. Donna Weston and Andy Bennett, eds. Durham, UK: Acumen, 2013. 246 pages.

It has found of its most public expressions in popular music, where it is voiced by singers and musicians across rock, folk, techno, goth, metal, Celtic, world and pop music. With essays ranging across the US, UK, continental Europe, Australia and Asia, Pop Pagans assesses the histories, genres, per- formances and communities of Pagan popular music. Over time, Paganism became associated with the counter-culture, satanic and gothic culture, rave and fes- tival culture, ecological consciousness and spirituality, and new ageism. Paganism has used music to express a powerful and even transgressive force in everyday life. Pop Pagans examines the many artists and movements that have contributed to this growing phenomenon." Race and Immigration in the New Ireland. Julieann Veronica Ulin, Heather Edwards, and Sean O'Brian, eds. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 2013. 230 pages.

Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 2013. 278 pages. ISBN: 978-0-268-03325-5 (paperback). Description: "In this original study, William Kuskin asks us to reconsider the relationship between literary form and historical period. Kuskin suggests that moder- nity is far from a distinct historical category but is pro- foundly contingent on the Middle Ages. He sets out a compelling critique of the modernist literary-history par- adigm of linear chronology and rupture, and makes an engaging case for 'recursion' as a new principle by which literary historians can trace the presence of the 'old' and the 'new.' Books, for Kuskin, are recursive: they imagine within themselves a return to an earlier moment of writ- ing, which, when read, they enact in the present. Recur- sive Origins will be of interest to students and scholars of medieval or Renaissance literature, the history of the book, medieval-Renaissance periodization, and theories of lit- erary history." "Riten" beginnen bei "Essen und Trinken". Entwicklung und Bedeutung von Etikettevorschriften im Japan der Edo- Zeit am Beispiel der Tischsitten. Michael Kinski. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2013. 635 pages. ISBN: 978-3-447- 06887-1 (hardback). Ritualization and Human Interiority. Clemens Cavallin. University of Copenhagen, Denmark: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2013. 141 pages. ISBN: 978-87-635-3734-6 (paperback). Description: "The word ritual often evokes images of outward social performances, whether austere physical gestures or exuberant pageants of song and dance. In Rit- ualization and Human Interiority , Clemens Cavallin ex- amines the inward meaning of rituals, showing that rit- ual and many forms of interiorization are in fact interconnected processes providing ritual practices with a particular basic dynamism. Tying this notion into re- lated topics such as ritualization and modernity, Cavallin provides new insights into one of the human sciences' central questions: the relationship between external so- cial displays and internal personal acts." Shamanism and Violence: Power, Repression and Suffering in Indigenous Religious Conflicts. Diana Riboli and Da- vide Torri, eds. Surrey, UK: Ashgate, 2013. 176 pages. ISBN: 978-1-4094-4386-5 (hardback); ISBN: 978-1-4094-4387- 2 (ebk-PDF); ISBN: 978-1-4724-0229-5 (ebk-ePUB). Description: "Proposing a new theoretical framework, this book explores shamanism's links with violence from a global perspective. Contributors, renowned anthropol- ogists and authorities in the field, draw on their research in Mongolia, China, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, India, Siberia, America, Papua New Guinea and Taiwan to in- vestigate how indigenous shamanic cultures dealt, and are still dealing, with varying degrees of internal and ex- ternal violence. During ceremonies, shamans act like hunters and war- riors, dealing with many states related to violence, such as collective and individual suffering, attack, conflict and antagonism. Indigenous religious complexes are often called to respond to direct and indirect competition with</page><page sequence="8">1 1 2 JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 28 (1 ) 201 4 more established cultural and religious traditions which undermine the sociocultural structure, the sense of iden- tity and the state of well-being of many indigenous groups. This book explores a more sensitive vision of shamanism, closer to the ernie views of many indigenous groups." Sounding Out Heritage: Cultural Politics and the Social Practice of Quatt Ho Folk Song in Northern Vietnam. Lau- ren Meeker. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2013. 192 pages. ISBN: 978-0-8248-3568-2 (cloth). Description: "Sounding Out Heritage explores the cul- tural politics that have shaped the recent history and prac- tice of a unique style of folk song that originated in Bac Ninh province, northern Vietnam. The book delves into the rich and complicated history of quatt ho, showing the changes it has undergone over the last sixty years as it moved from village practice onto the professional stage. Interweaving an examination of folk music, cultural na- tionalism, and cultural heritage with an in-depth ethno- graphic account of the changing social practice of quatt ho folk song, author Lauren Meeker presents a vivid and historically contextualized picture of the ąuan ho 'sound- scape'. Village practitioners, ordinary people who love to sing quatt ho, must now negotiate increased attention from those outside the village and their own designation as 'living treasures.' Professional singers, with their dif- ferent performance styles and representational practices, have been incorporated into the quan ho soundscape in an effort to highlight and popularize the culture of Bac Ninh province in the national context. With its focus on the politics of rescuing, preserving, and performing folk music, this book makes a timely con- tribution to studies of cultural politics by showing with considerable nuance how a tradition can become a self- conscious heritage and national icon. In 2009, Quan Ho Bac Ninh Folk Songs was inscribed on UNESCO's Rep- resentative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Hu- manity. Defining and reframing quan ho as cultural her- itage has further complicated the relationship between village and professional quan ho and raises crucial issues about who has the authority to speak for quan ho in the international context. Sounding Out Heritage offers an in- depth account of the impact of cultural politics on the lives and practices of quan ho folk singers in Vietnam and shows compellingly how a tradition can mean many things to many people." Taking It to the Bridge: Music as Performance. Nicholas Cook and Richard Pettengill, eds. Ann Arbor: The Univer- sity of Michigan Press, 2013. 381 pages. ISBN: 978-0-472-07177-7 (cloth); ISBN: 978-0-472-05177-9 (paper); ISBN: 978-0-472-02930-3 (e-book). Description: "Taking It to the Bridge places renowned scholars from performance studies and musicology in con- versation for the first time to spark a productive new dia- logue on music as performance. The overriding aim of this groundbreaking volume - whether the subject is vocal or- namentation in nineteenth-century opera or the collective improvisation of the Grateful Dead - is to give new recog- nition to performance as the core of musical culture. The book is on the one hand a series of in-depth studies of a broad range of performance artists and genres, and on the other a contribution to ongoing methodological develop- ments within the study of music, with the goal of bridg- ing the approaches of musicology and performance stud- ies to enable a close, interpretive listening that combines the best of each. At the same time, by juxtaposing musi- cal genres that range from pop and soul to the classics, and from world music to games and web-mediated perform- ances, Taking It to the Bridge provides an inventory of con- trasted approaches to the study of performance and con- tributes to its developing centrality within music studies." Violence: Analysis, Intervention and Prevention. Sean Byrne and Jessica Senehi. Athens, OH: Ohio University Press, 2013. 274 pages. ISBN: 978-0-89680-285-8 (paperback); ISBN: 978-0-89680-481-4 (electronic). Description: "Our world is desperate to comprehend and address what appears to be an ever-enlarging explo- sion of violence. But the causes of violence are complex, demanding deep multidimensional analysis in order to understand its driving forces. Violence: Analysis, Inter- vention, and Prevention provides a multidisciplinary ap- proach to analyzing and resolving violent conflicts. This book argues that ecologies of violence and micro- macro linkages at the local, national, and international levels, as well as processes of intervention and preven-</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF RITUAL STUDIES 28 (1 ) 201 4 113 tion, are critical to transforming conflict in constructive ways. In the aftermath of such destruction there is hope in the resiliency, knowledge, and creativity of communi- ties, organizations, leaders, and international agencies to transform violent conditions for the better." Virtual War and Magical Death: Technologies and Imaginarles for Terror and Killing. Neil L. Whitehead and Sverker Finnström, eds. Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2013. 289 pages. ISBN: 978-0-8223-5447-5 (paperback). Description: "Virtual War and Magical Death is a provocative examination of the relations between an- thropology and contemporary global war. Several argu- ments unite the collected essays, which are based on ethnographic research in varied locations, including Guatemala, Uganda, and Tanzania, as well as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and the United States. Foremost is the con- tention that modern high-tech warfare - as it is practiced and represented by the military, the media, and civil- ians - is analogous to rituals of magic and sorcery. Tech- nologies of "virtual warfare," such as high-altitude bomb- ing, remote drone attacks, night vision goggles, and even music videos and computer games that simulate battle, reproduce the imaginative worlds and subjective experi- ences of witchcraft, magic, and assault sorcery long stud- ies by cultural anthropologists. Another significant focus of the collection is the U.S. military's exploitation of ethnographic research, partic- ularly through its controversial Human Terrain System (HTS) program, which embeds anthropologists and cul- tural experts in military units. Several pieces address the ethical dilemmas that HTS and other counterinsurgency projects pose for anthropologists. Other essays reveal the relatively small scale of those programs in relation to the military's broader issue of, and ambitions for, social sci- entific data." Witchcraft, Intimacy and Trust: Africa in Comparison. Peter Geschiere. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2013. 293 pages. ISBN: 978-0-226-04758-4 (cloth); ISBN: 978-0-226-04761-4 (paper); ISBN: 978-0- 226-04775-1 (e-book). Description: "In Dante's Inferno , the lowest circle of Hell is reserved for traitors, those who betrayed their clos- est companions. In a wide range of literatures and mythologies such intimate aggression is a source of ulti- mate terror, and in Witchcraftt Intimacy, and Trust, Peter Geschiere sketches it as a central ember at the core of human relationships, one brutally revealed in the prac- tice of witchcraft. Drawing a variety of local conceptions of intimacy into a global arc, he tracks notions of the home and family - and witchcraft's transgression of them - throughout Africa, Europe, Brazil, and Oceania, showing that witchcraft provides powerful ways of ad- dressing issues that are crucial to social relationships. One of the few books to situate witchcraft in a global context, Witchcraft, Intimacy, and Trust, is at once a theoretical tour de force and an empirically rich and lucid take on a difficult-to-understand spiritual practice and the private spaces it so greatly affects."</page></plain_text>
