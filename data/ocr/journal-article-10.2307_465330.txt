Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan, eds. RESPONSES: ON PAUL DE MAN'S WARTIME JOURNALISM. Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 1988. Something crisis-like was taking place at that moment, making practices and assumptions problematic that had been taken for granted. -Paul de Man, "Criticism and Crisis" By most accounts, the disclosure of Paul de Man's wartime journalism precipitated something of a "crisis": the term recurs insistently in what is by now a host of reflections on the import, theoretical and political, of those early texts. In "Blindness and Hindsight," one of thirty-eight essays collected in Responses, Catherine Gallagher notes the way in which this crisis scenario dovetails with recent mainstream press reports of "the failure of the humani- ties in general and literary studies in particular"-an ongoing journalistic narrative, alarmist in tone, that casts "theory" as a kind of invading force on the cultural landscape. That story, of course, is traceable to academic sources, indebted to a rhetoric of crisis generated by some within the profession who take "theory"-by which they most often mean "deconstruction"-to be a threat to established habits of thought and what are called traditional values. Among the professors of literature who have gone on record as deploring theory's incursion into the humanistic disciplines, Walter Jackson Bate led the way with his manifesto "The Crisis in English Studies," published in Harvard Magazine in 1982. Bate's claim is that "The humanities are not merely entering, they are plunging into their worst state of crisis since the modem university was formed a century ago ... [T]he humanities are not only in the weakest state they ever suffered but seem bent on a self-destructive course..." [46]. And he indicts "the strange stepchild of structuralism known as 'deconstructionism,'" a "nihilistic view of literature, of human communi- cation, and of life itself," as chiefly responsible for the current crisis. As Gallagher rightly discers, "The discovery that de Man had written for a collaborationist journal fit beautifully into this story because it provided a perfect symmetry between the beginning and the end. Deconstruction was no longer just the harbinger of outrages against humanity; it actually originated in such outrages. The outcome could no longer be in doubt because it was contained in the original" [Responses 204; cited hereafter as R]. In these terms, the disclosure of the wartime writings could elicit a collective "I told you so" from critics as well as journalists who had judged deconstruction outrageous all along. diacritics 20.3: 28-49 28</page><page sequence="2">In one of the first substantive reviews of Wartime Journalism and Responses, Lynne Higgins complicates this symmetrical narrative of origins and ends, even as she too adopts the rhetoric of crisis: "Reading the two volumes together," she writes, "gives one a sense of the current identity crisis within literary studies. The de Man 'affair' did not create that crisis, but it does magnify the complexities and raise the stakes" [105-06]. For literary critics whose stake in the matter may amount in great part to self-interest, to fear for the possibility of their own contamination through the operative "logic of transmission," "Protection consists of mastering continuities and constructing distances.... It is the very indirect and mediated nature of the degrees of collaboration that makes it terrifying. The identity crisis takes the form of an urgent question: is the work I'm doing complicitous with something I would be horrified to be associated with?" In times of crisis-Higgins here invokes the current AIDS epidemic, not simply as an analogy-"we have to know who we are sleeping with. We want 'safe criticism"' [110]. The texts comprising the wartime journalism-a heterogeneous corpus including contributions to the Belgian dailies Le soir and Het Vlaamsche Land and the monthly Bibliographie Dechenne, all issued under the control of the occupation authorities, as well as to Jeudi and the Cahiers du Libre Examen, the weekly newspaper and monthly journal of the socialist student circle at the Universit6 Libre de Bruxelles, published prior to the occupation-were themselves written out of what the young Paul de Man repeatedly diagnosed as a "crisis," one whose dimensions were manifold. In "A la recherche d'un nouveau mode d'expression," a review of Charles Dekeukeleire's L'emotion sociale published in Le soir in March 1942 (a month in which, as the detailed chronology compiled by the editors of Responses notes, "German military authorities institute obligatory labor service for some categories of workers" [R xvi], and in which Le Soir, with an average daily circulation of 255,000, is the most widely read periodical in the country [xvii]), he advises his readers that "The military events, as gigantic and full of consequence as they are, cannot make us forget that at the same time a crisis of a spiritual order is proceeding whose historic import is incalculable" [Wartime Journalism 208; cited hereafter as WJ]. And allusions like that to the "particularly delicate crisis that a man passes through around his twentieth year" ["Le probleme de l'adolescence," Le soir 30 June 1942; WJ 246] suggest that the "spiritual" crisis concomitant with the political upheaval had a biographical, an autobiographical aspect for the young journalist as well. This rhetoric of crisis, sustained in many of his contributions toLe soir andHet Vlaamsche Land, is harnessed to a logic that argues collaboration to be a pragmatic, indeed a necessary, response to the current state of affairs, to the force of "facts," of "history": "There thus emerges the demonstration of that ineluctable truth of history," he writes in July 1942, in a review of the second volume of Fabre-Luce's Journal de la France: "the politics of collaboration results from the present situation not as an ideal desired by all of the people but as an irresistible necessity which none can escape, even if he thinks he ought to move in another direction" [WJ253; see also the review of Chardonne's Voir lafigure, Le soir 28 Oct. 1941; WJ 158-59]. In "Qu'est-ce qu'un collaborateur?," Sartre identifies this logic (and ideologic) as that of "realism." Werner Hamacher elaborates the significance of Sartre's "insight": the ideology of realism, identified as a central element of collaboration, is itself a danger to democratically organized societies. The pragmatism, positivism and historicism which have long been a part of the ideological profile of democracies can hardly be regarded as anything other than variants of that realism whichfinds thefinal guarantee of reality in the power of so-calledfacts. This reality is actually first generated by all sorts of societal-and not only societal-institutions and all sorts of techniques-among them techniques of language.... It is in realism that Sartre marks the point of complicity between diacritics / fall 1990 29</page><page sequence="3">democratic and fascist systems. Putting this realism into question is an eminently political act, even if it is not articulated in explicitly political terms, but rather in linguistic and philological ones (as,for example, in de Man's later writings). No one with a critical mind will be startled that the institutions of this ideological realism try to denounce any such questioning as an attack on the basic foundations of 'Western values.' [R 448] Nor should it come as a surprise that the denunciations are couched in the rhetoric of crisis. In the aftermath of the archival discovery that brought de Man's earliest publications once again to light, the "crisis" translates, especially for those indebted to his later work, as a need, an imperative to make sense of an event that has disrupted working premises and practices. Perhaps the event-character of the disclosure of the wartime journalism, which in the view of Samuel Weber as well as other commentators administered "a shock and an intensity in direct proportion to the influence of [de Man's] work and to the respect inspired by his person" [R 410], might best be thought not so much as a contingent bibiographical find, but rather on the model of a missive, an open letter-a letter bomb- delivered after long delay. Barbara Johnson speculates that "Whether or not those articles contributed in any way to the wartime history of Belgium"- a question explored at length and in detail in a number of the contributions to Responses--"the arrival of this long- delayed letter strikes us now with the full disruptive force of an event. It is an event that is structured like what de Man describes as an 'occurrence'-an irreversible disruption of cognition." But in this case, she goes on to specify, "it is a disruption that is happening to his own acts of cognition. It is as though de Man had tried to theorize"-after the fact, in the mature work-"the disruption"-before the fact, in and by the precritical if not pretheoretical journalism-"of his own acts of theorizing, had tried to include the theory's own outside within it. But that theory's outside was precisely, we now know, always already within. And he could not, of course, control the very loss of control he outlined as inevitable and defined as irony.... The arrival of this purloined letter, then, is an event not only for de Man but also for his readers, however uncannily his theory might have predicted its inevitability" [xii]. Johnson's account credits de Man's late essays-she quotes the 1983 lecture "Kant and Schiller," but could as well have cited "Hypogram and Inscription," "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist," or "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant"-with a reflection on the nature of historical occurrence, and specifically on its accessibility to cognition, that makes a particular claim on our attempts to make sense of the explosive event at hand, the belated disclosure of the abandoned writings. More generally, she helps to focus the question, posed insistently inResponses, of the continuing importance of de Man's mature work not only for "the epistemological analysis of what 'reality' is and how it de-constitutes itself in the tensions of language" [Hamacher, R 454] but also and especially "for any analysis of the totalitarian impulse insofar as it transmits itself in texts," "for the historico-political analysis of textuality in general," as "an effective analysis of historical acts [and events, 'occurrences'-DE] which are dissociated from cognition by language" [Kamuf, R 225]. Other formulations in Responses explore the pertinence of de Man's analysis of the dissociation of cognition from performance on the one hand, and from what he termed "the materiality of actual history" on the other. A number of these employ blindness as a figure for the disruption, the failure of cognition in the face of the event. As against Gallagher's summary assessment that "Hindsight has revised nothing and confirmed everything" [R 207], Cynthia Chase writes that "After the emergence of de Man's 1940- 42 articles, one necessarily writes about his writing differently than before-insofar as one writes about a subject they do not as such address, about an occurrence they do not see. The reappearance of those abandoned texts is something that happens to de Man's 30</page><page sequence="4">writing from the outside"-an "outside" that, as Johnson observes, was always already within, which is to say it is not so much an outside as a before- which thus strikes it with blindness with regard to what is nevertheless its own situation, or rather ours, that of his students, readers. Here for the first time indubitably is an occurrence pertinent to his writing which it cannot see and about which it has nothing to say. But at the same time it says a great deal about just thatpredicament-the blindness of writing; and also-but why is it only now that one learns to read this?-about the implication of thought and writing in the violence of history, and particularly that European 20th-century violence, Nazism.... [44] Chase's argument, grounded in a meticulous reading and rereading of the journalism as well as the theoretical work, is not only that de Man's late essays on the aesthetic ideology (in particular "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist") are crucial for thinking "the complici- ties of modes of education and models of history with the fascist totalitarian state," but also that "these writings' not knowing, not seeing their circumstances-which is not a matter of repressing or concealing-is a key dimension of what they give us to read" [R 44]. Reading, our reading, must account for the blindness, for the critical failure of cognition to inscribe a certain history. In "Edges of Understanding," Rodolphe Gasch6 has recourse to the same figuration in characterizing the severe shortcomings of the early work: the essays of Het Vlaamsche Land and Le Soir do not show de Man to have sensed the catastrophic danger that Nazi Germany represented not only with respect to the Jewish people, but to the whole of Europe and the celebrated values of Western civilization as well. This is rather difficult to understand today, after thefact. But if de Man did not come to grips with the horror that was in the offing, it was among other things because his analytical apparatus did not provide the means to capture the viciousness and aberration of the Nazi endeavor on all fronts. [R 215]. (As Hamacher specifies, "Despite the control [the articles] exercise over it, the vocabulary of the time is virtually never scrutinized or redefined" [R 438].) And Gasch6 concludes that, if the young de Man's "intellectual instruments (like those of most of his contempo- raries, and of many present intellectuals as well)" kept him from a precise understanding of events, "It was left to the later de Man to systematically put into question all those blinding schemes, categories and concepts by means of which he had, in his journalistic writings, unsuccessfully tried to gain insight into the political situation in Belgium in the early forties" [R 215]. Among the most suggestive accounts of what it is that the event of the disclosure summons us to read and to think is Geoffrey Hartman's, in "Looking Back on Paul de Man," his two-part contribution to Reading de Man Reading (the essay's first part was written before, and the second after, the wartime journalism came to light). "By an irony that deserves a name of its own," he writes, "the disclosure of the early articles imbeds a biographical fact in our consciousness that tends to devourall otherconsiderations. It may not spare the later achievement, whose intellectual power we continue to feel." We continue to feel, for example, the force of de Man's theorization of the blindness of writing, the limits of criticism and self-criticism. "One could argue," Hartman pursues, that there is no relation between the young journalist, age twenty-one, and the distinguished theorist who published hisfirst book at agefifty-one. Or that what diacritics / fall 1990 31</page><page sequence="5">am :..4 !;;; ... I A. .. I</page><page sequence="6">relation obtains is one of reaction formation, as when he accuses Husserl of blindly privileging "European supremacy" at the very time (1935) that Europe "was about to destroy itself as center in the name of an unwarranted claim to be the center." For de Man too was a European who "escaped from the necessary self-criticism that is prior to all philosophical truth about the self." [18] But, Hartman is careful to add, "what we are seeing here"-always allowing for our own blindness-"is a special case of what happens all the time. A new fact, often a new text, makes a difference in the way we read. Although history has moved more quickly in this case, we are always in the situation of having to revise our judgment of a work, however monumental it once appeared to be" [18]. It is no accident that the recurrent topoi of these responses-criticism and crisis, blindness and insight, irony and history among them-should be drawn from de Man's theoretical legacy. In particular, these formulations redirect us to Blindness and Insight and to its opening essay "Criticism and Crisis," first published in 1967, where de Man interrogates the "recurrent epistemological structure that characterizes all statements made in the mood and the rhetoric of crisis" [ 14]. As Hartman recalls, that analysis enlists ("[f]orreasons of economy") "an example from philosophy," the 1935 lectures that would later become Husserl's The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phe- nomenology, and their description ofphilosophy as a process by means of which naive assumptions are made accessible to consciousness by an act of critical self-understanding. Husserl conceived ofphilosophy primarily as a self-interpretation by means of which we eliminate what he calls Selbstverhiilltheit, the tendency of the self to hide from the light it can cast on itself. The universality of philosophical knowledge stemsfrom a persistently reflective attitude that can take philosophy itselffor its theme. [15] But when Husserl's reader, "[a]lertedby this convincing appeal to self-critical vigilance," is led to apply the philosopher's standard to the very text in which it is established, that text is found wanting in its own terms, above all when it claims philosophy as "the historical privilege of European man." Husserl speaks repeatedly of non-European cultures as primitive, prescientific and pre-philosophical, myth-dominated and congenitally incapable of the disinterested distance without which there can be no philosophical meditation. This, although by his own definition philosophy, as unrestricted reflection upon the self, necessarily tends toward a universality that finds its concrete, geo- graphical correlative in theformation ofsupratribal, supranational communities such as, for instance, Europe. Why this geographical expansion should have chosen to stop, once andforever, at the Caucasus, Husserl does not say.... The privileged viewpoint of the post-Hellenic, European consciousness is neverfor a moment put into question; the crucial, determining examination on which depends Husserl's right to call himself, by his own terms, aphilosopher, is infact never undertaken. As a European, is seems that Husserl escapes from the necessary self-criticism that is prior to all philosophical truth about the self.. .. Husserl's claim to European supremacy hardly stands in need of criticism today. Since we are speaking of a man of superior good will, it suffices to point to thepathos of such a claim at a moment when Europe was about to destroy itself as center in the name of its unwarranted claim to be the center. [15-16] diacritics / fall 1990 33</page><page sequence="7">Writing "in what was in fact a state of urgent personal and political crisis about a more general form of crisis," Husserl unwittingly exemplifies what de Man takes to be "the structure of all crisis-determined statements.... The rhetoric of crisis states its own truth in the mode of error. It is itself radically blind to the light it emits," to the insight it makes possible. Husserl thus joins the ranks of thinkers in whose critical practice de Man discerns a cognitive mechanism figured as blindness and insight. As Wlad Godzich ably summarizes and situates de Man's analysis, its theoretical and potentially its ideological and institutional consequences: the blindness, far from being disabling, was constitutive of the insight, yet nonetheless remained a blindness to the person affected with it. It was this predicament of critical activity that led de Man to formulate a more properly theoretical stance in which the mechanism of blindness and insight would be understood without being disabled, or at least not in such a way as to render further insights impossible. De Man's solicitude in the preservation of the mechanism has something profoundly disquieting, if not downright scandalous, about it. Our impulse, bred in the bone by several centuries of education, is to correct an error when we come across it. De Man's willingness to let it be marked a profound break with a major component of the Western cognitive tradition, one that is the motor of the disciplines, especially the scientific ones. [155; see also Graff, R 249]. In the instance of Husserl's text, then, de Man is led to ask: How does this pattern of self-mystification that accompanies the experience of crisis apply to literary criticism? Husserl was demonstrating the urgent philosophical necessity of putting the privileged European standpoint into question, but remained himself entirely blind to this necessity, behaving in the most unphilosophical waypossible at the very moment when he rightly understood the primacy ofphilosophical over empirical knowledge. He was, infact, stating the privileged status of philosophy as an authentic language, but withdrawing at once from the demands of this authenticity as it applied to himself. [16-17] In "Disfiguring the Monument," Weber glosses de Man's account: De Man's "point" ... is that the notion of self-criticism, with reference to which Husserl seeks to define the specificity of Western philosophy, itself depends upon a highly contradictory set of assumptions which themselves may well comprise the enabling limit of "criticism" itself (and which hence would have to remain uncriticized and uncriticizable). These assumptions have to do with Husserl's use of the term "European" to define and determine the philosophical attitude of self-criticism he is engaged in defending against the crisis that has befallen it. [408] In Weber's assessment, then, "the question raised by de Man with respect to Husserl (in both senses of that phrase)1 involves the status of criticism itself, and concomitantly, the 1. "De Man treats Husserl with a 'respect' that is more than mere politeness; it acknowledges his own indebtedness, since if he questions Husserl, it is only by extending Husserl's conception of critical self-reflection to the philosopher's determination of self-criticism as 'the historical privilege ofEuropean man' (deMan), in order to argue that the very project of attributing universal validity to a localized phenomenon reveals that the notion of self-criticism itself reposes upon an 34</page><page sequence="8">problem of judgment, that is, of proceeding from the particular (European man) to the general (the universal validity of the self-critical attitude of philosophical thought)"-this inscription of the particular in the general being for de Man "the purpose of any cognition" [The Rhetoric of Romanticism 276, cited hereafter as RR]. "What is at stake in this problem," as Weber makes plain, "is the relation of thinking to alterity, to the others: here, the non-European. Thequestion de Man is raising is that of self-limitation, of demarcation. ... the point... [is] that the 'spiritual' generalization of European humanity in order to define a norm of thought valid beyond the limits of the European continent, requires necessarily the exclusion and subordination of other cultures" [R 408]).2 How then-if at all-are we to bring to bear on de Man's own history, on the grave pattern of self-mystification inscribed in the wartime writings, the lesson for which Husserl serves (the later de Man) as example? Do the terms and distinctions afforded in the theoretical work indeed make a particular claim on our efforts to render intelligible its relation to the early journalism-a claim that we ignore or reject at the expense of a better understanding? If we attend to the passage in which de Man locates the operation of blindness and insight in Husserl's text ("Husserl was demonstrating the urgent philo- sophical necessity of putting the privileged European standpoint into question, but remained himself entirely blind to this necessity, behaving in the most unphilosophical way possible at the very moment when he rightly understood the primacy of philosophical over empirical knowledge"), we find that much of the burden of the argument falls on the sense or senses of "demonstrating," among them "proving beyond the possibility of doubt by a process of argument or logical deduction" [OED], by way of a line of reasoning that can close with quid est demonstrandum. Analysis of Husserl's demonstration thus yields a logic of blindness and insight, based on the principle of noncontradiction, that seems sufficient to his case, since the "blindness"-unphilosophical behavior-and the "in- sight"-right understanding-occur "at the very [same] moment," since "[h]e was, in fact, stating the privileged status of philosophy as an authentic language but withdrawing at once from the demands of this authenticity as it applied to himself." The simultaneity that marks the operation of the logic, the law of blindness and insight in Husserl's text might seem to promise the possibility of a dialectical mediation of the two terms, but it is nonetheless "against any dialectical reappropriation or synthesis of blindness and insight that de Man is waging his most explicit, powerful attacks. In trying to define the relation of blindness and insight, he insists: 'The contradictions, however, can never cancel each other out, nor do they enter into the synthesizing dynamics of a dialectic' [BI 102]" [Klein 36]. The impossibility of a dialectical resolution is all the more emphatic in de Man's own case. If we "apply de Man's statement about Husserl's claim to European supremacy to the writer of 'Inhoud der Europeesche gedachte"' [de Graef, R 119], we find that the de Manian corpus resists the imposition of the categories of blindness and insight conceived according to a logic dictating their mutual cancellation or dialectical synthesis. For the two textual conditions do not occur simultaneously, are not copresent in this body of work, but are separated by more than a quarter-century. In these terms, a decisive difference uncriticized, and perhaps uncriticizable, presumption of 'self" [Weber, R 423nl1]. We do well to keep in mind such indebtedness when we make use of the critical tools with which de Man has provided us in seeking to dismantle the ideologemes operative in his own early writings. 2. "Derrida, in his recent study of Heidegger, De 1'esprit, is drawn to cite the same passage. ... And to the question 'Why recall such a passage and cite it today?' Derrida replies, in part: 'Using the example [sur 1'exemple] of a discourse that in general is not suspected of [harboring] the worst, it is good to recall that referring to the spirit, to freedom of the spirit and to the spirit as European, could and stillcan be allied with apoliticsto which onewould liketooppose it.' De 1'esprit, 95 n.21" [Weber, R 409]. diacritics / fall 1990 35</page><page sequence="9">between Husserl's case and de Man's-a difference that de Man's late writings help us to read-is that in the latter the temporal dimension is not contingent but constitutive. The stakes-and the eventual outcome-of the crisis to which the disclosure of the wartime journalism has given rise thus depend upon the possible articulation of the early texts with the later ones, as a reading of Responses makes clear.4 Gasch6 writes that "undoubtedly, it is the relation, the absence of a relation, or something other than a relation ... between the early journalism and de Man's mature work that represents the most interesting problem... no analysis of what is to be related, of the sort of relation that is possible, in the firstplace, between the relata, seems to have been undertaken" [215-16]. "De Man's early writings... are a far cry from what he was later to become involved in, and thus itis no small task to demonstrate any significant relation between the two corpuses" [217]. In Derrida's formulation, that sizable task is specifically "to articulate [the wartime writings] with the work to come while avoiding, if possible, two more or less symmetrical errors": that of declaring "no relation, sealed frontier between the two, absolute heterogeneity," and that of "amalgam, continuism, analogism, teleologism, hasty totalization, reduction and derivation" [151], of "asserting complete identity, as though discontinuity and history were a mere ruse or epiphenomenon [Weber, R 410, emphasis mine]. An articulation that would do justice to such a history-and to history as such- must first pass by way of a thinking of temporality, a reading of the relation of past to present that presumes neither a straightforward economy of exchange, nor a homogeniz- ing, totalizing narrative of origins and ends. If we begin by rereading the conceptual metaphors of blindness and insight in light of the intervention of time that renders the terms radically asymmetrical, we find that the sense of "demonstrating" ("Husserl was demonstrating .. .") as the working out of an argument or a logical deduction yields to a more properly rhetorical (and practical) sense: that of the demonstration effect of the example. In these terms, Husserl was blindly offering himself as an example of blindness (the figure, again, for his "unphilosophical behavior") "at the very moment" when he was stating his insight into the superiority of philosophical over empirical knowledge.5 And in de Man's case, the wartime writings could be understood in part to serve as examples-in advance-of the (precritical, ideological) blindness that the later (critical, theoretical) insight will expose, unsparingly, as such.6 This economy of the example would not be subsumable under any logic or 3. In his reading of Rousseau's Second Discourse, de Man allowsfor such a temporal inter- vention in what initially appears as a logical contradiction: "Are we forced to conclude that Rousseau's paradoxes are genuine contradictions, that he did not know, in the Discourse, what he stated in the Essay, and vice versa? Perhaps we should heed his admonition: 'in order not tofind me in contradiction with myself, I should be allowed enough time to explain myself " [Allegories of Reading 149]. 4. Higgins examines the "recurrent motif ofcontinuity and rupture" in the efforts in Responses to articulate early with late de Man. She also interrogates possible continuities and discontinuities between de Man and deconstruction, collaboration and resistance, journalism and scholarship [108-o 1. 5. On the constitutive blindness of philosophical reflection, see also Zii'ek: "There is the theatre in which your truth wasperformed before you took cognizance of it. The confrontation with this place is unbearable because philosophy as such is defined by its blindness to this place" [19- 20]. 6. The operation of blindness and insight, as de Man understood it, could be summoned as a partial explanation-if one were required-for his disinclination to meet in advance the demand made by John Brenkman and others that he set the record straight with a public confession or apology ("De Man eschewed any acknowledged reflection on his writing and activity during the war. He participated in fascism publicly, but did not abandon it publicly" [R 21]-although, as several essays in Responses attest, de Man made his writingsfor the collaborationist press known 36</page><page sequence="10">dialectic: neither before nor after the fact can one control or fully account for one's own status as example, with its unpredictable effects of meaning and of force.7 Reflection on the demonstration effect of the example also prompts active consider- ation of the question of how occupied Belgium remains an examplefor us-a question that may be overlooked if our response to the disclosure takes the tempting form of simple condemnation. As Hartman writes in "History and Judgment," "Denunciation, at this point, is not enough; it tends to foster a paranoid style of localizing evil that removes the issues too far from our time" [69]. "Mere reactions," concurs Hamacher, "are powerless, especially when dealing with the discourse of totalitarianism.... Elements of totalitarian ideologies live on-and most stubbornly in those who proclaim their own immunity" [R 466-67]. The question of how the then and there chronicled by the young journalist may implicate us, here and now, poses the challenge of thinking history not as a symmetrical, totalizing narrative of origins and ends, but in the precise terms of the material specificity of the event. "'History,' this vague abstraction, seems then and now to function as a powerful means of homogenizing and making a taboo out of history-namely that history which exists only concretely, singularly, idiosyncratically, painfully. To judge history on the basis of its empty generality is to deny the past its particularities, and to run the risk of repeating it in its worst traits" [Hamacher 463]. This is a risk we can hardly afford to run unawares-which is to say, blindly. Doch lies nur, lies! -Goethe, Die Wahlverwandtschaften ... the gift of an ordeal, the summons to a work of reading, of historical interpretation, of ethical-political reflection-an interminable analysis well beyond the sequence 1940-42. In thefuture andfor thefuture.... -Derrida, "Like the Sound of the Sea Deep within a Shell: Paul de Man's War" Rather than resorting to empty generalities, summarizing the heterogeneous argu- ments of the wartime journalism as well as those of Responses, we may do better (not only "for reasons of economy") to explore these questions on the basis of an example-one of the few-of a text de Man engaged in his early as well as his later work, in order to posit a possible articulation of the two, and to substantiate what we have alluded to as his to a number of people at critical junctures in his career). Once again, Godzich provides an economical summary: A blindness constitutive of an insight was far more interesting than the result of its correction would be: at best, the latter would smooth out the argumentative path through which the insight was obtained; at worst, it would erase the traces of the functioning of a cognitive mechanism that forced anyone examining it into wondering about the provenance of insight, and thus of the workings of cognition in general. Correcting errors sets the record straight, eliminates impediments to thought; reflecting upon blindness, on the other hand, forces thought into a reflective judgment about its own tortuous and discontinuous path, the very blindness of which consists in the fact that it has no guide to warn against its vagaries. [155] 7. With reference to de Man's praise of Charles Peguy as a Dreyfusard, in the "Chronique litteraire" for 6May 1941 [WJ 85-86J, lanBalfour takes note ofthe effect that the example of Peguy may have exercised on de Man: "By holding up Peguy's life as exemplary, [de Man] offers an implicit contrast to his own position" [R 8]. diacritics / fall 1990 37</page><page sequence="11">blindness and insight. The example is Goethe'sDie Wahlverwandtschaften (The Elective Affinities), whose French translation de Man reviewed in Le soir in May 1942. He un- dertook to analyze the novel again more than forty years later, in a lecture for "Reading and Rhetorical Structures," a course he taught in the Literature Major at Yale University in the spring of 1983; the late lecture is thus contemporaneous with his readings of Kant, Schiller, and Kleist, and their elaboration of his critique of the aesthetic ideology.8 In it, de Man radically revises his former judgment of Goethe's text. Before engaging the terms of de Man's commentaries on the novel, early and late, we might recollect a passage in which Goethe's text itself speaks to circumstances akin to those of the disclosure of the wartime journalism. In the novel's ninth chapter, the laying of the foundation stone for the new summer-house is marked with an elaborate ceremony, featuring an address by the mason on the importance for the architectural project of his craft, which, "if it be not done in concealment, yet must pass into concealment" [English 64; German 66]: But as the man who commits some evil deed has to fear, that, notwithstanding allprecautions, it will one day come to light-so too must he expect who has done some good thing in secret, that it also, in spite of himself, will appear in the day; and therefore we make thisfoundation stone at the same time a stone of memorial [Deswegen machen wir diesen Grundstein zugleich zum Denkstein]. Here, in these various hollows which have been hewn into it, many things are now to be buried, as a witness to somefar-offworld [Zeugnis fureineentferte NachweltJ- these metal cases hermetically sealed contain documents in writing [schriftliche Nachrichten]; matters of various note are engraved on these plates; in thesefair glass bottles we bury the best old wine, with a note of the year of its vintage. We have coins too ofmany kinds,from the mint of the currentyear ... There is space yet remaining, if guest or spectator desires to offer anything to the after-world. ... But in that we bury this treasure together with [thefoundation stone], we do it in the remembrance-in this most enduring of works-of the perishableness of human things. We remember [wir denken uns eine M6glichkeit] that a time may come when this cover so fast sealed shall again be lifted .... [English 65- 66; German 66-67]9 The written documents (Nachrichten, news reports, literally after-accounts) sealed in this time capsule-which is always potentially a time bomb-share an affinity with de Man's wartime writings: both are emphatically of their time in theirreferential function, butboth reemerge at a future date, like the long-delayed letter (arriving, now, from before and beyond the grave), coming to light for what Hamacher terms "their second phase of use" [438]. In the concluding entry in his "Journals, Politics," one of the most consequential essays in Responses for thinking history as of the order of events and their possible articulation, Hamachercites deMan'sLesoirreview: "On May 26,1942 de Man writes- under the title 'Universalisme de Goethe,' a discussion of Goethe's Wahlver- wandtschaften-several sentences which are not written by an ideologue, a tactician in a politico-literary battle, or an accomplice of the collaborationist press, but by a reader. 8. The version of the lecture cited here was compiled from three sets of notes recorded by colleagues and students in attendance (including my own). Taken together, the notes make for a full and detailed, if not verbatim, transcription. 9. In his Life and Works of Goethe, Lewes cites the author's reflection on the novel: "'In it, as in a burial urn, I have deposited many a sad experience. The 3rd of October 1809 (when the publication was completed) set mefreefromthe work: but thefeelings it embodies cannever depart from me"' [520]. 38</page><page sequence="12">The other sentences must not be forgotten; these should be remembered as well. They concern the 'strange interlude' in the middle of the novel, in the early chapters of the second section, during which 'absolutely nothing happens which would advance the development of the drama."' He goes on to translate de Man's text: There has been a great deal of discussion about the appropriateness of these pages, which seem unbearably long to some. And yet, they constitute one of the most alluring and originalparts of the whole work.... It seems, though, that their principal raison d'etre is the introduction into the novel of the factor of time, of the duration [de Man's emphasis] of events. Reality never presents itself as an uninterrupted movement towards a denouement: it marks the stopping times [temps d'arret] during which, under the empire of inertia or human automatism, entirely eventless periods unroll their monotonous uniformity. A narrative which aims to produce the real rhythm of existence must insert such epochs.... [Tjhe interlude in the Wahlverwandtschaften is certainly one of the most successful attempts of this kind. [R 467; WJ 238]10 In attending to the economy of memory and forgetting crucial to our responses to these texts, Hamacher is right to mark, with emphasis, the distinction between de Man as an ideologue and as a reader: both play a role in the not altogether homogeneous corpus of the wartime journalism. Specifically, the youthful ideologue and tactician serves what the later theorist and reader would target under the rubric of the aesthetic ideology. The pursuit of the latter critique necessarily passes by way of what he termed "critical- linguistic analysis" [The Resistance to Theory 121], including, importantly, a sustained investigation of the values associated, at least since the late eighteenth century, with symbolic and allegorical conceptions of language. With reference to Goethe, Schiller, and Schelling as well as to Coleridge, de Man argues in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" that the symbol, predicated on the assumed continuity and simultaneity of "the sensory image and the supersensory totality that the image suggests," in turn grounds an understanding of the subject-object relation "in which the experience of the object takes on the form of a perception or a sensation. The ultimate intent of the image is synthesis," and "the mode of this synthesis is defined as symbolic by the priority conferred on the initial moment of sensory perception"-i.e., on the aesthetic moment [BI 189, 193]. The symbol, then, proves to be the linguistic condition of possibility of "a certain claim for the autonomy and the power of the aesthetic which is being asserted in the wake of Schiller, but not necessarily in the wake of Kant"-that is, the aesthetic ideology ["Kant and Schiller," Al]. Allegory, in de Man's reading, disrupts the possibility of the symbolic synthesis by opening up a constitutive temporal dimension, the difference that divides the 10. Lewesprovides an example of the "discussion about the appropriateness" ofthe interlude, commenting that A dear friend of mine, whose criticism is always worthy of attention, thinks that the long episodes which interrupt the progress of the story during the interval of Eduard's absence and return, are artistic devices for impressing the reader with a sense of the slow movement of life; and, in truth, it is only in fiction that the denouement usually lies close to the exposition. I give this opinion, for the reader's consideration; but it seems to me more ingenious than just. I must confess that the stress Goethe lays on the improvements of the park, the erection of the moss hut, the restoration of the chapel, the making of new roads, &amp;c., is out of all proportion, and somewhat tedious. [525] I am grateful to Lesley Turnerfor calling this passage to my attention, andfor noting that the view of Lewes's friend (possibly George Eliot) corresponds to that of de Man in the Le soir review. diacritics / fall 1990 39</page><page sequence="13">allegorical sign from the previous sign to which it refers. Allegory confesses the failure of coincidence forgotten or repressed in the model of the symbol, in which the relationship of image and substance is taken to be "one of simultaneity, which, in truth, is spatial in kind, and in which the intervention of time is merely a matter of contingency" [207]. In its detail and its scope, this analysis effects a radical revision of the conventional literary- historical and aesthetic categories through which we read romanticism (and idealism)- the same categories that are in full force in de Man's early review of The Elective Affinities. In the review's first paragraph, the spirit of Goethe is said to be "independent of the conditions of space and time," and the novel, "one of Goethe's most perfect works," to be "the living image of the universalism of its author" [WJ 238]. De Man's assertion that there is nothing in or about the novel "that does not seem to us essentially modem" stands as an awkward precedent to the claim in his late essay "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist" that, "for all the attention it has received," the text on the marionette theater (published in 1810, and thus virtually contemporaneous with Die Wahlverwandtschaften, which appeared in 1809) has nonetheless "remained curiously unread and enigmatic," and "belongs among the texts of the period which our own modernity has not yet been able to confront, perhaps because the Schillerian aesthetic categories, whether we know it or not, are still the taken-for-granted premises of our own pedagogical, historical and political ideologies" [RR 266]. The review takes for granted the rhetoric and the ideology of the symbol, with its values of continuity, organicity, homogeneity, symmetry, and totality, and in a gesture akin to Husserl's use of the term "European" in his defensive demarcation of the properly philosophical, maps them onto European culture, based on a rigid logic of national stereotyping. As Hamacher comments, "It can appear as a logic, as a consistent mode of thought, because it makes the claim that the nation, the national community, is itself a homogeneous and substantial form not only of that which has been thought, but of thought itself. Therefore nationalism is a substantialism-a substantialism of community conceived of as nature" [439]. Gasch6 and Chase, among other contributors to Responses, point out that the ideo-logic of nationalism in the wartime writings does not simply serve the interests of the occupying power: "The issue which is a decisive thread running through most of the articles-the concern with national personality and difference, patriotic feeling, the protection . . . of national patrimony, the persistence of the independence of nationalities-is incongruous with thedominantNazi ideology" [Gasch6, R 211]. The presence in the articles of such stereotyping by no means amounts to celebration of German nationality or the German nation; the characteristic qualities of at least three nations, France, Belgium, and Germany, are being identified and valued, in terms exerting some check or pressure upon the design of German domination. But while the stereotyping thus lacks a direct andpro- Nazi political significance, its deeper ideological significance persists. [Chase, R 50] Symptomatic of that ideological significance, as Chase remarks, is the fact that "the reviewer's strongest interest or enthusiasm is elicited by the co-presence of these [national] qualities or the circumvention of their opposition" [50], which he finds, for example, in Goethe's novel: a latin as well as a germanic sensibility will be touched by its content in every sense ... [Olne could take pains to situate the Elective Affinities in the norm of the literary traditions of all the greatEuropean creative centres. We will limit ourselves to examining the work with respect to the French and German artistic 40</page><page sequence="14">qualities: the synthesis of these two national temperaments, a rare and uneasy realization, being already amply sufficient to justify its particular attraction. [WJ 238] The balance of the review is given over to this examination, culminating in the final paragraph: In conclusion, this conjunction, in the same work, of so many different qualities, a conjunction obtained without the unity of the narrative and of the thought sufferingfor an instant, confers on it an unequaled merit.... At certain moments, the totality of riches dispersed among the nationsforming western civilization are concentrated in an elect, who thus becomes the universal genius. With this work, we witness one of these unique moments in the history of letters. [239] Such claims help to specify the blindness that crippled de Man's understanding in much of the wartime journalism. In a review of A. E. Brinckmann's Geist der Nationen (which he also cotranslated), he writes that What is proper to our time is the consideration of this national personality as a valuable condition, as a precious possession, which has to be maintained at the cost of all sacrifices. This conception is miles apartfrom sentimental patriotism. Rather, it concerns a soberfaith, a practical means to defend Western culture against a decomposition from the inside or an overwhelming onrush by neighboring cultural norms. [Het Vlaamsche Land 29-30 March 1942; WJ 303] Weber discerns the "pattern of self-mystification that accompanies the experience of crisis" here, commenting that What is "proper to our time," then, is not simply the valorization of the national or of nationalism, but rather the sense of these values being threatened: by internal "decomposition" or by "surprise attack." What is "proper to our time," in short, is the sense of dangerfrom without andfrom within.... It is not enough to define the identity of Europe internally, as it were, in terms of the "mutual exchanges" of the different national groups that inhabit the European continent. That identity must also be set off and apart from what it is not,from the non-European, the foreign. That is, from the Other. ... Totality is never whole ... The other of the European ... is,first andforemost: the Jew. It is the Jews who intrude, deranging the "continuity" and immanence of Western History: in this case, that of German Literature, thus causing it to deviatefrom its proper, predestined course. [416] The rhetoric of crisis is here yoked to the logic of nationalism as agonism that may be understood to yield (or, minimally, not to prevent) arguments like those in "The Jews in Contemporary Literature."'' Thus the ideologue's "stereotypes, along with the models of 11. "Nationalism is an agonism. It draws its life not from the natural community of a nation, butfrom the will to destroy the other, in whose image it is at the same time supposed to be created. The logic of nationalism is the logic of homicidal, suicidal identification" [Hamacher, R 439]. Hamacher deliberately poses the question as "what was it that did not prevent such articles ?" For "Only when it is asked in this way is the question not really a question about a hidden determinism to which the intellectuals of that time would havefallen victim; and only when asked in this way does the question give the answer a chance to isolatefactors in the situation of intellectuals that would still, even today, not prevent a comparable commitment to a no less disastrouspolitics" [440]. He diacritics / fall 1990 41</page><page sequence="15">thought they propagate, become among the most appalling products of the century" [Hamacher 438]. As tactically deployed and maneuvered in de Man's review of the translation of Die Wahlverwandtschaften, the national stereotypes operate for the most part along predict- able ideological lines. The traits that align the novel with "the great French classical tradition," chief among them "the eternal leitmotif of French prose: the primacy of the psychological motive," also account for its strikingly "modem accent." But In no recent work, even in an age in which the knowledge of the human soul has made considerable progress and the psychological tournure d'esprit has be- come more commonplace, can one indicate a clearer, more coherent analysis. The perfect harmony between the introspective and active parts of the content, thefact that each gesturefinds its equivalent in the profound conformation of the one who performs it, these are the fundamental virtues that we find here. [238] The "'French' virtues" of the novel, then, are those of"the equilibrium and mutual rapport of the component parts," the "perfection of the proportions among the different elements," "the rigor of the logical arrangement"-or, as he enumerates in "Le probleme fran,ais. Dieu est-ilfrangais? deF. Sieburg," "the virtues of clarity, logic, harmony" that comprise "the constants of the latin spirit" [Le soir 28 April 1942; WJ 226-27]. Other aspects of Goethe's text, however, serve to remind the reader that it is "contemporaneous with that flowering of the germanic genius that is German Romanti- cism." De Man's review maintains that key elements in the novel exceed the psychologi- cal and the rational ("not everything is clarified by simple reason"), indicating a "supernatural power that eludes all analysis." "The death of the two lovers," for example, "which is not explained by any illness or any physiological fact, symbolizes a supra- terrestrial union, and thus no longer belongs to the realm of tangible verisimilitude." He remarks "the violence of certain passions that are raised above all contingency to enter into eternity," assimilating it to "the metaphysical sentiment of the infinite proper to German thought," through which "the novel reflects the nationality of its author." (Given that he is writing about a French translation of Goethe's prose, it is worth noting the absence here of anything presaging the mature reflection on translation, on the constitutive distance dividing the translated text from the original, that de Man provides in his late lecture on Walter Benjamin's "The Task of the Translator.") Finally, he aligns The Elective Affinities with the German literary tradition by way of its subordination of aesthetic to ethical interests: if in the French canon, "from Racine to Gide," moral dilemmas are posed only for the sake of their aesthetic potential, "it is completely otherwise in the present case": Goethe's "profound germanism" enlists the aesthetic in the service of the ethical, "drawing practical conclusions with respect to education and to conduct." The same set of priorities is associated with the German tradition throughout the wartime journalism: for example in Le soir 15 July 1941 (a re- view of Paul Willems's "Tout est reel ici") and 28 April 1942 ("Le probleme francais," cited earlier), and in Het Vlaamsche Land 20 August 1942, where, in "People and Books. A View on Contemporary German Fiction," de Man observes that "in present-day Germany there lives and flourishes a literature which is directly connected with that of the great precursors," with "the profound essence of [Germany's] artistic genius," "the spiritual property of the nation." The leitmotif (the red thread, as Goethe famously figures it) accounting for this continuity is "the profound moral disposition ... the ambitious treatment of ethical problems," "the proper traditions of German art which had always and also reminds us that we should not forget the articles in Jeudi that callfor a practical critique of the nationalist spirit [439]. 42</page><page sequence="16">before everything else clung to a deep spiritual sincerity." That tradition, he argues here, was challenged in postwar German culture by the expressionist movement, in the work of "non-Germans, and specifically Jews," who pursued "an art with a strongly cerebral disposition, founded upon some abstract principles and very remote from all naturalness," resulting in "skillful artifices aimed at easy effects," and "a forced, caricatured represen- tation of reality" [WJ 325]. Gasche's rigorous, nuanced analysis of this blinded "View" points out among other things that "the cerebral quality of expressionism, that sets it over and against the other type of German literature, is an attribute associated throughout all the articles not only with Jewish thinking"-as in the reference to the Jews' "strongly cerebral disposition" in "The Jews in Contemporary Literature"-"but with French culture in particular" [R 210; cf. the "cerebralite qui a triomphe dans les lettres franqaises de l'epoque actuelle," WJ 139]. This cerebrality, abstraction, and artifice are among the traits he will ascribe, in "The Rhetoric of Temporality," to allegory. Indeed, de Man's late work itself "exhibits all the negative characteristics cited by the young Paul: cerebrality, abstraction, a tendency to 'diff6rencier a outrance"' [Johnson xvi]. But in the wartime journalism, the values associated with the symbol prevail virtually unchallenged. Those values give the impetus to articles like "Le destin de la Flandre" [Le soir 1 September 1941; WJ 139-40], a programmatic text in which de Man seeks to define and demarcate the "nation"-in this instance the Flemish nation-to establish its origin and its essence according to aesthetic criteria. The particular "genius" of Flemish art, with its "elective virtues" of pictorialism and realism, accords Flanders the status of an art-nation whose cultural and political autonomy must be preserved in the face of the current imperialist threat ("one can pose the question of its political destiny only as a function of its cultural qualities"). Hamacher assesses the ideological import of this national aestheticism: as a theory of the originality, autonomy and essence of a nation, [it] demon- strates unmistakable affinities with the national-aesthetic myths of origin propagated in fascist Germany at the same time. There can be no doubt about the proto-fascist substance of this theory. But-with it de Man makes himself the defender of the art-nation Flanders against the cultural andpolitical imperialisms of the neighboring nations and above all against the pan-Germanic annexation policy of the National Socialist regime. De Man turns the national-aesthetic ideologeme-which not only suited the occupation powers and their organized Belgian supporters, but was even borrowed from their own ideological re- sources-against the Nazi's integration plans ... and uses it as an argument not only for the cultural autonomy but also for the political independence of Belgium. [443]12 A few months later, in a review of Willems's "Tout est reel ici," de Man argues the participation of Belgian fantastic realism, the outgrowth of Flemish pictorial realism, in both the German romantic and the French surrealist traditions, at no cost to its (relative) autonomy. In this sense, contemporary Belgian art is the privileged locus of the synthesis of the great cultural blocs of Europe, France, and Germany, now at war. "But what in the antagonistic art-nations ought to join together to create this Belgian unity must itself already have the character of the European synthesis": it is in this context that "de Man praises Goethe's combination of a sensibilite latine and a sensibilite germanique, la synthese de ces deux temperaments nationaux; and he lauds Ernst Jiinger, the only other 12. A "decisive ideological-political point" in such an instance is, in Hamacher's formula- tion, "to be able, in a given historical moment, to estimate precisely howfar the resistance and how far the exploitability of a particular ideologeme reaches" [444]. diacritics / fall 1990 43</page><page sequence="17">German author for whom he shows unrestrained admiration, for his combination of myth and reality" [Hamacher 454]. Given the virtually uninterrupted, rapid-fire deployment of national sterotypes in these articles, those few junctures at which the reviewer hesitates, however briefly, warrant further consideration. In the course of enumerating the "'French' virtues" of Goethe's novel ("the rare perfection of the proportions ... the rigor of the logical arrangements," etc.), he writes that "One point in this admirable architecture"-one of the novel's own figures for proportion, balance, and symmetry-"merits that one pause over it longer." This is followed by the sentences, singled out by Hamacher as written by a reader rather than an ideologue, on the "strange interlude" early in the novel's second part, which suspends the narrative development but functions crucially to introduce "the factor of time, of the duration of events." De Man pauses, takes time (a quantity in short supply in journalism, particularly of the daily variety) to single out for attention the place where the novel itself pauses, interrupts itself to introduce the time factor. He takes the time, that is-if only a moment-to read. The review then resumes its ideological course, and its brisk pace, as de Man goes on to align the introduction of the time factor, of duration, with "the 'French' virtues of the 'Affinities,"' ascribing it to the "rigor of the logical arrangement," specifically that of the mimetic logic of realism: "a narrative which aims to produce the real rhythm of existence must insert such epochs." He then proceeds directly to catalogue the novel's "German" features. To read such a passage now, after the fact (the fact of its first and its second appearance, the fact of the late work), is in part to ask whether the factor of time can indeed be understood as contingent (upon national origin, for example), whether it can be subsumed under one or another "logical arrangement"? The de Man of "The Rhetoric of Temporality" and the essays that followed would answer that, where texts are concerned, it cannot. When the factor of time is understood not as contingent but as constitutive, it resists assimilation to such a logic (of nationalism, of realism, of blindness and insight). In the review of The Elective Affinities, it may serve to skew the opposition and the synthesis of the art-nations, as allegory skews the symbol, as the fact that the foundation- stone of the summer-house is also and at the same time [zugleich] a memorial stone-at once a time capsule and a grave marker-may skew the spatial symmetry of the "admirable architecture" both of the building and of the novel itself. The "introduction of the time factor," then, may be understood to disrupt the rhetoric and the ideology of the symbol that, when mapped onto European culture and politics in 1940-43, yielded the national aestheticism (the phrase is Lacoue-Labarthe's, in his La fiction du politique) that determines much of the wartime journalism. The argument of de Man's late work, its theoretical reflection on rhetoric and ideology, is that, in Hartman's words, "Any mode of analysis that sees the text as an organicist unity or uses it for a totalizing purpose is blind, and the text itself will 'deconstruct' such disclosures' ["Looking Back" 19]. This would include the argument of his 1983 lecture on the Wahlverwandtschaften. The lecture begins by invoking the novel's "sombre," "upsetting," and "haunting" quality, suggesting that the reader "can be unaware of [the] sombreness until it catches hold," with a "belated shock effect" (like that of a time bomb). De Man goes on to assert that the novel's "dreamlike" overdeterminations are "not symbolic, not transposable into a single symbolic register," that the "different registers [are] not necessarily compatible." The claims that he makes for the unity of the novel's symbolic system in theLe soir review are in the late lecture subsumed under the first of "three levels of reading." The initial level or moment is that of "trope," of the text's "literal [and] figural diction."'3 "This novel is, 13. The model of language as trope was addressed in detail in the lecture preceding this one in the course, given by J. Hillis Miller. See his "A 'Buchstdbliches' Reading of The Elective Af- finities": "The basic paradigm of The Elective Affinities is the following: Human relations are 44</page><page sequence="18">more than any other text you can read, about language," and de Man's reading first takes into account its system of symmetrical "exchanges" and "substitutions." He offers a "summary in terms of geometrical figures" of the relations among the principal charac- ters: they are "structured like a circle or rather a sphere," and also as a "cross"; the tropology thus draws on the "highly formalized, symbolic language" of Rosicrucianism and freemasonry that "hangs over eighteenth and nineteenth century literature" (he mentions Wilhelm Meister and Die Zauberflite and adds, ironically, "once you're aware of this you'll go crazy. The less you know about it the better." That irony takes a sharp turn in light of the wartime journalism, for example the "Introduction to Contemporary German Literature" [Le soir 2 March 42; WJ 200-01], an account of the 1942 German Book Exposition that Alice Kaplan calls the "rhetorical apogee of de Man's collaborative writing" [R 276]).14 The cross within the circle figures the "principle of totalization" conveyed most notably through the "analogy of the chemical reactions" elaborated in the novel's fourth chapter. In the "equation between elements" (CaCO3 + S042 = CaSO4 + CO2+ H20), the "original formulation is symmetrical," reflecting the "balance," the "specular relation between [the] two sides of [the] equal sign" and "allowing for crossing over." The "affinities [that] develop" between Eduard and Ottilie, the Captain and Charlotte do so according to this "rigorously symmetrical" model: hence the "double adultery," the "double resemblance" in the child, the "baptism [of the child]" and the "death [of the priest]." That "symmetry is the principle of totalization" that organizes the narrative. It is fitting that the chemical formula provided is that for limestone and gypsum, for the "principle of building" that is a "constant" in the novel "is itself a principle of symmetry." Its thematic function is multiple, since building (e.g. the construction of the summer-house) is also "the figure of marriage," "tied to the institution of marriage" as a "balance between Blutverwandtschaft (filiation) and Seelenverwandtschaft (affinity)," between the genetic and the erotic (he here alludes to Benjamin's essay on the novel, and its citation of Kant's Metaphysics of Morals, which defines marriage as "the union of two people of different sexes in lifelong reciprocal possession of one another's sexual properties"). Thus the "equation sets [the] pattern of the book. [The] polarities, by crossing over, result in totalizations," "all under [the] aegis of [the] fundamental metaphor of building," of "Stiftung as the grounding of an institution," the "property on which the stability of [the] balance [between] genetic [and] erotic rests." And the story itself, "based on [the] principle of symmetry [is] as such like a building, an architectonic." De Man here reads the text's symmetries in terms of the tropological function of language, the operation of figures like chiasmus and prosopopoeia: the "elaborate system of symmetries," of "specular relations," is "one of [the] powerful forces of trope-it is the system of trope, [with] its overdeterminations," that establishes the "integrated unity in [the] presentation of the novel" ("everything relates to everything else") that the young journalist praised in the Le soir review. But in the lecture, de Man goes on to discern a "disturbance of [the] symmetry on the level of tropes." And it is here that the later encounter with Die Wahlverwandtschaften locates the intervention of the time factor, for like the substitutions in metaphorical expressions, or, to put it the other way, since these metaphorical analogies are reversible, the laws of language may be dramatized in human relations" [7]. 14. De Man cites the Reichsleiter Baldur von Schirach, who "situates the problem with complete clairvoyance: 'Hewho calls Goethe afreemasonor the "Magic Flute" afreemason opera is not taken seriously by our people.... Each great work... is always the expression of an isolated personality and, at the same time, of the entire nation. But the nation is not only the current and the immediate, but the eternal community of language and of blood....'" And de Man comments in conclusion: "It is because German literature has conformed to these sage precepts that it has been able to realize its goals and to prepare the way for future greatness" [WJ 201]. diacritics / fall 1990 45</page><page sequence="19">this disturbance occurs "temporally": "what seems to work in space doesn't work on [the] temporal level." As evidence, he cites the insistent role in the narrative of "impatience" and haste [Eile], associated especially with the impetuous Eduard, who "plays the flute too hurriedly" in his duets with Charlotte, such that the "tempos don't coincide." He recalls as well the symptomatic scene of reading in which "Charlotte runs ahead in reading over [his] shoulder as Eduard reads aloud," resulting in a "distortion that disrupts [the] spontaneous illusion of representation, of voice, in reading"; Eduard likens the effect to being "torn in two," a figure that anticipates the subsequent fate of Nanni, Ottilie's companion, who is "literally" dismembered (then re-membered) near the novel's end. Such "confusion of literal and figurative" accounts for the always possible "fundamental error of reading, of interpretation" that consists in "taking one for the other"-as in taking death for life in the tableau vivant, which depends on effects "achieved by trope" for its "complex balance of life and death." "To represent dead painting as alive is [a] mistake. The tableau is not vivant"--with consequences for Goethe's text, whose "narration in [the] present [tense]" affords a "succession of tableaux vivants." The sense that "reading is dangerous in the novel" is confirmed when, in the "movement from adultery to infanticide" in the narrative's "succession of crimes," the drowning of the child is presented "as a result of Ottilie's reading" (in a scene in which she is represented allegorically, as the "emblematic figure of the patron saint of Alsace, book in hand," fatally forgetful of death). The "system of symmetrical tropes is undone in this play with life and death." Moreprecisely, the symmetry established "at the level of trope [is] undone by temporality," "disturbed by a temporal lack of convergence," by the introduction of the factor of time. "The epistemological asymmetry of knowing" is a temporal asymmetry: "things don't come together in time." Yet this "undoing" can be "recuperated on [the] level of representation," to the extent that this story of negative knowledge can still be told. The lecture goes on to elaborate what disrupts or resists totalization in terms of other moments of reading, other functions of language. De Man invokes the "level" or "system of the letter," the "asemantic" function associated with the termsBuchstabe ("mistranslated as symbol") and Zeichenspraches and embodied in the figure of Ottilie as "allegorically overdetermined element" (the several characters "thematize" one or another "linguistic function": "there are no persons in this book"). In scenes like that in which Ottilie copies Eduard's contract ("by means of which property is acquired, [the] house set up") in handwriting that comes to resemble his own-or in which, at any rate, he can only see his own-the "crossing takes place on the literal level of Handschrift," of the "materiality of writing, of inscription." The "level of the letter" "undoes [the] level of representation, of trope"; it is "no longer [a] thematics, no longer [the] realm of trope and substitution," "no longer of [the] order of representation," but rather of the order of "allegory." The fate of the characters is "inscribed in the nature of language": "Ottilie becomes mute, [the] letter loses its voice." And the "hopelessness of this is intolerable. Hard to take. No escape. Intolerable. That's the way it is." Finally, de Man suggests the possibility of a further "recuperation" at the "level of narrative control" (of "Goethe's 'wir"'), a possibility he terms "dialogism."15 But again, the intervention of time prevents this recovery from being complete. For in the novel itself, "wrong stories [are] constantly being told at [the] wrong time," in the manner of "gaffes" that are "fine, coherent as stories, but told in untimely fashion," with results that are "deeply and fundamentally embarrassing," indeed "catastrophic" (he recalls the effects of Mittler's remarks on Ottilie, and especially those of the interpolated tale of the "strange young neighbors" on Charlotte). For readers of the novel, the lecture concludes, the dialogic "asymmetry" raises the questions: "is [Goethe's] story timely for us? Can 15. De Man interrogates the concept of dialogism as developed in the work of Bakhtin in "Dialogue and Dialogism" [RT]. 46</page><page sequence="20">we attain Goethe's serenity?" The answer afforded in the lecture-a far cry from the reassuring assertion of the "universalism of Goethe" in the early review-is that the story "never comes at the right time," is "always untimely," that it is "always a catastrophe to understand it." "This is dialogism-[the] fundamental asymmetry of [the] dialogical situation": the asymmetry between the text and its reading that troubles our own efforts to read the past in the present, to read (for example) the wartime journalism in this, its second phase of use.16 If we reread the Le soir review in the retrospective light of the late lecture, we find that the apparent unity, symmetry, and harmony it prizes in Goethe's novel are made possible by a highly formalized tropological system, the system on which knowledge and cognition depend. The moment in which the review pauses to consider the time factor- and so, potentially, its disfiguring, asymmetricalizing effect, its exposure of the precari- ous status of the text's totalizations-is immediately reinscribed in the symbolic system, according to the mechanism analyzed in the late work whereby the threat posed to cognition is, inevitably but erroneously, reinscribed in a tropological system of cogni- tion-whereby the historical event is recuperated for, implemented in, one or another aesthetic and political program. It would be left to essays like "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist" to analyze "the complicity between the aesthetic valorization of form"- specifically the model of trope, the "transformational turns and substitutive exchanges of which are necessarily informed by a telos of infinite totalization"-and "totalitarian claims to hegemony" [Weber 413,415]. The late essays seek to elaborate, to make explicit the articulation of "textual models and the historical and political systems that are their correlate" [de Man,RR 289]. As Chase suggests, "the correlation... between a totalitarian state and a model of the text as a 'formal system of tropes' (RR 285) is more than an impression and other than an analogy" [R 55]. The burden imposed by the correlation of the textual and the political, like that imposed by the attempt to articulate early with late de Man, is that of reading: the relations (whether of continuity and complicity, or discontinuity and distance) cannotbe presumed, but must be read, again and again, in each here and now. "The suspension of the necessity of reading needs to be resisted because it closes down the possibility of a future. In doing so, it is inevitably totalitarian, whereas reading, in suspending, is not inevitably totalitarian, which does not mean that it is inevitably democratic either-reading is not inevitably anything, that's why it holds out the promise of a future" [Warminski, R 387-88]. This is also the burden (and the promise) of the effort to correlate text and history, the order of language and the order of the event. It is the burden assumed, in no uncertain terms, in de Man's late work. As Weber argues, the conception of history in the essays from "Shelley Disfigured" to "Kant and Schiller" is a far cry from that advanced inLe soir 16. Hamacher recalls an experiment that Max Horkheimer proposed during a television interview: that of "reading newspapers afew weeks or months after their publication." Hamacher comments: One can imagine that the effect he had in mind was supposed to be both philosophical and political. Indeed, the effect of this small postponement, on his perception of time and on his attitude to news and published opinion, should be considerable. The reader of these old papers will notice that the imperatives, attractions and threats heralded in them reveal themselves as such only to the degree that they no longer directly affect him. The judgments that the newspapers imposed on him at another time can now be dismissed as hectic presumptions. In the future he will no longer so easily obey the regulations of the newspapers and their time .... Horkheimer's is a piece of political advice that looks forward to the suspension of coercion and to its transformation for another way of life. ... After all, one of the dangerous effects of the chronological order in which newspapers appear is the numbing of the sense of what history and what the present could be. [457] diacritics / fall 1990 47</page><page sequence="21">and Het Vlaamsche Land, for example in "Criticism and Literary History," where history appears as a "continuity" in which "one generation ensues logically from the preceding one" [Het Vlaamsche Land 7-8 June 1942, WJ 313-14]; the two understandings "are separated by a practice of reading which is both informed by a theory of language and which transforms it in turn" [R 413-14]. The order of events, as theorized in de Man's mature writings, is assimilable neither to a logic (or dialectics), nor to the tropology of cognition, nor, finally, to temporality. History, as "Kant and Schiller" demonstrates, is not a movement of mediation, not a temporal process, but a radical transformation "from cognition, from acts of knowledge ... to something which is no longer a cognition but which is to some extent an occurrence, which has the materiality of something that actually happens, that actually occurs ... that leaves a trace on the world" [Al]. In this sense, history is "what is happening," as Derrida writes, and"happening to us." For Derrida, as for de Man, as for Goethe's eloquent mason, history "belongs to the order of the absolutely unforeseeable, which is always the condition of any event"-for example, the disclosure of the wartime journalism. "Even when it seems to go back to a buried past, what comes about always comes from the future" [R 128]. From the work to come. WORKS CITED Balfour, Ian. "'DifficultReading': De Man's Itineraries."
