<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theology Forum The Presence and Absence of God M?ce?l Ledwith Often whefl people are troubled or experiencing tragedy they turn to God in prayer. Sometimes they seem to feel they have received no reply, or even fail to experience any sign of God's presence. How they react to this depends on the person's predispositions and it is exceptionally difficult to generalise. Normally the more deep and mature the faith of the person, the more likely he or she is to see this apparent silence or apparent absence of God as a time for purification. The more shallow the faith and the more inadequate the religious ideas in a person's consciousness the more likely that person is to react with impatience, hostility or even agnosticism. Among the principal causes of such reactions are, in the first place, preconceived and sometimes false notions about how God worked in this history of salvation in the past in bringing about his plan; and secondly, erroneous ideas about the nature of God and the consequences this may have in determining the character of God's work in the world. With regard to the misconceptions about God's work in history it is often imagined that God's presence in Old Testament times was always obvious, sure and certain in his dialogue with his chosen people: a radical contrast, it is felt, to the ways in which he now sees fit to deal with his new chosen people. Without in any way wishing to diminish the strong faith and real presence of God in the history of the Jews, even a brief look at the Old Testament will suffice to show that the strong faith of Israel did not bear on a God who was always blatantly obvious and apparent to those who formed that faith and history. There is abundant evidence of God's apparent self-conceal ment as well as revelation: a process in which light and darkness alternate. God at times seems to be as much absent as present. The response of the people to this apparent absence also varied, ranging from the grumbling of the Israelites in the misery and abandonment of the M?ce?l Ledwith is a priest of the Diocese of Ferns, Professor of Dogmatic Theology at Maynooth and Editor of The Irish Theological Quarterly.</page><page sequence="2">THEOLOGY FORUM 571 desert to the complaint of Gideon, 'If God is with us ... why is all happening to us now?' (Judges 6), a complaint echoed in the appeals to God in Psalm 44: 'Wake up Lord. Why are you asleep? Awake and come to our help.' The constant answer of the Jewish religious leaders was that these absences of God were only apparent: that they were often meant to serve a purpose ? the chastisement of the people, so that through his absence they will be brought in a paradoxical way to look more deeply for his presence and avoid the temptation to look to idols for help. It is a striking fact that often when we experience the absence of God we tend to turn to divine substitutes for consolation: as the Hebrews turned to Assyria and Egypt, or to the Baal in Numbers 25. It is hardly necessary to cite .the fate of the Hebrews who followed such a course to realize the futility of such policies. All good things in this world come from its creator, and as his creation each in its own way reflects his glory, even if in a dim way. In this light the things of this world serve as clues to the nature and character of God and can lead us on to him, but only if they are seen as clues and not as ends in themselves, which is when idolatry occurs. If a creaturely thing becomes elevated into a divine substitute the result is always unfortunate. In the case of personal relationships, for instance, friend ship or love easily becomes too possessive when people are treated in this way, and it is a fact of experience that nothing will destroy friend ship or love faster than the weakness of character in one partner causing an excessive dependence on the other. This can often be illus trated tragically in the relation of married couples, or in the way in which children react to over-anxious and possessive parents. The attempt to produce divine substitutes is the most dangerous type of religious reaction that there can be to an experience of the apparent absence of God. To remain with the Old Testament as our guide, there is ample evidence there to suggest that God was felt at times to have^ abandoned history totally and given it over to the sway of the forces of evil. God had made repeated promises to Israel that he would stand by her as his chosen one. However, the history of Israel seems to have displayed little that could be termed success from the secular point of view: it was a long series of disasters punctuated by two brief periods of glory at the time of David and Solomon. About six hundred years before the birth of Christ two events more than any other seem to indicate a complete withdrawal of God from the history of his chosen people, and an apparent forgetfulness of his promises. These events were the death of King Josiah in battle at Megiddo against Egypt. No king had been more faithful to his God than he, nor had any one else done more to reform and purify Jewish worship.</page><page sequence="3">572 THE FURROW His defeat by his enemies posed an immense challenge to faith. The second blow was the capture of Jerusalem a generation later by King Nebuchadnezzar and the exile of the people of Israel. This picture of God's apparent abandonment of history is balanced by Israel's confidence in his pervasive presence in the world. It is easily apparent that Israel did not see these acts of God as haphazard, but as planned and executed with careful deliberation on the part of God. These interventions of God are not always positive things resulting in success and protection, but occasionally take the form of punishment or chastisement, while God's promises neverthe less stood firm. The theological reflection that attempts to explain the variety of God's dealing with the world is set out in the early chapters of the Book of Judges; Success, prosperity and peace are given by God in direct proportion to the fidelity of the people, while war, defeat and failure come as a result of infidelities. God's promises remain constant throughout: it is the people who vary and cause this alteration of God's methods of dealing with them for a time. This interpretation was deepened further in the meditation in the Book of Job. There are some instances where the conviction of God's active power in history downplays the human role. This can be seen best probably in some of the texts relating to the Exodus journey, in which at times it seems as if no human contribution were required. But the Old Testament representative tradition emphasised the necessity of human co-operation with the divine. Divine transcendence is a concept often forgotten in reflection on the divine activity in the world, and many misunderstandings result in consequence. While the early Old Testament was strongly anthropomorphic in character, emphasising the reality, nearness and relevance of God, often at the expense of more spiritual notions, the priestly tradition from about the sixth century onwards stressed the divine transcendence more and more. This in general remained a constant feature of the subsequent Old Testament. Some outstanding witnesses to the divine transcendence are to be found in Second Isaiah: Tn the beginning he called into existence everything which is' (40:12 ff.), no image from this earth can capture the reality of God (40:46); all notions of the divinity pale into insignificance before the true God. His holiness distances him from the world, especially from its infidelity and sin. The challenge the divine trans cendence issues is a call to faith without reservation in the majesty and glory of God who will without fail come to redeem. In the Book of Job we have another poignant reminder of God's transcendence this time as it affects an individual. The essence of the meditation on the problem of evil there consists in Job's perception of</page><page sequence="4">THEOLOGY FORUM 573 God's absolute transcendence. The significant feature from the Book of Job however, is the way in which the attitude of Job is praised while that of his three questioners is condemned. The reason their attitude is deemed unsatisfactory, even though they profess to be defenders of God, is that they have reduced God to manageable proportions, forgetting the depths of his mystery. It is important to note that God's majesty is in no way indicated to be something akin to an absurdity, inherently incomprehensible to man: the inadequacy in trying to probe the mystery of God's ways comes only from the side of human intelligence unable to grasp the full richness and complexity of mystery. An important factor in meditating on the transcendence of God is that God works in the world as its creator, and as such this work will be characteristically different from any type of creaturely activity. This is exceptionally important since it is usually a human-style activity that we expect from God, without realising our mistake. As creator God will be continually at work in this world so as to being about his will, without having recourse to anything resembling an alteration of his plan to deal with new contingencies. As such God's most characteristic actions will be in and through the process he has created, and will only appear exceptional to those who have the eyes of faith to detect them in their context. This does not preclude the possibility of God's dramatic intervention in the course of human history, but says that the former type of activity is more character istic of the creator. Again this is far from suggesting a quietism in the face of God's inexorable will, for time and time again we are told of the necessity of human co-operation in God's continuing redemptive act in this world. One of the most striking places in the Scripture where the question of the presence and absence of God is posed is in Christ's words from the cross: 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' (Mt. 27:46; Mk. 15:34). This is an echo of the age-old plea of the afflicted man before God in the tradition of the Book of Job and it has often been construed as an immense problem, even suggesting that Jesus may have departed this world in a mentality of abandonment by God. This was a favourite theme of Dietrich Bonh?ffer, for instance, in his elaboration of the duty of a Christian in a world without God. These words of Christ are the opening verses of Psalm 21, and the key to the difficulty seems to lie in the Hebrew method of citation, which was done, not in the modern Western fashion by quoting title or author, but by giving the opening words of the document being cited. For example, in the Hebrew Bible the title of Genesi^is 'In the beginning .. .' The true significance that we ought to attach to these words of Christ on the Cross, then, is that Christ recited Psalm 21 in</page><page sequence="5">574 THE FURROW its entirety when he was close to death, but this is cited by the Evangelists according to the Jewish custom of giving only the opening verse. This puts an entirely different meaning on these words of Christ. Psalm 21 has a triple structure. The opening section up to verse 20 is the cry of the man who feels abandoned by God, laid open to the mockery of his enemies, at the mercy of the evildoers who surround him. But in verse 20 the mood of the Psalm changes dramatically: 'But you, O Lord, stand not far from me .. .' the suffering one reflects that God is still with him, and the last third of the Psalm is a hymn of profound confidence, trust and praise to a faithful and constant God. These were the sentiments with which Christ died: a model of the faithful servant brought to death because of his fidelity to God's will. In summary, the picture we obtain from the Old Testament in regard to the problem of the presence and absence of God is that God is always active in the process of the world even when he seems to be absent: apparent absences of God are illusory and they often simply prepare the way for saving deeds. God's presence in history may not alone bring favour but also chastisement and it is evident that God's plan and its meaning often display a pattern only in retrospect after the tortured path of faith has been followed for some time. A consoling thought is that a sense of the absence of God can only come to an individual who is confident of God's ability to intervene and direct the course of things and who is surprised that this direction does not appear more obvious or take specific forms. In this way the sense of God's absence can actually be a testimony to the implicit faith of the individual concerned.</page></plain_text>
