FRIES The association of determinism with the coming of experimental science in the modern world was an unnecessary carry-over of certain aspects of the medie- val belief that the aim of knowledge is to grasp or contemplate "eternal truth." If we take a science such as chemistry or physics as typical instead of astronomy, it would seem that control of actual concrete transformations is the acid experi- mental test rather than prediction of "inevitable" future events. The latter surely has the smell of pre-scientific prophecy. If so, and if we choose to base our interpretation of science and our philosophy of nature on this consideration, we can avoid determinism without in any way limiting the efficacy or potential universality of science. At the same time we avoid the traditional metaphysical or theological notion of "free will." With such an approach the aim of scientific inquiry may be said to be the improvement of abstract conceptual instruments for securing concrete control. Engineering, medicine, etc., use the abstract material of science for directly practical aims. So-called "pure" science "uses" its abstract material for the purpose of improving it. Thus science constructs causal controls. They work because of actual connec- tions or interactions in the concrete world of experience. H20 is an abstract expression of connections among concrete experiences of hydrogen, oxygen, water, etc. It enables the chemist to control certain transformations. The connections are not causes, but are the natural basis of human causal control. Thus it is an anthropomorphic fallacy to read causes into nature. There are actual natural connections (which doubtless change, at least over long periods of time) which are shaped by human art (e.g., by science) into causes. Causes are thus "natural" in the sense in which any art product is "natural." It is important to distinguish the abstract conceptual aim of science from the inseparable test of (or aim for) control of concrete transformations. For (1) this distinguishes so-called "pure" science from the applications of science as these have developed to date; and (2) understanding the conceptual aim of "pure" science, we can try to systematize the concepts which control the applications of science in such a way as to provide a self-corrective or experimental pattern, or, in other words, to try to overcome the traditional "separation" of theory from practice which has characterized the development of modern science and society. 179</page><page sequence="2">180 HORACE S. FRIES To this end we should examine carefully the type of systematic conceptual rela- tions which obtain in an abstract set in the natural sciences in order to see how an experimental correction is reflected throughout the set. Why is it, for ex- ample, that Einstein's set with fewer independent assumptions than Newton's is a more powerful abstract instrument than the latter for further discovery of transformation controls and for improvement of the conceptual material? The positivist analyses are fruitless, it seems to me, because of a theory of abstraction and observation which does not account for the actual operational relevance of scientific conceptual material to control. But Dewey (Logic, The Theory of In- quiry) has made a start from the logical side, and (Freedom and Culture) from the cultural side; and Wertheimer (Productive Thinking) has at least revealed some significant problems from the psychological side which bear directly on the logical question. If we carry the conceptual aim over into the applications of science (practice), we can understand the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to make the latter self-corrective. Say that we set out to transform concrete human interests, in a specific instance of conflict, into interests which will enable a richer satisfac- tion to accrue (or which will decrease the frustrations which accrue). This is the art of genuine mediation, and is analogous to engineering or medicine as the applications of the natural sciences. But let us add that we are interested not only in securing richer or more satisfying interest patterns, but also in improving systematically the abstract conceptual material which we employ in drawing up our mediating plans; e.g., concepts which pertain to human nature and social institutions. We are then interested in ethical theory as well as practice. Furthermore, our theory is experimental in its approach. The human interests (in process of change in any case) which will wreck our mediative plan or carry it to some degree of success are the objective conditions for testing our conceptual instruments for transforming interests into more satisfactory patterns. We can- not aim to improve such abstract concepts (the theoretical aspect) without at the same time aiming to enrich the interest-satisfactions in our hypothesis-plans which test the concepts. For if we aim for unsatisfactory plans (unsatisfactory to the interests involved in the conflict situation) we aim to wreck our hypotheses which are to test our concepts. Thus we unite theory and practice in a great natural-ethical experimental undertaking. University of Wisconsin.</page></plain_text>
