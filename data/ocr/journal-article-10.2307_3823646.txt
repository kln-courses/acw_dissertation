<plain_text><page sequence="1">Prejudice, Paradox and Prediction: Conceptual Cycles in Physics VALENTINE L. TELEGDI I have been asked to explain to you what makes physics exciting-so exciting that the building and operation of a gigantic laboratory such as Fermilab is regarded as a necessary undertaking not only for the academic commun- ity but for the ordinary citizen as well. The diffi- culty of my task has both an objective and a subjective basis. Objectively, it is particularly hard to address an audience composed of dis- tinguished fellow physicists and equally distin- guished nonscientists. The speaker will constantly navigate between the Scylla of triviality and the Charybdis of incomprehensibility - probably not steering clear of either. Subjectively, it is a great burden to be introduced in the Fermilab as the Fermi Professor from the Enrico Fermi Institute. This constitutes triple jeopardy, to say the least. Why then did I accept this assignment? First, because I feel that belonging to the American Academy is not only an honor but a commit- ment to communicate. Second, because I want to convince you that all the technical marvels of this laboratory are nothing but tools in our quest to find simplicity and harmony in nature, a quest which must be based on precise and reliable experimental evidence. Third, because no one- in particular not an experimenter working in this Laboratory - can refuse anything to Bob Wilson. To define our terms, let us consider the equi- lateral triangle which is meant to symbolize a conceptual cycle in physics (or in any other natural science for that matter). We start from the bottom of this magic triangle, moving counterclockwise. Theory Prediction Paradox Experiment / \ Experiment Prejudice 25</page><page sequence="2">At any given time we have a "prejudice" about some given class of physical phenomena. This prejudice is the intellectualization of past phe- nomena: it may be a hunch, a qualitative theory or an exact mathematical statement about rela- tions between various measurable quantities, per- haps venerable enough to be called a "law of nature." At some point (symbolized by the right-hand corner), an experimental result is obtained which, within the framework of cur- rent knowledge, i.e., prejudice, constitutes a para- dox. Next, a new theory is framed (apex) which reconciles the new result with the body of earlier established facts. The new theory must then be able to make predictions which can stand the acid test of experiment (left-hand bottom corner). The more numerous the predictions verified by experiment, and the fewer the un- verified or unverifiable ones, the faster this theory becomes the new prejudice." By further experi- mentation - Galileo's "prova e riprova" - gen- erally by means of radically novel, previously unavailable tools, one often discovers new para- doxes and runs through the whole cycle again. The challenge of physics lies in the ambivalent expectation that the cycle never really stops or, alternatively, that it leads to the one "grand formula" which explains at least all of inanimate nature. This latter alternative appears to some of us as the dream of the senile theorist. From the pragmatic point of view, no grand formula can explain what has not yet been experimentally investigated - phenomena too small for our microscopes, too energetic for our accelerators, or too slow on the time scale of the human race. I should state, as a warning, that the use of the word "prejudice" in this context may be some- what misleading. After each conceptual cycle, many of the aspects of concepts are generally retained. The newer theories often contain the older ones as limiting cases, while the older ones frequently continue to serve a purpose if one remembers the right caveats. In view of the foregoing analysis, it is not an 26</page><page sequence="3">accident that the basis of the triangle is spanned by two experiments or sets of experiments. How- ever, as a concession to the theorists, the apex of the triangle is a conceptual insight. Finally, for those who wish to see the will of the Creator in this rather infernal cycle, a modified version of the triangle consists in drawing an eye inside it. To illustrate the conceptual cycles in physics, I have chosen the following examples: A. Prejudice: Macroscopic laws are valid on a microscopic scale. This prejudice, sometimes summarized as "classical physics," reigned towards the end of the nineteenth century. Although J. Bernouilli, the father of "kinetic theory," i.e., the man who first tried to explain the macroscopic properties of gases in terms of molecular collisions, and J. M. Ampere, the genius who attributed the properties of permanent magnets to molecular currents, were early precursors, the true author of this prejudice was the great Dutch physicist, H. A. Lorentz. Maxwell synthesized all known facts of electricity and magnetism, as observed with macroscopic objects, into a compact set of a few equations. The culmination of Maxwell's theory was the prediction that electromagnetic waves propagate with the velocity of light, a prediction quickly verified by the experiments of Hertz. Thus optics became a chapter of elec- tromagnetism. Maxwell had modelled his theory after that of elasticity, one of the few mathematically de- veloped subjects of his youth. Hence his equa- tions contained a few "empirical parameters" (dielectric constant, conductivity, etc.) to be fixed experimentally, just as such parameters (tensile strength, shear modulus, etc.) enter the equations of elasticity. The case of "naked" charges and currents in the vacuum which was of little practical interest was handled by con- sidering the vacuum, then called the ether, as a special medium endowed with its own pseudo- elastic properties. 27</page><page sequence="4">Lorentz, especially after the discovery of the electron by his own analysis of Zeeman's experi- ments and, independently, by J. J. Thompson, set himself the task of explaining, in a funda- mental way, the electromagnetic properties of macroscopic objects, i.e., Maxwell's empirical parameters. He made the brilliant hypothesis- now the apex of our magic triangle - that Max- well's laws governing charges and currents in the vacuum applied on the microscopic scale, inside the then hypothetical atoms and mole- cules. With suitable models for the latter and appropriate averages over their arrangement and orientation, the properties of macroscopic ob- jects became understandable - or almost. Lorentz' approach met with much success, especially in the field of optics where his der- ivations, just slightly retouched, are taught to this day. Particularly impressive was his inter- pretation of the influence of an external magnetic field upon the spectral lines emitted by atoms, the so-called Zeeman effect. (In retrospect, Zee- man must have chosen accidentally one of those few atomic species to which classical theory applies!) Lorentz' "theory of electrons" was sufficiently successful to become a "prejudice." One of the applications of electron theory con- cerned the explanation of electrical conductivity. Whereas in insulators the electrons were imag- ined to be bound to the constituent molecules or atoms, in metals some of them were imagined to move freely, but not quite, between the constituents. An external electric field in the form of a voltage applied to the conductor would impose a preferred direction over the random motions of this "electron gas," and an electric current would flow. The linear relation- ship between current and voltage, known as Ohm's law, was readily understandable in terms of collisional losses. This picture, aside from provoking the ob- vious question of what makes sodium a metal and sulphur an insulator, met with a formidable paradox. It was a well-known fact, and indeed 28</page><page sequence="5">strong evidence for the reality of atoms, that most substances (insulators, metals, even gases) have the same specific heat/mole. It takes the same amount of heat to produce a temperature increase of i in 4 grams of helium gas (at con- stant volume) as it does to warm I80 grams of gold. Why then did this "electron gas" within a metal not take up thermal energy and hence contribute to its specific heat, roughly doubling it? One would have imagined that the increas- ingly intense vibrations of the lattice would heat up the electrons, just as the walls of a container warm a gas contained therein. In some sense the answer to this question lies in raising harder ones: why are atoms so rigid and hard to excite? What determines the actual size of atoms? Bohr answered these questions in 1912 with a set of postulates which imply a radical modifica- tion of classical models for atoms, i.e., a total abandonment of the "Lorentz prejudice." Not- withstanding its brilliant successes, Bohr's atomic model left many problems for true quantum mechanics, as we accept it today, to solve. One of these was the origin of the periodic system of chemical elements. This paradox was solved, just before the advent of quantum mechanics, by Pauli who postulated that at most two elec- trons can occupy the same orbit (the same energy level) in an atom-the exclusion prin- ciple. At the 1927 Como Conference, Heisenberg introduced Pauli and Fermi to each other with these words: "The exclusion principle - and its applications." A few months after Pauli's paper appeared, Fermi had, in fact, first applied the exclusion principle to an assembly of quasi-free atoms, i.e., to a gas. Thus did he provide - at least indirectly - the solution for the specific heat paradox discussed earlier. Contrary to what is frequently stated, Fermi was not concerned with an "electron gas," al- though this is commonly called a "Fermi gas" today. He desperately tried to find an applica- tion of his ideas to real gases. Fermi argued as 29</page><page sequence="6">follows: Let the atoms be confined to a given volume not by the usual rigid walls (an "infi- nitely steep potential") but by a weak harmonic restoring force (spring or "parabolic potential") originating at the center of the volume. The energy levels of such a system - i.e., the possible vibrational frequencies of the atoms - are readily calculated by Bohr's rules. The levels are then filled up, according to Pauli's principle, with all the N atoms confined in the given volume V; the filling clearly depends on the particle den- sity, N/V, we consider. Regular filling, without holes and promotions, i.e., without excitations, corresponds to perfectly cold gas - a gas which paradoxically still contains mostly very energetic atoms! Heating up the gas means exciting vibrations, that is, promoting atoms from lower to higher levels. But in the perfectly cold (p.c.) gas, only those in the top level can be promoted up to vacant levels - a vanishingly small fraction. Thus the p.c. Fermi gas cannot be excited; it has zero specific heat. At finite temperature T, a small group of levels, of width kT, is partially occupied. We have now reached the solution of the paradox. The electron gas in a metal is very dense (io,ooo times more than a normal gas) and acts like an almost p.c. Fermi gas, although its "top" electrons have energies corresponding to io5 degrees! Under usual conditions, it con- tributes very little to the specific heat of a metal. Pauli and Fermi did not provide this solution; it was suggested by Sommerfeld. Among many other things, this picture fails to provide even a hint about the origins of superconductivity. Since nuclei contain even more nucleons/cm3 than the "electron gas" in metals, they provide another instance of a p.c. Fermi gas (actually, a mixture of p.c. neutron and proton gases). It is a curious circumstance that Maria Goeppert- Mayer solved the mystery of the periodic sys- tem of nuclei (magic numbers) by using the parabolic picture employed by Fermi as her starting point. 30</page><page sequence="7">The ultimate example of the p.c. Fermi gas is a macroscopic chunk (!) of nuclear matter of high density. Dilute nuclear matter exists in many stars, and gravitational collapse makes them evolve tow-ard higher densities. Ultimately, they can, under the right conditions, evolve into a Fermi gas of neutrons. This possibility was quantitatively explored by Oppenheimer and Volkoff in 1937, and pulsars are now currently identified as "neutron stars." In this account, I have purposely omitted many other experimental paradoxes which forced us to abandon the "Lorentz prejudice." I just wanted to show how a "minor anomaly" in solid state physics can, via nuclear physics, lead us right to heaven. B. Prejudice: The only forces in the world are electromagnetic and gravitational. The Rutherford-Bohr picture of the atom is similar to that of the solar system, the nucleus playing the role of the sun, the electrons that of the planets, with electrical attraction replac- ing gravity. M\odified by quantum mechanics, this picture and its extensions to molecules, has been overwhelmingly successful. To quote Dirac (1929): "It explains all of chemistry and most of physics." The prejudice that electromagnetism, in con- junction with quantum mechanics, explains al- most all of physics was shortlived. The properties of atomic nuclei presented obvious paradoxes. Nuclei are very small and contain a very large density of positive charge. From their mass, it is reasonable to assume that they consist at least in part of protons. Considering the enormous electric repulsion between protons at small dis- tances, it is paradoxical that most nuclei do not explode. (It is the electrostatic repulsion which provides the "nuclear" energx- released in fis- sion!) Early attempts to bind the protons by intranuclear electrons failed and led to additional paradoxes. With the experimental discovery of the neu- 31</page><page sequence="8">tron, the uncharged counterpart of the proton, the paradox of nuclear stability was explained: Nucleons (i.e., neutrons and/or protons) attract each other at short distances by a very strong force of hitherto unknown kind, the "nuclear force." The binding due to this force largely overshadows the repulsion among protons and is the source of "nuclear energy." Another entirely different paradox presented by nuclei is beta radioactivity. MLany nuclear species decay spontaneously with the emission of an electron, producing a daughter nucleus with a charge one unit greater than the parent. Neither electromagnetism nor the nuclear forces can account for this phenomenon. However, it is possible intuitively to interpret this radio- activity as the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron. W hat are the predictions of a theory invok- ing nuclear forces? The most obvious one is that Rutherford's experiments, if done with suf- ficient care, should show deviations from "pure Coulomb scattering." Newton's results for the solar system, based on the I/r' law of universal gravitation, implied: (a) elliptical orbits for the (bound) planets and (b) hyperbolical orbits for the (unbound) comets. In the case of two equally charged objects, the elliptical orbits dis- appear, but the hyperbolic orbits remain such. Rutherford's scattering experiments showed essentially that positive projectiles (alpha parti- cles) were deflected by nuclei on hyperbolic orbits. If we shoot two protons at each other, their distance of closest approach will be determined by their initial energy of relative motion. At the distance of closest approach (d.c.a.) the protons are "stopped" by the Coulomb repulsion. The scattering is modified if the d.c.a. falls within the range of nuclear forces, that is, at sufficiently high proton energies! Superficially, the result appears as a modification of the laws of electro- magnetism at high energies; it is for this reason that the first experiments on proton-proton 32</page><page sequence="9">scattering (1935) were funded at the Carnegie Institution for Terrestrial Magnetism. Since 1935, experiments on proton-proton scattering, and their variations with other projectiles and tar- gets, have never ceased. It is perhaps fair to say that 10-25 percent of the experiments at any high-energy laboratory are at all times devoted to Rutherford's old trick in some form or other. The incident or projectile energy has increased by a factor 3.10o in forty years. Nucleon-nucleon scattering experiments are performed primarily to learn about nuclear forces. Electron-nucleon scattering, an even closer analog of Rutherford's experiment, was and is being done to gain information about the charge distribution inside nucleons. Such experiments have yielded remarkable paradoxes which I will discuss later. Vhen nucleons are made to collide at suffi- ciently high energies, of the order of a few hundred MeV (or, in today's parlance, a few tenths of a GeV), an entirely new type of particle, the pi meson or pion, is created in some of the collisions. For the first time in history it is possible to create in the laboratory an entirely new kind of matter-a feat far surpassing al- chemy which merely sought to produce known matter (gold) from other known matter. Mesons are unfortunately unstable, i.e., radioactive, but it would be an amusing fantas- to think of collect- ing them in boxes as mesic atoms and building up a new brand of macroscopic matter! The discover- of meson production was not a paradox in the sense in which we have used this expression up to now. Pions were, in fact, predicted soon after the establishment of nuclear forces by the Japanese physicist, Yukawa, who set out to explain these strong, shortranged forces in a fundamental way. He assumed that they arise in close analogy' with electromagnetic interactions. The latter, in a quantum picture, arise from the exchange of photons between anv two charged particles. In this picture, the long- range electrical forces (I/r2) are connected with 33</page><page sequence="10">the massless nature of the field particles, i.e., the photons. W-hat Yukawa essentially postulated was the existence of heavy photons: the mesons. These are exchanged between the nucleons; thus the nucleons are the sources of the nuclear field and the mesons its quanta. A novel aspect is that these quanta need not be neutral but can have + unit electrical charges. In fact, all three kinds of pions were produced. The enormous success of Yukawa's predictions created a new regime of prejudice. Nuclear forces could be understood through point-like mesons and nucleons, and the detailed study of "mesodynamics" was to be the last step. An obvious experiment was to study the scat- tering of pions by nucleons. The Chicago cyclo- tron (0.45 GeV) was the first truly intense source of pions; and it was used for such studies by Fermi, Anderson, and their collaborators. Very soon the! discovered an interesting para- do.: the occurrence of particularly strong scat- tering around a certain energy of the incident pion beam. In fact, they had discovered the first excited state of the nucleon. Thus this "elemen- tary particle" revealed itself to be quite complex. Subsequently, as the available energy increased, many other excited states were discovered and nucleon spectroscopv became a recognized field of scientific endeavor. Increasing energy also meant that more and more new mesons of ever increasing masses were discovered. A particularly striking discovery was that of excited states of mesons with a spectroscopy all their own. Clearly, the prejudice of a simplistic division into source and field particles had to be abandoned. W\'e now know of mesons which are heavier than the nucleon! Remarkable symmetries among members of sets of barvons and mesons were uncovered by the spectroscopists. Gell-Mann won the Nobel Prize for proposing a symmetry scheme that amounts to predicting a "periodic system of ele- mentar! (.) particles." Like Pauli in his pre- dictions, Gell-.lann used abstract mathematical 34</page><page sequence="11">rules instead of a mechanical model, although he, and independently Zweig, later suggested one. Mesons and baryons, because thcv exert strong forces on each other, are now jointly called hadrons. The key question is: Is there a single, hadronic 7matter of which all these particles are made? Fermi, together with his collaborator, Yang, was the pioneer in this area as well. While the field/source dichotomy of pions/nucleons was at its peak of popular acceptance (= prejudice), they suggested that one might think of the pion as a bound system of nucleon and antinucleon, thus eliminating pions as "fundamental." Today's version of this picture is that mesons consist of bound "quark-antiquark" pairs and baryons of three "quarks." The most convenient picture assigns n/3 (fractional) charges to these hypothetical constitutents where n is one or two. Many experimental facts support the quark model, and it is rapidly developing into a prejudice. The fundamental unity of hadronic matter as seen empirically can be explained as follows. The probabilit- that two colliding particles scatter or produce further particles is generally ex- pressed as a "cross-section." This probability is a function of the energ- of relative motion of the two particles. Since all hadron-hadron inter- actions are to be understood as quark-quark interactions, these cross-sections should be pro- portional to the numbers of quarks contained in the two colliding particles. Thus proton-proton (3 quarks each) cross-sections should be 3/2 larger than meson (2 quarks) -proton cross- sections. This is borne out b- experiment; although the cross-sections vary with energy, their ratio stays essentially 3:2. If one plots the masses of barvons or mesons as a function of their observed spins (rotational excited states), the representative points are all on straight lines. The straichmess of these "trajectories" and their similar slopes for mesons and baryons speak well for universality. 35</page><page sequence="12">The current paradox is that quarks have never been produced, i.e., observed outside matter. The current prejudice is that this mystic confine- ment within particles can be explained in the framework of conventional quantum mechanics. Let's w%ait for the next paradox. C. Prejudice: The equivalence of right and left in microscopic laws. One of the earliest anthropomorphic preju- dices overcome in formulating physical laws was omission of the distinction between "right" and "left." Most of us have our hearts on the left side of our chests, and most of us, especially Europeans, write with our right hand. Although we clearly recognize "right" and "left" as antonyms, we still feel that we can distinguish them in an absolute sense, say w ith reference to our bodies. A little reflection shows that this is not so. If there was a planet which was object by object a mirror image of our own, we could not determine this by a long-distance call to its inhabitants. Everytime we asked them to fabri- cate a right-handed screw they could make a left-handed one, or vice versa. It was thus assumed that the laws of physics, in particular those governing the microscopic world, were "mirror invariant." Their mathe- matical formulation contained no trace of hand- edness. Basically, it was assumed that ordinary physicists and physicists who always observe the world through mirrors tied to their eyes would derive the same laws. Thinking about micro- scopic physics as the interaction of pointlike particles (unorientable) in a vacuum (isotropic) makes this interpretation quite natural. Thus Lorentz' microscopic theory of matter and its quantum extensions, as well as the theory of nuclear forces, were mirror-invariant. The immense success of these predictive theories gen- erated the prejudice that not only electromag- netic and strong but all "conceivable" inter- actions had to possess this property. The reversal of this prejudice occurred in 36</page><page sequence="13">1956 through a paradox involving the radioactive decay of some heavv mesons, today called kaons. This paradox, which I shall not describe and analyze here, was noted bv the Australian physi- cist, Dalitz, and analyzed by Lee and Yang. Since kaons are studied in high-energy physics, this field can take credit for one of the deepest con- ceptual revolutions in physics. It was implicit, but not stressed, in what was said above that the radioactive decay in question is not caused by electromagnetic or strong inter- actions. As noted in the previous section, the well known radioactivity of certain nuclear species, consisting in electron emission, can be attributed (and it was first done so by Fermi) to the decay of a neutron into a proton: the process n - p -+ e (fS-decay). The reaction, as written above, is impossible on several grounds. First, if it were true, the electrons would have a single fixed energy, whereas they are observed to display a continuous spectrum up to a max- imum given by that fixed energy (endpoint). Second, angular momentum would not be con- served (all particles have half-integral spins). The concept of the massless light quantum, or photon, was introduced by Einstein in order to account for energy and momentum conservation in microscopic processes involving light. Simi- larly, Pauli proposed to salvage these laws by postulating that an "invisible" massless (or at least very light) particle, v - neutrino, always accompanies electrons in beta decay: n p + e+v The energy sharing between electron and neu- trino could account for the observed continuous energy spectrum of the decay electrons. It was again Fermi who formulated a quantita- tive theory of this process. In framing his theory, he was guided, like Yukawa, by electromagnetic phenomena in which a photon is suddenly created. A suitable combination of electron and neutrino waves mimicked the electromagnetic field. A "weak charge," almost but not quite analogous to the electric charge, governed the 37</page><page sequence="14">ease with which these "pseudophotons" were emitted. Lord Rutherford once said, "On the scale of nuclear phenomena, beta decay hardly ever occurs." In fact, neutrons decay with a mean life of about ooo seconds, -whereas nuclear phenomena require on the order of lo-'2 sec- onds! Thus we speak of "weak" or "slow" decays, attributing them to "weak interactions" of which neutron beta decay is but the proto- type. In fact, all particles discovered to date participate in weak interactions, although the effect of the latter is often overshadowed by strong or electromagnetic processes. The fact that Fermi's theory mimicked elec- tromagnetism automatically implied that it was a mirror-invariant theory. Unmotivated by ex- perimental evidence, Fermi no doubt followed Newton's "hypotheses non fingo": I make no needless extra assumptions. A consequence of a mirror-invariant theory is that it cannot predict the spontaneous creation of preferentially handed microscopic objects. If, in the absence of an external influence like a coil, atoms spontaneously emitted right circu- larly polarized light (right-handed photons), then there would be an absolute, microscopic standard of handedness, and a breakdown of mirror invariance. Lee and Yang recognized the implicit preju- dice of all pre-I956 theories of weak inter- actions. They were aware that the mirror- invariant form of the equations falsely antici- pated the negative results of experiments which had actually never been performed! In particular, they emphasized that in sixty years of nuclear electron decay not one experiment had been performed that could have revealed some pref- erential handedness. Then they proceeded to suggest crucial tests of mirror invariance. These tests were performed within six months and showed maximal violation of the once hallowed notion of reflection symmetry. Technically, this discoverx- is known as "the breakdown of parity conservation." 38</page><page sequence="15">In conceptual terms, the simplest tests always involved spinning particles, either (a) as decay products, like the ordinary electrons of B-decay or heavy electrons (muons) in pion decay or (b) as the radioactive parent particle, like the neutron in the fundamental process we men- tioned. The first type of experiment (although not the first to be done) consisted in investigating whether a-decay electrons spin in a preferential way with respect to their velocities, i.e., whether they are polarized. They were found to be ioo% polarized, all spinning left: left-handed negative electrons! An "absolute standard" of handedness. Consider next the decay of a polarized parti- cle, a neutron (or a nucleus) or a muon. Polar- ized particles are obtained by aligning their spins by means of a magnetic field, say, a flat coil. They now all spin in one way about the axis of the coil. W\hen the decay is observed, one finds that more decay products come out above the plane (defined with respect to the magnetic field) than below. So again an "absolute" stand- ard of handedness is obtained, in terms of the handedness of the current-carrying coil. (It is not the field that produces the asymmetry since, as the nuclei stay polarized, one may switch the current off! One just has to remember. which way it went before it was switched off.) The experiment seems to violate even the principle of "sufficient cause," or Occam's razor. Mirroring (in the plane of the coil) leaves the initial situation (coil plus nucleus) unchanged, but not the final one. It turns out that a kind of mirror invariance can be preserved not bv com- paring a given situation and its mirror image but by comparing the mirror image and the same situation involving antimatter: e.g., the decay of antineutrons into antiprotons, positrons (antielectrons), and neutrinos. If the polarized neutron decays preferentially above the plane, the antineutron decays preferentially below it with the same distribution. The electrons (posi- trons) are left (right) handed. Thus nature 39</page><page sequence="16">appears invariant under the joint operation of ordinary mirroring ,znd particle-antiparticle in- terchange, a motion now called PC invariance. We note, without detailed discussion, that Cronin, Fitch, and their collaborators have, in an isolated case, demonstrated that even this in- variance (a new prejudice) ma- break down. All weak processes, e.g., the "transposition" p + v-- n +-e a reaction studied at Fermilab, break mirror in- variance. Prejudicc: this property is an even more profound characteristic of weak inter- actions than weakness. As the research at Fermi- lab indicates, weakness decreases as energy in- creases. Current theoretical attempts at unifica- tion of weak and electromagnetic interactions, otherwise promising, suffer from this fact. New paradoxes await us, and new prejudices will follow. 40</page></plain_text>
