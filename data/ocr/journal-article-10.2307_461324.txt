<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETHEL F. CORNWELL Samuel Beckett: The Flight from Self THE existential questions posed by Beckett's work and the "absurd" nature of his heroes and situations are clearly seen in dramatic pieces such as Waiting for Godot and Act with- out Words I &amp; II, but the problem at the heart of his writing-and best demonstrated in his novels and stories-is the existential necessity of self- creation. Only animals and objects are given a being, said Ortega in "Man the Technician." "The stone is given its existence," what it is, but man is given "the abstract possibility of existence," what he may or might be; his life is a "project," his being a "not-yet-being."' Of our contemporary writers none is more aware of this than Beckett, and none more fearful of the "project." The Beckett hero is crushed by the burden of consciousness, out of which comes that self-responsibility he would like to escape but cannot. He has neither a god to assume it for him, nor the courage to escape through self-destruction-which he yearns for perpetually. His life is one long ambivalence be- tween the desire for and fear of its termination, one long attempt to reverse the process of birth and speed his return to the state of pre-conscious nonbeing from which he came; that is his lost Eden. The Beckett hero does not seek his identity, he flees from it; his quest is for anonymity, for self-annihilation. And it is always the same hero, always the same story. "I have my faults," says the Unnamable, "but changing my tune is not one of them." When Moran refers to himself as a man "exiled in his manhood," what he means is that one's existence as a man is a kind of exile.2 And what Molloy regrets, what he wishes to return to, is the prenatal unconsciousness he enjoyed in the womb, the lost Eden from which he was expelled.3 Other Beckett heroes feel similarly exiled and long for what D. H. Lawrence called "the paradisal unknowing."4 To this end the Beckett character consumes "pain-killers" to deaden awareness and lessen the agony of consciousness; or, like Krapp, turns to booze, sex, and sleep, dreaming of a past 41 time when he could lose himself in the arms of a woman. That Beckett considers the problem a universal one is indicated again and again. Flung from his father's home and condemned to exile for no rea- son he can understand, the hero of "The Ex- pelled" says, "I don't know why I told this story. I could just as well have told another. Living souls, you will see how alike they are."5 And when Mr. Slocum asks ("All That Fall"), "May I offer you a lift, Mrs. Rooney? Are you going in my direction ?" she replies, "I am, Mr. Slocum, we all are." Where they are going is from birth to death, a journey from nothing to nothing; that is what makes the journey (and the task of self-creation) so pointless. Mr. Rooney dreams wistfully of "another home" elsewhere, but when his wife speaks of pressing on till they reach "heaven," he accuses her of "struggling with a dead language."6 Without hope of heaven, or of any hereafter, the Beckett hero travels in a meaningless circle back to where he started. As Beckett suggests in the Addenda to Watt, it is simply a matter of the long way of the short stay of the going back home the way he had come (p. 250) The inevitable question of course is: if life is so meaningless, and self-creation such an effort, why go on living? A question the Beckett hero repeat- edly asks himself, but never answers. He simply retreats from the physical world into the inner recesses of the mind, from which there is no way out, as Beckett's later heroes discover. The various stages of the retreat, and the results of it, are best seen in Murphy, Three Novels, Stories and Texts for Nothing, and How It Is. In them one finds a progressive flight from self-identity-from Murphy, Molloy, Moran, Malone to a series of "Unnamables"-and a progressive shift in tone from humor to desperation. Murphy, Beckett's first novel and his second</page><page sequence="2">Samuel Beckett.: The Flight from Self work of fiction, not only demonstrates the fears and attitudes typical of the Beckett hero, but offers an actual map of the mental region to which that hero eventually retires. Echoing Geulincx, a seventeenth-century Cartesian, Murphy decides that one's only freedom is in the mind, which is also the only area one can control; therefore, one should concentrate on the mental sphere and ignore the outside world, where freedom and con- trol are impossible. And the outside world, of course, includes the body, for Murphy regards mind and body'as two separate worlds never to be united, though they may collide or cooperate at times. Thus Murphy felt himself split in two, a body and a mind. They had intercourse apparently, otherwise he could not have known that they had anything in com- mon. But he felt his mind to be bodytight and did not understand through what channel the intercourse was effected nor how the two experiences came to overlap. He was satisfied that neither followed from the other. He neither thought a kick because he felt it nor felt a kick because he thought one.7 It occurs to Murphy that some third force may effect the "partial congruence" of the two worlds, but the problem is not sufficiently interesting for him to pursue it. Any solution would do that did not clash with the feel- ing, growing stronger as Murphy grew older, that his mind was a closed system, subject to no principle of change but its own, self-sufficient and impermeable to the vicissitudes of the body. (p. 109) Murphy envies the inmates of The Magdalen Mental Mercyseat (and is willing to care for them) because of their "self-immersed indifference to the contingencies of the contingent world"; this is the condition "which he had chosen for himself as the only felicity and achieved so seldom" (p. 168). The attempt to cure the patients by bridging the gulf between the inner and the outer world is revolting to Murphy, "whose experience as a physical and rational being obliged him to call sanctuary what the psychiatrists called exile and to think of the patients not as banished from a system of benefits but as escaped from a colossal fiasco" (pp. 177-78). Murphy has long wished to escape from "the big world" into "the little world" and live entirely in the mind, which he conceives "not as an instru- ment but as a place"; but like his predecessor, Belacqua, Murphy is continually drawn back into "the big world" by the demands of his body, "his deplorable susceptibility to Celia, ginger, and so on" (pp. 178-79). Not until he sees the enviable lot of the inmates is Murphy able to turn his back on Celia and make his withdrawal. For Murphy, the cells of the inmates represent "indoor bowers of bliss" (p. 181), symbolizing not only that retreat he himself desires, but the actual part of the mind he wishes to retreat to. Within the narrow limits of domestic architecture he had never been able to imagine a more creditable representation of what he kept on calling, indefatig- ably, the little world. (p. 181) This "little world" Murphy visualizes as a kind of cell, "a large hollow sphere, hermetically closed to the universe without" (p. 107). Within it, there are "three zones, light, half light, dark, each with its specialty" (p. 111). In the first there are "the forms with parallel" in the outside world, "the elements of physical experience available for a new arrangement. Here the pleasure was reprisal, the pleasure of reversing experience. Here the kick the physical Murphy received, the mental Murphy gave" (p. 111). In the second zone are "the forms without parallel." Here the pleasure is "contemplation," "the Belacqua bliss" (p. 111). The third zone, the dark, is characterized by "a flux of forms, a perpetual coming together and falling asunder of forms" (p. 112). In the first two zones, Murphy feels "sovereign and free, in the one to requite himself, in the other to move as he pleased," but in the third he is motionless, "a mote in the dark of absolute freedom" (p. 112). The pleasures of the first two zones are nothing to "the sensation of being a missile without prove- nance or target, caught up in a tumult of non- Newtonian motion" (p. 113). The problem is that the "mental Murphy" can- not make his escape until the "physical Murphy" is appeased. He was split, one part of him never left this mental chamber that pictured itself as a sphere full of light fading into dark, because there was no way out. But motion in this world depended on rest in the world out- side. (p. 110) Hence Murphy sits in his rocking chair and rocks until his body is virtually numb, "for it was not 42</page><page sequence="3">Ethel F. Cornwell until his body was appeased that he could come alive in his mind" (p. 2). The zone of light (which has contact with, and parallel forms in, the outside world) he pictures as above, on the surface of the mind, the light be- coming increasingly dim as he submerges to the dark zone beneath the other two. And it is the dark zone that appeals to him most. Thus as his body set him free more and more in his mind, he took to spending less and less time in the light, sitting at the breakers of the world; and less in the half light, where the choice of bliss introduced an element of effort; and more and more and more in the dark, in the will-lessness, a mote in its absolute freedom. (p. 113) What Murphy seeks is a kind of oblivion. The appeal of the dark zone is that it offers the greatest possible freedom from desire, the greatest possible release from external reality and individual con- sciousness this side of death. Only in Murphy do we find an explicit analysis of the three zones, but Beckett's works are, in effect, a progression-or regression-from the first zone to the third one. The key to Beckett's work lies in Murphy, but it is in the trilogy Molloy; Malone Dies; The Unnamable that the progression is made clear. It is also here that we first see the face behind the masks, the ventriloquist behind his dummies. On the surface there seems to be little connec- tion between the stories in part I and part II of Molloy. In part X we find Molloy in his mother's bedroom apparently waiting to die. Each day he is given fresh sheets of paper upon which he is obliged to write his story: to recount the trials and tribulations of a past journey during which he tried unsuccessfully to get back to his mother, his progress slowing and his disabilities increasing, until at last he was reduced to crawling, and sank into a ditch from which he was miraculously rescued (he doesn't know how or by whom) and presumably brought to his mother's room, where he is now. Part II begins with a report Moran is obliged to write concerning a vague mission he was sent on, one he never quite understood and never com- pleted (to find Molloy). One Sunday in summer, Gaber had appeared with orders from Youdi, the head of a mysterious agency, and Moran was given his "mission," or what he thought was his mis- sion: to find a man he had never seen and whose whereabouts he did not know. The resulting journey in search of Molloy continued painfully and pointlessly until Gaber suddenly appeared and ordered him home, where Moran now writes his report. Aside from the fact that Molloy is the object of Moran's vague search, there is no connection between the two plots. What actually unites the two parts of Molloy and the three novels of the trilogy is a submerged hero, their common creator. But it is not until the second novel, Malone Dies, that we discover Molloy and Moran to be fictions of Malone, who is in turn, as we dis- cover in the third book, an invention of the un- namable "I." What further links the stories of Molloy and Moran is that both are compelled to write a report (one must account for his life), and their report is of a journey; the journey we all make from birth to death; that progression from non- being to nonbeing which is no progression at all, but a regression, a return to one's origin. Molloy's heroic struggles to get back to his mother reflect his desire to return to the womb, or more specif- ically to the pre-conscious state from which his birth wrenched him. So much does Molloy regret having been born, he bitterly resents the woman who thrust him into the world. The best he can say of her is: I don't think too harshly of her. I know she did all she could not to have me, except of course the one thing, and if she never succeeded in getting me unstuck, it was that fate had earmarked me for less compassionate sewers. But it was well-meant and that's enough for me. No it is not enough for me, but I give her credit, though she is my mother, for what she tried to do for me. And I forgive her for having jostled me a little in the first month and spoiled the only endurable, just endurable, period of my enormous history. (Molloy, p. 18) Death is to be desired because it reverses the act of birth, returning one to a condition of pre- consciousness. Never in any of his writing does Beckett consider death a rebirth. In fact, Malone's chief fear, as he lies dying, is that he may already be dead and that death has given him no release from consciousness, no escape from being. Moran, suffering from a local paralysis, wishfully con- templates the pleasures of total paralysis, with "just enough brain intact to allow you to exult! 43</page><page sequence="4">44 Samuel Beckett. And to dread death like a regeneration" (Molloy, p. 140). And Murphy concludes that raising Lazarus from the dead was "perhaps the one occa- sion on which the Messiah had overstepped the mark" (Murphy, p. 180). The concept of death as a reversal is found throughout Beckett's writing and is suggested in various ways. During the final stages of his "journey," Molloy's physical disabilities increase to such an extent that he is reduced to crawling; and, lying in his mother's bedroom, where he was born, he pacifies himself with "sucking stones," suggesting a return to infancy. That one goes back the way he came is further suggested by the description of Malone's death, which literally be- comes a "birth into death." Malone feels that he is swelling, that he is about to burst. The ceiling rises and falls, rises and falls, rhythmically, as when I was a foetus. Also to be mentioned a noise of rushing water ... I am being given, if I may venture the expression, birth into death, such is my impression. (Malone Dies, p. 283) The rejection of life and the desire for its op- posite is emphasized by the way Beckett's char- acters attempt to speed their regressive journey. During the last stage of their journey, Mr. Rooney ("All That Fall") suggests to his wife, "Shall we go on backwards now a little?" (Krapp's Last Tape, p. 74). And the hero of Watt not only walks backward, he dons his clothes "back to front," and eventually speaks backward as well, reversing word order and spelling (Watt, p. 162). The religious nature of the problem, and the ensuing rebellion, is indicated by Moran, who, unlike Beckett's other characters, begins as one of the faithful, obediently attending mass each Sunday, and blindly following the orders of his unseen master (Gaber, the messenger of Youdi suggesting Gabriel, the messenger of Yahweh- and significantly the messenger arrives on a Sunday). Moran's reward is a "mission" that is vague, incomprehensible, and pointless, arbi- trarily begun at midnight and just as arbitrarily terminated-and a journey entailing all the miseries suffered by Beckett's other characters. Until at last Moran rebels, protesting the very nature of his existence. Essentially, Moran's story is a commentary on what Mr. Rooney called the "dead language" of Christianity, of religion in general, and it is The Flight from Self significant that Moran fares no better than the unbelievers. What frustrates him (illustrating the predicament of man) is that he, a rational crea- ture, finds himself thrust into an irrational world- for no purpose he can fathom. He would like to end his life and escape it all, but that of course is an outlet his religion forbids him. During the last leg of his homeward journey, Moran amuses himself by posing "certain ques- tions of a theological nature." He begins some- what facetiously. "Did the serpent crawl or, as Comestor affirms, walk upright?" "Does nature observe the sabbath?" he asks. "What was God doing with himself before the creation?" Moving to his own concerns, Moran wonders what would happen if he saw Youdi. "What would I explain to him? I would crave his forgiveness. Forgive- ness for what?" And at last, coming to the ques- tion that obsesses him: "What would I do until my death? Was there no means of hastening this, without falling into a state of sin?" (Molloy, pp. 166-68). As his rebelliousness increases, we find Moran rejecting the notion of an anthropomorphic deity. Speculating about his bees, he comments, "I would never do to my bees the wrong I had done my God, to whom I had been taught to ascribe my angers, fears, desires, and even my body" (p. 169). But the loss of an anthropomorphic deity leaves one solely and completely responsible for oneself, and we are back where we started: with that burden of selfhood which the Beckett character tries so desperately to escape, deadening the body and retreating to the mind, only to discover, like Moran, that the destruction of his outer self in- creases his awareness of the inner one. As Moran nears home he becomes physically less and less recognizable, yet: I not only knew who I was, but I had a sharper and clearer sense of my identity than ever before, in spite of its deep lesions and the wounds with which it was covered. And from this point of view I was less fortu- nate than my other acquaintances. (p. 170) And at last Moran declares flatly, "I have been a man long enough, I shall not put up with it any more, I shall not try any more" (p. 175). Neverthe- less he goes into the house and writes his report, as ordered. "It is midnight," he begins. "The rain is beating on the windows." Then he adds, "It was not midnight. It was not raining" (p. 176), suggest-</page><page sequence="5">Ethel F. Cornwell ing that the whole account is fiction, or that Moran is deliberately falsifying it as a protest against his senseless "mission" and the miseries it entailed. In Malone Dies the hero retreats one step further and his ambivalence increases. Malone lies in bed in what he decides is an ordinary house, not a hospital. He does not know how he got there, only that he is waiting to die. Periodically an old woman fills his soup bowl and empties his chamber pot. Near the end he has a visitor whose apparent aim is "to bring me back to dying"-possibly a doctor who drags him back to consciousness just as he is about to escape (p. 268). Meanwhile, except for these minor interruptions, Malone spends the time telling himself stories so as to escape self-awareness and avoid watching himself die. The problem is that his quest for the "paradisal unknowing" is sometimes countered by a sudden desire "to know what I am doing, and why. So I near the goal I set myself in my young days and which prevented me from living. And on the threshold of being no more I succeed in being another" (p. 194). The self he succeeds in being is whatever char- acter he is inventing at the moment; in the present case, Sapo. "I slip into him, I suppose in the hope of learning something" (p. 226). What the reader learns, and shortly, is that the narrator, who refers to himself as "Malone" ("since that is what I am called now," p. 222), has invented all the other Beckett characters; they are his creatures, his fictions, and when he dies, "it will all be over with the Murphys, Merciers, Molloys, Morans and Malones" (p. 236). The suggestion that Malone himself is another fiction is later confirmed in The Unnamable, the last novel of the trilogy. Malone can never decide whether to be or not to be, to know or not to know. This ambivalence is typical of Beckett's characters, who, like the hero of "The End," lack "the courage to end or the strength to go on" (Stories and Texts, p. 72). "If I had the use of my body I would throw it out the window," says Malone. "But perhaps it is the knowledge of my impotence that emboldens me to that thought" (Malone Dies, p. 218). Malone indicates his ambivalence in yet another way, his concern for his possessions. One moment he tries to lose his identity in one of his charac- ters; and the next, he is clinging to the very things that establish it. For one's goods and possessions help define one's personality; this is why Mercier and Camier must rid themselves of their posses- sions before undertaking their journey, and why Moran discards various items of clothing as he nears home, his final destination: "Clothes that cleave so close to the body and are so to speak inseparable from it" (Molloy, p. 170). Both body and clothing help to establish one's identity (the very thing Malone wishes to escape), therefore both must be got rid of. As Malone's body disintegrates and he retreats deeper within his mind, he has such a sense of alienation from his body that he thinks of his feet as "much farther from me than all the rest, from my head I mean, for that is where I am fled."8 Soon he is in the position of Watt, whose with- drawal from the external world and rejection of his external self brought him to the point where he could no longer consider himself a man and spoke of himself as it. Eventually Malone's lack of self- identity becomes so great that he begins to feel he's never been born and will "therefore never get dead" (p. 225). But what matter whether I was born or not, have lived or not, am dead or merely dying, I shall go on doing as I have always done, not knowing what it is I do, nor who I am, nor where I am, nor if I am. (p. 226) With The Unnamable, the issues which emerged in Malone Dies now become an obsession, and the humor of Beckett's earlier works is lost in despera- tion, for Beckett's hero has backed himself into a corner from which there is no escape. In his at- tempt to escape being, he has fled from the body to the mind, only to be closeted with the very self (the "I," the "voice") he is so frantic to escape. Instead of lessening his self-consciousness, he has increased it, and the flight from self now becomes an obsession with self: Who, what am I? What is I? And relentlessly the voice answers: Nothing, until you create it. Beginning with Malone, the narrator becomes increasingly aware that his chief task in life (and perhaps his only one) is self-creation. But se1f- creation involves the increase, not the diminution, of self-awareness; hence his dilemma, for the burden of selfhood is more than he can bear. So he yearns for the womb, clings to the bed, ducks into boxes and jars (any womb-tomb symbol at hand), or conceals himself behind fictional char- acters, feeling guilty all the while, and fearful that, since he has failed to create himself, to give birth to his self, he will not be allowed to die. 45</page><page sequence="6">Samuel Beckett: The Flight from Self To be or not to be is the problem absorbing Malone, the Unnamable, and all of Beckett's later characters; and not merely the question of one's physical life or death, but whether to be an indi- vidual identity, whether or not to accept the burden of selfhood and undertake one's self- creation. In The Unnamable we find the hero on the borderline between the half light and the dark, veering now to one side, now to the other, and so alienated from his body that at times he thinks of himself as a mere blob of flesh, a ball, or some ele- mental creature like a worm. The setting of the novel is quite literally the interior of the narrator's skull.9 Here, within the confines of his skull, resides the nameless I, the inner voice he cannot escape. He imagines the place to be dim and vast, perhaps "twelve feet in diameter" (a kind of cell, similar to the "large hollow sphere" that enclosed Murphy's "little world"), and he likes to think that he occupies the center of it. Here, Molloy wheels about him "like a planet about its sun" (p. 295). Here are all "the beings, things, shapes, sounds, and lights with which my haste to speak has encumbered this place" (pp. 299-300). For he speaks constantly, searching "for the means to put an end to things." The search for the means to put an end to things, an end to speech, is what enables the discourse to con- tinue. (p. 299) He recognizes the necessity of being, of voicing himself (before he can earn his release), and he speculates about his "beginning." It would help me, since to me too I must attribute a beginning, if I could relate it to that of my abode. Did I wait somewhere for this place to be ready to receive me? Or did it wait for me to come and people it? (p. 296) Finding both hypotheses distasteful, he decides: "I shall say therefore that our beginnings co- incide, and that this place was made for me, and I for it, at the same instant" (p. 296). But his speculations lead nowhere, for his desire to find himself is overridden by his fear of ven- turing out of himself; he is afraid to go on. For to go on means going from here, means finding me, losing me, vanishing and beginning again, a stranger first, then little by little the same as always, in another place . . . [which will] turn out to be the same place as always, the same which seems made for me and does not want me, which I seem to want and do not want, take your choice, which spews me out or swallows me up, I'll never know, which is perhaps merely the inside of my distant skull where once I wandered, now am fixed, lost for tininess, or straining against the walls, with my head, my hands, my feet, my back, and ever murmuring my old stories, my old story, as if it were the first time. (pp. 302-03) Where once he was free to wander back and forth between the three zones of his mind, the Unnamable now finds himself trapped in a cham- ber which, like the inmate's cell, confines while it protects, enclosing him with the voice he would like to escape, and which he tries to escape by telling himself stories: concealing himself in his fictional characters, first Mahood, and then Worm. "Perhaps it's by trying to be Worm that I'll finally succeed in being Mahood," he says (p. 339), the suggestion being that through Mahood he might work his way back toward his real self; that he would want to. But that is a fiction also, for what he envies about his characters is their not-being. That is why he envies Malone, "one who is not as I can never not be" (p. 300). And that, of course, is what he would like: not to be. His chief fiction is that he is a creature named Mahood, a legless trunk surmounted by a head and stuck in a jar (another womb-tomb symbol; perhaps a burial urn) into which he is slowly disappearing. "I have dwindled, I dwindle," he says (p. 331), informing us that as he shrinks he slips farther and farther into the jar and will soon disappear entirely-clearly a piece of wishful thinking. Like many another Beckett character, the Un- namable has an obsessive sense of guilt. Since his life is such a punishment, he must be guilty of some offense. But one cannot offend without offending against; therefore, he concludes, there must be some master or masters (or "delegates") he has offended (p. 297), and there must be some task they wish him to perform "before one can be at rest" (p. 311). The task, of course, is to acknowl- edge himself, to "utter" himself (p. 300). "Strange task, which consists in speaking of oneself" (p. 311). For that is the one thing he cannot bring himself to do; hence the fictitious creatures who become his dodge. Referring to memories of Worm, "and the other, what is his name, what was his name, in his jar," he says: 46</page><page sequence="7">Ethel F. Cornwell Mahood, he was called Mahood ... he isn't there any more, he never was there, in his jar.... It is I invented him, him and so many others . . . since I had to speak, without speaking of me, I couldn't speak of me ... I invented my memories, not knowing what I was doing, not one is of me. (pp. 395-96) Deciding that one approach to what he is may be by saying what he is not, the Unnamable admits: I am neither, I needn't say, Murphy, nor Watt, nor Mercier, nor-no, I can't even bring myself to name them, nor any of the others whose very names I forget, who told me I was they, who I must have tried to be, under duress, or through fear, or to avoid acknowledg- ing me. (p. 326) To acknowledge himself is to be, to place him- self among the living, to abandon his attempts at escape. This is what he thinks "they" (the "dele- gates," the world at large, the powers that be) would like him to do. "To make me believe I have an ego all my own, and can speak of it, as they of theirs. Another trap to snap me up among the living" (p. 345). He is at an impasse. For how can he manage "birth into death," as Malone called it, when he has never yet managed birth into life? "The last step! I who could never manage the first" (p. 333). As his mind gradually disintegrates under the strain, the Unnamable imagines that he hears other voices, possibly those of his various selves, his fictitious creations; or of the anonymous "they" who persecute him perpetually, insisting that he cannot die until he has been born, that he cannot escape himself until he has found himself. Ah if I could only find a voice of my own, in all this babble, it would be the end of their troubles, and of mine. That's why there are all these little silences, to try and make me break them. They think I can't bear silence, that some day, somehow, my horror of silence will force me to break it. (p. 348) It is not the final silence he fears, the silence of death; that he longs for. It is the lonely silence, the inner void in which he confronts himself. Hence his compulsion to talk, his willingness to say anything. He imagines his persecutors bending over him, "straining their ears for the murmur of a man," waiting for him to "voice" himself, to "utter" himself, in sheer desperation. If they ever succeed in getting me to give a voice to Worm, in a moment of euphory, perhaps I'll succeed in making it mine, in a moment of confusion. . . . But they won't. Did they ever get Mahood to speak? It seems to me not. I think Murphy spoke now and then [i.e., came to life], the others too perhaps, I don't re- member, but it was clumsily done, you could see the ventriloquist. (p. 348) Since he cannot, will not establish a voice of his own, the Unnamable decides, "I shall not say I again, ever again, it's too farcical. I shall put in its place, whenever I hear it, the third person, if I think of it. Anything to please them. It will make no difference. Where I am there is no one but me, who am not."'0 The shift from the first to the third person indi- cates the gulf between the narrator's inner and outer world, between his mental and physical self, and the tendency of the former to regard the latter as one of its fictions, and to try on various identities like suits of clothes.1" For the Beckett hero (who rejects his outer world, his outer being) there is no bridge between the self-as-subject and the self-as-object, no unity possible. And because of this he can achieve no unified concept of self, no self-identity. He is left with an inner voice, a nameless I-and cursed with a self-perceiving he would like to escape but cannot, since it is an inevitable function of self-consciousness.12 As the Unnamable becomes more and more desperate, the sentences become longer and longer. The voice just runs on and on, wanting to stop but afraid to stop, wanting to be and not to be, longing for the final silence ("the real silence," p. 408) but unable to bear the current one, filling it with the only sound possible, that of his own voice, the sound he most wants to escape. Ah if only this voice could stop, this meaningless voice which prevents you from being nothing, just barely prevents you from being nothing and nowhere, just enough to keep alight this little yellow flame feebly darting from side to side, panting, as if straining to tear itself from its wick, it should never have been lit, or it should never have been fed, or it should have been put out, put out, it should have been let go out. Regretting, that's what helps you go on, that's what gets you on towards the end of the world, regretting what is, re- gretting what was . . . that's what transports you towards the end of regretting. (pp. 370-71) And at last the voice grows so frantic that para- graph and sentence divisions are virtually aban- doned. Not knowing what he has done to deserve such punishment (life), the Unnamable feels guilty for 47</page><page sequence="8">Samuel Beckett: The Flight from Self having been born, and guilty for not having been born (not having established his identity), crying: what have I done to them, what have I done to God, what have they done to God, what has God done to us, nothing, and we've done nothing to him, you can't do anything to him, he can't do anything to us, we're innocent, he's innocent, it's nobody's fault . . . this state of affairs (p. 386) The body is a prison that both protects and confines. In the midst of his verbal rampage, the Unnamable sees an image: it's a body, it's not I, I knew it wouldn't be I, I'm not outside, I'm inside, I'm in something, I'm shut up, the silence is outside, outside, inside, nothing but this voice and the silence all around, no need of walls, yes, we must have walls, I need walls, good and thick, I need a prison, I was right, for me alone, I'll go there now, I'll put me in it, I'm there already, I'll start look- ing for me now, I'm there somewhere, it won't be I, no matter, I'll say it's I, perhaps it will be I, perhaps that's all they're waiting for . . . to give me quittance, waiting for me to say I'm someone, to say I'm some- where, to put me out, into the silence13 Perhaps that's all they are waiting for, for him to acknowledge himself; to "utter" himself; or perhaps, the thought occurs to him, "perhaps they have said me already, perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story." But it will be the same story, it's always the same story: it will be I, it will be the silence, where I am, I don't know, I'll never know, in the silence you don't know, you must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on. (p. 414) Texts for Nothing is a series of poignant cries which begin where The Unnamable left off. "Sud- denly, no, at last, long last, I couldn't any more, I couldn't go on" (text "1"). I should turn away from it all, away from the body, away from the head, let them work it out between them, let them cease, I can't, it's I would have to cease. (Stories and Texts, p. 75) But what and where is "I"? In text "4" the voice asks, "Where would I go, if I could go, who would I be, if I could be ... ?" (p. 91). For by now the narrator feels divorced not only from his body but also from his head. "I'm not in his head, nowhere in his old body, and yet I'm there, for him I'm there, with him, hence all the confusion." The separation which Murphy experienced between body and mind has now become a separation (within the mind) between the self-as-object and the self-as-subject. Once he retreats to the mind, the Beckett character is alone with his perceiving self, and self-perception is in itself an act of self- division. The result, for Beckett's hero, is a loss of inner as well as outer reality: "Who says this, saying it's me?" It's the same old stranger as ever, for whom alone ac- cusative I exist, in the pit of my inexistence, of his, of ours, there's a simple answer. (p. 91) The truth is there's no unity possible between the inner and the outer, between the self-as-subject and the self-as-object. "The truth is he's looking for me to kill me, to have me dead like him, dead like the living" (p. 91). There are moments when it seems possible to be, to exist as a unified creature; moments "when I seem almost restored to the feasible. Then it goes, all goes, and I'm far again, with a far story again, I wait for me afar for my story to begin, to end, and again this voice cannot be mine" (p. 94). To be himself has become impossible, yet "That's where I'd go, if I could go, that's who I'd be, if I could be" (p. 94). Tormented by his failure either to be or not to be, the guilt-ridden speaker in text "5" feels obliged to pass judgment on himself: "To be judge and party, witness and advocate, and he, attentive, indifferent [the perceiving self] who sits and notes" (p. 95). He finds himself caught "in the toils of that obscure assize where to be is to be guilty. That is why nothing appears, all is silent, one is frightened to be born, no, one wishes one were, so as to begin to die. One, meaning me . . ." (p. 95). And in the last sketch, text "13," we see a gradual weakening of "the weak old voice that tried in vain to make me." And were there one day to be here, where there are no days, which is no place, born of the impossible voice the unmakeable being . . . still all would be silent and empty and dark, as now, as soon now, when all will be ended, all said, it [the voice] says, it murmurs. (p. 140) In How It Is, Beckett's next significant work of fiction, the hero speaks from the inner recesses of the mind which Murphy described as zone three, the formless dark where one has all but escaped consciousness. The typography itself reflects the condition of the speaker's mind and the extent of 48</page><page sequence="9">Ethel F. Cornwell his retreat. There are no punctuation marks to indicate sentence breaks, no commas, no periods, just blocks of print that run on and on, and whose arbitrary separations (the spacing of the blocks) suggest the dying gasps of one panting to be gone. Imagining himself on the surface of a thick "pri- meval mud impenetrable dark," into which he is slowly sinking, the speaker recalls the time before Pim, the time with Pim, then returns to the present: the time after Pim. That he imagines him- self crawling through the primeval mud suggests an imminent and a desired return to his origin; that he imagines himself still attached by a cord to his sack ("I never let it go") suggests that, like the Unnamable, he has failed to create himself, failed to be born."4 The three divisions of the book-before Pim, with Pim, after Pim-represent three stages in the development of the narrator's consciousness. Part 1 represents the earliest stage of the hero's life, before self-consciousness sets in, the story "before Pim how I got here" (p. 7), the period when "I pissed and shat . . . in my crib" (p. 9), the period when a woman watched over him and old men "dandled me on their knees" (p. 12). With the development of self-consciousness, part 2, comes the division between the inner and the outer, the mental and the physical, the self as subject and the self as object: the life "with Pim"- and an attempt at self-union, self-creation, that never succeeds. That Pim symbolizes the speaker's objective, physical self is indicated by the reference to Pim's life as "my life up there" (p. 76). "Up there" refers to the external world and its parallel in zone one, which Murphy described as the zone of light; and "down here," to the dark, inner recesses of the mind, to which the narrator has finally re- treated. The life "with Pim," the life "up there," is his life in the world, a period when he lived some- what like other men and had a wife, "my wife above Pam Prim." my life above Pim's life we're talking of Pim my life up there (p. 76) But the alliance of body and mind is in itself a kind of bondage, and the life with Pim, "our life in common," is a "clinging almost to each other," a mixture of love and loathing. almost clinging that's too strong as always he can't repel me it's like my sack when I had it still this provi- dential flesh [Pim] I'll never let it go call that con- stancy if you wish15 Since it is the mind that quickens the body, the narrator imagines himself writhing with Pim in the mud, attempting to unify himself with the body, to bury himself in the flesh: but for me he would never Pim we're talking of Pim never be but for me anything but a dumb limp lump flat for ever in the mud but I'll quicken him you wait and see and how I can efface myself behind my crea- ture when the fit takes me (p. 52) But the union never comes off. The self-division which established Pim (separating the hero into "he" and "I") widens to such an extent that the speaker becomes less and less certain of Pim's reality, except as one more figment of his imagina- tion, a fictitious Pim (the tormented) to be re- placed by an equally fictitious Bom (the tormen- tor). The voice says: can't go on we're talking of me not Pim Pim is finished he has finished me now part three not Pim my voice not his saying this these words can't go on and Pim that Pim never was and Bom whose coming I await to finish be finished have finished me too that Bom will never be no Pim no Bom and this voice quaqua of us all never was only one voice my voice never any other (pp. 86-87) There is no union possible, only a mutual tor- ment between body and mind ("glued to him yes tormenting him yes eternally yes," p. 98). "That's how it was with Pim" (p. 99). In part 3, "after Pim," the narrator has with- drawn to that inner world which denies his own physical existence (Pim's). He has retreated to the third zone, where he is gradually slipping below the level of consciousness and imagines himself "half in the mud half out." no more head in any case hardly any no more heart just enough to be thankful for it a little thankful to be so little there and sinking a little at last having attained the bottom (p. 104) Reflecting on all the fictitious couples he has invented to objectify his situation (Krim, Kram; Skom, Skum, etc.), the speaker acknowledges "that in reality we are one and all from the un- thinkable first to the no less unthinkable last glued together in a vast umbrication of flesh . . ." and that linked thus bodily together each one of us is at the same time Bom and Pim tormentor and tor- 49</page><page sequence="10">50 mented pedant and dunce wooer and wooed speechless and reafflicted with speech in the dark the mud16 And at last, quoting his inner voice as though it were something separate from the conscious "1," the speaker admits that the business of voices, of sacks, of light and dark was all a fabrication; even the business of a journey. In reality there was never any procession no nor any journey no never any Pim no nor any Bom no never any one no only me no answer only me yes so that was true yes (p. 146) In the end we find the subjective intelligence, divorced from inner and outer reality, crying, "WHAT'S MY NAME?" Picturing himself (whatever physical self he has) belly flat in the mud, his arms spread out "like a cross," he screams, "I MAY DIE screams I SHALL DIE screams good." that's how it was end of quotation after Pim how it is17 That's how it was, how it is with Molloy, Malone, Pim, and all the nameless, faceless I's of Beckett's later fiction. Unable to accept the responsibility or the isolation of human conscious- ness, Beckett's narrator retreats to an inner corner which can be escaped only through insanity or death; the Beckett hero toys with both possibil- ities without adopting either, and remains torn by ambivalence, waiting for the end, telling himself stories, playing games, inventing characters to pass the time until that longed-for release from his unbearable, "unmakeable" self.

It is in a garden (in what amounts to a final regression) that Watt meets Sam, and it is to the garden that Moran threatens to retreat when he rebels against being a man.

Subsequent references will be to the editions above. 8 Malone Dies, p. 234. There is a suggestion that the "room" Malone inhabits is itself an inner chamber of the mind, for Malone describes it as similar to six planes of solid bone, and though there is light outside his window, it never really comes through; "it is never light in this place, never really light," but "a kind of leaden light that makes no shadow" (pp. 220-21). But it is not until Thle U,i,iamable that the chamber is clearly defined. 9 The setting reminds one of Nikolai Evreinov's The Theatre of the Soul, which Beckett may have been familiar with, for it was translated into English in 1915 and has been performed from time to time by experimental groups. It is a one-act dramatization of a conflict inside a man we never see: a confiict between his rational and emotional selves. 10 The U,nnamable, p. 355. Moran makes a similar shift from first to third person, an indication of his degree of alienation, and/or an admission by the narrator that Moran is a fiction. See Molloy, p. 176. 11 Similarly, Watt tries out various names for the self he can no longer call "a man." See Watt, p. 83. There is also a strong suggestion that Beckett's shift to France and the French language was an attempt to escape his own (Irish) identity. 12 "Esse est percipi," said Beckett in the general remarks preceding "Film," which he explained thus: "All extra- neous perception suppressed, animal, human, divine, self- perception maintains in being. "Search of non-being in flight from extraneous percep- tion breaking down in inescapability of self-perception." "It will not be clear until the end of film that pursuing perceiver is not extraneous, but self." See Cascando and Other Slhrl Dramatic Pieces (New York: Grove, 1968), p. 75. 13 The Unnamable, p. 410. Regarding the body as a prison to be escaped, Molloy refers to the stranger he passes as a "fellow-convict" (Molloy, p. 12), a viewpoint typical of the Beckett hero. For it is the body that traps one, prevent- Samuel Beckett.: The Flight from Self</page><page sequence="11">Ethel F. Cornwell ing complete freedom of the mind, and delaying one's ulti- mate release, just as Mercier's and Camier's journey is delayed, time and again, by the worldly desires and de- mands of the flesh. The obvious solution, of course, is to get rid of the body, and that is precisely what the Beckett hero attempts to do. 14 How It Is, trans. Samuel Beckett (New York: Grove, 1964), pp. 11, 10. 15 How It Is, p. 55. The more withdrawn the Beckett hero becomes, the stronger the conflict between self-love and self-hate. Once Murphy gets his living quarters arranged to suit him, he has a good night, "the reason being not so much that he had his chair again as that the self whom he loved had the aspect, even to Ticklepenny's inexpert eye, of a real alienation. Or to put it more nicely: conferred that aspect on the self whom he hated" (Murphy, p. 194). And Moran senselessly clubs to death a man whose face "vaguely resembled" his own (Molloy, p. 151), suggesting the self- loathing which becomes an obsession with the hero of How It Is. 16 How It Is, p. 140. One is reminded of previous Beckett pairs (Vladimir-Estragon, Pozzo-Lucky, Hamm-Clov, Mercier-Camier, etc.) who may also represent conflicting aspects of a single personality. See Raymond Federman's discussion of this point, Journey to Clhaos: Samuel Beck- ett's Early Fiction (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1965), p. 136. 17 How It Is, pp. 146-47. That Beckett considers his mod- ern hero a Christ-like martyr is suggested more than once. Sam finds Watt resembling "the Christ believed by Bosch"; Molloy lies down in the ditch "with outspread arms" like a man on a cross; and Estragon openly identifies himself with Christ: "All my life I've compared myself to him." See Watt, p. 159, Molloy, p. 27, and Waiting for Godot (New York: Grove, 1954), p. 34. 51</page></plain_text>
