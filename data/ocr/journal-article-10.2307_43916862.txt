The kingdom style of nobility architecture has endured for hundreds of years, and a few structures may still date to ca. ad 900-1200. The complex floor plans of these large compounds appear to be based upon traditional kingdom social organization that is fast changing, however. Since most structures are still residences, some renovated, a study utilizing both ethnographic fieldwork and the technique of space syntax analysis proved useful to examine historical room meanings and functions and room access. This paper discusses a particular World Heritage site, Ogiamien's Palace, and other Benin kingdom chieftaincy sites. It describes the symbolic and ritual meanings of residential room use and room plans that on observation show seemingly wide layout variation. The results of the cultural analysis are then compared against the permeability plans and the quantitative formulas of space syntax analysis, to confirm the traditional social nature of spatial use in chieftaincy palaces of the former kingdom and suggest an adherence to an underlying ideological paradigm. This paper takes the additional step of employing the software GraphPad Prism to determine real correlations among calculated values; the results indicate a strong cognitive consistency of design and use for the structures over time in spite of visible layout variability.

The kingdom once extended from the Niger River in the east to Lagos in the west and from the Niger Delta in the south to the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers in the north. It was bordered by other emerging mini-state and state systems: Ife, Owo, Idah, Lagos, and Nri. The Benin kingdom emerged from a number of independent villages to mini-states into a sophisticated kingdom (Shaw 1978), as suggested by an earth embankment that is the most complex regional system of its kind documented (Darling 1984). This village-to-state expansionism (see Feinman and Marcus 1998 and Yoffee 2005 for some current views), referred to in folkloric and mythic contexts (e.g., Omoregie 1997) as the first dynasty of "the Ogiso" ("sky rulers"), is believed to have lasted from ca. the ninth to thirteenth centuries. A historical second dynasty emerged out of this myth and flourished intact from the fourteenth to nineteenth centuries. (Ryder 1969) and still exists in modified form, as stated in government gazettes and reports (Partridge 1973). Trade and diplomatic relations in the fifteenth centuiy with Portugal are documented in European archives and in the Benin kingdom's brass castings, as are subsequent relations with Spain, Holland, France, and England (Ryder 1969). In 1897, a British Punitive Expedition, set on controlling trade in the Niger River and the delta, destroyed the palace, burned part of the city, and exiled the king (Igbafe 1979). The Benin kingdom is today renowned for its system of earth embankments (Connah 1975; Darling 1984), a city organized into craft guilds (Ben- Amos 1975, 1980), its brass and ivory objects now housed in world- class museums (Dark 1973; Blackmun 1984; Nevadomsky 1986a, 1994, 2007a), vibrant court rituals (Nevadomsky 1993, 2007b), and a primogeniture-type kingship â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Afř Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 61 system (Bradbuiy 1973). This continuity of royal succession, in spite of colonialism, independence, and globalization, has made the Benin kingdom the most distinguished and long-lived instance of dynasty in sub-Saharan Africa (Ekeh 2000). The kingdom is also noted for its less studied vernacular nobility architecture such as the palace (Dmochowski 1990; Nevadomsky 1997a, b, c, d). The buildings that survived the destruction of the city, and those rebuilt or refurbished afterwards along preconquest patterns, provide insights from architectural archaeology to a historical dimension of core cultural values and uses of space. Although the king's palace was destroyed (later rebuilt on a much reduced scale), a number of traditional structures survived the devastation and are intact today. This paper examines a particular heritage site, Ogiamien's Palace, and identifies other Benin kingdom nobility sites (Iyamu, Uzama Edigi[n], Oliha, Ajayi, Obaseki, Eson, Ero, Oshodi, and lyase Okoro Otun). The paper employs ethnographic research based on two decades of intermittent field- work to explore the meanings of traditional chieftaincy architecture in the former kingdom (see also Nwafor 1979; Ogunje 1983; and Omokhodion 1988). It uses the parameters of space syntax analysis to confirm the spatial functions of nobility archi- tecture and shows permeability graphs for these structures. While the ethnographic analysis provides the meanings of space use and symbolism (e.g., see comparative examples in Blier 1998; Garlake 2002), space syntax analysis (access analysis, permeability graphs) explores consistency of and access to use. It allows comparison and interpretation with other sites and helps generate ways of seeing and understanding (Fairclough 1992; see also Shapiro 2005). Using both, one can assess the relationship among social structure, cultural meanings, vernacular architec- ture, and settlement patterns, both historical and contemporary. Despite its limitations (see Brown 1990; Moore 1996; and Stockett 2005 for critiques and assessments), space syntax analysis is a method designed by architects to determine space use and acces- sibility in contemporary buildings, residential layouts, and suburban developments (Hillier and Hanson 1984, 1987). Archaeologists, anthropologists, and ethnohistorians have successfully adapted it to historic sites such as the Chaco Canyon area in the Four Corners region of the US southwest (Van Dyke 1999), and the Late to Terminal Classic site at Las Canoas in northwest Honduras (Stockett 2005), social inequality in Neolithic Bulgaria (Chapman 1999), medieval convents (Gilchrist 1994), Inuit snow houses (Dawson 2002), and San dwellings in the Kalahari (Widlok 1999). Applied to archae- ological sites, its advantage is that the surveyor gains insights into space use despite the absence of occupants. Applied to anthropological interests, space syntax analysis adds quantitative credibility to intuitive ethnographic fieldwork in both disused and habitable structures. It is also useful for structures in a region that are visually different in layout but show similar access permeability. The one significant study is Z. R. Dmochowski 's posthumous An Introduction to Nigerian Traditional Architecture (1990), a monumental study of Nigeria's native architecture including architectural drawings and plans of significant structures, among them palaces. For seven years Dmochowski directed a national survey of Nigeria's traditional buildings under the auspices of the Nigerian National Commission for Museums and Monuments that resulted in over 1,600 scaled drawings and countless photographs, now housed at the Gdansk Technical University in Poland, with copies in the Jos Museum, Plateau State, Nigeria. Emphasizing construction technology, the three volumes are chockablock with superb scale drawings, sectionals, and isometrics; one of Ô Springer</page><page sequence="4">62 Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 the nine parts is devoted to the former Benin kingdom. Dmochowski demon- strates the spatial complexity of structures, his mission being the rescue of relic built forms, his descriptive survey providing a historical baseline for these traditions as a way of preserving them. He had an obvious abiding affection for and commitment to Nigeria's indigenous architectural achievements, dem- onstrated by drawings, photographs, and useful data on building technology. Since his goal was not the deep analysis of Nigeria's local cultures, his compendium offers little about the meanings of material culture, or local perceptions of rooms, or the cultural logic of residential spaces. The essay here extends Dmochowski 's analysis of Benin kingdom nobility architecture by adding ethnographic, symbolic meanings, and space syntax methodology to elucidate a deeper understanding of this architecture. One aim is to examine how these built structures, still habitable, manifest cultural meanings and social activities in an environment where cultural constructions and social activities are changing. The essay seeks some understandings of the past that descendent societies give to their material heritage, for sites still available, but where the meanings of stakeholders' heritage are rapidly disappearing (see Amerlinck 2001 and the essays on ethnographic archaeology in Castañeda and Matthews 2008). The ethnographic data and the site informa- tion provide a more complex, layered interplay between use of historical architectural space and the symbolic relational meanings of those spaces. The data are useful for those concerned with cultural heritage sites (Mortensen and Hollo well 2009) and, incidentally, for the conservation of clay and mud architecture in West Africa (see Agnew and Brigdland 2006; Rainer et al. 2008). Benin Kingdom Architecture Despite ministry buildings and a GRA (government residential areas, i.e., large com- pounds, and modern houses), Benin City retains the look of a conglomeration of villages catapulted into the present. Tarred and dirt roads mix up the urban grid, along with traffic congestion and potholed roads. But the city plan of spokes radiating from the palace defines the flow of traffic to and from Ring Road, as the center is now called, that serves as the hub for many activities and is linked to the early kings who made Benin City the capital, establishing a formal town pattern of wards, guilds, and a town vs. palace dichotomy (Onokerhoraye 1976, 1977). The sight of broad streets each up to 40 m wide radiating from the king's palace, and crossroads along which houses were built to a regular frontage early on, surprised the sixteenth-century visiting Dutch who marveled that the city consisted of avenues wider, more organized, and almost as grand as any in the Amsterdam of the period (see Denyer 1978). There are/were nearly 50 wards, each the locus of a guild (e.g., brass casters, blacksmiths, weavers, and drummers) responsible to the palace, and inhabited mainly by the Edo (Bini); the latter designation disambiguates the people of Benin City and environs from the larger Edo language group. Defensive earthen embankments defined the palace area, and also encircled the city, entrance into which was through one of nine gates. A distinctive bifurcation of town and palace mapped Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1:59-85 63 an archaic division between the autochthonous groups and a mythic intrusive dynasty. This opposition spatially defined the conflicting interests between patrimonial and gerontocratic authority. European visitors marveled at the size of the royal court, too, estimated at 350 mx 620 m. Walls seven to nine courses (4-5 m) of mud high surrounded the palace complex. A large rectangular forecourt ("[People] Rushing through Gate," i.e., com- moners bearing tribute and to salute the ruler) formed the main entrance. Inside was a large grassy plain where the army congregated. Beyond two more plains and as many as 15 huge, nine-courses-high walled quadrangles housed altars dedicated to past kings, although these are now consolidated into one large chamber that offers an example of what these walled quads must have looked like before 1897. The earthen walls consist of stretcher courses of unsupported puddled mud 0.5 m high and 0.5-1 m thick, periodically resurfaced with clay slip mixed with palm oil, cow dung, charcoal dust, or kaolin. This dressing also protects and decorates interior floors and alcoves (Nevadomsky 1997c). Chieftaincy residences have five courses (for a total height of nearly 3 m), and the palace of the king seven or more. Commoners' houses had four courses and lacked embellishments. The profiling of building façades offers thermal insulation. The exterior and interior walls in chieftaincy residences had horizontal fluting, a mark of rank. The walls of the Oba's (king's) palace and important chiefs were horizontally fluted, having a narrow fillet between the flutes. After a foundation trench had been dug, about a half meter deep, the named layers were laid (the foundation and first layer=eyoto; second layer=eva; third layer=eha; and the fourth=ene, named after Edo [Bini] numerals). Chiefs could have an additional course or courses (six=ehan), and the Oba has as many as he wished or needed. The main entrance, for example, has a gate nine layers high, getting progressively thinner as courses were added. Fluting was done using a snail shell (ughughon). These are large river snails, edible, known colloquially as "Congo meat" and about the size of coconuts. Now, curved metal knives are used to cut out the flutes and then smoothed using a snail shell. Although mostly decorative and linked to rank, fluting served as heat insulation, the ribbed surface radiating heat at night that it had absorbed in the day. Washed periodically with a mixture of laterite mud, water, and cooking oil, the effect could be appealing. Nowadays, permanency is achieved by covering these walls with a light coating of cement painted to resemble laterite. As a royal material for the king, brass foil covered doors, lintels, and beams (Thomas 1910). On pillars and walls in the Oba's palace were hung hundreds of brass plaques depicting historical events (Roth 1903). Ivory, another royal pre- rogative, decorated ancestral altars. Rebuilt on the remains of the old foundation, the main complex of rooms, chambers, and apartments has been reconstructed but on a remembered scale that only approximates the original and occupies an area of about 65 mx 90 m. The traditional horizontal fluting has been retained though most of the wall that now surrounds the complex has been surfaced with cement or made of concrete blocks, as are much of the greatly reduced co-wives' quarters. Terracotta plaques, suggestive of the former brass plaques, are embed- ded in external walls. Roofs are now of corrugated iron, rather than of wood shingles (in the case of the palace) or palm fronds (everyone else), and additions Ö Springer</page><page sequence="6">64 Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 to contemporary taste include an air-conditioned private study, billiards room, tennis court, and enclosed forecourt. The original embellishments of a brass python (perhaps puff adder) and bird of prophecy (possibly egret) are absent. One of the original quadrangles, about 40 mx 60 m, still exists. Except for a large grassy field in front of the palace, and a large medicinal garden and pond at the back, much of the area of the former palace is now Ring Road, the center of town with banks, shops, ministries, and a museum as originally laid out by the British administration after the conquest. The king's private quarters, council chambers, and ceremonial courtyards constituted a series of linked structures along with the apartments for the three auxiliary palace societies: Iwebo, caretakers of the king's regalia, conducted foreign affairs and trade; Ibiwe protected the harem; and Iweguae managed the domestic staff. There were also areas for servants, stables, and storage (Nevadomsky 1997a). These accessible areas today are used as garages for the king's Mercedes-Benz, rice, yams, gifts of an occasional horse, and more recently, ostriches, a gift from a northern emir. Nobility Structures Elaborate houses of the nobility - the king's palace and the residences/compounds of chiefs - contain linked, closely spaced rectangular courtyards. A system of segmenta- tion into internal and external courtyards was employed. Because the roofing was done in small units, little stress was placed on the walls. The projection of eaves over exterior and interior courtyards protected them from rains that averaged over 2,540 mm a year. The courtyards this compluvium design created allowed for light and air because the walls did not have windows. The eaves forming the compluvium channeled water into an impluvium, a sunken hollow in the room. The water flowed out of the house via a drainage system beneath the floor. The impluvium was surrounded by a sheltered walkway, next to which alcoves of raised clay served for sleeping, sitting, storage, or as a recess for household shrines. Hints of a northerly connection have been claimed for the impluvium style tracing back to late Roman, Byzantine, or the Arab world of North Africa. One need not postulate an external source for what was in all probability an independent evolution of space and form. The impluvium house could easily have arisen in a climate of hot sunshine and heavy seasonal rainfall. A taxonomy of architec- tural forms shows that the technology of square or rectangular buildings extends across the West African forest zone from Liberia to Cameroon. Edo (Bini) examples nevertheless show unique developments of technology, house style, and embellishment that may have evolved early on in the political centralization process. In social terms, the compluvium design is a response to a particular kind of family organization. In practical terms, it served as a water catchment area and allows for a structurally effective roofing system. In the absence of windows, the compluvium offers the provision of light and air (Nevadomsky 1997d; also Agbontaen et al. 1996). Compluvia sometimes include a peristyle of columns, but a feature of all is a series of recesses and linteled alcoves that have multiple functions: beds, â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1:59-85 65 couches, sickbays, storage areas for ritual paraphernalia, and the ubiquitous altars that transform every room into a chapel. Shrines are located within and throughout the compound. The alcoves - raised mud platforms of varying size - give each courtyard the layout of an equal-arm cross. Unlike the Yoruba pattern of verandas grouped round a large open square, those of Edo (Bini) chiefs form a compact room, with the courtyard reduced to a small open area. Roofs abut at the corners forming a compluvium that admits light and air, while the floor has an impluvium with an outlet for rainwater. The living spaces, limited by the impluvium, consist of a walkway, about a meter wide, with linteled apses off this. Such residences vary in size and complexity of layout and design. The sequence of courtyards usually begins with the largest apartment that has an altar to the paternal ancestors and doubles as a reception room. Apart from their ceremonial and ritual functions, other rooms function as sleeping areas for sons, children, and servants, while odd corners and small windowless rooms are pantries and closets. The design culminates in the private apartments of the chief, a courtyard of herbal medicines, and an apartment for the favorite wife, that is, one of the non-menstruating wives who takes her turn at cooking and cohabiting with the chief; menstruation is regarded as a polluting bodily function and potentially dangerous to men. Built parallel, or filling a large rectangular space at its end, is the harem (a block of women's apartments, cooking areas, and special menstruation room clearly marked by an open-air courtyard that segregates it from the main house). Far to the back of the house are sex-segregated latrines. Such physical demarcations of social spaces explain Edo (Bini) gender orientations, household security, notions of privacy, and religious organization. Before the use of cinder blocks, the pitched roof and rectangular form, with 3 to 20 or more rooms, characterized village and urban dwellings. Edo villages resemble small, dispersed settlements containing a compact collection of houses facing on to one or more village streets or cleared sandy spaces. Despite centralization, the Edo (Bini) have not typically lived in large towns, and there is much movement between city and countryside. Traditional build- ings are constructed of laterite mud with hardened dirt floors. The standard type incorporates a corridor, running from front entrances to back, off which are small rooms. Often, the corridor is a narrow compluvium open to the sky, with sleeping apartments aligned on either side. Young boys frequently sleep in these small pass-through rooms. It is a very efficient, if crowded, use of space. Roof construction incorporates heavy hardwood timbers laid on, or embed- ded in, the topmost course. Like lintels and doors, these are sometimes ornamented in elite residences with a carved rope motif, the "rope of the world" (symbol of longevity). On this is a triangular frame with central struts (uhe-eni "elephant's backside," i.e., the resemblance to) or trusses. Thin rafters (basically round poles bound together with vines) support the traditional thatch of palm leaves (now corrugated tin). Thatch was closely laid horizontally or made into long rectangular mats pinned with frond stems to the rafters. Roofs pitch from 45 to 60°, steep enough to drain water, protect the thatch, and allow for adequate ventilation without excessive heat. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="8">66 Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 Earlier Studies The study of Benin material culture is predominantly the study of Benin art, not architecture. So astonishing were the brass and ivory artifacts removed as booty by the Punitive Expedition in terms of their virtuosity and technical excellence, and in these ways so close in their comparison to European traditions of art forms, that academic interest immediately zeroed in on them. While art historical interest centered on the corpus of artworks, archaeology got round to sample pit excavations, mainly by Connah (1975) in the 1950s that merited attention because of the human sacrificial pit, and crucial evidence for thirteenth-century brass-casting technology as well as prob- lems of analyzing evidence in a rain forest environment. Important, too, Connah discussed the extraordinary linear earthen ramparts (Benin's "moats") that surround the city. Based on the later mapping by Darling (1984), these earthworks demarcate hundreds of villages in the countryside and gained admission into The Guinness Book of Records as the most extensive and longest series of embankments in the world.. The earliest commentary on Benin City's architecture dates from about the seven- teenth century. J. B. Labat, writing as the Chevalier de Marchais, tells us: The houses in the time of [Gotard] Artus [of Dantzink, Netherlands] were built adjoining to each other in good order, like as in Europe. Those of their grandees and gentry are higher than the rest, and ascended to by steps. At the entry is a vestibule or porch where they may sit or walk, sheltered from the heat. They are cleaned out early in the morning by their slaves, and spread with mats of straw. The inner chamber is square, with a roof open in the middle for the light to pass [a gallery-fronted compluvium court form]. In these apartments they both sleep and eat, though they dress their victuals in other places separate, having many offices under one roof. The houses of the common people have only one [front] wall, with a wooden door in the middle. They have no windows, but receive the light and air from an opening in the roof [court-form galleries without front galleries]. All their buildings are red earth, tempered with water, and being dried by the sun, [the clay] forms a solid wall. They are about two-foot thick, the better to resist the weather, which often destroys them. (Cited by Astley 1745-1747 [1968]: m: 93) In 1668, O. Dapper also commented on house architecture in Benin City: A collection of buildings [Benin City] which occupy as much space as the town of Haarlem, with numerous apartments and fine galleries every bit as large as those on the Exchange at Amsterdam. . .[These galleries are] supported by wood- en pillars encased with copper, where their victories are depicted. . .while the corner of each gallery roof [is] adorned with a small pyramidal tower. (O. Dapper, Description of Africa, quoted in Denyer 1978: 82). European descriptions of Benin City architecture that began in the sixteenth century and continue periodically to the present demonstrate a remarkable continuity in single- story, court-form or courtyard buildings. By the second half of the nineteenth century, Ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 67 such galleried houses were a common feature of early kingdom capitals including the Yoruba kingdoms, and they exist today. Compare these accounts with late-nineteenth-century photographs of Benin, or architecture today in much of Benin City's traditional center or peripheries, and modern descriptions of Yoruba chieftaincy compounds (Awolabi Ojo 1967). Except for the conquest commentaries (Bacon 1897; Boisragon 1897; Roth 1903), actual studies of architecture are few and far between in the early twentieth century. The earliest dates from the late 1930s (Galway 1938; Miles 1938) on altars and compounds, to the 1950s, independently conducted by Goodwin (1957), 1958) and Foyle (1953a, b) who commented on internal courtyards, a style that Goodwin sees as an outcome to local adaptations. His work focuses on problems of constructing these buildings in a tropical, clayey environment that is culturally defined primarily by religious considerations, architectural constraints delicately balanced between traditional needs and ma- terial resources. Culturally, every room contains one or more shrines, and architecturally, walls are protected at the expense of rooms, creating a series of impluvia. These, while better suited to a dry climate and generating several hypotheses of diffusion from north to south, recognize local cultural factors and resource limitations that provide cheap efficiency in meeting local needs. Foyle (1953a, b: 3) is cautious in his attribution of Benin building style origins to external sources, and he, too, recognizes the formal quality of Benin's nobility architecture and its local antecedents, concluding that "no accurate records have yet been made of a method of building and a system of planning which is without parallel in the whole of Nigeria." Indeed, there is little evidence of significant early European inspiration in indigenous urban and nobility archi- tecture, despite some similarities. Ogiamien's Palace The compound of Chief Ogiamien (with illustrative materials from other chiefly and princely compounds) is used as the architectural example. Its choice is dictated by several factors: (1) it is known to have survived the 1897 fire and stands as a prime example of preconquest architecture; (2) although it has been periodically resurfaced with clay, and roofed with corru- gated tin instead of thatch, it retains its location and design that oral tradition, ceremony, and the National Commission for Nigerian Museums and Monu- ments indicate to be roughly a thousand years old; (3) it was inhabited until 1975 long after the National Commission for Museums and Monuments of- fered to maintain (but not own) it as a heritage structure in 1959; (4) it is ideal typical in Weber's (1903 [1997]: 90) sense because it expresses an underlying architectural coda, although as nobility architecture, it is not the most common type of dwelling in Benin City, past or present; and (5) 11 other traditional structures of varying age are included (several of which are discussed) to show that despite architectural design variations, an underlying architectural coda has persisted over the centuries as indicated by the statistical analysis of nobility architecture. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="10">68 Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 The Symbolic Use of Space in Ogiamien's Compound If the principle of hierarchy is evident in compound size and embellishments (e.g., in addition to a number of wall courses, surface embellishments including pot- sherd pavements and walls studded with cowry shells, the traditional currency), the opposition between public and private space (outside vs. inside) is made explicit in the absence of windows, and gender (harem vs. main house) in the layout of the residence. The main Ogiamien palace, 38 mx 26 m, has a footage of approximately 988 sq. m, and ca. 1920, a population of about 400, most of whom lived as extended family in buildings adjacent to the main house and in harems. Part of the latter have been destroyed or since fallen into disuse. The main entrance at the front of the house is separated from the public domain by a long wall broken by a single entrance, "the outer chamber" (ogua-n 'ore' a vestibule where strangers are met. Like all such doorways, protective devices ward off malicious intent while allowing fortune to enter. The "charm of the entrance" ( bo onurho) consists of turtle carapaces and river snail shells and represents tranquility. But close by is a shrine to Esu, a deity of unpredictability and gatekeeper to the gods. Access at night is barred by a large wooden door; its agnomen, "the artisan dies, but his handwork remains in the world" (&lt; owinna gha wu, obo re ye gha rre agbon), expresses the door's solidity. A forecourt, "the outer impluvium," (ghodo-ore ) divides the external wall from the interior apartments. Various shrines are located here, including foundation markers and a blocked-up doorway broken open for the spirits of the deceased to depart (urho erinmwin="door to the spirit world"). The foundation marker is the ikhinmwin tree or iyanto ("the owner of the land"), the male shrine of the land. The ikhinmwin (Latin: Newbouldia laevis) is believed to be the oldest tree in the world; shrines for the deities include Osanobua, Olokun, Ogun, and Osun, creator god, god of fertility and happi- ness, god of iron, and god of medicine, respectively. Visitors allowed in the house are welcomed in the first apartment, "the chamber of the ancestral shrines," having first passed under a doorway containing "the medicine of the dog's belt" (ukhumwun ukugba awa ), a shrine to Osun, a protector of the head of household. On the shrine are ukhurhe , or ancestral staffs, each representing a deceased household head. There are here and elsewhere many material objects (lamps, bells, stools), their practical functions secondary to their spiritual purposes. This and other rooms serve dual functions of practicality and spirituality. One need not accept Lord Raglan's intriguing thesis that the construction of temples preceded the impulse for domestic dwellings. Here, the residence becomes a temple, a protective enclave that indicates how the Edo (Bini) regard the home as a sanctuary and refuge (as evident in the absence of windows, for instance). There are more than 30 shrines in Ogiamien's residence, and deceased members are buried in passageway floors, their spirits offering protection for the living. The paternal ancestral shrine in this room, in addition to its functions as a memorial marker and a protective enclave of ancestral spirits, is also a traditional notary public, certifying anything that is said or transacted there. It ensures that the immediate paternal ancestors of the house are made aware of everything of importance that has transpired here, and actually participate in it, by being offered palm wine and kola nuts (symbols of hospitality like coffee and cake). Bells on the altar awaken them, and the 1.5-2 m â Springer</page><page sequence="11">Afr Archaeol Rev (20 1 4) 3 1 : 59-85 69 ukhurhe , when tapped on the ground by the household head, serve as confirmation and conclusion. An adjoining room contains an alcove/small room for deceased mothers ("the second chamber" ikun ne ogieva or "the middle chamber" ikun ne adese ), its most striking object a wooden hen, symbol of maternity, and its appearance suggesting female reproduction (Nevadomsky 1986a). Since wives are by pat- rilineal rule considered outsiders, this shrine allows the senior wife recognition and protection, although most wives are worshipers of Olokun, deity of fertility and wealth. There is also a sickbay, "the alcove of medicine" ( ogua ukhunmwun), and "the chamber of the shrine to the hand" (ikun ne aro ikegobo ), second cult of the person, symbol of personal achievement (as distinct from ascribed wealth or titles), and one to Ehi, the first cult of the person, one's personal guardian in the spiritual world - a guardian angel as it were - who reports one's progress through life to god. An entire separate chamber to Olokun shows the importance of fertility and success. A chamber to the "chamber of the head" (ikun ne aro uhunmwun ), the third cult of the person, serves also as a storage area for regalia. The head, seat of character and judgment, denotes organizing one's action and assuming responsibility for them. Adjacent is a small room for slaves since worship of the head in elite households sometimes required human sacrifices. As the name implies, "deep inside the house" (ode uwu-iwa) is the house- hold head's apartment with its two beds, one for repose and the other for cohabitation (in most families, a wife does not sleep with her husband). A passageway from this chamber leads to the apartment of the favorite wife, where each non-menstruating wife cooks for her husband and from which she has access to his apartment at night. A door from this room leads to a large courtyard where food is kept and cooked on ceremonial occasions or where the household head entertains guests. Accessed only from the private apartment of the household head or through a small door leading to the outside and known as "the weak door" (urho eghe ghe) because of its narrow width (it served as an escape door), the "courtyard of medicine" (egun) consists of numerous Osun medicinal herbal pots. A small square opening through the wall allows the household head to peer outside and blow medicines in the direction of intruders. Benin's chiefly palaces are typically divided into two parts: the women's rooms (also referred to as the harem or errie) and the main structure, including those rooms for ritual ceremonies and the everyday rooms of the chief or head. These areas are designated for female only use or for male only use. Females do not go into male areas and vice versa. Male and female children who have not yet reached puberty are allowed anywhere in the compound. On the opposite side among almost the entire length and in the past round the back is the wives' quarters or harem. This consists of a long courtyard off of which are small rooms for sleeping and cooking, demarcated by an ikhinmwin tree, representing Olode, the god of the foundation of the harem, complementing the male Iyanto. At the extreme back of the harem is the "house of menstruation" (owa ehe) since menstrual blood is conceived of as polluting and dangerous and women experiencing menses are barred from the house. This room has a door leading into the harem and out of it, to the backyard.

The Benin chieftaincy palace compounds are typical of Benin kingdom planning. Some of these buildings, such as Chief Ogiamien's palace, were originally constructed as early as ad 1200 while others, like the palace of Chief Uzama Edigi[n], were constructed much later. All are habitable (a section of the harem at Ogiamien's palace was until recently used as the living quarters of Chief Ogiamien) and remain in continued use. Figures 1 , 2, and 3 show the floor plan of the compound, schematic and flow chart indicating gender use. Photos 1 and 2 are of a scale model of Ogiamien's compound based on the floor plan. Photos 3, 4, and 5 show interior and exterior spaces. This palace has one unique feature: a forecourt. The next floor plan (Fig. 4) shows the palace of Chief Obaseki. The differentiation of the main building and the harem is not as immediately obvious as in other palaces. The harem abuts the main residence on the southwest side (see north arrow next to layout). The date of construction is uncertain, but much of it predates the British Punitive Expedition of 1 897. Many of the fluted walls including the exterior have been faced with a layer of concrete plastering. This last floor plan (Fig. 5), Chief Uzama Edigi[n], is yet another example of typical Benin planning. It was erected in very late 1915. The main building and co-wives' quarters are set parallel to one another.

Within the context of spatial analysis, space has certain properties that are intrinsic and definable to the use of that space. Space can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Rather, the overall accessibility of different rooms throughout a structure can vary. Symmetrical spaces are equally accessible from a chosen carrier space. Asymmetrical spaces are accessible only by passing through other spaces. Space can be distributed or non-distributed. Distributed spaces Fig. 3 Flow chart of Ogiamien palace compound.

Low RA values mean a high degree of sym- metry, or a high accessibility overall throughout the rooms or spaces examined. Easy access among the rooms represents a more egalitarian use of space. Fig. 4 Floor plan of Obaseki compound Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1:59-85 75 Fig. 5 Floor plan of Edigi[n] compound Distributedness, measured by ringiness values, quantifies routes of access. Low ringiness values indicate a low degree of integration while a high value indicates spatial integration. Specifically, low ringiness values indicate that space is more controlled, i.e., certain rooms can only be accessed via one route and that route is controlled by a specific person or persons. High ringiness values indicate a space with many routes, where no single space determines access to another space. These values can provide archaeologists with a straightforward method for determining possible uses for abandoned or occu- pied buildings and settlements. Distributed and symmetrical spaces indicate non-segregated or communal spaces, and social equality, while non-distributed and asymmetrical spaces show segregation, control over space, and social elite (Hillier and Hanson 1984: 93-105). Archaeologists can employ the techniques of space syntax analysis to study abandoned ruins. Spatial patterns can offer insight into the presence of social equality or segregation within a settlement or structure (Van Dyke 1999: 461). The analysis can be an easy and straightforward method and an excellent starting point to study the social use of long empty buildings (Van Dyke 1999: 461). Space syntax analysis can also be used by ethnographers to examine settlement patterns, particularly those of flexible mobile societies (Widlok 1999: 392). The permeability diagrams for all 11 palaces are shown in Figs. 6, 7. The RA, real relative asymmetry (RRA), and ringiness values are shown in Table 1; the relationship of the ringiness and RRA is shown in the correlation coefficient graph in Fig. 8. Here, we make a tentative attempt at determining the extent to which domestic relations as a scale of social and cultural distance are homologous to, and isomorphic with, house categories as a scale of spatial distance and Ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">76 Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 Fig. 6 Ring chart no. 1 accessibility. Based upon actual use, a few predictions for the spatial analysis of the Benin palaces can be made. These palaces are elite residences; certain spaces are off-limits for different residents. Use of male and female quarters, the kitchen, and the laundry is dictated by gender. Use of various shrines throughout the residence is similarly controlled. It is expected that spatial analysis should illustrate space within the palaces to be non-segregated and non-distributed. Overall ringiness values should be low. The buildings should also show a good degree of asymmetry. The RRA values, a value calculated from the RA to account for variety in building size, should be high. The RRA, like the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="19">Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 31:59-85 77 Fig. 7 Ring chart no. 2 RA, quantifies building symmetry. Due to the palaces' proximity and similar social use, the most important prediction is that the values for the palaces should correlate with each other in some meaningful way. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">78 Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 Method The method used to analyze the Benin palace compounds is based upon the method in Hillier and Hanson's The Social Logic of Space (1984) and Van Dyke's (1999) analysis of Chacoan great houses. 1 . Construct a permeability graph from the carrier space. The carrier space for each building in this study is the outside, as these buildings possess multiple entrances. 2. Assign depth values based upon the shortest distance from the carrier space. 3. Calculate the mean depth: Sum of the depth values total number of rooms 4. Calculate the relative asymmetry: where k represents the total number of rooms 2(MD-1) KA~~k=2~ The value will be between 0 and 1 . Values closer to 1 represent asymmetrical buildings, and values closer to 0 represent symmetrical buildings. 5. Adjust for building size using constants based upon room number: real relative asymmetry. As mentioned above, the RRA quantifies the same idea as the RA, specifically, the overall symmetry of a building, or the overall accessibility among spaces within a structure or settlement, but also accounts for the size of the structure. RRA = - - - constant Values for RRA can be greater than 1. Values close to 0 again represent symmetry, and high values (over 1) represent more asymmetrical buildings. 6. Calculate ringiness: where I represents the number of rings, and k is the total number of rooms in the building. Ringiness =2 k-5. Ringy values range from 0 to 1 . A completely non-distributed system will have a ringy value of 0, and more distributed systems will have values closer to 1 . The calculations offered by space syntax analysis, the RA, the RRA, and the ringiness, offer insight into different attributes of a culture's social values via the use of simple calculations. In an effort to take space syntax analysis one step further, we entered the values obtained from the analysis into a statistical graphing program, GraphPad Prism version 6.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com), and computed a Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient to assess the relationship between the RRA and the ringiness values for the Benin residences. The hope for this endeavor is that statistical analysis might offer an interesting perspective into the process of spatial syntax analysis. Our experimental hypothesis is, given that the elite residences were all constructed for a similar purpose Ô Springer</page><page sequence="21">Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 79 and use within Benin City, what is the probability that the buildings - which presum- ably reflect this similar purpose and use - show ringiness and RRA values that correlate in a meaningful way? Thus, the null hypothesis is that the two values, the RRA and the ringiness, which represent the purpose and use of each residence quantitatively, will show no correlation among residences, or in statistical terms, the numbers simply represent a Gaussian ideal. For the current analysis, the correlation of the RRA values and the ringiness values was examined by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient using the Prism software. These values were selected because the RRA values depend upon the calculated mean depth of the structure, and the ringiness values were calculated based upon patterns of access between rooms. Each value is calculated based upon different variables and thus values do not correlate automatically with one another. Therefore, if a correlation between the values was found, this correlation presumably would be based on the intrinsic building of the structure rather than a circular exercise using the same variables. Correlation does not fit a line through data points, but rather quantifies the degree to which two variables are related. The value of Pearson's coefficient, r, ranges from - 1 to + 1 . Stronger associations will have r values close to - 1 or + 1 , depending on whether the relationship is negative or positive, respectively. Values of-1 or +1 mean that there are no data points that vary from the line of best fit. Values close to 0 indicate more variation around the line of best fit. Each of the 1 1 palaces' values was entered into the graphing program. Real relative asymmetry was chosen arbitrarily for the X axis and ringiness for the Y axis. Under Analyze, "compute r for X vs. every Y data set" and "compute Pearson correlation coefficient" were selected. Prism also calculates the P value. The P value, which ranges from 0 to +1 , answers the question "if the null hypothesis is true, what is the chance that a random sample of data would deviate from the Gaussian ideal as much as these data do?" If the P value is small enough, the null hypothesis can be rejected, as the data would appear to deviate from the Gaussian ideal. Results Values obtained by this analysis are presented in Table 1. The range of calculated "ringiness" values is 0.082-0.190, which is very low. This correlates well with the original hypothesis. As an elite residence, the palaces should exhibit non- distributedness or high control over the access to various spaces throughout the residence. And the calculations clearly show very little segregation of the rooms. The calculated RRA values range from 0.354 to 0.839. These values show a greater tendency towards symmetry than originally expected. RRA values lower than 1 reflect integrated spaces and less segregation within a space, while RRA values over 1 indicate more segregated spaces. The RRA values for the Benin residences, while not widely varying among themselves, indicate symmetrical space, or space that represents a more egalitarian use and the opposite of what was expected. A review of the floor plans and the permeability graphs shows the co-wives' quarters to be quite symmetrical. Such symmetry in a laige part of the compound will affect the overall RRA value of the compound. Such symmetry could have a number of different social causes: non-ranking of the co-wives, non-ranked space or ranking of space that is dependent upon north/south or Ô Springer</page><page sequence="22">80 Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 east/west, or distance proximity to the outside. In Benin, aside from the first co-wife, the co- wives are not considered ranked. Indeed, great pains are exerted to extend equal opportu- nities and benefits to each of the co-wives and, consequently, to her children. The attempt to create equality among the co-wives appears to be extended to the living space. While the nobility architecture of the Benin kingdom varies in layout, design, and size in a complex and urban kingship society, results indicate that they do not vary in permeability and accessibility. This suggests a cognitive consistency of design and use. Since these historical structures are inhabited currently, they have implications for a cultural analysis and for identifying the historical continuity of structures and social organization over time. The RRA values and the ringiness values were first graphed using the Prism software. The points from this graphing exercise are not as tightly grouped as hoped, but there did appear a negative correlation of the values. A Pearson product-moment correlation was run to determine the relationship between the RRA and ringiness values. Prism calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient at r=-0.42 and the P value at P=0.20, where n=ll. The correlation coefficient obtained from this exercise would indicate at least some correlation exists between the RRA values and the ringiness values. Although the r value was not as close to -1 or +1 as we had hoped, the data were obtained from the spatial analysis of physical structures, and an r value of -0.42 is considered sufficiently high to indicate correlation between the RRA and ringiness values. The P value, however, indicates that the null hypothesis is valid and there is no meaningful correlation. Again, as the data used in this study were obtained from the spatial analysis, we considered the high P value carefully. The study sample was quite small (n= 1 1 ).

The low end of the confidence interval was a fairly trivial change; however, the high end of the confidence interval was considered an important change, indicating our data did not provide any solid conclusions. Despite the lack of conclusive results, we postulate that these results show some tantalizing implications for the use of spatial analysis to study correlations among sets of structures. Discussion Benin's palaces reflect the cultural values of those who inhabit them. There is a high degree of separation between the wives' rooms and those of the husband/chief. The chiefs rooms have a much lower permeability than those of his wives. The space allocated for the co-wives is shallow. Nowadays, ordinary concrete block houses are constructed either in a traditional way where rooms open off a central corridor that runs from front to back. Sometimes, these rooms are subdivided into two and serve as parlor and bedroom. The result is the same: the husband has his bedroom and parlor and the wife or wives have a room, or in rare cases two, that serves as parlor or kitchen. The other option is that construction follows a western plan, more common among the urban and sophisticated elite, where the entrance opens into either a foyer or directly to the parlor, with plush chairs and side tables lined against three of the walls, a TV against the fourth wall, and a coffee table in the center. In a polygamous family, each of the wives has her quarters, entering the husband's room only when summoned. Yet even in a monogamous household, the husband and wife have their own private quarters; these may be quite commodious if the husband is wealthy, or if rented, the typical pattern is for the wife to sleep with the children or in a small connecting room. Rooms often serve multifunctional purposes: what the British call a bed-sitter and the Americans call a studio comes close to this idea, though independently derived and with different cultural values attached. Space syntax analysis generally is not used alone. Artifacts or room features offer some of the most important clues when applying spatial analysis to abandoned Ô Springer</page><page sequence="24">82 Air Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 buildings. Ethnographic studies that employ spatial analysis compare known social use with the space syntax analysis results, to acquire further insight into settlement patterns. We believe this exercise demonstrates support for the validity of spatial syntax analysis. To the casual eye, each of these palaces exhibits some diversity in the overall architectural design. Yet, the numbers calculated based on the analysis show similar uses of space in all the palace structures. The simple layout of Uzama Edigi's compound does not appear superficially to relate to the more elaborate layout of Obaseki's compound, and Ogiamien's palace is the only one to have a substantial forecourt leading from the street. Yet, the ringiness values of each compound indicate non-distributedness and low segregation. Each compound also reflects equality among the co-wives in the unexpected RRA values, which revealed a greater tendency towards symmetry than expected of elite residences, and the final analysis indicates that the division and use of space within these palaces is indeed quite similar. The separation of time periods in which each palace was constructed is also intriguing. As noted, Ogiamien's palace dates from about ad 900-1200. It has not been substantially altered except by the destruction of several rooms in the co-wives' quarters, the laterite mud resurfacing of walls and floors, and replacing termite-infested beams and doorposts. Other palace structures have undergone alteration usually by extending the original structure (in the case of Iyamu, the extension is a two-story structure lauded as the first such house in Benin City) or making entry rooms larger to the detriment of forecourts, or both. Relatively late structures (Obaseki's for example) that date from the early twentieth century have cinderblock room additions. Laterite walls (fluted ones, too) are surfaced with durable cement. From an archaeological perspective, what stands out is that the allocations of space within a prescribed formulaic pattern have withstood the test of time despite the vagaries of the elements, superficial material alterations, and the more important dynamics of internal factionalism and external political forces that accompanied the rise and fall of this West African kingdom over a millennium. Leach's (1978) caveat that an archaeological inquiry from contemporary ethnography cannot refract the past needs to be tempered by recognition of the fact that deep-seated cultural values, in centralized political hierarchies and architecturally coded societies, may be impervious or resistant to major modifications, at least until recently. The material creation of space and its geometry - in this case, its space syntax analysis - indicate that the palace habitations analyzed here are prescribed, non- distributed, and asymmetrical. This is exactly what one would expect from a social organization tied to an ideology of hierarchy and authority with its implicit socially operable contrasts of rank, gender, and power and the homologies that follow from it (see Moore 1992, 2005). These values are constructed in idioms, metaphors, rituals, and oral traditions that make a strong appeal to a structured hierarchy of non-distributed asymmetry. The spatial organization of house site and embellishments, shrine placements, and room layouts are ways of thinking about social organization and assigning spatial units to it. Edo (Bini) spatial images express the asymmetrical relationships between categories. Such representations as expressed through spatial organization in turn sustain the ideology of asymmetrical hierarchy and are sustained by it. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="25">Afr Archaeol Rev (2014) 3 1 :59-85 83 Conclusion The data suggest that the spatial organization of the Edo (Bini) elite compound is linked to underlying principles that operate on both a symbolic and material level to situate categories of people within the compound. It establishes an association between a symbolic/structural approach and the methodology of demonstrating that - although spatial organization is rapidly changing to Western uses of space - the cultural paradigms of space may still be the product of a traditional codification process, where the material and mental maps are joined together to constitute a classification of the social world of space. Put another way, an underlying cultural model of social structure is transposed upon settlement patterns and dwellings, in tum establishing physical parameters, boundaries, and accessibility that focus, limit, and may determine social interaction. What makes such data especially compelling is that Ogiamien's palace is listed as a heritage site by the National Commission for Museums and Monuments. Because the dwellings are otherwise personally owned, they can be altered for renovation or bulldozed for rebuilding. This happened to the house built by the maverick artist Chief Idah after his death. His sons replaced a marvel of idiosyncratic architecture with a commercial building (Peek 1985; Nevadomsky 1986b). The Northern Edo palace of the Enogie of Uromi, a historical structure of clay supported by carved wooden anthropomorphic pillars and decorative lintels, has been replaced by a bland multistory office structure that now serves as the palace. Also important is that Ogiamien's palace is no longer inhabited. The present Chief Ogiamien occupied a room of the harem while a student at the University of Benin and now lives elsewhere. As this indicates, and is of great significance, the actual use and cultural meanings of the rooms are gradually obliterated and lost to history and memory.
