Man is the animal that surveys the animal kingdom and his own place in that kingdom, that surveys the vegetable and mineral realms and the place of animals in the general pattern of nature. More than that, man is the animal that sees the entire world as an arbitrary instance of possible kinds of world. He can focus on what is not as definitely as on what is, and on what is remote as definitely as on what is near. He can think of reality or experience in general or as such, rather than simply of this reality or this experience in particular. Because of this power of generalization, it is easy for man to suppose that he has escaped all anthropomorphic limita tions. Yet it seems all too clear, on sober second thought, that this is far from true. The seemingly incurable disagreements among men, including the most knowledgeable ones, in nearly every subject of inquiry suffice to show this. Even mathematicians argue about the concept of transfinite multitudes; and in psychology, sociology, poli tics, metaphysics, religion, ethics, disagreements are pervasive and profound. Like other animals man has the limitation of perceiving only from a spatio-temporal perspective. He is always here and now, while most of the world is there and then, fading away into indis tinctness with respect to details farther and farther off in space-time.</page><page sequence="2">CAN MAN TRANSCEND HIS ANIMALITY? 209 Looking at things in the large, even the whole human race is always here and now, with virtually all the rest of the immense universe more or less inscrutably remote and unknown. Even our collective knowledge is from a tiny center of distinctly grasped items out toward a vastness the details of which are mostly beyond our reach. Thus of the millions (or billions) of planets now believed to exist we know in detail but one, and any others that we may add to the list of known and explored planets must, it seems, always be negli gible as against the totality. In this respect all animals, simply as such, are severely limited. The inaccessibility of reality to man is even more obvious in terms of time than of space. Conceive the past as infinite; it follows that the sample of creation's history which we can know is negligi bly small. Conceive it as finite, and then it seems fairly clear that we can never grasp what is meant by a first stage of creation, a process preceded by no process. All our thinking seems to break down at that point. We would have either an effect of an inconceivable cause, or something which simply transcended the causal idea, and hence our concept for explaining concrete things. I conclude that concrete reality is only fractionally knowable to such as we are; moreover, it seems impossible to say how small the fraction must be. Of the 8600 or more species of birds (quite apart from the million or so species of other animals) on this planet, none is exhaustively known to any one person, or even to ornithology as a science. And there are the practically infinite possibilities for some thing like birds on bodies hidden in space. Nor does any man fully and distinctly know any other man, or even himself. Computers are not going to do away with these limitations. They may change the numerator in the fraction spoken of above; but the denominator is so vast (or even immeasurable) that the fractional character is not essentially altered. Concrete reality is then, most of it, out of our reach. There remains abstract reality, the first principles of things. Can we not know the laws of nature, beyond any fixed limit? Might we not know something like all the basic laws? Ignoring some of the diffi culties which this idea presents, I note one fundamental limitation. If we define law to mean an eternal principle of process, it becomes illogical to assert that by empirical inquiry we can have even rough or approximate knowledge of such principles. Samples from a finite</page><page sequence="3">210 CHARLES HARTSHORNE stretch of process tell nothing as to what is always and forever the case. Extrapolation of empirical generalizations to infinity does not yield even slight probabilities. It is hard enough (and so far seems to have bafHed logicians) to justify induction from short time stretches to very long ones, but this is the most that conceivably could be justified. Experiments show how nature operates now, or at most in our cosmic epoch (Whitehead) ; but the length of the epoch is problematic; and the jump to infinity is sheer assertion, not knowledge. Putting the stipulation "independent of time" into our state ment of a law is only making a claim, not establishing one. The absence of observed change in nature's general patterns of behavior shows that there is no change large enough to be detected by our means of observation in the time intervals our records cover. But slower changes, for all we can know, remain perfectly possible. Or it remains possible, perhaps, that creation is, in certain abstract re spects, at rest for long periods, and then alters abruptly. Perhaps we could come close to the entire set of abstract patterns or laws obtaining for some long stretch of creation's history. There would remain "the unimaginable past" prior to that stretch, and the "unimaginable future" subsequent to it. If cosmologists really think that by empirical inquiry, properly so called, they can pene trate these two mysteries, then I suggest that they are dreaming. Perhaps such dreaming does some good, stimulates truly empirical inquiry in useful ways. But this I hold is the most it can do?unless it does one other thing. It might stimulate some to pursue abstract knowledge of a nonempirical sort, the sort sometimes called meta physical.1 This is not the same kind of knowledge as empirical science, extrapolated to infinity. It is not a probability estimate based upon supposedly fair samples. It does not even assert laws, in the same quantitative sense. It is qualitative and assumes no mea surements. Its results, if it is successful, do not consist of contingent generalities, such as hold of the world in its present cosmic state, but might fail to hold in some other such state. Rather, metaphysi cal truths hold, if at all, of all possible world states. Their denial is i See Chapter II of my Creative Synthesis and Philosophic Method (London and LaSalle, 111.: SCM Press and Open Court Publishing Co., 1970).</page><page sequence="4">CAN MAN TRANSCEND HIS ANIMALITY? 211 not merely false but impossible. And the evidence for this cannot be observation in the same sense as is in question in genuinely em pirical studies. An example of a metaphysical truth, according to the claims of some thinkers, is determinism, taken to mean that antecedent con ditions and the valid causal laws, whatever they are, fully determine what happens. According to other thinkers, the metaphysical truth is indeterminism, the denial that antecedent conditions and laws fully determine what happens. Either way one is not appealing to measurements which have been or could be made. For all parties, if they have their wits about them, know that we shall never have absolute measurements of antecedent conditions, and so can never verify quantitatively, even in a single case, that what happens was, or was not, fully determined by the conditions. It is important that neither determinist nor indeterminist is attempting to find out how much departure from strict regularity, how much randomness, there is in nature. They are not measuring degrees of disorder. Rather, the determinist (in the strict sense) says that there is none to measure and his opponent that there is some. The issue is between zero and some indeterminate finite quantity. In other words, it is between the acceptance or rejection of a category, and this category is not causality but creation, in a sense to be explicated below. Zero is a sort of quantity, but an unobservable one. Only where there is abrupt discontinuity can one observe a pure absence. Thus the zero of elephants in a room is observable because nothing else is much like an elephant, and the smallest elephant is still observably large. But natural laws of the kind required to predict what hap pens involve continuous variables, e.g., velocity, acceleration, angle of incidence. Observations of values under these variables are at best approximate. Diverse conclusions have been drawn from this situation. Some infer that the determinism-indeterminism issue is without cognitive meaning, a mere matter of how we wish to talk. Others hold that determinism is a necessary, or at least helpful, postulate of knowl edge, though not one of its results. Still others, myself among them, think that a certain qualified indeterminism, or qualified determi nism (the qualification, or nonabsoluteness, being the essential</page><page sequence="5">212 CHARLES HARTSHORNE point) is a necessary element of any possible knowledge that under stands itself. On the one hand, mere or absolute indeterminism does not make sense. "No matter what has happened up to now, anything may happen next with equal probability"?these words can be uttered, but no animal can act in accordance with what they seem to say. Just to live is to face the future in terms of the past. A sheer lack of causal connectedness is pragmatically unrealizable. We are going, to some extent, to predict the future and regard it as in some degree already determined. The only live issue is as to the extent of this determination. Is it complete, so that inability to predict is simply ignorance of the past or of valid laws? Or is there an aspect of creative decision in each moment of process, so that what hap pens is only in more or less abstract outline, not in full concreteness, the one and only possible result of the preceding conditions? Is reality for all future time already fully defined by the (partly unknown) conditions and laws, or is process in each instance an addition to the definiteness, not simply of knowledge but of what exists to be known? The theory of process as additional definiteness, as creation of further specificity, the substitution of "determinates" for "deter minables," may be called creationism. Its inventors are Bergson, Peirce, Whitehead, and some others of lesser note. Ortega, Dewey, and others have accepted it. It is not an empirical theory. Rather it is an assertion of what every empirical theory ought to have in common with every other. It is thus an elucidation of the very concept of natural law, or of causality as such. (In a fuller discus sion the statistical aspect of laws would need consideration.) The denial that there is any creativity, in the sense explicated above, is not simply the acceptance of an unobservable quantity, zero. The zero of creativity could only be either more, or less, than a particular quantity of creativity, for it implies that the category of creativity is idle, inapplicable, empty. There are held to be no open possibilities for process to resolve. The very idea of causal possibility is thus implicitly dismissed as vacuous. For determinism, what hap pens is always in truth the sole possibility; but "sole possibility" is the same as "necessity." And so two distinct modal categories are collapsed into one. (I may seem to be forgetting about "other possible worlds." But I am not forgetting. If real alternatives within</page><page sequence="6">CAN MAN TRANSCEND HIS ANIMALITY? 213 nature are rejected, the concept of possibility becomes an illicit appeal to the supernatural.) It is not observation that protests against this, but logical analysis. Spinoza showed on a grand scale the paradoxes which result from identifying possibility and neces sity. For one thing, not only does the possible collapse into the necessary, but both are the same as the actual. It is not hard to show that with this collapse of conceptual distinctions all other basic polarities become problematic or contradictory. Let us return to our theme: man's capacity to transcend animal ity. Man can transcend merely anthropomorphic limitations, I hold, if he can grasp certain extremely abstract truths, such as those pertaining to the very idea of law or causality. By contrast, in knowing particular quantitative laws man remains broadly subject to animal limitation; for at most he knows the laws of his own cosmic epoch, without any possibility of knowing quantitative laws valid for all process, past or future. But in knowing what must hold of any law whatever he may be able to escape his animality, his status as a localized organism, and know what even God could not transcend. I do not believe that any mind whatever could know unqualified determinism, or unqualified indeterminism, to be true; but I do believe that any cognitive animal that thinks freely and carefully enough will come to the conclusion that causal conditions must, in any possible world, influence but not entirely determine what happens in that world. This capacity to know strictly neces sary or universal truth, and thus to transcend the merely animal, is clearly connected with man's ability to use language and related forms of symbolism. The concrete, we have seen, is in large part inaccessible to man, or indeed to any animal. I have so far understated the evidence for this contention. What does it feel like to be a gorilla, a turtle, a bee, an inhabitant of planet X, a paramoecium, a plant cell, an atom? We may know what it is like to observe these creatures with human means of observation. But what is it like to be them? If there is any content to the idea of God, it should, I hold, include the notion of a form of experience or knowledge for which it is possible to know what each and every creature is like in and for itself. But whether or not God can do this, we clearly cannot. Hence behavioral sci entists more and more explictly renounce the claim to know how animals feel or think.</page><page sequence="7">214 CHARLES HARTSHORNE We can to some extent come to anticipate how creatures will behave, but what their sensations and emotions, their experience rather than ours, may be, this is subject to vague conjecture or extremely abstract reconstruction from their behavior and is for us not even possible content of adequate knowledge. The point is not that we cannot decide between vaguely defined alternatives, such as, do songbirds enjoy their songs or do they not? I believe we can resolve this alternative, in favor of the positive assertion.2 But what we cannot do is to have a distinct and verified image of what avian enjoyment is qualitatively, in its differences from human enjoyment. We cannot feel bird feelings, but only human ones. We cannot concretely think bird thoughts, in what ever sense birds have thoughts. We can, I maintain, think thoughts remotely like bird thoughts and, with care, reduce the distance between their thoughts and ours. But we can never know just what the remaining gulf between us and another form of life actually is. We cannot even clearly conceive what nonhuman modes of feeling are possible; our language can only vaguely define such possibilities. So it is not a mere question of deciding between hypotheses. The ultimate limitation lies deeper. But in very abstract matters, language can and does formulate the alternatives. Strict determinism or qualified determinism?one must be right and the other wrong. Inevitably the extent of the qualification more or less escapes us; but the prior question con cerns the qualification as such, the validity of the principle of creativity transcending mere causal necessity, so that what happens is always more definite than the range of what was causally possible. Thus it may have been causally necessary, in a certain case, that an explosion should occur; but still the particular forms taken by the explosion, the behavior of each atom, and of each human being affected by the explosion, may have been incompletely determined by the causal past, so that what actually occurred added something to the antecedent necessity, determined what was previously partly indeterminate. Here we do know what the theoretical alternative is, namely creativity or no creativity, either enrichment of the definite 21 hope to show this in a book to be called Born to Sing: An Interpretation and World Survey of Bird Song.</page><page sequence="8">CAN MAN TRANSCEND HIS ANIMALITY? 215 ness of reality or no enrichment. We know what the question is, and, if I am not mistaken, we know the answer. In this knowledge our animality is left behind. The absurdity of a causal determination so complete as to exclude creativity is as relevant to one cosmic epoch as to another. It has nothing to do with any special quality of sensation or emotion. I hold that any deity creating a world can do this only by eliciting an inferior or humbler form of that power of determining the antecedently inde terminate of which divine creating is the eminent but, therefore, not the only form.3 A world is in principle a society of lesser creators. A literary expression of this, written for children, is found in Charles Kingsley's Water Babies. "I heard, ma'am, that you were always making new beasts out of old." "So people fancy. But I am not going to trouble myself to make things, my little dear. I sit here and make them make themselves." "You are a clever fairy, indeed," thought Tom. And he was quite right. That is a grand trick of good old Mother Carey's, and a grand an swer, which she has had occasion to make several times to imperti nent people. There is one point to be added to this. In making others make themselves, Mother Carey, or any creative power, must first of all make something in herself. A free decision to influence another in a certain direction is a contingent addition to the decider's own reality. God's fiat, "let there be a world with such and such general or outline characteristics, the details to be settled by the creatures themselves," is an item in God's consciousness additional to his eternal essence. Also his knowledge of what the creatures make themselves to be is no constituent or necessary consequence of his essence. If it were, there would be no freedom or contingency anywhere. Freedom is contingent self-making, and causality is sim ply the influence of antecedent acts of self-making upon subsequent acts, by either the same or another individual. Since I have written a book largely to explain this, I shall have little more to say about it in this essay. 3 See Creative Synthesis, Chapter One.</page><page sequence="9">216 CHARLES HARTSHORNE It may be hard for the creatures to know how much creativity they have, to what extent they transcend causal conditions and enrich the determinateness of reality. In estimating this we may flatter ourselves grossly. Or we may masochistically demean our selves by denying that we have any creative options at all. But the principle of creativity, without which the question cannot even be stated, remains transcendent of such secondary issues. The zero of something presupposes the idea of the something. Causality is the boundary within which resolution of indeter minacies takes place. Causal regularities mean not the absence of open possibilities, but their confinement within limits. These limits are like the banks of a river. The banks determine where the water will go (let us, to simplify the analogy, ignore flood conditions), but it is problematic how far the banks determine where each drop or floating body in the water will go. Bringing the banks closer together reduces the options of the floating entities. To render complete the determination by the banks of the destinies of the floating bodies one must reduce the gap between banks to zero. But then there would be no water and nothing to determine. This is an image of determinism. It takes an essentially relative idea, verbally absolutizes it, and thereby deprives it of significance. It changes the subject and is no longer a discussion of causality, the concept, but a word whose meaning has evaporated. I have taken causality as our sample of the sort of very abstract principle in grasping which man can partly elude his animal limits. I could have taken others. I believe that the idea of God sums up all such ideas. Not that God is merely an abstract entity, but that his reality has an abstract aspect which includes all that is abstract to the extreme or metaphysical extent. This abstract aspect of deity we might perhaps succeed in knowing correctly. Insofar, we would share cosmic and eternal truth with God himself. This need not render us conceited. We should still have but a thinking ani mal's grasp of the concrete. We can extend that grasp indefinitely farther than other terrestrial animals. But it still gives us but a vanishingly small fragment of the riches of the cosmos. All we can say is that it may serve our needs?if we are lucky and proceed with care and courage. It leaves us still men, not God. Above all, we remain men, a kind of animal, in our inability altogether to transcend selfishness. A man can grasp abstractly</page><page sequence="10">CAN MAN TRANSCEND HIS ANIMALITY? 217 (though, sadly enough, many of our philosophers and religious teachers have scarcely done even that) the irrationality of making the fortunes of one animal organism in space-time his final and preferential end. He can, though again far from all reputed sages have accomplished this, realize in principle that love of self is rational only as a special case of love of life, experience, and consciousness in general. But we are over and over again, at least in practice, led to treat altruism as at best a special case or derivative of self-interest. We may talk about loving another "as oneself/' but the doing of this is as hard as the saying of it is easy. (If there is no such thing as original sin, there is, and this is an empirical truth, something or other which has at least some of the same results.) Man can know enough to know that he has reason to be humble, not so much because others may be better than he, as because he himself is at every moment tempted to betray the only ideal which can withstand all criticism, the ideal of valuing other individuals on the same basis as one values one's self, or of helping others in proportion as one is in a preferred position to help them, and helping oneself only for that very reason. The ideal is not so very hard to state, though many are the brilliant writers who have failed to state it. The greater difficulty is in the realization in one's own concrete case. In facing the concrete, man is never more than a thinking animal, a highly gifted one to be sure. In his abstract thought, however, he can have aspects of identity with deity, and he can to an indefinite extent conform his concrete awareness and decisions with his abstract superanimal ideals. This is what ethics and reli gion are all about. It is the capacity for generality which is one with the capacity to employ symbols comparable to linguistic signs that makes man unique and preeminent among earth's creatures and enables him, in one aspect, to have partnership with deity.
