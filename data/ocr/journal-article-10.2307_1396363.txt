<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Dan GERSHOM SCHOLEM'S RECONSTRUCTION OF EARLY KABBALAH I The historians of Jewish thought who preceded Gershom Scholem were perplexed by a major problem: how to reconcile the fact of the appearance of the first schools of the kabbalah in the late twelfth century with the fact that the period was also the one in which Jewish philosophy, and es- pecially Jewish rationalistic philosophy, reached its peak? How can a historian accept that the first Jewish scholars who dealt in kabbalistic, mythological symbolism, were contemporaries of Maimonides and wrote the first kabbalistic treatises at the same time that Moses ben Maimon was writing his Guide to the Perplexed? How could two such extremes exist in the same cultural and historical circumstances? The problem was especially acute for historians like Heinrich Graetz, who viewed the kabbalah as inherently un-Jewish and polytheistic, the opposite of everything he regarded as meaningful and important in Jewish culture. For Graetz and those of his mind-set the kabbalah repre- sented everything that Judaism should not be, while, alternatively, Mai- monidean philosophy was seen as the culmination of Jewish rationalistic monotheism in its purest form. It seemed that the appearance of the kabbalah was timed by an invisible hand exactly to the precious moment of the supreme victory of Jewish rationalistic philosophy, when the spirit of Judaism achieved, at last, its utmost refinement. Naturally enough, Graetz and other Jewish nineteenth century rationalists had to explain away the appearance of the kabbalah as the re-emergence of ancient pa- ganism, and as a reactionary response to the great achievements of Jewish philosophy.' In these circumstances, a serious, impartial investigation of the background and emergence of the early circles of kabbalists in Europe was impossible. Another approach to the problem with which Scholem dealt was that of the historian of Jewish philosophy David Neumark,2 who was active in the first decades of our century. Neumark believed that the elements of irrationalism, mysticism and mythology were always present within Juda- 39</page><page sequence="2">ism, and that they emerged in the twelfth and thirteenth century in re- sponse to the atmosphere created by Jewish rationalism. Neumark pre- sented his views in great detail, supported by impressive erudition and insight. But neither he nor Graetz could view the kabbalah as an entity justified by and in itself, possessing its own internal religious and cultural values and meaning. They believed that the appearance of the kabbalah could not be but a response to the greater, more important and religiously perfect phenomenon of philosophical rationalism. It is characteristic of Gershom Scholem's approach to historical prob- lems and to the work of previous scholars that he did not deny their in- sights and claims completely, even though he rejected their attitude towards the kabbalah without reservation. There was in the early kabbalah an element of response and reaction to Jewish philosophy as Graetz argued; there was in the kabbalah an element which can be correctly described as the re-emergence of ancient mythological symbolism which used and transformed philosophical terminology into mystical symbols, as Neumark explained. Scholem did not disregard these arguments; rather he corrected them by incorporating them into a more complete and well-rounded picture based on all pertinent data. The central fact that Scholem found in the various manuscripts that preserved the ancient traditions of the early kabbalists was that in the great centers of Jewish scholarship in Southern France, in Languedoc, a mystical tradition appeared in the twelfth century. A story about the ap- pearance of the prophet Elijah in these schools and his revealing great secrets to the heads of the academies was repeated so often that it could not be declared a legend and nothing else, especially as the kabbalists preserved certain kabbalistic ideas and quotations of these early mystics, quotes that philological analysis has shown could, indeed, have been uttered by the early rabbis of the Provence. The important point that Scholem noted about these traditions was that they did not speak about a messenger from afar (like Aaron of Baghdad in Italy and Germany),3 nor about the revelation of an ancient book (like the Bahir), but about the revelation of the Holy Spirit and the prophet Elijah; that is, no foreign element seems to have been involved, but, rather, the pertinent new ideas were the product of these Provencal academies, of those dis- tinguished local sages who dealt mainly in halachah in the most tradi- tional manner, and who served as leaders to the communities in which they lived. The first clear kabbalistic traditions which have come down to us are from Rabbi Abraham ben David, known by the acronym the Ravad, who was the greatest talmudic authority in Southern France in the second half of the twelfth century.4 The quotations that later kabbalists preserved from the Ravad deal with problems such as the creation of the world and Joseph Dan 40</page><page sequence="3">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah the intentions in prayers, and reveal a use of kabbalistic symbolism in an elementary form, probably not yet systematized. The Ravad is especially known for his critique of Maimonides's code of law, the Mishneh Torah, and his critical remarks are traditionally printed beside the Maimonidean text. Most of these remarks deal with purely halachic matters, but a few of them have ideological differences at their base. The most important among them is the one opposing Maimonides's declaration that belief in a God who has anthropomorphic characteristics is heresy.5 The Ravad wrote in response to Maimonides: "some great people, greater than you, believed in this fashion,"6 though he was careful not to include himself in this group. This statement, it should be noted however, need not have been motivated necessarily by kabbalistic mythology; it could be merely a reflection of the fact that a literal understanding of biblical and talmudic anthropomorphism was wide-spread in this period. The earliest complete work of kabbalah whose author is known to us is the Commentary on Sefer Yezirah by Rabbi Isaac Sagi Nahor ("The Blind"), the son of the Ravad and the accepted leader of the early kab- balists. He was called "the pious", and even mentioning his name was superfluous; everybody know who "the pious" was. His commentary on Sefer Yezirah is a mature, complicated and profound work of kabbalah, which includes most of the basic kabbalistic symbolism concerning the process of creation. According to Rabbi Isaac and all other kabbalists, creation is first and foremost the process of the emanation of the ten divine powers or attributes, the ten sefirot.7 The names and symbols which describe the sefirot in this work of Rabbi Isaac are those which became most current in later kabbalah-unlike those of the Book Bahir, which are, to some extent, unique to that early text. Rabbi Isaac became the leader and the teacher of the next generation of kabbalists in the Provence and, especially, in the small town of Gerona in Catalonia, not far from Barcelona. It seems that the kabbalists in Northern Spain, which was under Christian control, saw themselves as the disciples of Rabbi Isaac, corresponded with him, listened to his advice and followed his directions. Parts of this correspondence were discovered and published by Scholem, who analyzed them in great detail in order to exhaust the precious historical information contained in them, for this is one of the very few sources for the history of the first stage of the develop- ment of the kabbalah.8 In these two centers, the Provence first and then Gerona, the most important ideas of the kabbalah were formulated, its systems of symbols received shape, and its struggle with the religious needs of the Jewish people in the Middle Ages began. From these two centers emerged the message that the kabbalah had for Jewish intellectuals of that time, and for the whole of the Jewish people in later centuries. 41</page><page sequence="4">Joseph Dan II The early kabbalists in the Provence and in Northern Spain developed their mystical traditions in an environment in which Jewish philosophy reigned supreme. The intellectual language of Aristotelian philosophy and its terminology were in frequent usage, and Platonic and neo-Pla- tonic ideas were current among Jewish thinkers. While the authors of the Book Bahir seem to have been almost completely free of such influences, the mystics in the kabbalistic schools of Europe could not avoid, and probably did not wish to avoid, these intellectual influences. Since the first years of the thirteenth century the works of Maimoni- des had aroused controversy within the Jewish world, especially in the Provence.9 Criticism began with the analysis of the attitude of Maimonides towards messianic redemption and, especially, the belief in the resurrec- tion.'0 The controversy spread quickly, especially after the Hebrew trans- lations of the Guide to the Perplexed became known, and the whole scope of Maimonidean philosophy and its implications concerning Jewish beliefs were apparent. In the years 1232-1235 a great controversy, which engulfed Jewish scholars from Spain, France and Germany," raged and became one of the most important historical events in the history of Jewish thought in the Middle Ages. In that controversy some of the most prominent kabbalists of the period took part. One of them, Rabbi Jonah Gerondi, who was a vehe- ment critic of Maimonides, had a part in the beginning of the whole con- troversy. There was some doubt whether he was a kabbalist, but a letter of Rabbi Isaac the Blind to the kabbalists in Gerona seems to demonstrate conclusively that indeed he was, even though his extant works deal ex- clusively with ethical problems in a manner devoid of kabbalistic ter- minology and symbolism.12 The fact that a member of the Gerona circle of kabbalists was one of the instigators of this controversy is suggestive enough; but he was not alone. Rabbi Moses ben Nachman, known as Nachmanides, the great com- mentator on the Torah, was the leader of Northern Spanish Jewry at this time as well as the leader of the Gerona circle of kabbalists.'3 There is no doubt about his central place in the development of the kabbalah. The cryptic kabbalistic notes which he included in his commentary served many kabbalists in later generations; commentaries were written on them, and his authority was so great that several kabbalistic works written by other mystics were attributed to him.'4 Nachmanides had a most active role in the controversy. In its beginning he attempted to pacify the various factions and to minimize the differences. Soon, however, he came under attack by the rationalists and was forced to join the opponents of Maimonides.15 42</page><page sequence="5">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah Scholem emphasized, when discussing this period, that the problem of the role of the kabbalah as such, not only of individual kabbalists who had other roles as well, in the controversy against the rationalistic phi- losophy of Maimonides should be thoroughly investigated. He himself did not complete a specific study on the subject, but left no doubt con- cerning his view that the early kabbalists saw themselves, to some extent, as being under an obligation to stop Jewish rationalism from reaching an extreme position intellectually and achieving a dominant place in Jewish culture.16 While the problem of the historical involvement of the kabbalists in the controversy around Jewish rationalistic philosophy is most important with regard to an understanding of the social and historical attitude of these mystics, there is another problem which has a bearing on the very content of the teachings of these mystics: their attitude towards philosophy as such, and their use of philosophical ideas and terminology in the formulation of their own mystical symbolism. A kabbalist who wrote towards the end of that century, Rabbi Moses of Burgos, said concerning the relationship between Jewish philosophy and kabbalah: "our feet stand where their heads are," meaning that the mystics begin where the philosophers end their deliberations.17 This dictum also claims that there is nothing wrong in philosophy itself; the problem is that the philosophers do not go far enough or that they stop too soon. Kabbalists like Rabbi Moses of Burgos saw themselves as build- ing a theology for which philosophy may serve as a starting point or a basis but from which foundation one must then proceed in non-philo- sophical ways. It seems that while Rabbi Moses's dictum is a relatively late one the attitude it reveals was familiar to the early kabbalists in the Provence and in Spain. Sections in the works of early kabbalists like Rabbi Azriel of Gerona could be read as philosophical treatises, especially as far as ter- minology is concerned. The very distinctive language of the Tibbonite translations of the major works of Jewish philosophy had enormous impact on kabbalistic literature, and their symbolism is often formulated in the same manner. It is not only the external appearance of kabbalistic language and terminology which reveals the influence of Jewish philosophy. The mysti- cal symbols themselves reflect this impact, though it is important to note the differences as well as the similarities. In contrast to the Book Bahir, the works' of the kabbalists of Gerona may seem like a rejection of, or withdrawal from, mythological and gnostic formulations and the con- struction of a "philosophical" mysticism.18 Scholem has shown, in great detail, in his study of the works of Rabbi Isaac the Blind, and particularly in his analysis of the works of the Gerona circle, that the kabbalists 43</page><page sequence="6">Joseph Dan indeed philosophized some of the ideas and symbols that they received in their mystical tradition, but at the same time introduced deep mystical layers into the rationalistic terminology being employed. The most important field in which mysticism and philosophy col- lided in this era, while using similar terminology, was in their under- standing of the sefirot, the ten divine attributes of the Divine in the kab- balistic system, and their hidden, sublime source in the Godhead, called by them en sof "no end." En sofwas regarded by the kabbalists as a divine realm beyond all description, which cannot even be given a symbol based on any scriptural term, for it is not directly mentioned in the bible. The appelation "no end" was regarded as an accidental term, which has no specific significance; it could as well be called "no beginning" or "no color" or any other negative appelation. It is not a symbol nor a descrip- tion of a characteristic; just a convenient phrase to refer to something which is far beyond any reference in human language.19 This en sof is the supreme Godhead, the source of all existence, the beginning of the divine realm, the eternal divine power which was not changed by the creation and will never change. Though it is the source of the divine influence over the world it has no connection with the world and is not influenced by it in any way. A mystic may strive to uplift his soul to the divine hierarchy from one stage to another, but he can never form any mystical contact with the en sof; which cannot be touched by anything out of itself. It is not counted among the divine powers, and no mythological terminology, as, for example, that found in the Bahir, can ever apply to it. This picture of the Godhead is reminiscent, to a very large extent, of the philosophical description of the Aristotelian primal cause, the "un- moved mover," the "thought which only thinks itself' and all the other terms used to describe the source of everything, the supreme divinity, in medieval Aristotelian thought. There can be little doubt that the kab- balists in Europe used the philosophical concept in order to describe and characterize their supreme divine power. To a lesser extent, the same could be said about the ten sefirot which emanate from the en sof according to these mystics. The concept "emana- tion" itself is an idea received by the mystics from philosophy, especially from neo-Platonic philosophy, which had a most profound impact on Jewish mysticism as it had on Christian mysticism of late antiquity and the Middle Ages. The vision of the Godhead as an enormous source of light, spreading around itself diminishing circles of light each outside the other, is a central one to the mystics as it was to the neo-Platonic philosophers. The Jewish mystics in the Provence and Gerona accepted this basic neo-Platonic picture but introduced into it elements which are not found in the philosophical formulations, especially the element of dynamism. 44</page><page sequence="7">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah That is, while the philosophers usually described a permanent, fixed, structure of the descending steps from the hidden Godhead to the earthly realm the mystics saw an element of movement and change in the same process. The various emanated powers in the mystical structure could undergo processes of rising or falling, of diminishing and enlargement, of intense relationships between them of a mythological nature. And this dynamism allowed, even forced, the kabbalists to generate a more pro- found and variegated symbolism than was present in philosophical systems. The structure of the ten sefirot themselves is also reminiscent of a philosophical issue- the divine attributes. Some of the sefirot are called by the kabbalists by names which include ethical connotations, like Justice, Mercy and Compassion, as we also find in the terminology of some phi- losophers who defined the ethical maxims not as characteristics of the Godhead but as attributes of divine action in the lower realms.2 There is a close connection between these two systems and there can hardly be any doubt that the formulation of the system of the ten sefirot and their re- lationship to their source, the en sof, in the process of emanation all carry the signs of the profound impact of Jewish philosophical formulations on the works of the early kabbalists. It should be remembered, however, that while the kabbalistic de- scription of the sefirot was influenced by philosophical terminology the system of the sefirot is not dependent on that terminology. The sefirot as a system of symbols preceded this influence, as witnessed by their descrip- tion in the Book Bahir. This fact reminds us that it would be a mistake, as Scholem often stressed, to imagine that because the early kabbalah assumed a philo- sophical garb, and even though the content of some of its symbols reveal the impact of Jewish philosophy, that, as some nineteenth century Jew- ish scholars contended, the kabbalah is nothing but a reaction to Jewish philosophy. It must be remembered that the kabbalah almost certainly existed in some way before it came into contact with the terminology of the philosophers and that while in thirteenth century Provence and Spain it did assume the characteristics of the culture of that time and place it was not dependent on them for its self-definition. In the coming generations the kabbalah would revert to a mythological symbolism which was very far from the systems adopted and adapted by the Gerona kabbalists. III Some space should be dedicated to the elucidation of the term "sym- bolism", so often used here to describe kabbalistic terminology and so 45</page><page sequence="8">Joseph Dan fundamental to the understanding of Gershom Scholem's explanation of the nature and development of the kabbalah. According to Scholem, a "symbol" in the context of the kabbalah is a term or a description about which nothing further can be said in human language. It is the maximum linguistic approximation to something which is actually and permanently beyond full expression by language. Symbols are terms used not to express what we know but to denote the fact that we know almost nothing about the substance behind the symbol.21 The term "emanation" can serve as a very good example of this necessary feature of kabbalistic symbolism. In Hebrew it is called azilut which is a medieval Hebrew term which evolved, most probably, under the impact of Jewish philosophy; Scholem found its first appearance in Hebrew in a poem by Rabbi Judah ha-Levi.22 Later it was extensively used by the Tibbonites in their translations of the masterpieces of Jewish philosophy into Hebrew, translations which were made for the sake of Jewish scholars in the Provence who were not familiar with the Arabic originals and yet wanted to take part in the new rationalistic movement. Thus the Hebrew term became popular, while its meaning remained constant in philosophical discourse. The mystics used the term in the earliest treatises of European Jewish mysticism-it is found even in the works of Ashkenazi mystics,23 and a biblical connotation was coupled with it to justify its use in Hebrew con- texts;24 it is even probable that some of these mystics were unaware of the fact that it was a medieval term, introduced into Hebrew to translate a non-Hebrew concept. By the time the kabbalists of Gerona used it, it was a commonplace term in both Hebrew mystical and philosophical lit- erature. But the problem is: does the term mean the same thing when used in a philosophical work and a mystical one? Or, in other words, what is the difference between a kabbalistic symbol and a philosophical term? Ac- cording to Scholem, the difference lies in the fact that the philosopher uses the term intending that it mean exactly what it says; he strives for accuracy and unambiguity, trying to formulate his system as clearly as possible, because his philosophical training requires that he logically demonstrate all his conclusions, and this cannot be done unless complete accuracy is achieved. For the philosopher, the terms he uses are vehicles for exact communication between himself and his reader. The mystic, by comparison, cannot, and does not, use language, or even specific terms, e.g. azilut, in the same way, because he deals with contents which are beyond logic, beyond language, beyond human ex- perience; he deals with the mystical, a positive term which really means- the unknown and the unknowable. Accuracy and clarity are out of the question; complete communication is absolutely impossible; if it were possible the contents would cease to be "mystical" and could not convey 46</page><page sequence="9">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah truths which transcend the parameters of human logic, which is the phi- losopher's vehicle. The mystic cannot communicate the truth which he has come to know, yet, self-evidently, mystics do compose treatises, even quite lengthy ones, and do attempt some form of communication with fellow mystics, if not with all mankind. They do this, according to Scholem, via symbolism. For the mystic, "emanation" is not a term describing a process of cre- ation in which the thing created is almost completely similar to its creator. Indeed the term, as employed kabbalistically, does not denote any or- dinarily intelligible concept. Rather the term "emanation" is used in this context as a symbol which declares: the subject I am describing is beyond language, beyond human understanding and expression; yet the closest human word to the completely mysterious truth describing the relation- ship between two other such symbols-this sefirah and that sefirah- is the word "emanation". No bigger mistake can be made than to maintain that the relationship between the two sefirot is "really" one of emanation. If it were so nothing would distinguish the mystic from the philosopher. Yet the mystic's feet are where the philosopher's head is; he begins where the philosopher's logic is exhausted. The symbols cannot convey content, that is, ideas, pictures or feelings in a complete form. They can only give the vaguest hint of that truth which transcends them.25 But these truths - the mystical ones hinted at by symbols-are so great, so profound, they represent such high religious attainment, that even in this vague and remote form they are much more worthwhile, religiously and spiritually, according to the mystic, than the accurate, clear, but mundane and earth- bound truths of the philosopher. When the mystic, Scholem argued, therefore, uses the term azilut he does not and cannot obey the philo- sophical chain of reasoning, of logical examination and proof. He just gives a hint, which cannot be scrutinized nor criticized. He knows that this term is the closest possible approximation found in human language to a divine truth which, in any other way, is completely beyond hu- man reach. This is the source of the great freedom that mysticism allows its be- lievers, and which so fascinated Scholem. They can never be taken to account, their ideas analyzed and accepted or rejected. The mystic can always claim, with pure heart and clear conscience, when criticized, that he "never meant it this way" because he really never meant the symbol to be taken literally, i.e., as if it really represented divine truth. That truth is completely beyond communication, and no one can expect the mystic to write it and convey it to the logical human mind. Therefore he can say whatever he feels, being certain that terms like "heresy" do not apply to him, for he had experienced divine truth and tried to convey it by using human words as symbols. This is also the source of the deep gulf that separates mystics from 47</page><page sequence="10">Joseph Dan non-mystics in a religious community. The mystic believes that as God cannot express anything which is untrue, and the truth cannot be ex- pressed in human language, the words of divine revelation incorporated in the holy writ, be it the Bible, the Gospels or the Koran, cannot be understood literally because then they will be conveying only partial truths or even completely false messages. Their divine source proves that they are set in symbolic language, and in order to be understood they have to be read as such. The mystics could not reconcile themselves to the non-mystic's reliance on the literal meaning, while the non-mystics could hardly understand how the mystics discover such unimaginable interpretations of seemingly simple biblical verses. A case in point is the kabbalistic interpretation of the first chapter of the book of Genesis, the story of the creation. As this chapter presents the beginning of everything, the early kabbalists could not read it as the story of the creation of heaven, earth, fauna and flora. The first event in cosmic history is the emanation of the ten sefirot from the hidden God- head, the en sof These verses should be read, therefore, as the description of this process of emanation, despite the fact that the source of the ema- nated divine attributes cannot be mentioned even in the symbolic language of the Bible. Rabbi Isaac the Blind and his followers,26 therefore, understood the first verse of the Bible as revealing how the sefirot emerged from the en sof: "in the beginning God created heaven and earth" was read as saying: "with the divine wisdom (reshit, beginning, is a reference to this power, i.e., the second sefirah), the Godhead, (unmentioned in the verse or anywhere in biblical symbolism), created the Divine Intelligence (binah, the third sefirah, also called elohim, God), and the divine magnifi- cence (tiferet, the sixth sefirah, which is the central power in the structure of the divine world, and often represents the other five around it, also called "heaven"), and the divine kingdom (malchut, the shekhinah, the tenth sefirah, also called "earth"). Thus this first verse tells of the emana- tion of the ten sefirot in a very brief form, not mentioning the hidden emanator, the en sof. Of course, this way of reading is completely foreign and unacceptable to anyone who cannot adapt his mind and feelings to the symbolical reading of Scripture. On the other hand, for the mystic, as Scholem reminds us, reading the story of the creation as if a divine power toiled and brought forth the physical world is unacceptable, ter- ribly trivial and mundane if not completely sacrilegious. For the mystics, the Holy Scriptures are a divine dictionary of symbols. It is not the mystic who has to search through the whole human language to find the appropriate symbol which will express, in the maximal way possible, the hidden divine truths; God himself did it when he revealed His secrets in human language to Moses on Mount Sinai, to the prophets and to the writers who wrote under the influence of the Holy Spirit. It is not the Scriptures alone that serve the mystic as a treasury of 48</page><page sequence="11">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah symbols. Creation as a whole, which was made by God, reflects inner divine truths in a symbolic way. Morning and evening, light and dark- ness, are nothing but earthly symbols of hidden divine processes, which can be understood by the mystic who is aware of their meaning. The same is true about Man: his creation in "God's image" really means that his body and soul reflect in their structure hidden divine truths in a symbolic manner. The study of human psychology, therefore, like the study of physics or cosmology, is, in actuality, the study of the divine symbolism which was used by the Creator when he transformed divine structures into the physical world. Human history, the relationships between nations, natural upheavals and catastrophes, in so far as they are directed by God, are also such symbolic reflections of mystical truth, if read correctly by a mystic. The mystic denies the veracity of all that is learned by the senses or the mind, all that is literal and apparent, if taken as completely true; he believes that all apparent phenomena are opaque reflections of an unknown and unknowable divine truth, of which the earthly manifestations are remote symbols, understood only by those who reject the literal and the logical. "Where their heads are, there our feet stand," where the literal and physical understanding of nature, man, history and the scriptures ends, there begins the deeper understanding of the underlying secrets of the divine world. Scholem always emphasized the vast difference between symbolism and allegory. Allegory, according to him, means two corresponding layers of truth, one revealed and the other hidden, but the revealed one can be accurately translated to the hidden one and thus reveal the hidden layer. For instance, the presentation above of the kabbalistic interpretation of the first verse of Genesis was, in form, allegorical: the verse says "earth" but means to say "the shekhinah," and all one has to do is to translate from one set of words to another. But for the mystic "shekhinah" is not a word, corresponding to "earth"; it is a symbol which can be understood by the human mind only as a hint pointing towards something which is far beyond itself. When one "translates" "earth" to "shekhinah" one does not explain or clarify anything; rather, one obscures and mystifies the verse, for nobody knows, or can ever know in a logical fashion, what the shekhinah really is. We can know many, even hundreds, of different sym- bols which refer to various aspects of this divine power and its charac- teristics and functions but we can never know the shekhinah as it really is. Symbolism is the maximum we can know, and this maximum is ex- tremely minimal. In an allegory, the connection between one layer of meaning and the other one is artificial. On an allegorical level, the choice of "earth" to represent "shekhinah" is completely arbitrary, because there is no under- lying, inherent connection between the two. In mystical symbolism, by contrast, the symbol, even though it expresses only a very small part of 49</page><page sequence="12">Joseph Dan the content and meaning of the symbolized power, manifests a real and essential connection to that power. "Earth" and "shekhinah" equally repre- sent the hidden divine essence in a remote way, and they are part of that mysterious and hidden entity which is beyond man's reach. This has been frequently described as the relationship between the revealed and hidden parts of an iceberg. The revealed part, the symbol, is really a part of the iceberg, but anyone mistaking it for the iceberg itself will be making a very great mistake, indeed, a titanic mistake. The study of kabbalistic works is therefore the study of the symbols that the Jewish mystics used when they described the divine world in their intricate system of symbolism. Scholem did not see himself as study- ing the divine world of the kabbalists as it "really" is, and therefore the question "are there really ten sefirot" was for him a completely irrelevant one.27 He dealt with the symbols, their emergence and development, and especially with their historical impact, and not with the underlying con- tent, which, according the kabbalists, cannot be approached by sensual and logical means. This understanding of the nature of the kabbalistic symbol is also necessary if one is to arrive at a correct understanding of the kabbalist's standing within the framework of Jewish orthodoxy.28 Throughout his- tory the kabbalists were, with one notorious exception (the Sabbatian movement), a preserving, traditional and orthodox power, helping Juda- ism survive in the hostile environments of the European Middle Ages and the Eastern European context of modern times. One may rightfully ask how a movement which describes ten divine powers, and hence is ap- parently polytheistic, can be a strong force supporting orthodoxy within a monotheistic religious group. The answer lies, of course, in the nature of symbolism. In the literal and physical world "ten" means much more than one, and therefore the clash between monotheism and polytheism. But when symbolism is introduced why assume that in the mystical hidden realm "ten" is "more" than "one"? Such a claim can be put forward only by someone who pretends to know what ten truly represents and what one truly represents; but as the mystic cannot, and knows he cannot, express the mystical content of these symbols it is possible to claim that within the divine realm "ten" is the true essence of "one" and that there is no contradiction between them, one being a specific aspect of the other. This is probably the reason why, throughout history, there has been so little theological criticism of the kabbalah among Jewish intellectuals (except for a few bursts in thirteenth century Spain and in Italy during and after the Renaissance). It is doubtful whether many of the Jewish non-mystics throughout the ages understood the intricacies of kabbalistic symbolism concerning the sefirot and the Godhead, or accepted the kabbalistic way of interpreting scriptural verses. But another aspect of this system of symbols, as Scholem 50</page><page sequence="13">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah regularly observed, had a profound impact on Jewish religious thought and practice, and demonstrated the orthodox and constructive character of the kabbalah, making it almost immune to all criticism. This is the kabbalistic attitude towards the practical commandments of Judaism, the deeds required of every Jew in his ethical behaviour and social and re- ligious life-the mitsvot. In the Middle Ages Judaism found itself in a most difficult situation concerning the rationale for the multitude of mitsvot that the Jew was expected to perform as commanded by the Torah and its rabbinic inter- preters. The culture of the Middle Ages, under the impact of the Christian spiritualization of religious life and the neo-Platonic disjunction of matter and spirit, tended to identify religious life and progress in one's rela- tionship to God as a process of increasing spiritualization. The level of religious attainment was judged by the purity of spiritual life and by one's distance from matter and everything connected with the physical world. Judaism had to confront this cultural environment, which was hostile to it from the start, with a religious practice which seemed to be concentrated almost exclusively on the practical, physical performance of material deeds. Jewish religious law seemed to decide one's level of religious at- tainment solely by one's physical and bodily behaviour, and not by re- course to any inner spiritual element. All medieval Jewish theologies and ethical systems, therefore, had to give an answer to the question: how can Judaism claim to be a superior religion when its demands are almost exclusively physical? And each Jewish intellectual camp devised its own answer towards the spiritualiza- tion of the religious life in Judaism.29 Some did it by devising a whole system of spiritual commandments which they claimed were superior to the physical ones, though still founded on the demands of the torah. For example, Rabbi Bahya Ibn Paqudah in eleventh century Spain introduced mystical elements into his required "Duties of the Hearts," elements which Scholem emphasized and described as representing one of the earliest manifestations of Jewish mysticism in medieval Europe.30 Most phi- losophers chose a way which gave spiritual reasons for physical deeds, like demonstrating the belief in the unity of God and devotion to him, some even ascribing allegorical meanings to the mitsvot. Jewish phi- losophy as a whole tried to interpret the reasons for the commandments (ta'amey ha-mitsvot), in a rational manner emphasizing their social and religious functions.31 The Ashkenazi Hasidim chose a more radical way, but also a more conservative one. According to them it is not the physical deed that has a religious meaning but the spiritual effort involved in carrying it out.32 They did not see the mitsvot as supplementing human life and happiness but rather as a trial put before Man by God to test his devotion to Him and his rejection of all worldly temptations, even including one's attach- 51</page><page sequence="14">Joseph Dan ment to one's body. "Kiddush ha-shem," the supreme sacrifice of life for the sake of God's glory, was the example for all the mitsvot. Each com- mandment has an element of sacrifice of a portion of Man's human desires for the sake of heaven. God does not judge a man according to the number of commandments he has performed, but according to the hard- ships, suffering and sacrifices that a person undergoes in order to perform them. A commandment performed easily is worth much less than the same one performed while overcoming many difficulties. On the one hand, this system insists on the spiritual significance of religious prac- tice, giving no intrinsic value to the physical performance. But on the other hand, this system does not allow the creation of a "spiritual religion" which will neglect the actual commandments and concentrate instead on spiritual values, as most of the philosophical systems seemed to allow. If the actual performance of the commandment is the proof of one's success- ful negation of the physical world, and every failure in carrying it out proves that one has yielded to worldly temptations, then the only cri- terion of religious achievement remains the performance of the mitsvot and no spiritual substitute is possible; physical success is the only way to spiritual achievement. The kabbalists, as Scholem emphasized, chose a completely different way, which, historically speaking, proved to be the most successful. It was the one adopted by all orthodox Jewish movements in early modern times and which survives to this very day among the most orthodox Jewish groups. The kabbalists interpreted the commandments as symbols. Every human deed has a counterpart in the divine world. Each good deed con- tributes something to the process through which it is connected to, and efficacious in, the divine world, and each bad deed is detrimental to that divine process. As it is impossible to know the actual mystical content of these processes, all man knows are the symbols. The content of the mitsvot, therefore, is purely spiritual; they involve divine powers and their dy- namic life within the divine realm. The physical commandments, how- ever, represent the earthly symbolic counterpart to these divine and completely hidden purposes.33 The building of a sukkah, a tabernacle, certainly does not seem to be a spiritual deed, though its traditional meaning is the remembrance of the redemption from Egypt; one may claim that he has better ways to remember that event than spending a week in Autumn in a loose hut in the yard. According to the kabbalists, however, the sukkah really symbolized something connected with the union between the sixth sefirah, tiferet, which is the male element in the divine realm, and the shekhinah, the female element. The form of the tabernacle is modeled, according to them, after the bridal canopy under which these divine powers are united. Mystical symbolism hints at the spiritual divine processes with which the commandments are connected; 52</page><page sequence="15">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah a full understanding of these processes being impossible, because the mystical truth beyond the symbols is unknown and unknowable. There- fore, in order to participate in the mystical union in the divine realm a mystic can only adhere to the symbol, perform it as strictly as possible with maximum attention to the minutest detail, for not knowing the sig- nificance of such details one can never be sure whether this one is a crucial one or a secondary element in that mystical process. Thus, while the physical deeds themselves may seem to lose their intrinsic importance, the religious message is clear and unambiguous: only by the strict ad- herance to every physical element in the practical commandments of Jewish tradition can a man achieve contact with the spiritual, divine, content hiding behind them; a content which, being mystical, can never be understood or approached in an intellectual manner, but only with the detailed observance of the commandments as such. Symbolism in this way created a unity between the spiritual and the physical, and strengthened the orthodox element in medieval Judaism. This basic orthodoxy contributed to the fact that the kabbalah was almost never criticized in the Middle Ages whereas Jewish philosophy came under heavy attack. While the kabbalah was undoubtedly more radical in its ways of thought and concepts, as far as deeds were concerned it was above reproach, formulating a new system of ta'amey ha-mitsvot ("reasons for the commandments") which gave new spiritual reasons for their observance. Judaism tended to leave alone any thinker who did not interfere with the practical behaviour of Jews; it attacked vehemently anyone attempting to change one of its practices. It may be said that while in Christian history heretics occupy a much more central place than sinners, in Judaism it is very difficult to become a heretic, while it is very easy to become a sinner. The kabbalists were neither: the armor of their symbolism protected them from heresy by claiming that their ex- pressions should never be taken literally, and from sin by seeing the commandments as a set of symbols given to them by God in order to enable the mystics to come close to Him and to participate and influence the inner dynamism of the divine realm. V The early kabbalists in Spain and the Provence, in Scholem's reconstruc- tion, are seen to have concentrated their efforts on the development of kabbalistic symbolism concerning the secret of the creation, the divine processes which governed it, and the further stages of the development of the world. They did not dream as yet that their symbols would, one day, transform Judaism and that mass movements would emerge preach- ing kabbalistic ideas to the nation as a whole. It seems that from the be- 53</page><page sequence="16">Joseph Dan ginning their orientation was towards small, closed circles and groups dealing with esoteric ideas for their own sake, practising communion with God alone, demanding nothing from the community as a whole. Scholem stressed the esoteric character of the early kabbalistic circles, a character rooted in their theology. Their insistent concentration on the "secret of the creation" (sod ma'aseh bereshit) was the result of the way they understood the process of mystical communion with God. Rabbi Isaac the Blind, in his commentary on the Sefer Yezirah, and the other early kabbalists who analyzed in great detail the process by which the first divine attributes emanated from the Godhead and assumed their personalistic character, were not only interested in an academic inquiry concerning the roots of all existence and the emergence of the world as we know it. They saw the process of emanation as the one which leads down from the complete unity, a spiritual unity, which existed when all began, when the different divine powers were still united within the Godhead, until it reached the enormous plurality of the physical world, where nothing is identical with the other and nothing can be united with anything else. The soul of the mystic wishes to deny this plurality, to turn away from it, and to be part of the true divine unity. This unity is a situation of the past and, therefore, the past has to be sought, understood and a way to return to it found. For these kabbalists the sod maaseh bereshit was a divine ladder, leading down from the early unity within the Godhead to the plurality of the created world.34 If this ladder can be understood in depth, its whole symbolism un- veiled before the eyes of the mystics, the mysteries involved in it embedded in his innermost soul, then there is a chance that the mystic might repeat the process, but this time from the end to the beginning. He could, under these circumstances, attempt to use the ladder of descent in which the divine powers emanated stage by stage as a ladder of ascension to uplift his soul towards the sublime unity which always lies above, and before him (in the chronological sense, because the earlier the time the closer one is to the complete original unity). "The Secret of Creation" was thus the means by which the mystic discussed the symbolism which repre- sented not only the origin of the world, but also the target towards which the mystic tries to advance-an advance which, historically speaking, is a retreat towards the past.35 This mysticism of a retreat towards a unity with the Godhead which was in the beginning of all, and diminished during history, is not a na- tional or community endeavor. It means that the mystic turns his back to contemporary history and has no interest in current affairs and in the ad- vancement towards a better future. This is an individual path, to be taken by the mystic alone, as an individual, or probably together with a small group of his friends; there is nothing here for the masses, no message of salvation or redemption. This explains the surprising neglect 54</page><page sequence="17">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah of the messianic element in early kabbalistic works, from the Bahir through the kabbalists in the Provence and Gerona. They repeated the traditional formulae of messianic belief, but did not add anything to it and did not connect it with kabbalistic symbolism. The symbolism of redemption was, for them, the story of the process of emanation in the beginning of all, the sod ma'aseh bereshit. This, essentially, is the picture Scholem drew of the esoteric nature of the early kabbalistic circles in medieval Europe. As kabbalists, they were not interested in the world around them. As individuals, they could be leaders of communities and of academies and do their best to protect and enhance the interests of their fellow Jews. Thus, the Ravad in his generation at the end of the twelfth century and Nachmanides in the next generation, in the first half and middle of the thirteenth century, were central figures in the contemporary Jewish leadership. Yet nothing of this kind, no element of leadership or historical purpose, is apparent in their kabbalistic works or in the writings of their friends in the circles that were centered around them. As mystics they closed themselves in small groups, produced their obscure symbolism which could not be understood by anyone not initiated in one of these circles, and dealt with their individual kind of redemption and mystical unity which was com- pletely separated from contemporary historical events.36 Because of this their first works do not reveal much interest in the more popular and practical side of religion. The theological problems centering around the commandments are not central in the Bahir; several of them are interpreted in it in a symbolical, mystical manner, but no clear message can be discerned from these comments.37 Rabbi Isaac the Blind and the kabbalistic works of the Gerona circle followed the same line; not much is found in them concerning every-day life, ethical beha- viour and reasons for the ritualistic commandments, even though the basic attitude towards them as symbols of divine processes is already clearly present there. Only in the next generation, in the second half of the thirteenth century, do kabbalists begin to write specific works on this subject. Scholem discovered evidence proving that the concentration of the early kabbalists in closed esoteric circles was not achieved without op- position and internal strife. In a manuscript he discovered and published he reveals a letter by Rabbi Isaac the Blind to the kabbalists in Gerona, a letter written in the manner of a Rabbi chastizing his disciples.38 Rabbi Isaac complained in this letter that he had received information that in Gerona people were talking about the kabbalah and its secrets "in the streets and in the market-places," and that the symbols of the kabbalah were becoming public property. Rabbi Isaac admonished the recipients of the letter saying that such wide knowledge of the secrets of the kabbalah must lead to misunderstanding and controversy around the kabbalah, 55</page><page sequence="18">Joseph Dan for these secrets cannot be correctly understood by the wide public. He opposed even the writing of kabbalistic books and warned his disciples that if they believed that they could write books and keep them secret they were mistaken, for "there is no cupboard which can hide a book already written." It seems that Rabbi Isaac directed his criticism especially against Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel, the founders of the kabbalistic center in Gerona, each of whom wrote several kabbalistic treatises, some of them of book length.39 Rabbi Isaac's censure seems to have succeeded for the other kabbalists of Gerona that we know of (who were younger than Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel), did not write any kabbalistic treatises in the manner of their predecessors, let alone books, and their mystical teachings were incorporated in other works. In short, the members of the kabbalistic center in Gerona accepted, so the facts seem to denote, the demand of Rabbi Isaac not to talk openly about the kabbalah and not to write kabbalistic works thus strengthening the esoteric character of the early kabbalistic circles. A demonstration of the esoteric character of the early Jewish mystics in medieval Europe is found in the works of a circle of mystics whom Scholem called "The Iyyun Circle," after the central work of this school, Sefer ha-Iyyun, "the Book of Contemplation". Scholem listed thirty-two treatises which he ascribed to this group,40 all of them brief works of a few pages each. Some of these, including the Sefer ha-Iyyun and the works closest to it in their terminology and symbolism, do not use the usual kabbalistic system of ten sefirot and it seems that it was unknown to them; instead, they use a symbolism of thirteen divine middot, attributes, and in this, as in most other ways, they differ from the other early kabbalists.4' They seem to rely very heavily on neo-Platonic ideas and terminology,42 color symbolism is very prominent in these works, and there is a more central treatment of mathematical and linguistic elements, following the Sefer Yezirah but demonstrating a special tradition concerning its sym- bolical interpretation. All these thirty-two treatises are either anonymous, or attributed to ancient writers, tannaim (teachers of the Mishnah) or geonim (seventh to tenth centuries), some to the ancient Hekhalot mystics with whom they seem to have had close spiritual ties, and some are at- tributed to completely fictional figures. There is nothing in these works which could identify either the exact period of their composition or the exact geographical location of the group. Scholem suggested that they probably lived in Southern France in the beginning of the thirteenth century, and the vocabulary they used seems to strengthen this suggestion. The almost exclusive subject of these works is, in various ways, the "Secret of the Creation," and their mysticism undoubtedly was connected with the symbolism representing that process. To this day they remain esoteric and hidden from history, an anonymous and featureless group 56</page><page sequence="19">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah of enthusiastic Jewish mystics who left their ideas to posterity through the medium of the incorporation of their doctrines in the literature of the later kabbalah. VI Rabbi Isaac the Blind's warning that the publication of kabbalistic secrets could lead to misunderstanding and controversy proved correct, and, characteristically enough, it occurred concerning the one aspect of active, every-day religious life that the early kabbalists concentrated on and dis- cussed in detail: the meaning and character of prayer. From its earliest beginnings, Jewish mysticism was specifically in- terested in the nature of Jewish prayer. Hekhalot mysticism (i.e., the mys- tical teachings of the talmudic era) is concentrated to a very large extent on the kedushah, the third benediction among the eighteen, in which the verse from Isaiah 6:4 C is recited, and an identification is created between the public praying in the synagogue and the angels praising God around his throne of glory.43 The Hekhalot hymns are very close to the kedushah and they denote that the mystical process in the eyes of the ancient Jewish mystics in Israel and Babylonia was connected with the process of prayer. The Book Bahir, in a similar way, discusses in relative detail the kedushah and the benediction of the priests,44 hinting at the profound symbolism concerning the divine world hidden within these prayers. Some of the. earliest traditions that we have from the first kabbalists deal with the secret of the intention in prayers. The Ravad himself di- vided the intention of the "eighteen benedictions" between "the creator" (yotzer bereshit, the term used in the Shiur Komah for God), and the "prime cause" (ilat ha-ilot, the Hebrew term which translated the Aristotelian concept). His meaning in making this division is not completely clear,45 but it seems that he directed the part of this prayer which praises God towards the highest possible place in the Godhead, while the other part, which deals with earthly requests, to a lower divine power, possibly the third sefirah, binah. Rabbi Jacob ha-Nazir, a contemporary of Rabbi Isaac the Blind (or possibly predating R. Isaac), gave a detailed set of instruc- tions concerning the exact sefirot to be aimed at during the reciting of the Shema ("Hear O Israel") and the division of the "eighteen benedictions" between the divine powers. He also insisted that there is a difference in the intentions relative to the time of the prayer: in daytime -towards the sixth power, tiferet, and at night, towards the third, binah. Rabbi Azriel of Gerona was the first kabbalist to dedicate a whole book to the subject, in which he described the symbolism behind almost every word in the prayers and the part of the divine realm to which they relate. In his other works the subject is also prominent: in his commentary 57</page><page sequence="20">Joseph Dan on the talmudic aggadot46 Rabbi Azriel included a very profound com- mentary on the word amen, proving that the various words in Hebrew which derive from that root include in a symbolical manner all aspects of the divine world, therefore all the sefirot are incorporated and united within the amen; this is why the talmud said that "one who says the amen after the benediction is greater than the one who says the benediction itself."47 Many other early kabbalists dealt with the problem of the inten- tion of prayers, including Rabbi Asher ben David, the nephew of Rabbi Isaac the Blind, who was sent by Rabbi Isaac to Gerona to instruct the kabbalists there in the teachings of the school of kabbalists in the Provence. Another Gerona writer on the subject was Rabbi Jacob ben Sheshet, a relatively prolific writer, who dedicated an ethical composition, "Faith and Reason" (ha-Emunah veha-Bitahon) to several subjects dealing with the spiritual observance of the Jewish traditional commandments and norms, including the prayers.48 This text became a popular one and undoubtedly was instrumental in the spreading of kabbalistic ideas among non-mystics. Rabbi Jacob did not write this study as a purely kabbalistic one; most of it is comprised of talmudic and midrashic sayings, homi- letically interpreted by the author in a manner intended to instruct his contemporaries in traditional Jewish ethics. His kabbalistic views are expressed in a subdued manner, but they are still quite obvious to the trained reader (as a consequence this work was later, incorrectly, at- tributed to Nachmanides). All this activity concerning prayer did not go unnoticed outside the circles of the kabbalists. This subject was one which concerned every Jew upon whom prayer was incumbent three times a day. The subject of the correct ways to pray, including spiritual intentions, was a major subject discussed in halachic works. Many such books of law dedicated their first chapters to prayer and introduced the legal discussion with a preface dealing with the intellectual intentions. When it became known that the kabbalists had something to say about this interest was aroused, and with it the beginnings of criticism of the kabbalistic approach to this basic subject. In a collection of documents by Rabbi Meir ben Shimeon of Nar- bonne, which the author called Milhemet Mitzvah, Scholem found and published a letter by the thirteenth century author attacking the kabbalists for their beliefs in general and especially for their teachings concerning prayer.49 He described them as polytheists, who "direct the day's prayer to one God and the night's to another God," while on various days and religious festivals one's prayers are to be directed to different powers. He mentioned the Book Bahir, though the quotation he brings is absent from the versions of the Bahir which have reached us. There is no doubt that he was aware, at least in a general way, of the teachings of the early kabbalists and viewed them as a harmful new phenomenon which was to 58</page><page sequence="21">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah be categorically rejected. It is not surprising that the subject on which he chose to attack the kabbalists was the one which was most directly con- cerned with every-day religious practice rather than one relating to the theoretical or theological innovations of the kabbalists. Rabbi Meir's description of the Jewish mystics as representing a mythological and polytheistic revival within Judaism was echoed throughout the ages, and nineteenth century scholars especially repeated it very often.50 Yet, while Scholem used this document to learn some im- portant details concerning the early kabbalah, the most striking point about this letter is its loneliness. During the next two centuries, when the kabbalah became better and better known among Jewish intellectuals, we hardly find a second opposing voice to join to that of Rabbi Meir's. These basic characteristics-the esoteric circles of the kabbalists, their strict orthodoxy and their fortification of practical observance of Jewish traditional commandments, the prominence of great halachists among the teachers of kabbalah-all these were factors which facilitated the ac- ceptance of the kabbalah as one more feature or aspect of Jewish culture without arousing controversy. It is doubtful whether all those familiar with the kabbalah believed it to be the true "secrets of the Torah" revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai, but their doubts did not bring them to active opposition because it was difficult to show what harm was done by its teachings. VII Scholem presented the early kabbalah in the Provence and Gerona in two different, but complementary, historical perspectives. On the one hand, these late-twelfth-century and thirteenth-century mystics were both the product of the culture in which they found themselves and those who contributed to its changes. Everything found in the works of these mystics is profoundly connected to the spiritual world of the early thirteenth century and the major developments within and surrounding Judaism at that time. The three main spiritual drives which Scholem discerned were: a) the Catharic heresy, the renewed gnostic revolution within Euro- pean Christianity; b) the impact of neo-Platonism, both Christian and Jewish; c) the impact of Aristotelian philosophy and the threat that ex- treme rationalism presented to traditional religious beliefs and practices. The kabbalists probably were influenced by the first movement, com- pletely absorbed the second, and fiercely opposed the third while offering a profound, traditional, Jewish alternative to it. In every way these kabbalists participated in the historical develop- ments and cultural trends of their day. Many of them wrote Jewish legal treatises, commentaries on the Bible and the Talmud, responsa on ha- 59</page><page sequence="22">Joseph Dan lachic questions, traditional ethical works based on talmudic and mid- rashic sayings, and other such accepted literary genres. There was nothing revolutionary in their writings either in form or in content. They did initiate new trends, but they did not do it first and foremost as kabbalists but, rather, as Jewish intellectuals and social leaders responding to the needs of the times. It seems that most of them did not devote all their energies to mystical speculation even though it was central to their spiritual and religious experience. The figure of the mystic who is nothing but a mystic can be found at this period only as an exception rather than as the rule. Only later did the kabbalah develop until "kabbalist" became a term which can describe the totality of an author's life and work. At the same time that these circles of mystics were developing their systems of symbols and responding to the cultural demands of their times they can be viewed, historically, in a much larger perspective, and Scholem complemented the first picture with the second. The appearance of the kabbalah in twelfth and thirteenth century Europe was nothing short of a major revolution. The mysticism of the Hekhalot and Merkabah literature, i.e., the mysticism of the talmudic era, seemingly forgotten as a living force outside the schools of the Ashkenazi Hasidism, suddenly acquired a new vigor and became central, in a much changed form, in a new and dynamic system of symbols. Gnostic tendencies, either inherent in this literature or transmitted independently by other means, suddenly erupted within the major academies of Jewish law in Southern Europe. Scholem's presentation of the history of these chapters in the develop- ment of the kabbalah reflects his deep belief in historical continuity. Indeed there is a linear element in his reconstruction from early Jewish mysticism in the East to the Jewish mystics in the Provence, where first the Book Bahir appeared and then the scholars, who had visions of Elijah's ap- pearance to them, developed the system of kabbalistic emanations on the basis of the Bahir. This was transmitted to the Gerona scholars, from whom the mystical system spread to other centers in Spain. Some enigmas still exist in this picture, such as the problem of the participation of the Ashkenazi Hasidim in the transmitting of Eastern esoteric gnostic ma- terial, and the problem of the Iyyun circle and its place in the chain of de- velopment of Jewish mysticism in Europe. But on the whole, according to Scholem, there is one stream that leads from Hekhalot Zutartey to the Bahir and from it to Rabbi Isaac the Blind's commentary on the Sefer Yezirah and from there to the works of Rabbi Azriel of Gerona and Nach- manides, and onwards to other mystical circles until the Zohar incor- porated all of them and brought Jewish theosophy and mythological symbolism to a new level of richness, sophistication and historical impact.51 The most meaningful result of these studies by Scholem, from a his- torical point of view, is that he conclusively demonstrated that it is impossible to separate the history of Jewish mysticism from the history of 60</page><page sequence="23">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah Jewish culture and religion. The mystics of the Provence and Gerona were not isolated individuals but played a central role, even excluding the mystical dimension apparent in their work, in the unfolding of Jewish culture at that time. As he had done concerning the Hekhalot mysticism, i.e., forcing us to acknowledge that it is impossible to separate it from the world of the talmudic and midrashic sages, so, once again, he has in the case of the early kabbalists in Europe revealed them to be an integral part of the culture and literature of their time, their mysticism being an added dimension which contributes tremendously to the understanding of the whole. Scholem, through his brilliant historical and philological analyses of pertinent texts, has incontrovertibly shown that mysticism is a constantly operating force (though not always with the same strength), in Jewish history. He described the appearance of the kabbalah in Europe as a mythological explosion in the heart of medieval Judaism. But the forces which caused this explosion were not new; they emanated from the con- stant and enduring mystical dimension of the Jewish religion. HEBREW UNIVERSITY NOTES 1. See, for instance, H.

In this paper Scholem published a letter by Rabbi Isaac the Blind to Gerona, and several other documents, to be mentioned below. From Scholem's analysis it becomes evident that Rabbi Isaac was asked by the Gerona kabbalists to come to them, and while declining he did send his nephew, Rabbi Asher ben David, to instruct them in kabbalistic problems and the right way for a kabbalist to behave in non-kabbalistic society. The works of Rabbi Asher ben David were published by Rav Avida in ha-Segulah, (1934), and re-published, with some additions, by me in my Early Kabbalistic Circles (Jerusalem, 1978) [Hebrew], with a bibliography of the manu- scripts by R. Elior. 9. Concerning the controversy see I. Baer, The History of the Jews in Christian Spain, (Tel Aviv, 1959) [Hebrew], p. 484 and J. Sarachek, Faith and Reason (Williamsport, 1935). Compare D.J.

The problem of Rabbi Jonah's attitude towards the kabbalah is a difficult one. Scholem presented the proof of his kabbalistic background in "A New Docu- ment Concerning the History of Early Kabbalah" (above, n. 8), but I. Tishby put forward the argument that the complete absence of kabbalistic ideas and ter- minology seems to indicate that the document does not refer to the author of the ethical works we have. See Tishby's Mishnat ha-Zohar, (Jerusalem, 1961), vol. II, pp. 657-658 [Hebrew]. Concerning the works of Rabbi Jonah see J. Dan, Ethical and Homiletical Literature (Jerusalem, 1975), pp. 155-159 [Hebrew]. It seems to me that further analysis of the attitude of the Gerona kabbalists to ethical literature proves that Rabbi Jonah was indeed a kabbalist, and the norms of his school tended to make him mask his mystical views in his ethical works; he was more successful in this than the other kabbalists in Gerona who wrote ethical works. See a detailed discussion of this in my forthcoming Jewish Ethics and Jewish Mys- ticism, ch. II, University of Washington Press. 13.

See his paper "Netivey Hagsha- mah ve-Hafshata ba-Kabbalah" ("Paths of Mythologization and Systematization in the Kabbalah"), in his collection of papers, Netivey Emunah u-Minut ("Paths of Faith and Heresy"), (Ramat-Gan, 1964), pp. 15-29. 19. Concerning en sof, see Scholem, Kabbalah, 88-91, and Ursprung undAnfdnge der Kabbala, 230-239. 20. See Scholem, Kabbalah, pp. 92-115. 21. A brief discussion was presented by Scholem in the first lecture in Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York, 1941), pp. 25-28. Compare D. Biale, Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History (Cambridge, 1979), passim. 22. See Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 62. 23. The term appears in the works of the followers of the tradition of Joseph ben Uzziel. See J. Dan, Early Kabbalistic Circles, pp. 99-106. 24. Compare J. Dan, The Esoteric Theology of the Ashkenazi Hasidim (Jerusalem, 1968), pp. 136-140 [Hebrew]. 25. Scholem often used the term "transparency" to describe the effect of the symbol on the symbolized realm: the symbol makes the partition hiding the sym- bolized mystery somewhat more transparent thus enabling the mystic to have some vague outlines of the hidden truth. See Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, pp. 26-27. 26. The interpretation of the first verse of Genesis was one of the most popular subjects in kabbalistic literature throughout the ages and there are hundreds of such exegetical commentaries. The example given above is only one among many, though it is typical of their attitude. Even from the school of Rabbi Isaac the Blind we have several treatises dealing with this subject besides his detailed discussion in the Commentary to Sefer Yezirah. Thus we have a brief description of the creation by Rabbi Asher ben David and one, very similar, by Rabbi Joseph ben Shmuel which is included in Rabbi Jacob ben Sheshet's polemical work, Meshiv Devarim Nechochim which was published by G. Vajda with an introduction by E. Gottlieb, (Jerusalem, 1969). See especially p. 193 of this text. See also con- cerning the whole subject E. Gottlieb, Studies in Kabbalah, pp. 62-70, and my Hebrew paper in the Shlomo Pines Jubilee Volume (forthcoming). 27. It is not my intention in this essay to deal with the intriguing question whether Gershom Scholem did or did not believe in any of the ideas of the kabbalists, nor with the question whether he himself was mystically inclined or not. It seems that while everyone accepts that, for example, one can devote a 63</page><page sequence="26">Joseph Dan lifetime to the study of Plato without being a Platonist one cannot study mysticism without being, to some extent, a mystic himself. The scholar in the field of mysticism is required to account for his choice of field of scholarship while his colleagues in other fields are free of this obligation. Scholem's attitude was most complex and profound, but, and it should be stated emphatically, his personal attitude did not influence the results of his textual and philological investigations. As the notes in this essay show, almost every problem that Scholem discussed has been studied and re-studied by other scholars in the last four decades and his conclusions tested by detailed, detached scholarly review. 28. See Scholem's detailed discussion of this problem in: On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism (New York, 1965), pp. 5-32. 29. J. Dan, Ethical and Homiletical Literature, pp. 47-68, and bibliography on pp. 281-282. 30. See Scholem, Kabbalah, p. 36. 31. The material concerning the philosopher's attitude towards the command- ments was compiled and presented in volume I of J. Heinemann's, Ta'amey ha- Mitsvot be-Sifrut Yisrael (Jerusalem, 1954) [Hebrew]. 32. Concerning the views of the Ashkenazi Hasidim towards the spiritualiza- tion of the commandments see J. Dan, Ethical and Homiletical Literature, pp. 134-144. 33. A monumental study of the concepts of the mitsvot in the kabbalah was made by I. Tishby in the second volume of his Mishnat ha-Zohar (Jerusalem, 1961) [Hebrew], dedicated almost completely to the analysis of religious practice ac- cording to the Zohar and previous and subsequent kabbalistic views. It is in- teresting to note that Scholem did not dedicate a special study to this problem even though discussions of this subject are found in many of his papers and books. 34. Scholem stressed this aspect of the mysticism of the early kabbalists es- pecially when he compared it with messianic kabbalah which developed from the sixteenth century onwards. See his The Messianic Idea in the Kabbalah and Other Essays (New York, 1971). 35. Compare A. Altmann's analysis of other conceptions of the "ladder of ascension" in his "The Ladder of Ascension" now reprinted in his Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism (Ithaca, 1969), pp. 41-72. 36. This attitude may explain the low profile that the kabbalists kept-at least as kabbalists-in the controversy against the works of Maimonides. It should be stressed, however, that main figures in the Gerona school of the kabbalah did devote central works to the struggle against philosophy. One of Nachmanides's sermons is an attack on the Aristotelian conception of the beginning of the world; see J. Dan, Ethical and Homiletical Literature, p. 159. Another important work is Rabbi Jacob ben Sheshet's polemical work, Meshiv Devarim Nechochim (see above, note 26), which is directed against Rabbi Shmuel Ibn Tibon's treatise on the crea- tion, Ma'mar Yiqavu ha-Mayim (Rabbi Shmuel is the celebrated translator of Maimonides, More Nevuchim [Guide of the Perplexed] into Hebrew). It is not an accident that these two polemical works deal with a refutation of the philosophi- cal conceptions of the creation, the sod ma'aseh bereshit. Similarly, the kabbalists kept a low profile as kabbalists in their ethical works, but their emphasis on tra- ditional, talmudic-midrashic ethics is both a polemic against and the suggestion of an alternative to philosophical rationalistic ethics. 64</page><page sequence="27">Scholem's Reconstruction of Early Kabbalah 37. A new analysis of the Bahir's attitude to the commandments is to be found in J. Katz's study in Tarbiz, vol. 51 (1981). 38. Published by Scholem in: "A New Document Concerning the History of Early Kabbalah." 39. A list and analysis of the works of Rabbi Ezra and Rabbi Azriel, including a clarification of their relationship to each other, was presented by I. Tishby in his introduction to Rabbi Azriel's Commentary on the Aggadot (Jerusalem, 19832) [Hebrew]. A large part of Scholem's The Kabbalah in Gerona is dedicated to these central kabbalists of the Gerona circle. See also Ursprung und Anfdnge der Kabbala, pp. 324-420. 40. Scholem's list was printed as an appendix to Reshit ha-Kabbalah, pp. 255-262. 41. See Scholem, Kabbalah, pp. 95-96, and compare J. Dan, Early Kabbalistic Circles, pp. 1-11. 42. Scholem used the Iyyun circle as the clearest example of the impact of European neo-Platonism on the kabbalah. See his: "The Footprints of Gabirol in the Kabbalah", MeasefSofrey Eretz Yisrael (Tel Aviv, 1940), pp. 160-178 [Hebrew]. 43. This subject has not been studied yet in all its aspects. See I. Gruenwald's Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (Leiden, 1980) for further discussion. 44. See Bahir sections 123-134. 45. Scholem, Reshit ha-Kabbalah, pp. 96-97, and compare J. Dan, The Emergence of the Mystical Prayer, pp. 107-110. 46. I. Tishby's edition of Rabbi Azriel's Commentary on the Agaddot, pp. 23-26. 47. T.B. Berachot 45a. 48. See volume II of Chavel's edition of the works of Nachmanides which includes the ha-Emunah veha-Bitahon, i.e., mistakenly attributes the work to Nach- manides. 49. Scholem, "A New Document Concerning the History of Early Kabbalah". 50. A typical example is the series of studies and books by Solomon Rubin. 51. This linear description of the development of the kabbalah is open to several questions which, in turn, raises the possibility of a different interpretation. For instance, it is not at all certain that the early kabbalists in the Provence received all their symbols from the Book Bahir. Indeed, it is surprising how in- dependent they are in their terminology compared to the Bahir, and most of their symbols are not based on it. If this is accepted then it is possible that they had another source for their symbols, i.e., the Bahir was not the only ancient pre- sentation of a symbolism containing ten divine attributes. In a similar way, the texts of the Iyyun circle which do not contain terminology dependent on the Bahir seem to denote the existence of mystical systems which used other sources and developed outside, or beside, this "linear" historical stream. If so then some of the more mystically oriented circles of the Ashkenazi Hasidim should be viewed as independent mystical schools, emerging without close contact or direct influ- ence from the main stream of mystical development presented by Scholem. It seems that today we have a meaningful body of historical facts which indicate that at the turn of the thirteenth century nearly half a dozen independent schools of Jewish mystics operated in Europe. The centrality of the Bahir-Provence- Gerona line is a historical fact decided by later developments, but at the time there were many contemporary alternatives to that line. From a historical point of view this picture raises with a new force the question: 65</page><page sequence="28">66 Joseph Dan Why exactly then? That is, why could Judaism flourish for such a long time without the symbolism of several divine emanations and then suddenly, around the year 1200, give rise to half a dozen schools all of which felt the need to invent new symbols and new mythologies to describe the Godhead? The study of this question might well add new insights into the nature of the relationship between the larger Jewish religious situation and Jewish mysticism. It would also, almost certainly, add to our understanding of Jewish culture in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. See J. Dan, Early Kabbalistic Circles, for a detailed review of the problem of the independence of these many mystical circles. In addition, for more on this perplexing issue, see J. Dan, The Emergence of Mystical Prayer, p. 115.</page></plain_text>
