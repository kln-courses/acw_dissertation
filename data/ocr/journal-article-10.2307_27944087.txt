<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN EVALUATION OF GORDON KAUFMAN'S THEOLOGICAL PROPOSAL James Beilby / Marquette University Immanuel Kant has profoundly affected many areas of academic discourse, not the least of which is the field of theological and religious studies. It is not an overstatement to say that vast stretches of the contemporary theological landscape reflect, if not the substance of Kant's work, at least his formulation of the fundamental problems, questions, and issues. One contemporary theo logian whose work has been profoundly influenced by Kant is Gordon Kauf man.1 In this paper, I will evaluate Kaufman's theological proposal. I pro pose to look at Kaufman's project in two ways: diachronically and synchro nically. It is my belief that some of the fundamental features of Kaufman's thought will emerge in the course of a discussion of the development of his concept of God.2 I believe that the strong influence of Kant on the early Kauf man and Kant's waning influence in his later thought will be revelatory of an important trajectory in his project. With the evolution of Kaufman's theology as background, I will turn to a discussion and evaluation of the "pillars" of 1 That Kaufman was directly influenced by Kant is beyond question. However, it is also clear that Kaufman was influenced by Kant in a more roundabout fashion. In the preface to his first book, Relativism, Knowledge, and Faith (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1960), Kaufman acknowledges that his thought was guided "to a far greater extent than the footnotes suggest" by William Dilthey, R. G. Collingwood, and Paul Tillich (xii), two neo Kantians and a Schellingian. (See William Dean, "The Persistence of Experience: A Commentary on Gordon Kaufman's Theology," in New Essays in Religious Naturalism, eds. W. Creighton Peden and Larry E. Axel [Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1993], 68). 2 Kaufman's primary works are: Relativism, Knowledge, and Faith; The Context of Decision (Nashville: Abingdon, 1961); Systematic Theology: A Historicist Perspective (New York: Scribner, 1969); God the Problem (Cambridge, MA.: Harvard University Press, 1972); An Essay on Theological Method, Spedition (Atlanta, GA: Scholars Press, 1995, [1975, 1979]); The Theological Imagination: Constructing the Concept of God (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1981); Theology for a Nuclear Age (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1985); In Face of Mystery: A Constructive Theology (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1993); and God?Mystery?Diversity: Christian Theology in a Pluralistic World (Min neapolis: Fortress, 1996). 123</page><page sequence="2">124 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Kaufman's theological edifice. In the process, I will suggest that there are fondamental and perhaps unreconcilable problems with Kaufman's project. I. Kaufman's Theological Evolution A. Neo-Orthodox Constructivism (1960-1970) rom the beginning, Kaufman's work has revolved around the set of A questions and problems associated with the relativizing influences of history and culture. Kaufman's early work is characterized by three fonda mental features: a Kantian philosophical theology, a strong emphasis on the historical-cultural embeddedness of all thought and knowledge, and a neo orthodox understanding of revelation. In Relativism, Knowledge, and Faith, Kaufman follows Kant's Copernican revolution in holding that all we know is based on our forms of knowing.3 However, unlike Kant, for Kaufman our forms of knowing are historical and cultural, and therefore do not have the universality and necessity that they have for Kant.4 Because Relativism is fundamentally an exposition of the epistemic predicament in which Kaufman believes humans find them selves, in it can be found the framework of his historicist epistemology that continues to inform his thought right up to the present day. In Relativism Kaufman stresses the fact that humans construct comprehensive "visions of reality." However, the historical location of all thought entails that these en compassing "world-views" are formed by a process of "imaginative con struction."5 The fondamental question posed in Relativism, the very same question which animates much of his later thought, is how do humans, despite their radically historical nature, attain knowledge and truth.6 3 Kaufman, Relativism, Knowledge, and Faith, 35. 4 Ibid, 51. 5 Ibid., 35; Systematic Theology, xv.

In it, Kaufman articulates a systematic philosophical theology and attempts to sketch a neo-orthodox historicist response to the set of problems articulated in Relativism. In Systematic Theology we see articu lated a notion of knowledge of God which is strongly Kantian. Kaufman fol lows Kant in his rejection of both experiential religious epistemologies and natural theology.7 He also begins his project with the Kantian transcendental claim that the God-concept is universal and indispensable.8 Lastly, again fol lowing Kant, Kaufman argues that God is, by definition, beyond experience, and as such, language about God is a highly problematic notion. His response to the problem of God-talk is the defining characteristic of his early work, and stands in sharp contrast to his later work. His answer has two features. First, Kaufman emphasizes the fact that Christ is the unifying historical event for the Christian vision of reality, and through God's saving acts, especially as manifested in Christ, the church can/should become "a witness to God's love" and "the channel through which that love flows to the rest of the world."9 Second, his christological focus implies his reliance on the interpretation of the past?specifically, one's own tradition?for resolving the problems associated with the concept of God. Thus, at this stage, despite his historicism which leads him to claim that knowledge is a kind of imaginative construction and his Kantianism which leads him to disparage rational (or to use a term more faithful to Kant, speculative) knowledge of God, Kaufman continues to maintain the impor tance of revelation. For Kaufman, divine revelation, "unlike other knowledge, includes an element beyond imaginative construction; for revelation is the process whereby the self received a positive self-disclosure from a personal God who is beyond human history."10 debate between skepticism/dogmatism. 7 Kaufman, Systematic Theology, 109-112. 8 Wayne Proodfoot, "Regulae fidei and Regulative Idea: Two Contemporary Theological Strategies," in Theology at the End of Modernity: Essays in Honor of Gordon D.

The Methodological Revolution (1971-1975) Even before Systematic Theology appeared in print, Kaufman had become uncomfortable with what he saw as problematic assumptions and con ceptual problems embedded in it.11 Even though he had intended it to be an "interpretation of the Christian faith within the limits of reason alone,"12 he came to see that "many central issues connected with the question of God were being begged "13 The impetus behind this realization is no doubt a complicated affair, but Kaufman himself identifies two fundamental factors: the "God is dead" movement of the early 1960s, and the "critique by analytic philosophers of the meaning of theological language."14 For Kaufman, [if God-talk is to remain meaningful] we must find ways of conceiving the nature which scientists interpret, and the historico-cultural process which is the province of the his torians?as well as our ordinary day-by-day experience ?as permeable to divine purposive activity; we must see the world as a whole, and our Uves in particular, as rooted in and governed by divine intentionality and agency. At the present it is doubtful whether such modes of thought are even possible for us any more.15 Behind this statement, one cannot help but hear the specter of Kant's "Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysic" and his "noumena-phenomena" distinction, but even more vividly, Feuerbach's adaptation of Kantian philo sophical theology by which God-talk is a "projection or externalization of the 11 Systematic Theology was published "three or four years after it had been substantially completed" (Kaufman, "Some Reflections," 179). 12 Systematic Theology, xiii. 13 Kaufman, "Some Reflections," 179. 14 Ibid., 178. By "analytic philosophers" I can only assume that Kaufman means logical positivists such as A. J. Ayer, Rudolf Carnap, and Antony Flew, and that their "critique" is the Verification Criterion of Meaning. 15 Kaufman, "What Shall We Do With the Bible?" Interpretation 25 (1971), 111.</page><page sequence="5">_Vol. 20, No. 2, May 1999_127 human, which is then understood as something outside the human."16 Another feature of Kaufman's immanent methodological shift, un doubtedly concomitant with the first, is his growing discomfort with the entire idea of divine revelation. With his doubts about the validity of the traditional notion of God as a personal being, he also became intensely skeptical about the possibility of divine revelation, a concept "intimately bound to the concept of God as a personal being."17 The result of these worries about the meaning of the God-concept is expressed in the pivotal essay in God the Problem, "God as Symbol." In this essay, the referent of the term "God" is dichotomized into the "real" referent, "always an unknown X, a mere limiting idea with no content" and the avail able referent, our imaginative construct of God.18 While, at this point, Kauf man does not fully delve into the conceptual implications of this move, he will later look back on this essay as "foreshadow[ing] to some extent" his im manent methodological shift.19 For the time being, he continues to maintain that the notion of God is both "a construct of the human imagination" and "an objective reality,"20 and assuages the apparent conflict by an appeal to the "highly dialectical" nature of the notion of God.21 Later, Kaufman would look back on his attempt in God the Problem to "fill the holes" created by Systematic Theology as only opening "wider breaches,"22 and thus necessitating the writing of a book which he considers "the most important contribution of my methodological work."23 Although Kaufman calls Essay in Theological Method a sequel to God the Problem 16 Kaufman, '"God-talk' after 'Death of God* " New Review of Books and Religion /10 (June 1978): 3. 17 Douglas F.

Essay is a sequel to God the Problem in that Kaufman continues to work out the problematic identified in God the Problem. However, Essay is more accurately construed as the amplification and extension, and in so doing, radicalization, of one particular essay in God the Problem, "God as Symbol."25 According to Kaufinan, Essay "turned upside down the basic pattern of thinking underlying Systematic Theology"26 in that in it he moves away from viewing traditional theological symbols, concepts, and norms as a theo logical resource. Instead, in Essay he emphasizes that "theology is (and always has been) essentially a constructive activity." Therefore, since "ultimate loyalty" ought to be given to God rather than the ideas of any particular tra dition, "theologians dare no longer to simply take over symbols and concepts from earlier generations merely because they have been handed down to us in the Bible and tradition."27 Therefore, for Kaufinan, "God" ceased to be ap propriately thought of as "a reality over against us, totally other from us at all." Instead, the God-concept is a construct of the human imagination which performs certain important functions in our thinking and our experience.28 Kaufinan attributes this insight to Kant: "With Kant, the issue at last becomes clarified: God must be understood as a human construct, doubtless a very im portant, perhaps indispensable construct, but a human construct nonethe less."29 Thus, Essay marks the shift from dialectical referentiality, and hence realism (even in an attenuated sense) to nonrealism. Kaufinan is clear about the implications of his constructivist views for the theological task: To say theology is largely constructive activity does not mean that it is empty or untrue or dealing with the unreal. A world we create is no less real that one which is given to us. ... Once we realize that all notions like "ultimate reality" or 25 Indeed, later Kaufman would look back at the work done prior to Essay as "pre-critical" (In Face of Mystery, 492 n. 1.

Theologians must, claims Kaufman, move beyond the "first-order theology" of trying to "set forth as adequately as possible a picture of God, humankind and the world as they are" and the "second-order theology" of inquiring into the grounds or justification for accepting one construction as compared to another, and move to the third-order theology of acknowledging that "all theological positions are rooted fundamentally in imaginative construction" and working to "take control (so far as possible) of these constructions so as to develop theological positions to which thoughtful contemporary men and women can give themselves."31 In other words, first order theology is the attempt to depict reality, second-order theology is the attempt to construct concepts which, though they do not depict reality, are appropriate to it, and third-order theology is the attempt to construct concepts commensurate with a goal other than "reference to an external reality"?in Kaufman's case, "palatability to the contemporary human mind."32 For Kaufman, the move from first-order to second-order theology is necessitated by the fact that "the increasing encounter of world cultures" and the "development of sciences such as cultural anthropology and the sociology of knowledge and religion" have produced a level of intellectual sophistication which makes first-order theology "no longer a viable alternative."33 On the other hand, the move from second-order to third-order theology is required by the fact that second-order theology by itself "is not adequate to meet the needs 30 Ibid, 32-33. Portions of this quote, included in the first edition of Essay, were deleted in later editions. I am unsure why this is so as their deletion does not affect the overall meaning of the portion of the text in which they are found. I have chosen to quote this text as it appears in the first edition despite Kaufman's apparent dissatisfaction with it because I feel that it clearly states one of the fundamental issues at work at this stage of Kaufman's thought. 31 Ibid., 45-47 (italics Kaufman's). 32 Ibid., 47. 33 Ibid.</page><page sequence="8">130_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ for orientation in life: it leaves us with a chaos of conflicting claims and criteria rather than guidance in the ordering and orienting of our lives."34 Using this conceptual tool, the methodological difference between God the Problem and Essay becomes clear. In God the Problem, I suggest, Kaufman was still doing second-order theology. In true Kantian fashion, he was trying to justify his construction of God by reference to the ethical or pragmatic. In nstruing God as the anchor-symbol for a vision of life, he was adopting a fundamentally practical, as opposed to speculative, standard of theological construction.35 Therefore, the appropriateness of one theological construction as opposed to another in God the Problem is determined with respect to moral questions, for example, What ought I do? How ought I comport myself?36 This move, as Kaufman acknowledges, closely parallels Kant's affirmation of the existence of God as a postulate of pure practical reason.37 However, in Essay, Kaufman clearly makes the move toward third order theology (even if he does not fully "flesh out" this move until later). While he continues, in a Kantian fashion, to ground his theological con structions in the practical, or more specifically, in the ethical realm, he diverges from Kant in his claim that these constructions are not said to correspond to extra-mental reality in any way. Instead, Kaufman judges the "construction" of God-concepts ethically, as either fulfilling or failing to fulfill "human development" or "humanization." Unlike Kaufman, and despite his transcendental idealism and skepticism about the noumenal realm, Kant thought that quite a number of things could be predicated of God. If this is so, then it may be said that Kaufman follows Kant in his second-order theology, but goes "beyond" Kant in his third-order theology. Thus, the result of Kaufman's real/available referent distinction is a move in a strongly immanent direction. This immanent move, the move toward third-order theology, is something that Kaufman spent his next two books, Theological Imagination and Theology for a Nuclear Age, developing. 34 Ibid., 46. 35 Kaufman, God the Problem, 100. 36 Ibid. 37 "This entire section of the present essay is heavily indebted to Kant's analysis" in the Critique of Practical Reason (God the Problem, 101 n. 21).</page><page sequence="9">Vol. 20, No. 2, May 1999 C. Nonrealist Constructivism (1976-1985) 131 There are two differences between Kaufman's thought in God the Problem and Essay on the one hand and Theological Imagination and Theology for a Nuclear Age on the other. The first is what might be called confidence of assertion. God the Problem and Essay are put forth in what Kaufman calls then and later a "tentative" manner.38 A number of scholars have noted a degree of apprehension in Essay and especially in God the Problem ?apprehension which is the hallmark of a writer in transition.39 The second difference is structural or formal. While God the Problem and Essay are primarily methodological in nature, Theological Imagination and Theology for a Nuclear Age constitute the explication and development of that revolutionary theological methodology. Two aspects of Kaufman's methodological revolution stand out as particularly important.40 The first is the notion of "imagination" and the second is Kaufman's "criterion of humanization." I will address each in turn. "Imagination" has a long and distinguished history in philosophy from Aristotle to the British Empiricists. However, it was Kant who made it an important part of the furniture of his Copernican revolution, and it is Kant's notion of imagination that I suggest has impacted, both directly and indirectly, Kaufman's theological proposal. For Kant, the imagination is the power through which the categories order the material of intuition and in so doing make a unified conception of the world possible. This expression was coopted for an historicist agenda by R. G. Collingwood who suggested that historians use their "historical imagination" to reconstruct from the sources events which are not explicitly or accurately referred to.41 In Kaufman's hands, the "theo 38 Kaufman, God the Problem, xi; Theological Imagination, 11. 39 Dean, 70; Green, 219. 40 In this section, I deviate from a pure diachronic analysis slightly. I will postpone discussion on a topic which, although important at this phase of Kaufman's thought, does not receive full expression until the next phase. The topic I am referring to is Kaufman's continued struggle with the question of the appropriateness of personal as opposed to impersonal images of God. 41 R. G. Collingwood, The Idea of History, ed. T. M. Knox (New York: Oxford University Press, 1946), 231-249; cited by Kaufman in Systematic Theology, 71; cf. 366 . See also Froese, 13, n. 56.</page><page sequence="10">132_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ logical imagination" became the primary means by which theologians "construct" and/or "reconstruct" the concept of God, and in so doing rescue the concept from the lack of scientific sophistication and metaphysical naivete evinced by traditional accounts of God. Secondly, Kaufman fleshes out the immanent, anthropological move prefigured in Essay by reference to what he calls the "criterion of human iza?on" Remember, for Kaufman, the hallmark of third-order theology is that the theologian constructs notions of God palatable to the human mind. Accordingly, the proper, and indeed, necessary goal of theology is now construed in unequivocally anthropological, humanistic terms. The central problem facing the present generation is the construction of a genuinely humane order?lest we destroy ourselves completely. If theological reflection is to be justified in this crisis, it must contribute to this work. A theology that makes essential contributions to our human ization is the only sort we can afford today.42 Consequently, theological constructions are deemed appropriate or valid if and only if they address the issues, questions, and concerns of contemporary humans. In other words, theological constructions, instead of being evaluated by correspondence to an external reality, are judged by the "forms of life that they make possible." Kaufman's shorthand for this matter is they are judged by the "criterion of humanization."43 The question about the validity or truth of a theistic frame of orientation is the question about the degree to which it reflects the actual situation of human existence and thus opens up the possibility for persons and communities to come to fiill(er) realization (i.e., to "salvation").... To see 42 Kaufman, TheologicalImagination, 168. 43 Davaney, "Directions in Historicism: Language, Experience, and Pragmatic Adjudication," m New Essays in Religious Naturalism, eds. W. Creighton Peden &amp; Larry E. Axel (Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1993) 52-53. Kaufman develops the criterion of humanization in many places (Essay, 32,54; Theological Imagination, 168ff, 182ff, 187-191,205).</page><page sequence="11">_Vol 20, No. 2, May 1999_133 [the possibility for "salvific" humanization] as ultimately normative for human existence is to hold them to be grounded in and expressive of "reality" in a way not true of significantly different modes of life. Speech about the Christian God as "real" or "existent" expresses symbolically this conviction that free, loving persons-in-community, have a substantial metaphysical foundation, that there are cosmic forces working toward this sort of humanization.44 Thus construed, Kaufman's "God" serves a dual function. Because of its imaginative or constructive nature, the God-concept serves to relativize all human life and effort?reminding humans that they are not ultimate, and that pretensions to ultimate knowledge are idolatrous. Secondly, Kaufinan's God serves to ground all forms of humaneness?"the symbol God has embodied the conviction that humanity is of value, and that that from which humanity is originated and is sustained is supportive of human possibility and meaning."45 Therefore, in Theological Imagination and Theology for a Nuclear Age, Kaufman has moved to a robust form of nonrealism. Conceptualizations of God are not only "constructed" by the imagination, the criterion by which such constructions are judged are anthropological rather than ontological. Moreover, the fact that Kaufman uses the criterion of humanization to judge all theological constructions coupled with his construal of the human self in solely evolutionary and hence naturalistic terms gives his theological imagination a strong, almost irresistible naturalistic impetus. [W]e must now conceive God in terms appropriate to our modern understanding of ourselves and the world. ... [As such], God should be today conceived in terms of the complex of physical, biological and historico-cultural con ditions which have made human existence possible, which continue to sustain it, and which may draw it out to fuller 44 Kaufman, Theological Imagination, 48,49. 45 Sheila GreeveDavaney, 'Directions in Historicism," in New Essays in Religious Naturalism, 54..</page><page sequence="12">134 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy humanity and humaneness.46 It is this trend toward naturalism that will comprise the final section of my consideration of Kaufman's theological development. D. Naturalist Constructivism (1986-Present) ven as Kaufman was working out the theological implications of his JL/methodological revolution, he was hovering around another fundamental issue with the power to instigate yet another "paradigm shift" in his thought. This issue involved his increasing affinity toward naturalism. Moreover, I contend, it is this move that carries him farther away from his Kantian roots and closer to naturalists in the classical American tradition such as John Dewey and Henry Nelson Wieman.47 The impetus behind this shift was a familiar one, namely his questions about the coherence and utility of personal notions of God. Just as his doubts about the coherence of a personal God contributed to his rejection of divine revelation, and subsequently instigated his methodological revolution, now this very issue instigates a powerful move toward naturalism. While in Essay he professed the need to maintain the use of personalistic talk of God,48 in Theological Imagination and Theology for a Nuclear Age he becomes increasingly suspicious about such talk.49 Even in the early 1980s there is the nascent beginning of a preference for impersonal as opposed to personal imagery of God. Even so, for the time being Kaufman continues to qualify his af firmation of naturalistic imagery. In fact, he argues that there are irreconcilable differences between the Christian specification of God and impersonal concepts of nature.50 Positively, he suggests that personal imagery provides a concrete and intuitive image, and hence "can readily become the central focus for devotion and service."51 Therefore, while personalistic imagery continues 46 Kaufman, Theology for a Nuclear Age, 42. 47 Dean, 68. 48 Kaufman, Essay, 52. 49 Kaufman, Theological Imagination, 58-79; 209-237. 50 Ibid., 224-227. 51 Ibid., 50.</page><page sequence="13">_Vol. 20, No. 2, May 1999_135 to have organizational and explanatory power for Kaufman, he is quick to affirm that such imagery, specifically the notion of God as an agent, will have to be reexamined "in light of contemporary evolutionary theory"52 and in light of the contemporary "nuclear eschatology." Moreover, the method that he uses to hold together the dialectic between the personal and impersonal is illumi native. Instead of attempting to find ways to carefully articulate coherent and relevant personalistic notions of God, he bases the success of appropriating basic theological concepts on the possibility of understanding nature as more purposive and personal. Natural evolutionary processes, thus imbued with a teleology and historicity which is intertwined with the evolution and history of humanity, can be referred to in personal terms.53 One cannot help but get the idea here that, while Kaufman still believes that personalistic imagery has a function, it is only as an adjutant or clarificatory tool for naturalistic imagery which apparently "better represents" (at least to the contemporary mind) the God-concept?if for no other reason, because it does not have to be "de-reified of anthropomorphic encrustation in order to be understood properly."54 However before long, even the anthropological expediency of personal imagery becomes attenuated by his problems with such talk. I am doubtful, however, if metaphors or models based pri marily on the human person are adequate any longer to serve as the principle foundation for our conception of God; for in our world personal being is understood to be not the source or ground of the highly complex evolutionary, histor-ical, and social processes of which we are aware, but rather their product. We, therefore, no longer have a way of thinking of personal reality?more specifically, of a person?as grounding the whole of reality.... [I]t may be that concepts like "evolutionary process" or "life" or "creativity" or "universe" must be given centrality instead of powerfully evocative personal images of the sort that Sallie McFague 52 Ibid., 228-230. 53 Ottati, 223. 54 Eddy, 25.</page><page sequence="14">136_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ (along with our ancient traditions) has suggested.55 Personal notions of God, claims Kaufinan, are the result of the "reification" of our own experience, thoughts, and ideas and must be "de-reified." In In Face of Mystery, Kaufinan fully articulates his increasingly naturalistic theology. The world is not a structured order in which evolution happens to occur; the world is the cosmic evolutionary process.56 Such a statement clarifies another fundamental impetus in Kaufman's move toward naturalism. Remember, the criterion of humanization is Kaufman's method for judging the adequacy of theological imaginative constructions. However, since Kaufman construes anthropology and humaneness in starkly evolutionary terms, it is not surprising that his own theological constructions should trend in a naturalistic direction. (Indeed, given his theological anthropology, it would be extremely surprising if they did not.) In addition, in Mystery Kaufinan begins to clarify and focus his naturalistic language, locating divinity not in the whole evolutionary process, but in the "serendipitous creativity" within it.57 With the advent of the notion of serendipitous creativity as his focal conception of God, Kaufinan is even more forthright in his affirmation of naturalism. "We should, in our attempt to construct conceptions and pictures of humanity, the world, and God, try to speak only in terms of this world, of the realities of this life"5* Kaufman's method of baptizing his identification of God and evolutionary serendipitous creativity is to refer to the "trinitarian emphasis on the interconnectedness of all that is."59 The result of Kaufman's trend toward naturalism is somewhat ironic. In naturalism, Kaufinan is afforded the opportunity to speak realistically and 55 Kaufman, "Models of God," 17, italics Kaufman's. In addition, Kaufman finds such imagery guilty of "metaphysical naivete" and of provision of "repressive and oppressive power" by white male-dominated social institutions ("Reconstructing the Concept of God: De-reifying the Anthropomophisms," in The Making and Remaking of Christian Doctrine, eds., Sarah Coakley and David A.

From the point of view of faith such symbols as "creator" and "lord" refer to something "real"?for us today it will be the evolutionary and historical processes which produces us.61 The result is, as Kaufman admits, a robust version of theological naturalism.62 IL An Evaluation of Gordon Kaufman's Theological Edifice Itake it that the former section was sufficient to sketch the main features of Kaufman's theological development. I now turn from a diachronic to a synchronie analysis. In so doing I will seek to distill from the previous sections the main "pillars," or, if you will, "building materials" of Kaufman's theo logical edifice and critically evaluate them. The primary building materials of Kaufman's theological edifice, comprising, one might say, the foundation, walls, and roof, respectively, are his: (1) theological skepticism, (2) criterion of humanization, and (3) identi fication of God with serendipitous creativity. I will evaluate each of these in turn. A. Theological Skepticism Kaufman's theological skepticism, of course, is a skepticism about tra ditional notions of God. His skepticism is reflected in a rejection of natural theology and a rejection of divine revelation. Kaufman's rejection of natural theology is based (at least in part) on the popular contemporary notion that Hume and Kant have eviscerated the traditional arguments for the 60 "Kaufman's recent move to speak of God in naturalistic terms has been read by many, friends and critics alike, as a major shift toward more directly referential language of God" (Davaney, "Directions in Historicism," 56). 61 Kaufman, "Reconstructing," 103. 62 Kaufman, In Face of Mystery, 458.</page><page sequence="16">138_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ existence of God, and hence, no rational access to God's existence or nature is possible. However, contrary to the assumptions of many liberal and revisionist theologians, I suggest that natural theology has been defeated only in certain maximally ambitious forms. More moderate and sophisticated arguments for the existence of God are currently being propounded and discus sed in philosophical as well as theological circles. Consequently, perhaps it is better to see the traditional arguments for God's existence as?in the terminology of Maurice Wiles, a theologian who has received high praise from Kaufinan63?having "buckled, rather than broken."64 The arguments of natural theology, while failing to absolutely prove the existence of a divine being, and certainly failing to prove the existence of the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, do raise "genuine questions about the existence and intelligibility of [a purely naturalistic understanding of] the physical universe that ought not be dismissed out of hand as pseudo-questions."65 At the very least they, in Paul Tillich's words, "raise the question of God's existence" even if they do not provide the final answer to that question.66 Of course, Kaufman's theological skepticism is not motivated solely by the lack of convincing philosophical proofs for God's existence. Indeed, he deems the very notion of the existence of God as traditionally conceived to be fraught with insuperable difficulties. Of course, Kaufman's problem is not simply that an infinite God transcends our knowledge. The infinite ontological, moral, and epistemological difference between Creator and creation has always been a part of traditional conceptions of God. Instead, Kaufman's God, as traditionally conceived of, seems to be motivated by his belief that the real referent fails to be empirically verifiable: [The God-concept] is not to be identified with any particular finite reality.... ut if absolutely nothing within our experience can be directly identified as that to which the term "God" 63 Kaufman, "Reconstructing," 95. 64 Wiles, "Can Theology Still Be About God?," in Theology at the End of Modernity: Essays in Honor of Gordon D.

Ac ording to the Verification Criterion of Meaning, statements are meaningful if and only if they are empirically verifiable. However, the Verification Criterion of Meaning has retreated into the obscurity that it so richly deserves, at least in part because despite whatever intuitive plausibility it might possess, it suf ers the significant defect of being self-referentially incoherent. In other words, the statement "for a statement to be meaningful it must be empirically verifiable" is not itself empirically verifiable?it certainly does not directly correspond to anything within our experience. Under the apparent influence of Verificationism (an influence he acknowledges68) Kaufman seems to infer directly from the claim that nothing can be empirically, certainly, or uncontroversially established or verified con erning the real referent to the conclusion that God-talk is meaningless. However, suppose that none of our beliefs about God, indeed, none of our beliefs about anything at all, were certain in the Cartesian sense or guaranteed by divine imprimatur, would that necessarily call into question the possibility of their reference to an extra-mental reality? I can't see how it would.69 Indeed such an assertion would have a profoundly deleterious effect on Kaufman's own theology, much of which is not empirically verifiable, certain or uncontro ersial. The hallmark of Kaufman's religious epistemology in general, and his theological skepticism in particular, is his division of reference to God into the real and the available referent. For Kaufman (as for Kant on a "two worlds" reading of his critical project), there is a definite boundary between the humanly knowable and the humanly unknowable, between noumena and phenomena. "The real referent for 'god' is never accessible to us or in any way open to our observation or experience. It must remain always an unknown X, 67 Kaufman, God the Problem, 7 (italics mine). 68 Kaufman, "Some Reflections," 178. 69 A point nicely made by William Alston, "Realism and the Christian Faith," International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 38 (1995) 49. Here I must bypass a consideration of Kaufman's "dialogical" model of truth, a model which as Alston points out, seems to confuse truth and epistemic status (49-50).</page><page sequence="18">140 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy a mere limiting idea with no content."70 However, as intuitively plausible as this might seem, I believe that there is something deeply problematic about the very idea of a boundary in this context. Of course, the concept of a bound is not problematic; it is merely entailed by the concept of finitude. But a boundary, by definition, entails a "two-sidedness" to reality, corresponding, obviously, to the two sides of the boundary. But, what sense can be made of the notion of a boundary between the real referent and the available referent? If "items" on the "real referent side" of the boundary are truly unknowable and contentless, as Kaufman argues, how does he know that anything exists beyond that boundary? Doesn't he have to cross the "humanly uncrossable boundary" to know enough of real referent to know that it is contentless, and not approachable by normal human thought and categories? Kaufman claims that God is ultimate mystery, pure noumena, and that all our concepts only apply metaphorically.71 But how does Kaufinan know that our concepts do not refer to God? Even the claim that our concepts of God are at best metaphorical or symbolic entails that we have understood the concept of God sufficiently to realize that our concepts apply metaphorically at best.72 B. The Criterion of Humanization he notion of imaginative construction, to varying degrees, and under A varying guises, has been the hallmark of Kaufman's thought for nearly forty years. The notion of "the theological imagination" is not inherently problematic. Certainly, theology is in some respects a constructive enterprise. The fundamental question, however, is: What are the construction materials and techniques which guide that construction? or, in Kaufman's case, is the criterion of humanization the best "theological construction technique"? While the "criterion of humanization" sounds grandiose and magnanimous?indeed, who could object to promoting the cause of "human flourishing"??I have some serious misgivings about the content specified by the criterion of humanization and whether such a specification is in 70 Kaufman, God the Problem, 85. 71 Ibid., 95. 72 Nicholas Wolterstorf?

Modern Theology 14 (January 1998): 15.</page><page sequence="19">_Vol. 20, No. 2, May 1999_ 141 performative contradiction with the rest of Kaufman's project. First of all, I think that it is appropriate to ask what justifies Kaufman in making "the contemporary human mind" the "proper evaluator" of what theological notions are coherent and/or acceptable? Could it not be that the denizens of Kaufman's "contemporary society" are morally and episte mologically so distant from the faith-ideals of the early church that they cannot make sense of the God-concept? Thus, the most that Kaufman can argue is that, the God-concept does not make sense given the assumptions of contemporary secular society, and this argument is nowhere near as devastating as he takes it to be. However, even more problematic is the putative "referent" of Kauf man's "contemporary mind." One does not have to dig too far to find that, for Kaufman, the "contemporary mind" refers to (a) those involved in theological discourse within a university setting and who adopt certain self-critical stances and who are methodologically detached from any specific religious tradition,73 and, perhaps even more specifically, (b) to those committed to the advancement of a particular socio-political agenda.74 Moreover, in his stipulation of the criterion of humanization as the theological adjudicator, Kaufman himself participates in the very "Myth of the Given" that he repeatedly castigates. Why reify a scientific vision of humanity over against ecclesial or scriptural understandings? Paradoxically, his answer to this question is remarkably similar to a form of nineteenth-century evo utionary progressivism?a pattern of thought that he explicitly rejects. Humanity is "converging" and thus our theologies must take seriously the needs and desire of this converging humanity. What had been several quite distinct histories is today becoming one history, one world, one overarching universal civilization?doubtless with many subdivisions, many unique local colors and smells, many distinctive local practices, institutions and traditions, but all interconnected and interrelated in the on-moving all-inclusive tide of human history_[W]e are moving very rapidly toward one world: 73 Kmfman, God-Mystery-Diversity, 207,212. 74 Froese, 22.</page><page sequence="20">142_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ that is the great historical fact of our time, and our religious practices and theological reflection must adapt themselves to it.75 Evidently, religious and theological traditions that do not adapt themselves to this "all-inclusive tide of human history" will become "outmoded and super eded"76 However, this seems to me to be more than a little problematic. What justifies Kaufman in taking as most relevant and important that particular set of theological, anthropological, and social scientific issues that, for him, specifies the normative content of the criterion of humanization? Perhaps Kaufman believes that he is effecting a "retrieval" of the tradition in his definition of the "criterion of humanization" as the "secularization and universalization of certain fundamental Judeo-Christian themes."77 But, if so, not only may one question the faithfulness of his retrieval to the Judeo Christian tradition, one wonders how he might justify such a selective retrieval of the outmoded and metaphysically naive ideas of the past? Lastly, how does the specification of a specific content of the "criterion of humanization" fit with his assertion that "today we are forced to take with greater seriousness the fact that we do not know, and we can see no way which we will ever be able to plumb the true meaning of human life?or whether there even is such a thing."78 If the ultimate meaning of human life is beyond us (or nonexistent), why should we judge theological constructions by the criterion of humanization which necessarily specifies a particular under tanding of anthropology and meaning? What makes these, and only these particular notions appropriate to specifying the content of the criterion of humanization? I do not believe that Kaufman has (or, if he remains consistent, could) answer this charge. 75 Kaufman, In Face of Mystery, 119-20. 76 Ibid., 133; see also Delwin Brown, "Mystery and History in Kaufman's Theology," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 62 (Winter 1994): 1216. 77 Kaufman, Theological Imagination, 169. 78 Kaufman, "Evidentialism: A Theological Response," 43.</page><page sequence="21">Vol. 20, No. 2, May 1999 C. Serendipitous Creativity 143 While consideration of Kaufinan's recent thought might employ any one of many different evaluative tools or interpretive grids, I suggest that the most fruitful approach will be to emphasize his attempt to hold in balance the tension between the theological task construed nonrealistically as imagi ative construction and the theological task construed naturalistically as humanization. In other words, a fundamental nexus of Kaufman's theological program is located in the tension between God as produced by imaginative construction and God as referring to serendipitous creativity. But, how is it possible that God is both produced by humans (nonrealistically) and is specified (realistically) by reference to nature? The answer, I think, is that, through imaginative construction, Kaufman identifies serendipitous creativity with God. What is realistic about Kaufinan's God is its ontological, albeit natural, reality external to the knowing subject. What is nonrealist/imaginative about Kaufinan's God is the equation of God with naturalistic processes, and the fact that he does so not on the basis of the "divinity" of such processes, but because the identification of God with evolutionary processes serves a theological function; namely, it fulfills his criterion of humanization which is the judge of all theological constructions. The following quote seems to support this supposition. On the one hand, thus, the word "God" stands for something objectively there, a reality over against us that exists whether we are aware of it or not: we did not make ourselves; we were created by cosmic evolutionary and historical processes on which we depend absolutely for our being. On the other hand, however, the word "God" functions as a symbol within our minds, in our self-consciousness as beings who are not entirely made from without but who significantly contribute to our own creation, shaping ourselves in accordance with images and symbols to which we are devoted.79 By holding these two apparently contradictory notions in tension, Kaufman 79 Kaufman, In Face of Mystery, 320 (italics Kaufman's).</page><page sequence="22">144_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ attempts "to retain what is valid in dualistic ways of thinking, without falling into their fallacies."80 He does so by speaking only of this world, but acknowl dging that all knowledge is pervaded by ultimate mystery.81 However, even granting the coherence and consistency of this strategy, there seems to me to be other important questions not addressed by his appeal to mystery. I will close this paper with two: (1) What is humanizing about serendipitous creativity? and (2) What is divine about serendipitous creativity? In In Face of Mystery, Kaufman delineates the six small "steps of faith" to belief in the God of his construction. In the first four Kaufman leads the reader beyond the boundaries of science by portraying the "gradual emergence and development of humanity in the world as an integral part of the larger trajectory grounded in this [serendipitous] creativity of the ultimate mystery."82 According to Kaufman, these four steps lead naturally to a fifth step of faith, that is "commitment" and "trust in" the symbol "God"?the ultimate mystery which holds these evolutionary and historical processes together.83 However, to call this "step of faith" a small step is to see Mount Everest as a mere foothill. As Davis notes, "the leap from what can be con trued as a non-moral cosmic force, serendipitous creativity, to a moral mystery deserving of human commitment, is large indeed."84 Indeed, even if one grants Kaufman the move from a non-moral cosmic force to a "moral mystery," it is far from clear why such a moral mystery is deserving of human trust and commitment. In fact, one might come to the absolutely opposite conclusion. In the face of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, cosmic entropie disorder in general, and human evil, suffering and death in particular, one might reasonably conclude that if there is a "force" guiding evolution, it is to be abhorred, perhaps feared, and maybe even resisted with all the energy and 80 Ibid., 326. 81 Ibid., chs. 4-6. 82 Ibid., 288. 83 Here I am following John A. F. Davis's formulation of Kaufman's "steps of faith"in his "Hegelian and Kantian Dimensions: The Constructive Theologies of Hodgson and Kaufman,"Pacifica 9 (February 1996), 95. 84 Ibid., 95.</page><page sequence="23">_Vol 20, No. 2, May 1999_145 courage we can muster; not trusted or revered.85 However, even if the serendipitous creativity can be seen in a more positive light, I still fail to see the logic behind Kaufman's suggestion that it will lead us to "humaneness." The problem with Kaufman's argument is that he tacitly attributes a specific teleology to evolutionary processes. Why should we think that humans comprise the "proper end" of evolution, the "final note in the evolutionary opera," the "highest link on the evolutionary food-chain?" After all, it is perfectly possible, given an evolutionary understanding, that humans will comprise a very small part (perhaps, one not even deserving of a footnote) in the tome of evolutionary history, and will be replaced by a particularly well organized and adaptive strain of cockroaches. (Perhaps then, in a couple million years, a particularly bright cockroach will write a book claiming that the serendipitous creativity behind the evolutionary forces which have created the world as they know it leads to "cockroach flourishing" and thus are worthy of trust and worship.) In fact, Kaufman's attribution of humaneness to "serendipitous creativity" only makes sense when conjoined with an anthropocentric progressivist philosophy that (1) Kaufman explicitly rejects and (2) is quite out of step with contemporary evolutionary biology. Not only does Kaufman have a hard time defending the humaneness of serendipitous creativity, I cannot see how the notion implies anything that is recognizably divine. Even if we grant Kaufman's historicist, anthropological assumptions, and merely look for the divine in the "ultimate concerns" of humanity and in the "mystery which pervades all of reality," I fail to see how his view can be distinguished from unequivocally naturalistic understandings of human reality. In other words, what value is conferred by continuing to call the fortuitous processes that produced human life, "God?"86 The force of this objection, I think can be clearly shown by comparing Kaufman's thought to that of both early twentieth century and present day naturalists. For example, it is difficult to determine what exactly?in practical or functional terms ? 85 Here, perhaps, it might be said that Kaufman has not followed Kant as closely as he should. Kant's notion of "radical evil" would seem to provide a much needed corrective to Kaufman's anthropological progressivisism. 86 This is the very question asked of Henry Nelson Wieman by John Dewey (Christian Century [March 22,1933]: 395) and, more recently, by William Rowe ("Religion Within the Bounds of Naturalism: Dewey and Wieman," International Journal for Philosophy of Religion 38 [1995]: 26-31).</page><page sequence="24">146_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ separates Kaufman's constructivist, biohistorical theology from, for example, Mih?ly Csikszentmihalyi's "psycho-comic vision" and "directed evolution."87 By my lights, the single difference is that Kaufman has a place for the God concept, whereas Csikszentmihalyi does not. But as Kaufman has made abundantly clear, his continued use of God-talk is solely a function of the fact that such language continues to have organizational power for him. As such, given his epistemological standard?that of providing a "humanizing world constructing" purpose?it seems that Kaufman must accept the fact that Csikszentmihalyi has found another integrating motif. As long as "directed evolution" can serve the same function, as long as it can promote the cause of human flourishing, it seems that Kaufman could have no quarrel with Csikszentmihalyi's dispensing with God.88 Therefore, in the end, Kaufman can only be distinguished from a thorough-going naturalist not by the meaning he ascribes to the term "God," but merely by his use of the word. This is thin theological soup indeed!89 87 See his Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (New York: Harper and Row, 1990), and especially, The Evolving Self: A Psychology for the Third Millennium (New York: HarperCollins, 1993). 88 I am indebted to Paul Eddy for this line of argument. 89 This paper has benefitted from the comments of Paul Eddy, Daniel McFee, Philip Rossi, and two anonymous referees of this journal.</page></plain_text>
