Heller's vision of the horrify ing absurdity of service life in World War II is, as the constant references in the novel to its wider implications indicate, merely an illustration of the absurdity of the human condition itself. Catch-22 reflects a view of the world which is basically that of Jean Paul Sartre and the early Albert Camus. The world has no meaning but is simply there; man is a creature who seeks meaning. The relationship between man and his world is therefore absurd; human action having no intrinsic value is ultimately futile; human beings have no innate characteristics. Reason and language, man's tools for dis covering the meaning of his existence and describing his world, are useless. When a man discovers these facts about his condition he has an experience of the absurd, an experience which Sartre calls "nausea." But there are in numerable contemporary novels which are fundamentally Existentialist. What is interesting about Catch-22 is that the experimental techniques Heller</page><page sequence="2">76 Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity employs have a direct relation to Existentialist ideas; they are an attempt to "dramatize" his view of the human condition rather than merely describe it. The treatment of the soldier with convulsions which Yossarian witnesses in Rome is a heightened example of many futile actions which take place throughout the novel. A group of observers lifts the soldier from the street to the hood of a car and then, because they can think of nothing else to do, back onto the street again. The pointless repetition is characteristic of almost everyone's work in the service. Major Major, for example, is involved in signing a useless proliferation of documents. PFC. Wintergreen digs holes in Colorado and recognizes that this is not a bad assignment in wartime. "Since holes were in no great demand, he could dig them and fill them up at a leisurely pace, and he was seldom overworked."1 It is, as he points out, "a matter of duty ... and we each have our own to perform. My duty is to keep digging these holes" (p. 108). But for whom or what is one to perform this duty? The question of authority is central to the novel. God certainly no longer runs the organiza tion, though He lingers on in certain distorted images some characters still have of Him. Colonel Cathcart wishes to use Him when it is convenient, when prayers before missions, for example, might help him get his name into the Saturday Evening Post, a project which he only gives up when he discovers that the enlisted men do not have a God and a chaplain of their own and would have to be included in the prayers. Mrs. Scheisskopf is too modern a woman to believe in God, but is distraught when Yossarian suggests that God might be evil and malicious. The God she does not believe in "is a good God, a just God, a merciful God" (p. 185). To Yossarian "He's playing. Or else He's forgotten all about us" (p. 184). Even the chaplain is beginning to lose faith in the "wisdom and justice of an immortal, omnipo tent, omniscient, humane, universal, anthropomorphic, English-speaking, Anglo-Saxon, pro-American God" (p. 293). As Dunbar repeats from time to time throughout the novel, "God is dead" (pp. 129 and 130). Duty is now owed to such vague abstractions as patriotism and free enter prise, which have become exactly the tyrannous absolute values that Camus talks of in L'Homme révolté. The old man in the brothel in Rome exposes patriotism as illogical: "Surely so many countries can't all be worth dying for" (p. 253). Capitalism and free enterprise lead Milo to bomb his own unit and he excuses his action with the old slogan that what is good for money-making interests is good for the country. "Incentive" and "private industry" are "goods" and their evil results cannot change anyone's attitude towards them. Such assertive values as patriotism, then, are merely words, words which have become divorced from meaning. Heller's awareness of the separation of word and idea, which Sartre talks of, is apparent in several places in the novel. General Peckem who "laid great, fastidious stress on small matters of taste and style" (p. 328), has lost all sense of what words mean and writes his directives in a manner which combines impeccable grammar and trite adjectives. Language no longer communicates but serves to confuse things Uoseph Heller, Catch-22 (New York: 1955), p. 108.

When Yossarian makes a game of censoring letters, declaring one day "death to all modifiers," the next declaring a "war on articles" and finally blacking out everything except "a", "an", and "the", he finds that it creates "more dramatic interlinear tensions ... and in just about every case ... a message far more universal" (p. 8). Unable to obtain any sensible answer to his questions from the corporal in charge of the education session, Yos sarian declares himself "ready to pursue him through all the words in the world to wring the knowledge from him" (p. 36). In the world of the novel the authoritative values which determine the rules of behavior are man-made. But it would be false to suggest that they are the creation of any specific men, for example, of superior officers trying to trap underlings, as Yossarian so often imagines in the early part of the novel. " 'Maybe they should give him three votes,' said Yossarian. 'Who's they?' Dunbar demanded suspiciously" (p. 15). It is this indefinable "they" who organize this world, and everyone is trapped in the organization, every one is caught by Catch-22. Catch-22 is, of course, Heller's illustration of the irrational nature of the world. Any attempt to argue logically and reason ably ends in a paradox; one reaches that point where thought reaches its confines, which Camus talks of. The most frequent example of Catch-22 is the argument over the relation between being "crazy" and flying more missions. Yossarian asks whether Orr can be grounded if he is "crazy" and the doctor replies: "He has to be crazy to keep flying combat missions after all the close calls he's had. Sure, I can ground Orr. But first he has to ask me to." "That's all he has to do to be grounded?" "That's all. Let him ask me." "And then you can ground him?" Yossarian asked. "No. Then I can't ground him." "You mean there's a catch?" "Sure there's a catch," Doc Daneeka replied. "Catch 22. Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy"... Yossarian saw it clearly in all its spinning reasonableness. There was an elliptical precision about its perfect pairs of parts that was graceful and shocking, like good modern art (pp. 46 47). Further examples of Catch-22 occur over the rules for asking questions in the education session and during Yossarian's visit to PFC. Wintergreen. Catch-22 is composed of rules which apparently operate to make it im possible for a man to find a reasonable escape from them. They do not exactly contradict each other, but are continually inadequate to the occasion and always disregard the individual human life. They are intended to impose order upon chaos, but life so exceeds these rules that they only serve in the end to create more chaos. One of the clearest examples of this is the firemen who leave the blaze they are attempting to control at the hospital in order to obey the rule that they must always be on the field when the planes land. Another is the case of Doc Daneeka who is declared dead and treated as such, because his name was on the flight log of a plane that crashed, although he was never in the plane and is, as everyone knows, still alive. Since the rules do not work, anything may happen. There is no reasonable justice. Yossarian, on leave in Rome without a pass, discovers that Aarfy</page><page sequence="4">78 Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity has raped and murdered a servant girl. Yossarian expects the police to come and arrest Aarfy and in time they do arrive, only to apologize to Aarfy for interrupting him and to arrest Yossarian for being in Rome without a pass. In a world where philosophical ideas, traditional morality and reason itself are apparently useless, all man has to hold on to is his own physical body. The value which Heller supports throughout the novel is that of human existence, the individual human life. "Clevinger was dead. That was the basic flaw in his philosophy" (p. 107), and the secret which Snowden reveals to Yossarian is that "man is matter" (p. 450). Dunbar, questioned about his habit of cultivating boredom to increase his life span by making time pass more slowly, replies that, even if such a life is not very enjoyable, "what else is there?" (p. 40). There is no talk of love or even of close friendship in the book; the pleasures of life are purely physical—food, liquor, sex—just as the only real horror is physical pain and ultimately death. "In an absurd universe," writes Frederick Karl, "the individual has the right to seek survival... one's own substance is infinitely more precious than any cause."2 The view of the world in Catch-22, then, is the same view as that presented by Sartre and Camus, and the aware individual in this world comes to very much the same realizations about it as do Roquentin and Mathieu in Sartre's novels. He realizes that there is no ultimate reason for doing one thing rather than another: Captain Flume is told by Chief White Half oat that one night he is going to slit his throat. He "turned to ice; his eyes flung open wide, staring directly up into Chief White Halfoat's, glinting drunkenly only inches away. 'Why?' Captain Flume managed to croak finally. 'Why not?' was Chief White Halfoat's answer" (p. 58). The aware individual realizes, too, that there is "no way of really knowing anything" (p. 274). The chaplain sees or thinks he sees a naked man in a tree and finds it impossible to decide whether he actually saw him or whether it was an hallucination. Colonel Cathcart becomes involved in the same com plex maze of possible interpretations when he attempts to evaluate other people's attitudes to him, and at the end of the novel we learn that there are always two widely divergent official reports for every event that takes place. When everything is questionable, it is a small step to questioning one's own identity and Heller gives several illustrations of the effect of this problem on his characters. Yossarian proves with admirable logic that the second soldier in white is the first one, because all his identifiable characteristics, bandages and tubes, are the same. The colonels in the brothel in Rome find they have no identity without their uniforms: " 'We'll never be able to con vince anyone we're superior without our uniforms' " (p. 364). When he enters kindergarten, Major Major discovers he is not Caleb Major, "as he had always been led to believe, but instead was some total stranger named Major Major Major about whom he knew absolutely nothing and about whom nobody else had ever heard before" (p. 87). Names, uniforms, marks of identification are all a man has in Heller's world to assure him of his own identity. Yossarian and the chaplain, probably the two most aware characters in 2Frederick R. Karl, "Only Fools Walk in Darkness", Contemporary American Novel ists, p. 136.</page><page sequence="5">Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity 79 the novel, both have experiences of the absurd very similar to those of Roquentin in Sartre's La Nausée. The chaplain experiences "terrifying, sudden moments when objects, concepts and even people that the chaplain had lived with all his life inexplicably took on an unfamiliar and irregular aspect that he had never seen before and made them seem totally strange" (pp. 209-210). Yossarian's experiences also have the effect of alienating him from his environment, but are less concerned with the strangeness of objects than with their profusion and gratuitousness. The first takes place when he is walking in the woods : Along the ground suddenly, on both sides of the path, he saw dozens of new mushrooms the rain had spawned poking their nodular fingers up through the clammy earth like lifeless stalks of flesh, sprouting in such necrotic profusion everywhere he looked that they seemed to be pro liferating right before his eyes. There were thousands of them swarming as far back into the underbrush as he could see, and they appeared to swell in size and multiply in number as he spied them (p. 147). In spite of all the aspects of this passage which link it to the specific situation of Catch-22—the suggestion of Yossarian's numerous dead friends, for example, and the rapid increase in their numbers—it would not be out of place in La Nausée. Yossarian's second experience of the absurd is caused by a burst of flak hitting his plane: Wind whistling up through the jagged gash in the floor kept the myriad bits of paper circulating like alabaster particles in a paperweight and contributed to a sensation of lacquered, waterlogged unreality. Every thing seemed strange, so tawdry and grotesque (p. 154). Heller, like Sartre and Camus, is not however totally pessimistic. Valid action is possible for the individual; there is even the suggestion of a sane universe which Sweden may represent. The hope of Sweden is perhaps a false note in the novel, but it is important to remember that it is only a possibility, a state of mind rather than a real place. Although Orr has, at least reportedly, reached Sweden, ironically by pretending to be "crazy," Yossarian at the end of the novel does not really expect to get further than Rome. In a discussion of the techniques which Heller has employed to convey his view of the world it would be easy to ignore the obvious. Catch-22 is a very funny book. It would be easy to ignore this because, in spite of the laughter it evokes, the overall impression is as much of horror as of humor. The laughter evoked is not of the kind that unites us warmly in sympathy with the human race as we enjoy its foibles, but rather that which serves to alienate us by exposing the bitter ironies of existence. Nevertheless I believe that humor is a way of understanding the techniques of the novel. Laughter, as Bergson suggests, is caused by incongruity, by a frustrating of our expectations of a certain result, and it is a failure to fulfill certain of the reader's expectations which is the link underlying the so-called absurd techniques of the novel. What is the basis of these expectations? When we discover that Milo has become mayor or civic leader of almost every town in Europe and North</page><page sequence="6">80 Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity Africa, we are amused because that is impossible. We do not expect that to happen to anyone in life. It is not life-like, not realistic. But when the reader is confronted with the juxtaposition in one sentence of references to several unrelated events about which he so far knows nothing, we cannot say that it is not like life. Actually it is; we often overhear conversations which are meaningless to us because we do not understand to whom or to what they refer. Yet we are surprised to find it in a novel. In this instance, obviously, it is our expectations about the nature of the novel, not about life, which are not being fulfilled. This is, I think, the key to defining the absurd techniques. In some way each of them plays against and frustrates the reader's expec tations of a novel, the illusions, one could say, that he has about the nature of the novel. In an essay called "Sur quelques notions périmées" Robbe-Grillet has pointed out the extent to which the modern reader's view of the novel is still based upon a definition of the realistic nineteenth century novel in spite of experiments in form by writers like Joyce and Kafka. He feels that this view is perpetuated by critical terminology; that we are so accustomed to dis cussions of "character", "atmosphere", "form" and "narrative ability", that we fail to recognize that it represents an idea about the novel and not the "nature" of the novel.3 He believes that a novel is for most readers a story and that the judgment made on the book will consist chiefly of an appreciation of its plot, its gradual development, its equilibrium.4 It is obvious that the narrative technique of Catch-22 does not fulfill the expectation of the reader for a continuous line of action in which one episode is related to the next, at the very least chronologically, and in which events are life-size and probable. Situations which are initially familiar enough to the reader may be gradually exaggerated to the point of absurdity. Oil was always discovered wherever Chief White Halfoat's family pitched their tents, Halfoat explains, and the oil companies began sending out representatives to follow the family. Suddenly the whole action becomes incredible: "Soon whole drilling crews were following us around with all their equipment just to get the jump on each other. Companies began to merge just so that they could cut down on the number of people they had to assign to us. But the crowd in back of us kept growing. We never got a good night's sleep. When we stopped, they stopped. When we moved, they moved... They began to follow us around from in front. They would try to guess where we were going to stop next and would begin drilling before we even got there, so we couldn't even stop. As soon as we'd begin to unroll our blankets, they would kick us off' (p. 45). Captain Black's "Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade" gets out of hand in a similar way when he makes everyone sign "two loyalty oaths, then three, then four" and introduces "the pledge of allegiance and after that 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' one chorus, two choruses, three choruses, four choruses" (p. 117), as do Dobb's plans to murder Colonel Cathcart which end in his planning to 3Alain Robbe-Grillet, For A New Novel, trans. Richard Howard (New York: 1965), p. 25. *Ibid., p. 31.</page><page sequence="7">Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity 81 murder almost everyone. Many of the descriptions of exaggerated action concern Milo, whose activities become increasingly complex as the novel progresses. The futility of all human action is suggested by Heller in the number of times events or conversations are repeated so that the reader, like Yossarian, eventually has the feeling that he has "been through this exact conversation before" (p. 455). The dialogue which concludes with the realization that "crazy" men can be grounded, but only "crazy" men will fly occurs numerous times, as does the pattern of Yossarian's conversations with the chaplain in which comments are punctuated continually by the phrases " 'that's bad' " or " 'that's good' " (p. 12). Colonel Cathcart's comment to Major Major when he tells him that he is the new squadron commander is similarly re peated. There are two trial scenes in the novel, one concerning Clevinger and the other the chaplain, and each follows the same pattern and comes to the same conclusion: "Clevinger was guilty, of course, or he would not have been accused, and since the only way to prove it was to find him guilty, it was their patriotic duty to do so" (p. 82). The same sense of the futility of human endeavor is conveyed by circular actions like the episode of Hungry Joe and Huple's cat. Hungry Joe dreams that Huple's cat is sleeping on his face, suffocating him, and when he wakes up Huple's cat is sleeping on his face. Yossarian organizes a fight between Joe and the cat, but the cat flees and Joe is declared the winner, goes to bed victorious and dreams that Huple's cat is sleeping on his face, suffocating him. The narrative technique serves to confuse the reader about time and to destroy any certainty he may have about what has taken place, thus creating in him the same doubts about reality that Yossarian experiences and that Sartre and Camus speak of. Heller employs three basic methods of disrupting the expected chronological flow of the action. The first is a simple one. He often makes a statement about an event which has taken place and deliber ately omits the clarification which the statement requires. Therefore many of the major events in the novel are referred to two or three times, sometimes in increasing detail, before the full account is given. There are two references to Milo's bombing his own squadron before we are given the details; two to his ability to buy eggs at seven cents and sell them at a profit at five cents. The first reference to Snowden comes in the question Yossarian asks in the education session and we learn simply that he was killed over Avignon. Half of the scene in which Snowden dies is described some twenty pages later, and it is almost two hundred pages before that scene is picked up again and continued until Yossarian sees Snowden. In the next reference we learn that Yossarian treated Snowden for the wrong wound and then finally, almost at the end of the novel, we are given the whole account. Occasionally the initial statement may be about an apparently impossible event, like the casual reference to the "dead man in Yossarian's tent" who "was simply not easy to live with" (p. 22). It is a hundred pages before we discover that this really refers to the possessions of a man who has been killed in action. The second device creates confusion in the mind of the reader by present ing him with two apparently contradictory statements about the same event before providing a clarification. For example, Doc Daneeka tells Yossarian that he was drafted just when his business was beginning to show a profit</page><page sequence="8">82 Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity and later says "fortunately just when things were blackest the war broke out" (p. 41). Finally the explanation is given: "Fifty grand a year I was knocking down ... And look what happened. Just when I was all set to really start stashing it away, they had to manufacture fascism and start a war horrible enough to affect even me" (p. 52). The war initially improved his business, but being drafted prevented his profiting from it. A similar effect is created by the apparently absurd coincidence of Major Major and Yossarian inde pendently signing Washington Irving's name to official papers, until it is re vealed that Major Major obtained the idea by hearing about Yossarian's activities from a C.I.D. man. The third method is an extension of the second: contradictory accounts are given of an event and no solution is provided. The reader is left uncertain of the truth and in some instances asked to believe the incredible. The C.I.D. man is supposed to have caught a cold from the fighter captain who, we are told, did not have a cold; Milo claims that he did not direct the anti-aircraft fire upon his own planes, then that he did. Chief White Halfoat's incredible story about his family being moved every time oil is discovered is called a lie by Yossarian, but Halfoat is transferred to Pianosa from Colorado at the first mention of oil. As well as confusing the reader about the time or exact nature of the events in the novel, Heller also frequently shocks him by adopting attitudes to objects or situations opposite to the expected ones. By introducing these unexpected attitudes in a very casual way, he not only challenges the tra ditional value system but suggests through his tone that nothing unusual is being said, thus doubling the shock effect. Nately, we are told, "had a bad start. He came from a good family" (p. 13), and "did not hate his mother and father, even though they had been very good to him" (p. 255). Yossarian is sorry to hear that he and the chaplain have a mutual friend, because "it seemed there was a basis to their conversation after all" (p. 12). The Texan is "good-natured, generous and likable. In three days no-one could stand him" (p. 10). The disparity between tone and subject matter is exploited by Heller most successfully in his treatment of horrific situations, particularly those involving death or human suffering. Lieutenant Scheisskopf, anxious to have his men march in perfect formation in parades, wishes to nail "the twelve men in each rank to a long two-by-four beam of seasoned oak to keep them in line", but: The plan was not feasible, for making a ninety-degree turn would have been impossible without nickel-alloy swivels inserted in the small of every man's back, and Lieutenant Scheisskopf was not sanguine at all about obtaining that many nickel-alloy swivels from Quartermaster or enlisting the co-operation of the surgeons at the hospital (p. 75). Heller's methods of characterization, like his narrative techniques and his use of tone, depend upon a frustration of the reader's expectations. Robbe Grillet claims that the idea that the novelist has to create characters is another obsolete notion. He explains that according to the traditional view a character has to have a proper name, parents, heredity, profession and a personality</page><page sequence="9">Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity 83 which permits the reader to judge him, love him or hate him.6 None of the great contemporary novels, Robbe-Grillet claims, corresponds to the norm of criticism on the question of character. Beckett, he points out, changes his hero's name and shape in the course of the same narrative; K of Kafka's The Castle is content with an initial, has no possessions, family or face, and probably is not even a land-surveyor.6 There are two possible ways, then, of failing to fulfill a reader's expecta tions about character in a novel: one is to change the character's identity, provide multiple personalities for the same name, or one name for various figures, and thus disturb the reader's whole conception of identity, as do John Barth and Samuel Beckett; the other is to provide caricatures, figures who are no more than puppets and in whom the reader is not expected to believe. Heller occasionally appears to experiment with the first method, as, for example, in the scene where Yossarian pretends to be a dying officer whose parents fail to recognize him, or where Yossarian and Dunbar discover they can change identities by changing hospital beds. But although in these scenes the characters experience doubts about their identities, the reader is always quite clear about the identity of the character and no real confusion is created. Most of the characters in Catch-22 are, however, caricatures, cardboard figures who are distinguished for the reader by their particular obsessions. Each lives with an illusory view of the world which isolates him and makes the results of his actions very different from his expectations. Each is, in his way, the unaware individual who, as Camus illustrates in Le Mythe de Sisyphe, believes that he can operate in the world as he imagines it and that his actions will achieve their purpose. So Hungry Joe devotes his life to taking pictures which never come out, Scheisskopf to conducting parades, Major Major to avoiding everyone. General Peckem, continually writing memoranda recommending that his Special Services Division be placed in control over the combat forces, finds that by the time he has succeeded he has been "promoted" to head of combat forces and someone else is now his superior. Colonel Cathcart, anxious for promotion to General, institutes a variety of plans to make himself popular with his superiors, but each of them leaves him less popular than before. Most of these characters are introduced to us in deceptively explanatory paragraphs which appear to sum up their personalities in a few adjectives, but which really provide the reader with irreconcilably opposite traits. Colonel Cathcart, for example, was a "slick, successful, slipshod, unhappy man of thirty-six who lumbered when he walked and wanted to be a general. He was dashing and dejected, poised and chagrined" (p. 191). Gradually the characters become increasingly absurd as the personality traits of each are seen to be one, an obsession. It is believable that one of Milo's moral principles was that "it was never a sin to charge as much as the traffic could bear" (p. 66), but by the time his activities have taken over Europe and North Africa in one vast syndicate and he has bombed his own men, he has become little more than a personification of greed. Scheisskopfs enjoyment of parades may be initially credible but his childish delight in calling off 5Robbe-Grillet, p. 32. «Ibid., p. 28.</page><page sequence="10">84 Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity parades that have never been scheduled is not. These characters may have names, parents, heredity, professions and faces, but we cannot very long sustain the illusion that they are "real" human beings. The most important device a novelist has to suggest an irrational world is, of course, the treatment of reason itself. Reasoning, in Catch-22, invariably ends up in some variation of Catch-22; apparent logic is used to destroy sense. The reader is led into following an argument which progresses logically, but which arrives at an absurd conclusion. Clevinger is on trial for attempt ing to disrupt Scheisskopf's parade: "In sixty days you'll be fighting Billy Petrolle," the colonel with the big fat mustache roared. "And you think it's a big fat joke." "I don't think it's a joke, sir," Clevinger replied. "Don't interrupt." "Yes, sir." "And say, 'sir', when you do," ordered Major Metcalfe. "Yes, sir." "Weren't you just ordered not to interrupt?" Major Metcalf inquired coldly. "But I didn't interrupt, sir," Clevinger protested. "No. And you didn't say 'sir' either. Add that to the charges against him," Major Metcalf directed the corporal who could take shorthand. "Failure to say 'sir' to superior officers when not interrupting them (p. 77). A similar conversation takes place between Yossarian and Luciana, who will not marry Yossarian because he is "crazy" and knows he is "crazy" because he wants to marry her. Individual sentences in the novel may appear to be absurd when they are in fact completely logical: "I didn't know there were any other Captain Yossarians. As far as I know, I'm the only Captain Yossarian I know, but that's only as far as I know" (p. 13). In other instances the structure and tone of sentences suggest meaning where in fact there is none: "He had decided to live for ever or die in the attempt" (p. 30). " 'You're American officers. The officers of no other army in the world can make that statement. Think about it," (p. 28), says Colonel Cargill to his men. Sentence structure is used throughout Catch-22 to add to the reader's con fusion about characters and events and contributes to the impression of an irrational world. The novel is full of complex sentences in which the individual clauses and phrases are not related to each other or are related at a tangent: "McWatt wore fleecy bedroom slippers with his red pajamas and slept between freshly pressed colored bed-sheets like the one Milo had retrieved half of for him from the grinning thief with the sweet tooth in exchange for none of the pitted dates Milo had borrowed from Yossarian" (p. 61). As the sentence progresses each new clause or phrase does not clarify what has gone before but adds new complications: "Immediately next door to Yossarian was Havermeyer, who liked peanut brittle and lived all by himself in the two man tent in which he shot tiny field mice every night with huge bullets from the .45 he had stolen from the dead man in Yossarian's tent" (p. 18). A statement is often qualified by a negative clause which gives the ap</page><page sequence="11">Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity 85 pearance of clarifying but, of course, adds nothing. For example, Nately "had gone every free day to work on the officer's club that Yossarian had not helped to build" (p. 18), and "on the other side of Havermeyer stood the tent McWatt no longer shared with Clevinger, who had still not returned when Yossarian came out of the hospital" (p. 18). Heller's favorite stylistic device is the use of double or triple negatives in one sentence. This gives that effect of language constantly trying, but always just failing, to describe or define, which the reader is aware of throughout the novel. "And if that wasn't funny," we are told, "there were lots of things that weren't even funnier" (p. 17). "But Yossarian couldn't be happy, even though the Texan didn't want him to be" (p. 16). And Major Major's father has learned that "the more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce" (p. 85). Frederick Karl describes Yossarian as "the man who acts in good faith to use Sartre's often-repeated phrase," and claims that all Yossarian "can hope to know is that he is superior to any universal force (man-made or otherwise), and all he can hope to recognize is that the universal or collective force can never comprehend the individual."7 He goes on to call Yossarian's final decision "a moral act of responsibility," "reflective, conscious and indeed free," while the other characters are not free, he considers, because they are unaware.8 This is all true; it is obvious that Yossarian is a man of whom Sartre would approve, but it does not go far enough. Certainly awareness is a prerequisite to the right action as Heller sees it. It is proved useless to be simply good like the chaplain or merely innocent like Nately, unable to detach himself from his father's values. And certainly Yossarian acts in freedom, but in the name of what? I do not think that it is only in the name of his own individual life, although this is his starting point. What most critics have overlooked is that Yossarian changes, is the one character who learns from his experience in the novel. At the beginning of Catch-22 Yossarian attempts to exercise his reason to escape from the situation he is in. "Everywhere he looked was a nut, and it was all a sensible young gentleman like himself could do to maintain his perspective against so much madness" (p. 21). He soon learns, however, that everyone considers everyone else "a nut" and that when he attempts to argue logically against flying more missions he comes up against Catch-22. He realizes that to use reason in the face of the irrational is futile and that the way out of Catch-22 is simply to rebel, in Camus' sense, to take a stand, to say "no." He refuses to fly any more missions. This is, of course, the way the problems of Catch-22 have been solved earlier in the novel: the young officers solve the problem of the "dead man" in Yossarian's tent simply by throwing out his possessions; Major de Coverley solves the "great loyalty oath" Catch, which is preventing the men from getting their meals, simply by saying " 'Give everybody eat' " (p. 120). Until the final episode in the book, Yossarian is the great supporter of individual right. He explains to Clevinger that someone is trying to kill him 'Karl, p. 137. »Ibid., pp. 137-138.</page><page sequence="12">86 Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity and answers Clevinger's explanation that they are shooting at everyone with " 'What difference does that make?' " (p. 17). When he complains that someone is trying to poison him, the conversation follows the same pattern. "That men would die was a matter of necessity; which men would die, though, was a matter of circumstance and Yossarian was willing to be a victim of anything but circumstance" (p. 69). Yossarian indeed realizes, as Karl suggests, "that one must not be asked to give his life unless everybody is willing to give his,"9 but by the end of the novel he has come to realize the logical extension of this concept, that, if what is true for one must be applied to all, then one cannot attempt to save one's own life at the expense of others. One cannot give tacit acceptance to other people's deaths, without giving everyone the same right over oneself. This is surely the significance of the episode in which Nately's whore tries to stab Yossarian and its relevance to his change of mind. Yossarian is given the chance to save his own life if he lies about Colonels Cathcart and Korn to their superior officers. He will, in accepting the offer, probably act as an incentive to his fellow officers to fly more missions in which many of them may be killed. He is given a chance, in Camus' terms, to join forces with the pestilences. After accepting the offer he is stabbed by Nately's whore and realizes perhaps that by joining those who are willing to kill, he has given everyone the right to kill him. If one rebels, one must rebel in the name of a value which transcends oneself, human life is the value for which Yossarian rebels and runs off to Rome, but it is not merely his own individual existence. This point is stressed by Heller in Yossarian's declaration that he is going to try and save the kid sister of Nately's whore, is going to perform an unselfish act. If we look back at the novel in the light of what Yossarian's decision reveals, we can see that Heller has presented us with a series of character studies of selfish men and has shown how their actions for their own gain have involved death for others. They are all like Major Major's father, "a long limbed farmer, a God-fearing, freedom-loving, rugged individualist who held that federal aid to anyone but farmers was creeping socialism" (p. 85). Milo, another "rugged individualist," bombs his own men; Colonel Cathcart, aiming at impressing the Generals to obtain promotion, keeps raising the number of missions his men must fly. To claim as Karl does, that these characters "are not really evil in any sinister way" but just "men on the make"10 is inaccurate. The "man on the make" is evil to Heller, since he gains at the expense of others and asks them to do what he is not willing to do himself. The last ten pages or so of the novel may be sentimentally handled, as critics have suggested, but they present the key to a full understanding of what Heller is saying. In an irrational and gratuitous world the aware indi vidual has to rebel, but his rebellion must be a free act and in the name of a value which can be applied to all men and does not limit their freedom. The style of Catch-22, like the narrative technique, the tone and the methods of characterization, serves to frustrate the reader's expectations. Each of the techniques I have discussed depends for its effect upon a pre conception of the reader that a novel tells a story, is peopled with recognizably »Karl, p. 136. 10Karl, p. 137.</page><page sequence="13">Joseph Heller: At War With Absurdity 87 human beings and is written in a style which justifies Ian Watt's claim that "the function of language is much more largely referential in the novel than in other literary forms."11 In spite of the nineteenth century novelist's frequent side comments to his audience and in spite of early twentieth century experi ments in form, Watt is surely correct when he says: "Formal realism, in fact, is the narrative embodiment of a premise... which is implicit in the novel form in general: the premise, or primary convention, that the novel is a full and authentic report of human experience."12 The reader expects to be drawn into the world of a novel, then, but Catch-22, while initially providing him with familiar human situations, ends by rejecting him. The novel itself be comes an object which provides the reader with the experience of the absurd, just as the trees provide it for Roquentin in Sartre's La Nausée. After attempting to relate his preconceptions about novels, his "illusions" about the form, to this novel, the reader is finally stripped of them. Catch-22 simul taneously shows man's illusory view of the world, employs techniques to suggest the irrational nature of the world and is itself an object against which the truth of its statements may be tested.
