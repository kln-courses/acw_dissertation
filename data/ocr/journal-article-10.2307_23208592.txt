<plain_text><page sequence="1">CROSS-CULTURAL EXPERIENCES THROUGH AN EXHIBITION IN CHINA AND SWITZERLAND: THE ART OF PAPER-CUTTING: EAST MEETS WEST Crystal Hui-Shu Yang In 2007, the Ernst Hohl-Culture Foundation initiated a cultural-exchange program be tween China and Switzerland based on the concept of "East Meets West" through the art of paper-cutting. The following year, the foundation invited to Switzerland four pa per-cutting artists from different parts of China. Following visits to Appenzellerland and Toggenburg to observe Swiss folklife, Chinese artists Hua Yuexiu, Wang Hongchuan, Huang Ying, and Xu Yang faced the challenge of synthesizing aspects of the East and West into their art. Works produced subsequent to this trip were showcased in an exhibition, The Art of Paper-Cutting: East Meets West, which was held between 2009 and 2010 in Zurich, Switzerland, as well as in Beijing and Hangzhou, China.1 The art of paper-cutting originated in China, following the invention of paper in the second century c.E., but cutting on thin surfaces of various other materials (such as silk, gold and silver foil, tree bark, and hide) had developed earlier. The oldest extant pa per-cuts were excavated in a South-North dynasties tomb from the sixth century c.E. at Gaochang in Xingjiang. During the Tang dynasty (618-907 c.E.), paper-cutting flour ished with the increasing availability of high quality paper. As the material became more affordable, paper-cutting became deeply rooted in folk culture and developed into one of the most widely spread art forms in China. While Chinese calligraphy reflects the in tellectual culture, paternal tradition, and writ ten history, paper-cutting represents the il literate culture, maternal tradition, and oral history. Styles and designs of paper-cutting vary regionally. Red paper is used most of ten, but painted cuttings or cut layers of col ored-paper collage are also produced in some areas. In agricultural China, mothers and grandmothers teach young girls to make paper-cuts, along with dough figures, em broideries, ornaments, and clothing. During New Year celebrations, village women dec orate the inside and outside of their houses with paper-cuttings. Aside from their use on the occasions of childbirth, festivals, wed dings, and funerals, paper-cuttings are some times associated with sorcery, healing, and exorcism. In addition, they serve as stencils for embroidery. Stylized designs of animals and plants often convey symbolic or metaphorical meanings. Fertility is the most recurring theme. Like the endless flow of the Yellow River, this ancient folk art has been passed down over many generations, preserving primeval totems, customs, and traditions. For the artists traveling to Switzerland, detaching the paper-cut from its Chinese cultural context to interpret unfamiliar sub jects seemed novel. For example, when learning he was selected to be among the Chinese paper-cutters traveling to Switzer land, Xu described his first reaction as a mixed feeling of being excited, honored, and lost. He felt uncertainty about how to draw</page><page sequence="2">30 Fig. 1 Hua Yuexiu, Alpfahrt (Cattle Drive to the Alpine Pastures). 2008. Paper-cut, 68 x 50 cm. Owned by the artist.

A native to Jingbian, Shaanxi, Hua inherited the San bian paper-cutting practice. Sanbian repre sents three regions—Jingbian, Anbian, and Dingbian—located in northern Shaanxi Province. Sanbian paper-cuts are known for their exquisite, gentle style, which is char acteristic of the southern school (albeit San bian is located in northern China) in contrast to the robust and weighty spirit of the north ern school. Many of Hua's works depict festive scenes and folk customs on a very large scale and in great detail. For example, Sanbian Wedding Customs measures 90 by 750 cen timeters. While traditional Chinese long scroll paintings expand horizontally and scenes go on like film footage without frames, in Hua's monochrome paper-cuts, temporal and spatial relationships are or chestrated in allover compositions in which figural narrative can be found everywhere and objects are positioned without overlap ping each other. Viewers may visually zoom in for a specific setting or zoom out for an overview. At first glance, Hua s Alpfahrt (Cattle Drive to the Alpine Pastures) (Fig. 1) re sembles a typical Chinese paper-cutting. Taking a closer look, one notices its Swiss theme. Three segments of curvilinear lines are visually threaded by a herd of cattle to compose a rhythmic melody. Hua's trek—a continuous narrative—seems to depart from home, travel en route, and arrive at the des tination simultaneously. The annual alpine journey begins at the mountain's foot and crescendos to the summit. Throughout the scene, trees and plants sprout, and birds chirp in the air of late spring. Cows, in an ascend ing procession, are accompanied by the mu sic of cowbells and the yodeling of herds men, who move up rolling hills to the alpine pastures. In the upper right-hand corner of the work, earlier arrivals greet a newcomer in a house, where they traditionally stay until their return home in late summer. Outside an annexed cowshed, there are three cows and a calf. The procession is led by a Swiss-costumed boy shouldering a cheese bottle, followed by belled goats that are shepherded by an other boy and girl. Next in the pageant are three cows wearing bells and three herds men. At the center right, there is a two-story farmhouse in which two children study up stairs. Downstairs, a peasant woman em broiders, while a boy plays with a cat and a dog as two butterflies flutter about his shoul ders. In the field, a farmer rakes, and another reaps. At the bottom, the host farmer bids farewell to his family. Next to him is a horse dragging a carrier containing cheese and but ter makers, followed by a barking Appenzell mountain dog. The slim and refined lines, which are often seen in Hua's works, connect all forms on a single sheet of paper. For viewers, there are endless hidden details to discover with every glance at her work. Growing up in a peasant family, Hua reveals her observant insights into country life. Hua's portrayal presents the viewer with every detail of a uniquely Swiss folk subject, carefully observed by the artist through a conventional Chinese form. In contrast to Hua s multiple-perspective narrative, Wang translates the same theme, Alpfahrt, into a more simplified image. In her horizontally orientated paper-cut, several wavy slits laid on solid red paper create a view of the hilly terrain in which circuitous rows of animals and people steadily advance</page><page sequence="4">32 Fig. 2 Wang Hongchuan, Viehschau (Cattle Show). 2008. 70 x 100 cm.

Currently a professor in the Art De partment, Baotou Teachers College at the Inner Mongolia University of Science &amp; Technology, Wang has more connections with the academic art world than the other three paper-cutting artists. Wang had an earlier "East meets West" experience when she did graduate work un der Qiao Xiaoguang, professor and director of the Intangible Cultural Heritage Research Center at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Wang has written about one of Qiao's international projects celebrating the 200th birthday of the Norwegian playwright Hennk Ibsen, which took place during the Beijing International Dance Season of 2006.3 In collaboration with the choreographer and the stage designer of the Ibsen Theatre of Norway, Qiao applied Chinese paper-cutting to stage design for a modern dance drama, Hunting Nora (adapted from Ibsen's play A Doll s House). As a backdrop for the performance, Qiao created twenty-seven large-scale paper-cut tings in an intense and saturated Chinese red color that were affixed to clear window like surfaces. Interestingly, the Chinese word jianzhi ("paper-cut") is also referred to as chuanghua ("window flower"). As the latter word suggests, paper-cuts are often used to</page><page sequence="5">33 Fig. 3 Xu Yang, Silvesterklausen (New Year's Eve Klaus). 2008. 135 x 67 cm. Ernst Hohl Culture Foundation. (Photo: the artist) decorate windows. Usually glued down on the exterior side of windows, the negative spaces of the cutout allow light to shine through. With various folding methods, pa per-cutting can produce symmetrical, repet itive, and consecutive designs. Combining small paper-cuts on latticed windows of a traditional Chinese building can generate a kaleidoscopic feast. Mounted on transparent panes like "win dow flowers," Qiao reversed nearly identical dragon forms to create mirror images. Three pairs of face-to-face dragons were arranged to partially surround a large central stage panel, which Qiao visualized as "the outer wall of the home" as well as symbols of male power and patriarchal society. Toward the end of the play, Qiao made use of but terfly motifs, split into seven paper-cut pan els that gradually descended from the rafters down to the stage. The leading character of the performance, Nora, "liberates" herself by dancing throughout the paper-cut images and creating a dazzling perceptual fantasy. This innovative experiment in set design led Qiao to further expand his approach in syn thesizing East and West in a series of paper cuts based on the Finnish epic Kalevala for his 2008 solo show in Kuhmo, Finland. The abstraction and repetition developed in Qiao's cross-cultural works significantly influenced his student, Wang, who has taken advantage of the facsimile nature of paper cutting to experiment with different possi bilities. For instance, in her two-color pa per-cut Viehschau (Cattle Show) (Fig. 2), Wang playfully flip-flopped cutouts of five vertical rows of cattle icons and systemati cally rearranged and counterposed their pos itive and negative patterns. Among ten blue and black rows, mirror images of paired an imals face each other except for one solid cow figure in each pair of alternating vertical columns. Through this design, Wang con veys her impression of Switzerland as an orderly country, where even the cattle market is well organized.4 Wang also experimented with the technique of creating mirror images in combination with ping se jianzhi ("mixed color collage")5 in other paper-cuts made</page><page sequence="6">34 for the 2009-2010 exhibition venues in Switzerland and China. Another Chinese artist to visit Switzerland, Xu, fused Swiss subject matter and the ab stract-figural approach of the northern school of Chinese paper-cutting to create a fasci nating piece called Silvesterklausen (New Year's Eve Klaus) (Fig. 3). Currently a resi dent of Beijing, Xu has received a govern ment subsidy as an artist. His works convey forceful momentum and an imposing appear ance often seen in the paper-cuts of northern China. Silvesterklausen (or Klausen) are as sociated with New Year's mummer proces sions, which include groups of men dressed in traditional costumes. According to the cur rent Gregorian calendar and the old Julian calendar, the celebration of New Year's Eve in Appenzellerland takes place on both De cember 31 and January 13 (or on December 30 and January 12, if the normal dates fall on a Sunday). On the day of New Year's Eve, the Silvesterklausen walk from door to door to yodel and to deliver blessings. There are three types of Silvesterklausen: the beau tiful, the ugly, and the beautiful-ugly. The beautiful Klausen wear masks with eye catching outfits and headwear. The beauti ful-ugly Klausen wear costumes made of nat ural materials (such as hollies, fir twigs, moss, and pinecones) and headdresses that are not as lavish as those of the beautiful Klausen. The ugly Klausen dress like the beautiful ugly Klausen, but wear fearsome masks. Xu became acquainted with the tradition of Silvesterklausen by visiting a folklore museum during his trip to Switzerland. Xu said that he was emotionally stirred by the images of the various Klausen. In his pa per-cut, however, Xu does not attempt to emulate the appearance of any particular type of Silvesterklausen,6 He imaginatively transforms the clumsily moving masked man into a mysterious creature. The central black figure is adorned with two bells and carries a walking cane. His form is offset by a yel low paper layer of slightly larger size, giving the horned and tusked anthropomorphic creature an uncanny glow. The head of a bull is displayed on its abdominal area and is reminiscent of the "furious beast" emblem seen on warrior costumes in Chinese opera. The head of the Klaus is duplicated twice— once in red, once in black—the two heads (one the reverse of the other) being partially overlapped by the main figure, creating the illusion of a procession moving through the space of the composition. The distribution of red flowers around the masked man's legs further enhances the illusion of depth and draws attention to the movement of his lower limbs. By comparison, the same subject depicted by Huang appears less imaginative. Huang, from Sichuan Province, had once been Xu's student. (The influence of printmaking can sometimes be seen in both Xu's and Huang's paper-cutting.) In Huang's piece, the Klaus is assembled with identically shaped leaf forms of different colors into the shape of a static, bulging, inelegant figure on a white background. Of the four arists, Huang was least successful in her attempt to integrate the two cultures. In 2009, Chinese paper-cutting was added to the UNESCO Representative List of In tangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. This action has prompted the recent safeguarding of this ancient folk tradition in China, which had long been disregarded as insignificant "women's work." For over a thousand years, uneducated peasant women have been mak ing paper-cutouts as part of their leisure activity. Designs were imitated, shared, and passed down from one generation to the next for centuries. In the past, the creators of</page><page sequence="7">35 paper-cuttmgs remained anonymous. Nowa days, however, more and more members of the cultural and intellectual elite have joined the ranks of those creating these works of art, thus raising their value and importance. Paper-cutting is currently included in chil dren's schooling as well as in art programs at universities and academies in China. In today's environment of rapidly advancing globalization and social transformation, Chi nese paper-cuttings are being produced out side of their original cultural context, and paper-cuttmg artists are facing a dilemma wherein they must balance tradition with modernization and globalization. Through the cross-cultural exhibition The Art of Pa per-Cutting: East Meets West, four artists endeavored to synthesize Chinese and Eu ropean traditions as they—in concert with many of their Chinese contemporaries—con tinually strive to rejuvenate and prolong their cultural heritage and assure its presence and appreciation on the global stage. NOTES 1. The exhibition The Art of Paper-Cutting: East Meets West was held at the Haus Appenzell in Zurich from 2 Oct. 2009 to 30 Jan. 2010. In addition to dis playing paper-cuts by Hua Yuexiu, Wang Hongchuan, Huang Ying, and Xu Yang, the show also included works by other Chinese paper-cutting artists who did not visit Switzerland, but created works based on their inspection of images, videos, and other information related to Switzerland. The paper-cuts were presented under themes related to Appenzellerland (such as Sil vesterklausen, Alpfahrt, Alpstobete, Bloch, Viehschau, Innerrhoder Landsgemeinde in Appenzell, Fronleich nam, and cheese making). In conjunction with the cel ebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the establish ment of diplomatic relations between China and Switzerland, the exhibition was also held at the Tsinghua University in Beijing (27 Mar.-5 Apr. 2010) and traveled south to the China Academy of Art in Hangzhou (12-20 Apr. 2010). Eight Swiss scheren schnitte artists (Elisabeth Bottesi-Fischer, Monika Flutsch-Gloor, Ueli Hofer, Elsi Hohl-Lauchenauer, Ernst Oppliger, Susanne Schlupfer, Bruno Weber, and Sonja Ziiblin) joined the original four Chinese paper cutting artists at the exhibition in China. 2.

It involves stapling the four corners of a stack of different colored papers, cutting the design on the stacked papers to make replicas, and structurally dissecting each colored design into several segments. Then, different colored segments are mixed to recon struct the whole design, resulting in copies of the same designs with a variety of color combinations. 6. Xu, 55-56.</page></plain_text>
