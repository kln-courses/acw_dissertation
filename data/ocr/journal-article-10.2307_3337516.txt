<plain_text><page sequence="1">Elephant Women, Furious and Majestic Women's Masquerades in Africa and the Diaspora SIDNEY LITTLEFIELD KASFIR Women, Masks and Theory n this overview of women's masking in parts of Africa and the Caribbean I attempt, first, to situate women's rela- tions to masks and mask performance within the changing historical dis- course on African masking and, sec- ond, to identify and discuss a few of the issues that appear to crosscut the other- wise widely different (and, some will say, incommensurate) examples described by the contributors to this issue of African Arts. These aims carry the dual risk of both vapid theorizing at a stratospheric level and, on the ground, trying to fit square pegs into round holes. Conversely, given real similarities, one hopes to avoid the reductionist temptation to "grind the data down to the lowest common denom- inator" (Argenti 1997:363). Here and there I will use my own fieldwork among the Idoma and Samburu to amplify the exam- ples in this issue. I use the terms "masking" and "mas- querade" interchangeably here to describe a performance and a practice (described in Nigerian pidgin as "plays" and "play- ing") in which illusion is created through the use of some combination of facial disguise, costume, body decoration, props, movement, vocalization, drum- ming, or other means. But equally impor- tant, masquerade in Africa also presumes a structure of belief which typically associates this illusion with the em- bodiment of a spirit or, in certain places, the appearance of reincarnated ancestors. Because of this belief (which is acted upon through the dialectic of structure and practice), most African masquerades signify something besides the basic visu- al and performative fact of a person in a costume playing before an audience. This power of masquerades to signify, paired with their calendrical occurrence, causes 18 scholars to incorporate them into the wider set of behaviors usually studied as ritual performance. African Diaspora masquerades in the Caribbean islands and the American South which have been associated with season- al festivals developed out of a different social milieu and do not partake of the same belief structure. They are often spec- tacles owing as much to Hollywood movies and (in the past) Shakespearean theater as to African-derived practice, and many do not fully disguise the identity of the performer. We therefore have added a special complication by considering Afro- Creole women's masquerades of the Caribbean along with examples from Zambia, Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Gambia. Their inclusion here will engen- der controversy because they truly push the envelope of what is meant by mas- querade from an African perspective. The justification for doing so has been to see whether they share anything important with African women's masking, and I will try to demonstrate that they do. Most studies of masking have dealt with men's masquerades in which wo- men, along with children and strangers, form the primary audience of noniniti- ates. As H. Peret (1982) and others have recognized, this makes women an essen- tial part of men's masking, since the effi- caciousness of the mask requires its legitimation by those supposedly un- aware that it is an illusion and who accept their own exclusion from the secret of its meaning. This issue of secrecy, discussed in the essays by Ute Roschenthaler and Elisabeth Cameron, is the single most important distinction between men's and women's masking in the cases they describe.l The other major distinction be- tween male and female mask perfor- mance to be drawn from these essays is in the attitudes taken toward embodiment, or more simply, the body as an instru- ment of assertion. Masks in Africa were initially described by outsiders as either subjects of idolatry or elaborate deceptions. Both statements are found in Moore's account in 1738: "I was visited by a Mumbo Jumbo, an Idol, which is among the Mundingoes a kind of cun- ning Mystery" (in Well 1971:279).2 From the beginning this "cunning mystery" has run like a thread through African masking studies: masks embody an illusion of some kind, and it is typically used by men as a form of social control over women (see Tonkin 1988). In one twentieth-century ver- sion of this argument, masks have been cast as highly useful social symbols for gender relations in the community: studies of masks of the Poro, Sande, and Gelede societies have all been paradigmatic of this approach. Poro and Sande have lent themselves to both functionalist and struc- turalist interpretation, including Warren d'Azevedo's reading of complementari- ty between Gola male (Poro) and female (Sande) masking in Liberia (1980) and M. C. Jedrej's of structural inversion and reversal in Sande initiation (1980). French ethnographic tradition pro- duced a discourse unlike the anglophone, but nonetheless deeply concerned with ideas of gender. Marcel Griaule and Ger- maine Dieterlen's work on the Dogon of Mali focused primarily on the cosmo- gonic significance of masking in which a mythic female principle features promi- nently: the red fiber skirt, the periodic birth of a new Great Mask, the role of the Yasigine.

In two of them (Yoruba Gelede and the Dogon dama), men try to encompass or appropri- ate it in their own mask performances. In Sande, women demonstrate it themselves (e.g., Phillips 1995; Figs. 1, 2). Beginning in the late sixties and early seventies, scholars in the United States moved away from the idea of masks as fixed symbols to the idea of masks as objects whose meaning was determined through action. This changed their terms of reference to the processual (Herbert Cole's "art as a verb in Igboland," 1969) and the performative (Robert Farris Thompson's "Icon defines itself as act 20 south of the Sahara," 1974). Students of Cole and Thompson have developed these ideas further. Drawing upon the nexus between theater and ritual, Frederick Lamp (1988), a former Thompson student, has extended these insights in a perfor- mance-centered reading of Temne girls' initiation into Bondo (cf. "Bundu," Sande). In a current variation on the performative model based in feminist theory, attention has shifted from mask to actor and to the agency of the female performer. Judith Bettelheim (also a former Thompson stu- dent) typifies this approach here. One effect of literary theories of recep- tion, deconstruction, and decentering has been to elevate the importance of the read- er, which has caused students of perfor- mance to rethink the situation of actor and audience and to retrieve the playful, im- provisational, and contingent aspects of 2.

With the gradual acceptance of pastiche and hybrid- ity as culturally legitimate, scholars of African art have also begun to focus upon aspects of masking which in the past would have been dismissed as uninterest- ing or illegitimate because of their transpo- sition to arenas of public or official culture (see Reed, a former student of Cole, in this issue). Also, with a few exceptions such as the pioneering work on Freetown Ode-lay masking by John Nunley (1987), and Mary Jo Aroldi's ongoing work on regional Malian puppet masquerades (1995), stud- ies have typically been situated within one ethnic group.3 But while the condition of hybridity as something worthy of study in itself is relatively novel in the scholarship of African masking, it is not at all new to the Diaspora. African masquerades do of course "travel" locally and even have their own regional diasporas, but most remain in cose proximity to their origins. Their genealogies are often known and may even be traceable to a particular lineage in a single ward of a village.4 Caribbean mas- querades, on the other hand, exemplify a performative practice which was bor out of the creolizing forces of an urban (yet plantation- and maroon-derived) slave cul- ture. From the beginning it therefore has called for a more flexible set of theories. Making one's way through this thicket of interpretation is complicated. Never- theless, two different streams which cut through the various historical approaches can be identified in masking theory; one of them treats the mask as a kind of disguise or phantom, and the other treats it as a vehicle (or symbol) of metamorphosis. Somewhat like Rene Caillois's division of the masking phenomenon into "simula- tion and vertigo" (1961), one stream focus- es on the materiality of masking and the other on its behavioral affect. These as- pects of course are not mutually exclu- sive, but connected through practice. The phantom model (the "cunning mystery"), when projected, leads to studies of mime- sis (Cole, "I am not myself") and covert power (Drewal &amp; Drewal 1983). The focus upon metamorphosis led structural func- tionalists to the acting out of framed disor- der and polarized inversions and reversals (Bateson 1972, Peacock 1978), but it is also found in the earlier ethnography of Griaule and Dieterlen, where one finds a detailed set of structural transformations linking masks with primordial incest and the introduction of death in the world. Studies of masquerades which are spiritu- al structures for resurrected ancestors (e.g., Kasfir 1985) also use the transformation model. The recent studies of masking as improvisational play (M. Drewal, Amoldi, african arts ? spring 1998</page><page sequence="4">Strother) draw about equally from both streams, as they deal with both mimesis and transformation. It is not easy to separate the more spe- cific study of masks and women (includ- ing masks of women; see p. 72) from this general body of mask literature, since gender is so salient for masking in gener- al. Writers on both women's masking and women and masks have employed a range of approaches, from the social con- trol of masks by men through masks as cosmological symbols, female solidarity in the form of mask-related associations, rites of inversion and reversal, and femi- nist critiques of myths of matriarchy with women originally controlling the power of masks (Bamberger 1974). If general theories of masking take up the issue of women's relation to masks, one interesting question is then, Should women's masquerades be seen as part of this larger discourse on masks, or do they require a different theoretical ex- planation? In this issue, Judith Bettel- heim suggests the latter in relation to women's festival performances in the Af- rican Diaspora. As already noted, Dias- pora festival performances (whether by women or by men) draw upon a multi- tude of sources and therefore appear on the surface to be sufficiently different from African masquerades to require their own explanatory models. This sets the stage for the introduction of feminist performance theory, though it does not preclude other approaches which speak to Diasporic conditions. But this is quite separate from the ques- tion of whether feminist performance the- spring 1998 ? atrican arts Left: 3.

As it happens, none of the three essays in this issue that are set in sub-Saharan cultures make specific use of performance theory, feminist or otherwise. All three, however (Cameron, Roschenthaler, and Weil), are indebted in various degrees to the femi- nist anthropology of the 1970s as well as the structural-functionalist approaches of the previous academic generation, both of which have been mainstreamed into African art history through studies of masking of the women's Sande society. Although it is not explicitly mentioned in the separate essays, Sande/Bondo in par- ticular has provided the model for study- ing African women's masking in general, with important contributions by d'Azeve- do, Jedrej, Lamp, MacCormack, Phillips, Boone, and others. While the four essays and two re- search notes included here offer com- pelling new evidence of African and Afro-Creole women's involvement with masquerade, some readers will see only Weil's Gambian case as hard-core mask- ing, in the most typical African sense of an embodiment of a spirit presence which renders its carrier invisible. The Cameroonian, Zambian, Cuban, Jamai- can, and Trinidadian cases under discus- sion all involve to various degrees female performance in which the performer's identity is not always hidden by a mask, despite elaborate costuming and the social and aesthetic framing of the perfor- mance as masquerade by its audience (Figs. 3, 12). If secrecy and illusion can be considered the two main components of textbook African masquerades, here one of them-secrecy-drops away. This poses the question once again of whether "masquerading" requires the lit- eral presence of a disguise, or whether the commonly agreed-upon idea of the mask is sufficient. John Picton (1990) raised this issue in regard to the assertions of Anebira men (Nigeria) that the actual mask artifact was only essential to masking if women were present. Without the women around, men were free to invoke and perform spir- it presences without the encumbrance of the masks themselves. When the audience is made up entirely of initiates, secrecy is no longer an issue. But if one argues that the efficacy of masking itself depends pre- cisely on the presence of an audience of outsiders, where does that leave us? It seemingly places masking in a cloud of ambiguity, which is exactly where the women's performances described here seem to lie. In another example, Cesare Poppi has described how in northern Ghana, secret parapheralia for a night performance of the Vagla Sigma society was prepared in full view of noninitiates passing by (1993:201). This exposure of things normally concealed was consid- ered safe, because even if the women and children could look at what was happen- ing, they could not really "see" (in the sense of fathom) what was going on. Both examples reveal that the question of secre- cy, at least in masking, can be uncoupled from that of concealment-a crucial con- sideration in women's masks which do not conceal the wearer's identity. Female Assertiveness, Women's Bodies, and "Acting Out" At one end of a spectrum of masking con- ventions (where Sande/Bondo masks would also reside), Weil describes nine- teenth-century masquerades by Mandinka women employing masks, fashioned from 21</page><page sequence="5">cloth, beads, and calabashes, which con- ceal the carrier from the largely female audience. Unlike Sande masks, they occurred within a broad social context in which women's sexuality was thought to be dangerous, "hot," and requiring control through ritual action. Occupying the mid- dle ground are those practices described by R6schenthaler for Ejagham women and by Cameron for Luvale, Lunda, and other Zambian women. In these, no actual face disguise is employed, but their perfor- mance is interpreted by the audience (especially in the terminology employed to describe them) as "the same as" men's masquerade. In 1986 and 1993 Monni Adams published articles on a women's performance genre called woodwe among the Western We of Cote d'Ivoire which also falls within this range, though its facial paint in at least one example was suf- ficiently elaborate to obscure the wearer's identity (1986:47). The contemporary Diaspora examples offered by Franco and Bettelheim in this issue are at the other extreme from Sande. In these examples, masks are not neces- sarily worn (though they are part of the larger Carnival system), the audiences are heterogeneous, and the transformations, at least historically, have a good deal 22 more to do with an Afro-Creole social imaginary and the transcending of race and class barriers than with the embodi- ments of spirits.5 Caribbean spectacles are polysemic events in which masquerades not only entertain but also construct cul- tural memory as a usable past. Examples of "dressing up" (or, sometimes, stripping down) as described here become highly visible assertions of women's social histo- ry, sexuality, and presence. This is true even of ritual dress such as worn by initi- ates of Bahian Candomble (Fig. 4). As Mikelle Omari has commented: These costumes not only signal the degree of power the wearer possess- es, but communicate her preroga- tives....Costumes of the gods serve tripartite functions as offerings, aes- thetic displays and perpetuation of the religion. By extension they also serve to sustain the power of the Afro-Brazilian women who are care- takers of this religion. (Omari 1990:41) The theme of women's assertiveness is therefore a part of all these performances, regardless of other factors. In her research note Judith Bettelheim argues that in the Caribbean at least, we Left: 5. "Sexy dancers" atop a trio electrico for Bloco da Aurora. Carnival, Bahia, Brazil, 1981. Photo: Doran H.

Instead she extends the definition of masquerade beyond this to encompass "acting out," which she sees as evidence of women's agency in situations where they are acting to symbolically destabilize a male-regulat- ed social order. She cites the example of the Igbo Women's War of 1929, when women demonstrated publicly against the British colonial administration (some paying for it with their lives), comparing this to the intentionally transgressive behavior of the Caribbean "sexy dancer" in street perfor- mances (Fig. 5). We therefore have to consider whether "acting out" can be seen as a kind of masquerade practice. Both Bettelheim and Franco argue that in the Caribbean, it can be. But for Africa, there's ambiguity again: sometimes yes and sometimes no. There are forms of female militancy which are seen by african arts ? spring 1998</page><page sequence="6">the community that uses them simply as women's assertiveness in the face of men's obstinacy or men's attempts to dominate women beyond an acceptable limit. The Women's War, which was a protest against the rumored plans of a (male) colonial ad- ministration to tax women, is that kind of example. But there are other kinds of female militancy, equally assertive, which take the form of ritual action meant to over- ride male authority in order to repair dam- age to the social order. Both types of militancy usually involve the same kinds of behavioral transgressions: the verbal abuse of men, occasionally physical humiliation of them as well, and threats of (or actual) public nudity, particularly by older women (see Ardener 1975). The first type (e.g., the Women's War) might be termed "acting out," because it is openly transgressive and the outcome is uncertain to everyone in- volved. The second, because it is a ritually framed kind of disorder, does not carry the same threat of uncertainty. Instead it fol- lows a set of cultural rules known in advance to everyone in the community. It differs in a second way from militant protests: it actually overrides male author- ity and is not simply transgressive behav- ior. For example, ndoli jowei, the principal Sande masquerade, was used in the past spring 1998 ? arlican arts to discipline male offenders of Sande laws. In her study of Mende Sande masquer- ades, Ruth Phillips (1995:86) quotes an early colonial writer, H. O. Newland: The "medicine" which the devil is supposed to have at her command is much feared, and no man who has transgressed a Bondu law, and is pointed out by the devil, dare refuse to follow her, and to pay the fine or other penalty the headman metes out. A flogging is one of the penalties inflicted for leading a Bondu girl astray. (Newland 1916:125) These kinds of female ritual militancy are not limited to West Africa or cultures that use masks. Samburu women in northern Kenya periodically organize a ritual delegation called the Lamal to demand blessings, redress grievances, and remind men that they are not power- less, despite their limited access to capital and livestock (Fig. 6).6 If they are truly angry about some injustice, rather than merely high-spirited, the delegation be- comes a mob, playfulness becomes actual aggression, and "nip turns to bite" (Bateson 1972).7 In this situation, which rarely happens but which people remem- 7.

The boundary between these two forms of women's mil- itancy is therefore not inviolable and occasionally breaks down. Ejagham women resort to ritual action when an important community norm regarding women has been violated. Like women among several other peoples in the Nigeria-Cameroon region, they use ritual nudity in a dance performed under the cover of darkness. Just as with the men's "night masks" in this region, darkness itself provides the "mask," and the male "audi- ence" is enjoined to stay locked indoors during the performance. Roschenthaler argues that instead of using masks, women use their nakedness, which acts as a curse affecting men's potency. In this way they are able to use masking to restore order to male-female relations in the community. The "sexy dancer" in a Caribbean street per- formance seems to invoke the first type of militancy (socially unbounded). But it is the second type (ritually bounded), performed by the Ejagham women, which is closer to the established concept of masquerade. Playing Around with Female Agency In men's masking, it is women who must maintain the fiction of the mask's secret. Paradoxically, given this "ignorance," they nonetheless are the original owners of masks in numerous mythic traditions in Africa and elsewhere. The version found among the Ejagham is discussed in Roschenthaler's essay: women discovered the secret of Ngbe, the leopard spirit, while fishing. They took it home, but one women revealed the secret to her husband and the men appropriated it for them- selves. A lesser-known story is found about two hundred miles north of the Cross River in southern Idoma (Igwumale kingdom), in which women were fishing with traps when the water turned red and the unaaloko masquerade suddenly rose up out of the water (Fig. 7). The women fled but the masquerade followed them home, where it was taken over by men. It is nonetheless claimed to represent a woman, a royal slave, and women must call out praises before it can perform (Kasfir 1979, 1986). It is easy to dismiss these mythologies as merely instrumental-men using myth to historicize and validate the male-domi- nated social order. We have to assume, however, that women know the myths as well as men do (Pemet 1982). And in a few 23</page><page sequence="7">8.

Photo: Sidney Littlefield Kasfir. places (more than is usually acknowl- edged), women actually do mask, or did within living memory. Weil's description of Mandinka women's masking is a pow- erful example. Even where women do not mask themselves but act as spectators to men's masquerades, they have developed strategies to make use of the mask's effica- cy. Bess Reed's research note gives one Igbo example which demonstrates that exclusion from the "secret" does not mean exclusion from the masquerade's social usefulness. However, from the male point of view there are legitimate and illegiti- mate ways for women to "use" masks. The illegitimate ways are those in which control of the mask's power is no longer mediated by men. In short, women's ability to capture and make use of a mask's power is at work in the masquerading scenario whether or not they are the initiates who know the mask's "secret." That men take this female agency very seriously can be judged from the elaborate rhetoric they frequently employ to keep women away from masks. Every Idoma girl and woman is told the story of Onne, who was buried alive up to the shoulders (a punishment con- cocted by her own father) after surrepti- tiously looking upon the Alekwuafia, the most powerful of masquerades, in its sacred enclosure and reporting its secrets to women (Anyebe n.d.:8). The last re- ported death of an Idoma woman for transgressing these rules occurred as re- cently as the 1950s. There were also a host of other threats concerning the revelation of mask secrets by Idoma women, from the poison oracle to infertility to impreg- nation by the masquerade spirit. It there- fore should not be surprising that in a few cultures (not Idoma but Ejagham, Luvale, and formerly Wuli Mandinka) this female agency is recognized by the community as being "the same as" the power mani- fested in men's masquerades. Men in these areas seem to acknowledge the potential of women's masquerade as a sign of ritual assertiveness, even while usually maintaining the exclusive privi- lege of secrecy for themselves. For the women, this acknowledgment has led in some places to the development of rituals parallel to the men's, such as the masquerade which wears no mask. It sug- gests that in places where masking is a well- established part of the social fabric, and everyone knows its rules and parameters, it may be possible to play with those rules a bit to avoid gender transgressions which are too threatening, but at the same time to allow women to express their solidarity and (often very considerable) influence. This 24 degree of playfulness would have been unthinkable in a conservative society such as Idoma in the 1970s and '80s, so I hesi- tate to generalize about these possibilities continent-wide. The play element in mask- ing varies greatly according to who wears the mask and for whom, where, when, and why a masquerade performance takes place. Yet the labile quality of many mask- ing situations (e.g., Weston 1985, M. Drewal 1992, Strother 1995) leads to the bending and even breaking of the rules. Dangerous Sexual Energy Peter Weil's essay is an extraordinary ac- count of masked performances by both Muslim and non-Muslim Mande-speak- ing women in the Senegambian state of Wuli during the nineteenth and early twentieth century. It appears that women's masking in this area was widely practiced as a means of socializing girls to adult sta- tus by playing out female roles in Mande society. Although controlled by female elders, these masquerades cut across all age grades, from girls to the most senior women. They were demonstrated for Weil in 1976 by elderly women who remembered either seeing or hearing about the performances when they were young. The masks (constructed mainly through ingenious cloth-tying) usually impersonated bush animals. Of the ten masks Weil describes, two of them, the Potto and Mother Elephant, are of partic- ular interest for their comparative value to the other essays. The Potto, a masquerade which in its nineteenth-century form was enacted by a naked female initiate covered only with cay or ash, impersonated the small noctur- nal primate known as the potto, which car- ries its young on its back. It appeared in the final set of events known as the Revelation of the Secret of the Land Turtle, which fol- lowed the girls' excision rituals. Both the land turtle and the potto are bush animals with mystical connections to the fertility of humans and the land. Further, Weil likens the nocturnal habits of the potto to the time and place women are thought to manifest their covert power. In its original unclothed form (it acquired a loincloth in the twen- tieth century), the Potto mask's noctunal power and secrecy were combined with nudity in a way that is strikingly similar to Ejagham women's dancing naked in the darkness: the metaphorical formula is composed of very similar ingredients though used for a distinctly different ritual purpose. In both instances the exposure of the female body in performance connotes a sexuality which is potentially dangerous to the social order. In one case, though, it is seen by a female audience, while in the other, men are the "audience" yet are not allowed to be spectators. Each is socially embedded in a very different discourse on female power, its uses, and its limits in a male-dominated social order. The Potto masquerade, seen in a wider perspective, is a performative trope for Senegambian Mande beliefs concerning the "hot" mystical energy generated by women's sexuality: namely, it is poten- tially antisocial and must be regulated by a variety of ritual means. According to Weil, these include the performance of ritual excision in order to control desire, and the tattooing of the gums and lips blue (a color associated with the cooling effect of male energy) to control women's speech. The masking system was a third way in which women themselves incul- cated their own social values while also celebrating their solidarity. One specific social message in the Potto mask's performance was generated by its exaggerated hunchback posture, which Weil interprets as a reference to Sogolon, the hunchback mother of the Mande hero Sunjaata, and a model of female probity, bravery, and loyalty in Mande myth. Interestingly, Weil says the hunchback was also a source of Sogolon's mystical power which linked her with the forces of the Wild. Potto/Sogolon was nature/nur- turance in a dichotomized universe. It was clearly a figure of approbation for its audi- ence of women and girls, and was far removed from the varieties of "acting out" associated with transgressive nudity. This epistemology of the body is unlike that invoked by the Ejagham Ekpa-Atu associ- ation, in which women dance naked, clothed only in darkness, to restore order when a community law or norm relating to women has been violated.

One realizes that female nudity in performance can sig- nify very different things. From Elephant Women to Cabildo Queens The Wuli Mandinka women's masquer- ades were firmly implanted in a social order which (like Sande/Poro) at one time distributed ritual power to both women and men in similar measure. They provide a powerful set of metaphors for under- standing why women's masquerade per- formances occur. A fine example described by Weil is the Mother Elephant mask and its attendant meanings. In any polygynous household, each woman and her children form a basic unit of the family. In an ele- phant family herd, an older female leads her daughters and their calves. Each is a matrifocal group. Weil suggests that the elephant family provided a metaphor for the organization of non-Muslim Mandinka women's lives. The herd's formation had its parallel in the Wuli female initiation cycle, beginning with the girls' barango and ending with the initiation of elderly women into the secrets of the Mother Elephant. When the elephant mask per- formed, it was in the bush and seen only by the eldest women of the senior age grade. Two points seem salient: the assimila- tion of the powers of elder women into the mystical and dangerous forces of the bush, and elder women's social position as recep- tacles of knowledge. Everywhere in Africa, the intelligence and quasi-human character of the elephant are recognized (Ross 1994). Like elephants, elder women possess mys- tical knowledge, intelligence, and the ex- perience to use these qualities in helping younger females realize their potential.8 The Mother Elephant mask distilled these qualities for the Wuli Mandinka. It is also worth noting that in C6te d'Ivoire, the We women's masquerade known as woodwe was glossed as "resembles an elephant," though the reference apparently was not to the possession of mystical knowledge but to the woman who "decides to act like a man" (Adams 1986:54). Elisabeth Cameron's paper provides another masking metaphor for the ele- mental nature of women's power: the mask of fire, in which a Ganguela female performer in Angola wears a headdress of slowly burning twigs. Masks of sticks, leaves, or branches are among the most ancient forms found in Africa and are often ritually powerful. When combined with fire the image becomes truly daunt- ing, to be looked upon only from a safe distance-a mask whose movement was both "furious and majestic" (Martinho van Koolwijk, quoted in Cameron). The power of women acting together is seen again in the existence of associations such as Ngbogha-Ndem and Njom-Ekpa among Ejagham women and their many near and distant counterparts: St. Lucia dance societies like the Rose and Mar- guerite, or those within the mixed-gender royal cabildos of Santiago de Cuba. Parad- ing publicly, each group contains an en- tourage headed by its senior women, and in the cabildos, a queen. In the Njom-Ekpa in southwestern Cameroon, one woman dances with the association's headdress on spring 1998 ? atrican arts her head, and in some villages she is sur- rounded by four attendants, each guiding her movements with a mirror. The bulky headdress takes the form of a box con- taining a diorama of carved figures (most importantly the founding ancestress). It is balanced in place by the dancer, who grasps lengths of cloth attached to the sides, a visual analogy to the canopy draped with scarves used by the nine- teenth-century cabildo dancer Bettelheim cites, or to the cloth canopy for the queen in the Trinidad drum dances called bou- quets, described by Franco.9 In Idoma a senior woman may dance with an im- portant female figure on her head, such as the ekwotame ("god-with-breasts") of Otukp'icho, eliding the distinction between men's masking and women's praise danc- ing to deified female ancestors (Fig. 8). The Njom-Ekpa "mask," then, is car- ried on top of the head, as in many Cross River men's masquerades. The difference is that the dancer's face is not veiled. The Ejagham told Roschenthaler that this was only a practical matter: the men's mas- querades (like the women's night dances) are used to enforce the law, and for this, anonymity is essential. As Georg Simmel observed, the most effective form of pro- tection is invisibility (1950:345). In short, the Ejagham claim there is no metaphys- ical reason why secrecy is required. We might also remind ourselves that Ngbe, the leopard spirit for whom Njom-Ekpa is said to be a mythic substitute, is a "maskless" masquerade wearing a head- to-ankle knitted body costume. For none of these masquerades is the performer's face or its disguise the visual focus. And what of the Zambian masquerade, called likishi (pl. makishi)? In the context of the men's initiation, mukanda, it wears a carved or fiber face with its costume. But at 25</page><page sequence="9">women's initiations in Kabompo District, Cameron saw women using the same dance steps as male makishi, only dressed slightly differently and using white face paint instead of masks (Fig. 9). She argues that women do not need the secrecy required by men's initiation. The central fiction of the mukanda, on the other hand, is a man impersonating the presence of a spirit. Further, the spirit of the mukanda must be empowered, people believe, by stolen menstrual blood, which has the power to "cancel" all other medicines. Cameron concluded that women have no need of this kind of secrecy because they are the source of power which men must appropriate to empower the makishi masks. The Caribbean: Mas Without Masks All these points tend toward the decon- struction of the raison d'etre of masquerade and the uncoupling of secrecy and illusion. It seems clear that masking in the sense of encoding a different identity for the per- former need not require the element of secrecy if its purpose is not deception or "social control." But as long as one assumes that masks are essentially about spirit man- ifestation,10 or at the very least "cunning mysteries" meant to deceive the uninitiat- ed, then several of the women's perfor- mances described in this issue are outside the masking rubric. Instead they force us to ask, How transformative is dress (or undress) alone? If we shift the emphasis in the discussion from masking as spirit embodiment to masking as spectacle," 26 with its corresponding shift from an audi- ence of believers to one of spectators, we are in a better position to understand the Trinidadian Afro-Creole women's mas- querades, which Pamela Franco describes as "dressing up and looking good." "Looking good" is something of an understatement if one reads the descrip- tions of nineteenth-century balls in Mar- tinique, Trinidad, and Jamaica. Dazzling groups of female performers danced in elaborate matching or complementary costumes derived from European cou- ture. Franco describes the Trinidadian fashion of the douillette, adopted from Martinique, in which the hem of a coat- like gown was raised to expose a decorat- ed underskirt, the whole look completed by a painted turban and copious jewelry. Bettelheim mentions the Jamaican Set Girls, also seen in the nineteenth century, wearing identical red or blue minutely detailed ensembles, created for the dance competitions sponsored by the Kingston Naval Squadron. How does one evaluate this type of transformation which "references a dif- ferent time and place"? Bettelheim argues that the Set Girls were more than just Afro-Creole women emulating upper- class English or French dress, and there- by performing a classic rite of inversion during a festive public occasion such as Christmas or a pre-Lenten celebration. She asks that we think of such perform- ers as producers, not carriers, of mean- ing-and as such they, not the audience, are in control. This interpretation of course depends upon whose perspective Left: 10. Baby Doll mas. Carnival, Trinidad, 1995. Photo: Noel Norton. Right: 11.

Reinterpreting nineteenth-century events in the light of contemporary performance theory allows scholars to develop rich alternative readings of what was actually happening, but it is important not to con- flate this with the self-representations of performers at the time. Unlike the case of the contemporary street dancer, we can- not participate in their social milieu except through the inscriptions of eye- witnesses of the time, which may be inci- sive or vague, poetic or disinterested, but almost invariably male. Yet, careful scrutiny suggests interest- ing possibilities. In her detailed descrip- tion of the nineteenth-century Trinidadian masqueraders, Franco argues that by wearing a pointedly anti-English fashion such as the Martiniquan dress, Afro- Creole women were able to express their own solidarity with one another and cre- ate an identity distinctly their own. So, too, the performances by the Cuban cabil- dos and also those at the Trinidadian drum dances were, in Bettelheim's words, "pub- lic displays of rank and authority." They were frequently visual referents to a trans- posed authority structure such as that seen in a fictive European court. In this african arts * spring 1998</page><page sequence="10">12.

Photo: Pamela Franco. case the desired appearance was chosen from an array of theatrical and literary possibilities, sometimes subversivel2 and at other times emulative of the privileges of race and class. What is indisputable is that high artifice and hybridity were the most marked characteristics of these per- formances. Franco's description of the Afro-Trinidadian women's appropriation of a white elite's symbols of opulence re- contextualized within a West African cloth aesthetic makes this very clear. The reasons for the elaborate artifice were partly aesthetic, but there is evi- dence of contemporary politicking as well. Franco's research on the Bajan Cook Car- nival mas popular from 1911 to 1931 sug- gests a strong connection between the plight of domestic workers in Trinidad (which included Bajans, or Barbadians), the emergent trade union movement, and the performance of the masquerade. At other times artifice took on a different mean- ing. Historical and mythological mas (e.g., designer Peter Minshall's "Odyssey" of 1994; Fig. 3), unlike those of a social catego- ry such as the Bajan Cook, create an issue of authenticity for the performer. A female band leader of the 1950s assured Franco that the ethnicity of the masker had to (appear to) match the one being portrayed; thus her 1953 rendition of "Elizabeth and Raleigh" featured 125 women, each coiffed in a period wig and wearing a pinkish wire- screen mask. The purpose of the face mask here was to effect an illusion rather than to make a secret of the masker's identity. On the other hand, we know that government authorities, in periods of political instability, banned the wearing of face masks for this very reason, so that mas could not mask subversion as well as play. Women per- formers nonetheless wear them today if the representation calls for it (Figs. 10, 11). The Commoditization of Spectacle A final point needs to be made in the com- parison of women's masquerade in Africa and the Caribbean. One is accustomed to the African mask as a collectible market commodity, but one needs to incorporate masquerade performance into that world too. It is "collected" as touristic experience, though significantly more in the Diaspora, where urban spectacles such as Mardi Gras and Carnival are multimillion dollar businesses and major tourist attractions. For example, Peter Minshall, the most cel- ebrated costume designer for Trinidad Carnival (Fig. 14), also designed an open- ing-ceremony display for the Olympic Games in both Barcelona and Atlanta. In fact, the "model" of Trinidad Carnival has been successfully exported to many other spring 1998 ? afrlcan arts cities, from Brooklyn to Notting Hill and even to Jamaica as Orange Carnival. At the same time, for its own urban partici- pants and audiences, Trinidad Carnival is as socially and historically embedded as any African masquerade (Figs. 10, 11). Its commoditization seems not to have di- minished its power as a symbol for Trini- dadian audiences, and may have even enhanced it through the international rec- ognition brought by its marketing and media coverage. Like the Olympics, Car- nival allows whole cultures to celebrate and represent themselves at a level of high artifice which is nonetheless an accurate reflection of their collective imaginary. It should be dear by now that the rural/urban dichotomy is sometimes more important than the Africa/Diaspora one. Mask events performed in a rural context (it could be Cameroon or Haiti) typically have performers, audiences, and participants who are well known to one another, and by comparison are barely commoditized at all, unless one counts the occasional home videos of performances made by elite sons- of-the-soil returning from their city jobs, or the small "dashes" paid to performers trav- eling from other villages. Unusual cases with regular audiences of foreigners, such as the organized tours from Bamako to Dogon country in Mali, would be what Arjun Appadurai (1986) terms "encaved commodities" at best. The spatio-temporal distinctions (who is allowed to see what, and where) made between the various phases of a Dogon dama are applied even more rigorously to dances for foreign tourists. For example, in the village of Ogol they are performed near the post office on the edge of town (Lane 1988), a colonially demarcated space which carries a symbolic identity different from that of the buildings and spaces of the residential parts of the vil- lage. Not only are they performed in a dif- ferent time and space, they also provide an opportunity for individual dancers to dis- play their virtuosity in exchange for cash rewards and for other transactions such as the sale of masks made for the occasion (Van Beek 1991a, Hoffman 1993). In its final phase the contemporary dama has come to emulate, on a much smaller scale, a public spectacle, except that women have not yet entered the performance frame. In Africa these types of commoditization are almost always in the hands of men, because they control not only the operation of the mask system but also transactions with strangers. Although it is not an event staged for foreign tourists, the same point holds true for the Nigerian Enugu State-sponsored mask festival which Bess Reed writes about. Nowadays masks perform not only in villages and urban streets but in soccer stadiums, in competitions at agricultural shows, and at self-help fund-raisers for local schools and clinics short of govern- ment funding. Despite the major differ- ence this makes in the construction of the event, the composition of the audiences, their distance (both spatial and psychic) from the performers, and their calendrical periodicity (e.g., M. Drewal 1992:161-71), women may still find themselves in the same relationship to men's masking. In the event that Reed attended, their enforced distancing from the men's masquerades followed the same clearly demarcated boundaries in an Enugu soccer stadium (where women were not allowed onto the field with the masquerades) as would hap- pen in a village in the Igbo hinterland. It is a reminder of how deeply gendered mask- ing roles are in Africa. For the female performer in the Dias- pora, the much greater commoditization of masquerade spectacle has more direct effects: the introduction after World War II of Carnival Queen competitions in Trini- dad based on American beauty pageants is one part of a complex picture presented by Pamela Francol3; Judith Bettelheim's sexy street dancer is another. With daily flights from New York and Miami, a mobile pop- ulation reinterprets North American as well as Caribbean popular culture from television, films, music videos, and glossy magazines. In all of these, images of women and womanhood abound. As a result, "looking good" as well as "acting out" meant one thing in the nineteenth cen- tury but means something quite different today. Less lady-like and more assertive, these transformations still do require a "mask" of some kind to cover their trans- gressions, but like their Cameroonian and Zambian counterparts, it is no longer a secret, either cunning or mysterious.

This is less so for the Gambian masks discussed by Weil, in which both male and female types incorporated the element of concealed power. 2. For Mumbo Jumbo in its Caribbean context see Nunley &amp; Bettelheim 1988. 3. Thompson's seminal African Art in Motion (1974) cut across these categories by considering several case studies at once. 4. For example, the historically senior Akweya akpnmobe mask of central Idomaland, which is found only in the Ekpari clan of two villages. 5. This is not to say that all Diaspora masquerades fit this model: there are well-known examples such as Candomble in Bahia which do not. 6. Women in a large group move from one settlement to anoth- er singing, dancing, and demanding gifts and blessings. Men who do not cooperate are ostracized and publicly insulted. 7. In one case documented by Paul Spencer, the women pun- ished an elder who had raped a young girl by seizing him, stomping on his genitals, and then slaughtering and cooking his favorite ox (Spencer 1988:206). 8. The connection is very explicit in Samburu culture (where elephants are still a part of everyday life). See Fratkin 1974. 9. Judith Bettelheim has told me that the cloth canopy is also found in West Africa (personal communication, March 10, 1998). 10. This is analogous to assuming that ritual is about the sacred. Both are conditions which would hold true for some, but certainly not all, instances in Africa. 11. I use spectacle to mean the public display of a society's central meaningful elements by which it periodically re- invents itself. Carnival is one example, the Olympic games another (MacAloon 1984, DaMatta 1990, Beeman 1993). 12. Numerous sources have documented insurrections against slave-holders and other forms of subversion which were orga- nized at drum dances, religious meetings, and festival perfor- mances, and, in North America, at ring-shouts. 13.

ROSCHENTHALER: Notes, from page 49 This article is based on field research carried out in 1987 and 1988 among the Ejagham of southwestern Cameroon. It was supported by the Nachwuchsforderung des Landes Berlin and the German Academic Exchange Service. I extend my thanks to all the Ejagham women and men who assisted me in the field and responded with patience to my questions. Shirley Ardener, Brunhilde Biebuyck, Sally Chilver, Sidney Littlefield Kasfir, Heidrun Mader, Zoe Strother, and Tobias Wendl have read earlier drafts of this article, and I am grateful for their comments. Any remain- ing infelicities are my own. 1. Among the Lega of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the wives of members of the Bwami society dance with masks (Biebuyck 1985). Among the Bokyi of the Cross River area, Keith Nicklin describes a mask of the Egbeghe women's association which is danced by a woman whose body and face are completely veiled in cloth (1974:15). Sometimes, too, women may create a masked dance in response to a topical event, but it does not develop into a permanent institution (Staschewski 1917, Weston 1984). 2. For example, there is Nsibiri, which was gradually re- placed by Ngbe at the turn of the century, and associations in which successful hunters could be initiated (Okwa, Ncebe, Nkpe, and Ndum-Ngang, to mention just a few). 3. This is contrary to the usual West African practice, in which girls are secluded and circumcised before pregnancy. In areas bordering towns, especially in the Nigerian part of the Ejagham country, today some girls are circumcised right after birth. This does not, however, apply to first-born daughters, who are sup- posed to undergo the monenkim seclusion. 4. The term refers not only to this grade of the Leopard soci- ety (Nkanda) but also its members and its performance (nkanda). 5. According to Ejagham custom a ngbogha-ndem was circum- cised after the birth of her first child, not at the beginning of her initiation. 6. Other women and men, including the drummers, honorary members of the association, did not have anthropomorphic statues erected after their deaths. In recent decades rich fam- ilies have started to place crosses and other sculptures made of cement on the graves of deceased family members. 7. I do not describe them extensively here, since they are quite well known. According to Nicklin (1974:8), Ejagham carvers (and those of other ethnic groups at the Cross River) are the only ones in the world who have specialized in the compli- cated process of covering masks with skin. For a summary of that process see Campbell 1983. In the '70s Nicklin met sev- eral carvers who were still able to cover headpieces with antelope skin. 8. Among those authors who have described the dance chore- ography are Jones 1945; Blier 1980:8-9; Nicklin in Vogel 1981:170. 9. This is the only point on which all the literature on skin- covered masks does indeed agree. 10. For a summary of the literature on the nsibiri and the skin- covered masks in international museums and private collec- tions, see Campbell 1981, 1983. 11. The dancers of Angbu carry them at public festivals, but the Ngbe association does not own any sculpted heads. It has often been said that the skin-covered heads were owned by Ngbe, but this is the case only with the older association sometimes called Nsibiri, which was replaced by Ngbe. Angbu and Ngbe dancers never appear together. Angbu is responsible for minor infractions and Ngbe for the major ones. References cited Acholonu, Catherine O. 1985.
