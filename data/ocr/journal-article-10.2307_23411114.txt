His attitude towards all forms of Melanesian art was to let their producers tell the story, which he extensively did in his interlinear transcriptions of texts, published in 1913. One of the first to recoenize the sones and tales of the neon le of the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomons, he published a comprehensive volume of this material ( I hurnwald 1912b). Moreover, in his adaptation or Buin songs and tales, as well in his private letters, he showed a remarkable ability for literature and poet ry himself in the readable narrative style he used in nresenrin? the stories hehinrl rhe sonps. Never theless, colleagues researching Melanesian art still wonder why Thurnwald, in spite of his knowledge, seldom refers to the rank of special objects within Figure i.

Born the 18th of September 1869 in Vienna the son of a middle-class immigrant from rural Bohemia, he grew up in the melting pot of the Osterreich-Ungarische Donaumonarchie (Austro Hungarian Danube Monarchy). His peasant and the center of the booming industrial development in Vienna, to which people from all over middle and eastern Europe immigrated, gave him his first deep impressions of different ways of life. Thurnwald s main collections Thurnwald visited Melanesia twice in the prolific years of German ethnography before World War I. He was the first researcher in this part of the world with a harkcrrnnnd in snrinlncrv and nsvrhnlncrv Despite his tremendously productive life - more than 500 publications — even contemporaries in the forties and fifties did not realize that he once was a collector for the Berlin Ethnological Museum. He collected not only artifacts, but phonographic recordings, photographs, anthropological material and data, myths and songs as well as vocabularies. From his first expedition to the Pacific in 1906-1909 alone he brought back 3,150 artifacts documenting and elucidating all aspects of life, 200 skulls and 300 anthropological measurements, 2,200 photographs and 340 phonographic recordings. (Thurnwald 1910:99) The total number of artifacts he collected from his second journey as a member of the Kaiserin-Angusta-riufs Expedition (Sepik River Expedition) 1912—1915 is still unknown, but may number at least 2000. In the summer of 1913, after the main expedition left New Guinea, it was report ed that about 5,800 objects had been acquired by Behrmann, Roesicke, andThurnwald (Penck 1913). 85% of these collections went to the Berlin Museum, the remaining 15% were distributed to the museums in Liibeck, Dresden, Stuttgart, and Munich.

Thurnwald started his university studies with Roman law and law history in 1890. His teacher, Adolf Exner,taught his students to recognize human rights and political situations as analogous to phe nomena in natural history; an idea that became cru ciai ro i nurnwaia s scienunc worK. in nis eariy years Thurnwald took courses in Turkish and Arabian, and studied old Indian philology and National Economy. Thurnwald was in close contact with the ideas of social pioneers. Solving social problems through knowledge in the sociological and physio l : l ui j i I • _ru:_ turers — the sciences of Sociology and Psychology were just developing at the turn of the century, only decades later becoming established disciplines like ethnology. (For more information see Melk-Koch 1989.) Although during his vouth Thurnwald lived in the same street as Felix von Luschan, another cru cial person in anthropology and the question of art, it is not yet clear when they first met. He was a life long close friend of Rudolf Poch, founder of the Anthropological Institute in Vienna. After receiving his degree in jurisprudence, Thurnwald in 1896 became an administradve offi cer in the bosnian-Herzegovian government.

In Bosnia we can see i nurnwaiu s nrsi reai ciose contacr wirn wnar we can material culture. Thurnwald received a grant to ana lyze old traditional manufacturers and commercial enterprises and to develop ideas as to how to keep their ancient knowledge alive. Thurnwald s views on objects' were strongly con nected with the social and economic situation of their producers. He was aware of the traditional crafts and concerned with people's struggle to sur vive by selling their wares. Back in 1890 he had taken part in marketing research and recommended the 54 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">selling of home products to a wider market. Now he was concerned with promoting these handicraft products on the European market. Returning from a voyage to Egypt, Thurnwald began his career as an administrator in Graz on the southern slope or the Alps. Acquainted with one or the founders of Sociology, Ludwig Gumplowicz, he continued with his studies nf human sorietv anrl its structure, considering them both from an historical as well as a contemporary point of view. How human society developed and wnat Kind or dominant processes were involved became the most important mipçrinnc in nThiirnwalH'ç nwn cripntifir life Eventually deciding to study Ethnology, Thurnwald left Graz and went together with his friend Pôch to live in Berlin. Berlin at that period was a center for anthropological and philological studies; the Kônigliches Museum fur Volkerkunde (Royal Ethnological Museum) was well known for its rapid ly growing collections later made famous by the sci entists who were trained there. Germany, in contrast a. ui„ 1 colonies, bringing back not only artifacts but testi monies and records of the life of'primitive people.' Before Thurnwald started his work as a Wissenschaftlicher Hilfsarbeiter (scientific assis tant) under Felix von Luschan in the Afrikanisch Ozeanische Abteilung (Afro-Oceanic Department) at the Museum fiir Vôlkerkunde in 1901, he wrote a monograph on State and Economy in ancient hgypt, without even mentioning the great items this culture had produced. (Thurnwald 1901). In the fol lowing years he took courses in Egyptology, Assyriology, and Anthropology/ Ethnology and started to collect material on money, including early ^11 rr/=»n/~if»c from oil r»vf»r th#3 wnrlrl Fnr PYomnlp hp made drawings of pearls in the British Museum in London and did extensive research into the histori cal aspects of the subject. Obviously he was as inter estea in materials in tne Droaa mental ana econom ic aspects of money, but he never published his results.

On the contrary, he was a very skilled describer, as becomes obvious from these notes. In addition to his job of working with the col lection items, he published a further study on State and Economy, this time using the newly found archaeological testimonies of Hammurabi, and sev eral voluminous articles on human societv. His analysis was always concerned with drawing solu tions for contemporary social problems. In these naners — esneciallv in one about rhe difference of town and countryside — he developed his concept of'sifting,' a social process evoked by migration and contact of different culture «muns that takes nlace within societies to bring personalities with special attributes into certain positions and that may affect genetic cnange or a population in tne long run. it is still a topic in Sociology and Anthropology today (see Melk-Koch 1989,1996). Preparations and Research in the South Seas In 1906 Thurnwald took the opportunity to go on a field trip to New Guinea, to do research in the àeas rrotectoratej ror the newly rounded Arthur Baessler-Stiftung (Arthur Baessler Foundation) on UCllclll U1 L 11 C UC11111 l—i lllllUIU^lLdl xviuatuin. Considering that Thurnwald's research up to this aate was almost exclusively connnea to tne in ear East, Europe, and Africa, von Luschan's choice to send Thurnwald as a collector and researcher to the South Seas is somewhat surprising. But as a social scientist and as a collector for the museum, i hurnwald had ail the necessary background to pro duce excellent results. Moreover, he was in the best of health and experienced in open-air life, being a keen alpine climber and sports fan. In addition he was wealthy enough to put some of his own money .1 • . r?_„ ti 1 J :^ _ _l 11 Ill LU lue i vji i nuiiivvaiu 11 vvao ex v,iituiv,ii^v, to get first-hand information on so-called 'primitive societies' "because there is almost no other spot on the globe that permits so good a glimpse into life _i .il. •. *i:_ 1 _ • UIIIUUV^ULU ijy uui v^i v iiiz/aiiwii anu jlui wn ao it went on with our ancestors many thousand years ago" (Thurnwald 1936:314).

The choice of sending out a social scientist such as Thurnwald with his wide abilities proved a unique nnnnrtnnirv fnr pfhnnlnov Feliv vnn T.iisrhan's desire was to fill the gaps in knowledge and items in the Berlin museum. Von Luschan's holistic attitude is still valid today. In close contact with travellers and July 2000 55</page><page sequence="4">colonial officers in Berlin, he was aware of newly found cultures and their artifacts and was keen to get examples for his department. Thurnwald's main task was to collect ethnological ana anthropological specimens and acquire all the necessary data con nected with their production and use, including tales and legends, dances and songs. In short, he was to carry out stationary fieldwork to get the maxi mum results possible. His preparations were immense. He received spe cial training in taking field photographs and, due to his own initiative, film. He already knew how to handle the phonograph. Talents notwithstanding, above all he was a practical-minded and modest per son. Not only did he work through von Luschan's 'Anleitung fur ethnographische Beobachtungen und Sammlungen in Afrika und Ozeanien" (Instruction for Ethnographical Observations and a f * 1 /r&gt; i- ni . v&gt;untvnv/iij ni j in iva aixu vyvcaiiiay y a.-» \_11 i i i iu^/y y uul also a much more comprehensive manual, original ly published by Sebald Rudolf Steinmetz, one which rU,,™„„U I J„J — fc&gt; — —111 supplements from scientists of related fields. This questionnaire with its 2,500 questions emphasized the social aspects of culture, based on the conviction that it is specifically the social life of native people :hat will change most rapidly. For this reason, these questions should serve to clarify the different forms :&gt;f human society and their psychological funda menrs. i ne results were planned to rorm a database or further research.

Consequently, rhurnwald was the first one to conduct this partic ilar type of experimental/interdisciplinary survey in he field. Carrying all these insights into the necessities of ;cientific work both in his baggage and in his mind, rhurnwald arrived in Herbertshôhe on New Britain n November 1906. His journey, which was origi 11 1 1 » »* « « icu iy pidiincu lu îasi une y ear, eventually lastea hree. He had to face some severe hardships, "oremost was the negative attitude of the colonists ma administrators towards tne Derlin Museum. People were upset about the Bundesratsbeschluls (Federal Gouvernment's decision) [see Buschmann kk)6I, which reauired all collections acauired bv officials to be sent to Berlin without any compensa tion.

For one thing, because he didn't drink ilcohol at all; he wasn't able to fit easily into the social life. As a result, he had trouble contacting collectors ind prominent officials. He also faced difficulties luring rus tirst year in obtaining the police protec tion he felt he needed for his trips into the bush. No jne would ever have expected that Thurnwald (only i few years later) would be one of the most adven turous among his colleagues, and would be the first white person to reach the headwaters of the Sepik without being defended by colonial troops.

Once in the held, Thurnwald was not very con :erned about sending collections home. He com plained that he always had to spend too much time m packing and shipping the artifacts, yet he paid so ittle attention to this side of his work that he near 1 &gt; 1 « 1 y u\.ivauv.u vuu j_iUOUiail d pictli LU iCHU.

In 1007. iusr as rorlav. if was rliffiriilr o convince potential sponsors to put money into expeditions when there were no visible results to how from the last one. Thurnwald's interest in naterial culture was undoubtedly not very great. In lis opinion, collecting and transporting artifacts prevented him from acquiring more sociological, 6 racihc Arts</page><page sequence="5">linguistic, and psychological information. As he states in his first Buin volume, asking for artifacts disturbs relationships with the Melanesians. It was certainly hard and expensive getting objects from the coastal areas, and just collecting without background information was not Thurnwald's way of working. In addition, he was alone, without the means to employ more people or even an assistant, who could have eased his work load. JNeither had he his own ship, nor a colleague to share his distress. He had next to nothing to offer, no decoration to relieve the Brustschmerzen, (chest pains, see Buschmann p. 56) only von Luschan's questionnaire, which posed even more work for potential and willing donors. While sending mate rial to other colleagues instead of to von Luschan, Thurnwald asked Berlin for more money. Von Luschan reminded him that his journey should bring well documented (up to mythological depth) aiiu aniavuït piwvv-o iiiiu uiv. i_-&gt;i 1111 iiiujvuiuj iiviiu like the ones in Stuttgart for example. This took time and money. Unce 1 hurnwaid eventually acquired the artifacts, they still had to be shipped.

And wood for boxes was very expensive and hard to acquire (Museum fiir Vôlkerkunde zu Leipzig, acquisition files Carl Nauer 1911, 1912). Only one year after he had left Europe, the first shipment of artifacts collected byThurnwald arrived in Berlin, including objects and masks like the ones in Stuttgart, that is to say malagan items. (Une or these New Ireland figures collected by Thurnwald is on display in the ethnological institute in Gôttingen. It is colorful and, apart from some miss ing pieces, in good condition). Being in the field makes one even more sensitive about everything that happens at home, so Thurnwald was quite upset when he learned that von Luschan had complained about his not sending tj:_ !.. ... l:_ f_: J Alf„J about von Luschan reveals more than a protest. Herein lies the beginning of a lifelong antipathy to the ethnological museum in Berlin.

So Thurnwald was very careful not to give false expla nations, as in his opinion Emil Stefan had done con : xt t î— j c 1 — timing HIV. Thurnwald did not make any distinction between the types of artifacts he sent to Berlin.

His second consignment arrived in Berlin in 47 boxes! A few of his shipping lists, however, did include more details than normal. Nevertheless from the very few remaining field notes and from some hints July 2000 57</page><page sequence="6">in his publications, it is obvious he knew much more than he ever published or imparted to the Museum. Objects of religion An excellent example is his unique collection of Iniet-figures (Fie. 2). Several times in 1907 Thurnwald went to Toma in the Vunakokor area, where he collected anthropomorphic and zoomor phic figures made from a soft chalk stone, pumice, clay, or wood. These figures belong to the Iniet secret society, and Thurnwald's collection of 741 pieces today is the biggest in the world. (Figs. 3 and 4) His letters, in which he reports on his time in Toma, reveal that he never regarded them as 'art' in a mod ern European sense, but as a part of religious life. In Toma Thurnwald developed his own mode of questioning. He started to talk with the Tolai peo ple, whose language he had learned since he had arrived in the colony. He told them about Europe, and nature, and played European music; in this way he got their commentaries and reactions. Early in the morning the neonle would wait for him. brinp ing him stone figures in exchange for blankets, nmhr/=»Ilic lontprnc an A l;w TK totelàr (figures and objects) however were only acquired at night. Thurnwald obtained the figures not only from the Tolai themselves, but also from a planter who found some in the ground. Others he obtained from Richard Parkinson. Many of them were already broken or only fragments. Only two years before, the governor had prohibited all big Iniet ceremonies, and the missionaries pressured the Tolai males to abandon the ritual. So Thurnwald was there at the right time. He managed to get a lot or information about the totelar made rrom wood or clay, and about the stone-figures. The totelar, accuiumg lu mm, icpicaciu uic bum bymuui ui uic bush spirits, whereas the stones represent the souls of their personal owners, but all stones belong to the common property of the Iniet-society and were stored together. The stone figures exclusively show edible creatures, including humans. But verses of magic were only made for dangerous animals (Thurnwald 1910:136). For the entertainment of his informants as well as for his research purposes, Thurnwald made _i !_• J: 11 1 „1 o 1* sound archive). Thinking and feeling, he was con vinced, are expressed by the songs. Altogether he was Figure 2. Iniet figure collected by Thurnwald (photo by Harry Hase, Gottingen Museum) able to acquire more than 100 Iniet song texts and tales, attributing the term 'artists' to the singers of the songs, but not to the producers of the figures. For him it was essential to pain insight into the interpretation of the people themselves; in the end his explanations for culture traits were psychologi cal ones. It was no accident that he discussed the matter in depth in his article "Ethno-psychologische ^tuaien an ouaseevoiKern aur aem DismarcK nxcnipei una uen oaiomo-insein ^r,mno-psycno logical Studies about the South-Sea Inhabitants in the Bismarck-Archipelago and the Solomon T _1 J _\ /T1 1 J \ A J ' . _ 1* -LOKX11VJ.OJ y lylj \ 1 11U111YYCUU 1^/1^/. 1 V^-CVJi Ull 1g LU 111111, these stone figures emerged from an attempt to ensure the help and assistance of the dead, and to utilize the power of the deceased on their own behalf or for or against others. "The means for that is the form, in which the power is thought to rest and stay. There is nothing artistic; color and form stay in the DacKgrouna against tne endeavour to Dan tne dead through a magic item." (Translation M.K.; Thurnwald 1913:84,85) As Gerd Koch (1982) con „1..

Group of photos of New Britain Gazelle Penninsula objects belonging to various owners that was shown by Thurnwald to his students state as an art object" (Koch 1982:32). This was already Thurnwald's impression as well, but leaves one question open: would he have packed the stones more thoroughly, if he - and their former owners — had considered them as art? The fact is, some of Thurnwald's 'stones' arrived at Berlin severely dam orro/^ Rut- uro fKof- k/a i 1 f- nf trouble getting the 'stones' with ox carts to Herbertshôhe, breaking the government's cart and ininrincr rhp nypn. whirh were rnn hitr fr&gt;r rhf» vnkf of a rented cart. Also during the rainy season he could not get enough wrapping material. As he showed in his report for the Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie in Tom anrl in hie wnrl nn Frhnn-ncvrhnlncrv in tot2 Thurnwald had amassed an immense amount of knowledge about the figures and their meaning inside theTolai culture. He analyzed these and other objects of material culture in his chapter on Bildhafter Ausdruck (plastic expression).

And in 165 pages and 21 plates he gives his readers the key to deeper understanding of the reli gious and mental life of the Melanesians, quoting their reactions and opinions while analyzing the rorm or oDjects rrom une DismarcK /\rcnipeiago ana the Solomons that were collected by him and others. To conclude: Thurnwald did indeed consider the 'stones' as art. But as already mentioned, not in the modem European sense. And he planned to give fur ther information on material culture in later publi cations. Collecting material culture for display Thurnwald's collections comprized every aspect of life. He knew exactly how things were produced, the origin of colors, and how the niant and other mare rials were treated. He also took photographs of how they were made and collected samples of raw mate rial as artifacts as well. In Buin, after considerable errort, he started his own open-air museum consist ing of models of houses from different parts of the colony, furnished with true indigenous items. t-v i r t r t-» • n t i I cupic 1IUII1 LI1C ICII1ULC cLlCdb UI DU1I1 11UL-K.CQ LU bCC them and according to the caption of a photograph, July 2000 59</page><page sequence="8">Figure 4.

This idea of showing realistic life by means of complete ly furnished model houses, first invented by Artur Hazelius (1833-1901) in Stockholm's Skansen Museum was favored by Thurnwald. He described his ideas on exhibitions in two arti cles in 1911 and 1912. In "Uber Volkerkundemuseen, ihre wissenschaftlichen Bedingungen und Ziele" f"Al—«- 1^ „ .— ditions and their goals") (1912) he stated his convic tion, that people do not visit these museums to see art but to learn something. He recommends dis playing peoples' life in different stages, appearances and manifestations. This type of exhibition was railed "hiolopiral formation" hv his con rem nora ries such as Augustin Kramer. Thurnwald's recommen dations for ethnological museums not only include a department showing acculturation and the effects of colonization, but study collections; working places for the scientists and audio visual perfor mances for the visitors. Thurnwald wanted an eth nological institute at the Berliner Museum to be founded for the research of the intellectual and men tal processes underlying the material expressions.

Dance with club and ornamental shield, Buin, Bougainville (photo by Thurnwald 1908) Results of the first voyage In 1908, Thurnwald decided to settle in Buin, in the south of Bougainville. It was there he recognized the special quality of songs sung by the male islanders. He spent eight months on Bougainville, inter spersed with trips to the British Solomon Islands, where he also met George Camden Wheeler. Wheeler and Thurnwald took the opportunity to discuss their research and vocabularies (see Richard Christian Thurnwald Papers, Yale University Library, Manuscripts and Archives; Australian KTof-mnil Ï IniirornHr TKnrniirol^'p T inmiipHr Dot-»atr.

And volume one provides us with something unexpected: Thurnwald himself was a poet. He was also able to give his interlinear transcriptions a very reauaDie ana poetic rorm. Later, arter a secona stay in Buin after 24 years, he described the song texts and legends from Buin as 'profane literature.' As Don Laycock figured out in the sixties and seven ties, Thurnwald's transcriptions of the words are quite often wrong, but in his narrative account of the content of the songs he gives the real meaning of the texts (Melk-Koch, 1992). It seems strange that 1 hurnwald instantly recognized literature as a form of art, but not the material items of the cul tures, at least not while he was in the field.1 Thurnwald spent 1906 to 1909 mainly in the Bismarck Archioelaeo and the Solomons, commis sioned by and working on behalf of the Royal Ethnological Museum in Berlin. His results in the sociological, linguistic, legal, psychological and eco nomic field were immense. But in his previous pub lications he harl alrearlv revealerl a rrair that makes it difficult for ethnologists working on the region to make use of his results and scientific work: infor mauon is always scattered in a wiae range or articles and most difficult to filter out. This trait persisted with respect to his two field trips to Melanesia. Back home in September 1909 Thurnwald also began to work on an exhibition of his collections, but had to cancel his preparations in favor of anoth July 2000 61</page><page sequence="10">er big collection that had arrived at Berlin. His frus tration and the growing antipathy to Felix von Luschan as well as to Albert Griinwedel, who fol lowed von Luschan as head of the department, and even later with Adolf Eichhorn, led to his total refusal to work in the museum.

In his paper given at the Erste Hauptver sammlung der Internationalen Vereinigung fur Vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft und Volks wirtschaftslehre, 1911 (First General Meeting of the International Association of Comparative Juris prudence and National Economics"), Thurnwald favored the idea of the foundation of ethnological institutes for scientific, ethno-sociological, linguis tic. and nsvc.ho logical studies, an idea that first became reality in Leipzig in 1914. Thurnwald spoke about the necessity of learning from the natives and how to achieve the proper contact with them. He criticized his colleagues who were concerned with "faraway things like arrowheads and bow bindings" instead of the social institutions, the living condi Figure 6. Man from Buin, Bougainville, 1908 (photo by Thurnwald) tions, and the psychic specialities of the actual nations.

[Thurnwald 1914:82, Translation M.K.] Thurnwald spent three more years in New Guinea.

Corning home, Thurnwald was very much con cerned about the fate of the collections from his last trips into the interior that he had to leave in New Guinea and in the United States. Several hundred photographs were still in Australia, some collections stuck probably in Java.

In this respect it is especially tragic Figure 10. Warrior behind shield, Karadjundo, Sepik, 1913 (photo by Thurnwald) that his held notes did not survive. Thurnwald left no assets, except some papers mainly from the thir ties, in the Sterling Memorial Library in Yale, some documents kept in Berkeley, and the already men tioned linguistic papers in Canberra. Circumstances of life were not easy for scientific work on overseas cultures in the following years.

Thurnwald and Melanesian Art In the years following his return from the US, (1917) Thurnwald repeatedly tried to get access to his col Eichhorn refused by insisting that he still owed the museum the second volume of his Buin books. How much Thurnwald was concerned about material culture becomes clear in his lecture manu scripts kept in Yale and in the motives on his glass . 1_ J _1 L !_ 1 /r?! __ _ 1 iiv- uov-u iu oiiwYv lvj 111a oiuuviiio yi igo. j aiiu 4). Interestingly he asked museums in Stuttgart and Munich to get photographs of artifacts collected during the Sepik-Expedition. His lectures in Halle were already dealing with "Mental Life and Art of Primitive People," "Psycho-sociological Basics of Primitive Art," and in the following years he gave lectures on "Advancements of Culture." including dance, music, art and techniques, and the "Independent development and assimilation of cul ture traits." He obviously always discussed and inciuaea material culture. Thurnwald, always concerned with the evolution of society and the human mind from prehistory to modem times, in his 1922 monograph Psychologie des Primitiven Menschen, discussed art as one aspect of human society His attitude was that art is always imbedded in the whole culture and that one needs 1 • 1 1 -I'll LU LcLJvC 111 LU L.UI1MU.CI tlLlUl 1 LUC SUClUlUglL-dl illlU chological perspective when considering primitive art. And thus, Thurnwald, in this attempt to elicit early mankind, used examples drawn from different parts or me woria. primitive men are not alive nowa days, he stated. But societies of people, still living in close contact with nature and in different states of handling their environment can be cited to show the wide scope of human abilities.

September in Zurich (Sixth German Gathering of Sociologists in Zurich) where he was the keynote speaker of the section "Ethnological Sociology." The speakers at the conference were to rank highly in the history of German Sociology, some of them to become famous in the 1960s and 70s. Thurnwald's section had the title: Antange der ivunst, i.e. 1 ne Beginning ot Art." As always, he emphasizes art as coming from a religious context. Already as in his monograph on the psychology of the primitive human, there were no hints about special objects, nor did he make it clear that he recognized some of the artifacts he had collected as art. 66 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="15">Yet, as we have seen, he was not indifferent towards material culture, for him the items were a ueic&amp;baiy ucvicc ni liumau 111c. i iiuuiwaiu, iu juugc from his notes as well as from his publications, would have been able to be "the most modern of all" (as he stated himselr shortly before his death in 1954) [personal communication Dr. Barbara Pischel, Assistant at his institute for social psychology and ethnology in Berlin in the early fifties] both in rec ognizing and elucidating the different aspects of material culture.
