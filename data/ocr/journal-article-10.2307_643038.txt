<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greece &amp; Rome, Vol. xlvi, No. 1, April 1999 SUBJECT REVIEWS (* denotes that a book is specially recommended for school libraries; ** that it is suitable for advanced students only; B that a bibliography is included.) Greek Literature Sharply contrasting ways of writing about Homer are to be found in the first two volumes for consideration here. One, Matthew Clark's B**Out of Line,' offers a densely technical treatment of Homeric enjambment, a subject already much discussed in the secondary literature. Clark deploys a panoply of analytical terminology (including such unfortunate labels as 'orphan runovers') to categorize the structural patterns of various kinds of enjambment. He draws out what he takes to be the workings of oral-formulaic composition, which he prefers to construe in terms of a 'deep structure' model (functioning by underlying associations) rather than the surface phenomena of specific groupings of words. The enterprise is firmly rooted in the Parryist tradition of oral- poetic theory, and is motivated by the desire to show how a posited compositional technique makes certain things possible and 'convenient' for the poet (though Clark at least balks at Parry's equation of 'formulaic' with 'non-significant'). Readers of this sort of analysis are likely to be divided according to their view of the relationship between what one might call, in shorthand, technique (compositional mechanics) and style (the expressive effect of compositional choices). The difference is something like that between physical examination and critical appreciation of a painting. Too much Parryist criticism arguably collapses style into technique, but the ultimate test of close attention to Homeric verse-configurations is the contribution which it makes to deeper under- standing of the poetry: in this respect, Clark's book, while eventually recognizing the need to relate technique to meaning, leaves large questions unanswered. There are numerous errors in the printed Greek, and 'hephthemimeral' is prominently misspelt (xi). In Margalit Finkelberg's B The Birth of Literary Fiction in Ancient Greece2 Homer provides most of the material for an enquiry into concepts of literature. Finkelberg finds in Homer a 'poetics of truth' which rests on belief in inspiration as the transmission of historical information from Muse to poet. She thinks this idea only gradually gave way to a 'poetics of fiction' in which inspiration was replaced by craft (techne, a 'competitor' with nature) and mimesis. Finkelberg finds traces of the allegedly new concept of crafted fiction emerging in the Odyssey, and believes this may be the object of Hesiod's attack at Theogony 27-8; but the poetics of fiction, which ascribes responsibility to poets themselves, was not properly established until the fifth century (especially through Sophistic notions of artistic deception), and then codified in Aristotle's Poetics, a work which has underwritten the idea of fiction in the West ever since. This is a thought-provoking book, much of which involves a close reconstruction of Homeric 'poetics' and its relationship to a larger Homeric model of psychological experience. But that reconstruction is too tied, in my view, to the analysis of explicit statements about poets and inspiration; there is a danger here of reifying elements of an epic 'self-image' which cannot necessarily be translated into a formal poetics. Another</page><page sequence="2">SUBJECT REVIEWS 81 reservation - and this is far-reaching - is that Finkelberg's truth/fiction and inspiration/ craft dichotomies (which, incidentally, ignore comparative Indo-European evidence) lead her ultimately to schematize complex issues, about the power and significance of poetry, that cut across these distinctions: in particular, a concept of 'fiction' does not automatically mean, as Finkelberg seems to suppose, that the standards of poetry are entirely 'immanent' or internal. Despite these doubts about Finkelberg's thesis, and others about some of its details (especially in the treatment of Plato), this is a challenging book which will help to enrich debate about the archaic/classical development of Greek poetics. The first of a sizeable batch of books on Greek tragedy is Victoria Wohl's B**Intimate Commerce,3 which explores the disastrous 'exchange' of women (as brides, gifts, prizes, etc.) in Sophocles' Trachiniae (Deianeira and Iole as Heracles' prizes), Aeschylus's Agamemnon (Iphigeneia, Helen, Cassandra), and Euripides' Alcestis. Such commerce in women helps to define a male social order, but its catastrophic con- sequences in tragedy expose some of the deep-seated tensions within that world. As a feminist critic Wohl is particularly concerned with ways in which these tensions allow glimpses of the (failed) attempts of tragic women to construct their own 'subjectivity', in opposition to their treatment as objects of men's social transactions. At her best Wohl writes sensitively about, e.g., Deianeira's imagery of lost female innocence at Trach. 144 ff. But this is not a book for the theoretically faint-hearted. Wohl writes a sometimes ponderously self-conscious prose, heavily larded with terminology and concepts from Marxism and psychoanalysis. She is also ready to turn dramatic nuances into blunt propositions: the erotic overtones of Iphigenia's sacrifice in Agamemnon become 'not only an incestuous penetration, but also a sort of gang rape' (75). And while Wohl stresses the 'constructed' nature of the male ideology she discerns in tragedy, she never explains why her own interpretative framework, indebted as it is to some highly contentious modern male ideologies, should carry cogency. After a gap of some years (since Ussher's Philoctetes), Aris &amp; Phillips's Sophocles coverage is now extended by Alex Garvie's B*Ajax.4 Garvie exploits the format of the series well, aiming to provide material suitable for students reading the play in either Greek or English. He includes a large number of short notes, many linguistic; but he has a keen eye for literary and dramatic detail and gives extended coverage to major points such as Ajax's putative hybris (lines 127-33, which he plays down, as in his introduction), the 'deception speech' (646-92, which he does regard as deception, but also as an expression of Ajax's hypothetical sense of the attractiveness of a sophrosyne which he cannot live himself), and the staging of the suicide (815-65, where he suggests scene-shifters and the introduction of a screen at 915, improbably in my view, though the problems remain formidable). Together with its decent text and accurate translation, this is a commentary which displays Garvie's fine scholarship and sage judgement to very good effect, even if his view of Ajax's desire for revenge as 'normal', in Greek eyes, is too bland. Every kind of reader should find things here to refine their understanding of the play. One concept which Garvie manages to do without is that of metatheatre, but according to Mark Ringer's BElectra and the Empty Urn5 it lies at the heart of Sophoclean drama. Ringer shows great enthusiasm for the theatrical richness of Sophocles' work, but there are two problems with his approach (apart from some overconfidence about role-distributions between actors, and their impact on Athenian audiences). First, he stretches metatheatre, which supposedly entails theatrical self- reference, too elastically: so, any mention of sight or seeing can evoke theatrical</page><page sequence="3">82 SUBJECT REVIEWS spectatorship; a messenger's use of aggellein is called self-referential; and any sense of contrast or ambiguity (especially involving seeming and being) must supposedly remind us of the duality of theatre itself. The result is that, for example, both Creon in Antigone and Oedipus in O. T. become playwrights/directors within their plays - a fancy idea, but distractingly adventitious. A second, not unrelated, problem is that Ringer writes with journalistic excess, telling us, e.g., that Electra is a play which 'seems to spiral out of control' (212). Metatheatre deserves a serious place in Sophoclean criticism, but it suffers in Ringer's hands from over-ardent application. Two publications on Euripides continue useful series already underway. The second instalment of John Davie's Penguin Classics B*Euripides,6 appearing commendably soon after the first, contains a substantial group of plays, Andromache, Hecabe, Suppliant Women, Electra, and Trojan Women, making this volume extremely good value for students. Some modifications of practice have been introduced since the first volume (see G&amp;R 44 [1997], 87): lyrics are now italicized (aptly reminding readers of shifts in performance- register) and line numbers are properly given in the margins. Davie's statement of his principles as a translator now tempers the aim of linguistic realism with a recognition of tragedy's tendency, even in Euripides, towards stylistic 'grandeur'. The translation has a consistency, an unpretentiousness and, at its best, a neatness which serve well those readers, probably a majority, who prefer the flow of prose to the greater intricacies of verse renderings. It is dependably supported, as before, by Richard Rutherford's introductions and notes. Two of Davie's plays, Suppliant Women and Electra, reappear in the third volume of David Kovacs's Loeb B*Euripides,7 which also contains Heracles. Kovacs's work maintains the solid qualities previously noticed (see G&amp;R 42 [1995], 223 and 43 [1996], 227). Kovacs's only departure from the earlier volumes is in his translation of lyrics in line-to-line correspondence with the Greek (a small concession to poetic form or to the needs of readers struggling with the original?). The translation itself, facing Kovacs's carefully considered Greek text, is accurate and sober. Some prominent misprints apart, this is once again a professional job well done. Euripides bulks largest in James Diggle's new OCT, Tragicorum Graecorum Fragmenta Selecta.s This selection of tragic fragments is not a reference edition and represents a minority of recorded titles for each of the big three (plus a very small choice from other tragedians). It seems intended to supply students with a text of fragments substantial enough to yield some obvious literary or dramatic interest. There is an up-to- date apparatus in each case, some brief (Latin) 'headings', but no further information about the plays and no index of any kind: students will therefore want to turn to the fuller help available in Lloyd-Jones's Loebs of Aeschylus and Sophocles (for the latter see G&amp;R 44 [1997], 86) and in the Aris &amp; Phillips edition of Euripidean fragments (see G&amp;R 43 [1996], 227). Diggle's editorial standards are predictably high, and even specialists using TrGF (whose Euripides volume is still awaited) will want to check his textual treatment of some of the more difficult fragments. A year ago I discussed a new translation of Aristophanes' three 'women plays' by Jeffrey Henderson (see G&amp;R 45 [1998], 88-9). Now we have the first volume (containing Acharnians and Knights) of a new Loeb edition of B*Aristophanes9 by Henderson, replacing the famous but dated versions by B. B. Rogers (with their virtuosic but excessively twee Gilbert &amp; Sullivan- esque mannerisms). Henderson's translation keeps close to the Greek, but successfully manages to indicate something of Aristophanes' linguistic diversity; it has been carried off with admirable crispness. His text is his own - a tidy 'reading version' rather than a</page><page sequence="4">SUBJECT REVIEWS 83 completely fresh edition (and the textual notes are minimal). Henderson's general introduction and short introductions to individual plays have a tendency to take Aristophanes' text at face-value, and to turn hypotheses into historical facts. They give us a familiar, indeed orthodox, view of a rather earnest playwright who used his plays to communicate serious ideas, not least as spokesman for an 'elite' critique of radical democracy. Henderson struggles to square the latter with Aristophanes' theat- rical victories; 'the success of plays like Knights is surprising', 19. (Athenian theatre- audiences, one should remember, found it easy to howl down plays they disliked.) His explanation, that conservative comic poets were powerful voices in the city's debates, will hardly satisfy sceptics. There are also problems with individual statements of Henderson's, e.g., the simply false claim that comedy did not vilify serving generals. Notwithstanding these complaints, Henderson's text and translation make this a highly welcome addition to the Loeb Library. Henderson is also a contributor to a new volume of essays on Greek comedy, B The City as Comedy."' Most of the essays deal with Old Comedy (including an essay by Rosen on the 'feminine' characterization of cities in Eupolis' Poleis), though there is a piece by Nesselrath on Middle Comedy (showing the prevalence of contemporary social/political themes), and a single item on Menander (in which Hofmeister contends that the polis is not as absent from New Comedy as often thought). Most of the contributors are concerned, in one way or another, with Aristophanes' relationship to the very idea of the city - hence the fact that practically half the thirteen chapters concentrate on Birds, a play all about constructing a (comic) city. The collection is characterized by a readiness to ascribe deep socio-political insight to Aristophanes' work (though Malcolm Heath's account of the poet's use of political rhetoric stands out for its more sceptical tone). But to translate Aristophanes' exorbitant language and motifs into the terms of coherent political discourse is often to strip it of precisely the attributes which make it comic in the first place. There is some fresh and lively writing in this book, but also some vacuous slickness; the editor himself can write, e.g., of Aristophanes 'deconstructing the conventional supplementarity implicit in the notion of "figuration"' (107). Critics who take themselves too seriously are not good judges of Aristophanic absurdity. Vincent Rosivach's B When a Young Man falls in Love" studies the sexual liaisons of New Comedy, both Greek and Roman, and asks what kind of culture would choose to be entertained by plays 'whose plots depend upon rape, prostitution and sexual exploitation' (4). His answer, not surprisingly, is a culture permeated by an ideology which privileged male over female; but the book's interest lies in the steps taken to reach this familiar conclusion. Stressing the social, economic, and psychological disparities which mark erotic relationships in the genre, and the ethos of indulgence towards the wealthy young men, during the transitional state between adolescence and marriage, who are typically their beneficiaries, Rosivach makes a case for seeing the implicit ideology and morality of the plays as profoundly 'conservat- ive'. But New Comedy depends on a dialectic between disorder and order, transgression and resolution; and my main reservation about Rosivach's lucid book is that he emphasizes the orderly resolutions, qua reaffirmations of traditional ideology, somewhat at the expense of the tensions and problems which precede and make them necessary. Hellenistic poetry, after Menander at any rate, is represented in this issue by a single but substantial item, Kathryn Gutzwiller's B**Poetic Garlands,12 which studies the emergence of epigram as a fully literary, rather than mainly 'inscriptional', genre in the Hellenistic period. Gutzwiller links this development both to a taste for</page><page sequence="5">84 SUBJECT REVIEWS miniature, intricate forms, and to the spread of socio-cultural fragmentation and rootlessness (a familiar but less than fully convincing hypothesis of a Hellenistic Zeitgeist). Yet Gutzwiller's interest is not just in individual epigrams but also in their 'context' within collections of poetry: as quintessential 'book poetry', she believes, Hellenistic epigrams acquired much of their significance from their positions in poetic collections whose designs (involving a counterpoint between thematic similarity and variety) were later obliterated by the process of anthologization. Thus her many detailed readings of particular poems by the major epigrammatists, from Anyte to Antipater of Sidon (with the fullest attention predictably reserved for Callimachus), cultivate a sensitivity to the various ways in which groups of epigrams may have functioned as more than the sum of their parts. Gutzwiller's ideas about juxtapositions, sequences, and interactions of poems are often inevitably speculative, dealing as they do with the 'debris' of lost collections; but her wide-ranging book offers readers of Hellenistic poetry a fund of interesting suggestions. To finish with, a set of BStudies in Heliodorus,13 comprising nine essays by an international cast, and divided into three broad sections: narrative technique, 'construction of culture' (including a subtle piece by Whitmarsh on Heliodorus' relationship to ideas of Greek identity), and the novel's reception (from Byzantium right up to the world of modern racial politics). All the essays are interesting, and the contributors share a conviction of Heliodorus' deep sophistication as a writer - a sophistication traced through his use of imagery and motifs, his interlocking, over- lapping structures of story-telling, and his echoes and adaptations of earlier Greek literature, not least the Odyssey. The result (regrettably without an index) is a good advertisement for the state of ancient novel criticism, even if it might leave one wondering whether not everything distinctive of Heliodorus' literary imagination can be accounted for in terms of sophistication.

Roman Literature Given the current modishness of Silver and later Latin, it is striking that the majority of books for review in this issue focus mainly or exclusively on Augustan literature. Naturally, changing fashions in criticism and new ways of reading ensure that there are always new things to be said about the most familiar texts; but it is abundantly clear that our endless fascination with the central works of the traditional canon has its pitfalls. Thus, the subject of B Vergil's Aeneid: Augustan Epic and Political Context' is still a controversial one: there ought to be plenty of room for fresh contributions in this area. Yet the majority of the participants in the two conferences on which this volume is based have chosen to take their stand on well-trodden ground. Most take as their starting-point passages which have already been the subject of much discussion, and, contrary to the editor's claim of critical diversity, the approach is overwhelmingly positivist - Don Fowler (155-74, on the opening of the Gates of War in Book 7) and Philip Hardie (243- 70, on the council of Latins in Book 11) are lone voices crying in the wilderness from this point of view, though honourable mention must also be made of Llewelyn Morgan's interesting discussion (175-97) of sacrificial and gladiatorial themes in the Hercules- Cacus episode, and of Richard Thomas's persuasive (though frankly partisan) defence of Turnus (271-302). I suspect that many of the contributions worked well as conference papers designed to provoke discussion and argument; but the published proceedings will tell any reasonably well-read student of Virgilian scholarship little that he or she does not know already. The relationship between literature and politics (in a broad sense) is more imaginatively addressed in Andrew Feldherr's study, BSpectacle and Society in Livy's History.2 F.'s main theme, as his title suggests, is Livy's highly visual presentation of events; F. argues that this is not simply a matter of narrative style, but that the Ab Urbe Condita is intended to affect its audience in a similar way to the actual spectacles and ceremonies which were so prominent a feature of Roman public life. Not all of the arguments advanced in support of this thesis are equally convincing (F. seems to me to be stretching a point, for example, when he argues for 'parallel[s] between the imitation of a historical example and the transmission of divine signs', 105); but there is nevertheless plenty of food for thought here - the discussion in ch. 2 of Livy's handling of the gods and the supernatural is particularly helpful. Thomas Habinek's ** The Politics of Latin Literature: Writing, Identity, and Empire in Ancient Rome3 is again concerned mainly with the Augustans and their immediate predecessors, despite the broader focus implied by the title. H. has interesting things to say about the ways in which power-relations (between Greece and Rome, Rome and Italy, men and women) manifest themselves in Latin literature, though his rather ponderous and sometimes jargon-filled style makes the volume a far from easy read. H.'s central premise is that literature is 'instrumental to the maintenance of aristocratic cultural hegemony' (5); but his selection of texts (no Lucretius; next to</page><page sequence="7">86 SUBJECT REVIEWS nothing on the elegists' creation of an 'alternative' ideology) is arguably tendentious. No one will be surprised to learn that Cicero and Horace shore up traditional Roman values and imperialist ideology in subtle as well as obvious ways; but I remain to be convinced that these tendencies are universal. R. A. Smith's BPoetic Allusion and Poetic Embrace in Ovid and Virgil4 is a book whose whole is rather less than the sum of its parts. S. offers the reader yet another 'new' approach to allusion/intertextuality, based on the hermeneutics of the philosopher and theologian Martin Buber. But it is not clear to me that his claim to 'elevate the text to Thou-status; to treat the text as another, not merely as a thing' (ix) really adds up to very much. The bulk of the book consists of a series of more-or-less discrete readings (in vaguely Contean mode) of sections of the Aeneid and the Metamorphoses; while some of these are quite interesting and successful in themselves, S.'s appeal to Buber seems largely superfluous, acting (so far as I could see) merely as a justification for curiously old-fashioned notions of 'sensitive readership', 'transcendent commonness of the human experience', and so forth. S. explicitly sees himself as a defender of authorial/textual authority against Barthesian notions of the reader's construction of meaning; but while such a defence is arguably overdue, S.'s response is apt to seem merely reactionary. The book is not sufficiently systematic or comprehensive to constitute a really useful study of Virgilian and Ovidian intertextuality; and I frequently found myself frustrated by S.'s failure to push his analysis far enough. Too often, he seems content merely to draw attention to echoes of earlier texts, without fully exploring their significance. Barbara Boyd's B Ovid's Literary Loves: Influence and Innovation in the Amores5 shows something of the same tendency to stop short just as things are getting interesting. The main theme of B.'s book is the complexity of Ovid's relationship with his models - it is inadequate, she suggests, to describe the Amores as parodying Propertius or even the elegiac genre as a whole. But, while she shows persuasively that Ovid frequently combines echoes of Propertius with allusions to Tibullus, Horace, Virgil, and others, she is guilty of some over-simplification herself when she contends that these echoes are little more than accidental results of Ovid's formulaic style of composition. B.'s Ovid is an almost solipsistic figure, more concerned with his own poetic career than with 'comment[ing] on Virgil or Propertius or any other supposed influence' (89). To some extent, this approach works: B.'s fourth chapter, for instance, plausibly reformulates the notion of Ovidian irony by distinguishing a master narrative of poetic development from the subordinate embedded narrative of the poet's affair with Corinna. But one feels the lack of a sufficiently firm theoretical underpinning: B.'s attempt to put the brakes on interpretation fails to convince because she makes no attempt to confront theories of intertextuality which see the relationships between texts as crucial to their meaning. If Boyd is open to criticism for the narrowness of her reading of the Amores, the same cannot be said of Jean-Yves Maleuvre (sic), whose B***Jeux de masques dans l'lgie latine6 might fairly be described as interpretation run riot. Those of us who thought that Roman elegy was primarily about love and sex have, it seems, been labouring under a misapprehension for all these years. In fact, M. informs us, the elegists' depiction of their stormy relationships with Delia, Cynthia, and the rest is a mere front, behind which is encoded a vehement and sustained attack on the 'tyrant', Augustus. The whole genre, indeed the bulk of Augustan literature, is one gigantic roman a clef, in which nothing and no one is what it seems to be. With the air of a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, M. deciphers the code for his bemused readers: Delia is an allegorical figure representing Rome, Cynthia sometimes personifies poetry,</page><page sequence="8">SUBJECT REVIEWS 87 but is also a 'masque' for Virgil (!), and Propertius' Tullus is a chameleon-like figure who represents Cicero in 1.1 and Agrippa in 1.6 (in 1.22, however, Tullus is, curiously enough, Tullus . . .). The speaker of Propertius 1.1 is not Propertius (or even 'Propertius') but - naturally - Gallus. Most startling of all is the unmasking of Amor/ Cupid as a figure for Augustus himself. This delightful fantasy rests upon the slenderest of foundations: the identification between Cupid and Augustus, for example, is 'justified' (42-3) as follows: propaganda directed against Octavian frequently laid emphasis on his youth; Cupid is commonly referred to in elegy as a puer; hence Octavian/Augustus = Cupid. QED. I did find myself wondering from time to time whether I had in fact missed the point entirely, and whether the whole thing might not be intended as a spoof - in which case, one can only admire the author's ingenuity and the consistency with which he maintains his poker-face (his 'masque'?) through 275 closely- printed pages. Back this side of the twilight zone, yet much more compelling and innovative than either Smith or Boyd, is Ellen Oliensis's BHorace and the Rhetoric of Authority.7 0. focuses on what she refers to as Horace's 'face' - not just the face he presents to the world in each of the works (or what would more conventionally be called his persona), but more specifically the strategies by which he saves face in his relations with Maecenas, Augustus, and his wider readership. This approach proves more flexible and nuanced than appeals to the concept of persona generally are: 0. recognizes that there is a two-way traffic between literature and life, and that the poet may simul- taneously present more than one 'face' to different readers of a single poem. She is particularly good on the (often subtle) interplay between gestures of authority and of deference in poems addressed (directly or indirectly) to Maecenas, and on the different 'rhetorics' associated with different kinds of poetry. We can correlate changes in Horace's self-presentation both with the move from one genre to another and with the advance of the poet's literary reputation and social status; but it is an open and probably unanswerable question which of these factors are causes and which effects. 0. writes with elegance and conviction, and - while she is occasionally in danger of getting carried away by her own rhetoric - this is a book which can be read with pleasure as well as profit. Oliensis's sympathetic portrayal of Horace (or 'Horace') is nicely complemented by Shadi Bartsch's Lucan (Bldeology in Cold Blood: a Reading of Lucan's Civil War),s who comes over as a more appealing and far less nihilistic figure than the uniformly gloomy poet of much recent criticism. The first two chapters of B.'s book give a convincing account of the Bellum Civile as a portrait of a world gone awry, in which language and ancestral values have become meaningless; a whole series of characteristic Lucanian traits - from the poet's apparent obsession with the violation of (corporeal and other) boundaries to his pervasive use of paradox and inversion of grammatical subject and object - is shown to reflect the radical erosion of autonomy and the ideological confusion brought about by civil war. But, for B., the poem is 'more than a hopeless wail into the oppressive darkness of the Empire' (93). She goes on in the second half of her study to point out that Lucan's narrator is overtly and increasingly partisan, despite the blatantly 'unadmirable' character of his hero, Pompey, and despite his insistence on the moral bankruptcy of both parties. What is the reader to make of this two-faced narrator? B. offers us a way out of the confusion by invoking Richard Rorty's conception of 'moral irony': Lucan's narrator deliberately flaunts his political commitment in spite of his awareness of the bankruptcy of the contemporary political system and its ideological vocabulary. Thus, the Bellum Civile turns out - refreshingly - to have a positive message,</page><page sequence="9">88 SUBJECT REVIEWS of sorts: one can choose to believe and to continue the struggle for libertas, even when the grounds for belief and the object of struggle have become irredeemably compromised. I conclude with three books of a more traditional character. Wendell Clausen's contribution to the study of Latin poetry has been an important one by any standards, and Style and Tradition: Studies in Honor of Wendell Clausen9 is a fitting tribute. The Festschrift can be rather a curious hybrid creature, but this volume is more coherent than most. The prevailing ethos is squarely philological: most of the contributors deal thoroughly and effectively with specific and well-defined problems (in tenui labor, as one author aptly puts it), though a broader interpretative or theoretical focus is adopted by one or two, notably Alessandro Barchiesi (130-40, on Athena's cult- statue in the Aeneid) and Christina Kraus (264-83, on repetition in Livy). One of the three sections is devoted to Virgil; the remaining essays deal with a variety of poets and prose writers from Lucretius to Ausonius. P. M. Brown's B*Lucretius, De Rerum Natura III11110 is aimed, like its predecessors in the series, primarily at undergraduates. The notes are full and helpful (offering the reader more assistance both with the Latin and with the structure of the argument than Kenney's excellent 'green-and-yellow' commentary [Cambridge, 1971]); the introduction includes a lucid and concise outline of Epicurean physics and ethics, as well as a sensitive discussion of Lucretius' style and poetic technique. The facing translation is very close to the Latin, if at times somewhat prosaic and stilted. The recent upsurge in the translation industry continues apace, with another new version of Apuleius, by E. J. Kenney (B*Apuleius, The Golden Ass or Metamorphoses). " K. has succeeded admirably in his stated aim of 'do[ing] justice to the movement of Apuleius' Latin in idiomatic contemporary English' (xxxiii): his version is both readable and impressively close to the Latin in tone and sense. The introduction is characteristically learned, but also accessible; the edition also includes forty pages of helpful explanatory notes. MONICA R. GALE NOTES 1.

Greek History 'Appalling' is not a word often used to describe Pericles' Funeral Oration - not in print, at any rate - and the legacy of Greece is rarely described as 'pernicious both in its elitist and its militarist aspects'. How refreshing, then, to find both these judgements in Peter Hunt's B**Slaves, Warfare, and Ideology in the Greek Historians' (220), which is full of such unorthodox ideas, though not of such vehement language. The ideology of the title is the notion that the military role of citizens justifies their superior social and political standing, whereas the political and social exclusion of slaves must be matched by their exclusion from military affairs. H. lucidly presents the evidence in Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon for this well-known idea, but parts company with most historians in his treatment of the scarce evidence for slaves who, in defiance of ideology, do play an active role in warfare. It is usual to explain away such material as exceptional or unreliable, but H. puts his finger on the flaw in this approach: what information we have 'has already slipped through the screen of an ancient ideology which would rather not see it. We should not make the mistake of adding a second screen and discounting attested practices on the grounds that they were not consonant with ancient ideologies' (175). His alternative is to give full weight to passing comment, allusions, and significant silences, as well as to the few explicit references. All this adds up to a strong case for believing that the role of slaves in classical Greek warfare was indeed important, at times even decisive, yet ignored or suppressed by our sources. Slaves did fight at Marathon, even if Herodotus chose not to tell us. Helots, not Spartiates, made up the bulk of the Spartan forces at Thermopylae and Plataea. Large numbers of slaves rowed in Athenian and other fleets from Salamis onwards. Slave defection was not just a side-effect of campaigning, as Thucydides would have us believe, but a major, if controversial, tactic deliberately applied by both sides in the Peloponnesian War (53-82, 102-20). The evidence for all these propositions is handled with skill and sensitivity, and brief but effective comparative studies of slaves in Roman, Mamluk, and U.S. Confederate armies show at the very least that H.'s main conclusions are well within the realm of possibility. I find myself pretty much convinced by his thesis, but must confess to having already been among the converted, and indeed to having preached a similar heresy in Anton Powell's The Greek World (1995). Occasionally, H. lets himself off the hook too easily, as when he argues that at Plataea a single rank of Spartan citizens formed a thin scarlet line squashed between seven ranks of helots and countless Persians (26-9), adding that in the first battle of Mantinea, too, the helots may have been 'incorporated into the rear ranks of the Spartan phalanx' (61), without exploring the consequences for military organization and training. Pursuing these and other implications in full, while ultimately necessary, would have made for a much longer and less readable book, and perhaps it is just as well that H. offers us a more accessible treatment: his original and stimulating views on a 'profoundly horrifying' subject (220) deserve a wide audience. Our image of Pericles continues to be drastically revised. In the last</page><page sequence="11">90 SUBJECT REVIEWS issue of G&amp;R, we noted Michael Vickers's theory that the great statesman lost his testicles to the plague, and we can now add Anne Lou Robkin's discovery, reported in two appendices to Anthony Podlecki's B**Perikles and his Circle,2 that his famous Olympian head was not elongated in shape, after all, but 'perfectly round, and perfectly bald' (172, 177). That's right, kick a man when he is down. P.'s book, aimed at undergraduates, is a shortish account of Pericles' life and times, halfway between a biography and a history of Athens, 479-429 B.C. Its tone is neutral and its attitude to evidence sensibly critical - the Peace of Kallias, the Congress Decree, and the Oath of Plataea are all out, and most stories about Pericles' private life are attributed to 'innuendo and inane comic burlesque' (109) - except that at the very end P. caves in under the pressure of having to come up with an assessment of his subject and assures us that 'the portrait of Pericles that leaps out at us not only from Thucydides' pages but from other sources not tinged by prejudice [sic] is of a politician with principles' (155). The special feature of this book is the space devoted to Pericles' associates, with useful sketches of Damon and Anaxagoras (17-34), Lampon, Hippodamos, and Protagoras (88-98), and of course Pheidias and Aspasia (101-17). The idea that these people formed an intellectual and political 'circle' remains rather underdeveloped. I counted a mere two printing errors, and was strangely satisfied to find the U missing from 'gormandize' (90) turning up in 'demagoguic' (19). Everyone, they say, has at least one novel in him, and I would not be surprised if in every Greek historian there is a book on Thucydides struggling to get out. Few, however, will match Gregory Crane, who published his The Blinded Eye only a couple of years ago, and has already produced a second and longer study, B** Thucydides and the Ancient Simplicity.3 This concept of 'ancient simplicity', rather whimsically borrowed from Thucydides' discussion of civil war in Corcyra, is used to describe an attitude to interstate and interpersonal relations based on notional equality and reciprocity, as found in Archaic Greece and fifth-century Sparta. Its opposite is the 'political realist' view of power relations as based on a self- seeking 'calculus', a view associated with Classical Athens. C. argues that Thucydides' Histories explore the contrasting ideologies, highlighting 'the sad fates' of those who stick with traditional values, yet taking 'a dim view' of those who abandon them (6) and trying very hard to formulate 'a thoroughly modern simplicity' (321) by somehow reconstruct- ing 'the old aristocratic world view, but in such a way as to render it impervious to charges of naivete' (55-6). Perhaps C.'s most important point is that 'realism' is not simply a hard-nosed acceptance of the 'truth' but merely one outlook on life among many, which we happen to take for granted, but which would have seemed radical and shocking to most of Thucydides' contemporaries (esp. 36-71). This line of thought is very appealing, and it is therefore all the more regrettable that it is not always set out very effectively. Points are repeated over and over, as are favourite passages such as Thucydides' claim that the power of Agamemnon was based more on fear than on charis (e.g., 145, 150, 164, 174, 303). The use of anthropological concepts and comparative evidence, commendable in itself, is too often strained. I am as keen as the next man on the vocabulary of reciprocity, but it really is stretching to say that the offer of symmachia 'is a classic example of gift-exchange' (109) or that Gelon's military resources could not be translated into Panhellenic leadership because 'spheres of exchange' prevented the conversion (102). The extended comparisons of Thucydides with General Sherman (21-35) and Mark Twain (40, 48) are certainly original and quite fun, but I doubt that I would find them illuminating even if I were American. Most</page><page sequence="12">SUBJECT REVIEWS 91 frustratingly, C. is oddly selective in his discussion. Why analyse in great detail, and very well, the non-realist, prestige-bound motivations of Corinth in its dealings with Corcyra (96-101), without considering motivations in any other conflict? Why base a reconstruction of Archaic interstate relations on one word in one oracle cited by Herodotus (76-85), and not look at a single Archaic treaty? Still, do have a look at this book: the exciting bits make it worth taking the exasperating bits in one's stride. A curious perspective on the international status of Sparta injects an element of danger into Ernst Baltrusch's otherwise safe and solid popular survey B*Sparta: Geschichte, Gesellschaft, Kultur.4 The off-hand references to Spartan thalassoc- racy between 517 and 515 B.C. (43) and to 'mutual respect' for another's 'spheres of influence' between Spartans and Persians until 490 B.C. (49) are perhaps not meant to be taken very seriously, but B. is evidently in deadly earnest about the theory, to which he recently devoted a specialist monograph, that Sparta's hegemony was 'a sort of by- product' of the struggle to control the helots (34). The Peloponnesian League stayed a League because it existed only to serve the Spartans' selfish desire to keep the helots down, whereas the Delian League turned into an Athenian Empire because it served the common good (100-1). Apparently. The rest of the book is not too bad, if more simplistic than it need have been, and it is pretty comprehensive, covering in little more than a hundred small pages everything from the Dorian migration to the adoption of Sparta as a Nazi role model. To my shame, I have yet to get to grips with the concept of 'the gaze' as a subject of historical analysis, so I struggled with Simon Goldhill's chapter on its 'seductions' in Xenophon's Memorabilia. Despite being more at ease with the study of space (as in 'civic and domestic' rather than 'final frontier'), I found much of Sitta von Reden's chapter on Athenian symbolic topography hard going, too. The other papers on 'the nature of sociability and interpersonal transactions' assembled in B**Kosmos5 (1) are thoroughly enjoyable. This collection, remarkably coherent for a volume which has grown out of a seminar series, is brought to you by the wonderful people - give or take a editor - who gave you Nomos long ago (traditional date: 1990). It kicks off with an adventurous paper in which Robin Osborne, from a study of five painted pots spanning three centuries, deduces changes in the way Athenians saw personal relations. That may sound like are recipe for disaster, but it is extremely well done and as convincing as a sweeping theory based on a handful of pictures could ever be. I suspect that the figure on page 29, with a ram's head and clearly in no need of Viagra, is not in fact Artemis, as the caption alleges. Friendship, currently a hot topic, is well served by discussions of the cynical Eudemian Ethics VII.9-10 (Schofield), affection as opposed to instrumentality in personal relations (Foxhall), and the balancing of private and public interests in relations between magistrates and citizens (Rubinstein). The dark side is nicely represented by Peter Rhodes and Stephen Todd tackling personal enmity in the courts, as well as Jim Roy's paper on the population of Piraeus as a perceived 'threat' to Athens. Private religious associations are helpfully surveyed by Ilias Arnaoutoglou, although it is a pity that he makes so little effort to justify his view that the evidence, which is almost wholly Hellenistic, is equally valid for the Classical period, and does not do more to defend what I take to be his main point, that these associations function as 'agents of acculturation' for non-citizens (80). It is particularly good to see the gymnasium and the agora, two key features of Greek social life far less well studied than the symposium, given their due in two excellent chapters. Nick Fisher convincingly argues that, by the Classical period if not earlier, not</page><page sequence="13">92 SUBJECT REVIEWS only the elite but a much wider band of the population of Athens one way or another took part in athletics, and that success in sporting and associated erotic pursuits provided an important avenue of upward social mobility for non-elite youths who were 'beautiful and promising' (or as they say in comedies, 'willingly buggered and anally flexible', 101). Paul Millett shows how 'appearing in the agora offered scope for an element of differentiation' of personal identity and social status (220). The importance of showing off in public, face-to-face interaction rather than in other arenas goes a long way towards explaining why Greek houses were so unostentatious and so emphatically designed for privacy (206-11). I was briefly appalled that Athens' councillors were 'seated on the slops above the square' (until I spotted the typo, 218) and I remain enthralled at the thought of a work which, if only it survived, would at a stroke answer all those questions about the relevance of Classics to the modern world: Douris of Samos' The Art of Shopping (222).

Pp. xv + 268, with 7 illustrations. ?40.00. Roman History We begin with two works on Livy. Mary Jaeger's B**Livy's Written Rome1 is essentially a study of selected episodes in the Ab Urbe Condita: the battle in the Forum over the Sabine women, the story of Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, an episode of the Second Punic War, and the trials of the Scipios. In the author's own words (12) it examines those places where 'the narrative maps the plot of a story onto the Roman landscape' or 'Livy's use of the Roman world ... as one of his organising devices' (7). This, to quote the author again (7), shows 'his sophistication as both artist and historian'. Arguably it also shows something else: the almost cinematic quality of some of Livy's writing. Jaeger's close and sympathetic analyses have, for me at any rate, brought out clearly this particular aspect of Livy's style. Let us take, as an example, Jaeger's analysis of the battle in the Forum. From her discussion it emerges that what we might term the set, i.e., the Forum itself, is designed with great care, the battle itself is orchestrated very skilfully, and the whole is presented for the viewing of the reader/viewer from a number of different angles. At one point (169) Jaeger speaks of how Livy has created a 'tableau vivant'. In my opinion she could have gone a little further and claimed him as a film director manque. In Greece &amp; Rome 45 (1998), 98 I noted and welcomed the appearance of the first volume of S. P. Oakley's great commentary on Books VI-X of</page><page sequence="14">SUBJECT REVIEWS 93 Livy. It is pleasant now to record the appearance of B**A Commentary on Livy Books VI-X, Volume II: Books VII and VII.2 As before, this is a massive work which runs to some 866 pages and, as before, is characterized by its immense learning and its fullness of treatment. The commentary ranges over historical, literary, linguistic, and textual matters. It also has to be said, however, that, yet again, the awesome size and scope of the work is matched by its awesome price. This will probably mean that it is beyond the reach of the pocket of the individual scholar but it must surely find a place on the library shelf of any institution where there is a serious interest in Latin literature or Roman history. A third volume which will complete the work is awaited. I recently remarked (Greece &amp; Rome 45 [1998], 250) that there seemed to be no end to the making of books about the Second Punic War and sure enough yet another comes along. This latest addition to the list is called simply B*Hannibal. It is by Serge Lancel.3 Translated from the French it is, as the title would suggest, a biography of the great Carthaginian which combines readability with solid scholarship. Lancel's particular strength is his close acquaintance with things Carthaginian. He has excavated there and is the author of a history of the city which is also available in English. This competence means that, in so far as the source material will allow it, he is able to write from a sympathetic Punic perspective. In the end though, for me anyway, Hannibal remains a somewhat elusive figure although there is a certain compensation in the form of the final chapter which has something to say on the subject of his posthumous influence and reputation. One grumble must be added: there is no map of Spain which does not help when we try to follow what the protagonists got up to there. Although he occasionally reflects on the nature of history (e.g., 13, 125-6) I don't really think there is much for the historian in John Henderson's B**Fighting for Rome,4 a work which examines passages of Appian, Caesar, Horace, Lucan, Statius, Tacitus, and Livy which have civil war as their theme. The chapter on Caesar, for instance, seems to be saying that Caesar's writings present him in a good light and his enemies in a bad, which can hardly count as a revelation. I say 'seems' because Henderson's ugly, mannered prose is very often hard to understand. He can unblushingly declare (186), 'Lucan's difficult language is strange' while he himself is dark to the point of obscurity. It may very well be that these close readings may have something to offer to the literary critic who wishes to persevere with them but he had better be prepared to tackle passages like the following (180) on Lucan 2.221-33: 'War can't die - it is Death. The death caused by Sulla, the death of Sulla. The "success" (exitus) of Sulla Felix, his final "solution" (exitus). In the word, more than Lucanian "deathsting". The permanent "Sullution" will be: "no Solution", permanently.' B*Res Publica Conquassata edited by James K. Finn and Frank J. Groten, Jr.5 is not, in essence, a work of historical scholarship either but rather a Latin reader whose passages have been grouped around an historical theme. That theme is Rome's second civil war, and the texts chosen largely come from Cicero's correspondence but these are interspersed with selections from Caesar and there is also one passage from Suetonius. From the chronological viewpoint the selection starts with a letter of August 50 from Caelius Rufus to Cicero dealing with the state of con- temporary Rome and ends with one from Gaius Matius, in 44, reflecting upon the murder of Caesar. As the editors declare (9), 'it has thus been designed as a self- contained edition for students of intermediate and advanced Latin.' Translating this into practical terms, I should say that any student who has worked through Wheelock or its equivalent should be ready for this selection and should benefit from it. This is</page><page sequence="15">94 SUBJECT REVIEWS particularly so because of the generous help offered by the editors both with the historical background and the language. The background is covered in an introduction and there is, in addition, a chronological table, a list of personal names, and a glossary of key terms. The commentary also deals with historical matters but what is noteworthy is the amount of space given to the kind of grammatical problems it is envisaged the student would meet. There is too an extensive Latin-English vocabulary. In the introduction (1) to his B*Aspects of Roman History, AD 14-1176 Richard Alston tells us what his aim is, namely, to provide an introduction to the period A.D. 14-117 for those with little or no experience of ancient history. As he says, 'it is intended to provide a basic chronological framework for study of the main events of the period and to give brief introductory outlines of the major issues.' In doing this the work naturally divides into two parts. Alston first discusses the sources and the Augustan settlement. He then follows this initial chapter with eight more covering the emperors between Tiberius and Trajan. Then come separate chapters on society, the economy, administration, the army, women, the provinces, and religion. A good deal of information is packed into these pages and the exposition is clear and concise. Inevitably there will be comparisons with the recent (Greece &amp; Rome 45 [1998], 98) book, The Roman World 44 BC-AD 180 by Martin Goodman which covers some of the same ground. Of the two Alston is probably marginally the more accessible. It is to him then that sixth-formers and undergraduates with little prior knowledge of Roman history are likely to turn and, it may be said, they should come away enlightened. The first six papers in T. P. Wiseman's **Roman Drama and Roman History' provide this collection of essays with its title. They are grouped around the same theme, expounding the thesis, which goes back at least as far as Ranke in the last century, that Roman drama may have had a profound effect on Roman historical writing. Some of the material which for us today survives in the latter may ultimately derive from the former. Wiseman wears his learning lightly, is consistently ingenious in method and lucid in exposition. Personally I find him persua- sive on this thesis. A seventh essay attempts to explain Anna Perenna who is to be found in Ovid's Fasti. Then comes another block of three which can be grouped together as an examination of the capacity of the Roman nobility for self-advertisement. One of these, that which deals with the Minucii, has already been noticed in this journal (Greece &amp; Rome 44 [1997], 237) when it appeared as part of a commemorative volume for T. R. S. Broughton. The last two essays deal with modern historians. One considers the late output of Ronald Syme and is an attempt to get behind the difficulty (or obscurity) of that later work. I found altogether more interesting the other which deals with the now almost forgotten figure of E. S. Beesly who, in the last century, held chairs of Latin and History in the University of London. As portrayed by Wiseman he emerges as a man of left-wing views who produced some work on the Late Roman republic which revealed a scholar of independent judgement. That portrayal is warm and sympathetic and admirably brings its subject to life, placing him in the social and political context of his day. It should encourage some of us to seek out and read for ourselves what Beesly had to say about such people as the Gracchi, Cicero, and Catiline.

Pp. xii + 228, with 9 figures. Paper ?13.99. Archaeology and Art The archaeological illumination the Greek 'Dark Age' proceeds with blazing ardour. Soon the epochal term itself will be a mockery. Gail Hoffman's B**Imports and Immigrants' pokes a torch in the direction of Crete in the period 1100 to 700 B.C. and clarifies the dynamic of Orientalizing on the island. There is not too much rhetoric about multi-cultural contacts and historical revisionism; instead we are presented with a decidedly positivist approach, with a catalogue of tangible evidence at the book's core. Of course questions remain which are necessarily matters of speculation. How can we distinguish between imports to Crete and locally-produced imitations? Were artefacts - whether pottery, faience, metalware or ivories - actually imported from Near Eastern sources, or commissioned and made in Crete: that is, the result of migrant skills? Since we know artists to have been generically footloose around the Mediterranean in the historic period, it is tempting to assume that similar peripatetics were abroad in prehistory. If Syrian sculptors could travel all the way to Etruria circa 700 B.C. (as we suspect), then - to put it coarsely - Crete was a doddle by comparison. Hoffman does not shy from admitting the difficulty of deciding which had more likely mobility, the craftsman or his products. But given that her discussion focuses so much upon objects, it seems awkward for illustrations to be so small-scale, and separated from the main text. Publishers have budgets to observe: yet here one yearns for the sort of handsome format that came with Brock's Fortetsa or suchlike. 'The empires of Assyria and Egypt ignored the Aegean coasts, but Greeks were soon to visit foreign shores . . and receive the ships of easterners.' John Boardman takes up this theme in introducing his latest handbook, B*Early Greek Vase Painting.2 Boardman's account confirms Hoffman's picture: it seems that not only should we start thinking of the Dark Age as sunny, but also rid ourselves of the notion that 'Orientalizing' especially characterizes the eighth and seventh centuries in Greek history. It is much older than that. Although Greek artists arguably 'reinvented' a figurative style of their own from c.750 B.C. onwards, the senior styles of the Near East were always a point of reference - if only to remind Greek artists of what they ought not to be doing. As with all of the author's handbooks in this series,</page><page sequence="17">96 SUBJECT REVIEWS the assemblage of illustrations is unparalleled, and makes the book a necessity. But beware the equally customary descent into brisk over-simplification. '. .. the vase scenes were no more designed to illustrate Homer than was the alphabet to write him down', we are assured. I suppose there is a sophisticated ambivalence to that remark, but it will escape those readers unaware that some modern scholars (notably Barry Powell) do indeed argue that the Greek alphabet was devised for the transcription of Homeric epic. Disputes about the extent of Homer's influence upon early scenes of narrative on Greek vases have become extraordinarily academic of late: Boardman's unqualified assertions about the 'non-specific' and unheroic nature of Geometric battle-scenes, compounded by some archly donnish remarks ('There seems to have been a universal interest in fowl'), indicate that he regards the matter as settled. This reviewer begs to differ. Proof that nothing is simple about early Greek art is plentifully provided by the opening essays in Nikolaus Himmelmann's collection, **Reading Greek Art.3 'Archaic Greek art does not want to admit any limits; it believes it cannot do enough for the viewer and wants to narrate everything at once' - a typical Himmelmann gem, in a volume doubtless to be plundered by those of us taxed each year with finding ripe quotes suitable for the appendage, 'Disscuss'. It must be the ultimate accolade in scholarship, to have one's scattered articles not only collected and reprinted, but translated too. It is also an admission that even postgraduate students of Classical Archaeology nowadays are unlikely to know German: whereas fifty years ago research in the field would have been unthinkable without mastery of the language. (Though it is true that Himmelmann's vernacular is rather poetic.) There are both variety and coherence in this volume: the only regret (from a pedagogical point of view) is that no space could be found for Himmelmann's 1990 article on 'ideal nudity' in Greek art. Himmelmann's analysis of meaning in ancient art commands attention because it is analysis that matches theoretical meditation with substantial familiarity with the objets d'art themselves. The expectation is still upon German research students to prove themselves in the latter respect before they even contemplate the former, as demonstrated by Susanne Moraw's monograph, B**Die Miinade in der attischen Vasenmalerei des 6. und 5. Jahrhunderts v. Chr.4 'Monograph' is an understatement: this is more than a diligent inventory of every maenad tossing her hair on an Athenian vase. Moraw not only begins from philological first principles (the meanings and metaphorical associations of paLvdS, 3dcKX1, and so on), but also fully integrates the iconographical evidence of 'maenadism' to what we know about its actual practice in Athenian society. Not for beginners, certainly, but likely to be an essential work of reference for anyone trying to fathom the social 'background noise' to Euripides' Bacchae. Another nugget from Himmelmann. 'The her- meneutic directive to interpret from context is far more ambiguous than it may at first seem to be ... context as a concept does refer to something concrete and definable, but it is otherwise a fluid quantity.' This from his essay on the pitfalls of identifying the scenes on a Roman sarcophagus. Perhaps it is because the so-called 'minor arts' of Rome are (apparently) so definable in terms of context that they are receiving fresh attention. This seems the case with Stuart Fleming's B*Roman Glass:5 a compact but outstanding introduction to a set of objects too easily passed over when shown in museum cabinets. In five vignettes, beginning with 'The Roman Day', Fleming describes 'how glass fitted into Roman society at the personal level - how, where and when it was used within the rhythm of everyday life; indeed, because of the Roman practice of providing foodstuffs and offerings to their deceased, even unto death.' The specimens of glass (all from the</page><page sequence="18">SUBJECT REVIEWS 97 collections of the University of Pennsylvania) thus set off some vigorous excursions into Roman social history, in which no knowledge is taken for granted. The appearance of an unguentarium, therefore, is cue for Catullan verses, contemporary images of farmers harvesting frankincense, pictures of wild Mediterranean lavender, and so on. Eloquently presented, this booklet amply demonstrates that interactive computer technology is by no means the sole key to making museum displays 'come alive': enthusiasm, plus a decent graphic designer, is quite enough to uphold the virtues of the printed page. Mosaics have also been accorded a new survey. As Roger Ling points out at the beginning of his B*Ancient Mosaics,6 they are, when considered as an art-form, quite bizarre. Obviously time-consuming and fiddly, what was the point of making a mosaic when its overall effect was intended to simulate the colour gradations of a painting? (To reply that a mosaic was more durable to walk upon is hardly adequate when so many mosaics were destined to decorate vaults and walls.) But as Ling goes on to demonstrate, the way in which mosaicists exploited their craft encouraged a divergence from the essentially illusionistic ambitions of most Roman wall-painting. Anticipating the chromatic interests of the pointilliste Impressionist Seurat, the skilled maker of mosaics - distinguished as a musearius if he worked on walls or vaults, paid less as a tessellarius if his labours were going to be trodden on - was highly aware of the effect of distance upon perception. This is not to say that wall-painters neglected architec- tonics: but the very degree of painstaking installation required of a mosaic ensured that particular consideration went into its spatial relationship with the everyday functions of the building which it embellished. Also, once laid out, a mosaic was not capriciously replaced: which explains why, for example, the villa-owners of Roman Cyprus who converted to Christianity but inherited images of Dionysos on their floors were content simply to alter a few labels within the multiple tesserae. It was at any rate a craft for which demand endured well into the Byzantine world. B**Patron and Pavements in Late Antiquity,7 edited by Signe Isager and Birte Poulsen, explores themes and questions raised by the excavation of a villa at Halikarnassos, dated to the second half of the fifth century A.D., whose floors were richly covered in mosaics. Some were raised during Charles Newton's excavations in the last century, including a tondo personification of the tyche of Haikarnassos; others have come to light through more extensive recent Danish campaigns. The papers collected here put the finds in a general Late Antique setting across Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy; and the illustrations are enough to indicate that no fall-off in quality occurred in this period. In the related sphere of opus sectile work, in fact, more virtuosi seem in evidence than ever before - and their work at Rome may now be better appreciated in a new display at the renovated Palazzo Massimo museum. Finally - almost de rigeur - to Pompeii. 'Our views of ancient Pompeii are driven by two hoped-for perfections. The first is that of a perfect recapture of a segment of ancient Rome, where the past can be understood and recreated with a clarity and completeness not found elsewhere in the messy record of Roman antiquity. The second is that of the perfect archaeological site, where human action was frozen at a sudden moment in past time.' With these words Stephen Dyson explains why books on Pompeii must continue to appear - especially since excavation at the site is far from over. And *Sequence and Space in Pompeii,8 edited by Sara Bon and Rick Jones, gives us much more than re-interpretation of old data. Dyson's comments close a set of conference proceedings that are unusually worthy of publication. Here we have, for example, Paolo Carafa's bold proposition that we should look to the Samnites, not the</page><page sequence="19">98 SUBJECT REVIEWS Etruscans, for influence upon the formation of pre-Roman Pompeii; and Eleanor Leach's articulate exposition of 'the vocabulary of the Roman house'. I could wish that the study of private (actually not so private?) toilets at Pompeii had not fallen to a severely earnest Dutch scholar ('This article has gone into the appearance and operation of toilets at Pompeii' - what cruel editors). But even where it has already been overtaken by new discoveries - Carafa's Samnite Pompeii is more hypothetical now than it was last year - this volume holds quite enough to justify Stephen Dyson's perceptive declaration that 'every year we know more and also know less about Pompeii'.

Philosophy As recently as a couple of decades ago ancient moral philosophy was of little interest to modern philosophers; they wanted to talk about right actions, whereas the ancients were more interested in character and the good life. That is no longer true, and the ideas of ancient moral philosophers are again moving to a central position in philosophy, so the publication of B**Ethics' edited by Stephen Everson, the fourth volume in the series Companions to Ancient Thought is especially timely. The series does not aim to give an exhaustive coverage of each topic, but rather to pick out current issues under discussion. After a useful general introduction by Everson himself, Charles H. Kahn discusses ethics before Plato, with particular reference to happiness and justice; C. C. W. Taylor follows this with a description of the development of Plato's attempts to show that morality is natural rather than conventional, by linking it to his view of the human personality. Next come two chapters on Aristotle, the first by Stephen Everson attempting to rehabilitate the concept of happiness found in the Nicomachean Ethics, and the second by John McDowell mostly on purposive behaviour. The rest of the book is on Hellenistic philosophy. David Sedley shows that the methodology Epicurus used in ethics is essentially parallel to the one he uses in physics; T. H. Irwin defends the Stoics from the charge of inhumanity; Julia Annas discusses the ethics of the Sceptics; and Susan</page><page sequence="20">SUBJECT REVIEWS 99 Sauve Meyer describes the development of concepts of moral responsibility. Though there is no doubt of the quality of the individual chapters, I do, however, have some reservations about the work as a whole. The volume seems less focused than the others in the series, and, of the contributors, Kahn, Sedley, and Everson are perhaps more aware than the others of the aim stated in the blurb, to be an 'accessible introduction'. Several of the contributions have been previously published elsewhere. Let us hope that this is not a trend, and that the next volume in the series does not turn out to be just another collection of randomly chosen articles. **Method in Ancient Philosophy,2 edited by Jyl Gentzler, is a collection of previously unpublished essays (many of them originally papers given at a conference in 1994) on the question of ancient views on what methods are appropriate in each field of enquiry; it must, however, be admitted that some contributors interpret the theme in a very liberal sense. Patricia Curd argues that Parmenides is a transitional figure in the movement from assertion to argument; T. H. Irwin describes the development of Plato's strategies of argument; both Ian Mueller and Robert Bolton take as their starting point Vlastos's article 'Reason and Causes in the Phaedo' and go on to discuss what Plato meant by causes; A. A. Long asks why Plato stopped using Socrates as the principal figure in his dialogues; Gail Fine writes on Plato's representation of Protagoras' views in the Theaetetus; Constance C. Meinwald deals with the Philebus and Lesley Brown with the Sophist. There are articles on Aristotle by Gisela Striker, C. D. C. Reeve, Charlotte Witt, Richard Kraut, and Sarah Broadie. James Allen writes on Philodemus' De Signis, and the collection ends with a fascinating comparison by G. E. R. Lloyd of the methodology of Greek and Chinese mathemati- cians and medical writers. One thing to be said in favour of the fifteenth volume of **Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy,3 edited by C. C. W. Taylor, is that it has no pretensions to be anything other than a random selection of articles. There are 6 straightforward articles (Daniel W. Graham argues that Heraclitus was neither an interesting but inconsistent philosopher who argued that everything is in constant flux, nor a consistent but dull philosopher who didn't, but claims instead that he was a revolutionary philosopher who can be credited with penetrating criticisms of his Ionian predecessors; Jane M. Day discusses the theory of perception in Theaetetus 152-83; Istvfan Bodnar writes on Aristotle's movers; Jiyuan Yu deals with hylomorphism in Metaphysics 7, 8, and 9; Lindsay Ludson examines the sections supposedly on economics in Nicomachean Ethics 5; and Dirk Baltzly takes issue with Gale Fine over Aristotle's interpretation of Plato) and the rest of the volume is taken up with 3 review articles (Tad Brennan on R. Patterson's Aristotle's Modal Logic; David Charles on The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle; and Dirk Obrink on Giovanni Indelli and Voula Tsouna-McKirahan's edition of and commentary on Philodemus' On Choices and Avoidances). To turn at last to some real books, in B**The Legacy of Parmenides 4 Patricia Curd argues against the usual view that Parmenides' monism was 'numerical monism', that is, that he claimed that only one thing could exist. The problem with this view is that the response of his successors, like Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus, in asserting the existence of many types of being, just does not meet Parmenides' arguments at all. So had they misunderstood him (in which case they are poor philosophers)? Or had they simply decided to ignore him (in which case Parmenides is an irrelevance in the history of ideas)? She argues that Parmenides' monism was not 'numerical' but 'predicational', and that he was claiming not that only one thing existed, but that each thing could be only one thing. The virtue of this view is</page><page sequence="21">100 SUBJECT REVIEWS that it immediately makes it possible to see how the systems of the pluralists and atomists were sensible responses to his arguments, and it places him more firmly as part of the development of ancient physics, rather than as a grand but incomprehensible figure on the sidelines. The general consensus on Xenophon's picture of Socrates is that it is a string of conventional platitudes composed by a man who did not really know much about Socrates, and failed to understand the little that he did know. Vivienne J. Gray's B** The Framing of Socratess does not attempt to make a philosopher out of Xenophon (though Gray does point out that the modern dim view of him was by no means shared by ancient commentators, who regarded him as a notable philosopher and writer), but instead asks why Xenophon chose to portray Socrates as he does. She concludes that the Memorabilia is a carefully composed and accomplished literary work, combining the forms of 'rhetoricised biography' and 'wisdom literature'. One of the problems of Plato's Crito is the discrepancy between the apparent claim of the Laws in their speech to what appears to be absolute and unconditional obedience, and the rejection of uncritical obedience to anything at all other than philosophy, which is represented as being characteristic of Socrates elsewhere. In B**Socrates Dissatisfied6 Rosslyn Weiss tries to solve this problem by arguing that the speech of the Laws does not (as most of us have assumed) represent Socrates' own views. The Socratic position is, she claims, stated in Crito 46b1-50a5, and is broadly consistent with the philosophical views Plato attributes to Socrates elsewhere in the early dialogues. It is only when this fails to convince Crito that Socrates would be wrong to escape that the Laws and their argument are brought in. Crito, she suggests, is not represented as one of Socrates' philosophical followers (in the Phaedo he takes no part in the discussion, and is concerned entirely with the practical aspects of Socrates' execution), but is rather a representative of conventional morality, and is not portrayed in a flattering light. We are expected to contrast a philosophical argument with coercive rhetoric; the rhetorical approach at least prevents Crito from acting in a way which is wrong, but it is a poor substitute for philosophy. The latest philosophical volume in the Aris &amp; Phillips series of texts with facing translations is B*Plato, Apology of Socrates,7 edited by Michael C. Stokes. This is an especially useful addition to the series, and gives full credit to both the philosophical and the literary aspects of the work. Those who are familiar with Stokes's other publications will not expect him to eschew controversial issues, but he always handles them fairly, keeping the reader informed of all sides of the argument. The commentary contains frequent excursuses on philosophical issues,,and detailed expositions of the literary conventions which shape the work. The text benefits from the extensive work done recently in preparing the new Oxford Classical Texts edition. Daryl H. Rice's B*A Guide to Plato's Republics is a very unusual book in that it is an attempt not so much to say anything substantial about the Republic (though it does) as to convince a potentially recalcitrant reader that the work is worth bothering with at all. It is clearly designed as an introductory book for students, and I suspect has grown from a great deal of painfully acquired experience. The result is superb. It is an informal book, sometimes even chatty, but never other than rigorous and challenging. Its priority is to show why the problems Plato deals with are problems which need to be dealt with, and why he handles them as he does (there is a substantial section on the sociology of knowledge). His treatment of the theory of forms is a virtuoso piece (and he even puts up a spirited defence of Plato's criticism of democracy). This is not the sort of book which might be recommended to a student as part of the preparation for writing an</page><page sequence="22">SUBJECT REVIEWS 101 essay, but as a stimulus to classroom discussion it is incomparable, and deserves to be widely used. I would be very surprised to discover that the Statesman was anyone's favourite Platonic dialogue, and most have found it very tedious, but in B**Method and Politics in Plato's 'Statesman"9 M. S. Lane does for it what can be done, presenting it as an exploration of the links between philosophical method and political theory. The book originated as a doctoral dissertation, but is mercifully free from the usual rebarbative features of this genre, and is actually a good read. Indeed, the only serious criticism I have to make of it is Lane's bizarre belief that shepherd's pie (as opposed to cottage pie) can be made with meat other than lamb or mutton (40). What can they be teaching them at Cambridge these days? Jaroslav Pelikan's Thomas Spencer Jerome Lectures, delivered at the University of Michigan and the American Academy in Rome in 1996, and now published as B What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'o are really about the reception of Plato's ideas by early Christian theologians. He stresses the importance of the influence of the Timaeus in stimulating the formation of a distinctively Christian cosmology, and in setting the agenda for the way the creation accounts in Genesis were approached. Perhaps his account of ancient philosophy is a little more simply schematic than it need be. For example, though the Timaeus was probably written in Athens by an Athenian citizen, does that really make it part of a specially Athenian kind of philosophy? Two translations of dialogues of Plato, BPlato's Sophist, or The Professor of Wisdom" by Eva Brann, Peter Kalkavage, and Eric Salem, and BPlato's Parmenides12 by Albert Keith Whitaker, deserve a welcome. The clear and accurate translations have helpful introductions and useful, though brief, notes. The most attractive feature of these volumes, however, is the glossary of Greek terms, with cross-references to the text, which will give even a beginner a good chance of coping with these difficult dialogues. Coming now to Aristotle, we begin with T. K. Johansen's B**Aristotle on the Sense-Organs,13 perhaps the first extended discus- sion of how Aristotle thinks the sense-organs work. Johansen looks at Aristotle's views of why we have sense-organs, and what their function in perception is, and argues that though perception may produce material effects in the perceiver, this is not, in Aristotle's view, what constitutes perception. The remaining three books on Aristotle this year are all on the Politics, which is now again being taken seriously as philosophy, rather than as a quarry for historians. The criticisms Aristotle makes of Plato's Republic in Politics Book 2 have usually been thought of as either ignorant or unfair, and hence neglected. Robert Mayhew, in BAristotle's Criticism of Plato's Republic,14 argues that we need to read these criticisms not primarily as commentary on Plato, but as saying something about Aristotle's own philosophy. What Aristotle really wants to talk about is not where Plato is wrong, but themes like the unity of the city and the relationship between the community and the individual. This is a wide-ranging book with important things to say. The sections of the Politics in which Aristotle describes his own picture of the best kind of political system have been perhaps the most neglected in the whole book, and for that reason Richard Kraut's translation and commentary in the Clarendon Aristotle series, BAristotle Politics Books VII and VIII' is especially welcome. Kraut does not claim more for these books than they can sustain, but his detailed commentary shows that there are problems to be solved here, and that they do throw light on Aristotle's philosophy as a whole. Finally, we have Peter L. Phillips Simpson's massive BA Philosophical Commentary on the Politics of Aristotle.16 Simpson's approach is consciously conservative. He rejects the views of those who</page><page sequence="23">102 SUBJECT REVIEWS believe that the Politics lacks unity. He is unsympathetic to the idea that the work needs to be read in its historical context. He is uninterested in rhetorical readings of the work, and proclaims that his commentary will be purely philosophical. He tells us that his model is the commentaries of Thomas Aquinas. This then is best thought of as a contribution to a continuing argument than an attempt at a definitive commentary. It is stimulating, and has a lot to say. The revival of interest in Cicero as a philosopher continues with the publication in the series Oxford World's Classics of Niall Rudd's new translation B*Cicero: The Republic and The Laws.17 The translation is, as you would expect, clear, accurate, and readable, and the introduction and notes (written jointly with Jonathan Powell) give just the information a beginner will need to get the most out of Cicero's works. D. L. Blank's translation and commentary B**Sextus Empiri- cus: Against the Grammarians1s for the first time makes accessible to non-specialists one of the oddest philosophical works of antiquity. It is part of Sextus Empiricus' attack on liberal studies in general, and to be honest tells us more about ancient grammarians than ancient philosophers (though regular readers of newspaper correspondence columns will find the argument between those who believed that language is governed by unchanging rules, and those who thought usage is the only guide, intriguingly familiar). Blank pays special attention to the supposed Epicurean sources from which Sextus drew some of his criticisms of 'experts' on language. The book is both scholarly and authoritative, and yet manages to be readable and lively. I have to confess that Marcus Aurelius is probably the philosophical writer for whom I feel least sympathy; no doubt he had his problems, but to my mind his self-indulgent gloom is the sort of thing which gives philosophy a bad name. Nevertheless, he is an important figure, certainly in the modern perception of the ancient world, so a new translation by Robin Hard, BMarcus Aurelius, Meditations,1" with a very useful brief introduction and notes by Christopher Gill, has to be welcomed. Hard does his best with the translation, but I have to say that I still found it a profoundly depressing document. The inclusion of an essay on Marcus Aurelius by Matthew Arnold helpfully points the reader in the direction of the real significance of the work, as one of the inspirations of the classical ideal in the modern world. By coincidence, The Inner Citadel,20 a new translation of Pierre Hadot's French work on Marcus Aurelius published in 1992, has also appeared this year. Hadot discusses the odd nature of the Meditations and concludes that, although it is very much in the form of hypomnemata (a sort of literary and philosophical scrapbook, of which other examples are attested), it is actually a systematic Stoic spiritual exercise. He goes to discuss the content of the Meditations within its philosophical and social framework. This is a much less depressing book than the Meditations itself, and part of the reason for this is that Hadot spends quite a lot of time discussing one of the most important philosophical influences on Marcus Aurelius, the ex-slave and charismatic teacher Epictetus, who is as far from depressing as it is possible to get. Epi- ctetus must be the most underestimated and under-studied of all classical authors. It is hard to see why this should be so. He was influential in his own day, and indeed later; he moved in circles which were at the heart of the Roman governing elite; he writes in an exciting and attractive style; and he has interesting and important things to say. Admittedly his Discourses are unsystematic and even chatty, and not at all portentous and serious-minded as we imagine real philosophy should be, but they do give us a unique sense of a real teacher haranguing his students, and it is very surprising that he is not more read. All the more reason, then, to welcome Epictetus, Discourses Book 121 in the</page><page sequence="24">SUBJECT REVIEWS 103 Clarendon Later Ancient Philosophers series, translated by Robert Dobbin, with an introduction and a (largely philosophical) commentary. Good though it is, it is only a beginning. For one thing, there are three more books to cover. The translation perhaps tends just a little to unnecessary archaism, and though this may be appropriate for a work in this rather sober series, it does tend to obscure the sheer excitement of Epictetus, and there is of course much more to say about him than the purely philosophical side of his work. What this splendid book brings out is the need for a really substantial new commentary on the whole of Epictetus. RICHARD WALLACE NOTES 1. Ethics. Companions to Ancient Thought: 4.

General Shades of Gimbutas (and her 'Goddess-oriented Old Europe') and the feminist movement, Ancient Goddesses' takes a hard, and fascinating, look at the 'Goddess movement', considering how a deity can be identified and need not be anthropomorph- ized, how plurality may be the rule (e.g., 'The multifaceted image of the Minoan goddess . . . is one of enduring beauty and power, but she is not alone', 132 and 'The picture which emerges from early Arcadian sanctuaries is of the worship of a very diverse group of male and female deities', 143), how relationships and symbols may be envisaged, and how divinity and society interact. Chapters on 'atalh6ytik and Gallo- British goddesses are as relevant as those on the sacred world of the Minoans and the origins of Greek goddesses. It's about time we had a spirited rebuttal of those who believe in the universalizing gynocentric. B*Ancient Greece, a Handbook2 is a collection of factual information grouped under various headings (e.g., Rulers and Leaders, Towns and Countryside, Everyday Life) and supported by effective illus- trations. This is among the best of a type notoriously difficult to compile but of a considerable value to the inexperienced in search of enlightenment. They should find it here and, if they want to go further, there are ample bibliographies. Claimed as Peter Connolly's 'crowning achievement', B* The Ancient City: Life in Classical Athens and Rome3 is the picture book. I must admit occasionally wincing though that's not the illustrator's fault - at the hideously lurid reconstruction of the three female figures from the Parthenon's east pediment (why base this on fragments of sixth-century sculpture?) and Phidias' Athene Parthenos (71 and 75) or the simpering Vestal Virgin (172), especially when compared to the facing statue in the Capitoline Museum; and I fail to see the relevance of the bronze statue of a boxer (questionably by Apollonius) to Greek sport or of Apulian vase painting (182-3) to Roman drama. Some 'facts' bothered me: Did 'the playwrights Aristophanes and Euripides both' advocate 'raising the status of women' (9)? Did Solon create 'the boule, a body of 500' (25)? Is it strictly accurate to say that 'a minimum of 6,000 citizens had to be present before an assembly (i.e., ekklesia) could take place' (28)? Is the First Pompeian style of painting derived from Greek private (as opposed to public) decoration (52-3)? But rather than identifying possible errors I prefer to stress the positive and that means the illustrations, and these grace virtually every page, are superbly presented, and most imaginatively conceived. Ask Connolly to depict Domitian's palace or the Pantheon or Trajan's Forum, and here I restrict myself to Roman examples, and the results are breathtaking. The ideal school or college prize? The title B**Rhetoric and the Law of Draco4 suggests a highly specialized subject, but even the most erudite examination is likely to offer something also to the general reader. This is very much the case here when one turns to Chapter 8 'Justifiable Killing and the Problem of Lysias I' (282-312) and Chapter 9 and its consideration of Antiphon, On the Murder of Herodes (313 ff.). The World's</page><page sequence="26">SUBJECT REVIEWS 105 Classics appears to have been transmogrified into Oxford World's Classics, and among the first so to appear is a most competent translation, B'*Herodotus, The Histories,5 supported by an equally illuminating introduction (ix-xli) with good accounts of 'narrative habits', 'the Histories as history', and 'Herodotus as thinker', Select Bibli- ography, 'Timeline', full notes (594-735), Index of Proper Names (745-72), and 10 maps. This is really excellent value for a mere pittance and I urge immediate purchase and frequent consultation. A new series from Texas, 'The Oratory of Classical Greece' aims to provide translations, supported by introductions and explanatory notes, of the Attic orators dating from c.420 to 320 B.C. The first volume features Antiphon &amp; Andocides,6 the former represented by 'Against the Stepmother' (a rich mine of information on social life and unwisely neglected), the tetralogies, the celebrated 'On the Murder of Herodes', and the intriguingly entitled 'On the Chorus Boy', and the latter by 'On the Mysteries', 'On his Return', 'On the Peace with Sparta', and 'Against Alcibiades', all texts of considerable relevance to the historian of the late fifth and early fourth century. A splendid beginning which should do much to rehabilitate the two earliest orators to survive, especially in a relatively inexpensive paperback format. The pleasures of the flesh in Classical Athens (= eating, drinking, sex) are the subject of the endlessly entertaining and equally instructive B*Courtesans and Fishcakes.2 A craving for fish, the symposium, taverns, and cups (= feasts) are topics offering plenty of 'food' for thought but more mainstream perhaps are women and boys (= desire) where the author wishes 'to emphasize the diversity and complexity of the sex market in Athens' (76). It's all here - whores, brothels (I love the cheap brothel doubling as a textile factory), and the hetaera and then there are the 'addicts', the opsophagos, to be recognized by the intensity and immediacy of his desire, the drinker, the womanizers and lovers of boys (e.g., Alcibiades and Sophocles), and the sexual degenerates known as katapugones or kinaidoi (note the rejection of the power-penetration theory and the consequent interpretation of the Eurymedon vase). But vices are expensive as is next demonstrated before Davidson concludes with a broader and more conventional look at wealth and class, politicians (especially poor old Timarchus), and the threat posed by revolutionaries and would-be tyrants. It's quite amazing how this political history of Athenian appetites is all made to fit together with great if not total success. A real pleasure to read. The latest addition to the Athenian Agora Picture Book series, *Horses and Horsemanship in the Athenian Agora8 opens, mistakenly in my opinion, by suggesting the mounted rider perhaps gave rise to the legend of the centaur (nature spirits surely and more reminiscent of the mountain stream in torrent form), carries on with the horse as a symbol of high status, horses in art, horseracing, and the Panathenaia festival (note particularly the fragment of sculpture found in 1970 which commemorates victory in the anthippasia = 41 and 42), and concludes with the Athenian cavalry (observe here the base recovered in 1990 honouring the cavalry officer Hierophanes = 45) and 'other equids', actually the donkey and mule. Quotes and illustrations are top class throughout this little booklet. In May 1998 the BBC entertained its viewers with a ten-part series set in Edwardian London which told the story of three young nannies, a kind of social history reinforcing the often expressed opinion that the British nanny was the institution, above all others, which produced the great empire-builders. Other people's babies, as Gertrude Lawrence put it, can inspire an affection deeper than even maternal love and affection may be matched by authority. It was with such thoughts in mind that I perused B*Eurykleia and her Successors9 (actually the nurses in</page><page sequence="27">106 SUBJECT REVIEWS the Libation-Bearers, Women of Trachis, Andromache, Medea, and especially Hippolytus). Commendably a very close attention is paid to the texts, but this monograph's most original idea, 'the possible development of the Nurse figure from a model of funda- mental hierarchy embodied in the figure of the lyric khoregos . . . of early choral performances' (4), is mentioned rather than investigated and throughout it struck me that one could, and one should, be rather more adventuresome in both interpretation and consideration of real life. Those two related groups ('both hold parallel positions of disempowerment', 38), women and slaves, are the topic examined in B**Women and Slaves in Greco-Roman Culture.1o Essays on literary texts, the Odyssey, Agamemnon, Euripides' Trojan plays, Plautus' Casina, and Ovidian elegy concentrate, on the whole, on the 'doubly excluded', i.e., female slaves, and are less revealing, and original, than the medical treatment of women and slaves as prescribed in the Hippocratic corpus which, in its turn, tells us less than does 'real' life as exemplified, in a brief paper, by the Roman household in law and religion or Augustine's family or Quintilian's textbook on oratory, 'an ideal pedagogy of manly virtue' (130). But easily the most informative are a survey of 'Tales of Loyalty', exempla provided by slaves (e.g., the slave of Antius Restio) and wives (e.g., Arria and her comment, 'Paete, non dolet') and, for something entirely different, Ian Morris on the archaeological evidence, mainly on slave labour in the mines and on domestic space, which weak as it undoubtedly is, still leads to a firm conclusion, 'that in Classical Athens we face an unusually pervasive male citizen culture' (218-19). A final pair of papers looks at legal disputes and a castrated slave and the cult of Cybele where, more than a little bizzarely, figurines of Attis are said to represent a penis (247)! Religion, of course, is the one area where the Greek woman could participate in public life, as is made abundantly clear by the essays published as B**The Sacred and the Feminine in Ancient Greece." Pieces on Hera, Artemis, heroines, and death ritual are interesting; more challenging are the two male contributors, Seaford on the use of the reflected image and mirror in Dionysiac mystic initiation and Lowe on the need for us to take a very much closer look at the four passages crucial for understanding of the Thesmophoria and Haloa; but best of all are Sue Blundell's reading of the Parthenon sculpture (Athene's victory over Poseidon elevated rather than downgraded man's role, as did also 'another female who achieved prominence in a male-dominated society' [62], Margaret Thatcher!) and Lesley Beaumont on why gods can be depicted as children but not goddesses (e.g., Athene and Aphrodite; see also ABSA 90 [1995], 339ff.). B** Thinking Men,12 a title which recalls Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane, is a collection of 13 papers two of which, Osborne on image and reality in sculpture and Stafford on the female iconography of personified abstracts, cover art while literature is represented by discussions of the construction of masculinity in Anacreon, Attic drama, comedy (three items on rape, Menander, and ideals of masculinity), and Juvenal, Satire 2. Mary Harlow writes on theories of procreation and how they were exploited by Romans and Christians, the latter of whom espoused a religion 'in which the mother's role is theologically vital' (155), and Gillian Clark on the difference made by the Church when it came to 'the discourse of masculinity' - 'for most people, very little; for a few, an immense difference' (180). Christian teaching, I fear, continued to sustain traditional Graeco-Roman androcentrism. But by far the most original is Lin Foxhall on 'natural sex' or 'the attribution of sex and gender to plants in ancient Greece' (57-70): 'the "masculinity" of plants is... of a quality inferior to that of the civilised Greek citizen, embodying all sorts</page><page sequence="28">SUBJECT REVIEWS 107 of unpleasant, negative and undesirable masculine characteristics. But masculinity, even of a substandard variety, was still better than femininity' (67-8). We could do with more along these lines. Walter Burkert deserved the best of tributes on the occasion of his 65th birthday and this he undoubtedly received with the 17 papers comprising **Ansichten griechischer Religion.13 It is ritual which is particularly associated with this scholar and it is, therefore, not unexpected that I Grundlagen und Reflexionen includes Jan Bremmer on terminology, II Riten in der Geschichte Hdigg on Mycenaean practice, Nanno Marinatos on Artemis, and Borgeaud on the Taurobolion, III Ritual und Trag6die Lloyd-Jones on that very topic, and IV Orphica et Philosophica Riedweg on initiation, death, and the underworld. Others may prefer to cite Henrichs on 'Dromena und Legomena' or Versnel on anatomical curses or Calame on heroic death and the O.C. My list is not exhaustive and there's obviously plenty here to cater for every interest, though no one is tempted to venture far into the field that Burkert has made very much his own, the beliefs and ritual of the very earliest hunters. But, after all, as Lloyd-Jones reminds us, 'Homo Necans was such a revolutionary book that it was not reviewed in the leading classical journals' (273; but see G&amp;R 20 [1973], 210). Things are very different today. I was somewhat disappointed to discover so much narration and so conventional a treatment of ancient religion, from the Minoan/ Mycenaean period to right the way down to Late Antiquity and Christianity, on reading through **Der religiise Gehalt der antiken Kunst und die Offenbarung.'" Illustrations are limited, small, and a bit murky but perhaps I expect too much of a scholar now well into his nineties. I prefer the Roman to the Greek chapters and, within the former, there are areas where Schefold remains very much the master, e.g., the consideration of Roman painting (361 ff.). Thorough more than exciting, B**Religion in Hellenistic Athens '~ traces historically what is claimed to be a more or less regular pattern between 338 to 86 B.C. as freedom from foreign control resulted in 'at least a putative restoration' of traditional beliefs at Athens. The Lycourgan era demonstrates a continuity linking the Classical and Hellenistic periods; change was a consequence of the dislocation of populations with the exile of the Delians and Athenian control of that island's cults of crucial importance. Much of what one anticipates after the work of Versnel and Green is shown to be absent from Athens, e.g., the elevation of a supreme deity or personal submission, when a distinction is made between the Greek Hellenistic world and Roman imperial times. Too much can too easily be made of ruler cult or Egyptian gods and too little of religion's innate conservatism. Chapters I to VII (5-100) of B Greek Medicine from the Heroic to the Hellenistic Age16 take the reader through the source material in chronological order, from 'Pre-rational and irrational medicine' to 'Early Alexandrian medical science', the final phase revealing, of course, the practice of human dissection and vivisection at the Ptolemaic capital. There follow further chapters (101-201), which look at the evidence for ethics and etiquette, the most obvious example being offered by the Hippocratic oath, disease, prognosis, dietetics, pharma- cology, anatomy, surgery, and gynaecology where, once again of course, 'the wandering womb' (XVI, 11-19) puts in a strong appearance. Each chapter is accompanied by a 'synopsis' which perhaps does a little too much of the work of the teacher by showing succinctly how the different passages, from Homer and Hesiod and the even earlier Egyptian and Mesopotamian texts to the likes of lamblichus and John Gerarde (1597), all fit together. And yet more sourcebooks appeared in 1998 and on topics even less obvious, BThe Jews among the Greeks and Romans " and BAncient Greek Laws.'8 The</page><page sequence="29">108 SUBJECT REVIEWS former covers the period 323 B.C. to c.A.D. 420, and its freshly translated texts are heavily biased towards documentary material. As the sub-title stresses, this material is related to Diasporan, rather than Palestinian, Jewry. Introductory comments, notes (181-202), and 4 appendices are helpful without removing all initiative from the teacher. The latter divides into three parts: Oikos, Agora, and Polis, and within these sections are further divisions (= Inheritance, Marriage, Sexual Offences, Personal Status; Collectivities, Trade, Finances, Leases, Coinage, Sale, Animals; Penal Regula- tions, Constitution, Procedure, Cleanliness, Property and Debts, Establishing Colonies, Polis Institutions, Building, Naval Affairs, Inter-polis Relations, Religion and Polis). The texts tend to be very familiar but all will profit from the paragraphs 'relevant texts' and even more so from those citing 'further reading'. A boon for the essay- writer? Not the first and, undoubtedly, not the last study of Greek influence on the Hellenistic Jews, B**Heritage and Hellenism" traces 'Jewish reconceptualization in Hellenic terms' (xix) or the reinvention of their own past by the Jews. Thus the Exodus story was reshaped so as 'to elevate their own part in the history of their adopted land' (72), while Joseph, as presented by Philo for example, is a man of moral excellence and an outstanding leader, i.e., the ideal statesman. Imagination, it is argued, could also play its part in the embellishment or fabrication of the stories of such as David, Abraham (= even depicted as the ultimate source of Greek learning) or Moses, a military as well as a culture hero; Alexander was made to visit Jerusalem where 'the mighty conqueror paid due homage to the Temple, its priests, and its divinity' (243); even more remarkable were the fiction of Spartan-Jewish affiliation and the commandeering of the voice of the Sibyl. Gruen's conclusion is as inevitable as it is convincing: 'The world of Greek culture was not an alien one to Hellenistic Jews. They thrived within it and they made its conventions their own' (297). Although relatively little has been recovered so far from the Hellenistic capital to indicate its fabulous wealth (but keep your eye on the recent Pharos discoveries), you would scarcely believe this having surveyed the illustrations presented in Alexandria.20 Even the very familiar, e.g., Sophilos' mosaic with its bust of Berenike II, the frescoes from the villa of Fannius Synistor (= 'die Sympathisanten in Italien') or the bronze bust of Octavian from Meroe, is made to appear devastatingly fresh, and new reconstructions, e.g., of the fourth Ptolemy's 'palace-ship' or state barge (cf. Athenaeus v 204d-206c), dazzle the eye. Treatment is chronological, and each reign boasts its own splendours such as the third-century mosaic showing erotes as hunters or the second-century mosaics of dog and of wrestlers, and these splendours are most skilfully deployed here, from 'die Grtindung' to 'das Ende'. Perhaps, however, a discussion of Alexandria and the background to Pompeii and its second style wall paintings (and of Petra's 'royal' tombs?) would have added even more in the way of grandeur. There can be no better introduction to the new series Oxford Archaeological Guides than Amanda Claridge's B*Rome,21 especially as the detailed descriptions of the Forum, Palatine, Imperial Forums, Field of Mars, Capitol, Circus Flaminius to Circus Maximus, Colosseum Valley, Caelian Hill, and 'other sites' are preceded by consideration of building materials, techniques, and types and followed by accounts of the museums and catacombs. Paragraphs set out in grey add touches of information often of the kind beloved by the tourist. The illustrations are also first rate and my very occasional reservations are more quibbles than criticisms (e.g., the dates 50-20 B.C. for Rome's conflict with the Parthians, 99; the virtual disappearance of the Arch of Titus in the fold of 142-3; and a surprising acceptance as</page><page sequence="30">SUBJECT REVIEWS 109 genuine of the Ludovisi throne, 401). In the eleventh, and final, paper presented in **Trade, Traders and the Ancient City22 John Davies attempts, most valiantly, 'to describe the main intellectual currents, to criticise them in various ways, and to set out an alternative route forward' (230), no mean objective given the earlier chapters on Ashur, the Black Sea region, Chios, Athens' grain trade, Italy (from archaic central Italy to Christian origins in the northern part of that country), and Roman Egypt. The result is a complex map which traces economic flows but remains limited inasmuch as 'it describes structures and networks, not human needs or the motivations of... traders or travellers' (251). B**Die friihkaiserzeitlichen Heiligtiimer der Karawanenstationem im hellenis- ierten Osten23 looks at, and illustrates quite beautifully, the temples of Petra (Qasr al- Bint, Winged Lion, and South Temple), Jerash (Zeus) and lesser known sites in Jordan and other edifices from Syria (the two Bel temples from Palmyra), Lebanon (Jupiter Heliopolitanus), and Irak. Translated from the Hebrew and newly edited, B**From Function to Monument: Urban Landscapes of Roman Palestine, Syria and Provincia Arabia24 is a useful compilation whose material is grouped under the headings Colonnaded Streets, Public Plazas, Gates and Gate-like Structures, and Nymphaea. In publishing it Oxbow might have insisted on rather better and more up-to-date plans and photos, though some of the latter, I suppose, do have a historic interest. Probably it's just me but I find reference to Amman's odeum as a theatre rather irritating and wonder whether its nymphaeum is really a fountain house (see its location, plan, and dimensions); I also doubt the existence of Petra's 'small theatre' and its various markets. I suspect that it will be less the first two 'Sections' (Urban Structures and Regional Studies = Syria, Judaea, and the Persian Gulf) and much more Section 3: Images and Identities which will attract the average reader of ** The Early Roman Empire in the East.25 Here, more generally, Rose looks at the imperial image in sculpture, Braund at Greek ambivalence towards the Black Sea area, Cormack at funerary monuments in Asia Minor and Schmidt-Colinet at Palmyra's tombs, and Elsner at how 'through religious expansion, the Roman east struck back at the imperial appropriation of its sacred and civic spaces' (189). So much information is conveyed in B**Blood in the Arena26 that I was surprised that the amphitheatres of North Africa, and especially El Jem's massive edifice, were neglected. It is my belief that the growing violence to be detected in today's 'sports', and the type of futuristic film falling in the Rollerball category, make sophisticated explanations of the Romans' passion for blood somewhat redundant. You surely don't need to quote Aztecs or Carthaginians to understand the ritualized slaughter of humans, and I must admit to becoming more than a little disturbed when I read that the death of the gladiator 'served as a foundation sacrifice that answered the crisis of empire, validating the Roman struggle for power' (170). I am altogether happier with the argument that 'the munera had, in the last century of the Republic, become a tool for canny politicians to use in building a power base' (212). That is a proposition that I can appreciate. It is 'Renaissance Seneca' from Henry Howard to Matthew Prior, which provides the bulk (3-142) of Seneca in English27 though those representing 'Modern Seneca' are likely to be better known names, e.g., T. S. Eliot, Ted Hughes, and Caryl Churchill. Generous extracts enhance the value of this collection of translations, and commentary, brief as it is, can be illuminating, e.g., the discussion of Eliot on the playwright (148-52). Equally influential, of course, is Ovid and so we have the companion Ovid in English,28 and here we range from Chaucer to such twentieth-century stalwarts as Robert Graves, Rolfe Humphries, Peter</page><page sequence="31">110 SUBJECT REVIEWS Green ('His 1982 translation of the love poetry . .. is a landmark for English readers', 352), David R. Slavitt, and the Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and the Nobel Prize winner Seamus Heaney. But it is Guy Lee and his 'fresh rethinking' (347) of the Amores which remain a personal favourite. But did any Classical author have a greater impact on a later period of time than Cicero on Tudor England? A strongly negative response is suggested by B**Master Tully29 in which lucid chapters on the orator's life and philosophical beliefs are followed by accounts of the 'rediscovery' of Cicero, already in the fifteenth century 'not only a staple of the continental market but in some centres a best seller' (117), and the Tudor grammar school, publishing, and Oxbridge before we conclude with Cicero as a 'cult-figure' or 'Cicero-worship'. It is the personalities involved (and their quarrels!) which make for a good story engagingly told. A less formidable volume than you might imagine. Volume 97 of **Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,30 though dated 1995, was received late in 1998. It is a special (and unique) issue, representing a colloquium devoted to Greek influence and its reception at Rome and outside whose 14 papers consider (1) Religion, (2) Languages, Institutions, Regions, (3) Hellenistic Philosophy (= Cicero and Seneca), (4) Art and Archaeology, (5) Literary Links (= parasites, Georgics, Seneca's tragedies), and (6) Cultural Links. It's all there - including terminology, social origin, life style, medical features, cult practice, location, customers (I particularly liked 'die jeunesse doree'!), pimps, prices, brothels, the philosophical position, and prostitution and the law - in B**Prostitution in der r'mischen Antike31 and in greater depth than you might think possible, even given a bibliography of 41 pages; and thus the need noted in the latest OCD ('Much work remains to be done on this important aspect of social history') is being most impressively met. Packed with information and generously illustrated, BArchdologischer Wegweiser durch Portugal32 is arranged conventionally beginning with brief accounts of the main chronological periods (e.g., Megalithik, die r6mische Zeit) followed by a gazetteer listing 'die Fundplitze' (57-209), 305 of them in all. Pomponius Mela 'is now a hot topic again' according to F. E. Romer (29) whose translation of The Chorography33 certainly fills a gap though there have been in excess of 150 printed editions since the editio princeps of 1471. Almost certainly the most important book in this batch of reviews, for the student at least, is the long- awaited BReligions of Rome,34 a systematic, and enlightened, 'history', from 'Early Rome' to 'Roman religion and Christian emperors' (= Volume 1) and a 'sourcebook' (= Volume 2) where the evidence, literary, archaeological, numismatic, and epigraphic, is supplied and more than simply supplied - it is also generously annotated and accompan- ied by the appropriate illustrations which are similarly equipped with notes. Nothing is easy when it is a matter of religion and this is fully appreciated by authors who, when it comes to a reputed 'neglect' in the Late Republic, point out that 'both sides of the coin have to be taken seriously' (126) or readily admit that the interpretation of the frieze from the Villa of the Mysteries is 'extremely difficult' (162) or find 'the picture is much more complicated' (279) in the case of the Persian background of Mithras. It might not be easy but this does not preclude clarity of exposition whether it's the first volume and its chronological story or the second and its thematic arrangement (e.g., 'the deities of Rome', 'priests and priestesses', 'threats to the Roman order'). The sourcebook marks a new stage in the development of this type of aid from its cover illustration of a tomb portrait of a 'gallus' ('Note the effeminacy of the portrayal and how the priest proudly displays the objects usually treated derisively by Roman writers', 211) to its concluding</page><page sequence="32">SUBJECT REVIEWS 111 passage, Augustine on Varro's theories of religion ('a clear example of how complicated [indeed impossible] it is entirely to disentangle the separate strands of traditional thought and Christianity', 362). I can see courses on Roman religion proliferating and attracting large enrolments from now on. Now that the examination boards are offering their own vocabulary lists it might be felt that B*Classical Greek Prose: a Basic Vocabulary"3 is redundant. At the same time, however, it is rather different in being university designed and organized on a relatively novel basis - words are not strung together alphabetically but grouped according to type (= nouns, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions, verbs, and 'other words') and then subdivided (e.g., masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns and, further, masculine nouns - As, genitive - 0 Y). Again, an entry may be expanded as in the case of the very first word listed: 'vEavias young man, youth, sts with ref. to headstrong, unruly, irresponsible conduct', while a Supplement (85-101) deals at greater length with 100 'very important basic words', beginning this time with dyaOds. This is a more sophisticated compilation, and therefore more useful, than its title might suggest and I recommend it with considerable enthusiasm. Only Peter Jones could hope to get away with the jokes and cartoons (and the methodology?) of Learn Ancient Greek,36 a companion to Learn Latin. I need hardly say that it's great fun and quite outrageous throughout, and I do admire the way in which no punches are pulled - 'Anyone learning a language reaches a crunch point ... at that crunch point, those with a gift for languages will move on, the rest will not' (3). Some may find the chatty tone (see, e.g., the final paragraph of page 93) irritating and possibly patronizing (see, e.g,, 'Def Art (1) 2b on page 32) or throw up their hands in horror when told 'in this course we will say almost nothing about the ending of nouns at all' (35), but it seems to work well up to a point provided you accept the limited reading target (viii). Interest is also sustained by 'The Greek world', a sort of potted history which, however, makes too much of the hoplite revolution (75) and of the use of lot (82 and 90), surely a procedure to eliminate undue influence rather than a sign of 'real democracy'. Concluding grammatical summary and vocabularies should be a great help. He who dares . . .? Documents in Medieval Latin" comprises some 80 texts dating from the Anglo-Saxon period or sixth century (= Nennius) on, and includes, in the main, legal and ecclesiastical documents, charters, court rolls, and extracts from the Domes- day Book and historians after 1066. Help is provided by a survey of 'resources' (really an annotated bibliography) and, perhaps to the distress of some instructors, translations of the texts cited. An obvious gap is filled and none of the passages is so long as to impose too grievous a strain on the student. Neat rather than 'lively' as is claimed. I must say I have spent quite some time on many occasions skimming happily through A Dictionary of Latin Words and Phrases."3 I never appreciated how many of them there were and how suited to every contingency. I also enjoyed the references whether drawn from the likes of Nesbit's Railway Children ('He won't keep cave') or from the Observer of November 1984: 'Whatever might have happened to other "wets" on their via dolorosa. . . .' This is a 'fun' book though it misses out on my favourite exploitation of Latin's best known tag - timeo Danaos .. .: in a Hollywood film whose title escapes me Walter Matthau takes a woman out for dinner at a terrible Greek restaurant where they are served by an extremely short waiter wearing 'elevator' shoes, a situation which allows Matthau to remark that he fears Greeks especially when they're wearing lifts! The line needs to be delivered, of course, in an appropriately lugubrious tone. Of little more than academic (or even antiquarian?) interest in identifying</page><page sequence="33">112 SUBJECT REVIEWS Christian beliefs or sentiments in Greek literature and philosophy, Simone Weil's Intimations of Christianity among the Ancient Greeks39 was reissued as a Routledge paperback in 1998. More than fifty years have passed since Weil's death, and this passage of time has not dealt kindly with an approach which, for example, sees a parallel between the 'crucifixion' of Prometheus and the silence of Isaiah's just man and the silence of Christ. And does Prometheus suffer for love of mankind and in man's stead, and can the Titan be made 'the Lamb slain' (70)? A celebration of its author's sixty-fifth birthday, **Men in their Books 4 opens with Calder's bibliography for the years 1984-1997, an impressive total of 355 items though not all are suitable for a RAE evaluation, and continues with 21 papers on the modern history of Classical scholarship. Wilamowitz looms large, not surprisingly since he is rated the 'greatest Hellenist who ever lived' (167; cf. 181), but then Calder has always preferred 'German scientific professionalism' to 'English dilettantism' (142-3; cf. 263). He may well be right when he says he is convinced 'that although merit . .. is indispensable, it is rarely decisive in academic appointments of importance' (225), but much of this book leaves an unpleasant taste in the mouth. I find it hard to stomach when E. A. Havelock is described as 'an opportunistic English leftist' for whom Calder professes 'ill-concealed contempt' (291). P. WALCOT NOTES 1. Ancient Goddesses.

Reprints I do not predict great success for the 1998 revised printing by Kendall/Hunt of Ancient Greece: Documentary Perspectives.1 The passages translated in this paperback cover Politics and Society, Philosophy, Religion, The Greeks at War, Women in Greece, The Greek Outlook: Drama and Poetry, and Science, but the choice of passages strikes me as being idiosyncratic (e.g., the inclusion of the Homeric Hymns to Gaia and Ares but no other), and I am often bothered by the information conveyed in introductory paragraphs: to take a single example chosen at random, how do we know that Theocritus' Gorgo and Praxinoa were 'young', and how can this idyll be called a 'play' (256)? Among the best general books on the poet, though showing signs of age in an area where new excavations, e.g., at Troy itself, force continuous modification, Latacz's B*Homer 2 became available as a University of Michigan paperback in 1998. Its chapters on the Iliad and Odyssey with their descriptions of themes and segments deserve close attention (cf. G&amp;R 44 [1997], 218). Appearing as a University of Texas paperback in 1998 The Ages of Homer3 confirms a belief that this is currently the most exciting compilation of papers on Homer and the Bronze Age (Part I), Homer and the Iron Age (Part II), and After Homer: Narrative and Representation, mainly on pots (Part III). Individual contributions may, on occasions, be brief (cf. G&amp;R 43 [1996], 112-13) but I repeat earlier advice: 'Do get your hands on this collection - it is quite superb.' Not strictly a reprint since two of its ten essays are new (and a further three translated from Italian), Pietro Pucci's **The Song of the Sirens 4 appeared in 1998 in Rowman and Littlefield's Greek Studies: Interdisciplinary Approaches series. The first of the new offerings looks at 'Odysseus Narrator' and, in the main, the account of his adventures as related to the Phaeacians; the other considers Agamemnon and Achilles. Both are long (131-77 and 179-230), detailed, and display an enviable acquaintance with the secondary literature, though I fear the enlightenment attained is scarcely commensurate with the effort clearly expended. Too diffuse to be really convincing. Similar in type, and also from Rowman and Littlefield in 1998, was **Aglaia5 or an introduction and 16 papers from the indefatigable Charles Segal of which just the brief introduction and one chapter, on Helen in Sappho, Alcaeus, and Ibycus, are new. The poets considered otherwise are Alcman (the Partheneion of course), Pindar (8 papers), Bacchylides (3 pieces), and Corinna where we do have a 1997 Addendum (319-23) on the date of the poetess - 'The issue is still an open question. My own preference remains for the later date' (320), sensible</page><page sequence="36">SUBJECT REVIEWS 115 man. B**Eros: the Myth of Ancient Greek Sexuality6 may discuss a destructive force but still succeeds in often sounding a cheerful (and quirky - see G&amp;R 44 [1997], 245) note. No one could deny the author's independence of mind and unwillingness to pull his punches, as is revealed, for example, by the 'Critical Bibliography' (245-68). I applaud the 1997 paperback from Westview Press of this very personal assessment of erotic power and the fear it engenders. Disorganized perhaps but never without interest. I most warmly welcome also a Harvard 1998 paperback of B Creation of the Sacred,' though I still wonder (cf. G&amp;R 44 [1997], 110) whether its separate parts added together comprise a convincing whole. The chapter 'The Reciprocity of Giving' (129-5 5) is, for me, the most enthralling discussion, but throughout I remain amazed by a combination of historical and philological research and biological anthropology which only Burkert so far has been able to master. Ideas and suggestions abound but never fail to be substantiated by compelling evidence. This book is even better when re- read. Be warned - BLate Antiquity8 is a Harvard 1998 paperback reprint of Peter Brown's chapters from the first volume of A History of Private Life. That, of course, does not mean that it's not worth reading if one wishes to trace the transition from the ancient city to the Christian church over the four centuries from the reign of Marcus Aurelius to that of Justinian. A very favourable reception from the reviewers (even male reviewers though only women's assessments figure on the back cover: cf. G&amp;R 43 [1996], 225) helps to account for Harvard's 1998 paperback reprint of BSappho's Immortal Daughters.9 'Lucid' is the usual adjective applied to a study whose fourth chapter 'Sexuality and Ritual' (90-132) ought to be read by all students: it offers a clear, full, and eminently sensible survey of women's position in Greek society (even if it does refer to Hesiod 'writing in the seventh century' [113] where the date bothers me less than the term 'writing', and we are told that the only women admitted to symposia were slaves [116] with hetairai ignored). This is a book which provides pleasure as much as understanding and both in abundance. Harvard was not going to wait too long before producing, actually in 1998, a paperback of its own professor's Sophocles' Tragic World,"o and it was certainly right to do so (cf. G&amp;R 43 [1996], 226). I suspect that the chapter most likely to command attention is one of the four on the O. T., 'Freud, Language, and the Unconscious' (161-79). I still myself prefer a historical reading of the play as an investigation into the problem of knowledge, but readily admit that Segal makes an excellent job of arguing also for a psychological interpreta- tion. The 'indigent' (G&amp;R 44 [1997], 86) have had to wait until 1998 for Oxford to include among its Clarendon Paperbacks '3Tragedy and the Tragic.11 Its 29 offerings, grouped under the headings 'Readings' (discussing the O. T., Antigone, Ion, and Oresteia), 'Contexts' (including comedy, the chorus, Dionysus, and Plato), and 'Perspectives and Definitions' (extending as far as Shakespeare and modern Irish drama), are fairly described as exhibiting 'an outward-looking spirit' which justifies the subtitle 'Greek Theatre and Beyond'. Stephen Halliwell's much praised (see G&amp;R 45 [1998], 226-7) translation of Aristophanes can now be had for a fraction of its hardback price in the Oxford World's Classics series and only one year after B*Aristophanes, Birds, Lysistrata, Assembly-Women, Wealth12 was first issued in 1997. I readily endorse the opinion that the general introduction (ix-lxvi) is 'superb' and the introductions to the individual comedies 'excellent'. The rock-bottom price suggests extensive sales are anticipated and rightly so. A 1998 Clarendon Paperback of B**Personality in Greek Epic, Tragedy, and Philosophy 13 has allowed minor corrections</page><page sequence="37">116 SUBJECT REVIEWS and bibliographical additions to the 1996 hardback, on which see G&amp;R 44 (1997), 110. Also released as a 1998 Clarendon Paperback was Lyne's B Words and the Poet,14 a study which has met a somewhat mixed reception (cf. G&amp;R 37 [1990], 227-9), not that the author is much inclined to take 'modern literary theory' into ac- count. Combined in a single (and terribly heavy?) paperback reprint in 1998 from Johns Hopkins U.P. Volume I of **Asclepius"15 collects 861 testimonies (text and translation), from legend to sanctuaries, while Volume II proceeds to interpret this evidence (as conveniently described by Gary Ferngren, xvii ff.). The primary sources are nearly all (see xxi n. 21) there but not the archaeological material. Also re- printed as a paperback in 1998 by Johns Hopkins, BGreek and Roman Maps 16 is still the standard work on a topic with which its author was very much acquainted (cf. G&amp;R 33 [1986], 222). It has an appeal to that elusive creature, the general reader, while not ignoring the needs of the scholar as is manifested by the seven appendices (183- 201). A paperback in 1998 from Cambridge, BPlato and the Socratic Dialogue17 followed fast on the heels of the 1996 hardback and understandably so since this comprehensive overview, from the literary and intellectual background to the Phaedrus and the limits of writing, tries to show how, in the early and middle dialogues, Plato does not defend 'fundamentally different philosophies at different stages of his career' (xiv). As a result the role of Socrates is much reduced but not as much as that of Xenophon who, apparently, 'has no personal understanding of philosophy at all' (87)! Allen's translation (with comment) of Plato's Ion, Hippias Minor, Laches, and Protagoras 1 was issued as a paperback by Yale in 1998, thus solving the previous noted (see G&amp;R 44 [1997], 103) problem of too high a price. A new paperback in 1998 from Yale has enabled Bernard Knox to point out how Oedipus at Thebes 19 was largely ignored when first published in 1957 (but see G&amp;R 5 [1958], 91, 'a fair and reasonable essay . . . both [the non-Greek reader and the scholar] will find much to divert and inspire in its pages'). Its influence has been colossal although personally I find it difficult to accept that 'Oedipus . . . is a microcosm of the people of Periclean Athens' (67), however many parallels are drawn from contemporary writ- ings. B The Sceptics20 is a 1998 paperback reprint from Routledge's The Arguments of the Philosophers series, the first part of which is 'historical' (with, e.g., chapters on 'Precursors' and 'The Scepticism of the Early Empire') and the second 'a topically-ordered exposition and analysis of Sextan Scepticism' (155). The clarity of exposition characteristic of the author throughout is well illustrated when he discusses the sceptic way of life and turns to the (universal?) experience of the motorist to show how 'the Sceptic will back no horses' (295). One is definitely left feeling that Hankinson does really engage in a debate with the reader. Farquharson's translation B The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus 21 was reissued as an Oxford World's Classics paperback in 1998, reinforced with an introduction and notes by Richard Rutherford who has, in addition, supplied an appendix consisting of translations of some of the letters exchanged between Marcus and his tutor Fronto (119-43). Rutherford makes the valid point that the Meditations, while often despondent, are almost never despairing, no mean achievement when you note that Book II was written 'among the Quadi' and Book III 'in Carnuntum', that is, when the emperor was on campaign. All right, it is undoubtedly too generous in its assessment of its subject (cf. G&amp;R 42 [1995], 93-4), but B**Philip of Macedon,22 issued as a paperback by Duckworth in 1998, has much to recommend it: here I would single out the chapter on the strengths and weaknesses of</page><page sequence="38">SUBJECT REVIEWS 117 the city-state (the latter including, in the fourth century, mercenary soldiers and generals, lawyer-politicians, and other specialists, nationalism and inter-state animosity, and the bitterness of internal politics, though I don't believe, despite what Xenophon has to say, in a collapse of religious belief) and the discussion of the occupants of Vergina's royal tombs (Tomb I Amyntas III; Tomb II Philip and either a Getic or a Scythian wife; Tomb III Alexander IV; and the Tomb of Eurydice, 43-4 and 178-82). I can't imagine many having the knowledge (or time or even temerity?) to attempt the type of synoptic investigation undertaken by Galinsky in B**Augustan Culture,23 available since 1998 as a Princeton Paperback. Most unfairly but understandably once described in my hearing as a poor man's Zanker, this book seems to touch upon almost everything, history, ideas, art and architecture, literature, and religion, and often more than once, hence the value of the lists of illustrations, passages, and topics. For myself I rate Augustus' personality as decidedly more than 'interesting and complex' (388), though I would also make much of his extraordinarily lengthy tenure of power and the over- whelming attraction of peace after bloody civil wars - more of a Franco than a Mussolini? A 1998 third edition, thirty years after its original appearance, has enabled Peter Green to make a 'radical reassessment' of his Penguin B*Juvenal, the Sixteen Satires,24 and the consequence is a 'version ... very different from' the 'original text'. In fact 'there is scarcely a line that has not been subjected to close scrutiny' (ix). The result is well worth the effort as also are the appraisal of others' work (see especially the comments on Willis's Teubner text) and the lengthy introduction (xii-lxvii) in which an exile to Egypt is accepted and a revealing comparison with Dickens developed. Each Satire is accompanied by a book list (= Useful General Studies) and full notes (123-234). I do not quarrel with the description 'a Juvenal with treasure-trove for student and general reader alike' on the back cover. It really is first-class value for a very modest sum. 'Juvenal Revisited' is the title of one of the 16 essays in Classical Bearings,25 a collection of papers by Peter Green reprinted as a paperback by the University of California Press in 1998. But don't neglect to read also the pieces on 'Sex and Classical Literature' (from Homer on), 'The Macedonian Connection' (on the Vergina tombs and modern politics), and the translation of Ovid's love poetry. But every paper here is worthy of the most serious consideration - don't be deceived by the author's lightness of touch. A 1998 Cambridge paperback reprint, B**Money and Government in the Roman Empire,26 is no easy read (cf. G&amp;R 42 [1995], 238) but shows, quite decisively, how the level of monetization was restricted and uneven. Crucial conclusions are reached especially on army costs, which in the mid-second century totalled between 72% and 77% of the Empire's budget. Students will be grateful to Johns Hopkins U.P. for its 1998 paperback edition of B*Houses, Villas, and Palaces in the Roman World27 (cf. G&amp;R 23 [1976], 207), though only the first two of its three claims, 'to provide a readable, informative, and up-to-date survey' (9), are valid. Nothing later than 1973 is cited in the bibliography and so the Oplontis villa is ignored, and statements about, for example, the 'oriental' background of the Etruscans or the light death toll at Herculaneum stand in urgent need of revision. I am also bothered by the plural form cryptoportici (30), 'the House of Menander' (53), and the preferred date for the villa near Piazza Armerina (133). Still, the approach is commendably down to earth, the right questions are asked and answered sensibly, the provinces (esp. Britain) as well as Rome and Italy are covered, and a chapter on interior furnishing and decoration included, and all in one volume. Since 'we have needed a book like</page><page sequence="39">118 SUBJECT REVIEWS this for a long time' (G&amp;R 43 [1996], 244), Yale's paperback edition of B*Hadrian's Villa and its Legacy28 is to be enthusiastically applauded, especially, for me at least, because of its discussion of the emperor himself (12-23), its description of 'unfamiliar architecture' (= Ceremonial Precinct, Fountain Court West, Island Enclosure, 'a kind of built coin, with Hadrian the sentient man at its center replacing the coin's image' [89], Smaller Baths, Reverse-Curve Pavilion, Water Court, Arcaded and Scenic Triclinium) on pages 78-116, and 'Art' (139-82). The illustrations are many, varied, and most helpful to understanding. There will not be many better books published in 1998. An old favourite, the second edition of B* These were the Romans29 was reprinted as a paperback in 1998 by Duckworth. The illustrations are most cunningly organized though I do rather hesitate at the juxtaposition of a panel showing that most benign of emperors Marcus Aurelius addressing his troops and Ernst Rohm inspecting storm troopers. I see greater merit in B**Leisure and Ancient Rome,30 a 1998 paperback from Polity Press, than the hardback's reviewer (G&amp;R 43 [1996], 100), though I too find the style and looseness of structure an irritation. It also strikes me as being more than a little pretentious in places. But it does take into account taverns and drinking, the baths, gambling, and sex as well as the imperial games, and its author is well acquainted with the sources, both primary and secondary, even if facts tend to be squeezed out by the heavy theorizing. Originally published thirty years ago, "Food in Antiquity 31 appeared in 1998 as a Johns Hopkins paperback. Organized on the basis of types of food, e.g., fungi, cereal crops, fruit and nuts, and relying especially on the archaeological evidence, this survey has acquired an extra chapter (193-223) which introduces the latest literature, discoveries, such as the Vari 'beehives' (200-1), and ideas including the question of food and human evolution and urban-rural contrasts, the latter 'clearly a fruitful area for further investigation' (195 and 213). Even BSE, 'an unpleasant zoonosis' (205), gets a look in, though the J. E. Jones reference needs extending and there is good evidence from the Aegean region of cannibalism, e.g., from Knossos (but compare Works and Days 276-80). Walter Scheidel has edited and provided addenda to B Cities, Peasants and Food in Classical Antiquity,32 a collection of 16 papers by Peter Garnsey, two published here for the first time in English ('An Association of Builders in Late Antique Sardis' and 'The Bean: Substance and Symbol'). Of a special interest are the pieces on the decline of the urban aristocracy, freedmen, urban property investment, peasants and non-slave labour, mountain economies, and 'food' but all are essential reading for the social historian. The Princeton Mythos series was extended in 1998 to include BDreams in Late Antiquity,33 a study which deserves to be more widely known (cf. G&amp;R 42 [1995], 249), and this paperback version should guarantee that. Generously, and quite rightly, praised on its original publication in 1984 (see G&amp;R 32 [1985], 95), B*The Making of the Roman Army34 appeared as a Routledge paperback in 1998. This exceptionally well illustrated, clearly written, and detailed account now has rather more rivals (see the Addenda, 258-9; and, for comment, 8-10), but will remain securely placed at the top of reading lists. The course of battles can be followed with ease (and with interest). Published also in 1998 by Routledge as a paperback, and appearing with commendable speed (see G&amp;R 45 [1998], 112), BPrayer from Alexander to Constantine35 provides course tutors with a most helpful source book or, as it is actually sub-titled, 'critical anthology'. A hope was realised in 1996 (cf. G&amp;R 37 [1990], 235) when Routledge published a second edition of B* The Student's Catullus,36 a</page><page sequence="40">SUBJECT REVIEWS 119 paperback designed 'to become the standard college textbook' or, in this country, to serve the needs of the A level candidate. The 1998 Alan Sutton reprint of Wacher's *Roman Britain3? has up-dated text and illustrations 'where necessary' though major alteration is confined to Further Reading. Orthodox in its presentation, this engaging account of the province does feature some unexpected photos, e.g., of Colchester's Balkerne Gate (and The Hole in the Wall pub) and a winged phallus drawing a chariot from Wroxeter, though nearly all would do with being lighter in shade. A revised and expanded fourth edition issued by Oxford in1998, B* The Holy Land 38 serves as the flagship of the new Oxford Archaeological Guides (see above, pp. 108-9). Illustrations have been redrawn, text revised, six fresh entries added (e.g., 'Roman Roads', 396-402), and over seventy grey 'boxes' introduced which, with a few exceptions, provide a mini-anthology of ancient texts. Part I covers the city of Jerusalem, while Part 2 comprises an A-Z guide to the sites with a handful of 'ethnic' entries - Crusades, Druze, Essenes, Nabataeans, Philistines, and Samaritans. The new format and a better quality paper make all the difference to this paperback. Issued in a revised edition by Tauris in 1998, the paperback B*Imperial Istanbul39 also covers Iznik, Bursa, and Edirne. Its routes lead the traveller through the Byzantine monuments, from the Hippodrome to the Kariye Camii, and then the Ottoman remains, beginning with Giulhane Park and ending with the Belgrade Forest before Galata and Pera, the Asiatic side, and the Bosphorus are surveyed. There is the occasional slip - does the base of Theodosius' obelisk depict the emperor erecting the obelisk as well as attending the events and receiving homage from captives? - but there are also some neat touches as with the potted biography of the empress Zoe and of the redoubtable Roxelana, and plenty of detail is painlessly imparted. Something has gone wrong on page 316 where the description of the first and second floors of the Archaeological Museum as well could do with extension: my memory is of a strange concentration on the antiquities of Cyprus which serves a contemporary political rather than a scholarly interest, and the Trojan material is worth greater attention. Routledge deserves the warmest thanks for publishing so much on classical antiquity and not least because of its policy of releasing paperback versions of books which students would otherwise be unable to afford. Such paperbacks included in 1998 B**Inventing Ancient Culture,40 a collection of ten papers on sex and social history and on periodization, e.g., the Dark Age and the Peloponnesian War (cf. G&amp;R 45 [1998], 110). There's plenty to excite here and none more so than Ian Morris and Barry Strauss, the latter of whom reminds us that 'periodization is both the requisite framework and the false friend of all history-writing' (165), though I suspect that Amy Richlin on 'body history' or Martin Kilmer on painters and pederasts will attract more readers. Also a paperback from Rout- ledge but dated to 1997, BSiren Feasts41 is an impressive survey covering food and gastronomy in Greece from the prehistoric Aegean to the Byzantine period (cf. G&amp;R 43 [1996], 254). As was predicted, my hardback edition is well-thumbed. I was amused but not surprised to see on the back cover an endorsement from Hampstead &amp; Highgate Express. It takes a brave man to compete against the likes of Walter Burkert or Martin West, but the 1997 Routledge paperback version of B**Greek Myths and Mesopotamia: Parallels and Influence in the Homeric Hymns and Hesiod42 shows that bravery alone is not enough; it must be supported by convincing analogies and sound scholarship neither of which is always evident here. No longer a Batsford publication, BTheodosius: the Empire at Bay 43 appeared in 1998 as a Routledge paper-</page><page sequence="41">120 SUBJECT REVIEWS back. 'A balanced account' (see G&amp;R 42 [1995], 239-40) taking the reader from the battle at Adrianople to the river Frigidus conflict and the final triumph of Christianity ('but in other ways it had solved little', 137), it also includes a chapter on Stilicho whose errors, it is plausibly argued, 'were not those of greed or personal ambition, but ... of idealism' (158). An excellent read. Andrianople similarly features in another 1998 Routledge paperback, B**Exploratio,44 a comprehensive (cf. G&amp;R 43 [1996], 253) and judicious (though I still remain dubious when it comes to Trajan and the 'mushroom message') review of the evidence which reveals that, as the Empire drew to a close, 'Roman intelligence, both tactical and strategic, was very good indeed. But ... military and political survival do not depend solely on good intelligence', 246. 1998 saw Routledge produce a second edition of B*City of Sokrates,45 a long established and sound account of fifth-century Athens under the headings Country and town, Popula- tion, property, taxation, Radical democracy, The imperial ethos, Schooling, literacy, books and history, Religion, Art and patronage, Science, nature, culture and the sophists, and Philosophy. I have heard this book called the best introduction to its subject and that is a verdict I would not challenge, especially with its corrected text and up-dated bibliography. Well known to students, Sear's B*Roman Architecture46 found a new publisher in 1998, Routledge taking over from Batsford. The black-and- white drawings are plentiful and better than the somewhat murky photos; occasionally a fuller discussion is required, e.g., of the date of the Piazza Armerina villa (269). This paperback, however, is excellent value in taking us from Republican Rome to the Late Empire, including on the way chapters on building techniques and materials, separate accounts of Pompeii and Ostia, and full coverage of the provinces. Three further 'classics' were added to Bristol Classical Press and its Advanced Language imprint in 1998, paperback editions of Buck's 1955 B** The Greek Dialects,47 Goodwin's (more than a century old!) **Syntax of the Moods and Tenses of the Greek Verb,48 and Raven's **Latin Metre (1965).49 I have always found Part II: Selected Inscriptions of the first a most useful teaching tool; this author's scholarship is suggested by a mere three pages (xiv-xvi) of Errata especially when we read 'these errors were due to the ill health and weak eyesight of the author, who died in his eighty-eighth year, 8 February 1955'. It is the wealth of examples cited in the second which maintains its value even today; the third demands concentration since it covers a great deal of ground, but it remains the best introduction (cf. G&amp;R 12 [1965], 237). Examples are plentiful also in another paperback, but a much slimmer one this time, from Bristol Classical Press in 1998, *Greek Prose Usage.so If you're going to attempt Greek composition, it's worth keeping a copy close at hand, though it had a decidedly old-fashioned air about it even when it was first published in 1955. 1998 also saw Bristol Classical Press add to its Paperback series B*Themes in Roman Satire."5 I have always been struck by the 'snappy' titles of this book's chapters and their sub-divisions, e.g., 'Women and Sex' incorporating 'adultery', 'fornication', and 'homosexuality', though I ought really to refer to the most successful treatment by theme or topic, i.e., 'Aims and Motives', 'Freedom and Authority', 'Style and Public', 'Class and Patronage', 'Greek and the Greeks', and 'Women and Sex'. One of the very best of its type being dense and informative but invariably easy to read. Also reprinted by Bristol Classical Press in 1998 was an edition originally designed in 1962 to 'enlarge the range of reading matter available in the middle forms of schools' (v). Those were the days! *Euripides, Scenes from Rhesus and Helen52 comprises about 500 lines from each of these two plays</page><page sequence="42">SUBJECT REVIEWS 121 but with no chorus passages. Notes on 'quite elementary' points of language and full vocabulary mean that adult beginners will find this edition most helpful (though an awful lot is read into the text of Rhesus at 1l. 442-4). Yet another series from Bristol Classical Press is its Classic Commentaries on Latin and Greek Texts and here, in 1998, there were more reprints of editions both old and new, the former comprising Waddell's Herodotus Book II," which, famously, opens with verse from Andrew Lang (1888) and T. R. Glover (Burma, 1916) and the latter Seaford's outstanding Cyclops of Euripides 54 with its invaluable survey of satyric drama (1-48), on which see G&amp;R 32 (1985), 211. Another Bristol Classical Paperback, also dating from 1998, is Harrison's two-volume B The Law of Athens55 to which Douglas MacDowell has added a bibliography covering the years 1967-97. Although 'select' this list numbers well over sixty items and suggests the strong interest of recent years in the sociological/political aspect of the Athenian legal system. Austerity has given way to opulence or at least that was my initial reaction, and it stayed an abiding impression, when I picked up the 1998 fourth edition of the *Cambridge Latin Course Book 1.56 The colour photos of Pompeii are guaranteed to seize and to maintain the interest of pupils and the information conveyed is very much up to date: the Suburban Baths are there just to the right of the Porta Marina and a skeleton from the sea front at Herculaneum, a resin cast, and the dead from Pompeii's vineyard put in a ghostly appearance.
