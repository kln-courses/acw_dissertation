<plain_text><page sequence="1">PETROGLYPH COMPLEXES IN THE HISTORY OF THE COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION MARIAN W. SMITH THE CULTURES of the Columbia-Fraser region are commonly thought of as mere extensions of more northerly, typical Northwest Coast cultures despite the fact that various suggestions of influence from other directions have occasionally been made. Petroglyph types in this region are by no means ran- domly distributed, and it is possible to show on the basis of petroglyph and related material that local stylistic features are best seen as particular expressions of complexes manifested widely in the general area. The Columbia-Fraser region covers the lower reaches of the Columbia and Fraser drainage systems and the territory between them. Both rivers plunge precipitately from the mountains to the coastal plain, the Columbia at the Dalles and the Fraser through the canyon of the Fraser above Yale. The area consid- ered here lies entirely within the coastal plain west of these points (Fig. 1). It includes parts of northern Oregon and of southern British Columbia, and all of western Washington surrounding Puget Sound and adjoining waters. For the purposes of this paper the Olympic Peninsula, extreme western Washington, has been omitted. At the time of white contact, the area thus delimited was dominated by peoples speaking Coast Salish languages. A few Sahaptins had filtered into the southern part of the region from the east; small and isolated Athabascan groups may have occurred in the southwestern section; and the northwestern part of the region still held remnants of Chemakum-speaking peoples. These minorities were greatly outnumbered, however, by the Coast Salish, who also controlled the overwhelming proportion of the occupied territory. The villages of the Coast Salish were politically autonomous, and marked cultural differentiations appeared in local areas. Yet the underlying cultural traits were similar. The Columbia-Fraser region might, therefore, also be referred to as the Coast Salish area except for the fact that the Olympic Peninsula Salish and those to the north along the Straits of Georgia are not included in the region as geographic- ally defined here. The petroglyphs of this region have never been described, and the materials for a complete survey have, so far as I know, not been collected. Nevertheless, I obtained several illustrations of petroglyphs from the southern part of the VOL. 2, 1946 306</page><page sequence="2">PETROGLYPHS OF COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION FIG. 1. Map of the Columbia-Fraser region of Washington and British Columbia, showing the location of petroglyph sites. region while engaged in ethnological work there and during a recent field trip in the northern section1 ran across a petroglyph of quite different style and ethnological connotation. The contrast between the two led to consideration of the literature on the petroglyphs of the neighboring Dalles and middle Colum- bia River valley. I believe it is now possible to distinguish between three petroglyph complexes in the Columbia-Fraser region and to suggest something as to their cultural affinities. 1 The first of these trips, in 1935-36 and 1938, were financed by the Columbia University Council for Research in the Social Sciences. The last, in 1945, was a student trip under my direction financed by the Department of Anthropology of Columbia University. Appreciation also goes to Arthur C. Ballard, Ernest Bertelson, and Mrs A. E. Rendall for their interest and friendly help. 307</page><page sequence="3">308 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Strong and Schenck distinguished two types of petroglyph2 at the Dalles.3 The first (Type I) is the more common and composed of pictographs of con- ventional design, many of which are "circles with radiating arms, broken disks, scrolls and human figures with round heads, often with spread arms, and simply delineated bodies." The use of circles is outstanding in this type and there can be little doubt that they are similar in style to the incised, decorative stone figurines found in the same area.4 This type occurs throughout the middle Columbia valley and many of the examples along the Columbia are true petro- glyphs.5 The second type (Type II) is represented by true petroglyphs found principally in Petroglyph Canyon at the Dalles. These include a few elaborated anthropomorphic figures, some of which are shown on horseback, but consist primarily of realistically portrayed animals. The animals differ markedly from the style of the first type. Strong and Schenck find their closest approximation southward in the Great Basin and attribute them tentatively to Shoshonean migrants, probably Snake, in the era following the introduction of the horse. Petroglyphs of the southern part of the Columbia-Fraser region do not seem to be as plentiful as those of the Dalles and middle Columbia but they clearly belong to the same general style as Type I, discussed above (see Plate 10 and Fig. 2, and compare with Steward, Plate 12). Plate 10, A shows a petroglyph-marked boulder about 200 feet north of its original location on Mud Bay, southern Puget Sound. This photograph was taken looking south. A closer view of the same boulder is shown in Plate 10, B (photo- graphs by Arthur C. Ballard). Plate 10, C shows a similar boulder with multiple, less co6rdinated designs which is (or was) located near Victor dock on North Bay, southern Puget Sound (photo- graph by Arthur C. Ballard). Figure 2 shows the petroglyph markings on a boulder off Agate Point near Squamish across from Seattle on the western shore of Puget Sound. The boulder 2 A distinction was made in the earlier literature between petroglyphs or incised rock figures and pictographs or painted rock figures. Recently, however, Steward (Petroglyphs of the United States, p. 405) has found it preferable to "designate all designs and figures on rocks petroglyphs (literally rock glyphs) and to reserve pictograph for that primitive type of writing in which objects and events are represented pictorially on all kinds of materials." This paper follows Steward's usage except where the materials under discussion have been otherwise described by other authors, as for instance the Dalles figures. But it is to be noted that Cressman (Petro- glyphs of Oregon) found the earlier distinction valuable. 3 Strong and Schenck, Petroglyphs Near the Dalles.

''*. \' \ I FIG. 2. Petroglyph markings on a boulder off Agate Point, near Suquamish, Puget Sound. Contact between the Columbia and southern Puget Sound was made via the Cowlitz-Nisqually prairie, and the cultures of southern Puget Sound bore striking resemblances to those of the northern shores of the Columbia up as far as the Dalles. Despite the gap in published petroglyph material for the lower Columbia, there seems little question that the southern Columbia-Fraser petro- glyphs and those of the Dalles-middle Columbia, Type I, form part of a single continuous distribution. A petroglyph of different style (Plate 11, A and B) comes from the northern part of our region and from the most northern point in inland Coast Salish territory. Kaiyama or the "Little Doctor" is on Doctor's Point on the west shore of Harrison Lake, British Columbia. Plate 11, B is a close-up of the petroglyph. Plate 11, A shows the log jam which has formed at its base: the rock wall goes straight down below water level (photo- graphs by Mrs A. E. Rendall). A stream just north of this point once supported a village of Coast Salish related to the people at the southern part of the lake. North of this lay the territory of the Lower Lillooet, an Interior Salish people with villages along the 309</page><page sequence="7">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Lillooet River to its mouth and the present site of Douglas at the head of Harri- son Lake. The petroglyph covers a natural rock formation shaped like a headed figure. The body and face are painted solidly with red ochre, the upper part of the head (or hat ?) and the single eye are done in white, the center of the eye and the symmetrical design on the body are splotches of black. No outlines other than the natural silhouette are indicated and the colors are applied in solid masses with no attention to realistic detail. Yet the impres- sion given by the petroglyph is decidedly anthropomorphic. l \a b c d I e FIG. 3. Outlines of tops of power boards, as described by a Suquamish informant. In general style this petroglyph seems reminiscent of the power boards used in the soul recovery ceremony of the central Puget Sound area. These were made of planks with a sharpened end to stick in the ground and a simply cut top (see Plate 11, C and D). Plate 11, C shows one of a pair of boards made by a Snoqualmie for Arthur C. Ballard (photograph by Mr Ballard). Plate 11, D also shows Snoqualmie boards: in this case set up as for the soul recovery ceremony (which was, of course, always performed indoors), in conjunction with the small anthropomorphic carvings and painted poles used at the same ceremony (photograph given me by Jerry Kenum of Tolt, Washington). The total effect of these boards is not particularly anthropomorphic but the cut tops are known as "heads" and bands of cedar bark are often placed around the "necks." So far as I know, all existent boards are of the shape illustrated. But a Suquamish informant reported that he had seen other shapes in use (see Fig. 3).6 Figure 3,a might be considered somewhat anthropomorphic and the tops of those in Plate 11 might be interpreted as bird heads. The boards are always made in pairs, and they are occasionally referred to as male and female. In any case, they afford a simple outlined form used as a surface for painting. It is to be particularly noted that only one side of the board is painted (see Plate 11, D). Boards of this type occur only in the central Puget Sound area among the Suquamish, Duwamish, Snoqualmie, Snohomish, and Skykomish. In the south- ern Puget Sound area, the Puyallup-Nisqually performed the soul recovery ceremony but without the use of power boards. On the other hand, the Nisqually 6 The author's fieldnotes, 1938; see also Waterman, Paraphernalia, pp. 295-300, Fig. 50. 310</page><page sequence="8">PETROGLYPHS OF COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION placed boards which were cut square across the top within the houses of shamans and these were "painted in red on one side 'to show a man'."7 The use of painted boards is also reported from the neighborhood of the Dalles. In 1811 Ross Cox saw grave boards "carved and painted with rude representations of men, bears, wolves and animals unknown. Some in green, others in white and red and all most hideously unlike nature."8 Scouler reports canoe burial some fourteen years later and the "canoes are in some instances ornamented with feathers and boards painted with rude resemblances of the human figure."9 With a minimum of realistic detail the petroglyph of the Little Doctor manages to give an overwhelmingly dynamic impression. The very constraint of the simple silhouette seems to lend power to the anthropomorphic concept. The power boards illustrated here (Plate 11, C and D) were made when Puget Sound culture and art had already deteriorated, yet their outline suggests something of the same dynamic quality. A like quality is presented with even greater intensity by the simple outline figures of certain petroglyphs found in Barrier Canyon, Utah.10 These are painted in solid red ochre and are larger than life size. No realistic details are incised or painted, but the whole suggests a headed, heavily shrouded anthropomorphic figure. These petroglyphs are so amazingly impressive that they are often referred to by such phrases as "godlike." Strong1l has emphasized the presence on the Columbia of an art style which portrays ribs within an anthropomorphic figure, and, coupled with the solidly painted Utah petroglyphs, appears at least one figure of the same silhouette with splotches of paint which might well be interpreted as ribs.12 These are also reminiscent of the symmetrical splotches on the body of the Little Doctor, although the latter would not ordinarily be regarded as a ribbed figure. The Utah petroglyphs also include two different, though apparently related, forms. The first is composed of small, solidly painted figures with line excre- scences representing arms and legs.13 These seem to be filled-in line drawings and their total effect is lively but delicate. Because of their resemblance to certain pottery decorations of the early Southwest, these are sometimes referred to as of Basket Maker date or origin. The second style is composed of squarely built figures with accentuated waists, done in outline with a wealth of realistic detail.14 7 Smith, Puyallup-Nisqually, pp. 114-115. 8 Cox, Adventures, p. 125. 9 Scouler, Journal, p. 280. 10 Steward, Plate 4, b; Douglas and d'Harnoncourt, Indian Art, p. 25. 11 Strong, Occurrence and Wider Implications. 12 Steward, Plate 4, b. 13 Steward, Plate 4, a. 14 Steward, Plates 3 and 5; Douglas and d'Harnoncourt, Fig. 31. The latter publication calls all of the three Utah styles mentioned here "Basket Maker." 311</page><page sequence="9">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The faces are drawn; the heads are complete with earrings and hair; and the bodies are clothed with costume detail. They utterly lack any dynamic quality. The general square effect of many of these figures, plus their interest in elaborate costume, strongly suggests modern katchina figures of the Southwest. One is tempted to erect an historical sequence for these Utah petroglyphs: Basket Maker is known to be early, and from its art style developed two currents, one of which moved south and is represented today in the Pueblo katchinas and the other of which moved north and was represented in the historic period by the painted boards of the Columbia River and Puget Sound. Such a reconstruc- tion is tempting, but petroglyph material remains almost impossible to date, and, as stated, the reconstruction is too simple to be of much use in unraveling the intricate path of events which connects the Southwest and the Northwest. The most that may be said on the basis of this petroglyph material alone is that there existed in Utah at least three related but distinct art styles which tie in in some manner with the art forms of adjoining areas. Fortunately, in dealing with historic materials we need not depend solely on petroglyphs. We know, for instance, the place which the Little Doctor holds in the thought of the people of Harrison Lake. It stands facing the narrowest part of the lake where the water is always rough no matter how calm it be above and below Doctor's Point. This is also the deepest portion of the lake and represents the greatest hazard in lake travel. In passing, the Indians used to throw a bit of food or some small article into the water from their canoes; today vacationists send nickels and dimes overboard from fishing boats and pleasure launches. Stories of the power of Kaiyama are well-known by Indian and white alike. It is said that a "white fellow" once gave whiskey to the Little Doctor, who then got drunk, and the lake was stirred into great waves. Once a priest going past Doctor's Point said "Kaiyama is nothing." So he did not feed Kaiyama and he did not let the Indian canoe-man feed him. Great waves came up and "the father cried like hell." The Indian said, "Pray, father." But the priest "forgot all about the church and cried till they got ashore."'1 The origin of the Little Doctor goes back to a power duel between a man and woman in which the man had the final say: "You cannot beat me for I will be a rock and all the people who come after us will see me."16 That this is no new explanation may be suggested by the fact that a somewhat similar tale was 15 Fieldnotes of Robert Hill, 1945. 16 Ibid. 312</page><page sequence="10">PETROGLYPHS OF COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION 313 recorded by Boas fifty years earlier: 1 Qals had a power duel with Shai who lived on the north end of Harrison Lake, and after a series of events Qals killed Shii and turned the various parts of his body to stone. Many natural features in Coast Salish territory, especially rock formations and islands, are said to have originated through the deeds of the Changer (Qals in the story above). At some places he rested and the marks of his feet or his body are still visible, at other places he turned people to stone. Thus, Mount Cheam just south of Harrison Lake has a large peak and four smaller ones which were originally a woman and her four daughters. As one woman said, "I've never been able to see but four peaks altogether but there must be five because the story says there are five."18 These tales of the origin of natural features occur among all the Coast Salish. Each landscape has its own mythology. Yet in all these, one element remains constant: the natural features are completely natural, they are not marked by incising or paint or any other mark of man. The Little Doctor, therefore, does not actually belong with such landmarks and it may well be that the story recorded by Boas refers to other natural fea- tures of northern Harrison Lake and not, specifically, to the Little Doctor. It will be remembered that the Boas story refers to the formation of several fea- tures, not to one alone, but the exact description of these is omitted. Much more significant is the clear tie of the Little Doctor to the power duels of historic personalities, a man and a woman. Such duels were important expressions of the religious beliefs of the Coast Salish,19 and the whole behavior of Kaiyama, confounding the priest and causing waves in his drunkenness, is of the sort which would be quite typical of a person having exceptional supernatural power. The power boards of central Puget Sound also have a strong relation to the supernatural. The soul recovery ceremony in which they were used was the most spectacular ceremony of the Coast Salish. In it a number of shamans participated, and each human actor "took along" his supernatural helpers, which were represented by small carved figures20 and by boards. Thus, each shaman made his own power boards and they were of supernatural aid to him only. During the ceremony the boards were seen to move and the "canoe" in which the shamans journeyed to the land of the dead in order to recover the stolen soul was said to be formed by the boards. Only models of power boards exist in 17 Boas, Indianische Sagen, p. 21. 18 Fieldnotes of Helen Codere, 1945. 19 Smith, Puyallup-Nisqually, p. 61. 20 Paul S. Wingert has recently completed a detailed study of Coast Salish wood sculpture.</page><page sequence="11">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY our museums today, for the real boards, like other power objects, were aban- doned after use or between ceremonies.21 Instances are told of these abandoned objects "calling out" to persons who pass by. The boards reported from Nisqually, farther south, were also identified with the powers of individual shamans, and one informant told how his uncle's boards chased him in his sleep: "I ran and those boards chased me."22 Farther south at the Dalles, Strong and Schenck report that the naturalistic petroglyphs, Type II, were said by "the older men of the Wishram Indians" to represent "the 'spirit' (or power) of the artist."23 But the report continues that "they made no distinction between the unique petroglyphs of the canyon and the much more abundant and apparently more ancient pictographs which characterize all the rim rock borders of the vicinity" (Type I). They also quote Sapir24 to the effect that in a Wasco village at the Dalles a man "made pictures on the rocks to amuse the youngest child-pictures of deer, birds and weapons." In illustrating a petroglyph of Type I from southern Hoods Canal, Mallery quotes Eells to the effect that it was "made by a man who felt very badly and went and sat on the rock and with another stone hammered out the eyes and nose."25 But the report goes on to say that for a time the Indians "believed that if the rock were shaken it would cause rain." Pictures made on rocks to amuse children or to fill idle moments would have no identification with religious power. Yet the situation remains unclear for the Dalles and Hoods Canal. Ethnological inquiry might clarify the point. Cer- tainly, the situation among the Coast Salish of Puget Sound is quite clear: all petroglyphs (Type I) were the work of children or of "long ago" adults and in neither case was there any religious significance.26 The Suquamish boulder (Fig. 2) was said to have been marked by Kitsap, a famous Suquamish warrior long dead, and Sam Wilson, a Suquamish, said in 1941 that once he too "put his mark on it."27 Sam Wilson never used such a phrase in describing religious power. In 1938 he was seen to decorate a bone knife handle with a design com- posed of circles with dots in their centers. The design certainly carried no religious meaning. At that time he said such designs were used by gamblers to mark their gambling bones. This is completely corroborated for the southern 21 Smith, Puyallup-Nisqually, p. 116. 22 Idem., p. 120. 23 Strong and Schenck, Petroglyphs Near the Dalles, p. 86; parentheses mine. 24 Sapir, Wishram Texts, pp. 242-243. 25 Mallery, Picture-Writing, p. 485. 26 Smith, Puyallup-Nisqually, p. 186. 27 Communication from Ernest Bertelson. 314</page><page sequence="12">PETROGLYPHS OF COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION Sound where gambling bones "were incised with patterns composed of simple circles and of circles with dots in their centers."28 These designs bore no implica- tions of religious power but were used so the gambler could quickly recognize the presence of an unfamiliar bone in his set. In direct contrast to this, the animals painted in semi-realistic style on the power boards of the central Sound (Plate 11, C and D) were patterned after supernatural powers. Thus, a shaman who "had" a one-eyed bear "for power" would paint a one-eyed bear on his board. Alice Cross, a Duwamish informant who worked with Arthur C. Ballard, told of a boulder which stood near Youngs- town adjoining West Seattle. She spoke of various animals pecked on the rock and related them definitely to power figures. The first person to mark the boulder was the father of one of her older contemporaries and, like the Suquamish boulder, it was used by more than one person. A semi-realistic style may, there- fore, also appear here as a petroglyph style, although no examples are available. In the same way, any Indian of the northern Sound who "had a power" could paint it on inside house wall or post. The present "totem pole" at Swinomish is an excellent example of this. The pole was made by a Sammish in imitation of northern totem poles. It carries a series of separated, semi-realistic animals and anthropomorphic figures carved in low relief. The figures are generally painted in solid color and bear no artistic relation to each other. Each represents the "power" of a "power person" of the reservation. It was only in such terms that the Salish of Puget Sound could make any sense out of a totem pole. Artistically and conceptually the Swinomish pole is about as far removed from a true totem pole as it could be. Yet its animals, like those of the power boards, represent individual powers and have strong religious connotations. The semi-realistic animals of the Dalles, Type II, were attributed by Strong and Schenck to Shoshoneans from the Great Basin of Utah and Nevada where petroglyphs of similar type occur. Cressman reports numerous petroglyphs of the same style from Oregon. It now appears that the Coast Salish of northern and central Puget Sound used semi-realistic animals of somewhat similar type. At least for the northern Sound these appear to be fairly recent adaptations to northern influence. The question then becomes whether semi-realistic figures at the Dalles should be connected with petroglyphs to the south or board paint- ings to the north. It will be noted that none of the references to semi-realistic figures claim any great antiquity for them. They seem indeed to belong to the historic period, i. e. after white contact, and just preceding it. Influences from 28 Smith, op. cit., p. 211. 315</page><page sequence="13">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY the Plains certainly entered the prairie lands of the plateau and coastal plain with the introduction of the horse. Semi-realistic decorative drawings may well have been among them. It seems best, therefore, for the present to recognize two possible sources of semi-realistic figures at the Dalles: one from the south and east via prairie land routes and one in response to northern influence via the more usual water routes. The former of these held little or no religious feeling and the latter was deeply religious. I suspect that the semi-realistic petroglyphs described by Strong and Schenck (Type II) are, as they suggested, related to the first of these, and that the grave boards described by Cox, Scouler, and others tie with the second and are slightly older. Such a situation would account for the apparent confusion of the Indians at the Dalles in regard to the signifi- cance of semi-realistic figures. It will be remembered that no mention of semi-realistic animal figures is made for southern Puget Sound. Personal contacts between central and northern Puget Sound and Vancouver Island were relatively common in the early historic period. Throughout the Columbia-Fraser region semi-realistic figures, where they occur, are related to concepts of individual, religious power, and the southern influence toward non-religious, semi-realistic figures seems not to have pene- trated beyond the Dalles. Classical Northwest Coast art of the historic period was highly conventionalized, and, although realistic animals are known from the archaeological period in the northern part of our region, they were always carved dishes, etc., of no known religious meaning and quite unlike the rude board paintings under discussion. It seems probable, therefore, that the semi- realistic, religiously-weighted figures of the Columbia-Fraser region were not directly derived from the north. They seem rather to be, as they have previously been called here, "responses" to only half-understood northern influence and to have stopped short of southern Puget Sound. Contacts were also established along the Pacific Coast by travelers from the north. A second stream of northern influence toward semi-realism may, therefore, have journeyed along the Pacific coast and up the Columbia River and be at least partially responsible for the painted grave boards at the Dalles. It is to be noted, however, that anthropomorphically painted boards are mentioned by Scouler. Types similar to the anthropomorphic Nisqually shaman boards may here have been used as grave boards. Apparently the use of grave boards was more general at the Dalles than the practice of painting semi-realistic animals upon them. Grave boards were used in the north by the Nooksack and Fraser River people. They were not used by any of the other people of our region. Unfortunately, it is not clear how the northern grave boards were decorated. 316</page><page sequence="14">PETROGLYPHS OF COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION All grave boards in our area, however, would probably be freighted with religious implications. The dominant art interest of the Columbia-Fraser region was in anthropomor- phic figures, and these, as well as the carved animal or bird heads sometimes used (see poles in Plate 11, D), were highly conventionalized. Many of these became so stylized that they were almost entirely geometric in form but they remained completely anthropomorphic in concept. The best known examples were the large drumming sticks of southern Puget Sound29 and the skwedilitch boards of the northern Sound.30 A ceremonial object of this sort was the seat of great supernatural power. It could be used at the will of its owner to confound sceptics, to run with them till they were exhausted, to drag them through fires, to carry them out into the Sound. Stories are told of men who were drowned when the great animated drumming sticks pulled them into deep water. At other times such objects were the seats of a power which acted without the volition of their owners; they moved; they talked; they "wanted to play." The drumming stick was anthropomorphic in concept whether one end was carved as a human head or not. The skwedilitch board was painted with splotches of solid color, it was shaped but not carved-it was nonetheless active and powerful. The power boards were equally anthropomorphic in concept. And it is impossible not to put Kaiyama, who confounded the sceptical priest, in the same category. The artistic interest could be satisfied by extremely simple lines giving the merest suggestion of living form but the observer knew the objects to be dynamically motivated. As has been seen, petroglyphs of similar, simple line occur in Utah. So far as I know, similar forms do not occur to the north. The Utah petroglyphs are prehistoric; the power boards were used in the historic period; Kaiyama, or the Little Doctor, receives donations today. These apparently represent an artistic-religious complex of prime significance to the Coast Salish, of considerable antiquity, and of southern affiliation. Petroglyphs of Type I remain to be discussed. They are highly convention- alized and frequently anthropomorphic. The basic design element is the circle or the circle (or dot) within a circle. In the southern part of our region, religious meaning is consistently denied to petroglyphs of Type I, and decorative or non-religious designs based upon the circle and dot appear in the historic period on small objects of bone. Circle and dot designs are widespread along the coast and to the north. Smith and Spier report circle and dot designs from 29 Smith, Puyallup-Nisqually, pp. 113, 118. 30 Haeberlin and Gunther, Indians of Puget Sound, Plate 1, b; Smith, Puyallup-Nisqually, p. 114; Coast Salish, p. 205; Waterman, Paraphernalia, p. 544, Fig. 147. 317</page><page sequence="15">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY Alaska to northern California and concluded from their study that the design "is more clearly characteristic of the Indians of the Northwest" than of the far north.31 Cressman reports a curvilinear petroglyph style from southeastern Oregon.32 This southeastern Oregon style is, however, combined with naturalis- tic and rectilinear designs and is particularly deficient in large anthropomorphic figures. It is, indeed, quite impossible to confuse it with our distinctive Type I. Since the curvilinear Oregon style seems not to occur in the Columbia-Fraser region its only interest for us is to document the presence of another curvilinear petroglyph style in the area of the circle and dot design distribution. Petroglyphs of Type I at the Dalles are designated by Strong and Schenck as "apparently more ancient" than those of Type II. They have also been related to a late prehistoric art style, found on small bone or stone plaques known only archaeologically and in the general Dalles and middle Columbia area, the favorite motif of which, as in the petroglyphs, is anthropomorphic. Although it is clear that both petroglyphs and bone incising were regarded as purely deco- rative in the southern part of our region in the historic period, the situation is not so clear for this older material. Petroglyphs in southern Puget Sound were attributed in part to "long ago" Indians. The problem becomes one of assigning meaning to archaeological materials. The strong tendency toward anthropo- morphism suggests our widespread religious complex. Yet the artistic style is quite different. The fact that the plaques were perforated and were apparently worn would lead toward a belief in their purely decorative character, for costume is seldom of the primary religious interest in our region that it is in classical Northwest Coast. The style also appears on a mortar. I know of no single instance in this whole area where a receptacle, dish, or mortar holds important religious significance. Until more is known of the archaeological culture of the middle Columbia, it seems best, therefore, to regard the Dalles petroglyphs and art styles as decorative rather than religious. The anthropomorphic, circle-motif petroglyphs (Type I) and the related art style have been said to bear certain resemblances to highly developed Northwest Coast conventional art. Objects of Northwest Coast manufacture, especially whale bone clubs with conventionalized human or bird heads, have been found archaeologically along the middle Columbia. There are no indications that travelers from the areas of classical Northwest Coast reached this region, so one assumes the clubs were trade objects. They could have passed by either of the two main trade routes, the first of which has already been suggested as a sec- 31 Smith and Spier, Dot and Circle Design, p. 47. 32 Cressman, Petroglyphs of Oregon, pp. 70-71. 318</page><page sequence="16">NORTH-SOUTH DISTRIBUTION OF PETROGLYPH COMPLEXES Complex I Complex II Complex III Circle motif Semi-realistic Anthropomorphic Decorative Decorative Religious Religious Harrison Lake petroglyph, etc. (grave boards) Northern Puget "totem pole" skwedilitch, etc. Sound house posts skwedilitch Central Puget petroglyph painting on power boards Sound bone incising house boards drumming sticks, etc. Southern Puget petroglyph drumming sticks, etc. Sound bone incising shaman boards Dalles of (petroglyph) (petroglyph) (grave boards) grave boards, etc. Columbia River (bone and stone art) Utah petroglyph petroglyph 0 0 rl 0 w Z CD V] ?x w I." c0</page><page sequence="17">SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY ondary route for transmission of a possible northern influence toward semi- realism: (1) Canoes are known to have made the journey along the Pacific coast from Vancouver Island to the mouth of the Columbia River, and the Lower Chinook bore marked signs of this contact. Trading was usual along the Columbia: objects of Northwest Coast manufacture could easily have passed upriver. (2) Contacts also reached from the eastern side of Vancouver Island to the Fraser River and from its upper drainages overland to the Columbia. This is a long circuitous route, but trade could be carried out completely by village-to- village exchange. I suspect this route between classical Northwest Coast and the middle Columbia to be the older of the two. If study of the Columbia Valley art style bears out a relationship between it and Northwest Coast, the contact may well have been established through trade objects and through these alone. Petroglyphs of Type I, therefore, may have developed out of some older circle-and-dot style in response to an artistic stimulus received from northern trade objects. Such a derivation of middle Columbia art would likewise tend to sub- stantiate its purely decorative character. The accompanying table has been drawn up to make our reconstructions more readily available. For purposes of clarity the important artistic-religious complex has been labeled Complex III, and the first descriptions of Types I and II, which have now been considerably expanded, have been called respectively Complexes I and II. Traits in parentheses in the table indicate those about which the situation is least clear. The complexes as discussed may now be summarized: Complex I is a decorative complex based upon the circle-motif, including petroglyphs and work on small objects of wood, bone, and stone. It is historic in central and southern Puget Sound except possibly for the petroglyphs, which may belong with the late prehistoric aspect of the complex as it appears at the Dalles. This more ancient aspect includes rather striking anthropomorphic figures and may tie with Complex III. The bulk of evidence indicates, however, that it had no significant religious ties. Complex II covers the semi-realistic representation of animal figures and apparently has two aspects, in one of which the figures had religious meaning while in the other they did not. The decorative aspect probably came from Nevada and Utah, reaching Oregon in the period after the introduction of the horse and not extending much farther north than the Dalles. The religious aspect arose in the historic period probably through a misinterpretation by the Coast Salish of northern ceremonial and art forms. Complex III is found throughout the Columbia-Fraser region and shows 320</page><page sequence="18">PETROGLYPHS OF COLUMBIA-FRASER REGION development into numerous highly specialized localizations. It has affiliations inland and to the south which are apparently prehistoric. It is strongly anthropo- morphic, involving an essentially simple outline form, which ties with the deepest religious beliefs of the Coast Salish. In conclusion we may say that a basic religious-artistic complex with apparent southern affiliations was affected locally and in a late period by an artistic semi- realism of northern derivation. A decorative complex based on circles and dots can also be distinguished but cannot be related to the religious-artistic complex.
