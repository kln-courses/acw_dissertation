<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barbara Harrell Carson "I have heard [. . .] things Grow": Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel1 What would it have looked like- that "fresh, green breast of the new world/' as Scott Fitzgerald called it, just before the first Europeans stepped ashore? What would English settlers have seen a little more than a century later when they walked to the edges of their villages or stepped into the forests or traveled by waterway from town to town? When modern readers, hoping for answers to such questions, turn to accounts of early Europeans in the Americas, they are likely to be puzzled and frustrated by the dearth of specific descriptions: face-to-face with a strange new land, the newcomers painted in broad strokes. So, Columbus's letters home speak of islands "very fertile to a limitless degree," harbors "beyond comparison," "many rivers, good and large," and "very lofty mountains [ - ] most beautiful, of a thousand shapes, and all [. . .] accessible" (35). One hundred years later, the French geographer Samuel de Champlain and the English adventurer John Smith reported the wonders of North America in equally sweeping (and equally utilitarian) terms. The bays and coasts, Champlain exclaimed, were "filled with every kind of fish" as well as "plenty of shellfish of several kinds, and especially oysters" (95). Here, Smith promised potential immigrants, they would find "unknown parts" - "woods, lakes, and rivers"- ready to yield their abundance to "fowling and fishing, [. . .] hunting and hawking" (117).

Instead of a satanic domain, the Massachusetts forests and fields were, for Morton, a kind of generalized, though vastly expanded and decidedly sensual, formal garden, with "goodly groves of trees, dainty fine round rising hillocks, delicate fair large plains, sweet crystal fountains, and clear running streams [. . .], jetting most jocundly where they do meet, and hand in hand run down to Neptune's court" (198). Readers looking a century ahead and hoping that the emerging genre of the novel would provide details about the American environment not available in well-known works of non-fiction are likely to turn to Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719), set off the coast of South America. Disappointingly, Defoe's descriptions are as generalized as Columbus's or Champlain's. When the shipwrecked Crusoe sets out to "survey" his island, ten months after his arrival, he does little more than list what he sees: "a little brook," "many pleasant savannahs," "a great deal of tobacco," "several sugar-canes," "melons upon the ground," "grapes upon the trees," an "abundance of cocoa-trees, and orange, lemon, and citron trees" (94-95; ch. 7). After this quick sketch to establish a vaguely tropical setting, Defoe does little to evoke the location of Crusoe's adventure. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that as far as natural description is con- cerned, Crusoe might as well have spent those twenty-eight years on the Isle of Wight. The faintness of the evocations of nature in these familiar works of fiction and nonfiction and in the scores of others they typify makes all the more remarkable the vastly different treatment of the American environment to be found in a largely forgotten eighteenth- century novel by one William Williams (1727-91), a painter of por- traits and landscapes who spent something like thirty years in the American colonies, before returning to England in 1776.4 Probably completed, at least in draft, before his return (Dickason 70-75), Williams's one literary creation- Mr. Penrose : The Journal of Penrose , Seaman- could arguably claim the title of first American novel.5 While bowdlerized versions appeared in England in 1815 and in 1825 (and a pirated German translation in 1817), the novel was not</page><page sequence="3">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 479 published in its original form until 1969, after the late David Howard Dickason, of Indiana University, rediscovered the original manuscript (Dickason 57, 188-206). Like Defoe's famous tale, Williams's work tells the story of a cast- away English sailor. Lewellin Penrose spends twenty-seven years on a Caribbean shore, where he keeps a journal recording experiences, values, and attitudes very unlike Crusoe's. In vivid contrast to Defoe's hero, Penrose redefines his concept of wealth; learns to love and respect the natives of the place; becomes the center of a small, harmonious community composed of Indians, stray and outcast Europeans, and an escaped slave; and experiences dramatic shifts in his philosophical and religious ideas as a consequence of all his encounters with the alien Other. He falls in love with and marries a native girl, has a son, suffers his wife's death in childbirth, marries again, fathers more children; and repeatedly rejects the idea of return- ing to England because both duty and love bind him to his American family. Over the years, his little community, so generally serene when left to itself, finds its happiness increasingly threatened by civilization. The threat appears first in the form of drunken shipwrecked mari- ners, who bring murder to Penrose's utopia. Then rapacious traders ("from North America, either Pensilvania, New York, Maryland or New England" [296]) appear, and Penrose, using unearthed pirate treasure, purchases goods- including watches and beaver hats- that further complicate his life.6 And always, there is fear of being found by the Spanish- a fear that grows until life in Penrose's community is virtually paralyzed, the small group even temporarily splitting up. In a last gesture of connection with his homeland, he directs that on his death the manuscript of his journal be delivered into English hands- a request honored by his son in the final pages of the novel. What is most significant for the purposes of the present essay is that Mr. Penrose : The Journal of Penrose , Seaman vividly recreates, through its use of extraordinarily specific details, the natural world in which the protagonist moves. A few examples will serve at the outset to suggest how different Williams's treatment is from Defoe's, even on the most basic level. While there seem to be no mosquitoes, flies, spiders, wasps, or beetles on Crusoe's island, Penrose's Caribbean is well supplied with all their fascinating and irritating variety. Penrose records: "I had one great anoyance when naked of such a nature that I could but ill withstand, which was A Sort of fly called a Doctor fly. This Insect is about the size of our hive bee and shaped much like it, but its head is of a bright Saxon green. No sooner do they find an</page><page sequence="4">480 ISLE object than they dart at it and instantly make the Blood fly forth like a lancet touch" (110)7 He also writes about the "Monstrous Beetle" which gave "a terri- ble black Eye" to one of his friends: These Beetles I had seen frequently in the Woods in the Evenings. I have found them as large over as an hens Egg and of a dark green colour. They have a long kind of forceps like to the claw of a Crab set with teeth, and has a black polish so that nothing can be finer. With these forceps they lay hold on young twigs of trees such as they can grasp, then expanding their wings begin to whirl round the branch with great force or vel- ocity and by that means cut the bark through to ye Sap; then by hanging under they suck it in (167-68). And then there's the brown wasp, its nest composed of papery white "cells [. . .] ranged circularly one with in the other, so that it form'd one compleat spiral line" (223). And yet again, a "very odd" insect, being in length about four inches yet so slim in one part that it is not much thicker than a small thread. It has eight very long legs and two horns 6 inches in length tapering to such a small point that it is as fine as any cobweb in appearance. The whole Insect, wings and all, is of the fine hew of a watchspring, but what makes it singular is its smell, as no Rose can have a finer scent. It has the power to fold up those horns as in joynts or can at pleasure lay both horns at length back- ward in a direct line (223-24). The difference between the minute details in Williams's work (complete with evocations of the senses of sight, smell, and touch) and Defoe's "little brook," "many pleasant savannahs," "melons upon the ground," "grapes upon the trees" could not be more vivid. One immediate effect of the scores of specific descriptions of the natural world in Mr. Penrose is an overwhelming sense of the verisi- militude of the narrative.8 Indeed, William Williams's benefactor, to whom he gave the manuscript of his novel before his death, con- sidered it a true story of Williams's personal experiences; twentieth- century bibliographies continued to perpetuate the error (Dickason 77, 188-206); and even Dickason, Williams's modern editor and author of the perceptive book-length study of the novel, occasionally assumes parallels between the lives of Penrose and Williams for which there is no evidence.9</page><page sequence="5">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 481 The focus on the natural world and the convincing realism of its treatment in The Journal of Penrose , Seaman are all the more astonish- ing when we understand that Williams was writing before the publication of the works that would establish the genre of literary (as distinguished from scientific) nature writing. Crevecoeur's Letters from an American Farmer (1782), Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia (1 787), Gilbert White's letters about Selbourne, England (1789), William Bartram's account of his travels in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida, and southern Indian territories (1791)- considered founda- tional texts in the genre- all still lay in the future. This is not to claim that Williams arrived at his treatment of the natural world completely ex nihilo. Certainly, he could have found models of how to describe the natural world in the taxonomical and descriptive works of Linnaeus and his followers, and in the writings of seamen and trave- lers, such as Captain William Dampier's A New Voyage round the World (1697), his Voyages and Discoveries (1699), and Mark Catesby's The Natural History of Carolina , Florida , and the Bahama Islands (2 vol, 1731-43) (Dickason 100-137; Adams 133). However, Williams's achievement in Mr. Penrose belongs to an entirely different order. In service of his very different purposes, he no doubt turned to his extensive readings. Certainly, he called upon his memories- if not records- of his own observations from the year or so he spent painting in the Caribbean. But he had something else in his arsenal as well. He was a painter. And his artist's eye was accompanied by a rare ability to transfer, in pain- terly detail, the specifics of the natural world to the pages of a work of fiction. The result was the creation of a written work unlike any other of the time. The originality of The Journal of Mr. Penrose , Seaman lies first of all in its combination of nature obser- vation with fiction. Even more significant, however, is the degree of Williams's success in presenting those details, not as factual tidbits interrupting the fictional flow, but as integral components of the literary work, contributing to the development of the novel's plot, characters, and themes. That Williams is doing something with nature unlike Defoe is apparent in the examples above. That his strategies are also very unlike typical nature writing of the eighteenth century becomes apparent when we compare, as an example, the portrayals of crabs in his novel and in Mark Catesby's The Natural History of Carolina , Florida, and the Bahamas (1731-43). The comparison also demonstrates how Williams uses details about nature to serve literary ends, as dis- tinct from scientific or reportorial purposes. Catesby's commentary on the crabs reads:</page><page sequence="6">482 isle The Bahama-Islands as well as most Lands between the Tropicks, abound with these Animals, in some Places the Ground being almost covered with them, so thick they are, when out of their Holes that the Earth seems to move as they crawl about. If any one has a Stick in their Hand, they will not suffer themselves to be approached so near as without it, and if walking regardless amongst them without any Thing in Hand, they will approach you with menacing Gestures, and with one of their Claws raised threaten to attack you. They make their Holes like Rabbits in Candy Lands, in some of the mountainous Islands; they in breeding Time annually descend the Hills in vast Numbers to lay their Eggs near the Sea, whatever they meet with in their Passage they go over, never going aside let Houses, Churches or what will stand in their Way; They have been known to enter in at a Window, and on a Bed, where People who never before had seen any, were not a little surprized. They are of various Sizes, the largest about six Inches wide; they walk Side-ways like the Sea-Crab, and are shaped like them, some are black, some yellow, some red and others variegated with red, white, and yellow mixed. Some of these as well as the Fish of this Country are poisonous, of which several People have died, particularly of the black kind. The light-coloured are reckoned best, and when full in Flesh are very well tasted. In some of the Sugar Islands they are eat without Danger, and are no small help to the Negro Slaves, who on many of the Islands would fare very hard without them. They feed on Vegitables (II, 32). Lively, colorful, even slightly humorous in its description of the crabs' encounters with humans, the passage is, nevertheless, solidly focused on the crab: habitat, appearance, distinguishing behaviors, reproductive strategies, human utility. Penrose's treatment of the crab covers the same factual territory. It is, however, twice as long as Catesby's and is even more vividly specific. And it is something more besides. The journal entry begins: It happened one day as Somer [a Dutch sailor who joins Penrose's group after the justifiable killing of another sailor] and I were walking by the Shore near to some low flat rocks we had a curious scene of an</page><page sequence="7">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 483 Amour between two Sea Crabs, and as there are not 2 in 20,000 who ever happen to see the like I shall touch upon it. (Viz), I was sitting on a long stone perhaps 20 feet by 15 feet in length when a Crab came up the side of it and marched slowly toward the middle of it and there squated down. About one minute after that up came another on the opposite side (202). A lot has happened in these few lines. First, Williams has quickly painted the scene (near "low flat rocks" along the shore) in which his first-person narrator encounters the crab. In this, he not only allows us to see the action, but also makes clear that he is referring to one specific occasion rather summarizing general knowledge. This is a scene, not a zoological manual. And in this scene he locates both himself and the potential reader (he is sitting on this long stone viewing something that we- being one of the 19,998 uninitiated- have never seen). He also sweeps us in through his metaphor con- cerning crustacean "amours" (rather than the scientific "mating"), humorously linking human experience with that of the crab. All of this invites us to respond to this tale of an encounter with a crab more personally, more feelingly than pure intellect would allow. In short, we have been drawn into a fictional world. Complicating that world, Williams introduces another character, Penrose's friend Somer, who will later help transform a scene into something far beyond mere nature description. In these moves, Williams has done precisely what Thomas J. Lyons identifies as the first requirement for a literary, rather than scientific, treatment of nature. Rather than focusing solely on what Lyons terms "pointed instruction in the facts of nature," Williams has introduced humans experiencing the natural world- the narrator, his friend, even the reader (5). Before the segment ends, Williams makes even more vivid his achievement of the next stage in progression toward literary nature writing, which Lyons characterizes as "a clear emphasis on the writer's experience" (5). Of course, what we see in the case of Mr. Penrose is not the experiences of the writer of the novel, but of his fictional characters, who are deeply affected- intel- lectually, emotionally, and spiritually- by the world they observe. When this occurs in Mr. Penrose , nature, humanity, and the divine are brought into dizzying intersection. Williams begins this shift from the physical to the cosmic, however, with Penrose's feet planted firmly on the sand. He meticulously traces the choreography of the mating dance of the two crabs he has spied, noting the slow move- ment of the second crab, its full stop, its "Oblique" turning, the</page><page sequence="8">484 isle increase in speed of movement (until "his Velocity became so exceed- ing quick that the Eye could not catch the motion") (202). Then, he notes, "the Centre Crab constantly moved at the same time as fixed on a Swivel or pevit untili the male Crab became very nigh, when in an instant the female became willing to sit still, flang back the . . . [elision in text] and an union commenced" (202). This factual account is suddenly interrupted by an emotional outburst from Penrose's Dutch companion, who has stood by during their observation of the crabs with an "attitude [. . .] very expressive of admiration" (203). His arms extended, his "hands clenched," Penrose recounts, Somer "burstfs] into the following expressions: 'How crate is our Got vat mak all dem his tings. Shipmate, He is here, He is dare unt al over da vorld, unt dat show us He bin in dis lant mit us, dis minute" (203). This shift from observation of reality to an outpouring of religious conviction takes Mr. Penrose out of the territory occupied by natural historians of the period like Mark Catesby. Of course, while not the modus operandi of naturalists, this move from examination of nature to thoughts of God would have been as comfortable to Anne Bradstreet a century before Williams as to his contemporary eighteenth-century Enlightenment Deists.10 The difference is that Williams has brought this familiar experience into the world of fiction, combining narration of Somer's spiritual conviction with elaborate, specific descriptions of the details in the natural world responsible for that spiritual insight (far different from Bradstreet's "merry grasshopper" and "black-clad cricket"). In a subsequent outburst from Somer, Williams takes his treatment of nature in a different direction, showing yet another way that humans can experience the natural world. While in the previous case, Somer had detected evidence of God in nature, he now sees in nature a symbolic expression of his own spiritual state- a seemingly slight, but significant, shift. This insight of Somer's follows Penrose's account in his journal concerning land crabs, particularly their "won- derful" and inexorable march to the sea during mating season; the "frequent," "vicious" battles of the males ("giving each other such blows with their great claws that the sound may be heard twenty yards"); the escape of the weaker, when caught, by snapping off a limb at the joint; their great rapacity, extending even to bodies in coffins; the swiftness that puts them "out of human power to over- take them"; the deadliness of their threat to lizards, which know "by instinct that if they come but within a snatch of their claws there is no redemption" (203-4). While this passage is obviously a summary of Penrose's general knowledge of land crabs- the scene he and Somer personally</page><page sequence="9">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 485 witness involves just two mating sea crabs- Williams, in a narratological lapse, has Somer respond as if he has actually been watching the crabs' rapacity. Penrose records: "My friend Somer from this time fell into a kind of melancholy, and one day I asked him the cause of his dullness. 'Oh, my good friend,' said he, 'I am thinking of my wickedness'" (204). Somer's comment is puzzling, since there is no obvious, inherent connection between the factual description of the land crabs and his conviction of his wickedness, and Penrose offers no explanation of his friend's train of thought. Nevertheless, we can make it out. The imagery of bodies in coffins, of the crabs' unrelenting movement, of their swift, deadly, and inescapable assaults- all strike Somer as symbols of his spiritually lost condition and of the retributory hand of God. Here Williams presents the natural world in complex interplay with the psychic world. Moving outside conventional religious or cul- tural associations, he sees in nature the capacity to generate very per- sonal psychological responses, responses that transcend easy logic, but that speak, through their imagistic power, to another kind of knowing. In the next century, Washington Irving and Edgar Allan Poe (to say nothing of Thoreau among writers of non-fiction) would develop to something close to perfection that strategy of using nature both to evoke and to symbolize states of the human psyche. Penrose's responses during this scene, vividly different from Somer's, illustrate how Williams also uses reactions to nature to delin- eate his characters. In this crab-watching episode, Penrose answers Somer's first peroration on the ubiquity of God in measured, even stark, terms, compared with Somer's outburst: "'Most certain,' I said, 'His almighty Eye never slumbers. Therfore should not you and I watch also, messmate, that we may not forget we are ever in his holy view where ever may be our lot to be cast in this life?"' (203) He assents to Somer's main point about God's presence; he points the lesson applicable to himself and his friend. Then he abruptly returns to an examination of the natural world, declaring, in what surely strikes modern readers as a weak transition, "This naturally leads me to make some remarks on the other sort call'd Land Crabs" (203). The logic Penrose intends in his use of "naturally" no doubt lies in the fact that he is going to recount further evidence of God's presence. But the segue is clearly a stretch; his real interest here is not in God, but in crabs. Penrose continues his minute description for some thirty lines. Then when Somer breaks into his melancholy rumination on his wickedness, Penrose's reply demonstrates his unwillingness to linger over questions not belonging to studies appropriate to man.11 When</page><page sequence="10">486 isle Somer confesses that he is "thinking on my wickedness/' Penrose answers shortly, "So should we all" (204). When Somers objects that his reason is greater because he has killed a man, Penrose argues briefly that he thinks "the Great Judge" appointed Somer to mete out justice to the "Wretch" he killed (204). When Somers points out that the problem is complicated by the fact that he didn't give the dead man time to confess his sins, Penrose brings the whole discussion to a close: "Leave that reflection alone to the great Author of our being, and pray let us drop ye subject" (204). Indeed, from the early pages of the novel, Williams has used Penrose's responses to nature not only to signal his moral and psychological state, but to suggest his growth in those areas. Tellingly, Penrose's account of his years as a mariner before becoming a castaway contains only one description of the natural world beyond references to weather and sea conditions (and that exception involves his fellow privateers' shooting of flamingoes in the Florida Keys). His focus during this period is not on nature, but on prize money, revenge against the Spanish, and pleasures of the body. Given the pursuit of knowledge about nature that will characterize the life lying just ahead of him, it seems neatly ironic that his chasing a tortoise is what precipitates his entry into the natural world of the Caribbean. Penrose leaps drunkenly from his ship into a canoe to paddle after the promise of a tasty meal. Too drunk to reboard the ship, he falls asleep in the canoe, which, during the night, comes untethered from the vessel and brings him ashore on an island he later learns is off the coast of Nicaragua. The land before him is, at the outset, totally alien: "I [. . .] looked round me and could see nothing but a wild country [. . .]" (53). That sentence ends with the sorrowful declaration, "I knew not" (53). He is speaking of the question of whether the country is inhabited, but the emphatic placement of the three words suggests their larger sig- nificance: He stands in total ignorance before a yawning unknown. He could not be more fully other- "an utter stranger in this part of the world" (53). When he does, briefly, come into contact with three natives, he concludes immediately- and incorrectly- that they are "merciless Savages" (54). In his journal Penrose recalls the "despair," "desolation," "dolefull dumps," and agonizing loneliness marking his early days as a castaway (53-57). Soon, however, Penrose begins to experience the familiar American transformation: a developing sense of "psychic at-homeness" in an alien environment.12 Once he learns that he can count on having food from the sea and water from the well he digs in the sand, his relationship with nature begins to shift away from that</page><page sequence="11">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 487 of disconnected self facing a hostile other. The first message of nature is that God is providing for him; the second is that nature itself can bring solace, not only to the body, but also to the spirit and to the mind as well. A refreshing rain "quite rais'd my spirits"; he observes in wonder the "incredible number of Birds of many kinds [which] arose like clouds," creating a "noise [that] almost made me deaf"; pelicans fly so close that they brush his head; paddling down a creek, he discovers "Mangrove trees [. . .] laden with Oysters like traces of Onions"; the water there abounds "with fish of diverse kinds," and the trees are filled with "Spoonbills, Galldings, Cranes," which "sat on the trees without taking much notice of me." Penrose himself marks the change in his perspective: "I was so delighted with these new scenes that fear never once entered my noddle" (58). On this same excursion, an even larger sense of connection, a broader eco- logical awareness, comes to him when he discovers a carved mask and concludes, "[...] I am not the first of Mankind who have visited this place" (59). Here is a hint of a reality to become even clearer to Penrose as time goes on: he is part of an intricate web of life. This is not to imply that Penrose's initial fear before the natural world ends at once (he is even "alarmed [. . .] at first" when he is sur- prised by "a parceli" of young turtles "daddling over my fingers" [62-3]). Nor does Williams suggest that nature holds no justifiable terrors for Penrose. A shark follows his boat until he thinks to throws it a "conck" (63). The lush vegetation of his new home includes "several Manchiniel Trees whose fruit is deadly poison to Man" (69). Later, a wildcat kills a young woman who joins his community; a scorpion nearly bites his sleeping daughter; a whale kills a dear friend. Hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes, as well as treacherous seas further underscore Williams's refusal to romanticize nature as perennially benign. In spite of that reality, however, Penrose feels increasingly at home in his wilderness. One early strategy he uses to accomplish this is the familiar one of characterizing the natural world in human terms. Newly hatched turtles are "young gentery" (63); flamingoes he sees as "a large company of Soldiers all ranged in their regimentals" (64); mullet-like fish are scooped into the human net when Penrose humorously describes them as "Exceeding swift of finn" (93) and ants are similarly humanized by his comic declaration that "all their works are deeds of darkness"- a laughing reference to St. Paul's warning to the Ephesians (168; Ephesians 5:11). When Penrose cap- tures a fish-hawk, then a fawn, and later adds a monkey to his mÃ©nage, he names and anthropomorphizes them. Mr. Yellowbill and he "became very intimate, so far that when I came home he would</page><page sequence="12">488 isle salute me very kindly and I used to return the compliment" (68). Miss Doe acts as his companion in excursions and hunts. Jackko rides the family dog dressed in a jockey's cap and whip. Williams understands the impulse to relate to the animal world this way, particularly in the absence of human connections. For Penrose, Miss Doe is a gift from God sent "as an innocent amuser of my disconsolate hours" (77). Yet, the novel makes clear the complex- ity of Penrose's attitude toward nature by refusing to champion a romantic erasure of boundaries between the species. Yellowbill dies when Penrose forgets him as he flees to higher ground during the wet season; Miss Doe is killed and eaten by Penrose after a wildcat mangles her beyond recovery; and Jackko is drowned on Penrose's order when he upsets a pot of boiling water on Penrose's son. After Penrose is joined by the Indians who become his wife and brother-in-law, after he has children, and after others join his commu- nity, Penrose's rhetoric and attitude toward the natural world shifts again. Now inhabiting an environment made less fearful by famili- arity and less lonely by human connection, he moves away from anthropomorphic descriptions and treatment of animals- a strategy that served him well in the initial stages of learning to be at ease in his new world. With this growing at-homeness, Penrose increasingly sees the world around him in its fascinating naturalness rather than as a blurred reflection of humanity. Free of daily fear for his mere sur- vival, free of loneliness, he is now also free to see and to appreciate nature qua nature. A sense of sheer wonder often accompanies his descriptions of this world, none more moving than the following: "And now speak- ing of these long rains I shall observe they come on twice a year, but most about October, and then hold on with but few intervals 3, 4 or 5 Week more or less. And on an Evening when it would hold up a little, Mirriads of Fire Flies then swarmed in the air twinkling like so many Stars. And of a serene night when all was hushed I have heard the things Grow" (189). However, in the very next sentence, Penrose leaves behind this lyrical mood to resume the more detached voice of the naturalist: "Several times Somer has cut a tuft of grass for that end, and we have found it sprung 3 inches in perhaps 30 hours time. The most disagreeable thing at this Season was a kind of tree Toad whose noise was the most doleful that can be concieved" (189). As the years go by and Penrose's ease in his Caribbean world grows, his deepening interest in nature expresses itself in increasingly detailed descriptions. (Significantly, toward the end of the work, when his ease is disrupted by fear that the Spanish will come looking for the pirate treasures he has unearthed, such descriptions come</page><page sequence="13">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 489 virtually to an end. For Williams, leisure and freedom from fear for survival are preconditions for deep appreciation of the environment.) Penrose becomes known in his small community for his love of "curi- osities," which his companions repeatedly bring for his study.13 Sounding less like the astonished traveler of the early part of the journal and more like a dedicated naturalist, Penrose emphasizes again and again that what he reports is absolute truth, based on his own personal observation. He spends twenty-three lines describing small hanger birds; fifty-two lines on crabs; twenty-nine on dung beetles. His explanation of why he has been able to see such details, overlooked by so many others, sounds for all the world like Thoreau's "I have traveled a good deal in Concord." Penrose writes: "[. . .] perhaps many things which [. . .] have been seen and described by my pen have never been noticed by any others before. The reason is obvious: they keep moving from place to place and perhaps give themselves little concern to explore the beauties of this Universe, When on the contrary I remain as a Man consigned over to such a purpose, with time sufficient to answer all such ends" (267-68). In this declaration, we see that Penrose's attentiveness to nature has taken on yet another kind of importance in his life. Initially a necessity for survival, then a way to ease his alienation in a presum- ably hostile environment, and later still a consuming intellectual pursuit, focus on the natural world now gives him a raison d'etre , setting this "Illiterate Sailor," "a man of no Education," above "the lerned" in his knowledge of the world around him (267). His is an aristocracy of the observant, marked not by wealth and status, but indeed created by freedom from the demands of possessions and position. Penrose has learned the principle that Thoreau would enun- ciate in the next century: time is the true currency of life, and Penrose sees his life as full of riches. Delighted "to have so much leasure to Contemplate" the wonders around him, Penrose pushes beyond enjoyment of isolated curiosities and on toward insights into the system of nature itself (316). Just how remarkable this perspective is for his time may be illuminated by our remembering its relative newness. Only in 1735 had Linnaeus pub- lished his Systema Naturae , followed in 1753 by Species Plantarum (we recall that Mr. Penrose was probably completed, at least in draft, by 1776). In these works, as Robert Finch and John Elder have explained, "Linnaeus introduced a framework within which all living things could be classified and identified" (19). True to this heritage, Penrose works persistently on classifying the abundant species around him: "two different sorts" of land crabs (203); "Pidgeons of Two sorts" (228); at least four varieties of spiders ("to give a discript of the many</page><page sequence="14">490 ISLE sorts would be too tedious" [308]); lizzards so numerous that he finally concedes that it is "beyond my power to discribe the whole genera of them" (284). And in that confession of inadequacy as well as in repeated declarations that he simply does not know the answer to many of nature's riddles, Penrose begins to sound, not like Linnaeus with his tidy hierarchies, but like Darwin standing before his tangled bank. (While Buffon's Historie Naturelle, with its challenge to the Christian idea of immutable species and its speculations on the Åimilarities of apes and humans had appeared in 1749, Darwin's Origin of Species was not to be published until 1859.)14 Viewing this complicated, sur- prising, perplexing, teeming world, Penrose records evidence of vari- ation within species, natural camouflage, displacement of species because of environmental changes, and even disappearance of species. He also stands bemused before mysterious life forms that chal- lenge his categories (sometimes he is not even clear whether he is examining a member of the plant or the animal kingdom). He puzzles, for example, over an insect that resembles a wasp physically, but differs in its "manner of [. . .] life [. . .] from that of all other Insects of that class" (224). He ponders marine animals that look like flowers (314). In the ocean shallows he comes upon "a curious bunch or Whipp of some living substance much resembling Catgut" or a "hand full of thread animated," so intricately interwoven that there was no discernible head or tail (266-67). On yet another occasion he finds "a sort of Insect or rather reptile creeping in ye Shallow Water, of a dark olive green full of black circles," advancing "in the manner our Sluggs do, dilating and contracting" and, when touched, "emit- ting] a most glorious purple liquid" (281). In the same waters, his friends discover a strange "Animal Substance in long round shapes of a brown hue Exceeding smooth and of a consistency like unto soft grissle" (313). Penrose also brings the fuzziness of species distinctions closer to home: The behavior of monkeys strikes him, he notes, as "conformable to the human species" (142). At these moments, Penrose stands face to face with the compli- cated, dynamic, living world of nature, always slightly beyond the human capacity to understand and to simplify. He might be an elder brother to Melville's Ishmael who a century later will struggle in vain to place all whales into neat, separate classes. Penrose's eventual ease in the face of the unknown also anticipates the perspective that Ishmael arrives at in Moby-Dick, when he warns that it may not be "prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout" (291). In the same spirit, when Penrose's</page><page sequence="15">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 491 dear friend Norman Bell is killed chasing a whale, Penrose condemns the pursuit as "Presumptive" (374), agreeing with his wife that Bell was "foolish mad to [. . .] Go catch what he could not catch" (376). Penrose has no desire to penetrate further into Mystery than Providence allows. Indeed, the very complexity and richness of nature make it easier to accept his lack of knowledge, even as they prod him to probe and discover. This surprisingly modern perspective on nature's complexity leads Penrose to his most significant insight: a recognition that all nature (including humanity) is linked in a dynamic system, one part intricately tied to another, in mutual influence. Williams underscores this central theme in a variety of references to mysterious webs of dependence and influence in the natural world. Penrose records, for example, his observation that butterflies increase spectacularly in number after earthquakes and notes that one quake seemed linked to the appearance of "swarms of Butterflys Of a new sort" (268, 372- 73). He writes of his discovery of "some kinds of Flowers [. . .] which have the quality of displaying their bloom after the Sun is set and keep so the whole Night through, untili day comes on, when they all close again. On the contrary, others open with the Rising Sun and close again as it sets in the Evening" (315). Shortly after this, he marvels at the link between the fruit of the bell pear (which varies in color from dark green at one end to purple at the other) and the pro- tective coloration of "a Small Bird who feeds on the seed of it [ ] And as the fruit varies or graduates from the Green to the Purple so changes the bird in its hue exactly, from its tail to the neck and head which terminates in purple so that when the Bird is actually on the limbs or fruit you can hardly know unless it should move or shift its place" (316). Another mysterious symbiosis causes him to exclaim: "But I must observe one thing truly remarkable and beyond my com- prehension, as follows. At times we found a kind of Brown Wasp which, falling head formost to the Ground from the Trees, there takes root, from whence springs up a small plant through their bodies" (269). As the last example suggests, this dynamic vision of nature includes an acknowledgement of the inextricable role of death in a thriving ecology. And Penrose knows that humans are included in this system. He describes the vultures who gather in growing numbers as his friend Somer lies dying, attracted, he suspects, by Somer's foul breath; he remembers hearing that a law in Jamaica forbids "the shooting of one of these birds as they are found servic- able in clearing off all carrion" (242). The apparent callousness of treating such a subject just after the death of his dear friend is</page><page sequence="16">492 isle softened by awareness that during his years away from Europe, Penrose has adopted the view of life and death taught by his Indian friends. Their deep understanding that "all things decayed in time except the Sun, Moon, and Stars" finds expression in their practice of immediately remarrying after the death of a spouse (277). Explaining the philosophy behind this, one Indian leader makes a moving oration when Norman Bell, Penrose's Scot friend, refuses to marry a recent widow: Now we hear the voice in the wind saying "Oh, the blackness is coming of the Bird which devours the dead." Must we not all go to sleep? Are you not picking off the flesh from the bones? Our Sister here must return without a covering of love because her love is gone to sleep. Could she keep him awake any longer? Or tell us, did she put him to sleep? You will say, "No no!" Awaken his Spirit again, as it is in your power, that she may find joy and laughing hours, Least the Winds carry the sound of Black sorrow among our People and they should forget the way to this place (244-45). Accepting the naturalness of death, the Indians focus on the on-goingness of life and love. It is not without significance, surely, that the arrival of Penrose's future wife and her brother on Penrose's shore (with all its promises of life's continuity) is occasioned by the impending death of their grandfather. Offering further evidence of his prescient ecological view of life, Penrose begins to suspect, too, that death comes not just to individ- uals but to species as well. During a trip farther into the back country than they had ever been before, Penrose and his companions discover "a monstrous scull of some Beast or other," complete with jaw teeth, then "a Rib of monstrous size," and "more Bones pertaining to the same kind of Beast" (199). The naturalist's plaint echoes in Penrose's comment: "Now what species of Animal it could be I knew not" (199). He is unconvinced by Somer's insistence that it must be an ele- phant, and Harry's report that his "old folks say they had found such when hunting" offers little help (199). The council meeting held on their return home provides no more illumination. Penrose feels sure they have discovered bones of animals that once roamed the land, but exist no more. However, how such enormous beasts, occupying such vast expanses of habitat, had been destroyed confounds</page><page sequence="17">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 493 Penrose, who finds it hard to conceive the possibility that humans could have accomplished such destruction: But how the whole race became exterpated remain'd to us a riddle unless the natives time out of mind had unanimously joyned to destroy them. Yet one should naturally imagine the task was of such a copious under- taking that they could never have succeeded; or as the continent being so extensive, all the natives would never have joyned by mutual consent as being separ- ated thousands of miles asunder and quite unintelligent to each other. But I leave it to the learned to put what constructions on this great mistery they may think proper (232-33).15 In addition to underscoring Penrose's notion of the dynamism of nature (species have disappeared since the Flood), this passage also confronts the possibility that humans can affect the natural world on an enormous scale. This insight into human responsibility for the environment is displayed early in the novel in the account of a fire that Penrose sets. Finding bushwhacking too exhausting, he decides to "penetate into the Woods" by burning a path. The "dreadful," weeklong fire creates a "desert of ashes," scarred by tree trunks and fallen branches. To his dismay, he finds that the fire has destroyed previously undiscovered plantain trees, which could have provided him with a substitute for bread. The irony of this loss echoes in his account of the aftermath of the fire: "there was no getting at them [the plantains] but by their destruction, a means flatly against my interest, and answered only this end[:] to inform me that they did grow in the neighbourhood" (73-74). Yet, Penrose learns, too, that unintended benefits to humans may stem from such changes in the natural world. After the fire, he notices large numbers of ground doves emerging from the woods to "bask in the ashes," so he starts smaller fires in bare places and set snares among the ashes (76). Later he uses the "burnt ruin" as a field for growing yams- "sufficient for our use ever after" (88). The source of plantain bread has been lost; the beauty of the land has been marred; but his food supply has, in the long run, been enriched. Perhaps, it is no accident that shortly after his account of the yam planting, Penrose describes how the strangler fig tree sustains its own life by destroying "its kind benefactor," the host cedar tree (90). Later pressures on the environment affect the quality of Penrose's life in other ways. The nibbling of the goats acquired from traders threatens "what linen we [were] possessed of," so Penrose and his</page><page sequence="18">494 isle crew have to build a shed to house the livestock (304). Gunpowder requires yet another storage room distant from the houses. A fenced-in stream has to be contrived for the growing flocks of ducks and geese. A search for honey results in a fire so devastating "that the place for two miles back and wide was become quite naked and bare" (306). Penrose is "not much grieved" by this because the open spaces denies homes to threatening animals; on the other hand, "the beauty of the place was all gone " (306). He experiences a similar chain of ecological events when he rids his grounds of hawks to protect the chickens, only to discover that taking the avian predator out of the environment leads to the appearance of a new kind of snake that swallows his chickens whole (306-7). Penrose comes to see that the web of natural connectedness reflected in such passages also operates in the human world. That is evident, of course, in his acceptance of the Indian practice of remar- riage upon the death of a spouse. We see it too in the fact that the young Englishman who had assumed that Caribbean natives must be savage cannibals finds not only love, but physical sustenance and support from that very source. The generosity of his Indians friends becomes the model for Penrose's own response to all the shipwrecked folk who come his way, whatever their religion, nationality, race, or disposition. He sees all as linked by humanity and by need. Devotion and duty forge yet stronger links connecting Penrose to his successive wives and children. Virtually every European he encounters urges him to return home, abandoning his "Dung coloured" family; they are as surprised by his genuine love for that family as they are by refusal to leave them (361). That decision, however, can be seen as part and parcel of Penrose's sense of being an inextricable part of a living system. He knows that disruption of the smallest element can irremediably change the whole. What he has learned about nature, he applies to the human world. This recognition of a connection between one's attitude toward nature and one's ethical perspective is but one of many ways in which this early work of American literature of nature presages treat- ments of the natural world in literary works to come. Williams's awareness of this link places him among those writers with insight into the ecological "pattern which connects,"16 a perception that, in the words of Thomas J. Lyon, "include[s] of necessity a transcen- dence, to some degree, of the isolated consciousness of self" - "the moving spirit of American nature writing almost from the beginning" (xv). Locating this sensibility in William Williams's Mr. Penrose : The Journal of Penrose, Seaman pushes that beginning back further than we</page><page sequence="19">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 495 had previously imagined. And, even that far back in our history- in a neglected eighteenth-century novel, by an almost forgotten writer- we find a story of the capacity of the natural world of the Americas to stimulate moral and spiritual growth in the attentive observer. It is the same process Wendell Berry would describe two hundred years later when he wrote: [. . .] I began to think of myself as living within rather than upon the life of the place. I began to think of my life as one among many, and one kind among many kinds. I began to see how little of the beauty and the richness of the world is of human origin, and how superficial and crude and destructive- even self- destructive- is man's conception of himself as the owner of the land and the master of nature and the center of the universe.17 It rests with teachers of American literature and of environmental studies to ensure that neither the message nor the early work which voices it is forgotten.18 Notes 1.

The one salient exception is William Wood's New England Prospect (1634), filled with detailed descriptions of the flora and fauna he observed in Massachusetts from 1629 to 1633. Little known today, the work was read and appreciated by Thoreau (Lyon, 25-26, 95-106). 3. While the Puritan poet Anne BradstreeÅ¥s "Contemplations"- a thirty- three verse paean on the splendors of nature as evidence of God's even greater glory- focuses on nature's smiling side, it, too, fails to speak of the specifics of the natural world. Instead, Bradstreet describes seventeenth- century New England in terms equally appropriate to the Lincolnshire estate she left behind in England. There's a "stately oak" and a "merry grasshop- per," a "black-clad cricket," the "cooling shadow of a stately elm," "a goodly river's side," some "shady woods." Classical allusions ("Thetis' house," "Neptune's glassy hall," "sweet-tongued Philomel") remove these scenes even further from the specific reality of nature in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. 4.

Mr. Penrose includes more than one hundred specific descriptions of some element of nature (that is, a noun reference with some identifying and particular, non-generic, detail). Among those are scores of passages as detailed as the ones cited in this paragraph. These include descriptions such as the fol- lowing: a tree of coral, a codling tree, large beans used to treat bowel com- plaints, various kinds of tortoises, a red-stemmed vine whose stems grow in a star pattern, scorpions, lizards, spiders (including one variety Penrose's friend Bell calls "Red poops"), many strange types of fish (from flying fish to morays), armadillos, snakes (including one with two heads), many kinds of birds (among them, pigeons, partridges, parrots, wrens, and a turkey infested with worms), a brown wasp, a black beetle, sea and land crabs, and ants so voracious they ate "an upright of my table in one nights time" (169). 9. He assumes, for example, that the father of Williams, like Penrose's father, was a mariner (11), that Williams spent several years marooned among natives in the Caribbean (20), and that he probably had a child by a native woman (20). 10. Of course, this generalization requires allowing for some significant differences concerning the finer points about the nature of revelation and the relationship between the physical and spiritual worlds. 11. One of the books Penrose acquires he identifies as "Popes Essay" (214). That he knows Pope's admonition that humans should "presume not God to scan," since "the proper study of mankind is man" is suggested in his approving comment that his friend Norman Bell had come to "know himself" (240)- an allusion, probably, to the first part of the familiar couplet: "Know then thyself"; at another point Penrose quotes Pope's declaration that "what ever is, is right" (219). 12. The term is Thomas Lyon's, who writes: "One of the strengths of American nature writing is its depiction of a growing psychic at-homeness" (xvi). 13. Penrose explains his interest by saying, "whatever came within reach of my speculation never escaped my inquisitive inclination, having from a Child ever taking much delight in prying into the works and wonders of Nature" (267). 14. Finch and Elder write: "Charles Lyell, Darwin, and Alfred Russel Wallace gave a dizzying spin to the static hierarchies of Linnaeus. The dyna- mism and vastly magnified time frame of the new biology and geology left behind the earlier system, with its tidy, fixed categories. A new era of world- wide biological exploration had also begun, inspired by the South American voyages of Alexander von Humboldt from 1799 to 1804. European scientists were especially staggered by the enormous array of species in the tropics, and the Linnaean system began to look increasingly like an antique stamp album, charming but inadequate" (21-22).</page><page sequence="21">Uses of Nature in William Williams's Colonial Novel 497 15.
