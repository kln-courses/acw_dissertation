<plain_text><page sequence="1">Southern Sesotho Literature MOF o W. B Rt:LA NE he origin of Southern Sesotho literature dates from time immemorial. Perhaps it could be said that the literature in question, both in its original, oral form and in the present written form in various genres of imaginative literature, manifests a continuity and vigor rarely, if ever, encountered in the mushroom phenomenon currently in vogue and styled African literature. The same is true of the literatures in Zulu and Xhosa, the two Nguni languages of the Southern Bantu family. For purposes of clarity and fullness of reflection, the present study is confined to poetry. The richness of the oral poetic tradition in Southern Sesotho is evident in all the genres and sub-divisions of oral literature in the language, where certain specific techniques have been evolved. The origin goes far into pre-history, where we are given glimpses of modes of life, culture, and world outlook, together with some bits of information regarding the original home of the Basotho people and their tribulations during the period of migration. The technique of the poetry may be observed in the following invocation, a popular drama enacted when the earth and the live- stock were parched with thirst. For a pastoral people it signifies the importance of rain for the rolling wheel of the seasons: Leader: "Great Ancestor, do hear we pray;/Now ancestors, pray to the ancient one,/Pray to Tlatlamacholo Rammoloki/Rammoloki whose hands have holes,/Whose hands have drops of rain,/Whose hands have blood, the blood of rains,/Your hands are tired of creating us."/Chorus: "Do not pray to us:/Pray to the Great Ancestor, Rammoloki,/Whose hands have holes!" The central thought-that of beseeching, supplication-runs through the whole ceremonial song by means of linking, that is, a device whereby the prominent features occur regularly, repetitively, in the upswing that forms the rhythm. The idea of God and prayer, however, has nothing Christian in it, in that whatever the popular religion of the Basotho then, their supreme deity was an anthropomorphic being; and the prayer here means petition and supplication. The song gives us some inkling of the popular drama of the day, with the part of the leader acted by the chief and that of the chorus by the people. The popular creative mind of the time reached the highest point in the epic poetry of the battlefield, where the warriors were recapturing their feats in the armed encounter, or where they were exhorted to route the enemy. With the Disarmament War of about 1880-waged by the Basotho people against the colon- ial government that sought to deprive them of their weapons, which they were wielding against the Boer and the Briton-we have some gems of the epic tradition in which the fate of the population and con- sciousness of the historical moment found their unprecedented poetic expression: "When regiments exchange fire!/The soldier on a grey steed lay down:/ Why are you snoring, European child,/In such a pouring rain?/Someone has been devoured by Letsie's Vulture,/Has been devoured by Rasenate's Raven,/ Vulture of Sekhobe and Makhabane's family,/Son of heavenly lightning, Meame Ramahotetsa./He-goats collided,/He collided with the ram of Sprigg!/With a whiff of a bullet I shot a European down./He fell in front of the steed,/He fell in front of my steed, in front of Kolbooi./His kin in vain picked him up;/They took up a stone-dead body,/Wrapped it and threw it into the wagon,/Pretending that he would return to life!.../ A white brave left his home swearing,/Beaming with confidence and beating his chest,/Going to the extent of taking off his hat,/He stamped on it with his boots,/ He trampled on it with his feet:/'Submit your guns, you Kaffirs!'/And we refused to submit ours." These verses are from a praise poem by Chief GALERIE CONCORDE LTD.

Sir Bartle Frere, the Governor of the Cape at whose insistence the war was waged, is derogatorily styled Mabekebeke in the original, where Major Sprigg is styled Sapiriti. Chief Maama killed Erasmus, the Boer brave that was caus- ing havoc among the lines of the Basotho warriors. He is the one referred to in the cryptic style of the praise poem above. The latter portion quoted locks the thought in a manner bordering on bathos. There were diverse means whereby the enemy was caustically portrayed, among these satire, irony and caricature. Imagine a European child, amid the armed conflict, literally lying down and snoring in the pouring rain! At times there is a playful poetisation of the incident that seems to blunt the horror of war and the mounting hostilities. This playful cheerfulness seems to point to the trait of character in the representative heroic figure of the period: "Lion's son, be lioness, Seshophe:/ He has broken the bones of bullocks,/Abandoning them littering the veld!/Butterfly of shields, Seshophe,/ He has sneaked into Moeketsi's pocket/And playfully gnawed his private parts!" Some of the stirring lines of the heroic age have re-echoed in the fierce political pamphleteering of the 1950's, urging the political forces on in their struggle for national liberation. For instance, Chief Lerotholi's immortal: "Hold your shield tightly, Rasenate's son,/For you see your motherland in danger of defeat." Chieftanship, then, played a very positive role as a rallying point during the wars of national formation and the disintegration of tribal relations at the portals of the edifice of feudalism. What has been quoted are but snatches from long pieces of historical, linguistic, and artistic importance in which verbal virtuosity, through constant contrast, portrayed the two opposing forces. The fullest flavor of these pieces is best con- veyed in the original language in which they were collected and published by the late Z. D. Mangoaela in 1921 at Morija, Lesotho. The vocal nature of the language together with the derivative tendency of its morphology, the dynamic stress and the mode of delivery of these pieces together with the pitch-the language not being entirely tonal-of the performer in the changing shades of the unfolding poetic landscape -all these contribute to the forceful, captivating qual- ity of the pieces. The choice of words is apt, the thought uppermost, the rhythm neither fake nor con- trived; the harmonious arrangement of the composite parts within the musical pliability of the language renders the mind receptive. The year 1931 saw the publication of the first volume of imaginative poetry in the language by D. C. T. Bereng, of the House of Moshoeshoe, entitled Litho- thokiso tsa Moshoehsoe le tse Ling (Poems on Moshoe- shoe and Others), at Morija, Lesotho. This is a slight but very fascinating poetic effort that was, in due course, to exert influence and touch off many a poetic spark. (It is significant that in 1935 B. W. Vilakazi, along almost identical lines, put out his first volume of imaginative poetry in Zulu.) This poetry, while mani- festing unmistakable ties with the oral poetic tradition, broke new ground technically and otherwise by taking within its folds new modes of expression encountered in conventional literary terms the world over. D. C. T. Bereng, however, rather than toying with European models, was engaged in casting the poetic word in the mother tongue on a broader basis that sought to part with the canons of traditional poetry. Hence, for in- stance, a bold attempt at the stanza form, internal rhythm, and rhyme scheme, with the latter eschewing the incongruous rhyme patterns of the European models. Further, the lyrical depth alternates with the epic sweep of the heroic poetry in the language: "Letters are engraved on Moshoeshoe's grave:/ Here lies Moshoeshoe Moshoeshoaila,/Who has welded tribes into a people./Here rests Matlama's Thesele./ May he find the comfort of his glory,/Chief, in the soil of his land!/Here lies the one who introduced light into darkness,/Power and walking stick of the Basotho people,/Founder and builder of Lesotho./Moshoeshoe has been buried here,/In this formless heap of stones:/ His Royal Highness of Lesotho,/Blood of Peete and Libenyane,/Of Mokoteli's chieftainship..." Note how thought is uppermost: the chief lying buried "in this formless heap of stones", despite his historic achieve- ments. Here is a subtle interlocking of allusion and contrast, almost bordering on bathos, if not controlled irony. The generic tree and poetic appellation are characteristic of heroic poetry in the language. The poet revels in hyperbole and personification in im- mediate proximity without violence to the totality and continuous flow of thought: "When people were burying Chief/With "mokorotlo", the war song of men,/The mountains groaned and moaned;/The heavens were torn asunder;/Winds howled with the 64 GALLERY PRIMITIVE ARTS 2083 WESTWOOD BLVD.

The creation of the atmosphere together with the depiction of the histori- cal moment through the conception of the contempor- ary mind, immersed as it was in its mythological interpretation of the natural phenomena, could not be more captivating. The implications of this sensibility become comprehensible if we recall the burial of the leader in both Whitman and Mayakovsky! Indeed, the poet moves on yet another level that cannot be deciphered in a few words. Here the lyrical spirit, burdened with the far-reaching historical tragedy, assumes the singular channel of the poetic imagery, combining the earth and the moon, through the psychological searchings of the lyrical persona, as the material, palpable elements of its vigorous being: "Tears of death are tormenting me,/My soul is dis- solving away,/My blood vessels are tearing away./My soul is deserting and flying away/As though aban- doning me in space,/As though searching the universe/ For a place of rest./Yesterday happiness was overflow- ing my heart/But today the spear of death is tearing me asunder/For I beheld the moon round as a wheel,/And methought it would never break to pieces!" The nature of metaphor in folk poetry apart, the essence of the foregoing extract could best be grasped against the background of the associations, in the popular mind of the day, between the various phases of the moon and the life cycle. In the original, the pieces teem with emotionally charged words, which express the sud- denness, violence, and thoroughness of the action; for instance, the breaking of the full moon which is formed from the disyllabic ideophone plus an open terminal syllable that gives authenticity to the poet's grief. The subsequent poetic output in Southern Sesotho shows some definite departures from the poetry of the transitional period as studied above. At the same time, there is a conscious and consistent adherence to the traditional roots which are incompatible with parochi- al tendencies and individualism. It is now a poetry with recognisable echoes from European bards, that is, unlike the foregoing gems. Amongst others, K. E. Ntsane, B. M. Khaketla, and Az. Makara are figures that deserve definite attention. Their creative period in the mother tongue directly coincides with the modern fever of the post-World War II period, which is being acclaimed as the era of African literature, (what some specialists term neo-African literature without least suspecting that there has been robust African literature in the mother tongue). Two of the poets, K. E. Ntsane and B. M. Khaketla, are university educated, whilst Az. Makara is, by European definition, almost illiterate. It is to the glory of these men that they are continuing to enshrine their poetic effusions in the mother tongue; whereas it is fashionable in Africa, for various reasons, to explore the poetic vision in the European languages. In 1947, K. E. Ntsane published his collection of poems in Southern Sesotho, entitled Musa-Pelo (The Heart Soother) at Morija, Lesotho; B. M. Khaketla, Lipshamathe (Poems) in 1954, in Johannesburg; Az. Makara also published Lipshamathe (Poems), year of publication not indicated, at Mazenod, Lesotho. Judging from the contents, it is indisputable that Az. Makara's collection appeared in the 1950's. Although both B. M. Khaketla and Az. Makara produced several poems during the late 1930's, they remained un- published until the 1950's. K. E. Ntsane's poetic talent is in the form of satire. There is something Alexandrine in the couplet, which fails to come off owing to the structure of the Southern Sesotho language. K. E. Ntsane's social satire has its roots in the popular Southern Sesotho satire, which can be seen in a work such as Bo-Khooana-Ts'oana (Black Europeans): "If you fear, fear the Black Euro- peans,/Fear them together with their wives, the ladies,/The ones with shining nylon stockings:/Cracks on the legs are dongas dug by thunderstorms,/Cracks on the feet are like furrows dug by a tractor plough- share./Do fear, fear the Black Europeans!" K. E. Ntsane's attitude, in the satirical manipulation of the mother tongue, is manifest in this free employment of borrowings from European languages, chiefly English and Afrikaans, in depicting elements of material cul- ture to which the Black Europeans, in aping the masters, so fondly cling. In thus debasing the language, he shows the emptiness, the bankruptcy of the cretins. 65</page><page sequence="4">B. M. Khaketla's poetry has some features of intel- lectualism, which have been drawn from readings in English literature. For example, the poem Sa 'Mokot- sane (A Dirge) hinges on Tennyson's In Memoriam; and Tholoana tsa Boikakaso (Fruits of Inordinate Pride) on Milton's Paradise Lost, with some literal translations in both cases. Khaketla, while standing on traditional soil, seeks to fertilize his poetic output with the achievements of English literature to the extent that he ignores the basic features of Southern Sesotho poetics as dependent on the structure of the language. His grasp of the language, his range of vocabulary, is very wide indeed. For him, King George VI is a popu- lar hero of the heroic age, and so is Queen Victoria who, however, is caricatured in one nineteenth century Xhosa poem as an hyena with hanging breasts! He makes a revealing exposition of the Southern Sesotho poetics in the first thirty-eight pages of his Lipshamathe. In practice, what he gives us are poetic parallelograms lacking in flexibility and resourceful- ness. The thematic thread is wide and firm and the social content quite meaningful if not pertinent. Here is a poet whose intellect, immersed in European tradition divorced from its cultural climate, drove him to make a copy of the genres in a tongue that could not bend to the laws of the language of his mentors. Khak- etla is fundamentally involved in a constant struggle between a traditional poet, and a mediocre poet striv- ing to transplant elements from somewhere else. He failed to achieve a harmonious blend. The roots of the unfortunate conflict are in the lop-sided educational background that floundered when it came to the social and historical aspects of the phenomenon under study. He has broadened the horizon and touched on almost every aspect of the life of his community. He has not abandoned the social orientation of literature, which has been manifest in the preceding literature in Southern Sesotho. Some of his lines are difficult to render into English. He is a political satirist who could shout: "Here the foreign breed is forcing/the bread of oppression down our throats!" Khaketla is an eminent linguist, novelist, and playwright. He is an educator and a statesman, whose political pamphle- teering and activities in the 1950's contributed sub- stantially to the struggle for colonial disengagement in his country. Indeed, like Thomas Mofolo, he deserves a full-length study. K. E. Ntsane is a novelist, play- wright, and short story writer-a sorrowful artist, forced to be a rolling stone in the land of his birth. Az. Makara is somewhere midway between the two poets, while at the same time, occupying a special place in the history of Southern Sesotho literature. He is strictly a traditional poet who has managed to put his outpourings on paper. His poetry is infused with the vigorous spirit of the heroic age, whether he cele- brates the ordination of the late Bishop E. G. 'Maba- thoana, or the devotion of a pagan converted to the Catholic faith, or the regency of the late Paramount Chieftainess 'Mants'ebo Seeiso, or the meandering River Zambesi. When he deplores the tragic conse- quences of the migrant labor system-especially after the undemocratic Hertzog labor legislation of 1936- there is a moan of the dirge and the suppressed politi- cal outcry in the refrain: "I, Mother of Children, moan in shattering pain!/The embryo of the millet grain has been gnawed away by an insect!" When he considers the riches of Africa being depleted for the sole benefit of the foreign powers, he makes Africa address herself to Europe thus: "Your offspring have bled me white./ They have wrenched away gold and diamonds/And fled into the sea;/The offspring of the partridge have remained empty-handed:/The Africans shall remain wailing among the ruins!" His poetry derives mainly from the traditional beliefs, the circumcision song, and the epic poetry. Hence, the Mystery of Incarna- tion signifies, for him, the mysterious nature of the Supreme Being of traditional, popular belief in South- ern Sesotho lore. He associates the Sesotho legend of the Swallowing Monster with Christ and the cruci- fixion. Indeed, the power of Az. Makara's poetry is not in extolling religious fanaticism, nor is it in the stringing together of liturgical terms. Rather, it is in the exuber- ance of the imagery, in the poetic reordering of reality that finds concentration and inexhaustible charm once the chaff has been discarded. With the new problems besetting the country at the moment, there is a feverish effort on the part of the creative minds to flood the printing presses. We have confined ourselves to those moments and creations which we consider to be milestones in the culture of a people. The true greatness of the men discussed here, according to Spender, lies in the fact that they have blazed the path with the indomitable nature of their spirit, which is itself an irrefutable reflection of the national spirit that gives them sustenance.
