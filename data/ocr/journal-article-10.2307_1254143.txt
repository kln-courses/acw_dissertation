<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EUROPEAN SKY-GOD. BY ARTHUR BERNARD COOK. IN a series of six articles contributed to The Classzical Review, 1903-1904, under the title of "Zeus, Jupiter, and the Oak," I attempted to determine the original character of the chief Graeco-Italic deity and the nature of his cult. The materials that I accumulated for this purpose, when pieced together, formed a reconstruction so unorthodox in its outlines that I should have hesitated to publish it, had I not found that in several important points it agreed well with the main argument of Dr. Frazer's Golden Bough. Encouraged by this support I pushed on; and further study has convinced me that my conclusions with regard to Zeus and Jupiter hold good for the corresponding gods of the Celtic, the Germanic, and the Letto-Slavonic peoples, if not for those of all branches of the Indo-European stock. I must, however, at the outset frankly confess that beyond the limits of the classical field I have no claim to speak as an expert. Scholars who have specialised in any of the mythologies of northern Europe will, I doubt not, find much to criticise in my remarks. Indeed, it is precisely in order to " draw the fire" of such criticism and thus to test the validity of my hypothesis that I have ventured to put pen to paper. I propose, first to restate (with some modifica- tions) my general conclusions with respect to the ancient Greeks and Italians, and then to deal with apparently similar phenomena among the Celts, Germans, Slavs, &amp;c., in each case considering how far cults evidenced by the literature or the monuments or both afford a real analogy to the results obtained in the Graeco-Italic area.</page><page sequence="2">The European Sky-god. 265 THE GREEKS. The supreme deity of the Greeks was essentially a sky- god.1 As such he was called the " Bright" One, his name Zev' being referable to a root that means " to shine " and implies the " daylight."2 Thus-to give but one example -the Iliad links together "the clear air and the rays of Zeus," where, as the scholiast ad loc. observes, by " the rays of Zeus" the poet means the sky.3 Empedocles4 speaks of elemental fire as Ze" Jpyj~*, i.e., "Zeus the brilliant"; and it is probable that Argus, a hero who figures largely in Greek mythology,5 was at bottom none other than the "Brilliant" sky-god.6 This primary conception of Zeus as a sky-god developed in two secondary directions. On the one hand, the sky is I See e.g. Preller-Robert, Griechische Mythologie, p. 115 ff., Gruppe, Grie- chische Mythologie u. Religionsgeschichte, p. I Ioo ff. 2 O0.

Two misleading explanations may here be noted. (i) E. H. Meyer, Germanische Mythologie, pp. 182, 220, holds that zses denotes properly the "hurler" or "discharger'" of rays (cQ. H. Grassmann, Worterbuchkzum Rzg- veda, p. 6oo, s.v. div) and infers that he must have been the lightning-god, not as is commonly supposed the god of bright daylight. But the frequent use of the word dyaus in the Rig-veda for " sky" or " day " (A. A. Macdonell, Vedic Mythology, p. 21) and the existence of the Latin dies beside Diespiter are conclusive in favour of the common view. (2) Against Dr. Frazer's sugges- tion (The Golden Bough,2 iii. 456 f.) that Zeus was named " Bright " as being the oak-god, i.e. god of the tree whose wood was used in fire-making, I have elsewhere protested (Class.

As the rustic Corydon puts it in an idyll of Theocritus : Xo ZI AXXoica itv 7r'ict a7OptoC, '\Xoca a' ijEt. Ay, Zeus is sometimes fine and sometimes wet. Hence the Greeks at a very early date extended the notion of Zeus as a bright sky-god to cover that of Zeus as a weather god.8 The man in the street said: "Zeus rains," " Zeus snows," " Zeus sends the hail." 9 The minstrel in the palace-hall was ready with high-sounding epithets :" He of the dark clouds " (KeXaLveo~c), " He that rumbleth aloud" (dpjyovrjrov), " He that hurleth the thunderbolt" (reprlc'pavvo9). In various localities Zeus was worshipped under special weather-titles, e.g. Zeus "the Thunderer" (BpovTrov), Zeus " of the Fair Wind" (E c/~veor), " Zeus of the Rain " ('T~to9).0o Marcus Aurelius 11 has preserved the Athenian equivalent of our prayer "In the time of Dearth and Famine ": it runs as follows:- VUOV, VboV7, &amp; L0Xs ZEi, iard r cic povpac rTic 'A0vaiwv real rTv rresiwv Rain, rain, dear Zeus, On Athens' tilth and Athens' plains.

Now in polished classical times the thunderbolt was commonly regarded as a weapon flung by Zeus.-4 But in by-gone animistic days Zeus had been identified with his own bolt.'6 Similarly in the historical period rain was "water from Zeus," or " the shower of Zeus."'6 But there were not wanting expressions that hinted at a closer connection. Matron, the parodist of Homer, dubbed rain "the child of Zeus"; 17 Orphic writers spoke of it as "the tears of Zeus"; 18 Aristophanes more suo as the water of Zeus.'9 Indeed, it is probable that Zeus had originally been thought to come down himself in the form of rain. This belief may underlie the usage of 4vtov or y~vtov i8p, i.e., "Zeus- water," as a term for rain-water in magical formulke.20 It would account for the extraordinary significance attached 13 Brit.

Thus it was as a fall of golden rain that Zeus visited Danae.2 And two similar epiphanies are recorded by Pindar, whose knowledge of the details of folk-lore was only equalled by his appreciation of their beauty. Thebes, he tells us, " received the lord of the gods in a midnight snow of gold," what time he came down to woo Alcmena.24 At the birth of Athena, too, " the mighty king of the gods once rained snow-flakes of gold upon the town" of Rhodes.25 Pindar does not expressly assert that Zeus was in the wondrous shower: but, that he was, is almost certain; for another Rhodian tale made Zeus consort with the nymph Himalia 8t' i~ppov, " by means of rain." 26 The conception of Zeus-in-the-rainwater is important, because it led on to further developments. The rain formed rillets, and the rillets ran into brooks, and the brooks swelled into streams, so that Homer can call even large rivers " Zeus- fallen" (8tt7reTeF)27 and " Zeus-nurtured" ( 7torpe9ee).28 The same connection of ideas can be traced in some of the principal Zeus-cults of Greece.

" Aeschylus, son of Euphorion," says Pausanias,32 " applies the name of Zeus also to the god who dwells in the sea." So did another Greek poet cited in the Etymologicum Magnum.33 Oppian34 calls dolphins " the servants of Zeus who thunders in the brine " (iXvty8ovioto). An Orphic hymn 35 speaks of "Zeus of the deep brine" (7rwvTroW elvC?Xtog). Proclus 36 too mentions a Zeus vdaXtogo; and Hesychius 37 states that Zeus was worshipped at Sidon under the title aXdaioto9. Other evidence bearing on the point could be got together; 38 but enough has been said to show that the Greeks passed by easy transitions from the recognition of Zeus as a sky- god to the recognition of Zeus as a water-god. On the other hand, a " bright " sky-god must have stood in some relation to the sun. That luminary appears under various transparent disguises in Greek mythology. Some- times it is a rayed disk or swastika or triskeles; sometimes, 29 Paus., 8. 38. 4. 30so The word is in all probability connected with Nata (a spring in Laconia: Paus., 3. 25. 4), Nafaic, vaiw, viLa, &amp;c.

But it will be observed that there is a tendency to connect most of these images with Zeus. The rayed disk of Lycia, the swastika of Crete, the trz'skeles of Sicily, have all been regarded as his sacred symbols."9 Ixion was bound to a fiery wheel by Zeus: nay more, Ixion was a by-form of Zeus himself,40 who at Chios was known as Ivpa,,o, , " He of the round wheel."41 When Prometheus dared to plunge his ferule into the solar wheel,42 .e., to work the celestial fire-drill, it was Zeus whom he offended, for Zeus at Thurii was himself Ilpo/tavpcetv, " He of the fire-drill "4 : according to the oldest version of the legend extant, Prometheus stole the fire directly from Zeus.44 The ship Argo was built by Argus, who has been already identified with the Argive Zeus,4' and had inserted in her framework a portion of the oracular Dodonaman oak46-obviously in order that Zeus might be aboard his own vessel to direct her course.

In the story of Atreus' golden lamb Zeus causes the sun to travel backwards,49 and, since con- trol of the sun's course constituted an equal claim to king- ship with possession of the golden lamb, it is not improbable that the golden lamb was the sun itself.50 Again, the golden ram, which carried Phrixus and Helle through the air till the latter fell into the Hellespont, affords so close a parallel to the myth of Phaethon that we are forced to interpret it as a piece of solar symbolism.5' Phrixus, who got safe to Colchis, sacrificed this ram to Zeus Jt)v`tog and gave its fleece to Aeetes, son of Helios, who hung it on an oak-tree in the grove of Ares: so much we are told by the Greek mythographer Apollodorus,52 but a valuable Latin treatise on mythology preserved in a Vatican manu- script adds that the golden fleece stripped from Phrixus' ram was that " in which Zeus climbs the sky" "--a clear case of Zeus being equated with the sun. Similarly Zeus "Atazw v was at once sun-god and ram-god ;4 and Herodotus accounts for the yearly clothing of his statue at Thebes with a fresh ram's skin by the quaint tale that Zeus put on the head and skin of a ram before he would show himself t9 II., 2. io6, schol.

Strabo 499 asserts that the whole legend arose from the practice of the Soanes, a Colchian tribe, who were said to catch in fleeces the gold that was brought down by mountain torrents. This explanation, though plausible (see Ridgeway, Origin of Currency and Weight Standards, p. 70), is-like almost all rationalising explanations-wrong. The golden ram cannot be thus separated from the golden lamb. Besides, the analogy of the myth of Phaethon and the parentage of Aeetes, child of the Sun, confirm the solar connection. - Apollod., I. 9. 16. 53 Myth. Vat. ed.

The skin of the victim sacrificed to Zeus MELXiXLOC or to Zeus Krintog was known as At6e CdWtov, " the fleece of Zeus " (Polemon ap. Hesych. s.v.), or A!ov i$0tov, " the Zeus-fleece " (Polemon ap.

Harrison (Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion, p. 23 ff.), on the strength of the verbs &amp;toroTrZv, aroroo7ropt7rav, denies any connexion with Zeus, and refers us to the root appearing in the Latin dirus. But why should not these verbs mean practically what Eustathius says they mean-" to send away evil things in the name of Zeus 'AXE'icaoC " (Eustath., 1935, 13) ? Hesychius too connected them with Zeus (Hesych., JLo0royra-eOat" KaOalp'av.

Rams'-skins were elsewhere used in the service of Zeus. In the heat of summer, when the dog-star appeared, a procession of young men clad in fresh rams'-skins made its way to the sanctuary of Zeus 'Arpa'io on the summit of Mt. Pelion (Dicaearch., 2. 8).

But an inscription from Thoricus, a town on the south-eastern coast of Attica, speaks of a Zeus Avav',Tqp, Zeus "the Scorcher." 73 And there are some grounds for supposing that Zeus AvKcatoO was a solar deity: Lycosura, high up on the side of Mount Lycaeus was "the first city that ever the sun beheld "; and in the precinct of Zeus no shadows were cast by man or beast.75 However that may be, it is undeniable that there was a tendency among the Greeks, especially among the Greeks of the Archipelago and Asia Minor, to connect Zeus the "bright" sky-god with that most striking mani- festation of his brightness-the sun. Rapp,76 following the lead of Sonne and Roscher, argues that Zeus the daylight- god was naturally also a sun-god to begin with; but that, as the conception of Zeus developed, his solar character- istics split off from the rest of his attributes and were attached to a fresh sun-god, Apollo: that this process was repeated, Apollo becoming more and more spiritual until his physical function as a sun-god was taken over by yet another personification, Helios, who in turn was endued with traits that are at least anthropomorphic and ethical. Without insisting upon every stage of this evolution we may well grant that Zeus had, so to speak, a solar side to his character. Now the nightly passing of the sun through the western " Gates of Helios " 77 seems to have led to the belief that the solar Zeus had his dwelling beneath the earth. Zeus "App~ov, for example, was identified not merely with the sun but with "the setting sun of Libya ";78 and 72 Class. Rev., xviii., 80. 73 See Jessen, in Pauly-Wissowa, ii., 2264, s. v.

Simi- larly at Dodona Zeus had an intermittent spring, which at midday, when the sun was high over head, ceased to flow altogether, while at midnight, when the sun was deep underground, it was at its fullest: 8o so potent were its solar virtues that unlighted torches when brought near to it burst into flame.sl Moreover, the Ammonium and Dodona were the two most famous oracles of Zeus. It would seem that the solar god having seen all things by day with his unwinking eye 82 retires by night to his nether home, whence by the agency of his interpreters he sends up knowledge to those that would know. This explains why the great oracular gods of the Greeks were Zeus and Apollo: 83 both of them were solar.

Hesiod8s bids the Bceotian farmer pray to Zeus XB0vLot, Zeus " of the ground," along with Demeter. Zeus indeed was Xo6vtol, a subterranean god, not only in poetry 90 but in actual cult, being worshipped under that title at Olympia,0" at Corinth,'2 and in Myconus.93 Aeschylus 94 makes Danaus assert that in the world below " another Zeus, so men say, judgeth sins with a last judg- ment among the dead," while the chorus of Danaids declare: " If we cannot gain the ear of the Olympian gods, we will die by the noose and come with suppliant boughs to Him of the earth (rov ydtov), the right hospitable Zeus of the dead." An Orphic poem 95 speaks of the snake which guarded the golden fleece as " a portent of the earthy Zeus" (XapaLt?Xoto). And an epigram of Metro- dorus 96 mentions "a sacrifice to Zeus of the ground" (oV'aTo4). In art too Zeus was sometimes represented as lord of the upper- and under-world alike. Thus a marble statuette in the British Museum shows him seated with the eagle on one side of his throne and Cerberus on the other.97 In short, there is abundant evidence to prove that Zeus the sky-god had come, by whatever route,9" to be conceived as an earth-god also. 1 Hes.

I am far from denying the possible influence of this latter conception. Sky-god may have become earth-god not only vid sun-god but also vid rain-god, farmer's- god, &amp;c. But it is, I think, on the whole probable that Zeus as an earth-god preceded Zeus as a farmer's-god, rather than vice versd.</page><page sequence="14">The European Sky-god. 277 We have seen that Zeus the sky-god was also a water- god and an earth-god; that, in fact, the Orphic theologians were not far wrong, when they addressed the Sun as- ayXEa ZEV AtLvvTE, TrdrTp I vTOZ ,7f6p alEp . " Shining Zeus-Dionysus, Father of the Sea, Father of the Earth." 99 This differentiation and development of the attributes of Zeus explains, if I am not mistaken, the Homeric myth of the Cronidae. According to the Iliad,100 Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, the three sons of Cronus and Rhea, divided the world between them. When they cast lots, " Zeus received as his portion the broad sky in the upper air and in the clouds," Poseidon got " the hoary sea as a perpetual habitation," and Hades had " the thick darkness of the west." That it is really Zeus who in three aspects of his own being thus rules the three main divisions of the world, appears in the first place from various passages of ancient literature in which Poseidon is definitely identified with Zeus as a water-god and Hades with Zeus as an earth-god. Proclus1io says of the three sons of Cronus: "The first . . . is called by one name, Zeus; the second, by two names, Zeus of the Sea and Poseidon; the third, by three names, Zeus of the under-world and Pluto and Hades." The Elymologicum Magnum102 similarly extends the meaning of the word Zeus: " It denotes four things: (a)' God' or 'the sky,' as in II. 13. I '1When Zeus had brought the Trojans,' &amp;c. (b) 'Poseidon,' as in Od. 5. 304(?) 'Zeus stirred up the, sea,' &amp;c. (c) 'The under- 99 Orph. hymn.frag. 235 Abel. 100 II. i5. 187 ff. 101 Procl. in Plat.

If it be objected that these and other similar identifications 104 are all literary and may be merely metaphorical,"'5 it is possible to point to a few definite cults of Zeus-Poseidon and Zeus-Hades. A god who bore the compound title Zeno-Poseidonl'0 was wor- shipped in Caria. His temple stood beside a river in a place where thunderbolts were supposed to fall with especial frequency;107 and he appears on coins of Mylasa holding an eagle in his left hand and resting on a trident with his right.108 As to Zeus-Hades, Dr. Farnell 109 justly observes: " The chthonian Zeus undoubtedly appeared in the group of Zeus-Hades in the temple of Athene Itonia at lo3 Eustath., 763, 52, io rb ZE0 c Vlrot Z iv roLvbv ovotLa sAteb cal IIHOOEL&amp;Jt cat "Ataov dy ri EX1Mjw. 104 Schol.

Further, if Poseidon and Hades were but variant forms of Zeus, fresh light is thrown on several ancient myths, such as that 11 which made Heracles single-handed vanquish the trio Phcebus,113 Poseidon, and Hades at Olympia; or that 114 which made Zeus, Poseidon, and Apollo simultaneous suitors for the hand of Thetis; or that'11 which made Zeus, Poseidon, and Hermes (or Apollo) co-parents of Orion. Again, the art- types of Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades are extraordinarily similar. The substantial points of resemblance and the slight points of difference between Zeus and Poseidon have been minutely studied by Overbeck.116 But in the end we have to admit Zeus-like Poseidons and Poseidon- like Zeuses, or figures which might appropriately bear the name of either god. So with Hades: Dr. Farnell"l7 notes " the close resembance which the type of Zeus bears to that of Hades through all the periods of Greek art."

Art represented the three sons of Cronus as externally very similar, but distinguished them by a rendering of their characteristics and attributes." Finally, I would venture to maintain 11' that the name of Zeus is an integral part of the names of both Poseidon and Hades. For, if the known varieties of these three names be arranged side by side, it will appear that they have a common element Da- or Dau-, which are forms of the name of Zeus: Zeus. AEtg Aav (ace.)

Mr. Marindin, for example, writes :122 " Poseidon seems to have been worshipped originally by the oldest branches of the Ionic race in especial. It is possible that when they were an inland people mainly, he was the god of running streams and wells, and that as they occupied more and more sea-coast towns his worship took particularly the form, which eventually everywhere prevailed, appropriate to the god of the sea. In Thessaly, a well-watered country, without many sea-ports, his character was that of a god of rivers." There is much evidence of Poseidon as a god of rivers, springs, and wells :123 but, though his appearance in a dream, according to Artemidorus,124 portends rain, and though a scholiast on Homer125 expressly connects him with the rainfall and remarks that the month of the winter rains was called IIocret~E'v, it is probable that the fresh-water aspect of Poseidon was terrestrial rather than celestial. That is to say, Poseidon as a chthonian god'"2 manifested himself in the deep-sunk wells, in the springs that bub- bled up from the ground, in the streams that gushed out of the rock.127 But in either case, whether the river was regarded as fallen from Zeus the sky-god or risen from Zeus the earth-god, Poseidon would be with equal pro- priety named " Zeus-in-the-drinking-water."

" the earth." Hades would thus be " Zeus-of-the-earth,"128 a conception for which we have already found ample justi- fication. In early times the Greeks, like other semi-civilized peoples, ascribed to their gods a plurality of heads, arms, legs, &amp;c., with a view to expressing superhuman powers. For instance, Typhon had a hundred heads,129 Briareus a hundred arms,1s0 Scylla a dozen feet.131 Naturally the numbers differed in different myths, or even in different forms of the same myth. Without attempting to be exhaustive in the matter, we may here mark two main tendencies. (a) In the first place, the total was commonly reduced, sooner or later, to three. This reduction may, no doubt, have been due in part to artistic conveni- ence:132 to depict a hundred arms or even a dozen feet in a realistic or convincing way was difficult, if not impossible. But it was also due in part to a yet more elementary diffi- culty, viz., the primitive inability to count beyond two, which, as Professor Tylor133 long since showed, has left traces of itself both in the popular conception of the numeral three as a kind of superlative and in the gram- matical recognition of singular, dual, and plural. These ' H. L. Ahrens (Philologus, xxiii., 2II) hints at this derivation: in sup- port of IloarEuoWv = the Water-Zeus he says-" Diese deutung wird noch eine sehr kr~iftige bestiitigung erhalten, wenn es mir gelingen sollte den namen des dritten Zeus 'AitrSj in ganz analoger weise zu deuten."

We have, therefore, some warrant for supposing that for the unsophisticated Greek three was tantamount to "a number," a typical plurality. Hence Typhon the hundred- headed was also represented as a three-bodied monster both in literature137 and in art.138 Scylla, according to one account, has not six heads but three.139 Pindar140 and Horace,141 using a poet's license, might give Cerberus a hundred heads-Hesiod14" gave him fifty-but he was ordinarily thought to have three.143 The number of heads 134 On the use of three as a superlative in Greek see H.

The Lacedae- monians had a cultus-statue of Apollo with four ears and four hands'47; and small bronze figures with several arms holding a bow, &amp;c., have actually been found on Greek soil.148 On a fine stamnos in the Berlin collection the wind- god Boreas has a Janiform head.149 Coins of Tenedos show a bearded and a beardless profile of Dionysus joined together in the same way'50: coins of Thasos, a double-faced Satyr.'51 Hermes, whose statue by Telesarchides in the Ceramicus had four heads,152 was represented in the Attic deme Ankyle 144 b., i., 2769. 145 Ib., i., 1630 ff. 1" Ib., iii., I218. 147 Zenob., I. 54, quotes the following explanation of the proverb a'cove roi ra r2icapa Wra ~xovroc : " Others say that the proverb bids men hearken to them that speak truly.

Perhaps we should be nearer the mark if we held that Greeks and Italians alike inherited the same primitive conception from an immemorial past.156 It remains to apply these results to the particular case of Zeus. Was he too ever credited with a multitude of members? Were they at any time represented by a total of three? Was he anywhere Janiform in appearance? Now it may be at once admitted that the worship of Zeus the bright sky-god had from the first an upward and elevating tendency, which made for henotheism, not to say monotheism. I cannot refrain from quoting Professor Lewis Campbell's157 beautiful rendering of two passages in which Aeschylus sets forth his own conception of Zeus. The first is spoken by the chorus of Danaids:158 Let highest in mind be most in might. The choice of Zeus what charm may bind ?

Zeus was now contrasted, rather than com- pared, with the old polymorphic powers of nature. He figures as the foe of the Titans, not as a Titan himself, though their name, as M. Mayer 163 has shown, may well be a mere reduplication of his own. He chains the fifty- headed and hundred-handed Briareus in a subterranean prison.'6" He blasts with his thunderbolt the hundred- headed Typhon.1'G Nevertheless there are not wanting indications that Zeus himself had been at one time on much the same footing as these his monstrous rivals. Argus, the Argive Zeus, surnamed Ilavn7rTrl~, "the All- seeing," had eyes all over his body.166 They might be reckoned at a hundred,'67 or for that matter at ten thousand."6 Pherecydes, 169 however, obeying what we may call the law of triadity, declared that Argus had but three eyes, one of which was in the back of his head. Others, following the second of the rules enunciated above, represented Argus as having a Janiform head. This is 162 E.g., in the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. For the former see Plat., Phileb., 30 D, Tim., 29 D-30 B, alib. For the latter, Aristot. met., 12. 7. 1072 b. 2, 15 ff., 1074 b. 33 ff., alib. 163 M. Mayer, Die Giganten u.

Cratinus 171 the comedian wrote a play called the llav6rrat, in which the members of the chorus had "two heads apiece and countless eyes." The vase-painters also sometimes conceived of Argus as possessing a double set of eyes. An early Chalcidian amphora now at Munich172 gives him a pair of eyes in the ordinary position and an extra pair on his breast. A black-figured Attic amphora, now at Naples,173 shows him with a Janiform head com- posed of a bearded and an unbearded face, united under a petasos, or flat felt hat: his body, wherever visible, is marked with a series of eyes. It appears, then, that the Argive Zeus was sufficiently barbaric to conform to the multiple, the triple, and the dual types of divinity. Probably, however, it was the triple type that appealed most strongly to the popular mind and received the sanction of actual worship. For, on the one hand, threefold sight recurs as a family peculiarity among the descendants of Argus: his grandson was called Triopas, "the Three-eyed." 174 And, on the other hand, the cult of a three-eyed Zeus flourished at Argos for well over a millennium. Pausanias,175 writing in the second century of our era, tells us that he saw on the Argive Larisa "a wooden image of Zeus with two eyes in the usual place, and a third eye on the forehead. They say that this Zeus was the paternal (7iazpw^ov) god of Priam, son of Laomedon, and stood in the courtyard under the open sky; and when Ilium 170 Hes.

In the division of the spoil Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, got this image, and that is why it stands here." The cult thus attested for Argos and Troy probably ex- tended to other Pelasgian towns. It is significant that the name Triopas occurs again as that of a religious founder at the Carian Triopium.176 A Rhodian hero, the son of Helios and Rhodos, bore the same name.177 Triopas or Triops was also the father of Merops the Coan.178 Rhodes and Cos had alike in early days been peopled by Carians,179 and the Carians were but one tribe of the Pelasgian stock; 180 so that the four personages named Triopas thus far men- tioned were all probably Pelasgians. Again, a certain Triopas was king of the Pelasgians at Dotium in Thessaly, where dwelt the clan of the Triopidce.11s Another king of the Perrhambians, who occupied a part of Thessaly known as Pelasgiotis,182 was called Triopas.183 Lastly, the father of Pelasgus himself bore the same name.184 It can hardly be doubted that the name Triopas or Triops, wherever it occurs, has reference to the cult of the three-eyed Pelasgian Zeus. The same deity figures in a Peloponnesian legend. When the Heraclide returned to the Peloponnese, an oracle bade them take as their guide "the Three-eyed One " (rTv TrptO0aXl/ov). They followed a man driving a mule, which was blind of one eye,185 apparently not real- ising the drift of the oracle.

Zeus, and cast lots for Argos, Lacedaemon, and Messene.'86 In all probability the Paternal Zeus of the Heraclidae, like the Paternal Zeus of Priam, was the three-eyed Pelasgian god.187 The Greeks, forgetful of their own past, were somewhat puzzled by this type of a triple deity. The explanation usually given was that such and such a god or goddess ruled in three different departments of nature. Thus the triple Hecate, a strange form introduced into art by Alcamenes a contemporary of Pheidias,l88 was regarded by Orphic writers as the mistress of sky, sea, and earth.'89 Tzetzes1'9 states that Hermes was three-headed " as being a sky-god, a sea-god, and a land-god." Porphyryl'9 sug- 186 Apollod., 2. 8. 4. 1sT H. Usener in his "Dreiheit " (RKiein. Museum, 1903, N. F., Iviii., 161 ff.) argues that a divine triad, conceived as having three bodies, may degenerate into a single body with three heads or faces or eyes. Thus Hecate, who was usually represented as three complete figures back to back, is often rptLcdprqvoC, a three-headed herm, sometimes Tp,7rpopdaw7rog with a three-faced head, and once at least rplyXnvog with a three-eyed face (ib., pp. 163-166, 184). He therefore takes the name Triopas to imply " eine Verkiirzung urspriinglicher Dreileibigkeit " (ib., p. 183 ff.). This argument, though I accepted it in Class. Rev., xviii., 75, now appears to me inconclusive. Three eyes may be, and probably are, an original equivalent or a later abbreviation for many eyes. Further than this we cannot go with safety.

The same explanation served for the three-eyed Zeus. Indeed, in his case it was peculiarly appropriate, since, as we saw at the outset, the primary conception of Zeus as a sky-god had actually given rise to the two secondary conceptions of Zeus as a water-god and Zeus as an earth-god. Hence Pausanias was no fool when, after describing the old image of Zeus on the Argive Larisa, he continued 192 : "The reason why it has three eyes may be conjectured to be the following. All men agree that Zeus reigns in heaven, and there is a verse of Homer which gives the name of Zeus also to the god who is said to bear rule under the earth:- Both underground Zeus and august Proserpine. Further, Aeschylus, son of Euphorion, applies the name of Zeus also to the god who dwells in the sea. So the artist, whoever he was, represented Zeus with three eyes, because it is one and the same Zeus who reigns in all the three realms of nature, as they are called." At Corinth the same thought seems to have found a less grotesque expres- sion. " Of the images of Zeus," says Pausanias,193 "which are also under the open sky, one has no surname: another is called Subterranean; and the third they name Highest." It is commonly supposed, though the supposition is not quite inevitable, that here too we have a sea-Zeus, an earth-Zeus, and a sky-Zeus.194 Zeus had a sacred tree, the oak.195 If we ask why the oak in particular should have been sacred to him, the later 192 Paus., 2. 24. 4, Frazer. 193 Paus., 2. 2. 8, Frazer. 194 For other possible examples of the Zeus-triad see Class.

Greek writers reply that Zeus was the life-giving god, and that the oak, thanks to its acorns, was the life-supporting tree of primitive man.196 But it is obvious that this ex- planation depends for its validity on an etymology that we now know to be mistaken, viz. the supposed connection between the words Zet;` and nv, " to live;" More probable is the view 197 that the oak represented to the Greeks the Yggdrasill-tree of Germanic mythology. This world- tree ( Weltbaum), as it used to be called, or cloud-tree (Wolkenbaum), as it is termed nowadays, was an enormous ash, which with its three stems 198 spread throughout the vvorld towards heaven and earth and hell.'99 It is described as an ash (askr), that being the highest leaf-tree of the north.?00 But further south the oak was the principal tree. Consequently the name askr was transferred from the ash to the oak: Hesychius mentions atcicpa as a kind of oak,201 and Zeus 'AaicpaFos was certainly an oak-god.202 It is, 1' Cramer anecd. Gr.

Throughout Finland, Esthonia, and other parts of Russia folk-songs and folk-tales tell of an oak the top of which reaches the sky and supports the sun, who lives on it or goes to rest on it.Y03 Thus the Finns believe in an oak with golden branches, which cover the sky. The Estho- nians, in an oak on which is built a bath-house: the window of this bath-house is the moon, and on its roof the sun and stars disport themselves. Other Russian stories tell how an old man once climbed an oak that towered up to the sky, and found on it a bird, which could not be burnt with fire or drowned in water: how in the island of Bujan grows an oak on which the sun passes the night: &amp;c., &amp;c. In Anjou certain tree-shaped cloud-formations are known as "le chene de Montsabran" and "le chine marin": they portend a rain- storm and fine weather respectively.204 That in the Greek area also the oak was at one time a world-tree is far from improbable. The fleece of the golden ram (=the sun 205) hung on an oak in Colchis and guarded by a sleepless snake206 certainly recalls the Russian oak on which the sun goes to rest guarded by the dragon Garafena.207 But more direct evidence is available. Clement of Alexandria208 has pre- served a fragment of a work by Isidorus, son of Basilides, in which he says: " I would have our would-be philosophers learn the meaning of the winged oak-tree and the em- broidered mantle upon it, in fact of the whole allegory which Pherecydes took from the prophecy of Cham and 203 A. de Gubernatis, Myth. des Plantes, i., 94, ii., 76 f., Ralston, Songs of the Russian People, p. 375 f. 204 P.

Clement and Isidorus are alike intent upon showing that the Greeks borrowed all their wisdom from the Hebrews, so that we may probably discount "the prophecy of Cham." It is at least as likely that Pherecydes of Syros, who was a prominent Orphic teacher at Athens about the middle of the sixth century B.C., worked into his philosophic speculations a bit of genuine Greek folk-lore. In another passage0"9 Clement quotes a sentence from Pherecydes himself : " Zas made a great and beautiful mantlee and embroidered thereon the earth and Ogenos and the abode of Ogenos." Ogenos was Oceanus,210 so that the embroidered mantle represented both land and sea. Further light on the matter could hardly have been looked for. But, by a singular stroke of good fortune, a papyrus-scrap of the third century A.D., acquired by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt211 for the Bodleian Library, was found to contain a couple of columns from the HleTrre~vXos?, the lost work of Pherecydes; which columns give us the context of the very sentence quoted by Clement. It now becomes clear that Pherecydes was describing the marriage of Zeus and Hera.212 Zas or Zeus, among other preparations for the ceremony, made a richly-dight mantle representing land and sea, and apparently spread the same (by way of bridal couch ?) on the summit of a winged oak.

Corresponding to the celestial oak that formed the residence of Zeus, an ordinary terrestrial oak marked each centre of Zeus-worship among men. In the Classical Review for 1903-1904214 I have collected most of the evi- dence bearing on this point. Here I may be allowed to quote a few typical or outstanding examples, premising that in every case, so far as I can judge, they may be referred to the Pelasgian stratum of Greek religion. The Pelasgian Zeus Ni;oq at Dodona had a sacred oak growing in a sacred oak-grove: his oracles were given by the rustling of its branches, by an intermittent spring at its foot, by a golden dove (or two doves, or three) perched upon it, &amp;c.215 Zeus "Apazov in the Libyan Oasis seems to have been the god of a very early Greek settlement: he too had an oracular oak in an oak-grove, a variable spring, sacred birds (two ravens, or a dove), and methods of divination that resembled those of the Dodonaean Zeus.216 Coins of Phaestus in Crete represent Zeus FEXlavoo as a youthful god seated in an oak and holding a cock on his knee: since Velchanos is commonly supposed to be the same word as Volcanus, and 213 Gomperz, Greek Thinkers, i., 89, conjectures " that the garment spread by Zas over the winged oak was merely a pictorial expression of the belief that the kernel or framework of earth was adorned by this first principle of life with the beauty that it now wears." 214 Class.

But just as the world-tree varied from ash to oak in passing from north to south of Europe, so the tree that marked the residence of Zeus on earth differed in different localities. Substitutes for the oak were the poplar, the olive, the plane, &amp;c., according to local changes of vegeta- tion. It should, however, be remarked that all these trees were called by names elsewhere used to denote the oak; and further, that it is always possible to trace some botanical resemblance between the oak and its surrogate. 217 Class.

This change of meaning probably arose in some district where the poplar, not the oak, was the finest tree.22" It would be facilitated by the fact that some sorts of poplar resemble in foliage some sorts of oak. Thus Pausanias,227 describing a species of oak called 7rat8pwco, says: " Its leaves are less than those of the oak, but larger than those of the evergreen oak: in shape they resemble oak leaves: one side of them is blackish, the other is white: their colour may be best likened to that of the leaves of the white poplar." Nicander 228 speaks of ths same tree as "the equivalent of the white poplar." This similarity between oak and poplar was in all proba- bility the reason why the white poplar was sacred to Zeus at Olympia. When Heracles first sacrificed to him there he burned the victims " on wood of the white poplar" 229 and ever afterwards the Eleans used no other wood for the sacrifices of Zeus.230 Indeed, at Lepreum, an Elean town some fifteen miles from Olympia, Zeus was surnamed AeKcao49, "he of the White Poplar" (Xe;zic).231 Coins of Sardes show Zeus AV`8to holding a sceptre and perhaps an I Schrader Reallex., pp. 164, 207. 226 In the opinion of Dr. W.

This was the case at Athens, where Zeus Mo'pto was guardian of the sacred olive-trees called the p~opiat dXa-at.234 That the Greeks traced a similarity between the oak and the olive is clear from the fact that they sometimes called the Valonia-oak Ja(t, i.e. the "olive "-oak.235 Probably, as in the case of the white poplar, it was the combination of a light surface with a dark which suggested the comparison.236 Similarly a species of wild-olive termed /vXla is described as " resem- bling the evergreen oak." 237 The wild-olive was sacred to Zeus at Olympia, having been brought there by Heracles from the land of the Hyperboreans to supply a dearth of trees: it had this peculiarity, that the upper, not the under, side of its leaves was white.238 In Crete the finest tree is the plane.239 Tradition said that Zeus had consorted with Europa at Gortyn under an evergreen plane. This tree, on account of its remarkable foliage, Theophrastus compared with an oak growing at Sybaris; 240 and coins of Gortyn show a female figure seated in a tree that is sometimes a plane, more often an oak.241 235 Class.

Zeus VKaacdLO was named after the fig-tree.243 Zeus 'EXuctvovt, after Mount Helicon, which perhaps means the mountain of "willow "-woods (icKtW).24 Zeus bearing an eagle is enthroned with a palm-tree before him on a coin of Alex- ander the Great.24 And the use of Ats I38Xavoq, "the acorn of Zeus," as a name for the chestnut 246 implies that the god stood in some special relation to this tree also. As the celestial tree had its counterpart in the terrestrial, so the sky-god himself had a visible representative on earth. The traditional epithets of the Homeric kings, "Zeus-born" (AtoyevP), " Zeus-nurtured" (Atorpefo?), "divine" (AFos), " god-like" (Oeoets8'q, 'eoeieKXoq, a'vTIeoq, l0o0Oeoo), and the stock phrase, "to honour such an one like a god" (Oe'v cxw), were doubtless conventional formulae on the lips of the Pelasgian minstrel; but they were based on 242 Ib., xvii., 277. See also Bbtticher, Baumkultus, p. 117.

That this was so, I infer partly from a consideration of several early Greek myths, partly from the occasional recrudescence of the belief in historical times, and lastly from the direct testimony of ancient authors. Let us take the myths first. The story of Salmoneus is given with most detail by Apollodorus,248 who says: " Salmoneus . . . came to Elis and founded a town there. He was a proud man and fain to place himself on a level with Zeus; for which impiety he was punished. For he declared that he was Zeus, and depriving Zeus of his sacrifices he bade men offer them to himself. He attached to a chariot leather thongs with bronze caldrons and trailing them after him said that he was thundering; he tossed blazing torches towards the sky and said that he was lightening. Zeus therefore struck him with a thunderbolt and destroyed the town founded by him and all its inha- bitants." The mythographer of course, judging from a later standpoint, regards Salmoneus as a paragon of impiety. But, that he was no such exceptional sinner, appears from the case of his own sister Alcyone. "Ceyx, son of Heosphorus, married Alcyone. They perished through their overweening pride. For Ceyx declared that his wife was Hera; Alcyone, that her husband was Zeus. Zeus then changed them into birds, making the one a halcyon, the other a ceyx."249 Apollodorus must needs tax them both with superhuman conceit: but in point of fact they were within their rights. The same primitive custom perhaps underlies the legend260 that Polytechnus and AMdon 247 This belief is rather near the surface in such a passage as II., 24. 258 f., where Priam speaks of his son " Hector, who was a god (OEdO) among men, nor was he like unto the son of a mortal man, but of a god (OEolo).' 248 Apollod., I. 9. 7. 249 Ib., I. 7. 4. 250 Anton.

Again, Agamemnon king of Mycenae was called Zeus in Laconia.251 So was Amphiaraiis son of Oicles at Oropus.22 So was Trophonius son of Erginus at Lebadea,2'3 where Zeus also bore the significant title, Bacret"c, "the King." 254 According to Panodorus, Zeus reigned as a king in Egypt for twenty years; according to Manetho, for eighty.255 The tale that Zeus visited Alcmena in the form of Amphitryon perhaps had a similar found- ation"56; and this may have been the case with several other " Liebesverbindungen " of Zeus.2"7 Conversely, the re- lations of Ixion to Hera,258 of Tantalus to Dione,259 &amp;c., point in the same direction. Even in historical times it was no unheard of thing for a man to be regarded as a god.

Whensoever with them, both men and women, I come to a flourishing town, there am I worshipped. They follow along with me in countless throngs, fain to enquire what is the path to prosperity: some ask for oracles; others in all manner of diseases hear and hearken to my healing voice, albeit long pierced with sore pains." Since the historicity of Lycurgus the Spartan law-giver is still a moot point,261 I will not appeal to the fact that in later days he was wor- shipped as a god (80e)."62 But after the battle of Aegos- potami in 405 B.C. another Spartan, Lysander, was certainly recognised as a god: altars were erected to him, offerings brought, and paeans sung, while the Samians actually changed the name of their immemorial festival, the Heraea, to Lysandrea in his honour.263 At Athens Cratinus more than once spoke of Pericles as Zeus,64" and a well-known passage in the Acharnians of Aristophanes 26. says: " Then Pericles the Olympian in wrath Lightened and thundered and confounded Greece." These phrases of the comedians voiced a belief that had been latent among the Athenians for centuries. The popular champion was the embodiment of Zeus. Hence, when Demetrius Poliorcetes entered Athens in 302 B.C., " the people received him not only with frankincense and garlands and libations of wine, but also with processions 261 G.

Even Menecrates of Syracuse, court-physician to Philip of Macedon, assumed the title Menecrates Zev' on account of his life-giving powers and went about wearing a purple robe and a golden crown to look the part.272 Examples could be multiplied; for among the Hellenistic successors of Alexander cases of deification are common.73 If I am right in my conjecture, they must be considered as due to a recrudescence of the early Pelasgian belief in the essential divinity of the king. Finally, Tzetzes, whose authority in matters of mytho- logy is not small, definitely asserts that the ancient Greeks used to call their kings " Zeuses " (Ales). Thus, for 266 Athen., 253 c.

This statement, which is repeated several times by him in different connections,274 was clearly one of his regular canons of interpretation. Nor does Tzetzes stand alone in the matter. The famous grave of Zeus on Mt. Jukta in Crete, which according to one account 275 bore the inscription- 36e Oavv r~elrata Z&amp;v, 'v Ala rKtCKLrcXTovo~L "Here lies dead Zan, whom men call Zeus,"- according to others276 was the tomb of King Minos. On this and other grounds it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Minos was held to be a human embodiment of Zeus.277 He was in fact one of those " consecrated men whom the Greeks call Zanes"-to quote a much misunderstood phrase from Macrobius.278 Further, if Minos was a man-god of this sort, we can understand the contention of Euhemerus 279 -which took such a hold upon the imagination of the Romans s80--that Zeus had been a former king of Crete. It appears, then, that mythology, history, and literature alike bear witness to the early Greek beliet that the king was a human Zeus.

Certain functions of the human Zeus too may be grouped under the same three headings. As vice- gerent of the bright sky-god he had control of the sun, and was expected to feed its flames. As representing the god of showers and storms, he could cause rain to fall or evoke a sudden thunderstorm. As an earth-god incarnate, he was responsible for the crops in their season, and after death became a ruler in the underworld. Traces of all these powers can be detected here and there among the remnants of Greek legendary lore and ritual practice. Minos, for example, married Pasiphae, a daughter of Helios,281 and received as a present from Hephaestus or Zeus the bronze man Talos,282 whose name means "the sun."283 Solar, too, in character were the Labyrinth, which was represented by a swastika pattern,284 and the Minotaur within it.285 Minos, therefore, was believed to have the sun in his custody. Aeetes also, whose father was Helios, possessed the fleece of the golden ram that symbolised the sun.286 Atreus prided himself upon a golden lamb, again a solar symbol, which he kept shut up in a coffer. Thyestes stole it by guile, and then declared to the people that the man who owned the golden lamb ought to be king. To this Atreus agreed; and it looked as though the kingdom would pass from him to Thyestes. But Zeus sent Hermes and bade Atreus make a compact about the kingdom, in- forming him that he was about to cause the sun to travel backwards. Atreus made the compact, and the sun set in the east. This miracle was accepted as proof of Atreus' 281 Roscher, Lex., iii., 1666, where Tiirk observes that IIaatpan is an epithet of Helios (Orph. hymn., 8. 13 f., aOacvare ZEi, I Ej t, iraapaai, K6o'jov 7b 7rfpicopopov 6 Oqta). 282 Apollod., I. 9. 26; Ap.

On reaching the country he and his two elder brothers took service with the king of Lebaea as herdsmen. The king, alarmed by an omen, dismissed them; and when they demanded their pay offered them, in a fit of infatua- tion, the sunlight that was streaming into the house through the chimney. The two elder brothers stood and gaped: but Perdiccas with a knife traced the contour of the sun on the floor, and having thrice drawn the sunshine into his bosom departed. Ultimately he won the kingdom to which he had thus established his claim.2ss Not only was the sun-king, as these myths show, thought to possess and control the solar orb, but he was also bound to feed its flames. In Crete Talos renewed his heat by leaping into a fire;289 and the oak-Zeus was served else- where by enormous bonfires kindled from time to time on the hill-tops. Appian 90 has preserved an interesting account of a sacrifice to Zeus h-Tpa'Ttog. " Mithradates," he says, " offered sacrifice to Zeus Stratius on a lofty pile of wood on a high hill according to the fashion of his country, which is as follows. First, the kings themselves carry wood to the heap. Then they make a smaller pile encircling the other one, on which they pour milk, honey, wine, oil, and various kinds of incense. A banquet is spread on the ground for those present . . . and then they set fire to the wood. The height of the flame is such that it can be seen at a distance of ,000ooo stades (125 miles) from the sea, and they say that nobody can come near it for several days on account of the heat."

" On the summit of the mountain an altar has been got ready. They make it in this fashion :-They put together quadrangular blocks of wood, fitting them into each other, just in the same way as if they were constructing an edifice of stone. Then, having raised it to a height, they pile brushwood on it. The cities and the magistrates sacrifice each a cow to Hera and a bull to Zeus, and burn the victims, which are filled with wine and incense, together with the images (z'.e., the oak-brides) on the altar. Rich people sacrifice what they please: persons who are not so well off sacrifice the lesser cattle; but all the victims alike are burned. The fire seizes on the altar as well as the victims, and consumes them all together. I know of no blaze that rises so high, and is seen so far." It is highly probable that both these bonfires were intended not merely as a means of sending food, &amp;c., aloft to the sky-god,"' but also as a sun-charm-the great conflagration replenishing the solar powers of the oak- Zeus.293 Coins of Amasia, which illustrate the Pontic rite show a large altar, sometimes of two stages and flaming: beside it are two trees with twisted trunks, and above it in some specimens hovers an eagle or the sun-god in his chariot or both.294 Appian's phrase "the kings themselves carry wood to the heap " tersely expresses the primitive duty of the sun-king.295 But this duty was not confined to an occasional bonfire on a big scale. Fires were normally burning before the tree that marked the residence of the god. Thus Silius Italicus says of the oracular oak in the Libyan Ammonium: 291 Paus., 9. 3. 6 ff., Frazer. 292 Tylor, Primitive Culture, ii., 278, Roscher, Lex. i., 2620. 293 Cp.

Coins of Aphrodisias in Caria repre- sent a sacred tree fenced in and flanked by two lighted altars: 297 coins of Attuda, a tree with a single lighted altar in front of it.298 Coins of Sardes show Zeus A6~Lol on a pedestal beneath a poplar-tree: before him blazes a large altar decorated with figures in relief; and amid the flames can be distinguished the heads of four bulls.299 On coins of Mastaura in Lydia a lighted altar stands garlanded beside a cypress-tree.o00 Coins of Mostene have the same scene with the addition of a male figure on horseback carry- ing a double-axe and wearing a crown of rays: the radiate crown proves the solar character of the rider.301 An altar in front of a tree planted beside a temple of Zeus occurs on coins of Diocaesarea in Cilicia.302 An altar by a tree figures repeatedly on coins of Amasia in Pontus.303 A coin of Prusa in Bithynia represents Caracalla, sceptre in hand, sacrificing at an altar, which burns before a tree : above the tree is an eagle.304 And, lastly, a coin of Elaea in Aeolis shows a male figure in military costume, probably Herennius Etruscus, sacrificing at a lighted altar placed beneath a tree.304a Between such altars and the perpetual fires or lamps of Greek religion no sharp distinction can be drawn.

It is therefore probable that the same simple-minded belief obtained elsewhere, and that the maintenance of the sun's heat was commonly connected with (perhaps thought to depend on) the up-keep of the perpetual fire or lamp. This -and, I venture to hold, nothing short of this-will explain the consternation felt when the flame by some accident was extinguished: there was then a danger that the sun itself might fail. This enables us also to understand why such fires among the Greeks were tended by women past the age of child- bearing : the perpetual fire represented the sun, and the idea that women may be impregnated by the sun is common to Greece and many other lands.308 Lastly, the same hypothesis will account for the method by which the Greeks re-kindled their perpetual fires when there was need to do so. Plutarch 309 says: " In Greece where they have a per- petual fire, at Pytho and Athens for example, it is tended not by virgins, but by women too old to marry. Should it by any chance go out, as the sacred lamp at Athens is said to have done during the tyranny of Aristion and that at Delphi when the temple was burnt by the Medes, whilst during the Mithridatic and Social Wars at Rome the fire disappeared 30 Plut. de def. orac., 2. 306 Plut., ib., 3. 307 Frazer, Golden Bough,2 i., 115 ff. 301 Ib., iii., 220 ff. so309 Plut. vit.

They usually do this by means of concave mirrors, whose shape is determined by the revolution of an isosceles rect- angular triangle, so that all the lines from the circumference meet at a centre. When therefore the mirror is held over against- the sun, it collects all the reflected rays and con- centrates them at this one point: the air here becomes rarefied, and light dry matter on being subjected to it is soon kindled, since the ray acquires the substance and active force of fire." A perpetual fire of the sort here described was, as Dr. Frazer has shown,310 simply a survival of the king's hearth, and as such it was regularly main - tained in the prytaneum or residence of the king. It is therefore permissible to suppose that the Pelasgian king, who kept a fire constantly burning on his hearth, was the earthly counterpart of the sky-god who kept the sun alight; nay more, that the two stood to each other in the well- known relations of mimetic magic, and that the king, as often as he put fuel on his fire, was virtually making sun- shine for the community. If this be so, we can understand why the hearth was so intimately connected with the king on the one hand and with Zeus on the other. Aristotle 311 speaks of "offices which derive their honour from the public hearth: some," he says, "call them archons, others kings, others again prytanes." So essential indeed was the link between the public hearth and the king, that at Priene a temporary king (/pactXAe6) was appointed solely for the purpose of performing the sacrifice at the Panionian festival.312 Zeus, too, was closely connected with the 31o Journ. of Philology, xiv., 145 ff. 311 Aristot., 1ol. 7. 8. 1322 b, 28 f. 31s Strab., 384. Elsewhere he is called a pjytanis: see Class. Rev., xvii., 415-</page><page sequence="48">The European Sky-god. 311 public hearth. At Aegae313 in Aeolis, for example, the oak-Zeus was worshipped side by side with Hestia, the per- sonification of the hearth: in the Odyssey314 an oath is several times taken by Zeus and the hearth of Odysseus: Pindar315 addresses an ode to " Hestia, goddess of the prytanea, sister of Zeus most high and of Hera who shareth his throne." Some of the titles of Zeus are drawn from the same connection. He is the god "who holds the hearth" (&amp;eoG)oosr),316 or "who is seated at the hearth" (4 rirtol),317 or " who shares the hearth with men " (i`E'o-atolo po~rov).318 Secondly, the king represented Zeus as the god of the stormy or rainy sky. As such he could himself cause a thunderstorm or a shower. In a recently recovered ode of Bacchylides 319 Minos proves that he is the son of Zeus by praying: Zeus our Father, mighty in strength, hearken. If in truth the white-armed woman of Phcenicia bare me to thee, send forth now from the sky the swift lightning with its fiery curl, thy token that all men know. Zeus in answer to "the immoderate prayer" at once hurled the lightning and thereby acknowledged his son. The scene, which is in fact a mythological commonplace, was probably based on the belief that the divine king could evoke a thunderstorm at will. In early days this would 313 Class. Rev., xviii., 78.

The legend of Salmoneus, already related,320 is from this point of view highly interesting. It introduces us to the paraphernalia of a primitive king, who claimed that he could thunder aud lighten z'n propria persona. In his bronze caldrons and blazing torches subsequent ages saw only a grotesque imitation of the tempest. The study of comparative religion would teach us rather to recognise in the din and glare a genuine attempt to raise the storm by the ordinary methods :of magic. Almost equally primi- tive are the means by which the representative of Zeus AvKcaio9 made rain for the Arcadians. Pausanias,321 speak- ing of the spring Hagno on Mount Lycaeus, says: " If there is a long drought, and the seeds in the earth and the trees are withering, the priest of Lycaean Zeus looks to the water and prays; and having prayed and offered the sacrifices enjoined by custom, he lets down an oak-branch 322 to the surface of the spring, but not deep into it; and the water being stirred there rises a mist-like vapour, and in a little the vapour becomes a cloud, and gathering other clouds to itself it causes rain to fall on the land of Arcadia." Here the rain-charm is used in conjunction with prayer; but otherwise the ritual might take rank with that of Salmoneus.323 Finally, as an embodiment of the earth-god the king was responsible for the fruits of the earth. Lycurgus, king of the Thracian Edoni, is described by Euripides324 as 3*o Supra, p. 300. 32' Paus., 8. 38. 4, Frazer. 322 On Zeus Avcatog as connected with the oak see Class.

His tale is variously told, the most instructive version being perhaps that of Apollodorus,325 who says: " Wheul the land remained barren, the god delivered an oracle that it would be fruitful, if Lycurgus were put to death. Here- upon the Edoni took him to Mount Pangmaus and bound him. There he perished according to the will of Dionysus, destroyed by horses." Dr. Frazer."26 rightly interprets this as an example of a king punished by death because he had failed to supply his people with the crops in their season. Somewhat similar is the opening scene of Sophocles' master- piece, the Oedipus Tyrannus. A blight had fallen upon the land of Thebes, withering the buds, and making the live-stock barren. The common folk repair to the king's palace with the branches and wreaths of suppliants. They are headed by the priest of Zeus, who implores Oedipus to help them. Sophocles is indeed careful to make the priest say: " It is not as deeming thee equal to the gods that I and these children are seated at thy hearth." 327 But that is a concession to later piety. More primitive is the word- ing of his appeal: " Find for us some succour, whether thou canst hear it from the voice of some god, or haply knowest it as a man."3" Plutarch's329 account of the Delphic ceremony called Charila, is worth quoting in this connexion: " A famine once fell upon the Delphians in consequence of a drought; so they crowded to the doors of their king as suppliants along with their wives and children. He, since he had not enough for all, distributed barley and vegetables to those of them who were known to him. But, when a young orphan girl came and besought him, 32 Apollod., 3. 5.

She, being poor and helpless but not ignoble in character, went away and hanged herself with her own girdle. Hereupon the famine increased and was followed up by diverse diseases, till the Pythian priestess bade the king propitiate Charila, a virgin who had put herself to death. Having with some difficulty discovered that this was the name of the girl whom he had beaten, he paid her an expiatory sacrifice, which is kept up at intervals of eight years to the present day. The king sits on his throne distributing gifts of barley and vegetables to all, strangers and citizens alike. A childish figure of Charila is brought in; and, when all have taken it in their hands, the king beats it with his sandal. The chief of the Thyiades next raises it and bears it to a rocky glen. Here they fasten a cord round the neck of the figure and bury it on the spot where Charila, who hanged herself, was buried." Without discussing the details of this curious rite, I would point out that it clearly involves the king's obligation to supply his people with food-an obligation probably based on the belief that the king was the embodiment of the god: Apollo at Delphi was _traXKca, " He who protects the crops."'330 It was but natural that a man-god possessed of such chthonian power should, when life was ended, be regarded as a king over the dead. A magnificent Tarentine vase, found at Canosa and preserved in the Munich collection, shows among other denizens of the underworld Triptolemus of Eleusis enthroned between Aeacus and Rhadamanthys: from his head rise ears of wheat, an obvious symbol of his function as grain-giver to men.331 More often we hear of Minos as judge of the dead.332 But of these four royal 330 Paus., IO. 15. 2.
