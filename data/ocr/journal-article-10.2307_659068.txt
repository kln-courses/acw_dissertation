<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERIODICAL LITERATURE CONDUCTED BY DR ALEXANDER F. CHAMBERLAIN [NOTE.-Authors, especially those whose articles appear in journals and other serials not entirely devoted to anthropology, will greatly aid this department of the American Anthropologist by sending direct to Dr A. F. Chamberlain, Clark University, Worcester, Massachusetts, U. S. A., reprints or copies of such studies as they may desire to have noticed in these pages. - EDITOR.] GENERAL Anthony (R.) Contribution 'a l'6tude de la morphogenie du crftne. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, ve s., IV, 579- 58o.) Unlike man, the carnivora (dog) with strongly developed masticatory ap- paratus show a crotaphyte muscle which is an obstacle to brain evolution. Azoulay (L.) Musees et collections phonographiques en France. (Ibid., 536.) Brief note recording the fact that the fine-arts section of the Celtic Congress possesses more than 900 original melodies on phonographic cylinders. L'6preuve linguistique comme moyen d'identification des individus soumis aux recherches scientifiques. (Ibid., 565- 568. ) Author argues for a "linguistic test," or scientific shibboleth, to guard against mistakes in the record of linguistic data given by individuals,- e. g. a man claiming to be from Accra was proved to be a Fanti. Barnhill (J. U.) The development of ob- stetric surgery. (Columb. Med. J., Co- lumbus, 0., 1903, repr. 1-16.) Treats of obstetrics among ancient Egyptians, Jews, Greeks, Hindus, Romans; and modern European peoples during the last three centuries. Instruments, operations, etc., are historically considered. Bartels (P.) Ueber Vergleichbarkeit kraniometrischer Reihen. (Z. f. Eth- nol., Leipzig, 1903, xxxv, 935-951.) Technical discussion of the possibility of measuring and numerically expressing the "anthropological utility" of cranio- metric series, based chiefly on Ranke's and Koganei's material. The "index of utility" is the percentage of the middle number to the range of variation. Bucke (W. F.) Cyno-psychoses. (Pedag. Sem., Worcester, I903, X, 459-513.) Treats of children's thoughts, reactions, and feelings toward pet-dogs, data from questionnaires. Contains also ethno- graphic material from various sources. Bibliography of 113 titles. Author thinks dog was first "an economic assist- ant~in life's struggles." Chamberlain (A. F.) Primitive woman as poet. (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 1903, xvI, 205-221.) Treats of poetic activities of woman among primitive peo- ples of all parts of the globe, also among the various nations of Europe in their primitive aspects. The American Indians and the Negroes receive special attention. Legal folk-lore of children. (Ibid., 280). Resumes first part of A. de Cock's Rechtshandlingen bi] de Kinderen, in Volkskunde, 1902-1903, xv, 193-199- Colella (R.) Linguaggio e cervello. (Ann. d. Clin. d Mal. ment. e nerv., Palermo, 1903, 1900-1902 [1903], II, 127-168.) General discussion of facts concerning the evolution of language and the human brain. The primal psychological fact is sensation, then association. The cere- bral cortex is by no means uniform in function. Language offers us clear proofs of man's becoming and perfection. Czekanowski (J.) Zur H6henmessung des Schidels. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1904, N. F. I, 254-258.) Technical discussion, with tables of measurement, of various ".heights " - 21 heights from basion, opisthion, ear-heights, etc., ac- cording to numerous authorities. The author measured 50 Disentis skulls to determine the relative value of these heights, and concludes that the best 343</page><page sequence="2">344 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, I904 suited for the study of craniological type are the bregma-basion and the vertical ear-height. Dwight (T.) A separate subcapitatum in both hands. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1904, xxIv, 253-255, I fig.) Brief account of subcapitatum, corresponding to "Pfitz- ner' s prophetic description." I Fehlinger (H.) Zunahme der Krebser- krankungen. (Naturw. Wohnschr., Jena, 1903, XVIII, 546-547.) Discusses cancer-statistics of U. S. Twelfth Census and those of Hamburg as considered by Dr Fuld at pages 404-405. An increase of cancer-mortality seems to mean a de- crease in tuberculosis-mortality. In the U. S. urban mortality is not greater than rural, vice versa in Hamburg. After the 45th year, the white race suffers more than the others, before it less. Die Sterblichkeit der europiischen und der Neger-Rasse. (Ibid., 1904, xIx, 280-281.) Discusses U. S. Census statistics ; author attributes greater negro mortality to the smaller vitality of the race. Fischer (E.) Zur vergleichenden Osteo- logie der menschlichen Vorderarm- knochen. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, XXXIV, 165- 170o, 2 figs., tables.) Comparative study of the bones of the forearm in Euro- peans, primitive races, anthropoids. The curve of the radius, Dr Fischer shows is, as Klaatsch declared, "an ancient pri- mate-inheritance," - the Neanderthal radius falls within the human range of variation. The Neanderthal ulna, how- ever, preserves the olecranon-cup, which has almost entirely disappeared in the present races of man. Gorke (0.) Beitrag zur funktionellen Gestaltung des Sch.dels bei den Anthro- pomorphen und Menschen durch Unter- suchung mit Rantgenstrahlen. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1903, N. F. I, 9i- io8, 2 pl., 2 figs.) Gives results of in- vestigations with X-rays of anthropoid and human skulls in the Selenka collec- tion in Miinchen as to relation of face and cranium, functional changes in skull, effect of teeth on surrounding bony struc- ture, effect of lower jaw pressure, etc. Author concludes that both internally and externally the skull is influenced by function (especially mastication), result- ing in difference between man and the anthropoids. de la Grasserie (R.) De la sexualit6 chez les divinit6s. (R. de 1'Hist. d. Relig., Paris, 1903, XLVIII, 48-67.) In themat- ter of sexuality of deities evolution is from non-sexuality (in a certain sense in man also) to anthropomorphism, preceded and prepared for by animism, and sexuality. Under the influence of anthropomorphic imitation various religions have made much of sexuality --the gods imitate man even in his genesic excesses. Chris- tianity has converted the primitive triad into a trinity; instead of continuing to imitate the body, it has imitated the mind. In the case of the Virgin, ma- ternity was preserved with the elimina- tion of sexuality. Ultimately asexuality was reached. Hahn (E.) Entstehung des Getreidebaues. (Z. f. Ethnol., Leipzig, 1903, xxxv, 1903, 1oo7-1019.) Author traces origin of agriculture to ancient Babylon-- " agriculture and irrigation have always gone hand in hand." Hahn does not refer to McGee's writings on this topic. Headlam (A. C.) Early Christianity and archeology. (Rec. of Past, Wash., 1903, II, 372-376.) Discusses the debt of New Testament interpretation to arche- ology. Hill-Tout (C.) Totemism, a considera- tion of its origin and import. (Trans. R. Soc. Can., Ottawa, 1903-1904, II. s., IX, 61-99.) After giving a brief state- ment of "what is regarded by leading American students [Powell, Fletcher, Cushing, Boas, et al.] as the doctrine of totemism," the author discusses recent views of Tylor, Lang, Frazer, Haddon, et aL, and sets forth his own opinion that " the personal totem undoubtedly does give rise to the family and group totem." He opposes Lang's " nick-name theory." Differences between "totems " and "fetishes" lie mainly in the way in which they are severally acquired. Holl (Prof.) Der Schiidel Hamerlings. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1902-1903, XXVII, 259-275, 4 figs., tables.) De- tailed description of the skull of the poet Hamerling, with references to those of Schiller, Kant, Bach. An extraordi- nary development of the bregmatic region is noted. Krause (E.) Die Verwendung von koh- lensaurem Ammoniak und Chloram- monium bei der Konservierung von Eisenaltertiimern. (Z. f. Ethnol., Ber-</page><page sequence="3">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 345 lin, 1903, XXXV, 791-793.) Author believes he has at last discovered an electrolytic bath highly preservative of iron objects against chemical injury. Laufer (R.) L'addition du sel aux ali- ments est-elle n6cessaire ? (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1904, ve, s, I, 455-460, 489-493.) Contains some data on use of salt by various peoples. Author con- cludes that use of salt with foods is not absolutely necessary, as they contain largely what is needed in themselves. Lickley (J. D.) On the relations of the seventh and eighth ribs to the sternum in man. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1904, XXIV, 326-332.) Based on examination of 51 adult sterna in the dissecting room of University College, Dundee. The eighth rib in man is a degenerated sternal rib, and the seventh is becoming such. Loria (G.) Encore les femmes math6ma- ticiennes. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1904, ve S., I, 338-340.) Reply to Mlle. Joteyko. See American Anthropologist, 1903, N. S., V, 164. Macnamara (N. C.) Kraniologischer Be- weis f'ir die Stellung des Menschen in der Natur. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1902-1903, XXVII, 349-360, 4 figs.) Dis- cusses changes in skull conformation and capacity, from the anthropoid apes, past the Pithecanthropus of Java, the Nean- derthal man, to the Galley Hill and Til- bury types and the living races. Prog- ress results from inborn growth capacity, race-mixture, and long-continued influ- ence of environment. The skull, not the skeleton, has developed in recent man. Mason (0. T.) The past is in the present. (Rec. of Past, Wash., 1903, 11, 332- 335). Treats of the ethnologist, the historian, the archeologist, the pale- ographer, the philologist, the sociologist, the folklorist, the craftsman, and the religionist as guides in the study of the " awful conservatism of mankind, "-the part of human activity is seen in the present in four forms: decaying, vestigial, surviving, and vitalizing. Michel (R.) Eine neue Methode zur Untersuchung langer Knochen und ihre Anwendung auf das Femur. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1903, N. F., I, 109- 122, 6 pl., 7 figs.) Describes a new method of determining and explaining mechanically the form of the long-bones (the femur in detail) by means of the observation and measuring of a series of cross-cuts. Femurs of man (adults, chil- dren), the race of Neanderthal and Spy, orang, gorilla, hylobates, indri, etc., are treated of and measurements given. Sec- tions of the femora of Neanderthal and Spy show figures like those of modern man. Those of children in the lower parts resemble those of the gorilla and orang. Newell (W. W. ) Sources of Shakespeare's "Tempest." (J. Amer. Folk-Lore, Bos- ton, 1903, XV, 234-257.) A valuable comparative and critical study of the "Tempest" in relation to such possible folk-lore sources of the "bird-wife" type. The contemporary German drama, Die Schkne Sidea, by Jacob Ayrer, is also considered. Mr Newell concludes that "with the English poet, the mrirchen, received through literary mediation and pared to the vanishing point, served merely as a peg on which to hang golden fruit." - In Memoriam - Henry Carrington Bolton. (Ibid., 275.) Brief record of life and scientific activities, with list of chief works. Petsch (R.) Volksdichtung und volk- stiimliches Denken. (Hess. Bl. f. Volksk., Leipzig, 1903, II, 192-211.) Discusses the nature and relationship of folk-song and folk-thought. Imagina- tion, content, form, combination, anal- ogy, "monarchism," pessimism, love, extreme tendencies, emotion, feeling, sensualism, etc., are considered. For the author: "Folk-song is only that poetry which the philosophy of the com- mon man is able to express in his own language and by such means as exert a special influence upon him." The ques- tion of folk-song is one with that of folk- thought. Pinto (C.) O antigo imperialismo portu- guis e as leis modernas de governo col- onial. (Bol. d. Soc. d. Geogr. de Lisboa, 1903, xx, 209-297.) General discussion of the Portuguese imperial policy. Author seeks to show that the imperialistic ideas of d'Albuquerque are the political type after which have been molded the modern principles of good colonial administration. Popowsky (J.) Contribution . la mor- phologie de l'artere saphine chez l'homme. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, ve, s, IV, 596-607, 6 figs.)

Phylo- genetic data are discussed. Preuss (K. T.) Religionen der Natur- v6lker, 1902-1903. (Arch. f. Religw., Leipzig, 1904, VII, 232-263.) Useful critical r6sumes of books and articles printed in 1902-1903 on the religions of primitive peoples, - General, North America,. Mexico and Central America, South America. Works of Hewitt, Mat- thews, Schurtz, Culin, Bogoras, Boas, Dorsey, Dixon, Fletcher, Mooney, Fewkes, Le6n, Kroeber, Lumholtz, Seler, Maler, Gann, Bdissler, etc., are noticed. Ranke (J.) Ueber Hirnmessung und Hirnhorizontale. (Corr.-Bl. d. deut- schen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1903, xxxIv, 161-163.) Treats of brain-axis (human brains must be measured dif- ferently from those of animals), ques- tions to be investigated, technique of measurement, hardening of brain, casts of skull, etc. At the suggestion of Dr Ranke a committee on the anthropolo- gical study of the brain was appointed. Robin (P.) Projet de questions a adresser aux sujets photographiques. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, ve s., IV, 546. ) Brief list of questions for data concerning persons photographed. Sanielevici (Dr) Le travail de la masti- cation est la cause de la brachycephalie. (Ibid., 593-595.) Against Nystr6m, the author considers dolichocephaly the norm and brachycephaly (in the Mongol) the variation or abnormality, produced by the process of mastication exaggerated in a normal race of the Asiatic steppes. Dr Sanielevici assumes, without right, that all Mongols are broad-heads. Sclavunos (G.) Ueber die Ventrikular- sdicke des Kehlkopfes bei erwachsenen und neugeborenen Menschen sowie bei einigen Affen. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1904, xxIV, 511-523, 12 figs.) Resumes the author's detailed study published in the Epeteris of the University of Athens for 1903. Dr ScIavunos found 3 cases of the ventricular sack in 500 corpses of adults. Their presence in the older anthropoids he considers partly due to the need for temperature-protection. v. Sebesty6n (G.) Ursprung der Bustro- phedonschrift. (Z f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1903, xxv, 755-77 I, 12 figs.) Author holds the score-stick to be the oldest writing material, cutting into soft wood covering before scratching into stone or metal. The Mediterranean alphabet was originally "notch-writing " (examples of this, particularly from the East Siberian Ostiaks). The ancient boustrophedon is "merely a notch-writing indirectly pre- served to the present time." The notch- writing was later copied on stone and other material. Seggel (Dr) Ueber das Verhiltnis von Sch~del und Gehirnentwickelung zum Lingenwachsthum des K6rpers. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1903, N. F., I, 1-25, 2 figs., curves, tables.) Discusses growth in height, pupil-distance (base- line), relation of stature-growth to pupil- distance, of pupil-distance to skull and brain. Dr Seggel concludes that the measurement of the base-line affords a certain criterion for the development of the frontal lobes of the cerebrum and so for the development of the intellectual faculties. The absence of a base-line adequately corresponding to the growth in stature, or exceeding this (the danger period is from the thirteenth to the seven- teenth year), indicates that intellectual pressure must be avoided. Smith (G. E.) The morphology of the occipital region of the cerebral hemi- sphere in man and the apes. (Anat. Anz., Jena, 1904, xxIV, 436-451, 9 figs.) Based on some 400 human and 400 simian hemispheres. The non-hom- ology in man and ape and of the " cal- carine " sulci is shown. The results of Dr Smith's investigations will appear in detail in vol. II of Records of the Egyp- tian School of Medicine. - Note on the so-called "transitory fissures" of the human brain, with special reference to Bischoff's " Fissura perpendicularis externa." (Ibid., 216- 220o, 2 figs.) From examination of fetal brain, author concludes that "the so- called 'transitory fissures' are merely indentations which are produced post- mortem. " Stratz (C. H.) Der Werth der Len- dengegend f'ir anthropologische und ob- stetrische Messungen. (A. f. Anthr., Brnschwg., 1902-1903, XXVII, 117-128, 4 pl., 15 figs.) Compares the sexes and discusses normal variations in particular, - based on special study of 20 women and men. The Kreuzgriibchen is more marked in women, and the level of the region deeper.</page><page sequence="5">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 347 Stratz den Haag (C. H.) Das Problem der Rasseneinteilung der Menschheit. (Ibid., 19o3, N. F., I, 189-200, I fig., map.) Discusses the division of man- kind into races, with reference to theories of Fritsch, Klaatsch, et al. Stratz holds that the earliest form of man was closely related to the aboriginal Australians; from this type developed the white, the yellow being the youngest of the three great races. The Negrito is a combina- tion of the black and the yellow. The marks of the so-called "protomorphic" races are treated with some detail. Toldt (C.) Ueber die aussere K6rper- form zwei verschieden grosser Embry- onen von Macacus cyno. (Ibid., 1903, xxvI, 277-287, 2 figs.) Details of de- scription and measurement, comparison with those of Deniker and Duckworth. Macaque foetus nearer to human than to gorilla, exhibits same striking differences as between human and gorilla ; macaque facially more like human. von Ujfalvy (C.) Ziele und Aufgaben meiner Forschungen auf dem Gebiete der historischen Anthropologie. (Ibid., 26-29.) Resumes his iconographic-an- thropological investigations in relation to the "Aryan question " and the works of the "Gobinean school," Reibmayr, H. Chamberlain, Zaborowski, Ammon, Wil- ser, Penka, et al. The author sees " a deep gulf" between the Hindus and Iranians,-today they are racially dif- ferent. The primitive Aryan of Ujfalvy is tall, blond, blue-eyed, light-skinned, leptoprosopic, and leptorrhine. Virchow (H.) Die Verwendung von Ab- giissen bei der Herstellung von Skelett- prliparaten. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1903, xxxv, 793-796.) From twenty year's experience as an anatomist, the author argues for the use of casts in the setting up of skeletons, e. g., of the foot. Weidenreich (F.) Die Bildung des Kinnes und seine angebliche Beziehung zur Sprache. Anat. Anz., Jena, 1904, XXIV, 545-555, 5 figs.) Author holds that the chin in man is simply a result of the reduction of the teeth and of the alveolar region. Argues against Walk- hoff. Welcker (H.) und Brandt (A.) Ge- wichtswerthe der K5rperorgane bei dem Menschen und den Thieren. (Ibid., i- 89, 42 tables.) This monograph, with bibliography of go titles, treats of weight of skin, fat, brain, spinal marrow, eye, heart, arteries, lungs, thymus, thyroid, spleen, renal capsules, tongue, salivary glands, pancreas, bowels, liver, mesen- tery, kidneys, sexual glands, genitals, blood, etc., in normal adult man, mon- keys and numerous other animals, birds, reptiles, amphibia, fish, etc. The con- clusion is reached that a large animal is never the simple magnification of a small one. All vegetative organs show their maximum figure in small animals, mini- mum in those of average size and in the largest. Whittaker (T. P.) Alcoholic beverages and longevity. (Contemp. R., Lond., 1904, 413-429.) Discusses statistics, 184o-19oI. Difference in favor of total abstainers have increased during last twenty years. EUROPE Arnold (J. L.) Das "Giritzenmoos " in Dagmersellen, Kt. Luzern. (Schweiz. Arch. f. Volksk., Ziirich, 1903, VII, 295-298.) Describes a carnival cere- mony performed some 40 years ago at Dagmersellen in the canton of Luzerne. A sort of mock trial of "old maids," carried on by the youth of the village. Asmus (R.) Die Schadelform der alt- wendischen Bev61kerung Mecklenburgs. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1902, xxvII, 1-36, 2 pl., 4 tables.) Detailed study of 50 old Wend skulls from various parts of Mecklenburg (29 percent dolichocephalic, 18.7 percent brachy- cephalic; av. cubic cap., male 1432-5, female 1261 c.c. ). Race-mixture is indi- cated,-original dolichocephalic Slavonic type with brachycephalic Anaryan (?) type,-removing the Mecklenburg branch from the pure type represented by the old Polish population of West Prussia. Aus den Arbeiten der Deutschen Orient- gesellschaft. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1903, LXXXIV, 241-242.) Resum6s accounts of excavations in Fara and Abu Hatal, southeast of Babylon ; and Abusir, Egypt.

Le bijou en forme d'or- ganes humains : le coeur vend6en. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, ve S., IV, 607-612.) Treats of the "Vendean heart,"-ancient and modern forms, in metal, cloth (in the wars), etc.,-which the author thinks is derived from the cir- cular ring, and may be ultimately of Spanish origin. This note r~sum~s Bau- doin and Lacouloumbre's Le ceur ven- dten (Paris, 19o3). Blind (E.) ElsAssische Steinzeitbevalk- erung. (Corr.-Bl. d. deutschen Ges. f.

With metals the present domi- nant brachycephalic population appeared. Today more than 75 per cent. is broad- headed. Bloch (A.) Origine turque des Bulgares. (Bull. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1903, ve s., IV, 537-546.) Historical discus- sion (partly on basis of Arabian writers). Author thinks that the Volga Bulgarians who invaded Moesia were absorbed by the indigenous Slavs. The upper lip and nose of Bulgarian women are said to belong to the old physical type. Bi5ckel (G.) Volksrstsel aus dem Vogels- berg. (Hess. Bl. f. Volksk., Leipzig, 1903, II, 222-224.) Texts of 59 folk- riddles from Vogelsberg.

Paris, 1904, Ne s., I, 552-558.) Except Ireland, Italy loses a greater proportion of her population by emigration than any other European country. One-fourth of the permanent emigration comes from Campania and half of the temporary emigration from Venetia. The 'duality of Italy is well exemplified in her emigration. Cook (A. B.) Les galets peints du Mas- d'Azil. (L'Anthropologie, Paris, 1903, xiv, 655-660, 4 figs.) Compares the painted pebbles of Mas-d'Azil with churinga ('"totem ") of certain Aus- tralian tribes, often indistinguishable from the "bull-roarer." The conven- tional red daubs are what would be ex- pected in an age of artistic decadence, to which, according to Cook, these objects in prehistoric France belong. Daleau (F. Colliers modernes pour facili- ter 1'6mission des dents des enfants. (Soc. Arch6ol. de Bordeaux, 19oo-19IO, XXIII, 129-131.)

Ant., Padova, 1904, VII, repr. pp. 6. ) Critique of recent litera- ture on the Siculi and Pelasgians, par- ticularly De Cara's Gli Hethei-Pelasgi (Roma, 1902). The author holds that the facts of anthropology cannot say whether the Siculi before entering Sicily were Anaryan, Aryanized, or Aryan, though it is probable that the Aryan van- guard (or better the peoples Aryanized in speech), such as the Ligurians, e. g., were somatically, and in customs very similar to the Anaryans. The .Hamitic invasion of the Mediterranean admitted by De Cara must have been considerably posterior to the Eurafrican invasion of Sergi, which followed the Neanderthal- Spy race very closely. The craniological affinities of the Mediterranean peoples are decidedly anterior to the "Hittite- Pelasgian " expansion. Hahn (E.) Knochenfunde von der bel- gischen Kiiste. (Z. f.

Meaning of Shan, ethnographic notes on the Taung- thu, Taungyo, Intha of Lake Inle, Padaungs, red Karens of Loikaw, etc. The rowing of the Intha is rather acro- batic. The Shans have a higher esthetic sense than the Burmese. The Karen house is on piles. The Selungs, Dr Fischer thinks, are not civilisationsfiidhig. Foy (W.) Beitrag zur Kenntnis der Chaldaer. (Ibid., 752-755.) Criticises adversely Oppert's rapprochement of Chalkis, Chalkide and Greek ';xa?'xeOi (" blacksmith"), and the ideas of Gold- stein on the same topic.

R6sum6s a recent article in the Mercure de France with this title by Alexandra Myrial. The monk and nun idea is really exotic in China, where the family is the basis of social life and activities, and is of Budd- histic provenance. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLYNESIA Bauer (F.) Ueber Schadel von den Phil- ippinen. (A. f. Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1902-1903, xxvII, 107-I116, 9 figs.)

Dr Bauer calls attention (as did Virchow) to the resemblance of the type (as shown by indices) of Philippine skulls with those of Peruvians. It is possible that some of the skulls called Philippine originally belonged to Peruvian slaves introduced by the Spaniards. Born (Dr) Einige ethnologische Noti- zen aus Jap. (Z. f. Ethnol., Leipzig, 1903, xxxv, 929-930.) Brief notes on the lowering of canoe-masts with shaman- istic ceremonies, the natives of Feys island, relations between Mapia and Jap.

Dr Bartels, on the authority of mission- ary Stecker, adds the Eskimo of the Kuskokwim region in Alaska to the people among whom " Mongol spots" occur. Beauchamp (W. M.) Reply to "Who made the Bone Combs ?" (Ann. Arch. Rep., 1903, Toronto, 1904, 85-86.) Argues that bone combs, except in Jef- ferson co., N. Y., are not earlier than the year I6oo, and that the Indian had his idea of making the comb from European examples. Birch (F.) The "Standing Rock." (Ibid., 98-xox.) Disagrees with Father Jones' location of the " Standing Rock" of the Jesuit Relations, and claims to have discovered it at the place known as "Indian Caves," some 5Y4 miles north. Borba (T. M.)

Rep., 1903, To- ronto, 1904, 27-35.) Critique of Mr Joseph D. McGuire's views on the Euro- pean origin of "4Indian " effigy pipes, as expressed in his Pipes and Smoking Customs of the American Aborigines. See McGUIRE. Mr Boyle thinks the in- ventive capacity of the Indian sufficient to account for many pipes thought to be European. The working of native copper. (Ibid., 36-43.) Discusses views of Moore and McGuire and concludes that " there would seem to be no doubt that copper manipulation was practised by the Indians long before the discovery, and that the invention, or application of the socket, as well as the use of a tying- hole, in connection with arrow and spear- heads, is wholly due to aboriginal inge- nuity or adaptiveness." - Working methods. (Ibid., 48-85, 51 figs.) Treats of unfinished and finished stone pipes, clay pipes, stone axes, slate knives, slate pendant, stone gouges, pebble gorget, how the Indian mended stone, stone files or steel files, some mechanical methods, bone and horn, who made the bone combs? Ar- gues that the Indian method of work ex- hibited in many of these implements and instruments of itself precludes imitation of European models with European tools. Evidence as to the use of a steel file is deceptive. Against Beauchamp, Boyle credits the Indians with making bone combs. European contact and metallic tools were not necessary to produce them. A shell neck-lace. A few copper tools. A brass smoking pipe. Bored skulls. A burial place in Onondaga township. A good piece of work in stone. (Ibid., 87-95, 11 figs.) De- scribes a necklace from York county, representing three periods of time and workmanship (probably in part evidenc- ing European influence) ; a copper fish- hook from Isle Royale (the only one in the museum); a brass pipe from Onon- daga probably made by a white man; two Indian skulls from Lambton county, one with six, the other with three post- mortem perforations. The burial place contained 16 graves, the remains found in which indicate a period about 1700oo- 1750. The stone object cited is a finely made pestle from Comox, B. C. - British Columbia mummies.

Gives ex- tracts from the court copy of the evidence in the trial of Payoo and Napayoosee, Cree Indians of Smoky river, 75 miles from Little Slave lake, for having in 1899 killed Moostoos, a member of their tribe, who declared himself a wehtigoo (wendigo) or "one possessed." Brown (C. E.) The native copper im- plements of Wisconsin. (Wisc. Archeol., Milwaukee, 1904, III, 49-86, 12 pl.) Treats of source, mining, fabrication, distribution, classes and function. Axes, hatchets, chisels, spuds, gouges, adzes, spiles, spatulas, knives, spear and arrow points, harpoon points, pikes and punches, awls and drills, spikes, needles, fish-hooks, peculiar implements are de- scribed. The number of Wisconsin cop- per implements is very large; the Law- son catalogue lists i3,ooo and the collecting of 30 years has not exhausted the supply. Glacial or "float" copper was used as well as the Lake Superior metal. No evidence of a "lost art " is present. As compared with village sites and fields, Wisconsin mounds and graves furnish few specimens. A good paper. Casanowicz (I. M.) Oriental and class- ical archeology in the United States National Museum. (Rec. of Past, Wash., 1903, I., 355-361, 7 figs.)

Firstemann (E.) Zur Madrider Maya- handschrift. (Z. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1903, xxxv, 771-790, 7 figs.) Dis- cusses in detail certain figures of days in Tro-Cortesianus 65-72. Author argues that the 32 day-groups of 6 hieroglyphs each, which occur in addition to the 8 columns of 32 hieroglyphs, belong to the eighth and last column of these. Gibbons (J.) Iroquois in the Northwest Territories. (Ann. Arch. Rep., 190o3, Toronto, 1904, 125-126.) Brief note on "Michel's Band," near Edmonton Alberta, now "Indians" only in name. Hamilton (J. C.) The Algonquin Mana- bozho and Hiawatha. (J. Amer. Folk- Lore, Boston, 1903, xv, 229-233.)

Harris (W. R.) The Caribs of Guiana and the West Indies. (Ann. Arch. Rep., 1903, Toronto, 1904, 139-145.) Brief historical account with ethnographic notes, etc., habits, customs, chiefly from old authorities. Their councils of war are said to have been "held in a secret dialect or jargon, in which the women were never initiated" - besides there were different dialects for men and women, so an " educated " Carib needed really to speak three languages. Hunter (A. F.) Indian village sites in North and South Orillia townships. (Ibid., 105-125, map.) After general account of sites, burials, trails (Muskoka, Coldwater, Huron, Atherley), the author catalogues, with brief statements of situa- tion, contents, etc., twelve sites in North and twenty-one in South Orilla, besides the fishing-station at the Narrows (be- longing to the Hurons). The Orillias contain the line of contact between the Hurons and the Algonkins of the Jesuit Relations, and the author says, "what I am inclined to call the Algonkin sites have distinct characters, and might al- most be said to preponderate over the Huron sites in the Orillia townships." The Algonkian sites show abundance of stone and pottery disks, individual bur- ials, highly decorated pipes and pottery, greater abundance of bone needles, awls, etc., of flints, etc., also brass arrow- heads made from fragments of old kettles. The Mount Slaven site close to Orillia is described in considerable detail, - it is not Cahiagu6, as some have thought.</page><page sequence="17">CHAMBERLAIN] PERIODICAL LITERATURE 359 von Ihering (H.)

Anthrop., Brnschwg., 1902, XXVII, 582-597, 4 figs.) Concludes that the evidence shows that the man of the southern Pata- gonian caves, slew, skinned, cut up and ate raw the great edentate ( Grypother- ium), which may have been a kind of domestic animal. The remains of an extinct species (Onohippidium) of horse are such as to indicate its use as food by cave-man. The Grypotherium was probably exterminated by man in histor- ical times. See Amer.

The relation of coitus and birth to the mimic acts in the ceremonies of various peoples connected with spring, harvest, growth, fertilization, etc., are considered, the phallic basis of many demonstrated, and the role of coitus in the activity of many deities pointed out. Very curious is the</page><page sequence="18">360 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 6, 1904 development of the phallic demon as actor, including the clowns of Shake- speare, descendants of the ancient mimic fools.
