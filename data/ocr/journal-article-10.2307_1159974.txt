<plain_text><page sequence="1">Africa 53(3), 1983 DREAMS OF POWER: SOCIAL PROCESS IN A WEST AFRICAN RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT Richard T. Curley In the present paper we shall describe the ways in which dreams are regarded by the members of a West African religious sect and explain how dreams figure in the social organization of the sect. Our point of departure will be largely sociological, and in this respect our study differs from most anthropological writings on dreams. The dream narrations which we are considering arise as much out of the social organization of the sect as from the psyche of the individuals. Furthermore, the narrations are public performances and are evaluated by members of the sect for the purpose of situating each other within the community of church members. The narrations are used by church members to demonstrate the depth of their religious commitment and to assist them in competing for key roles within the church. Thus dreams ace important as indicators of a person's worth and as instruments of social mobility. Following Charsley's treatment of dreams in a Ugandan independent church we will not focus on the use of dreams as a 'privileged channel of insight into the culture' (1973: 244), although the themes and symbols which are described in the narratives can indeed reveal much about the beliefs of church members and suggest ways in which their beliefs might guide their behaviour. It is appropriate to discuss some of these themes and symbols en route to our objective, and in doing so it will be possible to shed some light on the teachings of the sect and on the mentality of many of its members. It is important to state, however, that the primary data of this study are not accounts of dreams such as those that might be told privately to an analyst or an ethnographer. Rather they are mostly accounts which people present in public at church services. They are sometimes retold, embellished and circulated throughout the community of church members. Thus the data are speech events which are often used instrumentally by the narrator, sometimes for the purpose of ennobling the self and sometimes for the purpose of praising the sect. This means that one would have to question the authenticity of the narratives if one were to use them as windows into the minds of church members. We are on safer ground if we view the narratives of dreams as public performances which are patterned in accordance with the expectations of the church community and which have an effect on social action within that community. In order to explain the orientation of this study it might be helpful to consider some of the ways in which dreams have been treated in anthropology and in the study of African religious movements. Perhaps the most extensive consideration of dreams within anthropology has been in the psychoanalytic tradition. At the height of 'culture and personality' studies anthropologists often collected data on dreams in order to understand the personalities of individuals and to identify certain features of a culture which might help to form a personality which was seen as being typical of that culture. Geza Roheim's early work among Australian aborigines, Somalis and Yuma Indians (1932) involved collecting accounts of dreams along with other types of data. The dreams were viewed as a new type of data which would enable the anthropologist to identify the ways in which the psyche can project itself on to the cultural scene. Other students of culture and personality have used dreams</page><page sequence="2">DREAMS OF POWER differently and in a less strictly psychoanalytic way. A number of anthropologists collected or elicited life histories of key informants, and these histories sometimes contained accounts of dreams which seemed to offer the anthropologist a fuller and more intimate knowledge of the individual informant rather than providing the data for a psychoanalytic interpretation of the culture which the informant represented (Simmons, 1942; Dyk, 1938; Radin, 1920). Dreams have also been treated as a form of privileged data which offer special clues as to modes of thought or to significant recurring themes in a cultural system. The dream is likely to present the ethnographer with material which is not readily accessible through conventional elicitation or observation, and dreams can be used in much the same way that Thematic Apperception Tests or Rorschach tests have sometimes been used. Many ethnographers have taken this approach, using dreams not because they wish to interpret them psychoanalytically but because the dreams can provide information on topics which interest the ethnographer (Eggan, 1952; Colby, 1963). An example of this sort of study is LeVine's Dreams and Deeds, which is primarily an attempt to understand the high level of motivation which has frequently been attributed to the Igbo. LeVine used accounts of dreams along with other sorts of data to investigate this particular problem (LeVine, 1966). Apart from those who have used dreams as a tool for understanding psychological issues, the anthropologists who have been most interested in dreams have been students of religion, for the obvious reason that people often attribute dreams to spiritual forces and believe that dreams can reveal information about the spiritual realm which is not ascertainable by other means. Thus dreams have been associated with spirit possession, shamanism, and divination, and dreams are often used as a form of exegesis to clarify the meanings of certain religious symbols (Buxton 1973; Evans-Pritchard 1956; Berglund 1975). In a passage describing Zulu religion, M'Timkulu offers some comments which would apply to a large number of African religious traditions: Dreams are the context in which the spirit, or soul, or shadow, sometimes leaves the body and goes to live temporarily in other sections of the spiritual world from which it may then bring back a message. Dreams can thus be very important sources of information and guidance; they provide one situation in which living human beings have contact with the spiritual world (M'Timkulu, 1977: 17). This passage calls attention to the single most important belief concerning dreams: people are likely to view dreams as channels of communication - albeit one-way channels - enabling spiritual beings to reveal themselves to certain individuals. The dream serves especially well in instances in which a religious leader, or would-be religious leader, wishes to introduce some new interpretation of the spiritual realm or its laws. Prophets are often said to have received their message in a dream, and the interpretation of the dream becomes a key element in the teachings of the sect. Scholars who have studied religious movements have noted the importance of the dream as a means of legitimizing the message of the prophet (Wallace, 1956; LaBarre, 1972; Daneel, 1970; Thomas 1977: 277). Dreaming may be further incorporated into the life of the sect when it is regarded as a communicative link between spiritual beings and ordinary members of the sect. In such cases the dream may not only figure into the original charter of the sect, but may have become a 21</page><page sequence="3">DREAMS OF POWER regular part of the sect's activity. This is the case in some of the independent Christian sects which are so abundant on African soil, and observers have noted that dream narration is a regular part of the church services and that various procedures have been devised for interpreting dream narrations (Sundkler, 1961; 1976: 276; Peel, 1968). Most anthropologists who have studied these churches have not dealt systematically with dreams but have treated them as incidental to other topics such as the nature of the prophet's message or the form of the religious service. One notable exception is a study by Charsley which deals with the relationship between dream narration and the social life of a small Christian sect in Western Uganda (Charsley, 1973). The present study follows the line of enquiry suggested by Charsley: we shall pay as much attention to the act of recounting the dream as to the dream's contents, and we shall consider that the dream narration offers evidence of social relations within the church community. Above all we hope to show that dreams have several different uses and meanings and can be used to understand various features of the social life of the church. To accomplish these ends we must describe certain features of the social organization of the sect and show the contexts in which dreams are narrated; we are interested in the aims of those who narrate their dreams and in the effects which these narrations might have on the church community. THE SECT The True Church of God is an evangelistic, fundamentalist Christian church which originated in eastern Nigeria in 1953. It has expanded to a membership of about 5000 persons belonging to 125 separate branches in Nigeria and Cameroon. Historically the church has had occasional dealings with English, German and American missionaries who have used its organization as the setting for revivalistic crusades, but none of these missionaries appear to have left a strong mark on the church. Like most African independent churches, the True Church of God must be seen as an authentically African form of Christianity. It has selected particular concepts from Christianity, and it has borrowed many of its organizational features from the Protestant missionary churches which were established in eastern Nigeria. The present study is based on a first hand acquaintance with two small branches of the True Church of God located in Southwest Province of the Republic of Cameroon.2 Since all but five of the 125 branches are located in Nigeria, and since the Cameroonian branches are regarded as outposts of the Nigerian church, there are certain difficulties in using the Cameroonian data to generalize about the church as a whole. However, the sect has instituted a number of means of centralizing its control and standardizing the teachings and activities of the various branches. The basic message of the church is that people can attain salvation by making an emotional commitment to Christ and by submitting one's self to the authority of the church leaders who are said to be God's representatives. The church leaders are also believed to have a religious faith which is so strong that it can inspire people to reorganize their lives, follow the injunctions of the church, and keep their religious commitment strong and active. In describing the core of belief of the church it is important to emphasize the emotional rather than the intellectual nature of the commitment. Apart from the Bible there is no formal body of knowledge or coherent 22</page><page sequence="4">DREAMS OF POWER set of theological teachings. The core of belief is the Bible, and church members are asked to study it diligently and to interpret it quite literally. Church leaders often include biblical exegesis in their sermons, but the exegetical interpretations are inconsistent and are not derived from an official established doctrine. Other than the Bible the most important teachings are the injunctions or rules which members are to follow if they are to translate their emotional commitment into active church membership. What seems to be lacking are systematic discussions of the nature of divinity, the relationship between God and man, or any eschatological ideas. Nevertheless, sermons and the statements of church members enable us to get some idea of the ways in which divinity is conceived. The conception of God is largely anthropomorphic, and God is described as a powerful, authoritarian father-figure. Christ is sometimes described in more benign terms, but little distinction is made between different manifestations of the deity. The proper relationship between man and God requires a fervent outpouring of prayer, dancing and singing as a demonstration that one's faith is real. The ultimate rewards for this sort of devotion are believed to be attained in the afterlife, but, in fact, church participation and the joys of religious belief are thought to be rewarding in their own right, and church members display very little concern for the afterlife. In this sense the True Church of God is not a transcendental religion, but is largely oriented towards the present world, for piety is believed to bestow very important benefits, including material benefits, on the believer during his lifetime. God can intervene on behalf of believers by ensuring prosperity, personal safety and a closely knit and contented family. These, of course, are the real concerns of daily life, and the relationship of such concerns to religious faith comprise the principal topics in the discourse of the church. Foremost among these concerns is the matter of health and the treatment of illness. Church members are strictly forbidden to take medicine or use any form of therapy other than prayer. This is undoubtedly the most important of all the church's rules, and it figures very prominently in the view of the church which is held by non-members. The rule can be understood when one considers that in most African societies, including those located in urban areas, the most prevalent explanations of disease are spiritual rather than secular. The explanations include such well-known phenomena as spirit possession or witchcraft, and therapy is often effected by religious practitioners. Even herbalists selling their wares in the relative anonymity of the marketplace describe their herbs in magical terms. By refusing to allow its members to purchase medicines or seek cures outside the church the True Church of God is eliminating the dependence which its members might otherwise have on non-Christian magical forces. At the same time the church is itself gaining control over its members, because their physical well-being is dependent on the blessings and healing power of the church. This dependence is seen most dramatically at the healing ceremonies which are held for sick members, particularly in cases of serious illness. Like many religious movements the True Church of God has developed procedures which assist the congregation in accommodating their behaviour as closely as possible to the ideals and rules of the sect. Behaviour becomes consistent with teaching so that there is a quality of unity or integration to the lives of church members (Jules-Rosette, 1975: 53).3 One of the principal means by which this 23</page><page sequence="5">uniformity is accomplished is by modelling the congregation after New Testament ideals and by fostering an egalitarian community of people who are genuinely concerned for one another's welfare. The metaphor of kinship is used consistently to describe the spirit which should animate all relations among church members. The women are all addressed as 'sister' and the men as 'brother' after they have been baptized or have shown that they intend to be baptized. The solicitousness and spirit of cooperation which church members display towards one another is truly remarkable and extends to economic assistance, including the sharing of some services and foodstuffs. The church members show special concern towards those who are sick, and a member may take it upon herself to mobilize a group to assist a member who is in need. The sect is very nearly a total institution except that its members do not live within its walls and must earn their living outside the church. Because there are only sixty-five members of the Tiko branch of the True Church of God, and because none of the members occupies a very high status in the larger community, they cannot count on each other for valuable support in finding jobs or dealing with officials. They generally have their most unpleasant and threatening experiences in the context of their work or in their dealings with neighbours. They take steps to minimize interaction with non-members by trying to live as closely as possible to one another. But the residential quarters of Tiko are crowded and sprawling, and their efforts to live together in a single neighbourhood have not been successful. In the face of these threats to the integrity of the congregation, the church was able to purchase a plot of land, measuring about one acre, which it hopes to develop as a residential quarter which will house and feed the present membership of the church. The land is to be cultivated communally, and the plans for the enterprise are described in utopian terms. This is an example of the great effort on the part of both church leaders and members to organize their lives in such a way that their behaviour can conform to the teachings of the church and to minimize interaction with outsiders. In spite of the egalitarian ideals of the church and its communal nature, some church members are accorded greater respect than others. A great amount of deference is shown to the leader who exerts authority over the congregation in virtually every aspect of their lives. The leader of the Tiko branch has the title of 'elder', which is one of the official statuses in the hierarchy of the church. The elder is assisted by three exemplary men who have been rewarded for their service to the church and for their faith with the title of'deacon'. There are a number of additional titles such as 'sexton' and 'beadle', but the three deacons rank just below the elder in the church hierarchy. The deacons sit on a special bench at the front of the church, they assist in conducting the service, and they lead the service when the elder is absent. They also pray on behalf of sick people if the elder is not available and, although they are said to lack the healing power of the elder, their powers are thought to be greater than those of other church members. The status of deacon is somewhat ambiguous in that the deacon is chosen because he is particularly pious and should serve as an example to others, but the status confers no real authority. Yet the deacon is a potential authority figure because elders are always appointed from the ranks of deacons, so each deacon, theoretically, has the opportunity to attain a rank which would actually give him some real authority over the congregation. If an elder were 24 DREAMS OF POWER</page><page sequence="6">DREAMS OF POWER to be removed from office, die, retire, or become incapacitated, a deacon would be appointed to take his place. This is not the place to describe the hierarchical organization of authority within the True Church of God, which is governed by a Bishop in Nigeria. We can summarize the organization by noting that there is very little room for upward mobility on the part of those who aspire to be clergymen. There are really no special skills or forms of training which a church leader must have beyond an ability to speak effectively and lead the congregation. Leaders are not chosen on the basis of their healing powers, for they are believed to acquire those powers after being appointed to their offices. In short, almost any man who is a member of the church is a potential leader, and there are some subtle forms of competition among the men in the church. We shall return to this issue later when we discuss the significance of dreams in the church, but one additional aspect of the inequality among church members needs to be mentioned. Women are not allowed to have positions of leadership and do not hold titles other than 'sister'. There are many more opportunities for the males in the church to be rewarded for their zeal and service with the recognition which comes through a title such as deacon or sexton. The ideal of the church is that of an undifferentiated community, and women come much closer to meeting that ideal than men. So far this brief background description of the church has dwelled on the utopian, familistic ideal of the community of believers who passionately accept Christian teachings as interpreted by the leaders of the church and who strive to lead their own lives in accord with their beliefs; yet the church's ability to operate strictly according to its own ideals is hampered by subtle forms of inequality among the membership. ATTITUDES TOWARDS DREAMS Members of the sect hold attitudes toward dreams which are generally consistent with their egalitarian values; any members of the church can have contact with the spiritual realm through dreams, and most church members have dreams from time to time which they can narrate to others. The narrator can command the attention of others while narrating dreams because dreams are not considered to be a reflection of the state of mind of the individual; the dream is a truthful representation and is likely to contain information which will be valuable for all members of the church. Once it has been told, the dream becomes public property, but a particularly vivid or important dream confers respect on the narrator. The very experience of dreaming is regarded as a sign of faith and helps to affirm one's membership in the congregation. Church members are encouraged to recite their dreams publicly and in the course of our observations all but three members recounted their dreams in the church meetings. Children were also allowed to recount their dreams, although only four of the thirty non-adult members did so publicly. This is in keeping with a lower level of participation on the part of children and their reticence in making public presentations. Almost everyone experiences dreams. Some dreams are explicit and the religious meaning is apparent to virtually every listener as soon as the dream is told. Other dreams are less explicit, they may not contain any overtly religious content and may be entirely secular in nature. If such a dream is to have any value as a statement of 25</page><page sequence="7">DREAMS OF POWER faith or as a lesson it must be interpreted in such a way as to extract its religious meaning. This is usually done by the elder of the congregation who, after listening to the narration, stands up and offers his own interpretation. Sometimes, instead of the elder, one of the deacons will interpret a dream, and the interpretation is usually presented as an instruction to the congregation. One of the most interesting aspects of the process of interpretation is the way in which it transforms one of the most private forms of experience, the dream, into public property. Members of the church can be said to have a stake in each other's dreams. But the interpretation of dreams raises certain problems with respect to the matter of equality among church members, since it offers the leaders of the church an opportunity to assert their authority and demonstrate that they have a greater knowledge than others in the congregation. It should also be noted that it is not uncommon for the narrator to offer his or her own interpretation following the narration. This in turn sets the stage for one of the church leaders to present a different interpretation which will carry greater authority than that of the narrator. Dreams which make clear statements about the spiritual realm or contain explicitly religious symbols which can be understood in a straightforward manner are more highly valued and greater importance is attached to them because they are seen as direct religious experiences or as communication with God. The dream which contains religious images demonstrates that the narrator has been in touch with God, whereas a dream which is devoid of religious content is regarded as a message. The latter type of dream, when properly interpreted, may offer a clue which will help to solve some past or present problem. It may also offer a glimpse into the future, and, in this way, dreams can serve as an informal divination procedure. Dreams can be truthful, even if they are strictly secular; they are taken as true because they are believed to have been inspired by the Holy Spirit, which is said to be the force behind all dreams. Dreams may not contain images of the spiritual realm, but their ultimate source is religious nevertheless. Dreams which lack religious images are less highly valued because the individual who experiences such dreams is seen as being a passive vessel through whom the truth is being revealed. When the dream contains religious symbols, however, the dream is seen as being in a much more active relationship with the spiritual world. We have noted that the church leaders are capable of giving more authoritative interpretations than most of the church members, and therefore the task of interpreting is related to the status hierarchy within the church community. But there is another more fundamental way in which the different types of dreams are related to the standing of church members. Those people who can describe vivid religious images such as Christ on the cross, a church on fire, or a biblical scene are regarded as being more devout. Images of this sort are taken as prima facie evidence of holiness. These attitudes lead to a competition among the narrators of dreams and among those who interpret the dreams. Dreams are important from an experiential point of view, particularly in a church which emphasizes the importance of direct communication with God through dancing, prayer and an outpouring of religious fervour. Members place a particularly high value on dreaming because they feel that it is the one form of communication with God which is initiated by God. A common attitude towards dreams is one of gratitude: God is reciprocating in the communication process. 26</page><page sequence="8">DREAMS OF POWER We have noted that dreams differ with regard to their content, and we now need to look more closely at the contexts in which dreams are used. We found that dreams were narrated during services and that dreams were an essential part of the conversion experience of each member. No doubt church members dreamt many dreams which were not used in these ways, and individuals sometimes recount their dreams to one another in private. On several occasions informants described dreams to me, sometimes in a casual manner, and sometimes in such a way as to demonstrate their religious commitment. But we are interested in the ways in which dreams figure in the public life of the church and, because the contents per se are of less concern to us, we shall omit discussion of private dream narrations and consider the public uses in conversion and in church services.4 CONVERSION DREAMS All of the adult members of the True Church of God joined the church as adults. None of the members of the Tiko branch converted from an evangelical Christian religious background, which is another way of saying that all of them experienced a radical change in their way of looking at the world when they joined, and membership for each of them required drastic alterations in personal habits. Our earlier sketch of the church described how it operates as a total institution but did not adequately convey a sense of the fervour and emotional zeal with which people get swept up. The fervour is reflected in the number of hours which church members spend attending services. The list of services includes one hour of prayer at seven each morning, a brief noon prayer session, an hour in the late afternoon, a two-hour session early in the evening, and an hour at midnight. There is an obligatory four-hour work party each Wednesday, and the Sunday service takes five hours, with another two or three hours given over to Sunday school. Not everyone attends all of these sessions, but the members spend an average of fourteen hours a week attending formal church meetings. When we consider that church meetings are very high-pitched and emotionally intensive with outpourings of prayer and dancing, we get some idea of the amount of energy which each member invests in the church. Individuals find this experience highly gratifying, and they describe the rewards with reference to their conversions, contrasting their present condition with the emptiness of their lives prior to conversion. A typical convert is introduced to the church when he is faced with a critical problem which cannot be solved by conventional means. Sickness is the most common of these problems and is probably the best example. The sick person may attend the church and find himself the object of a great deal of attention from the congregation. Not only do they offer prayers, but they are likely to offer other forms of support such as providing food, caring for young children, or loaning very small sums of money. The initiate may consent to undergo 'instruction', which consists mostly of learning a set of directives. He may then be baptized, but he will not pass through any of these stages if he does not show signs of piety. Perhaps the clearest indication of a person's religious commitment is a vision which comes to him in the form of a dream. We can illustrate the conversion process with two examples. 27</page><page sequence="9">DREAMS OF POWER Victoria Victoria is thirty years old with three young children, the oldest of whom is seven years of age. She is an Igbo and grew up in eastern Nigeria; she attended school up to the fifth grade. Both of her parents were Roman Catholics, and she attended the Catholic church and a Catholic missionary school. When she was eighteen years old she married a young farmer and lived with him in her parents' village for three years. The marriage was unsuccessful; Victoria claims that her first husband was a drunkard and that she became depressed because she did not have any children. She left her husband and went to visit a married female cousin in Tiko where she met an Igbo man, began to live with him, and by whom she bore her first child when she was twenty-three. Following the birth of a second child she began to be sickly and prone to nervous disorders. Her former husband in Nigeria was sending threatening messages to her at that time and her family had disowned her. Her physical and mental condition deteriorated to the point where she was incapable of dealing with people and accomplishing necessary tasks. Her second husband consulted physicians, but they were unable to help her. She turned to non-western healers and herbalists and experimented with various folk medicines. This sickness and the attempts to be cured contihued for over a year, and one night her husband brought her to a prayer meeting of the True Church of God. The church is well known for its policy on medicines, and many people in Tiko believe that the church has effective healing powers. In any case church members prayed over Victoria on seven or eight separate occasions, and she soon found herself getting up to dance. On the night before she was to be baptized she dreamt that she had been driven from her father's house and sent to wander in the bush. She saw herself as a lame person walking through a dense forest in eastern Nigeria where she encountered numerous snakes but had nothing to eat except berries and water. Then one day a light appeared and guided her to a clearing which abounded with her favourite foods. Her lameness disappeared, and while she was drinking water from a clear pool she saw an image of God, who told her to renounce all of her medicines and follow the rules of the True Church as strictly as possible. She was baptized on the following day, when she recounted the dream to the assembled congregation, which received it enthusiastically. David David is about twenty years old and is one of the three church members who is not an Igbo and who is a citizen of Cameroon. He attended a Roman Catholic school and was sponsored by a Catholic missionary who had befriended him. His mother has been insane since he was about two years old, and David moved to Tiko with her after a lot of trouble between himself and his father, who protested that he could not afford to pay for medicine for his wife. David brought his mother to the church shortly after arriving and she seemed to derive some pleasure and solace from participation in the service. He joined the church with his mother, and since then he has never been able to find a job. He spends most of his time at church services or working around the church. Shortly after joining the church, David had a dream which he claims to remember vividly. He dreamt that he was nailed to a tree by some very rough looking strangers and left to die. Eventually the nails fell out of the tree, and he was able to walk away. He 28</page><page sequence="10">DREAMS OF POWER walked into the nearest house where his mother was seated at a table reading the Bible. She had thrown away hundreds of medicine bottles and packets of herbal medicines, which were piled on the floor beside her. When David entered the room she spoke lucidly to him and described the joys of her religious experience. She then asked him to kneel and pray with her and, as they did so, the wounds on his hands and feet disappeared. These dreams are not particularly remarkable in their content; both dreams contain religious images, lameness, baptism, the Bible and praying. Unlike the dreams which have been described for other African Christian sects they do not follow a formula (Fabian 1966; 1971). The key to each of these dreams seems to lie in the personal history of the individual. We could analyse the contents from a psychological perspective by interpreting such elements as the snakes in Victoria's dreams, the clearing in the forest, or the crucifixion scene and the mother-son imagery reminiscent of Roman Catholic perceptions of the Virgin Mother. Such analyses might tell us a great deal about the psychic states of individual converts, but they would probably not add very much to our understanding of social processes within the church as a whole. Instead, the conversion dreams can be considered with respect to the uniqueness and centrality of the conversion experience in the lives of church members. Each church member sees conversion as a turning point and a re-awakening. There are a number of interesting metaphorical usages applied to conversion such as a burst of light, bright sunlight, a new-found youthfulness with physical vigour and the regaining of health, a sudden rush of relief from anxiety and worldly concerns, finding the correct path after being lost, or waking after a long, deep sleep. Another set of themes surrounding conversion deals with the idea of vulnerability prior to conversion as opposed to physical strength and resistance to temptation after the conversion. The instruction is designed to make the individual receptive to the messages and teachings, and the convert is told to expect a vision or dream. The conversion period requires that the convert be psychically receptive to new ideas and new experiences - a phenomenon which Holloman has described in writing of another social movement as a 'psychic opening' (Holloman 1974). The conversion dream is an experience which enables the convert to make sense out of the instruction, the healing and the myriad of new rules that the initiate faces, but, more importantly, it assures the initiate that she has come in contact with divinity. The conversion dream becomes a personal charter of the church member, and it is often used as a claim to full status in the congregation. All but four members of the church claimed to have experienced the conversion dream, and all those who had were glad to recount the dream. A church member's conversion experience is a topic of discussion which comes up in conversation or even in sermons. During the healing ceremonies and on other critical occasions people recount their conversion, and reference is usually made to the dream. The conversion dream is certainly not the only means by which membership is confirmed: full participation in the ceremonial life, monetary contributions, kindness towards other church members, enthusiastic singing and dancing and other forms of behaviour are expected of loyal church members, but all of these are considered meaningless if they do not spring from a strong inner commitment and communion with God. The conversion dream marks the beginning of this commitment, and it is probably the fact that it is the first integrating religious experience which the initiate has upon joining the church that 29</page><page sequence="11">DREAMS OF POWER accounts for the special place which church members accord to their dream. The conversion dreams are not only told during ceremonies, but they are also frequently cited or narrated in the course of conversions. Informants who are reticent to discuss many aspects of their private lives are usually quite willing to recount the conversion dream. Also people are aware of the conversion dreams of other church members and may refer to them either in reference to the individual and her commitment to the sect or to some aspect of the church's teachings. On one occasion, for example, an individual was discussing the healing power of prayer within the True Church of God and referred to a dream of one of the church members which depicted the cure of a sick infant. On another occasion the church's elder was describing the value of dancing and referred to a dream in which a person had undergone conversion while dancing. Not every member of the sect can recount the conversion dream of every other member, but each person seems to know four or five of the dreams, and the deacons and elders know many of them. The conversion dream is sometimes fitted into the church service, and a person's conversion dream is likely to be told when he or she is the object of prayers or of special concern. For example, one man was worried about sending his fifteen year old son away to a boarding school. The father was concerned that he would not be able to bear the expense of tuition, and he was fearful that the boy might come under the influence of others who would lead him away from the church. When he expressed his concern to three other men, one of them- a deacon of the church- reminded him of the dream which he had dreamt when he joined the church. He had seen himself clearing a dense forest with a very sharp cutlass. He was reminded that his faith was strong enough to cut away all obstacles, and presumably this strength should protect his son. Explanations of phenomena and guidelines for behaviour can be extracted from the conversion dreams, not only from one's own dream but from those of other church members as well. This can be done without relying on the special talents of a church leader to interpret the dream. Thus the conversion dreams are far less likely to be analysed and subject to exegetical scrutiny than other dreams. They are regarded as self-evident, mostly because they are heavily laced with religious images which suggest specific attributes of the relationship between the dreamer and the spiritual world. Another significant aspect of conversion dreams is that they are not surrounded by the competitiveness which characterizes the telling of other dreams. They help to describe each individual's conversion and entrance to the church, and the dream becomes a part of the public identity of that person. However, people do not try to best each other by comparing conversion dreams, nor do listeners engage in polemics in order to show that only they know the true meaning of the dream. It is certainly possible that individuals embellish their dreams to suit the occasion. Some individuals are noted for having had particularly significant or vivid dreams at the time of their entrance to the sect, but none of them was of particularly high status. Thus church members saw the dreams as a way of describing the intensity of their religious beliefs, but they did not use the dreams to confer a special status on themselves. The conversion dreams can be seen as an important part of the True Church of God's effort to foster a highly religious view of the world and promote a strict set of guidelines for behaviour. The religious images contained in the dreams served as a 30</page><page sequence="12">DREAMS OF POWER collective body of information for the church members. Because the conversion dreams were publicly known they were part of the common fund of knowledge of the church. The collective body of conversion dreams can be used in a way that is analogous to that in which the Bible is used: i.e. as a way of illustrating the power of God or the need to follow certain rules. For example, a point which is being discussed in a sermon can be clarified first by referring to a conversion dream and then by a quotation from the Bible. Since only half of the church members are literate, and many of those read with difficulty, the conversion dreams comprise a local folklore, a repository of striking images which help to establish religious truth. Because of the vivid imagery in the dreams they also provide the believers with an intimate knowledge of the supernatural. The knowledge supplements what the believer hears in sermons or reads.5 Since our purpose is to discuss the relationship between dreams and social processes within the True Church of God we must consider the place of conversion dreams in the social life of the sect. First of all, by demonstrating that church members have a direct religious experience when they join the sect, the conversion dreams confer legitimacy on the sect. The conversion dreams show that the sect consists of people who are indisputably in contact with the supernatural. The conversion dreams are also one of the main underpinnings of the belief that the members of the True Church of God are a select group of worshippers. The exclusiveness and the intolerance which characterizes the dealings which church members have with outsiders are built upon the feeling that the members are in direct communication with God. The conversion dreams, then, serve as a charter which helps to maintain a tightly knit, deeply religious community. There follows from this a second way in which the conversion dreams are related to the social organization of the church. Because people are not ranked on the basis of their conversion dreams, and because people do not use the dreams to compete with one another, the practice of recognizing conversion dreams stands as one of the few activities in which the sect is truly undifferentiated and eglitarian. Thus the conversion dreams help to establish the legitimacy of the church as a community of believers and further helps to promote a sense of communitas by recognizing the validity and intensity of each person's religious commitment. In these respects the conversion dreams contrast with the other type of dream which we will consider- the reconfirming dream. RECONFIRMING DREAMS Conversion dreams depict some incident surrounding a person's initial entrance into the sect, but people regularly have dreams which are perceived to be an indication of their relationship with the supernatural. We will refer to these as 'reconfirming dreams' because they reconfirm that the dreamer still has an active spiritual life and is a full-fledged member of the sect. Reconfirming dreams are narrated publicly as part of the church services when members sometimes narrate a recent dream to the assembled group. There is no time specifically designated for this purpose in the regular service, but there are a number of intervals during the Sunday service when it is acceptable for a person to stand up and recite a dream. The services which are held each evening also provide a setting for dream narration, probably because the early 31</page><page sequence="13">DREAMS OF POWER evening service is the most heavily attended of the daily services. Public dream narrations often occur by pre-arrangement with the preacher. The dreamer will first narrate the dream to the preacher, who will then encourage the person to tell the dream. I do not have any figures, but the evidence suggests that people are more likely to tell religious dreams to the pastor before presenting the public narration. Secular dreams, on the other hand, seem to be told more spontaneously, or at least without the prior knowledge of the preacher. I know of no case where a preacher forbade a person to tell a dream, but on several occasions the preacher would prompt the dreamer and actively encourage him to narrate his dream. The preacher was particularly interested in dreams which seemed to have some significance for the congregation as a whole rather than dreams whose message was strictly personal. The former offered him a broader topic for discussion and, in some cases, interpretation. For example, when I first began to attend the church several people had dreams dealing with the theme of my joining the church and proselytizing on its behalf in the United States. The preacher felt that these were significant enough to the membership at large that they should be narrated publicly. In other instances a church member would tell another member of a dream, and would encourage the dreamer to present it publicly. It is important to recognize that the narration of dreams during the church service sometimes occurs as the aftermath of a great deal of private discussion, including gossip and rumour, about significant recent dreams. The Sunday service, when dreams are most likely to be told, usually lasts for five hours. It begins at nine in the morning with hymns, which last for about an hour and a half. Men and women sit on separate sides of the church but leave their pews to dance together to the hymns, forming a procession in the form of a circle of perhaps thirty-five dancers. The duration of the music combined with a strongly pronounced rhythm played at a nearly deafening volume creates a state of excitation among the participants. In spite of the heightened emotional state during the dancing church members do not go into trances; nor do they have any institutionalized use of spirit possession. In fact the church exerts control over the states of consciousness of its members by not allowing them to enter into trance. On eight separate occasions I witnessed individuals who had reached particularly high states of excitation and who were then led away from the other dancers and made to sit down and regain composure. The preacher might slow the pace down somewhat during his presentation, which lasts about two hours. The final hour and a half consists of more music and dancing. The dream narration is presented in a relatively calm period in the service toward the end of the preacher's presentation. Occasionally the preacher sustains a very high emotional pitch throughout his sermon, but this is usually not the case. This means that the dream narrations occur at a time when the mood of the congregation is relatively reflective. Some examples of reconfirming dreams presented at Sunday services are now in order. One of the three deacons rises after the sermon and says that he has a dream which he would like to describe. He dreamt that he had been standing on the side of a mountainous road during a heavy rainstorm; he heard the sound of a motorcycle in the distance and soon saw the preacher driving towards him. But the road was muddy, and the preacher was having trouble controlling the motorcycle. As he rounded a curve the motorcycle went off the edge of the road and tumbled down the side of the mountain. A crowd of people gathered and searched for the preacher, but 32</page><page sequence="14">DREAMS OF POWER neither he nor his motorcycle could be found. The second dream was told by a young man who had been in the church for one year and had been displaying an exceptional degree of fervour. He told of a dream in which he and one of the deacons of the church were making a journey from Tiko to eastern Nigeria on one of the small commercial passenger boats which operates between the two countries. They travelled all night and had almost reached their destination when the outboard motor broke down and the boat began to drift out to sea. The crew was unsuccessful in repairing the motor and the passengers were becoming quite nervous. The young man and the deacon encouraged the passengers to pray and the deacon spent a long time praying quite intently. But the deacon's prayers did not succeed, for the motor would still not start. Then the young man saw Christ standing on the water and Christ told him to pray. Shortly after he began to pray the engine started and the boat reached port safely. The third example was told by a young woman who dreamed of going to visit her sister in a nearby town in Cameroon. The sister had a four-year-old child who was ill with a high fever. Various medicines were administered to the child and it was brought to the local hospital. When the child failed to respond to treatment the young woman was able to persuade her sister to bring the child to the True Church of God. The preacher held a special prayer meeting on behalf of the child and the dreamer recounted that she saw herself dancing all night and praying for the child. In the morning the child's fever had subsided and after a few days was well enough to return home. There are two common themes which are represented in these dreams. One is the personal power that comes through religious faith. This power is sufficient to heal the sick and to start faulty engines. The second theme is competition between individuals. The calamitous death of the preacher in the first dream and the inability of the deacon's prayers to start the engine in the second dream can both be interpreted as statements of the rivalry between men in the church concerning church offices. The themes of personal power through faith and competition among church members are related to one another because the ideal view of the church's organization is that the members are all equal. Yet the church requires an allocation of authority, and this is justified on the grounds that some people have a great degree of faith, better communication with God, and a greater proportion of God's power. Thus, faith, zeal and commitment are rewarded with certain statuses and titles within the church organization. We have chosen several examples which bear upon the argument that there is a relationship between the narration of reconfirming dreams and the ways in which people are ranked or regarded within the church. The examples are typical, but more needs to be said about the various sorts of dreams which are told during the church services. The seventy dream narrations which I recorded have been tabulated with respect to whether their contents are primarily religious or secular, and whether they were told by men or women (see Table 1). TABLE 1 religious secular total women 28 3 31 men 21 18 39 33</page><page sequence="15">DREAMS OF POWER The most obvious findings to be derived from Table 1 are that religious dreams outnumber secular dreams by more than two to one and that men tell a far greater proportion of secular dreams. There are, therefore, some important differences between the sexes with regard to the telling of dreams. The fact that men tell more dreams than women might merely be explained by the greater role which men play in church proceedings. But the imbalance between sacred and secular dreams in the two sex groups is not so easily explained. Men are no less given to talking of spiritual matters than women, and there is no evidence to suggest that the religious experiences of women are greater than those of men. If we categorize the dreams according to other criteria we begin to see the outline of an explanation (see Table 2). We categorized the dreams according to whether they gave accounts of a religious faith which was so great that it had the power to accomplish particular deeds such as curing illness. The second feature which we looked for was the element of competition between persons. TABLE 2 Men Women Total dreams in which faith is converted to action 16 7 23 dreams of competition between persons 23 5 30 Summarizing the results of Tables 1 and 2 we see that not only do men tell more dreams but that many of their dreams centre on the translation of faith into some sort of real power and that their dreams often have a competitive aspect. It is important to note, however, that the competition is often difficult to detect and can be quite subtle. For example, the dream which told of the preacher going over a cliff in a motorcycle accident was not tabulated as a dream which included the element of competition, even though it is quite likely that the dream is the manifestation of the envy with which the dreamer regards the preacher. We recorded no cases in which the dream narrative was used overtly to castigate church members by describing transgressions or sins (Charsley 1973). The absence of hostility in the competitive relationships described in these dreams is in keeping with the ideology of equality to which the church adheres. Its creed emphasizes a harmonious, truly Christian community, and it is unlikely that this ideal could be perpetuated or whether the relative harmony of the community could itself be maintained if open expressions of competition or accusation were tolerated. The competitiveness and rivalry between members can be softened when it is expressed in the form of a dream. The narrator or dreamer has no responsibility for what he dreams, and his rivals cannot blame him for professing anti-social sentiments. Thus a special sort of immunity is granted to the dreamer since the dream is not considered to be an expression of the dreamer's own sentiments but is a message which he or she has received and is passing along to others. Unfortunately our sample of dreams is not great enough to enable us to discern any clear patterns in the competitive dreams indicating rivalries between specific individuals. What is noticeable, however, is that when men narrate competitive dreams the other party in the dream is likely to be a male church member who holds 34</page><page sequence="16">DREAMS OF POWER an office or a title in the church. In one case two men narrated competitive dreams over a three-week period which concerned a third man who did not hold an office, but who had been openly coveting a special position which the preacher was about to confer on someone else. No community can attain the sort of egalitarian ideal which the True Church of God promotes. The church itself recognizes the problem by asserting that some people have more faith than others and are closer to God and that those persons should occupy positions of authority within the church. Thus there is a considerable amount of ambiguity as to the qualifications which a person should have in order to occupy a position of authority. Such objective criteria as the amount of education, the number of years one has been in the church, or the number of converts whom one has recruited are not used in any clear way to determine who should be appointed as a deacon or as a preacher. Such criteria enter into the consideration, but the church is not a rational bureaucracy in Weberian terms and, in order to foster the view that religious fervour is the single most valuable characteristic of an individual, religious fervour must be proclaimed as the criterion for advancement within church ranks. It is quite logical, therefore, that people should use dreams as expressions of their desire to gain recognition, for dreams are taken to be a mark of religious faith; they are blessings, and an unequivocal indication of a person's inner state. We might speculate on the relationship between dreams and the absence of trance experiences or belief in spirit possession in the True Church of God. Such phenomena are frequently taken in religious movements as valid statements of the commitment of members. In the True Church of God, the analysis of the sample of seventy dreams also revealed that there was a tendency on the part of men to narrate dreams in which their religious faith is so strong that it can be used to accomplish certain ends; in other words religious faith is an instrument of power. This theme is consonant with the official ideology of the church: authority is delegated to those with the strongest religious faith. One's commitment is the basis of authority and legitimizes the power which the preacher has over other members. In the organization of the church religious faith gives one power over church members; in dreams religious faith gives one the power to start engines and cure the sick. The latter sorts of power, as expressed in dreams, became metaphorical statements of the real power which church leaders have over members of the congregation. But, if the telling of dreams is related to an undercurrent of competitiveness among the men of the church, what of the dreams which women tell during church services? Like those of the men women's dreams are ostensibly reconfirmations of the faith of each believer and a statement that one's faith is still active. The most significant aspects of women's dreams were that they tended to be sacred and that they were less concerned with the translation of religious faith into action or competition among persons. The use of dream narration among women, then, appears to differ from men. This difference can be attributed to the fact that women are excluded from positions of authority in the church. There is a recognition that some women have greater faith than others and that dreams are an important indication of this faith. Thus the dream-ranking system used by women is one in which faith is valued for its own sake and not for the authority which it confers. Women's dreams stress faith and not the power which faith brings. 35</page><page sequence="17">DREAMS OF POWER CONCLUSION There are several ways in which dreams are used in the True Church of God. Conversion dreams are used as a validation of a person's religious faith and are retold and cherished by the individual as a part of his own personal charter. We have also suggested that the social usage of conversion dreams helps to promote the ideal of an egalitarian community of believers. But believers must periodically demonstrate that their faith is alive, and one of the ways this is done is through the public narration of reconfirming dreams. Men hold positions of authority in the church, and the actual criteria for attaining authority are not publicly stated and are quite ambiguous. Given the ideals of an undifferentiated membership and the ambiguity concerning leadership, every active male in the church is a potential leader. The social organization of the church is one in which there is very little room at the top and this sets in motion a considerable amount of tension among men and a contest for recognition. The dream is an attempt to gain recognition in addition to being a reconfirmation of faith. We might suggest that the relationship between the ability to narrate a dream and the ability to lead a religious congregation effectively may not be merely accidental. The preacher and, to a lesser extent, the deacons and others who hold offices are responsible for keeping the faith of others alive through their words. Verbal fluency and the ability to derive meaning from experience are cognitive skills that are widely sought in religious leaders (Schweder, 1972: 407-12). The qualities which are exhibited when a member of the church publicly narrates his dream are the same sort of cognitive skills which go to make up a religious leader. Some narrators are more effective than others in drawing attention to their narrations and in presenting dreams which seem to be pregnant with meaning. Dream narrations are performances, just as preaching and the behaviour associated with other leadership roles are largely performances. Thus dream narration may be a valid means of differentiating between individuals and identifying those who have the requisite cognitive skills for assuming positions of authority in such a religious sect. NOTES At several stages in the preparation of this essay I have discussed the material with colleagues. I wish to acknowledge the assistance of Benjamin S. Orlove, James Peoples and Miriam Wells, none of whom are responsible for any errors of fact or interpretation which might lie herein. 2 The study of this sect was conducted in Cameroon in 1975. I am grateful to the Research Committee of the University of California, Davis, for a grant which made the research possible. 3 This quality of unity is evident in the high degree of conformity to be seen in the behaviour of church members. The conformity and consistency in behaviour is all the more remarkable when one considers the absence of a coherent, integrated set of beliefs. In other words consistency and order are to be found in behaviour and it seems to matter little that the belief system of the sect is quite disorderly. 4 This is not to say that the dreams which church members might relate to one or two other people in the course of a conversation have no relationship to the social organization of the sect. We can assume that such narrations are a significant form of social interaction. Our data on such conversations are limited, however, and introducing these data into the study would present a separate set of issues. 5 It is interesting to consider the importance of dreams in the True Church of God in relationship to the somewhat impoverished display of symbols in the ceremonial life of the sect. It would indeed be possible to argue that the dreams provide the sect with a sort of knowledge which might be obtained, or created, in other religious traditions by means of symbols. 36</page><page sequence="18">DREAMS OF POWER REFERENCES Berglund, A. 1975.

Les membres de l'Eglise se considerent comme une communaute de croyants, unis par un ensemble commun de croyances, et s'efforcent de r6aliser une fraternite egalitaire, en s'aidant materiellement les uns les autres et en priant pour la sante de chacun. Cet essai decrit la maniere dont les reves sont interpretes par les membres de la Veritable Eglise de Dieu et explique comment les reves figurent dans l'organisation sociale de la secte. Nous ne sommes pas primordialement interesses par le contenu des reves. Plut6t, nous nous concentrons sur l'acte de narration du reve et examinons de quelle faqon les membres de l'Eglise utilisent les reves pour demontrer la profondeur de leur engagement religieux et pour acqu6rir un certain prestige a l'interieur d'une communaute censee etre egalitaire. Vu que le reve est pr6sum&amp; mettre l'individu en contact avec le monde spirituel, la narration est consideree comme un enonce veridique sur l'etat spirituel de l'individu. Le reve est un signe de foi, et un reve particulierement vivide ou dramatique rehaussera le statut du reveur a l'interieur de la communaut6. Ainsi, les narrations de reves introduisent ils une notion de concurrence et d'in6galit6 dans la communaut6 des croyants. Lorsqu'une personne devient membre de l'Eglise elle a typiquement une vision religieuse qui lui vient sous forme de reve. Ces 'reves-conversions' aident A etablir l'identit6 de la personne a l'interieur de l'Eglise. Apres etre devenu membre de la secte, les personnes peuvent avoir d'autres reves, que nous avons appeles 'reves de reconfirmation' parce qu'ils reconfirment que le reveur a toujours une vie spirituelle active. Nous examinons les differences entre les reves avec un contenu ouvertement religieux et ceux qui sont essentiellement s6culiers, et nous consid6rons les differences de narrations de reves et chez les hommes et chez les femmes. L'6elment competitif est plus accentue chez les hommes et g rapport a la competition pour l'obtention de positions cles d'autorite a l'interieur de l'Eglise. Finalement, nous suggerons que le succes de narration d'un reve est fond6 sur une habilite mentale et verbale, et que la personne qui peut impressionner les autres avec l'importance de ses reves a de fortes chances d'etre un chef prestigieux de l'Eglise. 38</page></plain_text>
