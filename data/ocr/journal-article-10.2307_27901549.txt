<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE* Introduction In presenting this paper for the Festschrift in honor of my long time friend, Charles Hartshorne, I should state at once that I am writing as a biologist, specifically a geneticist, interested in the philosophical implications of his subject, but with only a superficial knowledge of philosophy in general. My justification for writing on this topic is the belief that the philosophy of science is neces sarily a joint venture since it is obvious that advances in science provide data on the nature of existence which must be taken into account in philosophical consideration of this subject. This is most obvious in connection with the drastic revision of the basic concepts of physics since 1900, the impact of which on philosophy has recently been brilliantly developed by Capek. There have also been great advances in biology. The resulting concepts do not strike at the very categories of thought and defy expression in language (other than mathematics) as do those of modern physics. Never theless they have a special importance from the facts that the only direct knowledge of mind that any one possesses is associated with a certain living organism, himself, and that in general, indications of the presence of mind are restricted to living organisms. The fact that while such indications are universally accepted in the case of other human beings but become progressively less convincing as we pass to animals closely similar to man, and from these to such forms as fishes, insects, clams, worms and protozoa, raises difficulties. Few see any indication of mind in plants. The Subdivisions of Biology There are many ways of subdividing the field of biology.

Tables I and II give a two dimensional classification: by level of organization and by similar problems that arise at some or all of the levels. These include (A) that of describing the persistent entities and (B) of accounting for their persistence; (C) of de scribing and (D) accounting for the orderly processes by which most biological entities develop from relative simplicity to com plexity in their patterns, and (E) of describing and interpreting the processes by which the entities at some of the levels multiply. All of these involve the working out of the relations between levels. Genetics plays an especially important role in this respect and aspects of it are indicated in italics. Biology began in the middle with interest in the external appearance of the larger forms, their behaviors, their life histories, and their modes of reproduction. From this it proceeded toward understanding of their structures in terms of organs (anatomy) and tissues (histology), of the functioning of these in the main tenance of life (gross physiology), and in the description and mechanism of the usually very complex process by which a fer tilized egg becomes an adult (embryology). Reproduction some times occurs by budding but is usually from union of eggs pro duced by females and sperms by males. In the course of study of fine scale structure, it became apparent about a century and a half ago, that the larger organisms, whether animals or plants, are composed of microscopic units that are essen tially similar in all of them, and also similar to certain whole orga nisms of minute size (protozoa, protophyta). It came to be recog nized that these cells, each a jellylike droplet, bounded by a mem brane, containing numerous internal granules and membranes, and especially a large complex organ, the nucleus, are in a real sense, complete organisms. Each originates only by fission of a preexistent cell, and carries on its life processes, largely by and for itself. The validity of this view-point has been borne out by the long con tinued cultivation of cells in media as if protozoa. There is a flourishing branch of human genetics, devoted to the heredity of biochemical and other differences among human cells, multiplying</page><page sequence="5">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 269 in petri dishes. The cell has thus become an important object of study on its own account. The concept that organisms are composed of suborganisms has become one of the most significant principles of biology. For many years, however, it seemed that the cell was the ultimate unit of living matter. It is now known that the characteristics of cells and, through them, of multicellular organisms depend largely on a vast number of entities known as genes that are autonomous in struc ture, but carried in linear strands (chromosomes) in the nuclei of cells. Although believed to be essentially molecular in pattern of organization, genes have the most fundamental property of living organisms. Each duplicates its own specificity, irrespective of as sociated genes or of environmental conditions, along the succession of cells through which it is transmitted. They thus constitute the material basis of heredity. If by chance (perhaps once in a million generations for each gene) one does undergo change (a mutation), it duplicates thereafter as of the new sort. Each gene thus has an evolutionary history of its own. There are cogent reasons for thinking that the structure of a gene is that of a giant molecule of the category known as deoxyri bonucleic acid (DNA), a polymer in which each of the thousands of units (nucleotides) consists of a nitrogen base (purine or pyri midine), a 5-carbon sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphoric acid. The x-ray diffraction pattern of DNA according to Watson and Crick (1953) indicates a double helix in which each strand has ten or eleven nucleotides per gyre with pentose phosphate backbone on the outside and connection with the other strand by means of a pyrimidine in one linked by hydrogen bonds with a particular purine in the other (cytosine with guanine, thymine with adenine). The basis for specificity is the order of succession of the four kinds of nucleotides in either strand, that in the other being necessarily exactly complementary. It is supposed that under certain cell con ditions, there is uncoiling and separation of the strands followed (or accompanied) by recoiling separately, and synthesis by each of its exact complement from free nucleotides and thus duplication of the double helix. The multiplication of specific DNA, extracted from cells, has been carried out in cellfree solutions in the test tube by Kornberg and associates.</page><page sequence="6">270 THE MONIST Under certain circumstances in the cell, DNA molecules also synthesize ribonucleic acid (RNA) in which uracil takes the place of thymine and ribose of deoxyribose. These determine the syn thesis of correspondingly specific kinds of protein molecules (specif ic sequences involving about twenty kinds of amino acids) in a way that is in active process of analysis by biochemists. Proteins are the major constituent of living matter apart from water (which constitutes about two thirds). Certain proteins, the enzymes, be have as catalysts that guide the specific course of metabolism in each cell and thus ultimately determine all of the characteristics of organisms, except as these are modified by environmental effects. Because of the indirectness of the relation between gene and char acter, each gene tends to affect many characters and each character is affected by many genes. It is to be noted that the molecule which is the physical basis of heredity (DNA) is composed wholly of a few common kinds of atoms (C,H,0,N,P,) as is also true of the proteins (C,H,0,N,S,). A few other kinds of atoms play important roles in the prosthetic groups of enzymes, in such processes as photosynthesis and oxygen transport, in regulating the body fluids and in the composition of relatively inert structures such as bone and shell. All of these atoms are continually being exchanged with the environment in the course of metabolism. There is no kind of elementary substance that is peculiar to living matter. The persistence of a living entity is thus that of pattern, not of a particular assemblage, of material units. According to the famous dictum of the great comparative anatomist and paleontologist Baron Cuvier, nearly a century and a half ago: La vie est donc un tourbillon, plus ou moins rapide, plus ou moins compliqu dont la direction est constante et qui entr ne toujours des mol cules de m mes sortes, mais o les mol cules individuelles entrent et d'o elles sortent continuellement, de mani re que la forme du corps vivant lui est plus essentielle que sa mati re. It may be noted that in the structural hierarchy, gene, cell, large organism, the relation of gene to cell is utterly different from that of cell to large organism. In the latter case, one initial cell multiplies and by differentiation of its descendants gives rise to the large organism. On the other hand, two full sets of genes are</page><page sequence="7">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 271 assembled in the initial cell, one from the egg itself and one from the fertilizing sperm, and these two sets are in general, passed on to all of the cell descendants by duplication and segregation of duplicants at each cell division. There is one exception, the reduc tion to a single set in the formation of the germ cells by means of a unique sort of a cell division in which there is a pairing of maternal and paternal representatives of each kind of chromosome in place of a duplication. Exchanges occur between these paired chromo somes followed by random assortment and thus the production of a novel set of genes. The hierarchic pattern of life is extended in the other direction by the existence of colonial organisms, resulting from the failure of complete separation of individuals after fission or budding. In some cases there is differentiation and division of labor among the zooids, and even, in certain bryozoa, development of a common nervous system by which the colony can react as an essentially single organism. It is probable that such complex segmental organisms as annelid worms and ultimately arthropods (such as lobsters, spiders and insects) trace to this process in their evolution. Even when there is complete separation of individuals after re production, the group of relatives tend to form a population within which there is continued interbreeding. There are probably always many alternative forms of each basic gene (alleles), mostly with very slight differential effects, that arise by mutation and accumu late in the population. The recombination of these gives the poten tiality for a vastly greater number of hereditary types in a popula tion than there are protons and electrons in the visible universe. Thus it is reasonably certain that no two sexually produced in dividuals have exactly the same constitution. Nevertheless the group maintains its statistical characteristics generation after generation. It may be looked upon as a loosely knit organism with protoplasmic continuity of a netlike pattern in space-time. This important unit has been called the deme. Such units of population are usually connected with many others by more or less frequent crossbreeding. The entire network, which may be continental in its range, or even worldwide as with man, is the very important unit; the species. There is still proto plasmic continuity but portions may be separated by thousands of generations.</page><page sequence="8">272 THE MONIST As with individual organisms, this entity has a complicated history, its evolution. Some forms (e.g. certain brachiopods) have hardly changed for hundreds of millions of years. Many have gradually achieved considerable changes along a single line or perhaps a number of branching lines. In other cases, the process of change has been explosively rapid in terms of geologic time and has led, by branching, to types that differ enormously (as in the case of the orders of mammals in the paleocene). The essential condition at any time seems to have been ecologic opportunity. This is presented to the first forms that reach unoccupied terri tory, also to the few forms that survive a catastrophic change of conditions, but especially to a form that in the course of gradual perfection of adaptation to a very special way of life has acquired a character or cluster of characters that happens to give a general advantage and thus the possibility for branches that can specialize along many different lines. The evolution by certain marsh dwelling fishes of feet from fins as a means of crawling from one drying pool to another was one of the adaptations that opened up the dry land for exploitation. The great class of birds no doubt arose from the evolution of the wing from a reptile leg. The most successful forms (including man) have had a zigzag rather than a direct evolutionary history, because of a succession of such breakthroughs. As to the mechanism of evolution, the simplest view is that on which each mutation may be considered either as unequivocally favorable, or as unequivocally unfavorable in relation to the pre vailing type. In the former case, the mutation gradually replaces the old type gene. Favorable mutations must, however, be ex ceedingly rare unless the adaptiveness of the old type has been reduced because of change in the environmental conditions, in which case this process may bring about rapid readaptation. In general, relative selective values can properly be assigned only to genetic systems as wholes, since individual mutations that are favorable in some combinations are almost certain to be un favorable in others. Evolution depends on the fitting together of a harmonious system of gene effects. There may be a vast number of different, more or less harmonious systems. Natural selection tends to hold the population to one, not in general the best one, that is possible from available genes. For an effective evolutionary process there must be a shifting balance between local random changes in</page><page sequence="9">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 273 gene frequencies and the local pressures of selection, and also a balance between local inbreeding and crossbreeding, that permits the continual selection among demes through differential popula tion growth and migration. The most effective process either of perfecting an adaptation along a particular line, or of exploiting a major ecological opportunity is thus not, in the long run, the almost deterministic pressure of mass selection acting on recurrent mutations, but rather one of continuous trial and error, made possible by labile balance among all of the factors (Wright 1931, 48, 55, 59). Branching of evolutionary lines comes about through relatively complete isolation of subpopulations by one means or another. The evolutionary process results in categories higher than the species: genus, family, order, class, phylum and kingdom. In these there is no continuity, apart from rare hybridization, except that in the remote past. They are not natural entities in the same sense as the deme and species but merely conveniences of classifica tion. In most animals, the deme is integrated not only by biparental reproduction but also by social relations. In some cases, this has led to a tightly knit organization almost comparable to that of a multi cellular individual. The most extreme examples, apart from man, are found in the social insects such as ants (Wheeler, 1911), bees (von Frisch, 1950), and termites (Emerson, 1939). In man, the capacity for symbolic speech, has made possible a still more far-reaching type of social organization (Gerard 1940), and a new sort of evolutionary process, that of ideas, enormously more rapid than biological evolution. The result is a multiplicity of social organisms, cutting across each other so that the same individual may belong to many different ones (state, church, profession, etc.). This is analogous to the intersection of organ and tissue as suborganisms at the level of the individual. There is also a hierarchic pattern: city, state, nation, now perhaps working pain fully toward some sort of orderly integration of all mankind. The representatives of the various species inhabiting each neigh borhood form an ecologic system, Darwin's "web of life," which maintains its statistical properties year after year because of various limiting factors and self-regulatory interactions between predator and prey, and between parasite and host. After a catastrophic</page><page sequence="10">274 THE MONIST disturbance, there tends to be a developmental process in the form of an orderly ecologic succession, leading to whatever is the climax type of community under the prevailing conditions. The ecologic systems of adjacent regions are connected. In the end, all life on the surface of the earth and in its waters may be considered one vast symplasm (Wheeler) of which the anatomy is described in biogeography and the evolution in paleontology. A third dimension could be given to the scheme of classification by assigning a branch of pathology to each category for considera tion of changes beyond the limits of adaptive capacity (Link, 1932). Genetics began with the deduction from the results of breeding experiments of certain formal principles that accounted for the differences observed among organisms related by descent. Formal genetics (1) may be considered to be an aspect of the physiology of reproduction, at the level of the individual. Because of the central position of the mechanism of long-time persistence of type in biologic theory, genetics has ramified into nearly all levels of the biological hierarchy. This began when breeding experiments re vealed the existence of a new intracellular unit, the gene. It became a descriptive technique, that in some respects revealed more of the ultrastructure of the cell than the highest power of the microscope. The most remarkable thing, however, has been the detailed agreement in the conclusions from these very different techniques. The joint field is known as cytogenetics (2). Genetics has also joined forces with biochemistry in developing the chemical theory of the gene (3) and in a penetrating analysis of the meta bolic processes of the cell, the subject of physiological genetics (4). Joint genetic and histologie studies have contributed much to the analysis of development (5). The genetics of behavior (6) brings us back to the level of the individual. All of the foregoing give a basis for the statistical genetics of populations (7) which in con junction with studies of experimental and natural populations (Dobzhansky 1951) has brought about a more adequate under standing of organic evolution, along lines already touched on. Genetics more than anything else, binds the biology of all levels into a unity.</page><page sequence="11">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 275 Biologic and Physical Entities The hierarchy of biological entities may be looked upon as a continuation of the physicist's hierarchy: Planck's unit of action, photon and elementary particle, atom, molecule. The biological hierarchy from gene and other macromolecules to world biota is, however, to the side of the main physical hierarchy which proceeds from molecule through systems with only point to point integration (crystals and geological formations, or bodies of water) to earth and solar system, or directly from atoms to stars on the way to galaxy and the universe as a whole, as the all embracing organism. Intricacy of organization seems, however, to culminate in the multicellular individual in the middle of the biological hierarchy. The behavior of such individuals seems to transcend physico chemical interpretation and the phenomena of consciousness in ourselves, as representative of such individuals, seems utterly in explicable on this basis. The Dualism of Mind and Matter The physicist can accept a common sense dualism of mind and matter (or better of mental and physical action) without too much difficulty in his scientific work. This is also true of the social scientist and humanist in their fields. The biologist, bridging both worlds in an apparent unity, is continually in trouble. The philo sophical biologist cannot escape from the problem of the relation of mind and matter. It will be convenient here to list a number of possible relations. At one extreme is solipsism. This, I suppose, is the viewpoint of a new born baby for whom all reality is encompassed in a single stream of consciousness: a kaleidoscopic medley of pressures, tem peratures, colors, sounds, smells, etc. There is no way indeed, as Berkeley and Hume brought out, by which any of us can give a rigorous demonstration that anything else exists, but most of us became aware very early of constellations of sensations that per sisted with such regularity, whether we wished it or not, as to give an overwhelming impression of external reality. Adults who relapse into a private world in which no distinction is made between fantasy and external reality must be shut up in institutions.</page><page sequence="12">276 THE MONIST Anthropologists tell us that primitive man had a viewpoint to ward nature, known as animism. In its most primitive form, all things were assumed to be of the same general sort as ourselves, merely more or less powerful. This was extreme anthropomorphism and application took the form of magic. The capacity for spontaneous activity left the savage temporarily in sleep and was observed to leave others permanently in death. Animism tended to pass into a form in which mind and matter were considered to be separable. The dryads could come out of the trees, and the naiads out of the lakes. There was a beginning of the ultimately sharp distinction between two kinds of existence, each of which it was thought might occur alone as disembodied mind, or mindless matter but at least in man, in an association of body and soul. The progress in the recognition of regularities in the world (natural science), has led to a continual decline in the role assigned mind and increase in that assigned matter, using the term to include all aspects of the physical world. Animism gave way to polytheism and this to increasingly impersonal monotheism and often, in science at least, to almost pure materialism. There are several viewpoints which scientists have taken. There are still those who accept the intervention of disembodied spirits in the ordinary affairs of life. In relatively recent years this included such distinguished scientists as Sir Oliver Lodge and A. R. Wallace. The regularity with which apparently incontrovertible evidence has later been shown to rest on self deception or clever fraud has led most persons to profound skepticism with respect to disem bodied spirits at this level, whatever may be their beliefs in religion. The second viewpoint, vitalistic dualism which accepts mind less nonliving matter, and living matter, sometimes at least asso ciated with mind, but does not accept disembodied mind (except perhaps for the Creator) has had wide acceptance among scientists. Descartes expressed clearly the underlying philosophy under which modern science has developed in his recognition of two sharply distinct modes of existence-matter, characterized primarily by ex tension in space, and mind as stated in his proposition "cogito ergo sum." Descartes restricted mind to man in the natural world. He held that animals were merely automata which along with plants and inanimate objects were subject to rigorous physical laws of</page><page sequence="13">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 277 cause and effect. He held, to be sure, that both extension and mind were created by God but in relation to science his viewpoint clearly belongs in this second category. It is a philosophy that has served admirably for more than three centuries in the development of physical science in harmony for the most part with humanism and theology. Many biologists, especially those studying whole animals have postulated mind in animals other than man and have treated mind as an active factor in their science, not merely in the scientists. They have found no sharp break in mode of behavior between man and higher animals and none between these and lower animals down to protozoa. Moreover they find no break in behavior between proto zoa and the cells of which higher animals and plants are composed. Among leading modern biologists who have felt the necessity of postulating a vital principle not derivable from physics or chemis try are Driesch, Jennings (1953), Ralph Lillie (1945), and Sinnott (1955). Bergson (1911) has given appealing philosophical support for an "elan vital." The prevailing trend among biologists, however, has been away from vitalism and toward increasing materialism and mechanism in interpreting physiology and behavior, and toward a decreasing role of the supernatural with respect to origins. Linnaeus accounted for the multiplicity of kinds of organisms by separate creation. Lamarck by advocating evolution, pushed creation back to the origin of life. His explanation of evolution was vitalistic as it involved an innate perfecting principle in life, diverted into branching lines by hereditary effects of the desires and actions of animals. Darwin gave a great impetus toward a wholly deter ministic science (our third category) by accounting for evolution by random variation and selection. Jacques Loeb was the leader at the beginning of this century in insisting on the rigorous exclusion of any but physico-chemical explanations in biology. The limit of this trend would seem to be complete materialism, the complete denial of mind as a category of existence. This how ever is contrary to the obvious facts of immediate experience. Our stream of consciousness is all that is experienced directly. Mind, even though denied any role in the course of events, must be retained as a category of existence, at least as an observer. If the non-living world is completely devoid of mind, and if, as</page><page sequence="14">278 THE MONIST it seems necessary to believe, there was a time when no life could exist, how did mind appear? Lloyd Morgan (1933) (cf. Wright, 1935) treated the emergence of mind as a phenomenon of the same sort as the emergence of a new organ or physiological capacity, in evolution. A new organ, however, involves nothing more mys terious than differential growth, leading for example to an out pocketing from a flat surface, that turns out to be useful and may be elaborated by further differential growth. Similarly, loss, addi tion or rearrangement in the pattern of a macromolecule may enable it to bind certain other molecules in such a way as to catalyze a new metabolic process. Emergence of either of these sorts, however surprising its conse quences, offers no serious philosophical difficulty. Emergence of mind from no mind at all is sheer magic. Its postulation is as pathetically inadequate as the doctrine of Anaxagoras that mind depends on certain atoms that differ from others merely in being finer, smoother and more mobile. The emergence of mind in the course of individual development presents a less extreme dilemma for dualism but nevertheless a serious one and one that is an everyday occurrence instead of a single event in the remote past. The fertilized egg, while a living cell, behaves in a way that suggests a purely physico-chemical interpretation rather than one involving mind. If the human mind is not to appear by magic, it must be a development from the mind of the egg and back of this, apparently, of the DNA molecules of the egg and sperm nuclei that constitute its heredity. Panpsychism The only satisfactory solution of these dilemmas would seem to be that mind is universal, present not only in all organisms and in their cells but in molecules, atoms and elementary particles. This is more plausible for the entities of modern physics than for the con cept of matter that held essentially from Democritus to the end of the last century. The ultimate atoms, constant in number, stripped of all secondary qualities (color, smell, etc.) were conceived of as particles each of which filled impenetrably a certain portion of otherwise empty space but which were capable of change of posi tion in space on due cause and of transferring motion to other</page><page sequence="15">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 279 atoms in such a way that the total amount of motion remained in some sense unchanged. The dominant philosophy of science before 1900 is admirably expressed in the famous dictum of Laplace. An intellect which at a given instant knew all the forces acting in nature and the positions of all things of which this world consists supposing the said intellect were vast enough to subject these data to analysis-would embrace in the same formula the motions of the greatest bodies in the universe and those of the slightest atoms, noth ing would be uncertain for it and the future like the past would be present to its eyes. The concept of events as occurring in a universal isotropic, three dimensional space, which persists unchanged by these events, and is thus independent of time has been replaced under Einstein's theory of relativity by the concept of existence as consisting of multiple causal chains of events, the spatial and temporal relations of which may differ for different observes (except at intersections) in such a way as to preclude any general meaning to simultaneity. Matter and kinetic energy have become entities of the same general sort, interchangeable in ways that now threaten the continued existence of mankind. The wavelike properties of material units (protons, electrons) as well as of radiant energy (photons) indicate that the ultimate physical reality consists of events in which oscillatory change (in themselves, as singularities in space-time) is of the es sence. It has been shown that there is irreducible experimental in determinism in the succession of events at the level of Planck's unit of action. While interpretation of Heisenberg's indeterminacy prin ciple differs among physicists the simplest interpretation is that it implies emergence of genuine novelty at each instant, but novelty that is in statistical continuity with the past (above the level of Planck's unit). Under this view there can be no real vision of the future whether by the second sight of Highland seers or by ex trasensory perception, but merely tentative extrapolation from past trends. Existence is a real adventure, not a mere unfolding before our eyes of a "future" that really exists now and always has existed. We must go back to animism for a fresh start toward a fourth viewpoint. The earliest Greek philosophers, the hylozoic school, held that all that exists is alive, but in a less crudely anthropomor phic sense than primitive animism. This concept was further re</page><page sequence="16">280 THE MONIST fined by Aristotle who seems to have been the only major philos opher who was also a major figure in biology. He was undoubtedly foremost in the ancient world as anatomist, embryologist and clas sifier of the animal kingdom. His concept of epig nesis (the step by step elaboration of the complexity of an adult organism from its simple beginnings) was based on observations of developing em bryos. It was a great advance over the crude doctrine of preforma tion of Hippocrates (although the latter may be considered a remote precursor of the gene theory at a higher cycle in the advance of knowledge). In his general concept of the development of phenomena as occurring through the association of a purposeful essence (form) with an inert substrate (matter) we recognize a biologist's philos ophy in contrast, for example, with the more purely idealistic teachings of his master, Plato. With respect to man, his concept of the relation of mind to matter seems close to that of modern Vitalis tic dualism. His acceptance of contingency in the develop ment of phenomena is in line with the indeterminacy of modern physics though it must be recognized that the detailed viewpoint of modern physics could hardly have been attained except on the foundation laid by a rigorous determinism more akin to the philos ophy of Democritus than to that of Aristotle, whose physical con cepts were in detail wholly erroneous. Turning to relatively modern times we find the doctrine of universal association of mind and matter in the philosophy of Spinoza. This association was a necessary consequence of his iden tification of God and the universe and his specification of exten sion and thought as two of the attributes of God. Spinoza was more concerned with religion and ethics than with science, and his views did not seem to constitute as useful a philosophy of science as did those of Descartes. The dualistic panpsychism involved in the universal association of mind and matter is not quite the same as what may be considered a fifth viewpoint, that of dual-aspect or monistic panpsychism, of which the first clear account that I have read was that by W. K. Clifford (1879) who however refers to an earlier statement by Wundt and doubtfully to a "suggestion thrown out by Kant that his Ding an sich might be of the nature of mind." As this view point has long seemed to me to provide the most tenable philos</page><page sequence="17">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 281 ophy of science it may be desirable to give my own approach to it. (Wright, 1921, 31, 35, 41, 48, 53.) As a student of science, I began with an acceptance of a determinism as rigorous as that of La place's dictum, although disturbed by the absence of any place in this scheme for the fact of consciousness. This mechanistic view point was first somewhat shaken by reading (in 1912) Bergson's "Creative Evolution" which presented a viewpoint that seemed more satisfactory as a philosophy of Biology. I found, however, that I was unable to accept it as a philosophy of science as a whole. Similarly I looked with sympathy on Jenning's position in his famous controversy with Jacques Loeb on the interpretation of animal behavior: trial and error vs. tropism, but felt that the over tones of vitalism in his position were unsatisfactory. I began to see the possibility of a different approach on reading "The Origin and Nature of Life" by the biochemist Benjamin Moore (1912) who suggested that cells and higher organisms and societies might be looked upon as extensions of the series atom, molecule, colloid (p. 189), but the dilemma: absolutely deterministic laws of physics at one end of the scale, consciousness and apparent freedom at the other, remained. The key to a unified philosophy seemed to be provided by "The Grammar of Science" by Karl Pearson (1899), the leader of the statistical or biometric school of biology which I read a couple of years later. After emphasizing the subjective nature of all of our knowledge of the external world, he pointed out that the laws of nature could be looked upon, not as part of the eternal structure of the world, but as merely condensed statisti cal descriptions of how things are observed to behave. There need be no essential difference from statistical laws of voluntary human behavior such as the law of supply and demand. If mind and matter are coexistensive, they may be looked upon as two aspects of the same reality. They do not, however, stand on an equal footing. All that any of us can know directly is our own experience, mind, including our raw sensations, our perceptions, memories, emotions, thoughts and volitions. Matter (or physical action), is always a deduction from regularities that we find in our experience. In general, mind may be considered the inner aspect of the reality of the observer, matter the external aspect of a reality in the inner aspect of which the observer does not partake, except in so far as perception implies interaction.</page><page sequence="18">282 THE MONIST Figure 1. Diagrammatic representation of interaction within and between two complex minds which lead each to interpret the other as matter. Field of Mind Purpose Emotion Memory ( A as matter) Perception Action Sensation Sensation Action Perception (B as matter) Memory Emotion Purpose This point of view is represented in figure 1. A and B represent two minds, largely private, but capable nevertheless of interacting either directly or through a chain. A perceives certain regularities in its stream of consciousness which it ascribes to an external reality, B, but as it does not enter into B's stream of consciousness, it tends to consider B as merely an unconscious source of dis turbance, matter. B similarly deduces matter, A, from the regulari ties induced by the interaction in its stream of consciousness. As each becomes aware of many external realities with varying interrelations, it locates them in a coordinate system of its own, consisting of two dimensions of direction in addition to one of remoteness and one of order of succession (time). In certain cases complex minds recognize the behavior of exter nal matter as paralleling their own inner reality so completely as to compel identification as their own bodies. In other cases, the be havior is so similar in kind, though not parallel, as to indicate mat ter inhabited by an alien mind, other men or higher organisms. In other cases there seems no indication of mind. One of the clearest statements of this viewpoint that I later en countered was that of the psychologist Troland (1922) who traced it back to Fechner in the nineteenth century. I was also led to Clifford's statement to which I have referred.</page><page sequence="19">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 283 It must be admitted that in discussions through the years I have found few biologists who seem at all attracted to this view. It was accordingly very gratifying to find far reaching agreement with Charles Hartshorne (1942, 1954) who had arrived at a similar view by a wholly different route. In Whitehead's "Science and the Modern World" (1925) to which I was now led, I found the most complete philosophical development of this point of view although I cannot say that I can penetrate into the full depth of his meaning. As a working philosophy of science, dual-aspect panpsychism leads to two points of view. First is the psychical interpretation of the inner aspect of reality which the Australian zoologist Agar (1951) has attempted to apply. Second is the statistical description of the external aspect, in which Karl Pearson was long the leader. Statistical mechanics may be considered as the application in phys ical science (Margenau, 1952). The psychical interpretation tends to be closely allied in modes of attack on problems to vitalism, and statistical description to determinism, but with a wholly different metaphysics in each case. The logical relation between psychical interpretation and statistical description is that of alternative points of view with respect to the same thing, while vitalism, determinism and either dualistic or dual-aspect panpsychism are mutually exclusive theories. The two modes of interpretation under dual-aspect panpsy chism cannot be combined in the same explanation. One cannot account for the behavior of an amoeba as due partly to physico chemical factors and partly to what it wants to do without danger of duplication if the two modes are merely aspects of the same thing: as it appears to an outsider and as we imagine it appears to the amoeba itself. The Hierarchy of Mind Because of the hierarchic nature of biologic and physical entities it appears that my mind must be based somehow on the minds of my cells and these on those of their constituent molecules and so on down to elementary particles. As atoms are continually entering and continually departing, the mind of the whole must depend on patterns of interaction in this whole rather than on the particular atoms. As noted, mind is</page><page sequence="20">284 THE MONIST really the inner aspect of actions rather than of things except as the latter are interpreted as bundles of actions. It is obvious that the mind of an individual is not merely the sum of those of the cells. In one sense it is something much more, an integration or bundle of interactions, but in another, much less. I am not conscious of what all my cells are doing. My focus of consciousness shifts continually, now on a perception, now on a memory which has somehow been stored out of my mind, now on an emotional state, now on the construction of an abstract pattern of thought, now on the process of arriving at a decision or on the demands of action. I must suppose that the interactions within different, but overlapping cell groups of my brain somehow create a single, complex but continually shifting stream of consciousness, which, however, may be wholly interrupted in dreamless sleep, while those of the components continue. When we pass from the individual to society as an organism, we at once perceive a serious difficulty. On the dual-aspect hypothesis, the interaction of individuals should constitute a mind, a stream of consciousness, at a higher level. We speak of the spirit of America, highly integrated at times, at others, sadly disintegrated by mutual suspicion. We think of this, however, only as a figure of speech, inconceivable as a reality comparable to our own stream of con sciousness. The very fact of interaction, at any level, implies however that minds are not entirely private. The entities cannot be the window less monads of Leibniz. They exist as components of a more com prehensive mind in a pattern of relations to each other, which each represents to itself as a pattern in space and time. There are many degrees of integration in nature, ranging from the mere point to point network of a crystal or of a sponge or higher plant, to the intimate integration of a higher vertebrate. A human society is intermediate in character, but enormously simpler and less intimate than that of the human nervous system. Much looser still is the pattern of a species or of an ecologic system. The universe as a whole is the external aspect (to each of its components) of the all embracing world of mind that is a necessary postulate of this theory. It appears to us to be only very loosely in tegrated by its gravitational and electromagnetic fields through which interaction between remote parts requires periods of time of</page><page sequence="21">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 285 the order of hundreds of millions of years in contrast with a few hundredths of a second within a human being. It may, however, be as presumptuous of us to evaluate the universe as for a hydrogen ion in the blood stream of a man to evaluate the latter. Freedom of the Will Subjectively, mind seems to involve the continual exercise of choice, within, of course, a limited range of possibilities. How is this freedom to be reconciled with apparent determinism in the behav ior of non-living things? Part of the answer is as already noted that the laws of nature are merely statistical and no more preclude choice on the part of the individual components than do statistical laws of human behavior. There could not be statistical regularity, however, without at least some regularity in the behavior of individuals. Freedom of the will is sometimes considered to be equivalent to caprice, but mere chance is as little compatible with freedom of the will as deter minism. There are indeed two very different models which may be used for more or less predictable behavior. One is mechanical, such as the course of a billiard ball, struck by another, or the motion of a cogwheel, pushed by another. The billiard balls and the cogwheels are, however, aggregations rather than organisms and their highly regular behavior is that of statistical aggregates and need not apply to integrated entities such as single molecules. This is nevertheless the sort of model that is usually thought of in connection with de terminism in science. At the opposite extreme, as a model, is the behavior of a man of firm purpose, who moves toward some goal, in spite of obstacles. His behavior under similar conditions may be predictable to a considerable extent and the more so, the stronger his will. Conditions, however, are never exactly the same. As Pearson wrote: "The causes of any individual thing thus widen out into the unmanageable history of the universe. The causes of any finite portion of the universe lead us irresistibly to the history of the universe as a whole." Every event must thus have a unique aspect. What happens may be one hundred percent the resultant of creative choices of the par</page><page sequence="22">286 THE MONIST ticipants yet there may be sufficient similarities among conditions and among choices of behavior to give the appearance of almost complete determination in the statistics of large numbers. As to the behavior of the individual entities, we have noted that physics itself, since Pearson wrote his Grammar of Science, has had to qualify the idea of complete predictability by Heisenberg's inde terminacy principle. Physical science thus has arrived at statistical mechanics as its ultimate form of statement, rather than determin istic equations. There seems to be nothing in physics that prevents the view that its particles are little creatures, acting essentially like the larger familiar organisms. A human being appears to make choices that make enormous differences in the course of events. How can something that is com posed entirely of molecules have a freedom that transcends the statistical regularity of an aggregation of molecules? The answer is, of course, that a tightly integrated organism operates through a hierarchy of switch or trigger mechanisms. In an action involving a very great exchange of energy, for example the flight of an aero plane, all molecules may follow their customary modes of behavior, except in a small portion of the system (a lever and the pilot) which diverts the course of the whole in one way or another. With in this small portion there may in turn be no detectible swerving from customary behavior except in a switch mechanism of the second order of smallness (a neuro-muscular junction), and so on to transactions of the third order in neural and cerebral synapses. The portion of the total energy exchange involved in controlling the deviation from customary behavior may thus be of the nature of an infinitesimal raised to a high power. Yet the flight is all ac cording to plan. A high degree of freedom of choice of the whole is consistent with highly regular behavior of the parts. On the other hand self-regulatory processes prevent control by minute indeter minacies. The necessity for respecting the choices of the parts does set limits to the freedom of the whole. The dual-aspect panpsychist view requires that each event depend wholly on choice, as the inner aspect of action, but with the whole past history of the universe converging on it, it depends on the resolution of choices of in numerable entities, at all levels in the hierarchy of existence. One can dominate only by ways that involve concurrence of the others.</page><page sequence="23">BIOLOGY AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE 287 Philosophy and Methodology Finally what difference in the methodology of science in general and of biology in particular is indicated by the dual-aspect panpsy chist philosophy as compared with determinism? It might seem that science should concern itself primarily with the inner aspect of reality. Unfortunately we cannot enter into any consciousness but our own. In the human case, we can indeed com pare notes on our introspections and discover regularities. Psycho analysis represents the most serious attempt at such a program. It would be absurd moreover in the social sciences not to avail our selves of all the insight into human nature that we can obtain. The major emphasis must, however, be put on the objective, statis tical account of what human beings actually do. In the natural sciences, we cannot make any check on our inter pretations of the inner life of animals, much less of single cells, molecules, atoms or elementary particles. Man is, indeed, an animal and by trying to separate out a residuum from those aspects of our minds that are associated with distinctively human traits-such as the use of symbolic speech and its consequences, we may perhaps derive some insight into the nature of the stream of consciousness of higher animals, taking due account of special capabilities as exaggerations of things that we perceive in ourselves. This, however, must always remain a top dressing on the solid structure of science, and literary rather than scientific. Apart from this, science must restrict itself to the external aspect of things, largely to classification by kind, and to statistical laws relating to the so-called primary qualities of things: number and form, position in space, and motion, as those aspects of our perceptions on which it has been clearly recognized since the time of Locke, that men can best agree. We measure these in terms of such standard chunks of voluntary action and perception as are embodied in the operational definitions of centimeter, gram, second, etc. There is the philo sophic difference from determinism that we now are to interpret natural laws merely as condensed statistical descriptions of the external aspect of behavior rather than accounts of reality in its totality. A certain danger for science must be squarely face. The accept ance of statistical description as ultimate may lead sometimes to</page><page sequence="24">288 THE MONIST premature abandonment of analysis in cases in which analysis would be pushed farther by one who believes firmly that there is a deterministic mechanism to be found. Pearson, for example, undoubtedly felt more satisfied with a merely statistical account of the resemblances of individuals to their parents and more remote ancestors than did geneticists with a deterministic metaphysics. He violently opposed the Mendelian analysis of heredity after its rediscovery in 1900. The latter runs at once into mere probabilities in the Mendelian ratios but it carries analysis of the basis for these probabilities to deeper levels and gives more insight than a mere regression equation. Pearson seems not to have recognized sufficiently the implica tions of the hierarchic structure of reality. The task of science is not complete until it has followed phenomena through all levels of the hierarchy, up and down as far as possible, and after obtaining the best statistical description at each, has tied them all together. In modern genetics, this has meant working down from the statistical rules at the level of the individual to those of chromosomes and genes and to the chemistry of these, and up again into the physiol ogy of gene action at the levels of cell, tissue, organ and individual and finally to the properties of populations. All statements are ultimately in terms of probabilities but all are related. Acceptance of this point of view requires relatively little change in the actual practice of science, especially as determinism has never been more than an ideal admittedly unrealizable in full because of the invariable errors of observation and in many cases, practically irreductible probabilities like those in the fall of dice (or segrega tion and assortment of genes). The deterministic expressions do not lose their usefulness as approximations. What we are given is a tenable philosophy of science and along with this a desirable humility in the recognition that science is a limited venture, concerned with the external and statistical aspect of events and incapable of dealing with the unique creative aspect of each individual event.
