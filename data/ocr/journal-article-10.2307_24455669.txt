<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNITY OF THE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT MAURICE BLONDEL Maurice Blondel, who died in 1949, is the inspiration in the field of philosophy for much that is most fruitful in the cur rent revival of Christian thought in western Europe. The present article represents Chapters 4 and 5 of his book Exigences philo SOPHIQUES DU CHRISTIANISME (Presses Universitaires, Paris). Is it possible to define the Christian spirit by reduction to a principle of essential unity? T... ,·· J*. HE objection has frequently been pro posed that Christianity, like all historical realities, has been in such constant evolu tion that its development seems at times to result in a contradiction of its own primitive impetus. Some claim to return to Her pristine purity, while others praise Her indefinite plasticity and Her fidelity to a tradition which perpetuates itself only by adapting itself to ever-changing needs. Still others would wish to find the glory of the Church in Her correction, by means of Her realistic sense, of the dreams of the early ages and the illusions of the parousia: a millenarianism appearing anew in every epoch as an expectation of a temporal Kingdom in this world. The difficulty, then, is evident from the outset: If there has been change, can we pre suppose with St. Vincent of Lêrins, as cited by the Vatican Council, that these renovations have always evolved in eodem sensu et in eadem sententia? Such an assertion would force us at the very outset to abandon the idea of an immobility which would fix Christianity in the realm of the abstract, the unreal and the dead past. There can be no questions of a static unity. What we must investigate is the possibility of a really dynamic unity, a continuity of orientation, a fixity in movement, according to the ancient formula: motus fondatur in immobili. When we clarify it in this way, the problem becomes more precise but remains embarrassing because of the difficulty there is in understanding how a directive idea can be simultaneously immobile and mobile. A second source of difficulty is immediately added to the first: If there is a question of a living idea which must assimilate foreign data without losing its own originality, what can be this dominant conception in Christianity under which all other conquests of thought, all the riches of history assemble and unite? In the face of such problems, we shall not be surprised to find that actually many divergent re sponses have been offered and that there has been a remarkable variation in the judgments on what the biologists would call the dominant character of that immense living being which is centuries-old Catholicism. Throughout the ages attempts have been made to classify the Christian syn thesis according to the historical elements which seem to have contributed to its formation. Three principal types of synthesis have been made, embodying three fundamental themes which must be brought into final harmony. Nothing is more</page><page sequence="2">2 CROSS CURRENTS helpful than to determine these notes, which though diverse in origin, have helped to compose the Christian symphony. Let us begin by sounding the themes separately, these melodies which some have tried to harmonize as the most skillful composers employ counterpoint and the richness of musical poly phony. Various Types of Synthesis. 1) By reduction to the idea of a God of Poiuer.—The first theme, which is that of a God of omnipotence, the sovereign Lord and Creator of all things, inaccessible in mystery, the God of Fear and Majesty Whom one could not call by His true Name nor represent by means of any of the attributes whicn thought might invent. (See La philosophie et l'esprit chrétien, vol. 1.) 2) By reduction to the idea of a God of Truth.—Philosophical effort, espe cially when inspired by Hellenic thought, offers us another theme which has also been diffused within the Christian soul: A God of intelligibility, a trans cendent Principle of Truth and Wisdom, a Logos by which all has been made with weight, number and measure. Further, this divine Word, the uncreated Light, is the source of all spirits, which participate in His luminousness and must saturate themselves in His Life and return to Him, the only Mediator and Savior. (See La Pensée, vol. 1.) 3) By reduction to the idea of a God of Charity,—But, together with these two resonant themes, there sounds a strain, more new and more exalted, a theme which more than any other seems to be the Good Tidings. We knew that God is power; we knew that God is truth and intelligence; but did one dare believe that God is charity, not a Good which would remain a neutral factor like a ray of warmth from a burning fire, but an infinitely bountiful Goodness, a Love giving the lie to the cold wisdom of the ancient philosopher for whom^he very idea of a God who could love man seemed scandalous? If there is an original contribution on the part of Christianity, is it not here especially that we shall find it? Certainly it has been said with justice that the miracle of the Jewish people was to conserve, in the midst of a deluge of idolatry, an unwavering monotheistic affirmation of divine Omnipotence and of pure Transcendence. In addition, it has certainly been possible to say that the miracle of the Greek mind was to have conceived spirit, pure thought, supreme reason as the divine Intelligence ordering all things, even though philosophy had never been able to rise to the idea of creation and of divine incommensurability. But that which is truly new is the doctrine, nay more, the apparition, of Incarnate Love striving to the very extreme of love in the gift of His Own life for man. A result, shall we find ourselves face to face with three conceptions which are more or less mutually irreducible or can we hope to resolve these three themes into one identical harmony, while none ceases to be heard in an inspira tion which surpasses and transforms them? This is the problem which we must solve and which is perhaps not quite so simple as it would at first appear. We are so accustomed to unite these conceptions, diverse in nature and origin, that we would willingly believe in their spontaneous agreement. Let us, how ever, avoid self-deception. The study of history reveals that each of these fun</page><page sequence="3">MAURICE BLONDEL 3 damental themes has, in turn, sought to dominate; that, according to the idea which prevails, the subordinate themes and the harmony of the ensemble assume a different tone; and, consequently, that we really find ourselves faced with tendencies which are difficult to reconcile and which give rise even to dis cord. Let us, then, examine these variations of the one doctrine and discover the successive appearances of Christianity according as one emphasizes one or another of these themes which we have enumerated. Perhaps this critical analysis will assist us in seeing more clearly the true unity, the incomparable originality of the Christian spirit which must blend within itself all these nuances, must permit all these variations and still remain animated by a life which none of these elements, of which it seems to be composed, can claim to sustain of itself. From a comparison of talent with genius, it has been said that talent excels in the assembling of scattered ideas into a system where it may employ its deli berate art of ingenious synthesis; thus, we frequently see the rapid success of a work in which contemporaries can recognize themselves and which reveals to them the many facets of the most current truths. Genius, on the contrary, while it assimilates both ancient and current data, contributes a new principle, an inspiration, which, according to the very etymology of the word, animates with a single breath these materials which have previously remained scattered or even unknown. The problem which we must now discuss is that raised by those interpreters who tend to make of Christianity either a mélange of tradi tions and ideas derived from the most diverse points of the Orient and the Occident, from Jewish, Greek or Roman thought—or a theological and philoso phical construct, formed from systematically ordered notions, as certain intel lectuals claim (one of whom has said recently that the Summa dispenses us from having recourse to the Gospel and that the Thirteenth Century marked the terminus ad quem of the Catholic synthesis) —or a sediment, formed and augmented by the overflow of life much more than of thought, by Christian morality more than by dogmatic speculation. As different as they are, do not these interpretations misunderstand the Christian genius, that spirit which more than any work of the most creative human art expresses the divine unity of its origin and its total development? In order better to justify this second alternative, it will be helpful to review those interpretations which consider Christianity, either speculatively or practically, as a juxtaposition or, as the Alexandrians said, a syncretism in which domination is held successively by certain of the associated tendencies and heterogeneous ideas which seem to make of the Catholic religion something of a great river in which one can recognize by their colors the waters from diverse tributaries. Certainly, no one of the three factors previously mentioned could be lacking without the disappearance of Christianity and, in this sense, it is only in the abstract that one can distinguish them. Nevertheless, the role which is attributed to one or another of these components in the synthesis can differ radically and, as a result, we shall see that, according to which of the elements serves as active and dominant principle, we shall find ourselves faced with syntheses which in no way resemble each other. This paradoxical fact occa sions the more and more complete and relentless opposition among Catholic groups which has been a source of scandal to so many. Where agreement and cooperation, certainly at least mutual support, ought to seem easy, since they</page><page sequence="4">4 CROSS CURRENTS are obligatory and salutary, contention has been aroused in a most painful, most tenacious and most prejudicial manner. It is not, then, merely a theoretical problem which much be clarified. There is the question of practical coordina tion of effort, still better of a "unity of spirits in Truth, of a union of hearts in Charity," according to the constant prayer of Pére Pernet. I. The First Form of Catholic Synthesis Based on the Fundamental Idea of a God of Power ■*- OR certain minds which are filled with zeal, captivated by the rights of God and preoccupied with order and authority, the directive idea, the primitive inspiration and the sovereign purpose must be respect for Omnipotence, for Majesty and the demands of a God who can order things ultimately to nothing but Himself. This takes the form of the sublime adoration which prostrates the nothingness which we are before Infinity and absolute Perfection, and the pro found religious sentiment which is actually initium sapientiae, timor Domini. If this idea becomes as primary as it is fundamental, in what guise will the other elements appear in the Christian synthesis? The God of majesty and fear appears also as the God of truth and justice but it is primarily the truth of what has been called absolute theocentricism and. divine egoism. From such a point of view, in what concerns the providential plan, one seeks to understand nothing but the fact of the incomprehensibility of the decrees of the Omnipo tent. In what God wills and does is found the true, the just and the good. Thus, from the summit of theology to the most minute details of political and reli gious disciplines, everything finds its single explanation in this Will Which is one with the Knowledge and Wisdom of the Master and Creator. One can already surmise the nuance which the doctrine of charity assumes here. If the good is what God wills, our love, participating in the divine attitudes and predestinations, attaches itself to and reserves itself for those whom Mercy has drawn from the mass of perdition, while our zeal is so inflamed against those who resist Grace that to compassionate natural miseries and supernatural indigencies is to weaken our resistance to evil, to adopt a spirit of submission and false liberalism and to enter into the camp of the enemy in a semi-betrayal of the holy cause which demands what Tertullian calls the "flame of vengeance." Doubtlessly, we are exaggerating certain traits in order to highlight the danger of the abyss into which certain spirits fall only too logically when a sin cerity which is more ardent than enlightened urges them to call down fire from Heaven upon the enemies of God. Exaggeration, we say, yet are there not numerous cases of that passionate violence which merited for His apostles Christ's words of reproach: "You know not of what spirit you are." Here already we may note the great disadvantage there is in the abstractive isolation of the prin ciples by which one reasons with its risk of contracting the Catholic spirit. In any case, it would seem that it is not on the single idea of such a theocentricism that one must balance Christian thought. We must now see whether we may be more successful when we examine another form of synthesis.</page><page sequence="5">MAURICE BLONDEL II. Can the dominant principle of the Catholic synthesis be derived from the idea of the God of Truth and Pure Intelleclualism? JL ROM the very name of its divine Founder, Christianity seems to find its unity in this eternal Word, the adequate Image of the Father, the unique and supreme Mediator between God and the created order (see the development of this in La Philosophie et L'Esprit chrétien, I), the total Truth whence pro ceeds the Holy Spirit. In this conception which the gnosis has caricatured, the Hellenic idea of the Logos offered a commentary on and a clarification of the evangelical teaching and especially of the texts of St. John on the Light Whose mystical sense is identified with the very sense of truth, the principle of both life and light. Likewise, borrowing from Aristotle the word and the idea of a pure contemplation which would "eternalize" man by permitting him, as it were by a stroke of lightning, to perceive the immutable, this speculative thesis has been transposed into a mysticism in which the notion of vision remains dominant: In this world the intellectual act is the highest degree to which the spirits of the elect can attain and in the future it is contemplation which will constitute the supreme and beatifying term. Under such an inspiration, what becomes of the other ideas which have seemed indispensable for the Christian synthesis? Divine power is intimately associated with intelligence which is the essential law of power. God sees Him self and in Himself all the possibles, all the essences and intelligible natures. Will is understood here as the expression of an infinite Wisdom. Truth is not a creature; it is the Creator Himself. The motto which dominates everything and which demands primary consideration is the word: Veritas. (Neverthe less, how rich and admirable is that motto of a great religious order which can so magnificently unite contemplation and instruction, speculative research and the apostolate of charity.) From this follows the tendency to subordinate all rule to a discipline founded on science according to the oft-repeated formula: sapientis est ordinare. Further, if wisdom incorporates elements which at first do not seem to be of a theoretic nature, little by little a secret dialectic brings about the statement of a thesis and a practice according to which wisdom itself is finally reduced to pure science and pure theory. Finally, what becomes of the idea of charity in this synthesis which is so deliberately intellectualistic? The divine Essence is considered as naturally dif fusive of the good, just as fire is naturally diffusive of heat: Bonum est diffusivum sui, says the ancient adage which employs the neuter form as if to emphasize the presence of a factor which is constitutive, intelligible and, one might say, imper sonal. Thus, finally, the other formula: ens, verum, bonum et unum convex tuntur, that is, being, goodness and unity are identified with truth and in truth itself. There results, then, that imperturbable calm of the Christian who, once he has demonstrated the reasons which procure for him a scientific faith, poses his doctrine indifferently, without consideration of persons and without concern for the erring and the ignorant. While discussing a philosopher who was plagued with doubt and for whose misfortune I expressed pity, a person of great sincerity said to me one day: "One ought not be disturbed by individual misfortunes. In our perspective it is truth alone which matters. We never take persons into con</page><page sequence="6">A CROSS CURRENTS sideration. Charity is only in the truth; it suffices to show the truth. So much the worse for those who cannot or will not see the truth."—Recently, in a con ference given at the Sorbonne before the Société pour l'étude des idées nouvelles, someone defended this thesis: "The modern world proceeds on its way, the Church on Hers. So much the better for those upon whom Grace has descended. We have only to allow the others to follow their own paths." It is by such a logic that one justifies the role of those "atheistic catholics", as certain unbelieving defenders of the Faith have been called. One cannot, it is said, be angry with them if they have not received the Grace to believe, and we must rejoice all the more in the services which they have rendered to Truth by discovering the human aspects involved therein or by their procedures—the use of which is authorized by their very incredulity, while religious scruples might constrain the audacity of the faithful. In a celebrated letter to Albert de Mun, Louis Veuillot declared that a well-aimed saber-blow could be the greatest act of charity. Without carrying the paradox so far, many persons have subordinated the degree of their charity to their conception of truth, a truth which they often reduce to their own conception, their own spirit and their own perspective of clan, parish, caste, tradition or personal interest. However great and necessary it may be, the idea of truth runs the risk of distorting a properly Catholic conception and of forming from the very name of Christianity a partisan cry, while it is of paramount importance to recall the saying: Deus vult omnes salvos fieri. Christ died for all and one can love and imitate Him only by embracing all men, even the most unworthy, in an infinitely charitable solicitude. Are we to say, then, that, if there is an idée maîtresse, an original principle, a single soul of Christian inspiration, it is this affirmation of St. John: Deus caritas est? III. Is Charity the dominant and unifying principle of the Christian spirit? WE Ε HEAR it frequently repeated that God is love, that it is by love that one may recognize the disciples of Him Who promulgated this new command ment, the greatest of all commandments, as He Himself says: "He who has love for God and for his neighbor has fulfilled the entire law"; all else disappears, charity alone perisheth not but endureth eternally. Let us, nevertheless, examine the consequences which follow at times upon an abstract and, one might say, a logical consideration of charity in an erroneous application of the counsel: Ama et fac quod vis. This beautiful expression of St. Augustine, although it has a most lofty meaning in the perspective in which its author understood it, runs the risk of distorting the Christian spirit. At various times in history we have seen the danger of a doctrine which places a total emphasis on charity alone. Thus, Joachim of Floris in the twelfth century claimed that the liberal spirit of love was going to succeed, and rightfully so, the reign of the Father and the Son, that is, of Power and Intelligence. In this way, many illusions have germinated in the inflamed imaginations of heterodox mystics and in hearts more ardent than enlightened or pure. Perhaps, too, in our own times, we might discover traces of a generous fervor which, under pre</page><page sequence="7">MAURICE BLONDEL 7 tense of exalting divine Goodness, fails to realize the salutary rigors of Christian asceticism. In such cases, what becomes of the idea of divine Power, of Majesty and Transcendence, which constitute the abyss of incommensurability between the Creator and the nothingness which He has called into existence? Of this power is preserved only the notion that there is nothing impossible to the inventive ness and the humiliations of infinite Love. The immediate inference is made from this that God has given us to ourselves in order that we might enjoy the merits and the satisfaction of restoring ourselves to Him Who gives Himself to us in exchange for that very restoration. Thus, all distance disappears in a famil iarity which causes certain modern Origens to lapse finally into the same error as the great thinker of the East: God is so good that He will condemn no one and Hell is but the threat which one proposes to children in order to make them more wise through fear of the bogey-man. In this synthesis, where the idea of charity becomes the directive or even the exclusive principle, what becomes of the idea of essential truth and of fundamental intelligibility? There is a growing refusal to found the Christian order on a system of necessary truths and a rejection, perhaps not without some reason, of the notion of a God Who is identified with an essence, the source of all other essences, Who remains Himself transcendent to all created nature. Such a theory refuses even to hesitate in the face of this difficulty: How can there be a union of charity where there is incommensurability of nature? There is rather a tendency to relegate that question to the domain of abstractions and of false ontologies which discuss entia rationis as if there were question of the most positive existences. Thus, one might condemn en bloc, as if they were the remains of idolatry, all assertions relative to the distinction between human nature and the pure Spirit which is God, in Whom essence and existence are one, while there is in creatures an irreducible distinction between nature and con crete existence. And when we attempt to recall this metaphysically ineluctable heterogeneity, we irritate, as if we remained attracted by mere verbalisms, instead of seeing in God only a Father Whom nothing could separate from His children. Grave are the consequences of this superficial optimism which would remove every obstacle and every separation but which, by its very nature, as we shall later see, humbles God instead of elevating man and thus humbles human des tiny by failing to realize the supreme exigencies of divine Charity. Later we shall have to explain at greater length how this pretended charity —which is considered primary and made easier to attain and more extensive in its control—is cruelly deceptive and destructive of divine Goodness, which has infinitely more ambition for us than have these slaves of a human charity measured in terms of our own personality. At this point it is necessary to de nounce this misinterpretation in order to clarify the negative conclusion to which we have finally arrived and which prepares us for a more comprehensive understanding of Catholic unity. This negative conclusion is that the analysis which we have employed in this rapid survey implies that our discursive reflection succeeds only in decom posing or recomposing the Christian spirit, such as it is in the soul where it lives mysteriously. Now, this implies a false presupposition. One may say, then, that to the extent that one has claimed to dissect the Christian sense, dissect its</page><page sequence="8">8 CROSS CURRENTS organism, reconstruct a synthesis by means of explicit knowledge, one has rather killed than vivified. Not that such analysis must be abandoned, but it is useful and salutary only in a perspective different from that in which it has so fre quently been placed. It has often been remarked that what touches and en lightens souls is certainly less a long labor of erudition, logic or eloquence than a spiritual contact or the encounter with sanctity. It has even been added at times, that the spark which enkindles Faith is produced outside of and above all the materials which have been laboriously accumulated to prepare the light and kindle the spark. We are to conclude, then, that we have not yet found the true terrain where the sacred flame kindles, grows warm and leaps upwards. It remains to make a considerable effort, one which places us on our guard against the insufficiencies and the deceptions of that which Dechamps called the im portant science of learned demonstrations. But someone might ask: Is it possible and permissible to penetrate without violation into this domain which is profoundly obscure and sacredly reserved for the encounter of the soul with God? Is not the Catholic spirit a living mystery, inaccessible to the learned, one which reveals itself only to the simple and to the humble, be they the most learned of men? For one becomes a believer only by casting off indiscreet curiosity and by consenting to enter beyond the veil, where Denys the Areopagite said we should find only impenetrable mist and "the great Darkness". This, then, is the question to be discussed, even though we should arrive at the conclusion that actually we can encounter only obscurity. Nevertheless, let us hope that there again we will be able to justify and to practice rationabile obsequium. On the Method which Leads to the Realm where the indissoluble unity of the Christian spirit takes life. jLF IT seems difficult to define the Christian spirit, may the cause of the diffi culty not be found in the use of a method which is insufficient and imperfectly adapted to its object? It is possible, even intended, that what precedes should leave the impression of restless ambiguity. Doubtlessly there is a legitimate and providential variety in the Catholic unity,—m dubiis libertas et multiformes viae Dei diversa quoque dona spiritus. Nevertheless, that variety need not lead to a basic diversity, still less to internal contrariety: In necessariis unitas. Further, if we must add, according to the adage falsely attributed to St. Augustine, in omnibus caritas, this charity must not consist in closing one's eyes in order the better to open one's heart. While we give credit generously and grant a humble welcome to all, it is necessary that charity lead ever more firmly to the funda mental and definitive unity of souls in the light, as well as in the love, of Christ. Otherwise, Christianity would be a mere signpost on a meeting place for ideas as has been asserted frequently and erroneously. Let us not blame those who never compromise the demands of dogma. Pascal said: "Truth is not truth without charity"; yet, it is necessary to add in compensation: Charity is not charity without the scrupulous search for and service of Truth. In order to take into account the hesitations and the conflicts which may at times trouble the Christian conscience or halt many an unbeliever along the</page><page sequence="9">MAURICE BLONDEL 9 path of return or of approach to the faith, we must attempt to find those factors which consitute the insufficiency of method and which in our former study have not allowed us to attain that unity of perspective in which everything is unraveled in an orderly manner before the soul's eyes upon the confused stage of the world. Three principal causes seem to explain the failure in the frequent attempts to determine, from the philosophical or apologetical point of view, the intimate nature of Catholicism, to Which so often apply the words of the precursor of Christ: "There is one among you whom you know not." One thinks that he knows Catholicism and that he can even judge it, because he has a day by-day familiarity with it. But these ceaseless encounters fail to reveal its secret and even help to cause an ignorance of it, just as psychologists have pointed out the paradox that those who are accustomed to a house are often less cap able of describing it from memory than a visitor with his more recent and more vivid impressions. But let us put aside such secondary details which could be multiplied not only in the psychological order but in the moral order as well. Let us examine the causes which conceal the most essential ba%js of Christian thought even for the most attentive and most impartial of witnesses or critics. First of all, some seem only too willing to reason concerning the Catholic spirit as if it were entirely subject to analysis. We have adopted to such an extent the scientific habit of dividing difficulties in the Cartesian manner, of breaking apart brute bodies, of dissecting living bodies and examining the sub conscious or the unconscious in their most minute details that our presumption and our ambition is to attain in such a way the end of all ends, the ultimate basis of all things, even the secrets of spirits, of divine operations, of mystic states and of supernatural union. Thus arises that curiosity which in our day entices so many believers or unbelievers, towards investigations from which they hope to draw the key to the mystery.—Now, even in the study of nature, this method which is too exclusively analytical, remains notably inadequate. It allows that spark to escape, without which no synthesis is possible; and to the extent that analysis, which never touches upon this spark nor brings it under its scalpel, prescinds from it without hesitating to declare that it is a method exhaustive of total reality, it becomes mutilating, deceptive and murderous. And still more, when it is no more a question of inferior nature but of operations which, by hypothesis, imply divine assistance, such analytic methods are fatally doomed to misrepresent the very object which they seek to grasp in its intimate and indivisible unity. A second cause, related to the first, explains even more clearly the semi defeats which we have found. We attempted to reunite the diverse sources from which the Christian spirit was derived both historically and doctrinally. By mak ing analyses concerning the facts, ideas and states of conscience and by trans forming these data into notions as distinct as possible, we asked ourselves how such conceptions, formed in isolation and more or less disparate, could have assembled into a living organism. Nothing can be more chimerical than such a claim. Nevertheless, it is so common that we fail to notice that it destroys in advance that which it wishes to explain and justify. If Christianity implied such a method, it would not be a religion, being neither one nor religious. It would be a syncretism of beliefs and speculations mingled with facts; but it would</page><page sequence="10">10 CROSS CURRENTS not proceed from a superior principle to disparate phenomena which are by nature subalternate and mutable. There is a third cause and a fresh consequence of the two errors of method which we have just noted (and it is on this point that we may best notice the remedy which must be applied to such harmful deficiencies). If Christianity had actually been formed by means of elements furnished by analysis and by a grouping of notions which were elaborated in the abstract, it would result entirely from accommodations and adaptations and it would have arisen post factum as a complement of a life already constituted and of a spontaneity to which it would attach itself in an extrinsic manner without deriving anything of its vital force from the natural and rational order. Thus it is that it has often been considered a superadded burden, worse still, as a restraining intrusion, a spoil-sport, a mortification arbitrarily and gratuitously burdensome. Among the objections which restrain cultivated minds, there is none more tenacious nor more noxious than this: Christianity arises as an accident in the normal life of humanity; historically, it was a patch-work construct; philosophically, it is repulsive to principles discovered by science and metaphysics; morally, it molds passive and submissive characters, without real virility, without initiative and without nobility of soul. I found in the notes of a candidate for the bacca laureate this statement which, as was subsequently discovered, actually came from the professor: "The so-called state of sanctity is an immoral state."—One can see from this synoptic picture the serious mass of grievances which a wrong method of exposition may accumulate so unjustly against the Christian spirit. It is precisely our task to discover the antidote for such a conception of Chris tianity and for a method which is so disastrous. JL ROM the point of view which we will assume, we shall show that the objec tions enumerated thus far will on the contrary be transformed into clear and favorable proofs: those factors which seemed to contradict each other will demand and complete each other. This is true both for the metaphysical order and for the preambles of faith. It will be still more true for those truths which are properly Christian and for the unity of revealed doctrine. In other words, where we seemed to find disparate data and rising conflict, there will appear agreement, still more, implications and aspects of a unity which no analysis could really destroy. How often, in our human modes of thought and speech, we place the divine attributes in opposition one to the other, as if in mutual contradiction or limitation. Nevertheless, reason like faith should elevate our minds above this anthropomorphic mode of speech, so that, though we may not fully comprehend, we may at least catch sight of and affirm the essential sim plicity and the perfect unity of God. What is true from the metaphysical point of view we can still more easily recognize in the order of supernatural wisdom where power, knowledge and goodness, whose fictitious opposition we have already seen, are fundamentally but a unique Providence. But how are we to conceive this perspective which seems to surpass our human mode of knowledge and of instruction? It does not suffice to point out the insufficiencies of our thought and our speech, nor merely to discard the in</page><page sequence="11">MAURICE BLONDEL 11 conveniences which result from them: in divinis, multum deficit omnis cogniti humana, as the Scholastic adage says. The problem is to know whether, despite these deficiencies, we can in a positive and legitimate manner, place ourselves, if not in the divine center of unity, at least, through a fusion of reason and Revelation, at a point where the discordances and oppositions, which create the basic objections against Christianity, will disappear. In order to do this, it is necessary to reconsider the entire problem of human destiny. Can man as he is in reality be sufficient unto himself and give a satisfying solution to his thought, to his personal and social life, to his superior inclina tions and his religious aspirations? Or, from the lowest to the highest levels of human experience and in the most rigorous analysis, do mental clarity and moral probity demand that we recognize a radical and incurable insufficiency? If this latter affirmation is the only one which responds to our historical state and to our philosophical inquiry, is it possible to go beyond the mere admission of the fact? In the face of this void, is it legitimate to examine the edges of the abyss, to observe and draw some positive lesson from such contingency, such defect, from such emptiness which seems at first entirely negative? This fact must be emphasized: This void is called such only in contrast with the apparent and false plenitude of those experiences which never reach their goal and which themselves should be called negative rather than satisfying: vanitas vanitatum. In addition to the fact that this void of which we speak is not fictitious, since it is found as the climax of every reality experienced, it must be added that it represents the very antithesis of that which finally appears to us as vain, inconsistent and weakening. As a result, one can say that, despite the mystery and the indeterminacy with which it appears to us, such an abyss of obscurity is invincibly conceived as containing the maximum of being, the term of our aspirations, the only plenitude which does not deceive. We have just reproduced by a purely experimental and rational procedure the very expressions and the teachings of a John of the Cross who seeks being only in the obscurity of night and in nothingness. Still, we must be on our guard against the temptation to which so many metaphysicians and pseudo mystics have succumbed by leaving in absolute indétermination this supreme term of speculation. It is here that we shall have to insert the concrete data of history and of revelation and to justify the attitude of a St. Teresa who pro tests most forcefully against all who, in order to attain "the God without form," would wish to set aside the humanity of Christ as a simple means easily super seded. The Christian spirit would disappear to the extent that it becomes a sort of gnosis and an idealism divorced from incarnate realities. It is, then, more than ever necessary not only to show that supernatural faith supposes and com pletes the entire edifice of nature and of reason which serve as its basis (just as the human composite serves as support for the spirit in this world and in the future life), but constantly to reattach the most lofty Christian speculation to the concrete data of history, to the experiences of popular piety and to the most humble devotions, to the love of the details in which the lives of Christ, of the Virgin and of the saints have become incarnate. There are those who would hope to ascend by freeing themselves from the pretended "childhood" of Christianity; truly, they lose the Catholic sense without gaining (quite the contrary) the sense either of philosophy or of humanity.</page><page sequence="12">12 CROSS CURRENTS , HUS, little by little we shall see assembling within a single scheme elements which at first are most opposite—the most lofty philosophical speculation and the devotion of an unlearned child, the secret of the entire creation and the apparition at a point in space and time of a fact which appears infinitesimal and totally disproportionate with that immensity of centuries, of generations and universes. Still more, in the moral as in the philosophical and historical order, it will be necessary that contrasts be founded in the same light and that the rigorous demands of the Divine shall be seen, in the words of Dante, to take birth from the first and incomparable love. Only on that condition can one hope to arrive at the unique and incomparable spirit of authentic Christ ianity. But, as is easily seen, the task required by the method proposed is actually immense and we shall be able to plot out only certain landmarks which are meant to orientate our research in the manner in which Catholic tradition has always proceeded (often without pausing to discuss them) towards the resolution of the many objections which harry her progress. This synthesis, it is true, cannot be achieved for us in this life with that perfect unity which remains a pledge and a promise for the celestial Jerusalem. But, as Newman said, even in the infirmity of our earthly thought, it is good always to realize and even to possess to some small degree the presence of the blessed vision of peace and of unity. One would not participate in the Christian spirit, one would not even be able to speak of it in any way whatsover, if he did not have some realization of the final harmony of nature, reason, faith and the union of Grace.
