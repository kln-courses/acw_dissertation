Despite their differences on the divine nature, both rejected anthropomorphism. In conclusion, Babut is to be commended for treating a large and complex subject with care and in detail. The book is a mine of useful information, and though it will probably have primary interest for students of Plutarch, it should also have attrait for those of Stoicism. The notes usually contain references to the most recent work on Plutarch, though it is unclear why Babut refers to Ziegler's 1949 edition of Plutarchos and not to that in B.-E., XII, 1951. Greek is used intelligently, the text sometimes quoted in full, usually in the footnotes. The book contains a selective bibliography, indices locorum et nominum, and an unbound list of addenda et corrigenda. There are, however, two uncorrected misprints: on p. 367, line 12 read "l'alliance" instead of "'lalliance" ; on p. 538 in the title of Hadzsits' article read "first" instead of "fisrt." JACKSON P.

Short books should get short reviews; it will therefore save space to refer to two competent reviewers (M. Ostwald, C. W., LXIV [1971], pp. 164-5; A. Boegehold, A. H. R., LXXVI [1971], p. 752) who have pointed out both the importance of the oath in antiquity and the need for an up-to-date, comprehensive account of the subject and then gone on to show that Oath and Perjury fails to fill that need, and that Plescia has, among other things, garbled the Greek sources, misrepresented institutions, and given imprecise references and wrong spellings of terms and names. This is, unfortunately, all true, but it would not suffice just to add further examples of such faults, though they are not far to seek: to Ostwald's list of misspellings one could add Cirrhae (p. 62), Orpheism (p. 88), and Antiochus (p. 68, for Antiochis); to Boegehold's list of misrepresented institutions, the contorted account of the diaitetai (p. 37); and within the first four pages one meets at least two examples of fractured Greek: the extraordinary notion (p. 2) that the phrase epi martyroi exists, and means "sureties" as distinct from " witnesses," and the rendering of Ne Dia (p. 4) as "Yes, by God" which obscures the fact that we are dealing with 489</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. a pagan society and that Zeus was the most potent of the theoi horkioi. All this only shows that the book is of little use to scholars but does not suggest how potentially misleading it may be to laymen and students. The book's external attractiveness of title, format, length, and general readability, and the fact that it has been called "a useful introduction" lead me to cite a few of the historical errors which, taken together with the other faults, may caution others that the work can do more harm than good. Few will want their students to come away with the impression that: Solon and Cleisthenes enfranchised masses of people; in the Boule "each prytany [was] elected by .. one of the ten tribes "; the bouleutic oath was instituted by Solon (pace Aristotle; and no ref. to I. G., I 2, 114 and its sizable bibliography); the Delian League was founded in 477/6; the allies were subjects from the beginning because they paid phoros and swore to have the same friends and enemies; Pericles' proposed panhellenic congress was a sham; the sophists caused rather than reflected the decline in piety in the fifth century, and the resulting difficulty in administering oaths is mirrored in a fragment of Xenophanes; in 375 "Athens was about to rebuild its second league"; the fateful peace conference at Sparta in the summer of 371 was in 373; Aeschines' famous speech before the Amphictyons at the April meeting in 339 was delivered in 357; this precipitated the Third Sacred War and the intervention of Philip; Philip was a representative of the Macedonian people in the Hellenic League; federal states appeared [only] from the end of the fourth century. In conclusion one must concede that this book could after all be of use to a person interested in making a serious study of ancient oaths; to him it will furnish proof that the work still needs to be done. Drakon's Law is a solid contribution both to the history of Athenian law and to Attic epigraphy. Stroud's thorough restudy of I. G., I2, 115 (the first since 1867, while the bibliography con- tinued to grow on the basis of the old text) has added over 200 letters which, though they often confirm Koehler's restorations, render many supplements and fond theories obsolete. Stroud gives a new text with translation, epigraphical commentary (best read with one eye on fig. 1), historical commentaries on both the decree of 409/8 (which orders the Anagrapheis to republish, not revise, the law) and the law itself. The most exciting new readings which add to the text are in lines 6 and 56. The first shows that: 1) the source of the document was the King, who therefore must have had an archive of the laws which covered cases falling under his jurisdic- tion, and 2) the redundant phrase kata prytaneian was no part of the fifth-century title of the Secretary of the Boule. The new readings in line 56 reveal that the stele continued with a second and perhaps a third Axon of Drakon's law, which leads Stroud to a convincing interpretation of the troublesome initial kai and to the necessary conclusions that: 1) Drakon (and Platon!) dealt with unpremeditated murder first; premeditated, second, and 2) Drakon's protos axon was and remained distinct from Solon's. The new 490</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS. readings which merely preclude earlier restorations are less exciting but not less important in clearing the decks for further action; in dealing with these often controversial matters Stroud has shown that polemic is not a necessary part of epigraphy. A final chapter explores Drakon's official position, the scope of his legislation, and the historical setting. For this Stroud claims no originality, but he presents a full and well-reasoned, if chrono- logically orthodox, account. This is a book which no one interested in Athenian institutions will want to do without and one which will do much " to establish a reputation for epigraphical reliability" for the University of California Press. FORDYCE W. MITCHEL. UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI. L. P. WImKINSON. The Georgics of Virgil, A Critical Survey. Cambridge University Press, 1969 Pp. xii + 364. $12.50. Mr. Wilkinson has set about to rectify the regrettable situation that there has been no English book devoted exclusively or even in major part to a critical treatment of the Georgics. It can be stated at the outset that he has not simply fulfilled his goal, but has produced a book that will stand for some time as definitive. In fact, he has produced a model for all who would attempt a critical survey of any classical work. It is both comprehensive and rational in its approach. The comprehensiveness of the work can be seen from the fact that its chapters are devoted to topics ranging from the "Early Life of Virgil" to "The Georgics in After Times." These are followed by a series of appendices to which the author has relegated " documentation of recent controversies on various topics," including structure, numerical schematism, the Aristaeus epyllion, etc. Over these he exhibits considerable impatience (especially the numeri in Appendix II) and rightly does not clutter the body of his work with quibbling. He does, however, give his own reasoned account of the structure of the poem in Chapter IV and devotes another chapter (V) to the Aristaeus episode, flatly rejecting Servius' statements concerning it as a substitute for an original praise of Gallus. The general sanity of Wilkinson's approach can be seen not only from his organization, but from his refusal through the work to fantasize. He is clearly, and in the reviewer's opinion wholesomely, in rebellion against the "modern craze for finding symbolism in everything," and he dares to ask the question: " Why should every- thing have to be interpreted ? " By 'interpreting' he clearly means taking the written word for other than (and sometimes dead opposite to) what it purports to be. This will bring him (indeed has brought him: see M. C. J. Putnam in C. P., LXV [1970], pp. 258 f.) the rebuke of the "new" critics, but it is the opinion of the reviewer that of the two types of criticism, that represented by Wilkinson will fifty years hence prove to be the less quaint. 491</page></plain_text>
