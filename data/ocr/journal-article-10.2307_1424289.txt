<plain_text><page sequence="1">Body, Memory, and Architecture. Kent C Bloomer and Charles W Moore. New Haven, Yale University Press, 1977. Body, Memory, and Architecture appears to be both an elaboration of Kent C Bloomer's article "The Body Matrix" (JAE: Vol XXIX, No 1) and an attempted clarification of the architectural attitudes about place and empathy expressed in the two books with which Charles Moore's name has been recently associated, The Place of Houses (Moore, Allen and Turnbull, 1974) and Dimensions: Space, Shape and Scale in Architecture (Moore and Allen, 1976). As might be expected, there are similarities between these works. The previously successful essay and "walking tour" format has been retained and the literary enterprise is again collective. When something is promised, an expec- tation is established. Although the authors promise an optimistic book, our expecta- tions are largely unfulfilled. Bloomer and Moore optimistically contend that the "landmarks and order of our bodies" create a universally comprehensible basis for the "extension of human identity into our environment" and that "the world abounds in successful and even inspiring examples of that extension." Yet, in the Epilogue their optimism is not extended to housing because "there are no schemes for multi-family housing or large-scale urban reconstruction that satisfy all the senses of the body and the nurture the memory as well." The reason for this lack of sensibil- ity, we are told, is because large architec- tural offices regard human habitation as a problem of organization and therefore "cannot address the concerns we [the au- thors] are addressing." Bloomer and Moore feel "the basic act is not organizing but caring; the architect's client is not undifferentiated society but caring individuals." This little homily probably explains why Sea Ranch has been left off the walking tour and also why that fashionably ubiquitous photo of the birth of Post-Modernism, the demolition of Pruitt-Igoe, is included. Clearly, the Marlboro Man cares while the Modular Man didn't. But a book is more than a promise and an end. Robert Yudell's contribution on body movement is an outstanding treat- ment of an often confusing concept. He is able to explain how experiences are and can be intensified through the contrasts and correspondences inherent in "highly energized" or memorable spaces. It is the most lucid and concise discussion on sub- jective and objective movement since that of Robert Gillam Scott a generation ago. Undoubtedly, anthropomorphic and psychic awareness of real experience is im- portant for architects and a genuine under- standing of these issues is particularly im- portant for students. However, some of the conclusions in this book, and not just those about multi-family housing, are troubling. For example, the authors pre- sent a six-chapter discourse reminiscent of a Reader's Digest condensed book on the history of the theory and history of sense perception and aesthetics, and then ask the reader to accept as a logical consequence that "the form of the body" unconsciously but insufficiently "dictates" the form of the city. And, since the resultant urban forms do not always generate feelings of "public possession," they feel that the newly aware architect should "localize" experiences haptically so that the city can "belong to its constituency," thus implying an obvious opportunity to regain that which Ratio- nalism has denied us all. Clearly, the brave new world should be empathetic, but if urban form follows feel- ing, can heightened body-image awareness eradicate poverty, crime, disease and the rest of the painfully familiar urban litany? The purpose of a theory, particularly a comprehensive one, should be to explain phenomena and process, not to laboriously oversimplify complex conditions. Taken on its face, Body, Memory, andAr- chitecture appears to be an attempt to re- claim some of the architectural bath water, if not the baby, which went out the window with the acceptance of the International Style in America. However, the overt and literal attention to anthropomorphism leads one to conclude that the author's primary concern lies with the infant's cor- pus rather than with what it represents- John McDermott, Ohio State University.</page></plain_text>
