<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shakespeare's Pastoral Comedy. By Thomas McFarland. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1972. Pp. x+218 pages. $8.75. The core of Thomas McFarland's study consists in the readings of five com edies?Love's Labor s Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream, As You Like It, The Winter s Tale, and The Tempest?which make substantial use of the pastoral tradition. His aim is the modest and sensible one of clarifying the plays "as unique works of art" rather than as illustrations of a theory (p. 48), but anyone who sets out to write a book about Shakespeare's plays today must, of course, have a particular view of them to justify the enterprise. Professor McFarland has chosen to look at these five plays in their relation ship to a theory of comedy and what he calls "its pastoral extension." Pastoral, that is, seems in certain respects to reinforce and extend the comic vision. Although the author lives up to his intention of not imposing a theory on the plays, this theory is the least satisfactory part of the book, and its occasional effects on the interpretation of individual plays are unfortunate. The chapter on "Comedy and Its Pastoral Extension," the longest in the book, begins with some unexceptionable generalizations about the social orientation of comedy as opposed to tragedy's concern with the heroic individual. As one generalization follows another, however, in the age-old effort to say what is comedy, troublesome complications ensue. For example, "comic character types, rather than comic plots" are said to "generate the primary meaning of comedy," since they are "deviants from the social norm. And comic plot is designed to remove the threat of such deviance" (p. 11). Yet comedy depends, not on a character alone, but "upon its form as a whole," and the superiority of Shakespeare, Aristophanes, Moli?re, and Ben Jonson as comic writers to Chaucer, Rabelais, and Cervantes is explained by the claim that "in these dramas . . . the most significant of social deviations are inter</page><page sequence="2">ii8 Waith woven into the most intricate patterns of plot to achieve the most satisfying afBrmations of a unified society" (p. 12). Is it useful, then, to insist that plot, which is essential to comic form, does not generate its primary meaning? Later on, the importance of plot is further elevated by the pronouncement (and the chapter abounds in pronouncements): "For comedy is precisely a strategy of obtaining security from the threats of life" (p. 16). Complications also enter into the discussion of laughter. It is the test of comedy (p. 16), yet "merely a comic tool" which "has no necessary relationship to the comic essence" (p. 18); it is "the group's way of identifying, and rejecting, a devi ance from its standards" (p. 18), although comedy relies on laughter "to achieve its healing aim" (p. 30). It is difficult to avoid the impression that more work was needed to give solidity and clarity to these generalizations. A section on the shared concerns of comedy and pastoral leads to "a con sideration of the phenomenon of play" in some of the most interesting pages of this chapter. But it is only when the author relates play to men's fears of death that he begins to open up the sublime prospects of what he considers "the final meanings of comedy" (p. 32): "the representation of paradise," "the reclamation of childhood," "a sacramental activity" (p. 37), the pro jection of a Golden Age (pp. 42 ff.), "the reciprocity of social and religious concern" (p. 48), to name a few of the peaks in this mountain range. In the course of reaching these heights one stumbles over some unexpected opinions : that the four late romances are among the "bitter comedies," and that Shake speare's "revulsion against human society and all its ideals" probably was, after all, what made him write this way (p. 19); that comedy is always opposed to romantic love and that the "chief comic process in As You Like It is a rebuking of Orlando's pastorally extravagant love" (p. 27) ; or that "with hints from Vitruvius and, more explicitly, Serlio, stage scenery of the English Renaissance began to represent a town as the normal background for comic action" (p. 29, my emphasis). Throughout the book, but most conspicuously in this chapter, which testifies to the remarkably wide range of McFarland's reading, his system of refer ence for quotations is erratic. Sometimes he gives none at all, and alas for the benighted reader who does not know where to find Freud's comments on games or Helen Gardner's "well-known essay on As You Like It." Sometimes the standard information is provided in parentheses (these references seem to occur more often for copyrighted material), and occasionally in a footnote indicated by one or two asterisks. Though the author may have thought he was merely avoiding the pedantry of numbered scholarly footnotes, he over looked the convenience of the reader who might want the information he omits and might prefer to see the longer references together at the foot of the page or the end of the book. Of the five chapters on the comedies the one devoted to "Disintegration and Reunion in The Winter s Tale" seems to me the most successful. Here the interpretation fortunately rises above the limitations implied by the term "bitter comedy," for after seeming to justify it by saying in the opening para graph that "the redemption provided by pastoral is as bittersweet as the idea of winter's beauty itself" (p. 122), McFarland ends by commenting on "the special strain of intense gladness finally achieved in this play" (p. 144). I offer three instances where the ideas contained in the first chapter seem to affect interpretation adversely: First, the notion that comedy is always op</page><page sequence="3">Rook Reviews 119 posed to romantic love leads to the statement that As You Like It, "even more than Twelfth Night, rejects romantic love as a social sickness" (p. 112). The trouble here is a failure to recognize that ridicule of the conventions of romantic love is as common a feature of the literature of romance as are anti-Petrarchan sallies in Petrarchan poetry. Rosalind's love for Orlando is as romantic as his for her, and such love, in this play and many others, is one of the healing and uniting forces leading to (not opposed to) marriage, the great affirmation of social values which McFarland constantly emphasizes. Second, to stress game and artifice in these comedies is appropriate, but when nothing in the game is taken seriously?when not even the renunciation of women is seen as a "serious deviation" in Love's Labor s Lost (p. 50) and when Titania's description of a world disordered by her quarrel with Oberon is described as "overwhelmingly ideal" (p. 84), a vision of paradise?then the dramas, deprived of obstacles and opposing forces, are flattened out. Of course the behavior of Navarre or of Titania has none of the resonance of Othello's renunciation of love or Lady Macbeth's confounding of nature, but if we recognize no threat in these comedies, the game is hardly worth playing. For McFarland "A Midsummer Night's Dream moves in dreamlike sequences as if on the brink of an eternal bliss" (p. 78), but this is to settle for a rather dreamlike impression of the play. Finally, the emphasis on "religious concern" and "sacred community" in comedy (p. 48) leads to a parabolic interpretation of Prospero as "the Ancient of Days" (p. 155). Though there is no question that Prospero's design often appears to be a metaphor for providence, to see him as a representation of God is to make the ending of the play incomprehensible. Why, then, should he divest himself of divinity (p. 170)? Why should "the anthropomorphic fig ure of the divine" (p. 174) have to be persuaded by Ariel that forgiveness is preferable to vengeance? Following the chapter on The Tempest comes an extraordinary appendix on "Falstaff as a Pastoral Outcast," in which Falstaff is presented not only as similar to Socrates (p. 181), but as a "disappointed idealist" (p. 184), and, in one part of his paradoxical nature, a representative of "a better order" (p. 211) than the Prince, who, after all these years, is once more portrayed as a despicable betrayer. This is not the place to take arms against that old sea of troubles, and it appears that opposing will not end them. Morgann lives! Eugene M. Waith Yale University</page></plain_text>
