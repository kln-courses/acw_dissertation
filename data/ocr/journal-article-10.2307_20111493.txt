<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANATOL RAPOPORT University of Chicago MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND SIGNIFICS In a society where great emphasis is placed on specialization and division of labor, there is likely to develop a notion that knowledge and techniques fall into 'natural' divisions, each pertaining to some discrete, well-defined aspect of living. One can of course, take issue with the 'naturalness' of the divisions. Like any other classification, division of knowledge and techniques into autonomous specialties can be justified on pragmatic grounds. Instead of asking. 'What are the 'natural* divisions ?' one may ask, 'Given such and such classific ation, what can be achieved ?' The achievements of specialization are evident. Modern science and industry are so complex and the standards of scholarship so ex acting that it is impossible for any one to master more than a narrow sector of knowledge. If achievements are measured by the extent to which man can know and manipulate his environment, then the pragmatic justification for specialization has been given. However, there is also a sordid side to specialization. As Norbert Wiener has pointed out, A man may be a topologist or an acoustician or a coleopterist. He will be filled with the jargon of his field and will know all its literature, and all its ramifications, but, more frequently than not, he will regard the next subject as something belonging to his colleague three doors down the corridor, and will consider any interest in it on his own part as an un unwarrantable breach of privacy.1 The notions 'your field' and 'my field' carry with them two un fortunate implications. To begin with, such 'cubicle' thinking bears a disturbing resemblance to the process of severe 'inbreeding' with its accompanying tendency to loss of vigor. The damaging results of this tendency are not too serious, inasmuch as they are confined to 1 Norbert Wiener, Cybernetics, New York: John Wiley, 1948. 182</page><page sequence="2">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND SIGNIFICS the devitalization of a limited number of qualified scientists and scholars. The second implication has more serious consequences. Speciali zation becomes institutionalized. The innumerable '-ologies' provide a framework for the administrative apparatus of our institutions of learning. As is usual, the administrative structure is even more static than the conceptual hierarchies of the academicians, so that attempts on the part of non-conformists to commit 'breaches of academic privacy' are countered not only by the resentments of the 'specialists' but also by the formidable forces of administrative authority. A trend away from this atomization and towards greater integration of scientific activity is observed in the rise of bastard sciences. What are some of these hybrid disciplines and wherein lies the power of their method ? As an early example, one might cite euclidean geometry, the first cross between empirical mathematics and formal logic. Mathematics had existed in Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations merely as a description of certain experiences (measurement) and sets of rules for computation. Formal logic, as developed by Aristotle, was little more than a set of rules for making classifications. But formal logic applied to a few fundamental postulates of geometry resulted in a magnificent structure of knowledge. Another example is the cross between algebra and geometry ac complished by Descartes on November 10, 1619. The discovery of a profound correspondence reflected in a formal isomorphism between the language of algebra and that of geometry enabled mathematicians to translate discoveries made in one field into progress in another field. As is usually the case, progress made under such circumstances is 'non-additive.' Other examples are equally illuminating: mathematical physics, biological chemistry, physiological psychology, biophysics, etc. Two of these areas are quite new. One is mathematical biophysics, the other has been christened cybernetics by Norbert Wiener and his as sociates and has at this time about a decade of research behind it. These two bastard sciences should be of particular interest to the significist for two reasons. First, they bear out the principle that an integrated approach to any field of inquiry is likely to yield 'non additive* dividends. This is true, of course, of many other such cross bred disciplines. But mathematical biophysics and cybernetics have even more important implications for signifies. The understanding of the events in the nervous system and analogous systems as determined by their structure is fundamental for the understanding of abstract ly</page><page sequence="3">ANATOL RAPOPORT ion, evaluation, and communication, processes of basic importance in signifies and in semantics. In 1923 Korzybski wrote as follows: If there is to be a science of human engineering, it must be mathematical in spirit and in method and if we do not possess methods to apply mathematical thinking to humain affairs, such methods must be discovered. Can this be done? Let us say a word about what has already been accomplished in this direction. The latest researches in the foundations of mathematics, chiefly accomplished by Whitehead, Russell, Poin car?, and Keyser, have disclosed the insufficiency and fallacies of the traditional logic and have produced an internal revolution in logic and mathematics. Mathematics and logic have proved to be one; a fact from which it seems to follow that mathematics may successfully deal with non-quantitative problems in a much broader sense than was suspected to be possible. Elaborating this confidence in the mathematical method as a tool for studying man, Korzybski said in 1933: The problems of the world in 1933 are acute and immediate, overloaded with confusion, bitterness, hopelessness, and other forms of semantic disturbances. Without some means ? and in this case, scientific and physiological means ? to regulate our semantic reactions, we shall not be able to solve our problems soon enough to avoid disasters. The similarity in structure of mathematics, and our nervous system, once pointed out and applied, gives us a unique means to regulate the semantic reactions, without which it is practically impossible to analyse dispassionately and wisely the most pressing problems of im mediate importance. 2 All in all, Korzybski's conjectures (conjectures, because of the frag mentary knowledge then available of the similarity of structure between mathematics and the human nervous system) can be sum marized in a few principles. 1. Communication between human beings is possible That is to say, a language can be contructed in which the relations between events in the outside world can be symbolized in such a way that independent observers will arrive at similar symbolizations and by manipulating the symbols according to the rules of the language 2 A. Korzybski, Science and Sanity, 2nd edition, p. 273. 184</page><page sequence="4">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND SIGNIFICS will arrive at similar conclusions. Korzybski cites mathematics as an example of such a language. A generalization of mathematics is any symbolic system built on structure and order relations alone. 2. The world is knowable Any symbolization of events leads us to expect that certain things will happen. But only certain ways of symbolizing lead to predictions which are actually verified. Such self-justifying symbolizations con stitude knowledge. 3. Knowledge is the establishment of ordered structure The perception, interpretation, and evaluation of events is largely a neural process (although actually the whole organism is involved in the act of knowing). 'Knowledge' consists of an ordered sequence of neuromotor events. 4. Order determines sanity Sanity is a measure of the correspondence between the ordered struc ture of the neuro-motor events and the ordered structure of the world. For the purposes of this discussion, the third principle will be con sidered first: knowledge is the establishment of ordered structure. The naive, pre-scientific approach to the explanation of phenomena was through the invention of anthropomorphic 'agencies' which were implicitly taken to be sufficient causes. The predominant question was 'Who does it ?' not 'What is being done ?' And, of course, the nature of the questions determined the limitation of the answer. The quest for 'agencies' yielded a world peopled by river-gods and fates. The reason one cannot point to a time when 'Who does it ?' gave way to 'What is being done ?' is that in spite of the verbal dichotomy between the two kinds of questions, the change of attitude was a gradual one. Although formally modern science can be said to be entirely based on the question in the form of 'What is being done ?' yet the remnants of the 'Who does it ?' attitude are still deeply in trenched in many areas of inquiry. The agencies no longer appear in anthropomorphic garb, but they are still subjects of sentences, whose subject-predicate structure almost forces the perpetuation of the old outlook and of its limitations. The power of the new outlook is embodied in the notion of invari ance. The abstraction of cardinal number was perhaps the clearest and oldest example of this notion. As Korzybski, Russell, and others have pointed out, a tremendous intellectual revolution sprang from the revelation that a 'brace' of pheasants, a 'pair' of boots, a 'team' o? horses, 'twins,' 'couples,' and 'duets' are all instances of a particulai 185</page><page sequence="5">ANATOLRAPOPORT invariance which we have come to call the cardinal number 'two.' Basically the same kind of revelation underlies the law of gravity. To Newton falling bodies, tides, and the motions of the moon also ap peared as instances of an invariance. It is this novel outlook which enabled him to formulate the famous inverse square law. It is important to note that one cannot point at the 'two-ness' of two cows. Nor can one mine gravity. But it is precisely these 'intang ibles' which have proved most useful in the business of scientific map-making. In counting groups of cows and stars we must com pletely disregard the 'cowness' and the 'starness' of the groups, just as we disregard the 'nature' of the objects subject to gravitational forces in computing the effects of such forces. The things that do matter are not the 'nature' of the objects but the relations between them. Here knowledge has been reduced to structure and order. Mathematical biophysics and cybernetics are programs of research aimed at the discovery of the significant invariants underlying the functioning of the nervous system. Rashevsky, for example, who may be considered the founder of mathematical biophysics, considers the central nervous system as an 'aggregate of a very large number of irritable elements, which all can be divided into two groups: exciting and inhibiting' and proposes 'a systematic study of the simplest cases of interaction which may occur in such an aggregate.' As has been pointed out, the problem of describing the world is a relation-seeking problem. The relations form a structure and the pro perties of this structure are then the properties of the world. Know ledge means knowledge of structure. This is the epistemological aspect of the problem. But we recognize another aspect, namely, the psysiolog ical one. And this aspect also revolves about structure, namely, the structure of the nervous system. In fact we view sanity as a measure of the correspondence between the two structures (see Principle 4 above). It is most important to remember that the word 'structure' as used here refers to a spatio-temporal configuration of events and not merely to the relative position of objects in space or to the connect ions between the neural elements. If this extension of the meaning of structure from spatial to spatio-temporal is not made, then the objections of the Gestaltists, Freudians, etc. to what they believe to be the behaviorirt point of view are certainly justified. The early behaviorist view that behavior can be explained in terms of the spatial relations between the neural components of an organism rested on the tacit assumption that during an appreciable interval of time the nervous system of an organism is in a certain 'state' which completely determines what stimulus elicits what response. The neurological 186</page><page sequence="6">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND SIGNIFICS basis of his assumption, as pointed out by F. S. C. Northop, was the hypothesis that 'neurons are always put together in the nervous system to form a path in or through the nervous system which is non-circular.' This oversimplified notion is untenable in the light of recent neu rological findings, and of the theoretical investigations of the central nervous system by the mathematical biophysicists. The neurophysiologists (chiefly Lorente de No, Cannon, and Rosen blueth) have called attention to the importance of circular paths (reverberating chains of neurons) in the central nervous system. On the other hand Rashevsky has shown by constructing models how circular paths may account for conditioning and gestalt phenomena, while McCulloch, Pitts, Householder, and Landahl have laid the foundations for the mathematical treatment of the spatio-temporal structure of neural nets. This is only one example of how the broad principles of non-aris totelian methodology find a direct counterpart in the recent extension of the physico-mathematical method to psycho-physiology. The work is now rapidly progressing. The Boolean algebra methods of McCul loch and Pitts are being extended to a statistical (probabilistic) form ulation, which appears as a generalization of behaviorist views. It was our hope that such a generalization would be found and would provide an opportunity for constructing a science of man adequate for our times. It is the task of the mathematical bio-physicists actually to construct such a science. At the time Korzybski presented the above-mentioned paper, he could report no more of this task (the physico-mathematical method applied to a science of man) than the work of Whitehead, Russell, Poincar?, and Keyser, who had shown the similarity of structure between logic and mathematics. To-day, a quarter of a century later, we can report considerably more. To begin with, the physiological aspect of the problem had been outlined by Korzybski himself in Science and Sanity. And as Science and Sanity was being written, isolated investigators were already at work, laying the foundations of a physico-mathematical theory of the nervous system. We have already mentioned Rashevsky and his group, now active at the University of Chicago. Work along similar lines has been carried out by Blair (Rochester, N.Y.), Hill (England), Mon nier (France), Schaefer (Germany) and others. The very tools of re search which these workers employed (the physico-mathematical method) enabled them to emphasize the important aspects of the problem, namely, invariants rather than agencies. To be sure, the point of view has not been left unchallenged. It 187</page><page sequence="7">ANATOL RAPOPORT has been pointed out that the picture of the nervous system as pre sented, for example, in Rashevsky's Mathematical Biophysics, is so abstract as to lose contact with 'reality.' It is maintained that neurons are not simply 'elements,' that the processes underlying their activity are enormously complex, that perhaps they are not even amenable to description in physico-chemical terms, etc. A thorough analysis of these objections is given in the introduction to Rashevsky's book. One can see from his arguments that he is semantically sophisticated. For the sake of continuity, however, we shall briefly reproduce them here. The objection that a formulation deals with 'abstractions' and not 'realities' is a vacuous one, because there is no such thing as a de scription of 'concrete reality'. No matter how minutely one were to describ? a 'neuron' or the sequence of events associated with the interaction of neurons, one would not be describing 'reality' but only selecting certain aspects of it considered pertinent to the problem at hand, that is, abstracting. The question is, therefore, not wether ab stractions as such are justifiable (they cannot be escaped), but which abstractions are useful. Useful for what? Useful for discovering re lations to be used in constructing theories from which other relations can be predicted. The verification of predictions implied in the theories is, of course, the test of their truth. But even if the predictions fail to be realized, the framework of the theory is often such that the way to refinement and correction becomes evident and thus progress in the search for truth can be realized. Precisely this is the raison d'?re of the abstractions made in physics. Every physicist knows that molecules are not per fectly elastic, tiny billiard balls, as they were assumed to be in the first formulations of the kinetic theory of gases. Hence the physicists were not surprised to see that experimental results often deviated significantly from their predictions. But once the 'classical' kinetic theory was developed, ways of introducing corrections suggested themselves and a steady approach to truth became possible. No phy sicist believes in the existence (except verbally) of 'point masses,' 'rigid bodies,' or 'continuous fluids.' Yet descriptions of events in terms of derived relations between such fictions is what constitutes physics. The physicist is at ease using abstractions, because he knows that abstraction is not reality, the word is not the thing. The value of the abstractions made in mathematical biology should be judged by the effective use to which they can be put. On the basis of Rashevsky's picture of the nervous system, it has been possible to describe quantitatively such relations as reaction time as a function of stimulus intensity; reaction time as a function of the interval 188</page><page sequence="8">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND SIGNIFICS between a preparatory 'warning' and the stimulus; acuity of discrimin ation as a function of the magnitude of the stimulus, and many other relations. The approach has also been extremely useful in suggesting 'models' to account for a wide variety of 'psychological' phenomena, such as conditioned reflexes, error elimination (as observed in maze learning), logical 'thinking,' visual perception and esthetics, and some psychotic states. Perhaps the most remarkable results of this method are to be found in the area dealing with the so-called 'gestalt phenomena.' These, as will be recalled, consist in the ability of nervous systems to appreciate a great many different stimuli as instances of 'the same thing,' that is, to recognize invariance. When a square is presented to us in various positions, we still recognize it as a square ? in other words, we respond to it always in the same way although the retinal elements involved are quite different each time. Again the square may be of any color, or of the same color but of different brightness. It may be drawn in black lines on a white background or in white lines on a black background. It is still recognized as a square. Rashevsky then proceeds to describe a model by means of which a 'neural network' can solve this problem of recognition. Thus the structure of an abstracting system must be considered to have been given. In the meantime, other workers, studying problems connected with the construction of electronic computers and calculating machines from the point of view of invariances involved in such devices (that is, disregarding the fact that the elements were vacuum tubes, resis tors, coils, wheels, etc.) formulated analogous theories. The two programs of research, a mathematical theory of the ner vous system on the one hand and the development of electronic computers on the other, proceeded along parallel lines. As can be readily surmised, such remarkable parallelism could not long remain unnoticed. Workers from both fields soon found themselves talking to each other in a language which was a curious mixture of psycho physiology (neurons, synapses, refractory periods, threshold, etc.) and electronics (feedbacks, vacuum tubes, amplifiers, transformers, etc.). The mathematics, however, was devoid of such specialized termino logy. Its abstractions (integrals, differentials, matrices, series, etc.) 189</page><page sequence="9">ANATOL RAPOPORT were disdainfully indifferent of the uses to which they were put. They reflected the basic invariances common to both sets of phenomena. It is said that Chinese from different provinces, unable to com municate through spoken language, nevertheless can make them selves adequately understood through writing. Psycho-physiologists and communication engineers found themselves in a similar situation. Although the 'pronunciations' of their respective symbols were widely different, yet the symbols themselves (that is the mathematical ex pressions) were quite similar. Thus another border area arose, concerned with problems com mon to communication engineering and psycho-physiology. Norbert Wiener has recently dubbed it cybernetics, a term from the Greek word for governor, an allusion to the principle of negative feedback. The wealth of ideas outlined in Cybernetics (New York: John Wiley &amp;: Sons, 1948) makes it a book of enormous interest to the psycho-linguist, especially if he is mathematically trained. As an illu stration of the close connection between his area of study and cyber netics, we shall describe one of the topics discussed by Wiener, namely, the relation between 'amount of information' and entropy. In thermodynamics there exists a quantitative definition of order, or rather a quantitative definition of chaos, namely, entropy, so that a natural quantitative definition of order suggests itself, namely, the negative of entropy. Although an adequate discussion of the entropy concept is beyond the scope of this article, nevertheless an attempt will be made to illustrate the concept by an elementary example. Arrange a deck of cards according to suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Note that the first twenty-six cards are all red. Now shuffle the deck thoroughly. Examine the first twenty-six cards. Ap proximately half of them will be red and the other half black. Now no matter how long you keep schuffling, if you examine the first twenty-six cards now and then, the overwhelming chances are that you will find the same situation: approximately half red, half black. It is practically impossible to bring the cards back into their original order by shuffling. We say that the entropy of the deck has increased. This, indeed, is the essence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which implies that all natural processes tend to proceed in the direc tion of increased entropy (greater chaos or less order). Two different gases brought into contact will soon diffuse into each other because of the random motions of the molecules, and the likelihood that they will ever be found again unmixed is vanishingly small. Heat flows from bodies of higher temperature to those at lower temperature. It 190</page><page sequence="10">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND SIGNIFICS is shown by consideration of the molecular structure of bodies that this also implies an increase of chaos. There are instances, however, where opposite processes seem to occur. The most obvious of these are those where some 'intelligence' seems to interfere. For example, we can take a well shuffled deck of cards and shortly bring it back to its factory order. This illustration is not meant as an example contradicting the Second Law of Ther modynamics inasmuch as the system considered is not isolated. It is brought out merely to show that the processes where an 'intelligence' interferes may seem to tend toward decreased entropy whereas they tend toward greater entropy when 'left to themselves.' Involved in such an ordering is a sequence of decisions (this card is black; this card is red, etc.). Presumably the decisions are events in the nervous system of some organism or in some 'servo-mechanism,' to use the terminology of communications engineers. It has been conjectured that such decisions and life processes in general are somehow con nected with regions where a marked lowering of entropy is taking place. Figuratively speaking, life has been compared to a process which attempts to stem the ever-onrushing tide of chaos. To quote Schroedinger: What an organism feeds upon is negative entropy. Or, to put it less paradoxically, the essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in freeing itself from all the entropy it cannot help producing while alive.3 To be sure, a hard-hearded, 'realistic' scientist may dismiss such speculations as poetic romanticising, irrelevant to scientific procedure. This austere attitude is, no doubt, a reflection of the exacting standards of modern scientific rigor. Yet let us remember that before a child learns to talk, he must babble. Towards More Complex Organization The early formulations of significists and semanticists, like those of any dynamic Weltanschauung, were naturally full of conjectures. 3 E. Schroedinger, What Is Life? Compar this definition with Goethe's Mephistopheles' definition of himself as the antithesis of the creative principle: I am the Spirit that Denies And justly so: for all things, from the Void Called forth, deserve to be destroyed. T were better, then, were naught created. and his admission of failure: How many have I made away withl Yet ever circulates a newer, fresher blood. It makes me furious, such things beholding: From Water, Earth, and Air unfolding, A thousand germs break forth and grow.... 191</page><page sequence="11">ANATOL RAPOPORT The recent investigations of mathematical biophysics and now of cybernetics give ample testimony to the fertility of at least some of those conjectures. One of them is the notion of an intimate connection between knowledge and ordered structure. Wiener has succeeded in formul ating this connection mathematically. From a very natural definition of 'amount of information,' Wiener derives a formal mathematical isomorphism between it and the negative of entropy, which, as has been pointed out, can be taken to be the measure of order. This for mulation immediately suggests relations between ordered systems and the dynamics of knowing. In deed, so remarkable is the parallelism between ordered systems of an 'inorganic' nature and what had long been commonly regarded as 'mental phenomena,' that the remarks of Butler's Philosopher lose their sardonic character and seem to attain a prophetic significance.4 Finally, the application of statistical methods to two other import ant classes of biological problems must be mentioned, namely, the evolution and the developmental embryology of nervous systems. If one takes the point of view that the developmental potential of an organism resides in the structure of its neural net, an obvious quest ion to ask is how this neural net comes into being. We have already shown how cybernetics seeks to establish a formal mathematical relation between 'amount of information' and 'amount of order.' Translated into psycho-physiological terms, the relation becomes one between 'intelligence' and 'degree of organization'. The evidence of evolution indicates that, at least along certain lines, the development of organisms has proceeded in the direction of more complex organization of the nervous system. The authors of the present article have attempted to formulate mathematically the process of embryological development of a neural net by em ploying statistical and stochastic methods. Essentially the problem is this: the models of neural nets which Rashevsky, Landahl, Culbertson, McCiUlloch, Householder, Pitts, and others constructed to account for various psychological phenomena, contain many frequently recurring 'units of structure,' such as cycles, convergences, divergences, cross-connections, etc. How do such struc tures arise? What variations can be expected between individuals, species, genera, classes, etc.? What are the invariances associated with the process of their development? In vertebrates, the basic features of the process can be described as follows: Certain regions of the embryonic ectodermal tissue give rise 4 Cf. Samuel Butler, Erehwhon. 192</page><page sequence="12">MATHEMATICAL BIOPHYSICS, CYBERNETICS AND SIGNIFICS to specialized cells called neuroblasts. In the course of development, each neuroblast grows protuberances (axones and dendrites) which ultimately form connections (synapses) with the dendrites and axones of other neuroblasts. Such a maze of connected neurons (adult neuro blasts) is referred to as a neural net. Certain neurophysiologists, notably P. A. Weiss, have studied the factors influencing the course of such development. In particular they have sought to determine the forces influencing the direction of growth of the axones and dendrites and the specific affinities determining the patterns which are formed by the connections. In line with this view, the authors have asked the following quest ion. Given an initial distribution of developing neuroblasts, what can be said about the probability of certain patterns arising in the absence of any organising influences? In the process of the mathematical for mulation of this problem, certain parameters arise, whose variations are a measure of the 'amounts of order' of the system. Hence the growth-determining factors studied by Weiss may be associated with these parameters and integrated into a mathematical theory of neural organization. SUMMARY It remains to summarize the contributions which each of the three disciplines discussed here is making toward the development of a science of man. Signifies makes a study of the effects on human behavior of the linguistic aspects of the evaluative process, the most distinctly human aspect of the behavior of the human organism. Mathematical Biophysics seeks to describe the events associated with evaluative processes in physico-mathematical terms. Cybernetics is discovering important invariants common to these processes and others, particularly those observed in man-made machines and in situations which lend them selves to description in thermo-dynamic or statistical (order ? chaos) terms.</page></plain_text>
