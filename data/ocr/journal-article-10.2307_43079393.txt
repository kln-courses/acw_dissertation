<plain_text><page sequence="1">274 Notes on Nintur Thorkild Jacobsen - Cambridge, Mass. The invitation to contribute to this volume in honour of Professor Ignace Gelb called for a brief paper dealing with method, specifically with the pheno- menological method, as it applies to the study of Ancient Mesopotamian reli- gion. Seeking to comply as nearly as possible with this request we have chosen, since a fulldress discussion of method would hardly be feasible in the space available 1t merely to restate briefly what to us appears as the fundamental methodological distinctions, and then to illustrate and comment on - subjec- tively and without systematic intent - some of the further problems that arise as one approaches a group of related data in these terms. We have chosen to take a cursory look at some of the names, epithets, and belongings of the An- cient Mesopotamian goddess Nintur that are mentioned in Gudea's Statue A. We lay no claim to completeness. Nor do we attempt in dealing with them to furnish anything resembling a rounded study of the divine figure; these are only random notes looking toward such an undertaking. Fundamental Distinctions The methodological distinctions that seem to us basic for a rewarding study of religion we have on previous occasions stated as follows: 1. The Ground of Religion and the Study of Religion "Basic to all religion, formal or otherwise, is a unique experience which with a term coined by Rudolph Otto, is usually called the 'numinous' experi- ence. Otto has analyzed it as the experience of a Mysterium Tremendum et Fas- cinosum, a confrontation with the 'Wholly Other', outside normal experience and indescribable in terms of normal experience, terrifying, ranging from sheer demonic dread through awe to sublime majesty, and fascinating, with irresist- ible attraction, demanding unconditional allegiance. It is the human response to this experience in thought (mythology and theology) and action (cult) which constitutes religion, and it is with the manifold forms which the response takes that the study of religion properly concerns itself. The aim of such study must be, beyond all, to understand and to interpret the various religious 1 The interested reader will find such a discussion in G. van der Leeuw, Religion in Essence and Manifestation (Gloucester, Mass. 1967), chapters 107- 110, vol. II p. 671-695.</page><page sequence="2">Notes on Nintur 275 forms as response, as ultimately meaningful in relation to the underlying numi- nous experience only" 2. 2. The Religious Metaphor Since the Numinous is altogether other, not of this world, it cannot be described; for all available terms are based on experience in this world and so do not apply. At most it is possible to evoke the response of the numinous experience by analogy, in metaphors 3. Because of this, the particular meta- phors which a given culture or cultural period lights upon as especially meaning- ful and effective are of central interest, for they represent its way of conveying its understanding of the Numinous and forms a bridge from immediate expe- rience in the religiously gifted to mediate experience in the great masses, and are also the means by which one generation hands on its religious insights to the next. As such metaphors must count names, forms and functions of the gods, even the term god itself; and they are presumed in, and underlie, the building of temples and the performing of rituals. In dealing with religious metaphors the fact that they are metaphors should not be forgotten, they are Janus-faced. On the one hand they are firmly grounded in experience of this world as conditioned by the culture out of which they come, and must first be understood in those terms. On the other, their function is precisely to point beyond themselves to something not of this world. They can serve, Janus-like, as doors to ultimate understanding only if that is kept in mind. 3. The Secular Grounding of the Metaphor The religious metaphor is taken from culturally conditioned, culturally determined, experience and so must first of all be understood in terms of func- tion within that culture 4. In the case of Ancient Mesopotamian religion, the data for which are conditioned by a culture so far from us in time and place, such understanding is no easy matter. There is, however, only one road toward it: continued study seeking to grasp the culture and its value organically and as a whole, trusting to insights that light up and clarify beyond what one expected, checking and rechecking in empathy against new data, new possibilities as 2 "Formative Tendencies in Sumerian Religion", in The Bible and the Ancient Near East : Essays in Honor of William Foxwell Albright, ed.

It is not quite clear to us, however, why, as stated just before the passage here quoted, a study of the resurrection of Tammuz (arranged for by Inanna at the end of the Myth of Inanna's Descent) or of Sumerian beliefs in afterlife (described in detail in the ¡story Gilgamesh, Knkidu, and the Nether World) must be fruitless. Since a culture is an organic whole, a system, it would seem to us that one should try to understand it as a whole, not in fragments, and that no cultural element should be deliberately neglected.</page><page sequence="3">276 T.

Nur durch hingebendes versenken in diese geistesspuren entschwun- dener zeit, also durch philologische arbeit vermögen wir uns zum nachempfinden zu erziehen; dann können allmählich verwandte saiten in uns mit schwingen und klingen, und wir entdecken im eignen bewusst- sein die fäden, die altes und neues verbinden.

Bs wäre übel mit menschlicher Wissenschaft bestellt, wenn wer im einzelnen forscht fesseln trüge, die ihm vervehrten zum ganzen zu streben. Je tiefer man gräbt, desto mehr wird man durch allgemeinere erkenntnisse belohnt 6. 4. The Sacred Pointing of the Metaphors The other side of the metaphor, its function of pointing to, and evoking, numinous experience is clearly dependent for its realization both on the degree to which the student is able to enter with valid empathy into the culture to which it belongs, and on the degree to which he is capable generally of religious response - in fine on his openness to symbolization other than his own. To state that the student of religion needs must be capable of religious sensitivity is nothing very extraordinary, it is not different from saying that a student of literature must be capable of literary sensitivity, of sensing e. g., what is poetry and what is not poetry; or that a student of art must be capable of sensitivity to art. In the study of religion it means specifically that one is willing to draw on one's own religious experience to understand sympatheti- cally forms that may at first seem empty or even repellent, while at the same time guarding against reading into the data things that are not there. A characteristic feature of the oldest Mesopotamian metaphors is what we have termed "intransiti vity ' ' 7. The Ancient Mesopotamian tended, imme- diately and unreflectedly, to see a numinous experience as a revelation of pow- er to, and in, a dominant phenomenon of the situation of the experience. The power was, so to speak, the numinous élan vital of the phenomenon, a will in it to be and thrive in its particular form and manner. Only with the advent of the ruler metaphor did a new "transitivity" of certain gods appear: Will to social justice and morality, will and power to victory over enemy armies etc. In seeking to understand the pointing of such situationally conditioned religious metaphors it is obviously of help to seek to clarify to oneself what was the situation, in nature or society, from which the metaphor was taken. As we have stated earlier in dealing with the figure of Dumuzi: "We must try 5 A. Leo Oppenheim, Ancient Mesopotamia (Chicago 1964) contains a chapter entitled "Why a 'Mesopotamian Religion' should not be Written" in which these difficulties are stressed to the point of defeatism. Oppenheim gives as reasons: "the nature of the available evidence, and the problem of com- prehension across the barriers of conceptual conditioning" (op. cit., p. 172) but these same reasons for giving up could with equal right be applied to any other aspect of Ancient Mesopotamian civilization and even to any attempt at making a dictionary. If the early decipherers, who faced far greater difficul- ties, had let themselves be thus easily discouraged, cuneiform would still be a closed book. 6 Hermann Usener, Götternamen (Bonn 1896), p. vii. 7 In "Toward the Image of Tammuz", History of Religions 1 (1961) 190- 192 = TIT, p. 74-76.</page><page sequence="4">Notes on Nintur 277 to identify the concrete loci in the external world in which a feeling of being in the presence of divine power of that particular kind, suggestive of that parti- cular symbolization, may naturally have arisen. For it is only there that we may hope to find common ground in reality with the myth. Once we have iden- tified the loci in the external world in which the particular experience that is symbolized and given form in the god came to the Ancients, we can try, out of our own human experience to recapture in sympathetic understanding such value and truth as that symbolization may possess as an expression of the 'un- changing human heart' " 8. Guiding for understanding and evaluation must always be the fact that in so far as data are religious data they reflect, directly or indirectly, numinous experience. Nintur The Name Nintur Statue A of Gudea, the divine names, epithets etc. of which we wish to consider, was destined for a Temple built for a goddess - a very well known one - who is called by two different names. Once she is Ninhursaga(k) and once Nintur 9.

A former pupil, Mr. B. Alster, has taken exception to this statement in his study Dumuzi's Dream (Copenhagen 1972) p. 10-12. He says (p. 12): "As a result of the emotion- al approach which is especially apparent in the final statement of the quota- tion above, that myths contain certain values which may be grasped by the sympathetic understanding, the evidence of the different sources is not eval- uated systematically in Th. Jacobsen's study". It is not clear to us why sym- pathetic understanding must act to preclude systematic evaluation of sources - we should have thought, rather, it might have helped - and we find Alster's frowning on sympathetic understanding and unwillingness to allow that an- cient materials might be bearers of values oddly conformable with the method- ology recommended, not on best authority, to the student in Faust: "Wer will was Lebendigs erkennen und beschreiben, / Sucht erst den Geist heraus zu trei- ben, / Dann hat er die Teile in seiner Hand, / Fehlt leider! nur das gei- stige Band". 9 In favor of reading d N i n -Tu as dNin-tur5 is the gloss t ú r in An :Anum, CT XXIV pl. 12.16 and writings showing the final -r such as [ d ] [ N ] in -Tu- r e , TRS 12.24 and d N i n -Tu- r a (anticipatory genitive), PBS V no 1. i. 39; also A d a b k 1 -ur u-d N i n-TU-r a-t a Falkenstein, ZA 55 p. 23 note 80 etc. See also Â.

"sprouted forth") with the city, the mother of all children, his mistress, did Gudea, ruler of Lagash, build her temple in the city Girsu (ht. "her Girsu- city -house "). Her holy (copper) water pail he fashioned for her. Her august queenly seat he fashioned for her, and brought it in for her in her august temple. From the highlands (of) Magan he brought down dolerite and shaped (lit. "gave birth to") it into his statue. "The queen (entitled) to make decisions in (all) heaven and earth, Nintur, mother of the gods, has lengthened the life of Gudea, the man (in charge) of building the temple" he named it for her and brought it in for her into the Temple. Taking the information here given as a starting point for trying to understand the character of the goddess to whom the statue was dedicated we may begin 11 For dub as graphic variant of urudu in older time see CAD E p. 321 s. v. eru A quoting A 111/5:11.</page><page sequence="6">Notes on Nintur 279 by considering the second of the two names used for her, Nintur. This name, it may be noted first of all, is written with a sign tur5 (Tu) which, as shown by its earlier forms12, was originally the picture of a reed-hut with a tall decora- tive spar or spire, similar to the reed-huts pictured in early representations of sheepfolds and cowpens 13 . Such a picture also underlies another sign with value tur, the sign tùr, "cowpen" (Akk. tarbāsu)u, and the difference between this sign and t u r 5 in their original forms is so slight - in tùr the spar points straight up, in t u r 6 it tilts - that it is tempting to assume that they were originally mere orthographic variants of a single original sign picturing the hut of a cowpen and representing the Sumerian word tur "cowpen". In a study of the huts shown in early representations of sheepfolds and cowpens P. Delougaz has called attention to the small and weak lambs or calves that are typically shown emerging from them, and he argues convincingly that they are meant to represent newborn animals coming out of a hut to which the mother animals were brought to give them needed protection and help in lambing or calving 15 . The suggested function of the hut in fold and pen as a "birth-hut", a shel- ter for the pregnant ewes and cows when about to give birth and, presumably, a shelter also for animals needing protection and care because of sickness, goes far to explain and unify the values and meaning attested for the sign tur5 (Tu). When read t u r 5 it can denote "baby" (šerrum), "weak" (lau), "young" (sehrum), "delicate" (laků), and "goat-kid" (laliu); when read dú it means "to shape", "construct" (banû) and "to give birth" (walãdu), while, signifi- cantly, when read durx it denotes "illness" (mur su), "ill" (marsu), "to fall ill" (marāsu), and "to distress" (murrusu) 16. The word for the birth-hut in the cowpen, tur, was also used metaphor- ically to designate the organ which in a woman's body fulfilled a similar func- tion, the womb. This metaphorical use is strikingly attested to in an incanta- tion to aid childbirth 17 which begins: munus-e é -t ùr-amas-kù-ga im-da-an-zé-eb- b a - n a é-dú-ud-gál é - t ù r - a m a š - k ù - g a im-da-an- ze-eb-ba-na n u m u n - z i -n a m - 1 ú - u x - r k a 1 šá-ga ba-ni-in-ri e e 4 - š à - g e - r i - a k a - k é š k i - s i - d u lú-ra dumu sunišu-mu munus-e ù-làl-e z ú r z u i - b i - b í - i n g u - u b - g u b šá-gal-da bi-in-gur 12 See A.

This woman tasted the honeysweet pasturage and from the fodder she grew thick, Tasted the honeysweet pasturage the thing she loves, and from the fodder she grew thick This woman - it is verily her month, her day. The metaphorical use of the word for birth-hut to denote uterus, womb, here met with helps to clarify the etymology of the usual Sumerian word for "womb", "uterus", which was written sag4-tùr and was borrowed into Akkadian as Šassūrum "womb". It apparently constitutes a partitive apposi- tion 18 and denotes "the birth-hut ( t ù r ) of the insides/innards ( š a g 4 )". Also the use of the sign TÙR with inscribed munus "woman" to denote the word arhuš "womb", "compassion", thus becomes clear. Returning, then, to the sign t u r 5 (Tu) and its use in the name Nintur, we may assume an original meaning "Lady ( n i n ) Birth-hut ( t u r 5)" with a potential metaphorical use also for "Lady ( n i n ) Womb ( t u r 5 )". This latter meaning for the name is directly attested by the equations given in the god-list An :Anum19 dNin( !)-tur5 20: ¿Šassūrum (šá-Tur) dŠag4-túr : and is further confirmed by the Akkadian name for the goddess, Šassūrum , used e. g., in the Atra-hasīs myth21. With the philological evidence agrees the archaeological testimony. It has long been realized that a curious omega-shaped (ÍÍ) emblem found on boundary stones and on Old- Babylonian clay plaques is an emblem of Nintur/ Ninhursaga. In a detailed study of this emblem Henri Frankfort was able to demonstrate, by adducing Egyptian parallels, that it constituted a schematic 18 On this type of noun formation see Poebel, ZA 37 (1927) 248. 19 KA V 64 ovb i. 18-19 (correct to rev. ii. 18-19) cf. the related entries CT XXIV pl. 26 obv. ii 135, CT XXV pl. 30 K 2109 i. 12 and MSL IV, p. 6. 35. 20 Thus emend with Landsberger MSL IV, p. 6 note to 1. 35, and restore with him CT XXIV pl. 26.25 as dNin!-túr:Ša-su-ru [dšá-tur: MIN MIN]. 21 See W.

Since the divine emblems of Ancient Meso- potamia may generally be considered survivals of older, nonanthropomorph forms of the deities they belong to 23 Nintur was probably at one time envis- aged under the form of a cow's uterus, the organ in and of which she was the power. The goddess then, would seem to be in essence numinous power in and behind the reproductive process of the cow. That power had its locus in the birth-hut of the cowpen and so became symbolized by it. More specifically yet, it resided in the reproductive organ, the uterus, of the cow for which, meta- phorically, the birth-hut came to serve, as "birth-hut of the insides". It was, as the herdsman well knew, a power for good, a power vitally im- portant to him and his survival. But it was not only and always that, occa- sionally instead of a live well-made calf it might decide to produce a monstrous stillborn young. As the great hymn to Enlil says24: kur-gal d E n - 1 í 1 - d a nu-me-a d N i n - t u r 5 nu-ug5-ge sag-giš nu-ra-ra áb-e é-tùr-ra amar-bi nu-šub-bé u8 amaš-bi-a sila4-gá-gig nu-è Without (warrant of) the great mountain, Enlil, Nintur could not let die, could not slay, The cow would not lose its calf in the cattlepen, The ewe not bring forth a premature lamb in its sheepfold. It was a power not to be taken for granted. Having thus tentatively located the concrete locus in the external world "the hut for calving in the cowpen", in which a feeling of being in the presence of divine power such as is characteristic of Nintur may naturally have arisen, we may consider next the other name used for her by Gudea, that of Ninhursaga. The Name Ninhursaga The name Ninhursaga is etymologically transparent; it means "The Lady of the Foothills". Hursag, the term which we have translated "Foothills", has actually a somewhat wider application. It can denote the foothills and near mountain ranges of the Iranian highlands in the East, but also the stony Arabian desert bordering the alluvium of Southern Mesopotamia in the west. Basically, therefore, it would seem to denote "stony ground", "rock" 26. 22 H. Frankfort, "A Note on the Lady of Birth", J NES 3 (1944) 198 ff. cf.

Falkenstein, Sumerische Götterlieder I (Heidelberg 1959), p. 17: lines 123-126. 26 This is suggested by the fact that Abiak on the Ab-gal ( apkallatu ) canal in the extreme west of the Mesopotamian alluvial bordered on the hur- sag according to the text giving borders fixed by Ur-Nammu published by F.

Jacobsen As "the Lady of the Foothills" Ninhursaga may be assumed to be the nu- men of rocky or hilly land, particularly perhaps of the eastern near ranges, and this is confirmed by the passage Gudea Cyl. B xxii (Frgm. S ii 3-5) 26 in which the parentage of her son, the power in the yearly floods Ninurta/Ningirsu, is given thus: dNin-rgírn-[su]e4-zi-dKn-l[íl-lá] Hur-sag-e dú-da in a š - 1 u 1 i m - e ga-zi-gu7-a Ningirsu, rightful semen of Enlil, born by Hursag (the foothills) 27 suckled right with milk by deer Here Hursag, the personified "Foothills" serves as name for the numinous power in them, without any anthropomorph honorary epithet n i n - "Lady" 28, just as the early designation of Nin-tur5 was simply T u r 5 "birth-hut". As numen of the rocky wilds the wildlife belonged to her. In the passage just cited her son is suckled by deer and correspondingly Gudea speaks of deer as belonging to "the mother of Ningirsu" when he appoints a divine "shepherd of deer" called "Lord deer" to care for them in the Temple he built for Ningir- su (Cyl.

In the region where we must locate Abiak no mountains, only the stony Arabian plateau, can come into consideration. 26 TCL VIII pl.

True lord, seminal water emitted by the 'Great Mountain' (Enlil)". The reference is to the red waters of the flood as they come down the mountain tributaries. 28 Similarly the "Disputation Between Winter and Summer" 11. 11-16 tells how Enlil in the shape of a bull copulated with Hur-sag engendering Summer and Winter to whom she subsequently gave birth. Here too there is no n i n and no divine determinative before her name, she is just Hur-sag. We owe knowledge of this episode to M. Civil who generously placed his MS. edition of the Disputation at our disposal. 29 Note also that according to Cyl B vi 4-7 deer's milk formed part of the breakfast with which Gudea woke up Ningirsu on his first morning in the new built temple. Note also the panel from the Ninhursaga Temple at Al Obeid showing Ningirsu in his older form as Imdugud with stags. Frankfort finely comments on it in his The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient (Harmonds- worth, Middlesex 1956), p. 30: "It shows in the centre the lion-headed eagle Imdugud, gripping a stag with either claw. The gesture does not represent aggression but affinity: the same deity is symbolized by bird and deer". Wheth- er in the light of these connections the stereotype phrase in royal titles g a - zi-gu7-a dNin-hur-sag-ga-ka "suckled right with milk by Ninhursaga" should be understood as referring to deer's milk is possible, but hardly provable.</page><page sequence="10">Notes on Nintur 283 Also other wild animals appear as Ninhursaga's children.

But she knows very well that it is in vain, her donkey-stallion has perished in the wilds and she bitterly blames the numen of the wilderness, her mother Ninhursaga 35 : To whom should I compare her? To whom should I compare her? I, to whom should I compare her? My mother let my (only) one die! - I, to whom should I compare her? My mother who bore me, Ninhursaga - My mother let it die! - I, to whom should I compare her? To the bitch, that has no motherly compassion, let me compare her! Lisina, out of her grief sits alone. As to the earliest external form or forms under which Ninhursaga was envisaged we are as yet largely in the dark. The form of the deer might be a possibility, that of the cow likewise, the latter was perhaps assumed for the Hursag in the introduction to the Dispute between Summer and Winter 38 . In Ninhursaga, then, the character of the wilderness of foothills and stony desert is reflected: the power in it to produce wildlife in all its many-fold abun- dance, but also its power to starve and kill, imperiling animals and humans alike if they stray into its barren pathless regions. 34 UET VI2 144 obv. 8-14 cf. for restorations ibid. 25-27. 35 UET VI2 144 obv. 28-33. 36 See above note 28.</page><page sequence="12">Notes on Nintur 285 All of this is very different from what we found in the case of the name Nintur. There the locus in the external world where a feeling of being in the presence of divine power of that particular kind appeared to be the birth-hut in the cowpen of the domestic herd; here the locus of confrontation would seem to be the wild of foothills and stony desert. We seem, thus, to be dealing with two quite differently conceptualized responses; which is of course but another way of saying that Nintur and Ninhursaga appear to be in origin two distinct and different deities, not one. Such a conclusion is, in fact very clearly borne out by our older evidence as pointed out in detail by Sjöberg 37 . In a godlist from Fara (Deimel, Schul- texte, No. 1 col. i) Nintur is listed as d T u r 5. In col. vi of the same text, as a separate deity, occurs dNin-hur-sag . From the period of Agade, some centuries later, we have an inscription of Narām-Sīn which likewise treats the two as distinct. It lists aNin-hur-sag ù âNin-turò "Ninhursaga and Nintur". Even as late as Ur III it seems possible that the distinction between them main- tained itself here and there. At least the list of offerings TCL V No. 60.53 lists items for dNin-tur5 in ii29 and such for dNin-hur-sag separately in rev. ii. 3. In the case of a list of offerings like this, however, one cannot real- ly be sure that the different listing implies different deities. They could very well stand for offerings to what was considered the same goddess worshiped under different names at different sanctuaries38. These clear indications that Nintur and Ninhursaga originally were sepa- rate, different, deities naturally raise the question of how and why they could come to be identified and to blend so thoroughly as the data from the time of Gudea and onwards indicate that they actually did 39 . We may here point first to the fact that in spite of differences the two deities had very essential features in common: both were goddesses, both were powers for animal fecundity and reproduction visualized as mother figures, 37 Sjöberg and Bergman, TH p. 72-73. It does not, though, look to us as if the Temple-Hymns treat Nintur and Ninhursaga as different. 38 The use of the Sumerian Floodstory (PBS V no. 1) - Nintur, when her relations to her offspring are presented (col. i. 3', iii. 15'), Ninhursaga when she makes decisions with An, Enlil, and Enki (col. i. 13', iii. 18') - is probably to be explained as "role-true" designations only. See below p. 295 f. 39 See below note 84 for the Gudea evidence. In Old Babylonian times and later this blending may also have affected the pictorial renderings. In the well known description of úNin-tur5 šu-ut Diģir-mah "the Ninturs of Digirmah" (F. Köcher, "Der Babylonische Gottertypentext", MIO I [Berlin 1953] 57-107 obv. iii 38'-51') the puzzling iš-tu me-sir-ri-šd ana kan-tap-pi-šá qú-li-ip-tu kîma (gim) siri (muš) a-ta-at "from her girdle to her footsoles is seen snakeskin as of a snake", which does not fit with anything else we know, may be due to misinterpretation of the traditional mountain pattern, suitable for Ninhursaga, as serpent scales. Further blending of entities and features may be involved if, as the plural form šūt might suggest the description has reference to the wombgoddesses or šassurāti identified with dNin ! - 1 u r 5 : dŠassurum (šá-Tůr) of the emended KA V 64 obv. i. 18 (See above p. 280 with notes 19 and 20). Another possible case of blending of attributes is in the much discussed clay plaque showing the goddess with symbols hanging on the wall behind her and two emaciated figures squatting on either side of her. Edith Porada who has repeatedly treated these and parallelfigures, has identified them, undoubt-</page><page sequence="13">286 T. Jacobsen and both had in their character the polarity of being not only powers for new life but at the same time also powers for killing and death. Strikingly different is actually mainly that one, Nintur, is a power for reproduction in domestic animals, the other, Ninhursaga, for reproduction in wild animals. However, since calving and lambing take place in the spring when herds and flocks are away from home seeking pasture in foothills and desert, there is an actual coa- lescence of "locus" for the two powers. The birth-hut of Nintur actually stands in the domain of Ninhursaga, and it is understandable, to say the least, that herdsmen seeing how the power for animal reproduction was not limited to their flocks but manifested itself all around them in the increase of wildlife in spring, may have felt a single power to be active whether its name be Nintur or Nin- hursaga. The Epithet Ama t( Mother" 40 In the inscription on Gudea's Statue A the goddess to whom the statue is dedicated is given the epithet ama-dumu-dumu-ne "mother of all little ones" following her name Ninhursaga, and ama digir-re-ne-ke4 "mother of the gods" following her name Nintur. The first of these epithets, "mother of all little ones" indicates that the goddess by Gudea's time had tran- scended her original limitations as a power in animal procreation, wild or tame (bovine), and had become a goddess of birth generally. That this development began early, long before Gudea, is suggested by the fact that already Mesalim calls himself son of Ninhursaga, presumably indicating that he considered her the power in, and to, his own human birth41. In itself, of course, the term ama, mother, common to both of the epi- thets of Statue A has both physical and social connotations. However, what we have already learned about the locus of manifestation of the goddess desig- nated by it, certainly suggests that the former, the physical, implications of the word here are meant to predominate. A glance at the long list of names for the goddess given in the Great Godlist and An 'Anum bears this out, for while they contain few names, if any, that can be interpreted as expressing aspects of social motherhood, they abound in names relating to aspects of physical motherhood. Of such aspects the most prominent, perhaps, is that of the gradual devel- opment of the embryo which is seen as a power in the wombgoddess to shape the formless early embryo into a distinctive, recognizable animal or human edly rightly, as symbols of death, and following a suggestion of Edzard's she has tentatively considered seeing in them representations of the demon Kubu, the power in the premature, stillborn, child. Difficult here, however, is the emaciated, clearly articulated, and rather mature bodies of the figures which do not suggest premature, stillborn, children but adults starving to death. It may therefore be worth considering whether we have here rather victims of the darker side of Ninhursaga's character which lets animals and men die from hunger when they lose their way in her wilderness domain. 40 With this section cf. Poebel, PBS IV, p. 31-34. 41 The argument is not conclusive for a goddess was apparently capable of taking appropriate shape for such occasions, see Gudea Cyl A xxiii 2 1 where Gudea, whose personal goddess was the cowgoddess Ninsuna, is told: "You are one born by a flawless cow in its (manifestation as) woman".</page><page sequence="14">Notes on Nintur 287 shape. This particular power in the goddess is often referred to in the texts. Thus a hymn to the Temple É-Hi-ZAki states42. ama d N i n - t u r 5 - n i n - u 1 u t i m - m a šag4-ki-kukkú-ga-kin-ak-e lugal-ú-dú muš-zi kés-di en-ú-dú sag-men-gá-gá šu-na i-gál Mother Nintur, mistress of shaping, Working in the innards ("heart") where darkness (reigns), - to give birth to kings - to tie on the rightful tiara to give birth to enu' s , to place crowns on (their) heads, is in her hand. A self-praise of Ur-Nammu's 43 proudly states that [dN]in-tur5-re g á - e mu-un-dím-dím-en ga- ri - in u nu-tuk Nintur fashioned me bit for bit, I have none who oppose me Hammurabi calls Nintur um-mu ba-ni-ti "my mother who áhaped me" 44 and Sennacherib, using her Akkadian name, tells us that d Be-lit-ili p1- be-lit nab-ni- ti i-na šasurri a-ga-ri-in-ni a-lit-ti-ia ki-niš ippalsa-an-ni-ma ú-sab-ba-a nab-ni-ti "Belit-ili, mistress of shaping, looked purposively at me in the womb of the mother who gave birth to me, devising my shape" 45 - to cite only a few such passages. In the list of names of the goddess in A n 'Anum this function of hers would appear to underlie such names as dKn-arhuš-di-lmdím "High priestess 'Fashioning Womb' ", dNin-di-lmdim "Lady Fashioner", dNíg-zi-gál-dím-dím-me "Fashioner (of) all things in which is breath of life", and dSa7sa-lú-ux "Creatress of man"46. In these names, it will be seen, the powers in the womb to give form have been personified in some measure though not necessarily more than is implied in the use of the honorifics en "Highpriestess" and nin "lady", "mistress", we are still dealing with powers in a human or animal organ. Rather further on the road to anthropomorphism and to the borrowing of forms from human society is a group of names in which the form-giving process in the womb is seen as analogous to the kind of shaping and fashioning that artisans do: pot- ters, bronze-casters, and carpenters. Here the goddess, as developer of the embryo, takes form as artisan. She is dNin-baharba-ha-ar "Lady potter", dTibira-kalam-ma "Bronze-caster, (caster) of the Nation", 42 Sjöberg and Bergmann, TH p. 46 lines 500-503. 43 TRS no. 12 line 25. 44 CH XLIV 73. 45 OIP I p. 117 lines 3-4. 46 The power to give shape also has its negative side, the goddess may let the young of an animal or a child be born malformed, a monster or freak, perhaps stillborn (see above page 281). This rather cruelly capricious side to the goddess is told about in the myth of Knki and Ninmah, - Ninmah is another of her many names - where she boasts of her powers to give form, she can make the shape of man good or bad at will, and she proceeds to prove her point by making human freaks.</page><page sequence="15">288 T. Jacobsen dTibira-diģir-re-e-ne "Bronze-caster, (caster) of the Gods", dNagar-nam-lú-Ux-lu "Carpenter of Mankind", dNagar-šá-ga "Carpenter of (i. e. "in") the innards (Heart/Womb)". When the process of giving shape to the embryo is complete the time for its birth is at hand. This too was a matter for the goddess. It is she who "sets birthgiving going". Already in a hymn from Abu Salabikh the Temple of Nin- tur in Kesh, sharing in her essence, is praised for such powers 47 : Kéš sig4-dú-dú é-tumuSen-tur-gùn ama d N i n - t u r 5 - z a g - m í Kesh! brick (structure) causing birthgiving, house (which is) a productive young dove - Praise be Mother Nintur! and in the great hymn in praise of this Temple we hear, in the old version from Abu Salabikh48, that dDur9 ama ( 1 ) - g a 1 dú-dú- al-gá-gá (Nin) tur, the great mother, sets birth-giving going. The corresponding passage in the later version reads 49 : d N i n - h u r - s a g - g á u š u m - g a 1 - à m šag4 i m - m i - in-dab5-( var. - ú s ) 60 dNin-tu-ra-ama-gal-la ( var. -àm) dú-dú - in u- un-gá-gá None but Ninhursaga, uniquely great, makes the innards (heart) contract (var.

The same phrase is also used of the goddess, under her name Ninmenna, in the Myth of the Creation of the Hoe 61 d N i n - m e n - n a - k e 4 dú-dú al-gá-gá Ninmenna sets birth-giving going. The name which specifically designates the goddess as setting birth-giving going would seem to be úA-ru-ru, a name which may be interpreted as "The germ loosener" 52 . The goddess, though, is not only the power to set birth-giving going, she is the power in and to all facets of the process of birth.

Here belongs probably also the name dMudki-eškeš- da "Bloodstancher" which may refer to the ceasing of bleeding after birth53. Her holy ( copper ) waterpail One of the things Gudea tells us he had made for Ninhursaga/Nintur was "her holy (copper) waterpail". What this waterpail was for, and what its relation to the goddess was, may become clearer as we consider further her various aspects. A characteristic feature of the growing dominance of anthropomorphism in Ancient Mesopotamian religion was a trend to disassociate numinous power from its original locus, from the phenomenon in which it was originally seen as immanent, and to view it instead as a professional or an official in charge of it. In the case of Ninhursaga/Nintur this tendency led, as we have seen earlier, to the use of craftsman metaphors to designate her. A far more constant such image, however, is that of the midwife; she is dŠag4-zu-digir-e-ne "The midwife of the gods" 64 and she is Šag4-zu-kalam-ma "midwife of the nation" 65. We possess a description of her office and insignia given by Inanna in the myth of Enki and World Order 56 .

Jacobsen carries on her arm her birth-chair (?)68 verily holds in (her) hand her lapis lazuli (vessel) in which the afterbirth is placed69 verily carries on her arm her holy consecrated 60 waterpail verily, she is the midwife of the nation As will be seen this listing of Nintur's professional equipment includes the very kind of pail (alai) that Gudea speaks of. Presumably it was used by mid- wives to bring, and to heat, water for rinsing blood off the mother and newborn child. Gudea is thus seeing to it that the goddess is properly equipped for her profession. The function of the midwife in Ancient Mesopotamia, and so the potentia- lities of the midwife metaphor, is rather sketchily known to us. Yet a few points stand out. Before beginning her task the midwife covered her hair with a headdress 61 which may be reflected in the name dNin-men-na "Lady of the Head- dress" for the birthgoddess. The prospective mother seems to have been placed in a birth-chair 62, but our data here are vague and unclear. It is possible that, as in modern practice, the membranes, if intact, were ruptured with a slender rod 63 . The term for the actual delivery would seem to be dumu-zi(g) pure brick" CT XXIV pl. 22. obv. i. 114. A restoration to [na4] - Tu-Tu "birthstones" suggested by Falkenstein is difficult because, as he himself noted, the term for "birthstones" is na4-ú-dú, not na4-dú-dú. 68 Reading and meaning of zubi-sìg is uncertain. It is mentioned in the myth of Enki and Ninmah where Knki tells his mother Nammu to have it put together (kés-da-ni) when she is to give birth to man. 69 With the term sila3-gar-r a-na4 za-gin-a-ni "her lapis- lázuli ..." cf.

The term would thus seem to denote "(Vessel) in which the afterbirth is placed". It is presumably a shortened form for duk-sila3-gar-ra "pot in which the afterbirth is placed" which occurs in the orthography d u k - s i- 1 a3 - g a r in SLT 32 rev. iii. 12, a precursor to Hh X (see MSL VII, p. 204, 102).

Jacobsen I assist Nintur at the place of delivery (lit. "extraction of the child") I know the propitious words pertaining to cutting the umbilical cord and determining fate. After the newborn child had been washed and anointed and the afterbirth had been disposed of 71 the midwife could put on her belt again 72, apparently no knots and restrictions were allowed during birth for their possible magical ef- fects. She then placed a brick symbolic of Nintur on the ground and surround- ed it with a ring of flour before she joined in the general merrymaking of the house to celebrate the birth 73 . Names for Nintur /Ninhursaga presenting her as the power active in these various task of the midwife are probably dšu-gal-an-zu "The expert hand" 74, referring to the actual delivery, and dNin-sag-sakar-sakar "Lady bather", referring perhaps to washing the blood off the mother and child75, while the name dLàl-hur-gal-zu "Expert knower of the 'honeycomb' " (?) 76 would appear to refer to the delivery of the afterbirth, the term "honeycomb" (?) suggested by the appearence of the placenta as a mosaic of smooth tiles. The vessel for carrying the afterbirth to where it was ultimately disposed of was mentioned in the passage from Enki and World Or- der quoted above 77 . The silence which the goddess imposes upon the birth help- ers so that no incautious word may have effects on the fate of the child conceiv- ably underlies her name dNin-sig5-sig5 "Lady silencer" 78. The mid- wife's task of speaking propitious words while cutting the umbilical cord and thus determining a good fate for the child was referred to in the line from the Manungal hymn quoted above where Manungal says "I know the propitious words pertaining to cutting the umbilical cord and determining fate". It seems likely that it underlies names such as dNin-nam-tar-tar-re "Lady (entitled) to determine fates"79, dNin-ka-aš-bar-ra "Lady of Decision-making" 80 and dNin-ka-as-bar-an-ki "Decision-making 71 See note 58 above. 72 Lambert and Millard, Atra-hasîs, p. 62 line 286. 73 Op. cit. p. 62 lines 288-290 bi-it qa-di-iŠ-ti in line 290 is the house of the "woman in confinement".

"Her august queenly seat" The second votive offering mentioned by Gudea, "her august queenly seat" 82, clearly relates to the social prominence of the goddess, she is a n i n i. e. a "lady" or even "queen", and the social prominence implied is pointed up by the adjective mah "august" in her name dNin-mah "August Lady" 83. Her rank is further stressed in the epithets Gudea uses in stating how she lengthened his life: "mother of the gods" 84 pointing up her maternal authority and "The Queen (entitled) to make decisions in (all) heaven and earth" 85. His statement, which serves as name of the statue, is clearly phrased so as to emphasize the high rank of the goddess and therewith the authoritative and incontrovertible character of her decision on Gudea's behalf 86. The prominence of the goddess which here finds expression is no new thing. Rather, as Poebel was first to point out 87 Southern texts from Eannatum to Gudea consistently include her in the trio of highest gods: An, Enlil and Nin- hursaga. The reason for this high position are not altogether clear. Poebel as- sumes that her city must once have held sway over Babylonia and all the sur- rounding countries, but no evidence of such political domination of Kesh has come to light, just as no such domination by a city state of An that would have been the reason for his prominence is known. A different approach might seek the reason for her prominence in the fact that as "The L,ady of the Foothills" she represents the power in a major element of the visible cosmos 88 as do An "Heaven" and Enlil "L,ord Wind" and it is perhaps significant that in her role of associate of An and Enlil in the trio of highest gods she is consistently Nin- hursaga, hardly ever Nintur. Still a third viewpoint might suggest that the economic prominence of calving and milkgiving in the cowherder's world, as 81 An :Anum, CT XXIV pl. 12 obv. i. 10. 82 St. A ii.3. 83 Great Godlist, CT XXIV pl. 25 ibv. ii.75. 84 St. A iii. 6. 86 St. A iii. 4. 86 The epithet ama-digir-re-e-ne "mother of the gods", seems actually to belong to Ninhursaga rather than to Nintur; at any rate it is given to the former by both Ur-Bau, Statue iii. 8 and L,ú-Utu, Claynail 1-2. 87 PBS IV, , p. 24-31. 88 See our discussion of the term hur-sag-an-ki-bi-da-ke4 "the (near) mountainrange of (i. e., belonging to) both heaven and earth", in JNES 5 p. 141 = TIT, p. 117-118 and note phrases like Gudea Cyl.

Jacobsen of lambing and milkgiving in the shepherds' world, might justify her prominent position also as Nintur. Still, when all is said and done no one clear and convinc- ing answer stands out. What does strike one is rather that the unquestioned traditional prominence of the goddess appears to have created difficulties for the trend toward anthropomorphism in patriarchal political terms. A goddess as supreme ruler, rather than a god, a midwife rather than a warrior, was dif- ficult to fit into the pattern. These difficulties would seem to underlie what looks like determined attempts to reinterpret older symbols in terms of the val- ues and symbols of what might be called politico-morphism. The function of birthgoddess, extended from animal birth to birth generally, was seen as reach- ing its summit and ultimate raison d'être in the birth of highpriests and ru- lers, while the headdress with which the midwife traditionally covered her hair became reinterpreted as an emblem of the priestly and royal crowns. lugal ú-dú en ú-dú šu ( ! ) - ni-a hé-en-gál To give birth to kings, to give birth to high priests is verily in her hand, says Inanna in Bnki and World Order of Nintur, the "midwife of the nation" 89. nin en-ú-dú-da lugal-ù-dù-da d N i n - m e n - n a - k e 4 dú-dú a 1 - g á - g á The mistress of giving birth to high priests, of giving birth to kings, Ninmenna ("The lady of the Headdress") was setting birthgiving going, we are told in the myth of the creation of the Hoe 90, and lugal ù-dù mùs-zi kéš-di en ù-dù sag men-gá-gá šu-na i-gál To give birth to kings, tie on the flawles tiara to give birth to highpriests, place the headdress on (their) head, is in her hand is said of her in the hymn to her Temple in m.ZAKI 91 . A ritual of Isin-Larsa times 92, apparently dealing with the investiture of a king, has her - under her name Ninmenna - place the crown on his head, and Rim-Sin II derives his royal authority from her, he calls her Ninmah 93 . In the long run, however, the position of the goddess in the cosmic hier- archy proved untenable, and slowly she had to yield before a male god who, as she herself, represented numinous power in giving form and giving birth, the god of the fresh waters, Enki/Ea.

Unities of Person As we mentioned at the beginning of these notes, our purpose with them was not to furnish a rounded study of the goddess Nintur, but merely to pre- sent a few grouped data to exemplify the approach we outlined and the kind of problems one encounters. As will be seen the unity under which the approach attempts to subsume the varied materials bearing on an ancient deity is basically one of function historically viewed. The conceptual apparatus is that of the ancient texts them- selves, whether the characteristic functioning of the deity is there seen as flow- ing directly from his or her inner nature (intransitive), from a social, usually family, role, or, as later, from occupation or political office. Since the concep- tual apparatus is that of the ancient texts it shares with them a distinctly anthropomorphic bias. Even in cases where older, non-anthropomorph, forms survive it is already most likely that the inner form of the powers in question were seen as human, that they had been personified 94. The degree of unity achievable in these terms is not without its limits, however, and the picture of divine figures it is possible to draw are not always as sharply outlined as one might have wished. Over and over again the mate- rials, if pressed, prove to be in subtle ways instable and in flux, with shift of emphasis even to a point where identity itself may become moot. Names turn into mere epithets, epithets into names; a name may be but one of many desig- nating a given deity and yet may prove also to be that of a separate, different, minor deity in his or her entourage. Deities separate and different originally may merge and exchange characteristics. Least difficult here is probably the shift from name to epithet or vice versa, implying ideally shifts between more total denotation, name, and more partial description, epithet, for the line between these two modes of presenta- tion is a fine one indeed. All Mesopotamian divine names are, as far as one can see, descriptive in origin, and their original descriptive content is rarely lost, rather, it continues to be seen as expressive of a specific power and ability in the bearer of the name. Great gods, therefore, with great variety and scope of powers have many corresponding names. A clear example of use of proper names with such full awareness of their descriptive content offers the myth of Enki and Ninhursaga, in which the god- dess is variously referred to as dNin-sikilla "The pure (i. e. virgin) La- dy" before Enki unites with her, as dNin-tur5 amakalam-ma "Lady, womb (?), mother of the Nation", when his advances to her are told, and as "Dam-gal-nun-na "The Great Spouse of N u n (or 'the prince' i. e., Enki)" etc. 95. Very similarly in the Sumerian Flood Story she is called d N i n - 94 See above p. 282 and note the picture of Imdugud given in the Lugal- banda Epic. 95 See our comment in J NES 5 (1946) 149-150 = TIT p. 128.</page><page sequence="23">296 T. Jacobsen hur-sag-ģa as the acts with An, Enlil, and Enki creating the animals or adjures the gods to silence about the decision to bring on the Flood 98 but dNin-tur5 as she laments the destruction of her children to whom she has given birth 97. One might term such selective use of divine names "role- true", it lies halfway between denotation and description. Fully descriptive use, turning a name completely into an epithet is also found. One may quote as an example I^ugal-e 394-395 98 : nunuz-zi me-ni me-a diri-ga nin nagar-šá-ga dA-ru-ru nin 9-gal dEn-lil-lá ... Fair woman, whose offices exceed (other) offices, lady, carpenter of (i. e. in) the insides, Ar uru, older sister of Enlil . . . where absence of divine determinative shows that nagar-šá-ga is to be understood as a descriptive phrase, "carpenter of the inside" rather than, as elsewhere, as a divine proper name. A similar case is the hymn BL 75 and 97 with duplicate TuM IV no. 86: [am] a dNin-tur5 nin-mah Kéškl-a mother Nintur, august queen of Kesh the absence of divine determinative before nin-mah suggests that it is to be read as a descriptive phrase "august queen", rather than as the proper name Ninmah. As long as names and epithets can be seen as referring to one and the same divine figure, shifts from one to the other are not disturbing. Otherwise, however, when one and the same proper name occurs both as name for the birth goddess herself and for a minor figure in her entourage. This is the case with d N a g a r - š à - g a which we just saw used as a descriptive phrase. It is, however, also given as the twenty seventh name of Digirmah, Ninhursaga, Nintur etc., in A n :Anum 99 and the Great Godlist 100 but A n :Anum also lists it as designat- ing not the goddess herself but a child of hers who is the "giver of girls" 101 . Similarly the name [d]Nin-turtúr occurring as the fifteenth name of Digirmah, Ninhursaga, Nintur etc. in An :Anum102 appears to designate a separate minor goddess of her entourage in the Great Godlist 103 dNin-tùr 96 PBS V no. 1 i. 13' and iii. 18'. We read the latter passage An d En- lil dEn-ki dNin-hur-sag-gá-[ke4] digir-an-ki-ke4 mu-An-dEn-líl mu-n[i-pád-eš] "An, Enlil, Enki, and Ninhursaga adjured the gods of heaven and earth by the names of An and Enlil".

Correspondingly in the Akkadian Atraha- sis Myth Šassūru "The Womb" is both a name or epithet of Nintur and also serves to designate fourteen minor goddesses, "wombs" in her entourage104. As in the these cases deities with the same name and function turn out to be different, so conversely, in other cases, deities with different names and functions appear to have been considered one and the same. We have met with one such case in Gudea Statue A, where Ninhursaga and Nintur are considered one and the same goddess even though there is every reason to think that they were originally separate deities with separate characters and functions. Yet the fusion is so complete that the scribe who wrote the inscription could use an epithet traditionally belonging to Ninhursaga for Nintur when he wished 106 . A similar example of merging of two originally separate deities is fur- nished by the list of gods K 2109 etc. 106 where the goddess known variously as dAma-dùg-bad, dNagar-šá-ga, and dŠag4-ša-su-rum t ù r is not, as usual, identified as Bělit- ill, the Akkadian name for Digirmah, Ninhursaga, Nintur etc. but - with turning of the name Bēlit-ilī into a descriptive phrase - with be-lit ill p1- áIš-tar "the queen of the gods, Ishtar". In discussing the merging of Ninhursaga and Nintur above we suggested that unity of the situations in which these two deities characteristically re- vealed themselves might be a significant factor: the birth-hut of Nintur in the natural order of things standing in the wilderness of Ninhursaga. Similarly we may here note the close connection with the situation of childbirth in the names involved: "Mother spreading the knees", "Carpenter of the insides (i. e. in the womb)" and Šag4-túr "Womb", and the fact that both Nintur and Inan- n a 1 1 star were seen as tutelary deities par excellance, for tutelary goddesses were traditionally mothers of their human children. Nintur is also called D i- gir-lú-gu-la "The great personal deity of the man" 107 and I n a n n a / Ištar figures in the usual term for tutelary goddess ama-dInanna. Thus also here the merging of the two deities may have proceeded from a single sit- uation of numinous character, childbirth, in which they were both seen, at one time or other, as the active principle. Referring back to the characteristic situation of revelation may be help- ful not only where two different deities are seen as one, but also where, as we saw before with the name Nagaršaga and with the name Nintur, one name is used to designate a major goddess as well as to denote separate minor figures around her. What seems to have happened here is that in the total experience of birth sometimes a single feature only, the womb, or even narrower, its abil- ity to give form to the embryo, has been felt as the true locus of the numinous and has become personified as a deity in its own rights. At other times the to- tal situation with its many features has been experienced as numinous and given form as one deity with varied aspects and powers. A similar view may be taken also of the fluctuations between proper name and epithet mentioned at the beginning of this section. It would seem to de- pend on the degree to which the numinous was presented at the moment: as 104 Lambert and Millard, Atra-hasîs, p. 56 lines 1-2 and 189-190, 194, as against op. cit. p. 60 line 251 and p. 62 lines 8-9, 11, and 277. 106 See above note 86. 106 CT XXV pl. 30 rev. i.9-12. 107 CT XXIV pl. 12 i. 29, pl. 25 ii.90; TRS no. 10 line 121.</page><page sequence="25">298 T. Jacobsen bearer of more aspects than the one expressed, if so the mention tended toward the epithet; as bearer of one aspect only, if so the mention tended toward the name. In thus referring back to the underlying situation or situations of numi- nous confrontation with their various possibilities of human effort to connect up the experience of numinous power with the external situation as a whole, or with one or other prominent element in it, we underline again Otto's funda- mental insight with which we began these notes, that the numinous is sui ge- neris, "Wholly Other", outside of normal experience and indescribably in its terms. Human categories such as one and many, part and whole, personal and impersonal etc. do not thus apply and are not given with the experience. They are introduced arbitrarily, but necessarily, in the human attempt to give expression to the experience and may therefore vary with human psychologi- cal and cultural factors as well as with different individual such numinous events and different people undergoing them.</page></plain_text>
