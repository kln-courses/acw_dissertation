Collins, Natural Theology Theology and Biblical Tradition: The Case of Hellenistic Judaism (The phrase "nat ural theology" was most probably coined by the Stoics, who used.it in dis tinction from mythic and civil theology. This approach to theology was adopted by such Hellenistic Jewish writers as Philo and the author of the Wisdom of Solomon, insofar as they built their theology on an adaptation of Greek phi losophy. A locus classicus of natural theology is found in Wis 13:1-9. It entailed an ideal of philanthropia which admitted no distinction in principle on ethnic lines. Both Philo and Wisdom, however, continued to insist on the divine elec tion of Israel. The polemic against idolatry in Wis 13-19 clearly identifies the Jews as the holy people and the Canaanites as the wicked. The tension between these theological strands reflects the social situation of Jews in Alexandria in the first century ce. Upper-class Jews like Philo aspired to acceptance by the Greek community and sought common philosophical ground. The nationalis tic particularism of the Exodus story, however, spoke more eloquendy to the Jewish community when it encountered rejection and persecution in the first century ce); 251-66 Heidi M.

The angelus interpres is a mythologisation of the hermeneutical function of Philo's logos.

The common idea that the shorter Greek version of Tob is an arbitrary abridgement of the longer version can hardly be maintained. There are indications that the shorter version is based on an Aramaic Vorlage different from the Vorlage of the longer version.

Although Jesus as a Galilean possibly stood in historical contact with some Sadducees this does not explain the structural similarities and the modifications of non-Sadducean points of view in favour of a more Sadducean perspective. A social-historical explanation may account for the fact. Protesting against the integration of Palestine in the imperium romanum Sadducees and Hasmoneans fought together with the common people in Galilee. Out of this context Jesus appears as a Jewish prophet adopting the aristocratic claim of the Sadducees and extending it to the whole people.

They express a restrictive and defen sive gender moral not principally opposing marriage but seeking to restrict and control sexuality within and outside marriage. The Qumran texts do not speak in favour of asceticism in an absolute sense as a permanent way or the ultimate goal of life, but they qualify celibacy in a relative sense as a means. Possibly the Qumranites consciously neglected marriage and family life for a period of time in order to devote themselves to the eschatological identity as sectarians fulfilling the law in purity and justice by means of bodily control and generic limitations.

It was com posed in the late Persian or the early Hellenistic era; OT Israel did not come into existence before the late Persian era; the concept of the Israelite people in the OT is similar to the idea of the holy people in the DSS; it is difficult to decide whether the OT is the direct presupposition of the DSS or whether they belong to the same spiritual environment, not necessarily contemporary.

On the other hand, "in place of an eschatol ogy based on oracles not part of the Mosaic law", as in the Sibylline Oracles, he provides "an eschatology rooted in interpretations of Leviticus 26 and Deu teronomy 28 and 30."

In that theory, which survives, inter alia, in the so-called Tractatus Coislinmrms, a classification of poetry was worked out in order to find a place for didactic and related genres of poetry.

But he employed also the approach of the earlier "literalists". According to them, there were two prin ciples of Mosaic discourse, expressed in Num. 23.19 and Deut. 8.5, namely, "God is not as a man", and "like a man He shall educate his son". "Scholars have generally viewed the citation of these two verses as the means by which Philo justifies his assumptions that there are two levels of meaning in the text, and his use of the allegorical method... However, it is clear from Philo's more explicit statements that the principles belong to the legislator or to the text, not to the exegete, and correspond to two modes of discourse which Moses employs in representing God... The principle expressed by Deut. 8.5 is a reference to the literal meaning of the text when anthropomorphic rep resentations are applied, and the principle expressed by Num. 23.19 is a ref erence to the literal meaning of the text when they are not." The provenance of the two principles has to be sought in Hellenistic literary theory); 66-86 A.P.
