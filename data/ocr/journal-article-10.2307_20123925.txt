<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXPLORATIONS DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY LASZLO VERS?NYI Uf the origin of the cult of Dionysus little is known with cer tainty. The majority of scholars1 believe the god to have been a Thracian or Lydian-Phrygian import, a relatively late arrival in Greece, while some2 regard him to be as ancient as the Olympians. Homer certainly knows Dionysus, but excludes him from Olympus. Herodotus records that he was worshipped by the Thracians, but derives his cult from Egypt. In early vase-painting, he is dressed in Greek clothes, but later in Oriental garb. In fifth-century sculpture, he is seated on Olympus. In the Bacchai, Euripides makes him a Theban?with an Asiatic following. All this could be consistent with both theories. The theory of his foreign origin and late adoption, after the merger with Apollo, is perhaps more plausible, but, in view of Homer's aversion to frenzied, emotional gods and the propensity for giving a foreign identity to traits one dislikes, Homer's disregard and Herodotus' statements could be reconciled with the "ancient Greek" theory. The origin of the worship of Dionysus, however, need not concern us here. What matters is that his cult found fertile soil in post-Homeric Greece, and, spreading like an epidemic, was firmly established there no later than the seventh century. Poets, artists, philosophers, kings, and above all the mass of the people, all felt Dionysus' power and responded to his attraction in a variety of ways. Who was this strange god who exerted, in defiance of all opposition, such a great influence on the life of Greece? According to myth, Dionysus was the immortal son of a mortal woman, Semele, and an immortal god, Zeus. His mother, wanting to see Zeus face to face, was burnt by the god's thunder 1 E.g., Nilsson, Wilamowitz, Rohde, Schrade. 2 W. F. Otto, Dionysos Mythos und Kultus.</page><page sequence="2">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 83 bolt before Dionysus' birth. Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and, after giving birth to him, gave Dionysus to the nymphs to be brought up in Nysa. He and the nymphs were wont to wander in the woods, filling them with the sound of their revels. He went down to Hades to bring up his mother Semele, who was made immortal. He married Ariadne, another mortal woman whom Zeus made ageless and deathless for him. Harmless enough. But a disturbing note soon enters the stories. The myth of Lycourgos tells of the Edonian king's resistance to Dionysus mainomenos, the mad god. Lycourgos insulted the god, made Dionysus' frenzied followers captive, and drove Dionysus himself into the sea. In retribution, Dionysus brought madness upon Lycourgos, who "in his frenzy struck with an axe and killed his son Dryas, imagining that he was lopping off the branch of a vine; and when he cut off his son's extremities, he came to his senses" (Apollod.). The Edonians, at Dionysus' command, bound Lycourgos on Mount Pangaeus to be torn apart by horses. The story of Pentheus, king of Thebes, is equally rich in horror. When Dionysus comes to Thebes with a group of mainads and inspires the women of the city to nocturnal revels, Pentheus has the Bacchantes bound and imprisons the god. But Dionysus dissolves the bonds and, taking possession of Pentheus himself, turns him into a bacchant, leading him on to spy on the revellers, whereupon Pentheus is torn apart, limb from limb, by his own mother and aunts who, in their blindness, believe themselves to be dismembering a lion's whelp. Coming to their senses, they, too, are punished for their initial resistance. On and on Dionysus wanders, and each epiphany brings new disaster. Hippasos is killed by his mother. Mothers nurse the young of wild animals but dismember their own offspring, devour ing the flesh raw. Milk, honey, and wine flow in the brooks. Vines sprout on the looms of Minyas' resisting daughters. Strange music drives them mad. The earth trembles and shakes as if in childbirth. Ship-masts bloom. Nothing abides, and the god himself changes his form with lightning swiftness. In human form, he appears as an infant, a youth, a "man-woman," then as lion, snake, tiger, and bull.</page><page sequence="3">84 LASZLO VERS?NYI Elusive, contradictory?as a hunter he is hunted, as dismemberer dismembered, as possessor possessed, transformer transformed, dead reborn, until his nature dissolves in a whirl. Grasped, he is lost; lost, he stares from a mask. There, but behind the mask? Have we lost him since we cannot grasp his nature, since all masks fit yet none is essential? No, for it is precisely in this that his nature consists, that he cannot be grasped, fixed, categorized. The very whirl reveals the god's nature?madness. It does not make a description of Dionysus easier. Description is conceptual, and what is the concept that applies to a creature in constant metamorphosis? Concepts grasp and arrest, but this god changes; concepts are limiting, but this god is the dissolver of limits and boundaries; concepts are defined by their opposites, but this god includes contradiction in his nature. As if this were not enough, there is the fact that even if we somehow find concepts that apply to this god, when we try to analyze their meaning the boundaries separating the terms begin to dissolve and the mean ings merge into one almost ineffable whole that is truly?Dionysi acally?beyond words. This should be evident in the following. Homer's anthropomorphic deities mirrored in their exalted forms the characters and ideal traits of Homeric man. Dionysus, on the contrary, instead of mirroring man, transforms his worshippers in his own image. As this image is amorphic, dimorphic, or polymorphic rather than anthropomorphic, we can see it best by considering how the transformation itself is accom plished. In almost every instance, the god has the same effect on men: he makes them stark mad. But what is madness? Plato, who still felt the power of Dionysus, had this to say: "(the ancients) must have thought that there was an inspired madness which was a noble thing ... a madness superior to health of mind, for the one is only of human, the other of divine origin ..." (Phdr. 244e). Inspired and possessed by the latter, men are "not right in the mind. . . . Like Bacchic maidens they are under the influence of Dionysus. . . . God takes away the mind (of those possessed) and uses them as his ministers . . . speaking not on their own . . . but in a state of unconsciousness. . . . God is himself the speaker ..." (Ion 533-534) and his frenzied ministers are "like</page><page sequence="4">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 85 a fountain giving free course to the water which keeps flowing on . . ." (Laws 719c). The madman is ecstatic, out of his senses, not in his right mind, taken out of himself, released from the yoke of everyday existence, full of god. Entheos, possessed, in-spired, he speaks not for himself but on behalf of what is incarnate in him, the divine. One of the names of Dionysus is lusios, luaios: the looser, dis solver, deliverer, and as a dissolver he manifests himself here. His ecstatic enthusiasts are delivered from themselves, distracted from what they were as individuals and transported into a region where the bonds of the self no longer hold, where there is only god. While the Homeric gods guarded their distinctions and insisted on the distance that separated them from men, Dionysus does the opposite. Abolishing the gap between them and releasing man from himself, he bridges all distances. This union with god, this madness, the gift of Dionysus the Dissolver, the Mediator, ennobles, elevates, and exalts man beyond all that is human. Nor does Dionysus dissolve only the bonds of the self. More than any other god, he is a miracle-worker. Where he appears, the very bonds of nature seem to give way and the world to lose its sanity. It is the custom among anthropologizing classical scholars to regard Dionysus as a vegetation god who, in his epiphanies and disappearances, birth and death, represents the coming and passing of seasons within the orderly growth and flow of nature. Disregarding all other objections to this theory,3 perhaps it suffices merely to note that it is precisely the very rhythm of nature wrhich he is said to represent that Dionysus disturbs, confounds, and dis rupts. He not only distracts man from the everyday rhythm of his life and shatters the "yoke of custom and convention," (Phdr. 265) but also reverses the way, order, and natural constitution of things. Wine, milk, and honey flow where the water was, vines sprout from dead wood, the earth quakes, and parents turn in frenzy against their children. What has all this to do with the order of the seasons? Juenger aptly compares the daughters of Minyas at their loom to Clotho, Athropos, and Lachesis weaving the loom 3 Cf. Nilsson, Geschichte der griechischen Religion; Otto op. cit.; F. G. Juenger, Griechische Mythen.</page><page sequence="5">86 LASZLO VERS?NYI of moira* for just as Dionysus puts an end to the Minyides' work, so he tears apart the warp and woof of moira, too. It is moira, the allotment, the way, that makes things what they are, that defines, limits, and binds. Dionysus cancels all portions, dissolves all limits, and brings all settled order to naught. Dissolver, inverter, destroyer, his coming throws nature out of joint as if things shared the "ecstasy" of the mainads. Time itself gives way, for what is time without endurance, without orderly change? What is time for the possessed who, in a moment, experience more than eternity? The ecstatic is beyond time, or would be if he still existed, for, strictly speaking, the individual no longer exists. In the region into which he has been projected, there is only god. This is man's nature in the hands of the god. What is the nature of the god himself? In transforming men, he transforms them into his own image, and so the god that possesses and maddens must be stark raving mad himself, the dissolver must be in a condition of dissolution. To be mad means more than to partake of orgiastic revelry. It means to be self-dirempt, torn apart, to be a contradiction. That is what Dionysus is: god of life, generation, creative power, and god of death, degeneration, destruction; god of blissful trans figuration, joy, and ecstatic terror, wildness; healer, benefactor, savior, joy of mortals, god of many delights, and man-dis memberer, raw-devourer, frenzied killer. Man-woman is an apt name, for Dionysus is existence prior to the separation of opposites. This condition would have been insane only prior to an inversion of sanity: "Ere this your soul was not healthy, but now it is as should be," says Dionysus to the mad Pentheus (Bacch. 947). What was called health of soul is now madness, and madness is the soul's new health, a divine sanity superior to human sophrosune. The nature of the god does not merely embrace the irrecon cilable and subsume the contradictory. To be contradictory is still to have lasting form, but Dionysus lusios sheds shapes with Protean ease. Metamorphosis is his essence. He transforms himself, as well as man, to appear "in any manner he pleases" (Bacch. 477). He is not merely dirempt, but glitters in kaleidoscopic variability 4 Juenger, p. 185.</page><page sequence="6">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 87 as Dionysus polumorphos, polueides (Plut, de E. 9). He is a multiplicity of forms, the essence of which is that none is essential to him. This is the height of madness. Reason can grasp only the unchanging, and here nothing abides, no universal, no form, for Dionysus has none. In Euripides' Bacchai, the inadequacy of knowledge as an approach to him is repeatedly and justly empha sized (200, 395, 1005). The sane Pentheus learns nothing about himself (506) and nothing about the god. How could he, since strictly speaking there is no longer anything to be known here, least of all about Dionysus. The form knowledge can fasten on is ultimately without any relevance. It is appropriate that one of the most compelling symbols of Dionysus is the mask, for the mask expresses everything this god stands for. The mask is the unessential. It can be put on and dis carded. It can be filled with all manner of content. The same people can wear different masks and the same mask can be worn by different people. Depending on its use, the mask can make both form and content irrelevant; the mask dissolves. In Dionysus' hand all men become mere masks, "persons," "faces," possessed, inspired, and filled by nothing but the god. Ecstasy reveals the individual himself as a mask, an unessential vehicle for divinity. Accordingly, we see the possessed frantically tearing at the bonds that tie them to this unsubstantial, masklike existence. They stand out (ek-stasis) beyond the mask. The mask not only hides, it also reveals: it hides the substance and then again it also reveals it (once the mask itself is revealed qua mask) as that which is hidden. Thus, the mask is a true symbol: in presenting itself it points beyond what it presents, toward that which is hidden, un presented, and yet alone essential in the presentation. The Silenus figures sold on the Athenian market-place revealed a golden image of incomparable beauty hidden within. The mask of Dionysus functions in a similar way. The ecstatic experience reveals god within man, and the ecstasy of being possessed by god, of being delivered from the unessential personality of everyday existence, from the mask of individuality, is sheer joy. But at the same time, enthousiasmos is inexpressible terror to the intellect. The god with whom one is united, the god for whom man is a mere mask, the god that is revealed in the unmasking, reveals</page><page sequence="7">88 LASZLO VERS?NYI himself as nothing but a mask. Like a mask, he is immediately present, he is "wholly encounter,"5 visible, tangible, concrete reality with nothing withheld. But that is just the point: no matter how deep the intellect probes there is not anything else to find. What is there, completely and without reservation, is just a mask; lift and you encounter nothing. The god has no form. The faceless, formless, "impersonal" reverse of the mask only reveals the ineffability of Dionysus. This is precisely the function of the mask as a Dionysian symbol: to turn everything (men and the god) into a mask (the unessential) and to reveal it as such. In this dissolution of the mask (revealed as mask) we are left with nothing; reason despairs. This irony of the mask would be a cruel mockery of "persons" only if in ecstasy there were still any persons, masks, or distinct individual human beings left to be mocked. We have said that in this region there are no more individuals; there is only god, and in a sense even this turns out to be inexact, for the distinct, distinguishable entity of the god himself is revealed as a mask. What is "there" of the god vanishes in the ecstatic union. With all distance, limits, boundaries, and forms dissolved, how can it be said that anything still "is"? "There is," strictly speaking, nothing. This is madness. A mad ness that has the name Dionysus. We can understand why Dionysus encountered such desperate resistance in Greece as is recorded in the stories of his epiphanies. What the Greeks searched for, in the life of man, in the city, and in nature, was the immutable, abiding, universal, rational identity ?measure, proportion, harmony, balance, rhythm, law,?embrac ing all change and diversity. Dionysus, dissolving all distinction (both change and diversity and the distinct identity embracing them, both the Many and the One, both the moment and eternity), transports the ecstatic into a region where these things have no meaning; where meaning, based on separation, boundaries, limits, and definition, is itself dissolved. This meaningless realm, this unnameable ground, could it be anything but an abyss before which reason justifiably recoils ? Nevertheless, as in his epiphanies, so in the life of Greece 5 "Ganz Begegnung," Otto, Ch. 6.</page><page sequence="8">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 89 Dionysus triumphs over all opposition and initial resistance. The mass of poeple surrender themselves to the god, the poets extol his divinity, the cities sanction his cult by institutionalizing it, and Apollo, the lord of proportion, measure, and the controlled, tem perate life, ultimately joins hands with him at Delphi. This triumph, however, is to a certain extent also a defeat for Dionysus, for in the process of acceptance his character and that of his revelling associates are subtly changed and tempered, in some cases almost completely reversed. Although he influences the nature of Apollo, Dionysus also comes under the latter's sway. As one instance of this mutual influence, we may cite the prophetic and cathartic practices of Apolline priests6 and the similar rites of Corybantism, both associated by the fifth century with the cult of Dionysus. Prior to the merger with Dionysus, we find no instance of ecstatic prophecy in Apolline cult. His priests give advice and foretell the future on the basis of signs and omens, but in the sixth century we hear of frenzied prophetesses of Apollo and of wandering prophets whose character almost justifies the Platonic etymological association of prophecy with madness (mantike: mania). The Apolline Aristeas and Abaris, mentioned by Pindar and Herodotus, are entheoi: Aristeas wanders "rapt in Bacchic fury," and, like Hermotimus, he is capable of continued ecstasy. Melampus, the favorite of Apollo, is in some respects so Dionysiac that he is said by Herodotus to have introduced the cult of Dionysus into Greece. By Plato's time, there was nothing surprising in Plato's making Apollo the god of prophetic madness. Apollo, however, is also the god of purification, and so we find that his strange, frenzied, wandering priests combine the art of prophecy with that of catharsis. By purifying the polluted, they return them, free of miasma, safe and harmless, to the normalcy and security of communal life. Melampus so far combines Apolline purification with Dionysian ecstasy that, like the Corybantes, he purifies of Dionysian ecstasy by an intensification of this ecstatic state. But where is there purification of pollution in the ecstatic worship of the original Dionysus? If one can speak at all of a 6 Cf. Rhode, Psyche, Ch. IX.</page><page sequence="9">90 LASZLO VERS?NYI catharsis in connection with Dionysian enthusiasm, this is a purification from the cares and customs of everyday existence, the bonds and laws of communal life, the mask of individuality, and perhaps even the confining order of nature. Purified of all this, the ecstatic ascends to a realm of radically and inexpressibly heightened life. In union with the divine and lost to his unsub stantial humanity, he returns to the original, fundamental ground of all; purified of a merely human nature, he regains his ultimate essence: god. Far from being something shameful, deplorable, or privative, Dionysian madness is the richest, fullest, highest expe rience for a human being. There could not be a greater contrast than between this kind of experience and Apolline catharsis. What Dionysian catharsis delivers man from, Apolline and Corybantic catharses deliver men to: the everyday life of custom and convention, the life of meden agan, of knowing one's place and not transcending the bonds of moira, dike, etc. What would be called a miasma from the point of view of Dionysus?the quotidian welter?is the motivation and the object of the purificatory rites of Apollo. While ecstasy, divine abandon, and exaltation are the height of experience in Dionysus' cult, Melampus and the Corybantes only heighten madness homoiopathically in order to get rid of it. Madness, the real health in Dionysus, becomes a disease in Corybantism, and although both types of catharsis, Dionysian and Apolline, are aimed at restoring man to his nature, the two conceptions of the ultimate nature of man are diametrically opposed. For Dionysus, the essence of man is ultimately freedom in god, reached in divine ecstasy. For the Apolline variant, man is fulfilled only within the bonds of a rational, social-political existence. Dionysus soter saves us from being merely human. Salvation through Apollo consists in a return to humanity. Dionysus lusios dissolves all bondage in ecstatic transport. Apollo lusios delivers from mad ness. In spite of this radical opposition, the cathartic practices of Apollo become so closely associated with Dionysus that it is a cathartic priest whom Herodotus believes to have introduced Dionysus into Greece. As for the Corybantic catharsis, so similar to Melampus' purification of Argos, Corybantes and Bacchantes</page><page sequence="10">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 91 can hardly be kept apart by the time of the fifth century. The chorus, chanting Dionysus' hymn in Euripides' Bacchai, speaks of a "catharsis for Bacchic revelry," (77-78) associates the orgies of the Great Mother Cybele (of whose cult the Corybantes are an off spring) with those of Dionysus (78-79), and makes the Curet?s and Corybantes sing and dance as his associates around the new born Dionysus (120 ff.). Centuries before Apollodorus, who also associates Dionysus with catharses and Cybele (III, 5, 1) (as does Nonnus, cf. IX, 163; XIII, 135), Bacchai and Corybantes are almost interchangeable terms in Plato, and the Hellenization of Dionysus and his amalgamation with Apollo are so complete that Plato not only makes Apollo the god of one kind of madness, but even identifies Dionysus as the god of a ritual practice which "by the use of purifications and mysteries" releases men from affliction and restores them to a normal state! The original cult of Dionysus survives in the Orphic mysteries7 in a form much purer than its Apolline inversion. It is a question whether Orphism was a direct continuation of the not yet Hellenized worship of Dionysus or its revival, since his official, institutionalized and distorted cult failed to satisfy. What is important is that, distinct from the state-sanctioned worship of Dionysus, Orphism retained and elaborated much of the substance of the ecstatic religion and transmitted it to such effect that Dionysus could exert a stronger, more direct influence on later Greek thought than the Hellenized form of his cult alone would have been capable of. Orphic mysteries are not the only (or even, perhaps, the most important) aspect of Greek life associated with the worship of this god. Greek tragedy was performed at the great Dionysia in the theater of Dionysus. In what way the Athenian theater grew out of his festivals does not concern us here, for whether it developed of dithyrambs, satyr-plays or funeral lamentations, its Dionysian origin is certain. Without joining in the controversy about the nature of its development, we can raise the question, what traces of the original ecstatic-enthusiastic experience survive in fifth centurv Greek drama? 7 Rohde, Ch. X.</page><page sequence="11">92 LASZLO VERS?NYI To begin with the aspect of theater that lies closest to the surface, drama is related to Dionysus not only through the fact of the use of the mask, but because the mask symbolized, as it does even today, the mimetic art. The actor acts not on his own behalf, not in his own character, but, stepping out of it (ekstasis), he assumes and embodies another personality. Though he seldom speaks directly on behalf of a god (entheos), he is nevertheless possessed by his role, is out of his mind and individual nature. "Are you not carried out of yourself and does not your soul in ecstasy seem to be among the persons (acted)," asks Socrates of Ion (Ion 535), and the answer is that the actor qua actor, qua mask, is always ecstatic and possessed. Acting different parts, shedding masks, he partakes of the metamorphic, polymorph, and at the same time formless character of Dionysus. The theater is the realm of the mask, not only because the actor acts a role other than his everyday one, but because the role itself is a mask standing for or pointing toward something else?the whole play is mask like and symbolic, inasmuch as it always presents something greater than what is actually said, done, or performed in its limited scene. (The subject matter of QEdipus Rex is not just this Theban tyrant who killed his father, married his mother, etc.) The second Dionysian aspect of fifth-century theater is the intense involvement and participation of the audience in the play. The actor surrounded by the chorus and the stage by the viewers remind us of Dionysus accompanied by his mainads, and the distance between the play and the audience dissolves in the course of the performance as certainly as that between Dionysus and his revellers in ecstasy. The Athenian theater is a communal event because of its official status and because, as great theater, it is a communion of playwright, actor, audience?ultimately of all these with the Power that inspires this communion. Plato compared the dramatic performance to a magnetic field in which each ring of magnetic lines responds to the same central force, transmitted by a kind of chain reaction from god to playwright to actor to audience, until in the end all are possessed by the same (god), all sway in harmony to the tune of the Divine (Ion 535-536). Dionysus lusios breaks down all barriers and abolishes all reservation?in the theater as well.</page><page sequence="12">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 93 To achieve this communion only one thing is necessary, that the man in the audience confront himself on the stage. Can he, if the theater dissolves the personal and individual character of all participants and, taking them out of themselves, fills them with something other than their own private nature? He can and does by virtue of the Dionysian dissolution of the mask, in which the mask itself is revealed as mask, as unessential surface, so that in the unmasking man confronts, is implemented in, and united with, his fundamental nature. Like the sudden advent of Dionysus, great tragedy seizes man, claims him in his innermost being, and transforms him into something more than just this or that indi vidual person. This matter of a metamorphosis into something greater, other than what one has been, brings us to the third Dionysian charac teristic of tragedy. In the first systematic analysis of the poetic arts, Aristotle defined tragedy as the kind of imitation of serious action which, by arousing fear and pity, accomplishes a catharsis of such emotions. By catharsis, Aristotle meant, in general, a purgation of certain harmful elements which would interfere with the normal functioning of the organism in question, a kind of medical cure that effects a return to normalcy on the part of the patient. The harmful emotions interfere with everyday life, and tragedy, by giving pity and fear an object, purges the audience of them. That this medical catharsis is the kind we have encountered in the previous discussion of Apolline-Corybantic purifications is probably evident. That Aristotle, the son of a physician and an advocate of the mean in human behavior, should use the word in this connotation is not surprising. That we have to accept his judgment is uncertain. His foregoing characterization of tragedy has much the same relation to that form as the Apolline curative catharsis has to the original form of the worship of Dionysus. Plato recognized poetic madness as divine banishment of the commonplace (Phdr. 265a) and knew of a catharsis (via true virtue) through which he who is purified "will dwell with the gods" (Phaedo 69b). It is this Dionysian catharsis that makes tragedy great. By way of the unmasking, tragedy delivers us from the yoke of custom and convention. By revealing our true nature,</page><page sequence="13">94 LASZLO VERS?NYI by involving us, by breaking through pretense, by accusing us? this is what you are?by questioning us?is this all you are?? tragedy makes us more than what we seem to be in the daily busi ness of life. Like Marsyas-Socrates, the Dionysian protagonist of the Symposium who brought Alcibiades to "a pass that I have felt as if I could hardly endure the life I am leading, for he makes me confess that I ought not to live as I do, neglecting the wants of my soul," (Symp. 216) Dionysian tragedy accuses, compels, purifies, and exalts. It is a catharsis that casts up the Silenus image that we are and, tearing away the outer mask, reveals the golden image of incomparable beauty. Far from merely purging away what harms our daily life, tragedy is the mode of enthousiasmos, of man becoming more than mere man, becoming, as it were, divine. In the Republic, where he evaluates art from the point of view of its usefulness in his untragic State, Plato bans tragedy precisely because he recognizes some of its Dionysian traits. It "indulges the non-rational nature" in man (Rep. 605), "strengthens the emotions and impairs reason," (ibid.) and know ing no limit, boundary, or measure, is ecstatic-uncontrollable and therefore harmful to the State. Tragedy is no preserver of civil constitutions. It aims at much more than this. Hence Plato's main objection to tragedy and to art in general that, qua imita tion, it is far removed from the truth and must be rejected. But Plato was able to conceive an imitation that did not prevent but impelled toward the truth in a positive catharsis, aiming at the best and noblest, and he affirmed this "imitation of the best and noblest life ... to be the very truth of tragedy" (Laws 817b). And Plato's work as a whole militates against his judgment in the Republic. What is Socratic irony but a skillful technique of masking and unmasking, a revelation of all masks as merely masks? What is Platonic myth but so many masks, symbols pointing toward something that is not and cannot be directly revealed? And what is revealed by his words about the ultimate content of his philosophy, "... there is no writing by me on this, nor will there ever be; for it cannot be put in words . . .'" (7th letter, 341c), if not that all that can be expressed, all that can be rationally articulated and communicated, is but an imitation of, a mask for, ultimate truth, a truth which can be seen, grasped,</page><page sequence="14">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 95 possessed only in a Dionysian (or, now, Platonic) vision, in an abandonment to the divine, in which, by shedding all masks, even that of reason if need be, we allow It to possess us? If, in this catharsis, in this possession, man has "eyes to see true beauty, divine beauty . . . pure and clear and unalloyed, free of the pollu tions of mortality and the vanities of human life, . . . and hold conserve with true beauty simple and divine" (Symp. 211e), then the ecstatic tragedian need no longer be rejected because he is merely the inspired, unknowing agent of the divine. Ultimately, Dionysus triumphs over Apollo?even in the ironic, erotic, Socratic (-Dionysian) philosophy of Plato. As a matter of fact, Plato was not even the first to recognize tragedy as an inspired madness that delivers man from the yoke of custom and convention. Gorgias the Sophist had already done that. In Helen s Encomium, which is more of an encomium on the power of the word than on Helen, he has this to say in reference to poetry: "The inspired incantations (entheoi epoidai) of words bring on pleasure and avert grief, for the power of incantations uniting with the soul's opinion soothes and persuades and transports by means of enchantment" (Helen 10). Here too, inspired, possessed, divine (entheos) poetry transports man into another realm. This realm is not that of knowledge, but this is all to the good, for in Gorgias' Dionysian eulogy of poetry the tables have been turned: it is everyday human reason that dwells in darkness, that is deluded and blind, that is only folly,8 and ecstatic exaltation through poetry becomes true wisdom. "Tragedy creates a deception in which the deceiver is more honest (dikaioteros) than the non-deceiver, the deceived wiser than the non-deceived" (DK fr. 23). It is an apate dikaia that the tragic logos creates, a deception that reveals something more funda mental than what is open to everyday human insight, and gives greater vision than the erring, deluded, uncertain human intellect could ever aspire to. It is a deception in the sense that all idealiza 8 Cf. Helen 11, where man's lack of knowledge of past, present, and future leaves him in a realm of opinions which, "being elusive and un certain, involve those who make use of (them) in delusive and uncertain fortunes." Also Helen 13 on the untrustworthiness of meteorological (i.e. natural philosophical), legal, and philosophic arguments.</page><page sequence="15">96 LASZLO VERS?NYI tion and sublimation deceives by not presenting everyday life, and by pointing instead toward something more essential and funda mental than its commonplace surface. In this sense, however, all such deception really undeceives, for by revealing everyday life and all its pursuits as ultimately deceiving, concealing, and mere mask, it clears our vision in a marvelously inspiring-sobering manner. It is a catharsis in the best sense of the word. In the Aristotelian analysis of tragedy, catharsis is achieved through structure and incident. This structure is described as consisting of hamartia, peripeteia and anagnorisis, the last two considered by Aristotle to be "the most powerful elements of attraction" in tragedy. Peripeteia is the reversal of things into an opposite state, as is anagnorisis or recognition, the reversal from blindness and ignorance to insight. Hamartia, which underlies the peripeteia, is not depravity or badness, but rather some "great error" on the part of the protagonist, a tragic flaw in the very make-up of his character. Whether we use the Dionysian (Gorgian-Platonic) notion of catharsis or Aristotle's Apolline one, nothing could be more Dionysian than this structure of tragedy. For what is anagnorisis but an unmasking, the recognition of the mask qua mask, and what causes all peripeteia but our mask-existence, the hiddenness of the essential, the tragic flaw in our nature? Hamartia, the "great error," is not an act proceeding from man, but a state of being, of being hidden to ourselves by the mask yet not unaware of the mask, not unaware of the hiddenness. Being by nature dirempt, a visible mask on the invisible face of god, man mistakes the obvious, the mask, for his essence, and trying to hold on to it, he works at his own destruction (qua essentially divine). Aiming at one thing (to become substantially, truly what he is), he brings about its opposite (becomes more and more masklike) without recognizing it. Thus, reversal is not brought about from without but by man's own unwitting hands; it is the necessary outcome of all his efforts qua more than mask to remain (mere) mask. Being no mere mask, but also that which the mask conceals, all these efforts are doomed to fail (peripeteia), and anagnorisis, the unmasking, is inevitable. This recognition is itself a reversal, though different from the one preceding it. Where at first man</page><page sequence="16">DIONYSUS AND TRAGEDY 97 worked away from his ultimate nature and brought about the opposite of what he intended, it is this opposite state that is in turn reversed. All efforts are revealed as failure, and the hero falls. But he falls as mask?it is the mask that falls?and his defeat achieves victory. The unmasking makes him truly what he is: essentially divine. Nevertheless, there is one aspect of tragedy where the Dionysian analysis is inadequate, an aspect of tragic experience for which there is no provision in Dionysian ecstasy. It is important both for tragedy and for our investigation, because it throws light on the fact that Dionysian ecstasy fails in the end to be a solution to the problem of being a man. The end of the Dionysiac experience is ecstasy, but an ecstasy that is death for man. Man is not only divine but also human, not only hidden essence but also mask, and thus the absolute dissolu tion and destruction of all in ecstasy is ultimately inhuman. Being a mask as well, man wants to live as mask. This, and not ecstasy, makes his dirempt existence tragic. If the mask is also essential, man as man can now become neither mere mask nor "mere" divine substance. To be human means to exist as both, as ultimately dirempt, living with rather than abolishing this diremption. Hence tragedy. Williams College.</page></plain_text>
