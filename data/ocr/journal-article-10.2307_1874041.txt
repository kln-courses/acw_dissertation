<plain_text><page sequence="1">970 Reviews of Books Hraban's work as well as the limitations of his range. According to Wolfgang Haubrichs, Otfried of Weissenburg, author of an influential gospel har- mony, took his cue from Hraban in biblical exegesis but not in choosing to translate the gospels into the vernacular. Gaugolf Schrimpf demonstrates con- vincingly (though others have made the point be- fore) that Hraban, who merits a footnote in the history of Christian doctrine because of his role in the controversy over predestination, misinterpreted Gottschalk's rather enlightened and socially useful position. Raymund Kottje examines Hraban's inter- est in problems and sources of the law and finds it inspired by pastoral concerns; though not a mere compiler, Hraban was not a great canonist. Howev- er, his own legislative activity as archbishop of Mainz, during the last eight years of his life, dis- cussed here by Wilfried Hartmann, reveals common sense as well as a determined will to reform his church. These essays reflect their origin as papers pre- sented by working specialists to others of the same kind. They vary in degree of significance for an understanding of the Carolingian scholar but collec- tively provide us with a clear notion of where scholarship on Hraban stands now and what prob- lems of his work and influence remain to be ex- plored. BERNHARD W. SCHOLZ Seton Hall University PAULINE MOFFITT WATTS. Nicolaus Cusanus: A Fif- teenth-Century Vision of Man. (Studies in the History of Christian Thought, number 30.) Leiden: E. J. Brill. 1982. Pp. 248, f 78. Until relatively recently Nicholaus Cusanus has been the Melchizedek of the history of Christian thought-without parentage and with only a few contested paternities. Giordano Bruno seems to have inherited the same blood type, but fatherhood of Kant's noumenal and phenomenal world seems a long shot, with many more likely sires. With Pauline Moffitt Watts's Nicholaus Cusanus: A Fifteenth-Century Vision of Man we have an attempt to see Cusanus resolutely in the context of the spiritual and intellectual problems of late medieval and Ren- aissance culture. More specifically, Watts attempts to trace his conception of human nature and its capaci- ties to his assimilation and transformation of the four great traditions of his age: scholasticism, hu- manism, Platonism, and mysticism. It is a task that cried out to be done, and it is done here with exemplary success. As examples of con- nections between Cusanus and these traditions the following, in particular, should be noted. Cusanus's principle that "there is no proportion between the finite and the infinite" paralleled the nominalist dialectics of the potentia Dei absoluta and the potentia Dei ordinata. But Cusanus went beyond the scholas- tics in setting up more radical grounds for the absolute freedom and transcendence of God. The study sparkles in its delineation of this Ger- man Hercules's connections with Italian humanists: Toscanelli, Cesarini, Bracciolini, Traversari, Lorenzo Valla, and others. Cusanus's significant humanist associations paid rich dividends in bring- ing to his learning and library the new fifteenth- century translations of Plato and the Platonic tradi- tion. He appropriated the Platonic dialectic of unity and plurality while rejecting the existence of inter- mediaries or agents between God and the creation. Here Watts gives due attention to Cusanus's twelfth- century Platonic sources, in particular Thierry of Chartres. The transmutation of mysticism is exam- ined in conjunction with Cusanus's application of images of light and sight in two later writings, the De visione Dei and the De Beryllo. The study represents a careful analysis of each of Nicholaus Cusanus's major works, beginning with the De docta ignorantia (1440) and ending with the De apice theoriae, written a few months before his death in 1464. Cusanus's vision of man, the universe, and God has most commonly been seen in terms of a funda- mental breakthrough or reorientation, attested by the author himself, achieved in the De docta ignoran- tia. Through her Gesamtwerk approach, tracing the major themes and developments in five main chap- ter-studies, Watts is able to show not only the formidable disjunction of man from creator and natural world but also the transcending principle Cusanus evolved from the four great traditions he transmuted: he found the ultimate creative force in the human mind itself, created in the image and likeness of the divine mind. So Watts traces an affirmative anthropomorphic principle, anchored in an exploration of Genesis 1: 26, which counteracted the impersonal disjunctive metaphysic that dominat- ed Cusanus's earlier thinking. Man in his unique cosmic freedom created a world of conjectures, a world of objects, and a world of play that proved his creation in God's image and likeness. Here the author is even able to trace a convincing link to Pico's affirmation of freedom and dignity. No dulce loquentem this, but a happy conjunction with Charles Trinkaus's In Our Image and Likeness, with the humanity and divinity in Italian humanist thought. ERNEST B.
