<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conference: 'The Qur'an: Text, History and Culture'. SOAS, University of London, 12-14 November 2009 The 2009 'Qur'an: Text, History and Culture' conference, held at SOAS from the 12th to the 14th of November, was the sixth in the Centre of Islamic Studies' biennial Qur'an conference series. This year's meeting was co-convened by Professor M.A.S. Abdel Haleem, Director of the Centre of Islamic Studies at SOAS, and Dr Ayman Shihadeh, Lecturer in Islamic Studies at SOAS. The basic premise of the Qur'an conference series, which is designed to draw together academics from a number of Qur'an related disciplines and stimulate discussion, debate and research on all aspects of Qur'anic Studies, was given a broad focus this year, incorporating papers that addressed the textual study of the Qur'an itself and the history of the religious, intellectual and artistic activity that developed around it and drew on it, as well as non-textual cultural and sociological studies relating to the Qur'an. Following an opening address, in which Professor M.A.S. Abdel Haleem welcomed the participants as well as the attendants, the conference opened with a panel on 'Structure and Composition' (chair: Mustansir Mir, Youngstown State University), in which Michel Cuypers (Institute Dominicain d'Etudes Orientales) discussed the rhetorical-compositional rules of the Qur'an in his 'Semitic Rhetoric as a Key to the Question of Nazm of the Qur'anic Text', arguing for a real, underlying coherence in the Qur'anic text, which puts 'each verse in its literary context'. Ayman El-Desouky (SOAS, University of London) followed with 'Nazm, Vjaz, Discontinuous Kerygma: Approaching Qur'anic Voice on the Other Side of the Poetic' wherein he explored a unique Islamic hermeneutics of proclamation on the level of the 'discontinuous verse'. The panel closed with Thomas Hoffmann's (Aarhus University) 'From the Chaotic to the Chaordic: Rethinking Chaos and Qur'an' in which he argued for the relevance of chaos-notions in regard to the Qur'an, proposing a radical rethinking of the Qur'anic chaotic, one that appreciates the chaotic as a salutary conceptualisation and exegetical tool. This first panel was followed by a presentation by Michael Marx, Hadiya Gurtmann and Jens Saur of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences on 'Documenting the Journal of Quranic Studies 11.2 (2009): 149-153 Edinburgh University Press DOI: 10.3366/E1465359110000859 ? Centre of Islamic Studies, SOAS www.eupjoumals.com/jqs</page><page sequence="2">150 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Textual History of the Qur'an: The Approach of the Corpus Coranicum Project'. The researchers outlined the objectives and approach of the 'Corpus Coranicum' project and discussed how the project covered documentation of the various sources, manuscripts and material evidences from the texts of Islamic scholarship. After lunch, the second panel of the day, 'The Qur'an and Medieval Philosophy' (chair: Ayman Shihadeh, SOAS, University of London), included papers from Peter Adamson (King's College, University of London) on 'Abu Bakr al-Razi on Prophecy', (wherein he suggested that Abu Bakr al-Razi's position on prophecy was far more nuanced than otherwise perceived, and posited that rather than attacking prophecy as a whole, he should be perceived as criticising schismatic groups within Islam); Daniel De Smet and Meryem Sebti (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris) on 'Avincenna's Philosophical Approach to the Qur'an in the Light of his Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas\ (which sought to investigate Avicenna's treatise Tafsir Surat al-Ikhlas, also known as Tafsir al-Samadiyya, with regard to the influence of the Qur'an and revelation on his metaphysics), and Heidrun Eichner's (Freie Universitat, Berlin) 'The Hermeneutics of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi's Qur'an Commentary: A Link between Philosophy and Sufism'. The final panel of the first day 'Theological Aproaches to the Qur'an' (chair: Elsaid Badawi, American University of Cairo), included Anthony H. Johns' (Australian National University) 'The Transfiguration of the Spoken Word: A Humanistic Approach to Tjaz' a reflection on the icjaz of the Qur'an from the perspective that the Qur'an, as a series of locutions - each distinctive to the moment of revelation - offers a transfiguration of human speech as a vehicle of divine revelation. Abdessamad Belhaj (Pazmany Peter Catholic University) presented on 'Argumentation of the Qur'an through al-Muzaffar al-Razi's Hujaj al-Qur'an and al-Tufi's 'Alam al-JadhaV', an analysis of the technical vocabulary used in these two works as reflecting a development in the field of rhetorical, dialectical and Qur'anic studies; Ahmad Achtar's (Heythrop College, University of London) 'al-Zamakhshari's Unique Hermenuetics of Anthropomorphic Verses in the Qur'an: Majaz based on Kinaya and TakhyiV argued that al-Zamakhshari used al-Jurjani's theory of majaz as a basis from which he developed two unique hermeneutical tools to interpret anthropomorphic ayas; and the day was brought to an end by Christopher Melchert (University of Oxford), who discussed the well-attested hadith about God's creation of Adam in His image and the subsequent discussion of this subject (or lack thereof) in the tafsir works of al-Tabari, al-Mawardi and al-Qurtubi in his 'God Created Adam in His Image'. The morning of the second day of the conference, Friday 13th November, was devoted to Tafsir, and comprised two panels, chaired by Toby Mayer (Institute of Ismaili Studies) and Muhammad Abdel Haleem (SOAS, University of London) respectively. Papers presented included Robert Morrison's (Bowdoin College in</page><page sequence="3">Notes, Reports and Correspondence 151 Brunswick) 'Astrology and Tafslr\ in which he used Tafsir literature to argue for a more considered attitude towards Astrology, on the basis that, although previous research on religious reactions to astrology in Islamic civilisation has used hadith and kaldm texts to conclude that the prevailing attitude was one of disapproval, discussions of judicial astrology in al-Tabari's JamV al-bayan, for example, attach validity to astrological predictions. Jamal Elias' (University of Pennsylvania) 'Sufi Tafsir Reconsidered: Exploring of the Development of a Genre' sought to argue that Suf! Tafsir does not constitute a single scholarly genre across time, but is motivated by a variety of factors (such as the ritual or aesthetic) in which the act of writing is the most important element; Mustansir Mir's (Youngstown State University) 'Reading the Qur'an with the Bible in Mind' discussed the use of the Bible as an aid to Qur'anic exegesis and considered in particular the views of the Modern exegetes Hamid al-DIn al-Farahl and Amin Ahsan Islahl; Badri N. Zubir's (International Islamic University, Malaysia) 'Al-Sharif al-Radi's Contribution to Qur'anic Exegesis: An Analysis of Talkhis al-Bayan f Majaz al-Qur'an* attempted to 'discover' al-Sharif al-Radi's concept of majaz, examining his interpretive method and considering the significance of his work within the context of the development of the Tafsir tradition; and finally, Husain Qutbuddin's (Academy of Advanced Studies in South-Asian Islam and Arabic, Mumbai) 'The Fatimid Legal Hemeneutics: the Da'a'im al-Islam of al-Qadi al-Nu'man (d. 363/974)' outlined the hermeneutical techniques employed in the interpretation of the Qur'an within this text, wherein al-Qadi al-Nucman asserts that the Qur'an alone is not a guide, but must be accompanied by a designated interpreter for its time. A break for lunch and jumuca was followed by the two afternoon sessions of the day 'Ethics in the Qur'an' (chair: Anthony H. Johns) and 'The Qur'an in the Contemporary World' (chair: Sebastian Gunther, Universitat Gottingen). In the first, Patrick Franke (Universitat Bamberg) presented on 'Islamic Morality in the Making: The Sexual Ethics of the Qur'an and its Late Antique Context', an examination of how a parallel reading of late antique texts pertaining to sexuality may contribute to a better understanding of the Qur'anic sexual ethics; Nora S. Eggen (University of Oslo) discussed how trust, trustfulness and trustworthiness are conceptualised in different Qur'anic discourses in her 'Conceptions of Trust in the Qur'an: the Case of Amana'; Khalid Troudi spoke on nazm al-QurJan in his 'Hermeneutical Aspects of the Qur'anic Narrative: The Function of Coherence and Style'; A. David K. Owen (Harvard University) presented on 'Whither Averroism: Does Ibn Rushd's Interpretation of the Qur'an Provide the Basis for a Modernist Re-reading of Islamic Law?', a paper which sought to investigate whether Ibn Rushd's method of interpreting the Qur'an provides a basis for re-reading revelation in order to bring Islamic law in line with 'reason' and changed circumstances; Johanna Pink (Freie Universitat, Berlin) outlined 'A Typology of Contemporary Sunni Tafsir: Sources,</page><page sequence="4">152 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Methods and Aims of Qur'anic Commentaries from the Arabic World, Indonesia and Turkey since 1967' by looking at a number of Tafsir works, with the intention of deriving analytical categories that contribute to our understanding of Qur'anic exegesis in present times and of the various 'influences' that shaped the results of these exegetes' work; and, in the final paper of the session, Hasan al-Shafie (University of Cairo) spoke on 'Qawa'id al-'aqida fi'l-Qur'an\ 'Early Manuscripts' (chair: Abdul-Hakim al-Matroudi, SOAS, University of London) was the opening session of the conference's third and final day, with papers from Alain George (University of Edinburgh), 'On Chronology and Provenance in Early Qur'ans', in which he explored new pathways that might enhance our understanding of the dates and provenance of Early Qur'ans by outlining a broad chronology of early Arabic calligraphy, following which he sought to assess, by confronting the conventions observed in a manuscript sample with those described by al-Dani, whether this text can yield insights about regional variations in the craft. Anne Regourd (CNRS and the Louvre), 'One More 'Abbasid Qur'an: IFAO, Edfou 73\ offered a comparison of a single folio of parchment, bearing ayas from Surat Al cImran and dated to the beginning of the third/ninth century, found during the excavations of Edfou in the 1920's to two fragmentary parchments of the Qur'an stored in the French National Library; and Shannon Wearing (New York University), 'Precious Blood, Sacred Text: The Legacy of the 'Uthmanic Qur'an', explored the legacy of the cUthmanic Qur'an in Islamic history and material culture and the use of extant and lost 'cUthmani' codices in religious practice, and as Islamic relics. In 'Early Qur'anic Texts' (chair: Mustafa Shah, SOAS, University of London), Asma Helali (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris) discussed some textual aspects of the Sanaa palimpsest (discovered in the 1970s) in 'The Sanaa Palimsest: Introductory Remarks to Philological and Literary Aspects' in a paper which focussed on some specific examples of textual variants from two angles: the differences between the palimpsest and two other old Koran manuscripts, and the difference between the palimpsest and the official text of the Qur'an, the Cairo edition of the 20th century. Following this, Michael Marx (Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences), gave a historical overview of Gotthelf Bergstrasser's photoarchive and European scholarship of Qur'anic manuscripts in 'The Qur'an according to Agfa: The Gotthelf-Bergstrasser Photoarchive of Qur'anic Manuscripts and the Question of Material Evidence for the Study of the Textual History of the Qur'an'. The panel closed with Amr Osman's (Princeton University) discussion on the history of the various waqf categories in 'A Neglected Aspect of the History of the Qur'an: The Waqf Rules and the Redaction of the Qur'anic Text', in which he posited that the various different positions held as to where to pause when reading or reciting the Qur'anic text are in themselves a form of tafsir, in that this can fundamentally affect the meaning of the Text.</page><page sequence="5">Notes, Reports and Correspondence 153 The afternoon then provided two panels: 'Cultural Expressions' (chair: Sebastian Gunther) and 'Literary Perspectives' (chair: Stefan Sperl, SO AS, University of London). Natalia Viola (The Islamic Manuscript Association, Cambridge) opened with 'West African Qur'ans: Codicological Features of the Sudani Style', an exploration of the writing style and aesthetic traits of the West African Qur'anic tradition in the light of the local sub-varieties of calligraphic traits represented in the Sudani style as well as the various geometric ornamentation used as markers within the text. This was followed by Jeffrey Einboden's (Northern Illinois University), 'The Early American Qur'an: Islamic Scripture and U.S Canon', wherein he examined the influences of Islamic scripture in the canonical works of early American literature by authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe and Walt Whitman; and Elsaid Badawi (American University in Cairo), who in his 'Qur'anic Recitation and Audience Rhythm: The Case of the Egyptian Reciter, Mustafa Isma'il (1905-78)' sought to explore, via a selected number of live recordings, the nature of Mustafa Ismail's recitation style, in which both reciter and audience were active participants in the act of recitation. On literary perspectives, Todd Lawson (University of Toronto), in a paper entitled 'The Qur'an as Epic: A Consideration of Formal and Thematic Elements', addressed the subject of the Qur'an as epic in terms of form, and in the light of the subsidiary themes of humanity, community, apocalypse, and the path or road. This was followed by Shawkat Toorawa's (Cornell University) '(Absent) Fathers in the Qur'an' in which he explored the motif of 'fatherhood' in the Qur'anic text, positing a gradual progression in the Qur'an's presentation of 'fathers' and tying this to the larger Qur'anic narrative. Hanadi Behairi (Umm al-Qura University) brought the conference to an end with 'The Fantastic in the Qur'an: A Structural Approach to Study the Story of Moses and al-Khidr (Q. 18:60-82)', in which she discussed Todorov's idea of the fantastic in the context of the Qur'anic story of Moses' encounter with al-Khidr. In his closing address Professor Abdel Haleem thanked the speakers and chairs for their contributions, and looked ahead to the next meeting in autumn 2011. Selected proceedings will be published in forthcoming issues of the Journal of Qur'anic Studies.</page></plain_text>
