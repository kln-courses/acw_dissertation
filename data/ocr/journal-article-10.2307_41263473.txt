Powers Travel Award from Oberlin College permitted photographer Sheba Haner and myself to travel to Mexico and spend several days at Acanceh. Mrs. Haner not only recorded the frieze's current condition in detail, but also developed and printed many of the photo- graphs reproduced in this book. Norberto Gonza- lez C., then director of the Centro Regional Sur- este of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Edward B. Kurjack, and Anatolio Narvaez M., guardian of the archaeological zone, all facilitated work at the site. Much of the research on Acanceh was com- pleted in 1981-82 while I was a Fellow in Pre- Columbian Studies at Dumbarton Oaks in Wash- ington, D.C. I am indebted to Elizabeth H. Boone, Director of Pre-Columbian Studies, and her staff for their support during the year. I would also like to thank John S. Justeson, the other Fel- low in Pre-Columbian Studies that year, for many stimulating discussions and for sharing his knowl- edge of Maya hieroglyphic writing with me. In 1982 and 1986 I visited the City of Bristol Museum in Bristol, England, to examine and pho- tograph Adela Breton's watercolors of the stucco frieze, which, with the museum's permission, are published here for the first time. The support of the museum staff - David Dawson and Jennifer Stewart, Curators in Archaeology and History in 1982 and 1986 respectively, and Museum Assis- tants Mrs. Mary Campbell and Miss Susan Giles (now Assistant Curator) - was greatly appreci- ated. On both occasions the museum photogra- phers also made my task considerably easier, and I am particularly grateful to Mr. Andy Cotton for developing my black and white photographs in the museum lab on the spot. The second trip to Bristol was sponsored by the English-Speaking Union of Chicago, whose assistance is gratefully acknowledged. The support of the Campus Research Board of the University of Illinois-Chicago in funding the publication of the complete set of extant Adela Breton watercolors of the Acanceh frieze for the first time in color is greatly appreciated. Early photographs at Acanceh are published here with the permission of the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard Uni- versity. Daniel W. Jones, Jr., the museum's Photo- graphic Archivist, was responsible for assisting me in locating the negatives and providing the prints. In 1984 a National Endowment for the Humani- ties Travel to Collections Grant allowed me to study William Gates' unpublished manuscript on Acanceh as well as his notes, photographs, and drawings of the Palace of the Stuccoes, which are housed in the Harold B. Lee Library at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. I thank Dennis Rowley, the Curator of Archives and Manuscripts, and Miss Billie Plunkett, Curator of Photographs, for taking the time to locate the material. Martin Raish of the Art Department kindly arranged for the illustrations to be photographed and sent to me. John Cullen, of the History of Architecture and Art Department of the University of Illinois- Chicago, typed the manuscript with both care and good humor. Dr. Donald McVicker read the entire manuscript and provided me with extensive and useful comments. I thank Patricia K. Anderson for drawing the map of the Maya region. Finally, I wish to thank the many other colleagues who shared their ideas on Acanceh with me and offered both criticism and encouragement of my efforts.</page><page sequence="5">List of Figures vii 1 .

The 13 m long surface, protected by a coat of white- wash and the rubble of later buildings, displayed two rows of animal, bird, and human figures modeled in relief and contained within twenty- one overlapping cartouches (Fig. 3). The scene was framed at either end by large stucco birds and above and below by decorative moldings. While the context of the wall was not understood at the time, later excavations showed it to be the upper facade of a small Maya structure now known as the Palace of the Stuccoes. The find, first reported in 1908 in a brief article by Adela Breton, was remarkable in several ways. In the first place, the excellent state of preservation of the facade at the time of its discovery made it a rarity in the northern Maya lowlands where little architectural decoration in stucco has survived. Sec- ond, the motifs represented and the composition of the frieze are unique in Maya monumental art. Finally, in both style and iconography the frieze displays an intriguing mixture of Maya and non- Maya features that has puzzled iconographers since its discovery. Given the advances that have been made in recent decades in Maya studies in general and in northern lowlands archaeology in particular, Acanceh's Pal- ace of the Stuccoes deserves to be reexamined. At one time the best preserved of the handful of stucco-ornamented structures extant in the north- ern lowlands, it occupies an important place in the rather sketchy history of the region prior to the rise of cities like Uxmal and Chichen Itza. Further- more, it will be shown here that the eclectic style and iconography of the facade serve not to isolate it but rather to place it within the broader, cosmopoli- tan tradition of contemporaneous highland sites like Xochicalco and Cacaxtla. Breakthroughs in Maya epigraphy, linguistics, and iconography have also made possible a deeper understanding of the frieze's unique subject mat- ter. The revelation that bloodletting permeated Maya ritual life to a greater extent than previ- ously realized, for example, is reflected not only in the presence of blood and sacrificial themes here but also in the Teotihuacan-derived motifs, now associated in Maya iconography with war- fare and sacrifice. Cave and water imagery, as well as the particular birds and animals repre- sented, can be seen as references to the Maya un- derworld, a theme now well-documented in paint- ed funerary ceramics but relatively rare in monu- mental, public art. Following its discovery, pioneers in Maya ar- chaeology such as Teobert Maler and Sylvanus G. Morley came to view the facade, and in 191 1 Eduard Seler published the only detailed analysis and drawing (by W. von den Steinen) of the relief (Fig. 3). William Gates was to have published a colored drawing of the frieze shortly before his</page><page sequence="8">'So &lt;u _&gt; D j-i rtf &gt; U4 rt X a 3 &lt;u t/5 3 S &gt;s T3 O -Q r3 Pi* &lt;U Vw o &gt;N V) &lt;U tn 3 O u uT Jh 2 &lt;L&gt; -T5 O £ -Q CL, &lt;X u M 0 O 01 t&gt; T 00 C/5 «-l &lt;u u rt u rt J5 u &lt;u *T3 u &lt;2 .g Ul O G J-! c/5 &lt;N W) PU</page><page sequence="9">death in 1940. His accompanying text, however, represents an attempt to attribute the architectural style of the northern lowlands to the Xius, with the site of Acanceh mentioned only incidentally. Although no description of the earliest excava- tions exists, both Breton and Seler saw painted walls in either the Palace or the building immedi- ately opposite. Seler reproduced some of the paint- ed hieroglyphs in a later version of his paper on the site (1902-23), while Breton's copies of the fragmentary figures, published here for the first time, were left to the Bristol Museum, unmen- tioned in any of her publications or papers (see Appendix) (Figs. 44-46; Pis. 7-9). The limited archaeological explorations undertaken at Acan- ceh in the 1930s and 1940s were directed primar- ily toward the consolidation of the facade (Ferna- dez 1939) and to establishing a relative chronol- ogy for the site based on ceramic and architectural analysis (Andrews IV 1942, 1965; Brainerd 1942, 1958). The brief reports issued as a result of these archaeological excavations did not address the meaning or significance of the stucco reliefs. The Palace has been mentioned frequently in Me- soamerican literature because of the exotic charac- ter of its facade (e.g., M. Coe 1987: 84). Until recently, however, little had been added to Seler's discussion of the facade's iconography. The redis- covery of the Breton watercolors at Bristol in the early 1970s, coupled with increasing scholarly in- terest in cross-cultural relationships in Mesoamer- ica, has revived interest in Acanceh. In 1985, for example, Hasso von Winning pub- lished a brief study of the facade based on Breton's work and the photographs taken around 1928 by American businessman, inventor, and Maya enthu- siast T. A. Willard. Von Winning (1985: 40, fig. 41) interprets the frieze conventionally as a two- dimensional, vertical view of the Maya universe expressing the necessity of propitiating rain deities with blood and incense offerings to insure agricul- tural fertility. He also sees the influence not only of Teotihuacan, but also of Oaxaca, Tlaxcala-Puebla, and the Gulf Coast, but does not indicate the mode of transmission or a motive for adopting foreign features. A recent dissertation (Freer n.d.) on the relation- ship of the Puuc area to other regions of Meso- america includes a discussion of the frieze and its Teotihuacan connections. Freer, unfortunately un- aware of the redating of the Palace of the Stuccoes (see below), places it too early. Although he ap- pears to postulate direct Teotihuacan contact with Yucatan, including occupation, neither the archae- ological evidence at the site nor the architecture and decoration of the Palace of the Stuccoes sup- ports his hypothesis. Finally, the City of Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, Bristol, England, recently presented an exhibition of Breton's work in Mexico, the first dedicated solely to her paintings since 1946 (Giles 1989: 60). The accompanying catalogue (Giles and Stewart 1989) includes several essays that re- fer to Breton's presence at Acanceh, as well as two color reproductions of details of the frieze (von Winning 1989; V. Miller 1989; M. McVicker 1989). The publication of Breton's better-known paint- ings of murals and artifacts from Chichen Itza (A. Miller 1977; Coggins and Shane 1984) has been a catalyst for searching out her work at other Mexican sites. The urgent need to record rapidly disappearing polychrome painting and sculpture throughout Mesoamerica has also brought atten- tion to Breton's pioneering efforts (Kinoshita 1990). While the existence of a few watercolors cannot compensate for the destruction of major monuments, it does at least provide another chance for discovering just what the ancient Meso- americans considered worth recording on the inte- rior and exterior walls of their buildings. Illustrations of the Frieze If one were to rely on the stucco reliefs in their present condition, the task of analyzing the frieze would be hopeless: vandalism and the elements have almost completely erased the painted stucco figures from the facade. As of 1981, only charac- ters 14, 15, 17, and 19 were relatively intact, while portions of characters 8, 10, 12, 13, 16, and 18 remained (Fig. 4).1 It was not, in fact, until 1 The characters are numbered from left to right, after the drawing published by Seler in 191 1. 3</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 3 Str. i, north facade. After Seler, 1902-23: pl. 11. 1940 that a protective roof was placed over the exposed wall. Fortunately, excellent photographs by early visitors to the site exist, some published by Seler and others, and some housed in the pho- tographic archives of institutions like the Peabody Museum at Harvard University and the library of Brigham Young University. While individual pho- tographs cannot always be attributed to specific photographers, it is known that Seler, his wife, Caecilie Seler-Sachs, Teobert Maler, Breton, and Mr. and Mrs. W. M. James of Merida all photo- graphed the frieze soon after it had been un- covered. With Seler's drawing of the frieze, these images provide an invaluable record of the frieze as it looked at the time of its discovery. More important, the indefatigable Adela Bre- ton, well known for her copies of the Chichen Itza murals, spent five weeks at Acanceh in 1907 making a watercolor rendition of the relief (Carmi- chael 1973: 30-32). It is published here in totality for the first time (Figs. 20, 25, 28, 32, 42; Pis. 1- 4, 6). The watercolor, now in the City of Bristol Museum, is drawn to scale and divided into sev- eral sections. Unfortunately, the section from char- acter 12 to character 17 is missing, although Bre- ton's black and white drawings of characters 1-4 and 8-17 are also in Bristol.2 A detail from a 2 A black and white photograph of the missing part of Breton's watercolor is at the Bristol Museum, as is a partly colored sketch of characters 12-15. Another black and white hand-colored photograph of the entire frieze, now in the Peabody Museum, has been substituted for the missing section (Fig. 40; PI. 5). 3 Traces of paint still visible on the facade indicate that the colors of both the photograph and Breton's water- color are generally correct.4 photograph of this watercolor, showing parts of characters 1 1 and 1$ and characters 12-14, is in the Gates collection at Brig- ham Young University. Gates does not indicate when or where he obtained the photograph, although a second photo- graph in the collection is of part of the painting still in the Bristol Museum. 3 Neither the photographer nor the colorist of the photo- graph is known, although this and a number of black and white photographs were a gift of Mrs. W. M. James to the Peabody Museum in 19 10. Mr. and Mrs. James were residents of Merida and aficionados of Maya archaeology, and Mrs. James must have been one of the first to photograph the frieze (Breton 1908: fig. 2). According to Ian Graham (personal com- munication, 1982), the photographs in the Peabody Museum that cannot be attributed to Maler were taken by Mr. James. In an early version of his Acanceh manuscript, William Gates indicates that the colors on his set of colored photographs were provided by Mr. James as well. Gates obtained a series of photographs of the frieze, at least some of which are by Maler, from a private Mexican collector in about 191 5. These hand-colored photographs were being used by Gates to determine the colors for his drawing of the frieze, a partially colored version of which is also at Brigham Young University. The photographs in the Gates collection may very well be the same as those donated by Mrs. James to the Peabody Museum. 4 There is, however, a discrepancy in the colors of the frames surrounding characters 12-15 between the photograph and the partially colored drawing. Both the outer and inner frames of character 15, for example, are shown as yellow in the former (Fig. 40), while in the latter the outer is red and the inner is blue. The few other details in color in the Breton drawing correspond to the photograph. 4</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 4 Str. i, characters 14-17.

The drawing published by Seler (Fig. 3), while good, contains small errors, while the unpublished version by Gates is the least ex- act. All other drawings of the frieze appear to be based at least in part on Seler's (cf. Figs. 12, 13). Archaeological Investigations at Acanceh The Site The modern town of Acanceh overlies an ex- tensive Pre-Hispanic settlement which is men- tioned in several sixteenth- and seventeenth-cen- tury sources, including the Chilam Balam of Chumayel (Roys 1933: 73; Edmonson 1986: 91), the Land Treaty of Mani of 1557 (Roys 1943: 185), the Relaciones de Yucatan (1898, 11: chap. 3), Documentos para la Historia de Yucatan (Scholes et al. 1938, 2: 58), and Cogolludo (1957, 1: bk. 4, chap. 20) (Fig. 5). Little is recorded, however, of either the Pre-Conquest or Colonial history of Acanceh, although it is believed to have been within the borders of the Province of Chakan (Roys 1952: 174). Edmonson (1986: 269) identi- fies the town as number 162 of 171 places re- corded in a ceremonial circuit of Yucatan com- memorating katun 11 Ahau (1539). The name Acanceh is usually translated from the Yucatec as "cry of the deer" (acan, "cry," ceh, "deer"). Other suggested etymologies include "pond (acaan) of the deer," "water muddied by deer" (Brito Sansores 1979: 365), "covered deer" (Edmonson 1986: 283), and even an unidentified medicinal plant (Roys 1957: 38). The first modern report on the archaeological site is a brief reference by Desire Charnay (1888: 287), who visited the town in 1881 (Davis 1981: 178). He refers to three pyramids on the plaza, one of which supplied the building material for the Acanceh train station. In this unidentified mound, Charnay found "fine sculptured blocks, like those employed at Uxmal" as well as "vases identical to those we unearthed at Teotihuacan." None of his finds, which also included "funeral objects," obsid- ian, and a "sceptre," are illustrated or described in more detail, unfortunately. But well before the dis- 7 covery of the famous frieze, the explorer did men- tion the affinity between Yucatan and highland Mexico as demonstrated by the ceramics he found here. The Pyramid Before the discovery of the Palace of the Stuc- coes, Acanceh was best known for the large, Late Pre-Classic pyramid on the main plaza of the town (Figs. 5-7) (cf. Seler 191 1: pl. vi; Fernandez 1939* fig- 15; Marquina 195 1: pl. 202; Garza and Kurjack 1980: fig. 10). The pyramid was first un- covered and explored by Maler, who apparently left no published record of his efforts (Fernandez 1939: 249). Subsequent limited excavations were undertaken by Mexican archaeologist Miguel An- gel Fernandez (n.d., 1939) and in 1941-42 by E. W. Andrews IV (1942, 1965) and George Brai- nerd (1958). The base measures 32 m, and the whole structure must have originally stood over 1 1 m in height. The stairs are 5 m wide (Marqui- na 195 1 : 800). A radial structure with rounded inset corners, apron moldings, and recessed stairways, the Acanceh pyramid recalls other early pyramids like Uaxactun's E-VII-sub. Indeed, this complex of traits is thought to derive from the Peten. In the north, the entire set of features is rarely found in a single structure, although elements do occur sepa- rately, at Coba, Kohunlich, and Dzibilchaltun (An- drews and Andrews 1980: 126-127). A largely de- stroyed platform uncovered at a little-known ruin near Colonia, Yucatan has been compared to the Acanceh pyramid, although its apron moldings are not as broad, nor were any stairs uncovered (W. Coe 1952). The large (ca. 2.8 m square) stucco masks that once flanked the stairs on the upper terrace of the Acanceh structure have disappeared. Breton (1908: 37) first noted their resemblance to the large stucco masks at Izamal. The masks, as well as the steps, had once been painted red and had been hidden by a 6 m layer of rough stones which were removed by Maler, thus exposing them to the elements (Seler 191 1: 1012-1013; Marquina 195 1: 800). A burial chamber on the summit of the pyra- mid is reported to have contained the remains of a</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 6 Main plaza of Acanceh, looking north toward main pyramid.

Marquina (195 1 : 800) reports that Maler uncovered a small vaulted chamber, remov- ing a gourd-shaped pot with an inscribed hiero- glyphic inscription. But this vessel, now in the regional museum of anthropology in Merida, is also purported to be from the main pyramid at Mayapan (Brainerd 1958: fig. 90c). The Acropolis and the Palace of the Stuccoes Approximately 300 m southeast of the early pyramid is the Acropolis, a massive substructure about 8 m high and 50 m at the base (Figs. 5, 8, 9). It is surmounted by the remains of numerous buildings, including the Palace of the Stuccoes at its northern edge (Figs. 10, 11). When the Palace of the Stuccoes was first uncovered, the struc- ture's facade was exposed only to the level of the medial moldings.5 As a result, there was confu- sion regarding the nature of the building: Breton (1908), for example, interpreted the wall as the highest terrace of a pyramid containing burial chambers. Later excavations revealed that it was the upper facade of a building with interior cham- bers, and it became known as the Palace of the Stuccoes. The term "palace" has been loosely applied to any relatively large, multichambered Maya struc- ture located on a low platform as opposed to a pyramidal base (cf. G. Andrews 1975: 43). 6 Since the size of the Acanceh structure is fairly small and the height of its base unknown (although the Acropolis itself rose to at least 8 m), the building may just as well have been a temple. Andrews IV, in fact, preferred to call it the Stucco Temple (1942: 258). Because the name Palace of the Stuccoes has become established in the literature, that name will be retained here. The use of the term "palace," however, should not be construed as necessarily imparting a residential function to the building: it 5 A recently published photo of the Palace of the Stuccoes by Teobert Maler shows clearly the rubble that still filled the space between it and the structure opposite at the time of its discovery (Graham 1990: 38-39). 6 Good recent discussions of the "palace problem" in Maya architecture can be found in Kowalski (1987: chap. 6) and Harrison (1986). more likely served as an administrative or religious structure. Furthermore, factors such as its site, doors and windows, benches, alterations, length of occupation, and presence or absence of refuse, not just the structure's plan, must be taken into account in determining how a structure was used. The less loaded term "range-type structure" re- flects the form of a building rather than its func- tion but is cumbersome. Since the function of many better-excavated Maya structures is still the subject of scholarly argument, it is highly unlikely that we will ever know exactly what activities took place in the Palace of the Stuccoes. Reconstructing the Palace of the Stuccoes In 1933 Miguel Angel Fernandez excavated the structure to floor level and consolidated what re- mained of the building and facade. Fernandez' work indicated the approximate plan and dimen- sions of the Palace of the Stuccoes, as well as the existence of a three-chambered building to the north (Fernandez n.d., 1939). The Palace, about 13 m long, consisted of four vaulted chambers, the two east-west rooms measuring approximate- ly 2 m by 6 m, and the two north-south ones 2 m by 5 m (Marquina 1951: 802). Each of the rooms had at least one doorway to the exterior, although none of the four rooms apparently intercon- nected. The plan is comparable to other structures in the northern lowlands, particularly early ones such as Aka'na at Yaxcopoil (Andrews IV 1965: fig. 18) and some of the buildings at Dzibilchal- tun, such as Str. 57 (Andrews and Andrews 1980: fig. 199). In Arquitectura prehispanica (1951: 800-805), Mar- quina provided the first published drawings of the elevation, plan, and sections of the Palace of the Stuccoes (Fig. 12). Marquina's drawings differ slightly from those based on Andrews' investiga- tions at the site in 1941-42 (Fig. 13). He places the door to the south vaulted chamber at the center of the room, for example, rather than slightly to the west as indicated by Andrews. Marquina also in- cludes what appears to be a wall topped by a lin- tel, at the back of the north chamber, reaching only as high as the springing of the vault. The source for this projecting wall is not clear, as it is 9</page><page sequence="16">Fig. 8 Plan of Acropolis and adjacent areas.

Marquina's rendition of the north facade, however, takes into account Fernan- dez' description of the two lateral doors which had at some point been covered over and con- verted into lattice-work "windows" (cf. von Win- ning 1985: fig. 2). The stucco material used to create the windows is different from that of the facade above, suggesting that the windows were constructed later (Fernandez 1939: 253). Dating the Palace of the Stuccoes In 1941-42 E. W. Andrews IV and George Brainerd explored Acanceh as part of a survey of sites near Merida. In an attempt to date both the pyramid and the Palace of the Stuccoes, several trenches were made at the base of the Acropolis and in front of the Palace, and ceramic samples were collected (Andrews IV 1942, 1965; Brainerd 1958). Andrews discovered that the platform on which the Palace stood was extended to the north at least twice, and not long afterwards the second structure was built opposite it. The floor level be- tween the two buildings was raised five times be- fore both structures were filled with rubble and covered over to serve as the foundation for later buildings (Fig. 13). Although no standing architec- ture remains from the later construction phase, carved stone facade ornaments and veneer wall blocks attest to a Pure Florescent date (ca. a.d. 800-1000), according to the chronological se- quence developed for the northern lowlands by Andrews IV (1942: 258; 1965: 296). ?

Although Brainerd's analysis of the ce- ramics also supported an early date for the Palace of the Stuccoes, his evidence, as he himself admit- ted, was somewhat tenuous. The latest sherds from the floors predating the second structure but postdating the Palace showed similarities to ceram- ics from Oxkintok, where an Initial Series date of 9.2.0.0.0 (a.d. 475) had been found on a lintel (Brainerd 195 1: 72). It is not known, however, if the Oxkintok ceramics are contemporaneous with the lintel, and the collections may date from as late as 9.8.0.0.0. (a.d. 593) (Brainerd 1958: 20). Fur- thermore, the time span between the Palace of the Stuccoes at Acanceh and the fill from which the samples were taken is also unknown. The presence of Teotihuacan ceramics, noted by Charnay in the main plaza mounds, was not mentioned by Brai- nerd in his description of the Acropolis samples. Andrews IV (1942: 258) cited the rough ma- sonry, spalled and thickly coated with plaster, the simple moldings, the use of stucco, and the ab- sence of veneer and mosaic stone designs as sup- port for his Early Period I date (Fig. 14). Andrews V, however, has recently dated the Palace of the Stuccoes in Early Period II, perhaps between a.d. 600-700 (Andrews and Andrews 1980: 146). 8 His suggested revision is based on observations of the architecture of Dzibilchaltun, about 40 km north of this correlation, particularly for the northern lowlands. For recent discussions of the controversy, see Andrews IV and Andrews V (1980: 275-285) and Kelley (1983). Related to and compounding this issue is the question of how much the Ter- minal Classic (Andrews' Pure Florescent) and the Early Post- Classic (Modified Florescent) Periods overlapped each other in Yucatan, particularly at the pivotal site of Chichen Itza. While most scholars now see at least some overlap between the two, others, notably Lincoln (1986), argue for total overlap, with no major ceramic or architectural disjunction between the two. The latter model also argues against the long-accepted idea of a Toltec invasion of Yucatan. Because of the prolifera- tion of terminology for phases in the northern lowlands and the general lack of agreement on dates, the chronology pro- posed by Andrews IV (1965) and modified by Andrews IV and Andrews V (1980) will generally be used here for the northern lowlands. For the rest of the Maya area and for Mesoamerica in general, Early Classic, Late Classic, Terminal Classic, and Post-Classic will be adopted. The term "Epiclas- sic" is defined in note 9 below. 8 Von Winning (1985: 10) also suggested an Early Period II date of a.d. 650-800 to the building, although he was appar- ently unfamiliar with the redating of the Palace by Andrews V.

Thompson, courtesy of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University. of Acanceh, which was excavated between 1956 and 1975. Brainerd (1958: 18-19) had already noted strong similarities between the ceramics of the two sites: he points out, for example, that Acanceh Red on Thin Gray ware is indistinguish- able to the eye from the same ware at Dzibilch- altun (produced during Brainerd's Regional pe- riod, ca. a.d. 200-700). The well-known Temple of the Seven Dolls (Str. 1 -sub), which shares some features with the Palace of the Stuccoes at Acanceh, has been dated about a.d. 700 (Andrews and Andrews 1980: 125) (Fig. 15). Both structures have sloping upper fa- cades covered with stucco decoration and framed by single-member rectangular moldings, in con- trast to the vertical upper facades, carved-stone decoration, and complex moldings of the Pure Florescent. Both upper facades display large stucco motifs which wrap around the corners of the facade: masks at Dzibilchaltun and giant birds at Acanceh. The same method for creating rough- ened surfaces in stucco, to be discussed below, is reported at both sites. Finally, both structures 15</page><page sequence="22">Fig. 15 Dzibilchaltun, Str. 1, south elevation. After Coggins 1983: fig. 7. were preserved by the construction of later build- ings over them. Nevertheless, the architectural and decorative similarities between Str. i-sub and the Palace of the Stuccoes are quite limited. At Dzibilchaltun, large stucco masks over the corners and door- ways of the temple are linked by intertwined ser- pentine bands studded with stylized aquatic mo- tifs (Fig. 15). The Acanceh frieze, on the other hand, displays rows of anthropomorphized and naturalistic birds and animals. Unlike other struc- tures at Dzibilchaltun and elsewhere in the Maya area where stucco decoration was brilliantly paint- ed, often in several colors, Str. i-sub was left white (Coggins 1983: 9). The few other remaining structures with upper facades in stucco in the northern lowlands are probably of Early Period I date, but for the most part are quite unlike either Dzibilchaltun or Acan- ceh (Andrews and Andrews 1980: 125). An Early Period structure at Mulchic in the Puuc region displays the remains of figures in stucco, for exam- ple (Pina Chan 1962: pl. 111). A five-room building at Yaxcopoil had an upper facade of polychrome stucco in deep relief, of which no description or illustration seems to exist (Andrews IV 1942: 260; Andrews V, personal communication, 1982). The recently discovered ruin of Xulha, Quintana Roo, includes a structure once ornamented with a stucco band of intertwined serpents and smaller anthropomorphic images enclosed within frames (Mayer 1987). A painted stucco frieze exhibiting Teotihuacan motifs - notably, framed stars bor- dered by lines suggesting water - has been found at Othon P. Blanco, Quintana Roo, and may pro- vide an important comparison for Acanceh (Cor- tes de Basdefer 1988). Other Early Period struc- tures that have painted stucco sculpture are dis- cussed by Kowalski (1985). The lack of appropriate architectural compari- sons, coupled with the limited archaeological data from the site, makes more precise dating of the Palace of the Stuccoes difficult. However, both the style and the iconography of the stucco facade support the proposed Early Period II construction date. 16</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 1 6 Character 20 (upper right). Note incised lines in plaster where the monkey's right arm has fallen away. Courtesy of the Peabody Museum, Harvard University. Material and Techniques of the Stucco Facade The roughly finished stones forming the fa- cade of the building were first coated with a thick layer of lime plaster. Although there is no remaining evidence for preparatory drawings be- neath the stucco reliefs, a photograph of the now- destroyed descending monkey shows that lines were scratched into the damp plaster to indicate the placement of limbs (Fig. 16, left arm). The figures were then modeled in stucco, some- times several centimeters thick, without a stone armature as is used, for example, at Palenque (Rob- ertson 1975). The creatures are sensitively mod- eled with rounded, fleshy limbs; volume is subtly suggested through varying depths of relief. Inte- rior details like costume elements and the shafts of feathers were incised into damp plaster. Breton (1908) first noted the unusual technique of using masses of stucco filled with chipped limestone flakes to imitate the texture of feathers (Fig. 17, character 14) and to form the odd turban-like head- dresses worn by characters 8 and 19 (Fig. 2, left; 17</page><page sequence="24">£ ' C/5 U I) &gt; s ~0 J-i rt &gt; t-i nj X S 2 &lt;/) 3 S o XI &lt;u CU CD 4-&gt; o &gt;&gt; C /i V u 3 O u oo 8. uT &lt;U 2 4&gt; X&gt; 0 £ &gt;s JO X Oh rt *-( O -4-&gt; o J3 CL. vo (S V) tH &lt;L&gt; 4-&gt; u t-l c« J3 u l&gt; bp £</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 1 6, left). The same technique is reported for the stucco decoration of Str. i-sub at Dzibilchaltun (Coggins 1983: 14-15) and appears to be unique to these two northern Maya sites. According to both early descriptions of the frienze and Adela Breton's watercolors, the facade was vividly painted, its colors preserved by white- wash, rubble, and later construction. Against a red background appear different hues of red, blue, green, yellow, brown, and white. Traces of color, notably red, blue or green, and possibly yellow, can still be seen. The application of the colors in flat washes without blending or the suggestion of modeling has been compared to mural painting of the same period at Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, and Uaxactun (Kowalski 1985: 55).</page><page sequence="26">CHAPTER 2 Description of the Stucco Frieze Introduction In theme and style, the frieze of the Palace of the Stuccoes is unlike any other extant architectural relief in the Maya area. Animals and birds domi- nate its iconographic program. Although animals are often featured in mythical scenes on Maya vases, in Classic sculpture and wallpainting they are rarely represented and always in secondary roles. Surviving architectural reliefs from the late Pre-Classic through the Late Classic, whether in stucco or stone, emphasize deity masks, human figures, and conventionalized symbols: only in the Post-Classic, at Chichen Itza, are specific ani- mals like jaguars and eagles introduced as signifi- cant sculptural motifs. The absence of animal im- agery in monumental form may, of course, be a result of accidents of preservation, particularly in the case of stucco and especially in the northern lowlands where stone replaced stucco as the fa- vored decorative material during the Pure Flores- cent period. A man and a deer can be seen on the Mulchic structure mentioned above, and at Kabah two large birds were modeled in stucco over an interior doorway (Stephens 1843, 1: fig. 24; Pol- lock 1980: 168-170). Nevertheless, Acanceh can be considered the single existing Classic Maya fa- cade displaying a procession of animals. A striking feature of the frieze pointed out by early observers is the representation of motifs strongly recalling central Mexican iconography (Seler 191 1; Spinden 191 3 : 213). The stucco relief has often been cited, in fact, as an example of Teotihuacan influence or even presence in the northern Maya lowlands (Proskouriakoff 1965: 475; Kubler 1984: 287; M. Coe 1987: 84; R. 20 Millon 1988: 128-129; Freer n.d.). On closer examination, however, it becomes evident that some of the alleged Teotihuacan elements have no counterparts at the highland site or have been so transformed that they resist cultural pigeon- holing. Nevertheless, the non-Maya quality of the frieze cannot be disputed, even if the sources and means of transmission of the foreign ele- ments remain unclear. While it is the unusual iconography of the stuc- co relief that has received the most attention in the past, other aspects deserve attention. To begin with, the use of modeled and painted stucco for architectural decoration is typically Maya, but the composition of the frieze is not. For example, the motifs represented are not arranged hierarchically with major and subordinate figures, nor is the most important element or scene placed over the central doorway. There is none of the sense of narrative that is found in most Maya figurative wallpainting, either. Instead, the characters are fac- ing in the same direction (east), recalling the ax- iality of animal processions on Maya vase paint- ing. Nevertheless, they are enclosed in frames which isolate them from one another and pre- clude narrative interaction among them. The use of frames, as well as the arrangement of anthropomorphic animals in rows across a wall surface, recalls Teotihuacan rather than Maya painting: the murals of Atetelco come to mind. But Teotihuacan painting is characterized by repe- tition or alternation rather than variety in the rep- resentation of human and animal forms: the indi- viduality of the figures here is more typical of</page><page sequence="27">Maya style. The naturalistic proportions of the characters, their seated positions, and their varied and human gestures are also Maya. As a result, the creatures do not appear to be merely static emblems frozen on the facade, but animated par- ticipants in a ritual procession. The facade's eclectic iconography and style may well represent a northern Maya manifestation of the cultural mix that characterizes much of Meso- american art and architecture during what has sometimes been called the Epiclassic period (ca. a.d. 700-900). 9 While it is particularly striking in its later phases at highland sites like Cacaxtla and Xochicalco, this cosmopolitanism can also be seen in the Maya area during the same period. Al- though for a long time the resemblance between Tula and Chichen Itza was viewed as the primary manifestation of central Mexican- Yucatecan inter- action, there is increasing evidence that the north- ern Maya enjoyed a continuing relationship with the central highlands, beginning at least as early as the Early Classic and continuing, with varying de- grees of intensity, through the Late Classic as well (V. Miller n.d.).10 Although the impact of Teotihuacan is more per- vasive and more dramatic at Kaminaljuyu and Tikal during the Early Classic, sites farther north also demonstrate ties with central Mexico in art and architecture. A well-known example is the re- markable ceramic cache from Becan consisting of a tripod vessel, possibly of highland Guatemalan 9 The concept of the Epiclassic was introduced by Jimenez Moreno (1966) and refined by Webb (1978). Several essays in Pasztory (1978) examine cross-cultural issues in Mesoamerica, but mostly of the Middle Classic period (a.d. 400-700) (Par- sons 1969), immediately preceding the Epiclassic. A recent collection of papers (Diehl and Berlo 1989) looks at develop- ments in Mesoamerica between the fall of Teotihuacan and the rise of Tula. While the editors of that volume reject the use of the term at all, preferring the unwieldy "Phase One of the Second Intermediate Period" (Diehl and Berlo 1989: 3), I feel that "Epiclassic" remains a useful concept. Cohodas (1989: 237), for example, uses it to separate the "final transformation of Classic period culture in Mesoamerica from the Terminal Classic period, in which Post-Classic patterns are initiated." Since the date of these changes varies from region to region (Teotihuacan collapsed well before Maya cities began to fall, for example), "Epiclassic" is a useful term for encompassing both the end of one period and the beginning of another. It is not only a time marker, but also a reference to the cosmopoli- tan nature of Mesoamerican interactions during this time. 10 See Pasztory 1988, note 1, for possible Late Pre-Classic Maya parallels with Teotihuacan architecture, architectural dec- oration, and site planning. origin (Ball 1977: 101), containing a Teotihuacan style hollow statuette within which were placed smaller figurines, all of which display at least some Teotihuacan characteristics. This cache, apparently of mid-sixth-century date, was deposited in the ruins of an elite residential compound over which a structure of possible talud-tablero construction was built (Ball 1979: 274). Other central highland products like obsidian had already appeared at the site by the third or fourth century (Ball 1977: 170). Another example of Early Classic central Mexi- can influence in the northern lowlands is the re- cently uncovered mural at Xelha which depicts a frontal figure, unmistakably if somewhat crudely painted in imitation of a Teotihuacan mural (Lom- bardo de Ruiz 1987: pl. 350). This painting has been dated stylistically to ca. a.d. 400-600, a date supported by Tzakol 2 ceramics found in a closed context within the building housing the mural (Perez and Toscano n.d.).11 Meanwhile, at Teotihuacan itself there is now evidence of imported Maya pottery, mostly of Early Classic date and largely from the northern Maya lowlands (Rattray n.d.; Ball 1983: 131, 137- 138). Very few Maya sherds of earlier or later peri- ods are present, and in general Teotihuacan re- sisted being influenced by Maya (or any other for- eign) art styles (cf. Nagao 1989: 98). The reappearance of Teotihuacan iconography in the Maya area during the decline and fall of that city has been noted around 9.13.0.0.0. (a.d. 692), the time of the proposed construction date of Acanceh's Palace of the Stuccoes. This "Mexi- canizing cultural renascence" is especially evident at Tikal but is also present at other lowland sites, including Dzibilchaltun (Coggins 1983: 41-43). Structure 612 at that site, originally a platform with an unvaulted superstructure, was rebuilt sometime in the early seventh century as a talud- tablero platform (Andrews IV and Andrews V 1980; 74). 12 Unlike other Mesoamerican talud- 11 The ceramic phases established for Uaxactun in the Peten that correspond to the Early and Late Classic are Tzakol 1, 2, and 3 and Tepeu 1, 2, and 3, with Tepeu 1 beginning about a.d. 600 (Smith and Gifford 1965: fig. 2). In the northern lowlands, Tzakol is approximately coeval with Early Period I, while Tepeu 1 and 2 are coeval with Early Period II. 12 For a discussion of the extension of talud-tablero architec- ture in both time and space, see Kowalski (n.d.). 21</page><page sequence="28">tablero constructions, which tend to deviate con- siderably from standard Teotihuacan proportions, this one has a talud-tablero ratio not far off the Teotihuacan average of 3:1. While it is the only excavated structure of this period at Dzibilchaltun to display talud-tablero construction, it has been suggested that further excavations might reveal others (Andrews V 1979: 243). Furthermore, evi- dence has been presented to suggest that the plan of Classic Dzibilchaltun, established around a.d. 700, is conceptually comparable to that of Teotihuacan (Coggins 1983: 60). Indeed, in the pe- riod following the introduction of central Mexican elements in Dzibilchaltun's architecture, there was a shift from the typical Maya orientation to the cardinal points to one of about 17 degrees east of north that corresponds more closely to central Mexican sites (Andrews V 1979: 244-245). The reasons for the revival of Teotihuacan ar- chitecture and imagery in lowland Maya art and architecture are still unclear. According to one theory, it represents a "cyclically determined reen- actment" of Early Classic Teotihuacan intrusions and calendrical innovations in the southern low- lands thirteen katuns earlier (Coggins 1983: 41). The evidence for the existence of a Maya-style calendar at Teotihuacan remains weak, however. Another hypothesis connects Teotihuacan iconog- raphy to a sacrificial bloodletting complex that is prevalent in Late Classic monumental sculpture (Scheie 1984: 30-33). While it cannot be deter- mined if the Palace of the Stuccoes was built in commemoration of katun 9.13.0.0.0, it will be demonstrated that bloodletting imagery is indeed present in the facade decoration. Teotihuacan iconography seems to come into play in the Maya Late Classic when local elites wish to separate themselves from their subjects and to engage in unpopular behavior, such as warfare and human sacrifice (Stone 1989). Since the absence of texts and ruler portraits at Acanceh precludes recon- structing its dynastic history, however, a political motivation for the creation of the stucco frieze remains an interesting speculation. Nevertheless, the combination of Teotihuacan imagery and bloodletting motifs at Acanceh may be the north- ern counterpart of similar juxtapositions in the art of southern Maya sites of the same epoch, such as Piedras Negras (cf. Stone 1989). Although the evidence is still scant, it has often been proposed that the Gulf Coast was the corri- dor through which Teotihuacan goods and ideas passed on their way to the Maya area. Recent excavations at the site of Matacapan in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz have revealed a substantial Teotihuacan presence as well as large quantities of Maya trade wares (Santley 1983: 77; Santley, Ortiz, and Pool 1987). In addition to lo- cally made copies of Teotihuacan ceramic types, at least one talud-tablero structure and what may be Teotihuacan style residential architecture are also found in the Teotihuacan barrio at the site. The central Mexican presence at the site appears to date from about a.d. 400-600 and was most likely motivated by trade considerations involv- ing imported obsidian, local stone for ground- stone tools, and nearby kaolin deposits (Santley, Ortiz, and Pool 1987: 46-47). While no other ex- cavated southern Gulf Coast sites display such a strong Teotihaucan presence, future explorations may provide more evidence for the passage of Teotihuacanos - or their ideology - through the area. The Palace of the Stuccoes at Acanceh seems to have been built well after the initial impact of Teotihuacan on the Maya area, however, during a period of locally determined adaptations of long- established central Mexican motifs and themes. By the end of the Epiclassic, if not sooner, Maya motifs and Maya style finally appear in central Mexican art, notably at Xochicalco and Cacaxtla, perhaps indicating a change in the political and economic balance between highlands and low- lands after the decline of Teotihuacan. The well- known Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent at the hilltop center of Xochicalco displays seated Maya lords who closely resemble those depicted on the so-called Nebaj jades found scattered throughout Mesoamerica (Fig. 18).^ But they have the elabo- rate speech scrolls that are diagnostic of highland cultures, and are seated within the undulating Adela Breton's watercolor of this panel can be seen in color in Giles and Stewart 1989, pl. 49. 22</page><page sequence="29">Fig. 1 8 Xochicalco, Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent. After V. Smith n.d.: fig. i. curves of a great feathered serpent. Here and on the three stelae at the site, central Mexican hiero- glyphs are used. The double outline typical of Classic Veracruz art may also be present in these reliefs. Although Xochicalco was apparantly only a "small urban center with regional, ceremonial, and administrative responsibilities" for an area in- cluding western Morelos and northern Guerrero (Hirth 1984: 585), its artists looked much farther afield and to the south and east for their sources. The unexpected find of the spectacular murals of Cacaxtla in Tlaxcala confirmed that the Maya played a much stronger role during the Epiclassic than had previously been suspected. Here, ethnic Maya clad in bird costumes fall in apparent defeat to jaguar-suited non-Maya in a battle scene remi- niscent of that of Bonampak in its frenzied move- ment and graphic detail (Fig. 19). This scene, as well as the portico murals in an adjoining build- ing, is painted in naturalistic Maya style but is accompanied by Teotihuacan motifs (such as Tla- loc faces) and unidentified hieroglyphs. While scholars continue to debate the ethnicity of the inhabitants of Cacaxtla and the participants in the murals, there can be no doubt that Maya painters, or at least artists trained by the Maya, were responsible for the paintings. Whether the murals were commissioned to lend legitimacy and prestige to a parvenu elite occupying Cacax- tla (D. McVicker 1985: 92), or as tribute de- manded from the Maya losers (Scheie and Miller 1986: 220; Nagao 1989: 99), they indicate that a strong relationship continued between central highland Mexico and the lowland Maya after the collapse of the Teotihuacan polity. Acanceh may well represent a southern manifestation of the en- during links between the two regions during the Epiclassic. The Moldings Decorative moldings in stucco or stone are a characteristic feature of northern Maya architec- ture. Projecting moldings with the remains of stucco ornamentation can still be seen on the con- temporaneous Str. 1 -sub at Dzibilchaltun, for ex- 23</page><page sequence="30">Fig. 19 Cacaxtla, Structure B, substructure, west talud.

Of the superior and medial moldings, only the former remains today. Breton left partly colored drawings of the design on the superior molding (Fig. 20; PI. 1) and of the now-destroyed lower one. The upper molding consists of a blue band incised with volutes, a symbol for water at Teoti- huacan and elsewhere.14 Abbreviated waterbands can also be seen on the neck pendants and wings of some of the characters below. From this band are suspended elaborately decorated oval objects, which have been identified as variations on the Teotihuacan eye-and-drop motif (von Winning 1947- 338). The oval drop is crossed by a wavy line, one of several infixes identified in drops rep- resented at Teotihuacan (Langley 1986: 247). Oth- ers (e.g., Freer n.d.) have seen these ovals as shells rather than drops. Despite their resem- blance to the Oliva shells frequently worn by Maya rulers depicted on stelae and reproduced in clay at Teotihuacan (von Winning 1987, 2, chap. 1: fig. 10b), they lack the conventional spiral at one end that identifies these shells. Feathered shells are represented at Teotihuacan, but the shells tend to be easily recognizable, more elabo- rate conches. The red, blue, and yellow fanlike ornament, possibly precious stones and feathers, that sur- rounds the drop is very like the headdresses worn by a number of the characters below: note, for example, the ornamentation around the rattle- snake's eye (Fig. 32, character 11). At Teotihuacan, the eye-and-drop motif often occurs in conjunction with, but separate from, the waterband (Fig. 21, but cf. von Winning 1947: fig. ik for a ceramic fragment in which the two are attached). It is occasionally ornamented, but never as elaborately as the Acanceh example. This waterband, then, is an excellent example of the adaptation and elaboration of a Teotihuacan motif in a Maya context, recalling the outer bor- der of the north portico mural at Cacaxtla which illustrates Teotihuacan water creatures depicted ^ Von Winning (1985: 13) suggests that this row of scrolls represents rain-bringing clouds. with Maya naturalism (D. McVicker 1985: 84, %• 3)- In Teotihuacan painting, waterbands appear as borders around murals and are painted on the frames of tableros. Water drops occur in many con- texts: flowing from hands, attached to streams, plants, and other objects, or as isolated motifs (Fig. 21). The two motifs presumably relate to rain, water, fertility, and abundance - important themes at Teotihuacan. The eye is probably ad- jectival, adding "shining," "brilliant," or some other attribute to the water. Von Winning suggests that the eye-and-drop corresponds to a Teoti- huacan feathered-eye glyph which he believes means spring (cf Spanish ojo de agua, which he reads as the Castilian translation of a Pre-Hispanic expression). The feathers are added to make it sa- cred water (von Winning 1987, 2: 70-71). Since feathers, jade, and other luxury materials are lav- ishly applied to serpents, jaguars, and other ani- mals and things, they must impart rank or some quality like "preciousness" to the thing repre- sented (Kubler 1967: 6, 9). The upper molding at Acanceh, then, symbolically depicts water as pre- cious, sacred, and beneficial.15 The medial molding is more recognizably Ma- ya, taking the form of a double-headed serpent (Fig. 3). 16 The body of the serpent is marked with two alternating signs: curving bands crossed over cross-hatched circles separated by three vertical bands from a disk with a center hole. The last motif most closely resembles the Maya glyphic prefix po ("mat" in Maya and part of the honor- ific title ah po "he of the mat") (Lounsbury 1973). The upper and lower borders of the molding were painted blue, as were the crossed bands and the disks. The vertical bands separating the signs Von Winning (198$: 36, fig. 41) describes the band as representing "the face of a deity peering from the sky, symbol- izing the celestial aspect of Itzam Na as the bringer of the rains." There is, however, nothing to link these symbolic eye- and-drop motifs specifically to Itzamna or any other Maya deity. 16 Nevertheless, the idea of serpent-as-frame is also present at Teotihuacan, on the miniature temple of Atetelco, for exam- ple (A. Miller 1973: figs. 346-349). A mural without prove- nience exhibits painted feathered serpents undulating over a series of trees (Berrin 1988: pls. iA-F). From their jaws pour liquid streams marked with the wave motif as well as the eye- and-drop motif. 25</page><page sequence="32">were yellow with a red band in the center, while the background and the centers of both signs were painted red. While the motifs represented are like those appearing on Maya skybands, this particular combination seems to be unique. 17 Fur- thermore, unlike the simple crossed bands usually represented in skybands, these enclose red, cross- hatched circles like those shown in the containers just below the superior molding (Fig. 32). Although by the time Seler's drawing was made the western serpent head had disappeared, the upside-down eastern one was still visible.18 Ac- cording to Seler's rendition (Fig. 3), it has a large round eye, half-covered by the striated membrane commonly seen in Maya serpents, surmounted by a supraorbital plate ending in a curl behind the eye. This curl is echoed by the larger scroll below that emerges from or frames the back of the mouth. Seler's drawing of the snout and jaw is not entirely clear, although he interprets it as another skyband wrapping around the corner of the building (Seler 17 For the motifs represented in Maya skybands, see Collea (1981) and Carlson and Landis (1985). 18 A photograph in the Peabody Museum photoarchives shows the remains of the back of the western serpent's head- dress. Cf. von Winning 1985: fig. 9, probably drawn from the same photograph. Fig. 21 Teotihuacan, Zacuala patios, Room 2, Mural 5. Detail of eye-and-drop motif. After A. Miller 1973: fig. 226. 191 1 : 1016). What appears to be the beginning of a row of teeth is just visible beneath the snout, at the edge of the damaged area at the corner of the struc- ture (Fig. 3). The lower jaw and the snout are covered with what look like a net design, somewhat like the twined netting commonly worn by felines repre- sented in Teotihuacan art (Fig. 22). I know of no other examples of netted serpents in either Maya or Teotihuacan art, however, and it is unfortunate that Breton did not leave a drawing of the serpent head. In a recent dissertation, David Brown (n.d.: 257 ff) has attempted to demonstrate that the repre- sentation of netted jaguars at Teotihuacan is based on both a stylization of the cat's pelt markings and a complex of homophonous and synonymous words related to "net" and "jaguar" in Maya, the language he believes was spoken at Teotihuacan. Whether or not his argument proves correct, it is indeed true that, for the Maya, jaguars and snakes are more closely linked iconographically and lin- guistically than might be expected.19 In Tzeltal, for example, the taxonomic term chanbalam (one trans- lation of which is "snake/jaguar") refers to animals 19 See Bacon 1979 for a discussion of the linguistic relation- ship between jaguars and serpents in Maya languages. 26</page><page sequence="33">Fig. 22 Teotihuacan, Zone n, Portico 5, Mural 5. Detail of netted feline. After A. Miller 1973: fig. 152. in general, and more specifically to most mam- mals (excluding humans, bats, and armadillos) (Hunn 1977: 134). In Yucatec, an unidentified spe- cies of snake is called balamchan (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 32). Perhaps the best example of the visual conflation of both animals can be found at Cacaxtla, where a spotted serpent/jaguar provides an animated frame for a lord dressed in a jaguar costume (D. McVicker 1985: fig. 3). The serpent also wears a headdress that recalls Teotihuacan rather than Maya costume design: that is, the headdress and the projection behind it are broken up into small geometric segments that might represent short, cropped feathers, plaques of jade, or other precious materials forming a mo- saic pattern (cf. Fig. 22). The same kind of head- dress is worn by a number of the creatures de- picted below (cf. Fig. 28, character 3). Photo- graphs and drawings from Andrews' work in 1942 (after the serpent's jaw had been destroyed) provide a few details that clarify Seler's earlier rendition (Fig. 13, far left; Fig. 23). The interior of the projecting motif at the back of the head is partly cross-hatched, for example, and there are small triangles incised in the supraorbital plate. What may be an extension of the headdress or a jeweled noseplug (cf Fig. 32, character 11) can also be seen in this photograph, turning the cor- ner of the building. Despite the unusual features of this serpent, it is clearly yet another version of the double-headed sky creature that appears in many contexts in Clas- sic Maya art. Since can/chart, "snake," and caan/ chart, "sky," are homonyms in Maya, the sky is often represented by a serpent. Normally, the skyband is placed above or arched over a terrestrial scene, although basal examples are not unknown. Von Winning (1985: 15), following J. Eric Thomp- son in emphasizing Itzamna as the central Maya deity, interprets this band as the floor of the house of Itzamna. While the Maya pantheon is now gen- erally considered to be more complex than Thomp- son's quasi-monotheistic view would allow, the idea of the skyband functioning as the floor of the Maya universe does have precedents. The now- destroyed figure of Naranjo Stela 32, for example, is enthroned on a series of stacked skybands alter- nating with bands marked with water-lily ( naab ) pads; a metaphor for sky and lake (also naab), or surface of the earth (Scheie n.d) (Fig. 24). In Maya architecture, a stucco or stone skyband may function as a frame, as at Palenque on the piers of the Temple of the Inscriptions (Robertson 1983: pl. 27) and edging the roofcomb of the Tem- ple of the Sun (Robertson 1979: pl. 9-2), or as a base for a seated figure, as on the facade of the east wing of the Monjas at Chichen Itza (Maudslay 1889-1902, 3: pl. 1). Most comparable to the 27</page><page sequence="34">Fig. 23 Medial molding, northeast corner. Photograph by E. W. An- drews IV, 1942, courtesy of the Peabody Museum, Harvard Univer- sity.

Although the stucco decoration of this building is largely gone, the remains of various sky motifs, most notably a crossed-band element, can still be seen (Pender- gast 1982: figs. 27-29). The building, which housed an important tomb and was covered by later construction, has been dated to the second half of the sixth century (Pendergast 1982: 136). The two moldings, then, provide a kind of "bi- cultural" frame for the characters represented on the facade: the upper, derived perhaps from Teotihuacan wallpainting, and the lower, repre- senting an essentially Maya concept.20 The Corner Motifs The upper facades of northern Maya buildings traditionally terminate at the corners in large deity masks, usually of the Maya rain god Chac. At Acanceh, however, the masks are replaced by large stucco birds spanning the area between the superior and medial moldings. These birds, whose bodies wrapped around the corner of the building, framed the frieze and at the same time visually turned the corner of the building, perhaps leading the viewer to other stucco-decorated facades. Al- though by the time Seler recorded the frieze the western bird was gone, Breton did draw both as they appeared in 1907. The better preserved of the two is reproduced here (Fig. 25; PI. 2). The west- ern bird appears to have been essentially the same, according to Breton's watercolor and an unpub- lished photograph in the archives of the Peabody Museum. Each bird has massive, raptorial claws that seem to perch on the serpent heads of the medial mold- ings below. While the breast feathers are indicated naturalistically by limestone flakes placed in wet stucco, the wing, ending in bright green feathers, is ornamental. It is outlined with a thick blue dou- ble border. A wider band crosses the wing, a large curl suspended from its center. Below this a curv- 20 Coggins (1983: 42-43, note 14) points out that the biceph- alic serpent occurs only at Teotihuacan between its appear- ances at Izapa and in the Early Classic Maya art of Tikal, citing the second-century Temple of Quetzalcoatl as a possible source for its reintroduction into the Maya area.

After Marquina 195 1: pl. 213. ing cartouche, marked by the same wave motif as appears in the upper molding of the frieze, en- closes a cross-hatched, red triangle. This motif, and the three cross-hatched ovals above, are in lower relief than the elements that frame them. Small yellow or cream ovals, drops perhaps, hang from the waterband over a cropped fringe of white feathers. The missing heads and stylized wings make iden- tification of the birds difficult. Marquina (195 1 : 803) refers to them as eagles and reconstructs the heads to accommodate his interpretation (Fig. 12). The reconstruction appears to be based on the upward-looking head of character 10 below (Fig. 32), however, as there was no evidence for the appearance of the birds' heads even at the time of the facade's discovery. Since the birds represented on the frieze tend to be hybrids, the corner bird may well have been one of the mythical avians common in Maya iconography, such as the katun bird or the muan bird. These birds may appear perched on world trees, or their heads are placed frontally in the center of skybands (Scheie 1976: figs. 6, 7, 9, 10, 12). But in at least one example, Naranjo Stela 32, profile bird heads appear at ei- ther end of a skyband on which a ruler is seated (Fig. 24). These, then, may be larger versions of these celestial birds. The Framing Cartouches Each character is framed by a stepped cartouche outlined in two bands of color, usually alternating, and including green, blue, red, and yellow. Von Winning (1985: 7) provides a useful chart of the colors used, pointing out that there is no consistent pattern to the color choices. Each cartouche mea- sures 55-58 cm in height, but at the base the lower cartouches tend to be wider, averaging 84 cm to the 74 cm width of the upper cartouches. The lower borders around the characters are missing, however, so that no figure is completely contained within the semiquatrefoil shape. These overlap- ping, inverted T-shaped elements create a rhyth- mic pattern of line and color across the facade's surface. A similar pattern is created by the overlap- ping scalloped motifs appearing in one Teotihua- can mural (Fig. 21). At Acanceh, the outer band is in slightly higher relief than the inner, further sepa- rating the two colors, if present, and relieving the flatness of the frames. In several cartouches some part of the character is covered by the frame, call- ing attention to its presence and adding interest to the repetitive parade of figures. It is typically Maya to ignore the constraints of a frame. The use of this inverted T-shape on a monu- mental scale and as an overlapping framing device seems to be unique in Maya art. The closest equivalent could be the recessed niches that proba- 30</page><page sequence="37">bly once supported three-dimensional sculpture on the facade of Yaxchilan Structure 33 (Fig. 26). These stepped semiquatrefoils could have served as stylized open mouths of now-missing monster faces tenoned above (Tate n.d.: 363). Outside the Maya area, a resemblance between the Acanceh frames and Zapotec tableros has been noted (von Winning 1985: 17-18). They, too, have double moldings with a protruding exterior frame that serves to create interesting light and shade effects on the surface below. But these tableros do not normally serve as enclosing frames nor are they combined with modeled reliefs, so the resem- blance is probably fortuitous. The inverted T-shaped cartouche recalls the symbols for mountain or cave used throughout Mesoamerica. The Zapotec toponym, for exam- ple, is a flattened inverted T, affixed with the locality's name. At Teotihuacan, three overlap- ping pointed or rounded arcs also may stand for hill or mountain (cf. von Winning 1985: figs. 10- 12). Three stepped elements similar to those repre- sented in the Acanceh frieze are combined to form a small mountain symbol on a Maya Tzakol 3 vessel in Teotihuacan style (M. Coe 1982: no. 28), but this symbol is rare in Classic Maya art. Cave openings or entrances to sacred places can also be T-shaped, beginning at least as early as Olmec times, as demonstrated in the well-known rock carvings of Chalcatzingo. Monument 9 in particular (Grove 1984: fig. 8) resembles the Acanceh cartouches, particularly those of the up- per tier which are formed by two T shapes, one inverted on top of the other, which is created by the edges of the lower frames. The opening is sometimes transformed into the open jaws of an animal or monster, as at Chalcat- zingo and in Chenes and Rio Bee doorways. The so-called ik (wind, breath, or life in Maya) win- dows, unique to Palenque, might also be com- pared with the cave or entrance symbol. These niches and windows are usually positioned so that the T is right-side up. In the subterranean cham- bers of the Palace, however, the ik windows are upside down, symbolic perhaps of the suggested mortuary functions of these rooms (Peterson 1985: 26). The Acanceh cartouches may be similar to the reversed ik openings of Palenque, making reference to the underworld or to rituals of death. The cartouches also echo the cut-away profiles of stepped pyramids - clearly analogous to moun- tains throughout Mesoamerica - here covering over or containing the animals within.21 At Teoti- huacan, a similar stepped motif - a flat, painted stone or terracotta piece called an almena - is be- lieved to have served as a vertical accent on flat roofs (Pasztory, catalogue entry in Berrin 1988: 183). Based on the available evidence, then, the car- touches may refer to hills or mountains, caves or subterranean places, entrances to sacred enclo- sures, or cross sections of pyramids. The Vessels Between each of the upper cartouches is an ob- ject that Seler, basing his identification on central Mexican codices, believed to be a bowl holding a down-ball and a feather (191 1: 1017-18) (Fig. 32; -PL 4). Seler also brought in the very similar de- sign on the wings of the birds below as proof that the bowls were filled with down, although the wing patterns can hardly be seen as naturalistic representations of feathers (cf. Fig. 2$, character 16). The squat shape of the bowl, its everted rim, and the X-ray view of the contents recall contain- ers represented in Teotihuacan art (e.g., Sejourne 1959: fig. 120). Similar vessels appear individually or in front of seated deities in Mixtec codices as well. In the Codex Nuttall (Fig. 27), for example, a liquid- filled container depicted in X-ray view that repre- sents the day-sign water forms the name glyph 2 Water of the seated figure at right. The Codex Fejer vary-Mayer (1967: pls. 10, 23) includes repre- sentations of numerous X-ray containers, some of which appear to contain a ball of copal, a tied bundle of wood, and sometimes a feather-like pro- jection at the top. The red color that appears on objects within the vessels could conceivably repre- sent blood. Among the epithets for the divine grandparents 21 I thank Elizabeth Boone for pointing out the resemblance of the cartouches to pyramids. 31</page><page sequence="38">Fig. 27 Codex Nuttall, detail of seated figures. Note vessel in x-ray view between them. After Codex Nuttall 1975: 32. in the Popol Vuh (now the patrons of Quiche day keepers or diviners) is "maker of the blue- green bowl"; by extension this may also refer to those who make and tend shrines, which are to- day lined with pieces of pottery (Tedlock 1985: 348, 369). Indeed, the bowl may stand for both earth and sky, since the same term raxa is used to refer to the green landscape and the blue sky (Tedlock 1985: 58, 348). The horizontal blue band-and-curl motif within the vessel, previously seen on the wing of the cor- nice bird, probably represents water. The red, cross-hatched circles at the bottom of the bowl almost certainly stand for blood. In Maya relief sculpture, figures undergoing auto-sacrifice some- times hold containers filled with papers marked with the same motif. This vessel, then, contains the two most precious liquids, water and blood. The yellow so-called "down-ball" might then be a mate- rial for absorbing blood, such as the woven grass balls used by the Mexica. The protruding element at the top of this material, while superficially resem- bling a feather, is quite unlike any of those shown on the birds represented in the frieze; in fact, as von Winning (1985: 36) points out, it looks more like the tail of character 3, a squirrel (Fig. 28). He be- lieves that the contents of the bowl represent a squirrel pelt The tail-like element is more likely some kind of bloodletting implement such as a sting-ray spine or obsidian blade, although it ap- pears to be of the same material as the vessel's contents, and it is bent rather than straight like most perforators. The line-and-dot marks on both yel- low elements are similar to those on T563 and T630, both read logographically as "fire" by most epigraphers, but the absence of curling smoke often associated with both the "fire" glyphs and burning censers depicted in Maya art would indicate that these vessels do not contain fire or burning incense, as suggested by von Winning (1985: 36). The Characters Of the twenty-one characters once covering the upper facade of the Palace of the Stuccoes, fourteen were complete and six were at least partially in place at the time of the building's discovery (Fig. 3). The upper register includes birds, a bat, a spider mon- key, and the single human figure appearing in the frieze. Early photographs of the frieze, as well as one drawing of it (Fig. 13c), show what may be the remnants of feathers just above character 1 , suggest- ing that there may have been another bird in the upper row (cf. von Winning 1985: fig. 15). Marquina's rendition (Fig. 12a), in fact, adds two complete framed panels at either end of the upper register and two partial ones in the lower, allowing for at least two more characters in the higher zone. Von Winning's (1985: fig. 41) chart of the panels also suggests the existence of two more framed birds at each end of the frieze. Close study of the facade itself, as well as early photographs, however, indicates that there was probably not enough space available for these additional frames. The animals of the lower tier tend to be terres- trial: there are frogs, snakes, rodents, a feline, and a howler monkey. All the recognizable animal and bird species represented are or were native to the Yucatan peninsula. Most have the anthropomor- phic features characteristic of fauna represented in Maya art, including clothing, headdresses, jew- elry, and the postures of humans. Certain differences can be noted between the two rows of characters. The birds tend to be hy- brids: all have raptorial claws but varied heads and plumage. Even the bat is partly human, or may represent a human impersonator (Fig. 32, char- 32</page><page sequence="39">x&gt; u o 8 s u rt ° 0 rt S X '3 ^ td o o oo ^ • 1-H £ OO • 1-H OO :2 2 C OO 3 &lt;* -H &lt;D 4) l/i »-( 3 •sS -ri T3 " -ri T3 -j-i fa £ T3 © 8 ~ £ u 0 u 2 £ &lt;£3 O ^ 1 5r 1 (L&gt; I- I 4-1 t-l ft o is u &lt;« - &lt;« ^ £ rt O U £ oo ® &lt;s j* • "o3 W)T3 £ &lt;</page><page sequence="40">Fig. 29 Examples of the uinal glyph. After Thompson i960: fig. 27. acter 8). The animals of the lower tier, although anthropomorphized, are single-species rather than polymorphic. They also tend to be more seden- tary, restrained in part by the squatter dimensions of their cartouches, while the characters above them are in movement: they move their limbs or wings as if walking or flying, or twist and turn as if trying to escape the bonds of the enclosing niches. Of the lower creatures with paws, most gesture with the right paw toward the eastern end of the frieze, the same direction most of the charac- ters face. The gesture is similar to the so-called "scattering" gesture made by the Maya elite repre- sented in the act of auto-sacrifice, as blood flows from their hands; but it might also be compared with the animated and graceful gestures of convers- ing figures as in the Bonampak murals and on many painted vessels. What is lacking here, of course, is a sense of discourse between individuals. Character 1 As Seler recognized, the first character is a frog or toad with reptilian markings on its limbs and webbed feet, visible on the left foot of the animal (Fig. 28; PL 3). 22 The curl at the corner of the mouth and the serrated teeth, while not traits of real frogs and toads, are Maya conventions in the 22 Von Winning (1985: 19) mistakes characters 1 and 17 for jaguars, apparently basing his identification less on the physi- cal characteristics of the animals than on the presence of what he believes are knotted neckbands, which are sometimes worn by jaguars represented in vase painting. representations of these animals.23 Both features are visible in the head form of the uinal (20-day period) glyph (Fig. 29). This animal also wears a knotted loincloth, a headdress, neck pendant, and bracelets and anklets. The eye is ringed, as it is on several other figures on the frieze. From the frog's mouth emerges a curving, tabbed speech scroll, and with its right "hand" the figure gestures as if emphasizing a verbal point. Both the speech scroll and the ringed eye are acknowledged to be central Mexican motifs, and during the Classic period are strongly associated with Teotihuacan. They do occur in Classic Maya art as well, however. Speech scrolls appear in Oaxaca as early as Monte Alban II (ca. 200 B.C.- a.d. 100), and tabbed speech scrolls like those at Acanceh can be seen on reliefs at Monte Alban dating from Monte Alban Ilia (ca. a.d. 200-450). The significance of the tabs, which are also pres- ent on Teotihuacan speech scrolls, is unknown, but presumably they serve adjectival or adverbial functions, modifying the speaker's words. Eye rings are one of the identifying features of the central Mexican rain deity Tlaloc. They also occur, however, on the faces of other deities, hu- mans, birds, and insects (Klein 1976: 206). The wide distribution of such rings in time and space, as well as the variety of contexts in which they 23 In a recent analysis of Olmec toad iconography, Furst (1981: 160) suggests that the curls represented on Mesoamer- ican toad images depict the last of the dead skin that is swal- lowed by the animal during moulting. 34</page><page sequence="41">appear, suggests that they do not refer to rain at all. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the word Tlaloc (more correctly, Tlalloc) means "he who has the quality of earth" (Sullivan 1974). Zelia Nuttall (1891: 29) proposed long ago that the goggles may refer to special powers of vision, and it has been suggested that the rings are perfo- rated mirrors, giving the wearer such powers (Klein 1976: 213). More recently, David Brown (n.d.: 180), noting the presence of a distinctive pattern of "eyes" on the lower hindwings of the large tropical owl butterfly, has suggested that this is the source of the goggle-eye motif in Teoti- huacan art. The same butterfly is also known as the jaguar butterfly because of its unusual noctur- nal feeding hours, similar to those of the jaguar. The frog (character 1), the bat (character 8), the feline (character 13), and the gopher (character 19) are all noted for their nocturnal activities and wear the eye rings. Two of the birds - perhaps noctur- nal hunters or sharp-eyed birds who spot their prey from great heights - also have eye rings (char- acters 10 and 14). Nevertheless, the pairing of ani- mal and eye rings is not always consistent: char- acter 17, also a frog or toad, does not have them, for example. The eye rings have also been identified as possi- ble symbols of darkness and death (Klein 1976: 207; von Winning 1987, 1: 120), and if the sur- rounding niches stand for caves or entrances to the underworld, the goggled animals might be seen as dead or supernatural creatures. But again, this explanation does not account for those with- out the eye rings, nor is it consistent with Maya death imagery. Teotihuacan-derived motifs like Tlaloc goggles rarely occur in isolation in Maya art, but are al- most always present as part of a complex of several Teotihuacan elements that may occur in various combinations. At Acanceh, the eye ring and the speech scroll are only two of the motifs repre- sented that can be linked directly or indirectly with the art of Teotihuacan. These foreign elements - Tlaloc, speech scrolls, short-feather headdresses, year-signs, and other motifs - seem to be con- nected with Maya sacrifice, but the reasons for this link, as well as the mode of transmission between highland Mexico and the Maya lowlands, remain poorly understood (Scheie 1984). The relationship between anurans and rainfall is well documented in Maya myth and ethnographi- cal accounts. Frogs, for example, are thought to announce rain with their croaking (Thompson 1970: 258). What is less well-known about frogs and toads is their ritual use in Pre-Hispanic times. It remains difficult to prove that bufo marinus was used psychotropically, as several scholars have suggested (e.g., Dobkin de Rios 1974), but the large number of frog and toad bones deposited in burials at Cozumel, as well as a few elsewhere, cannot be overlooked (Hamblin 1984: 50-51). Clearly, anurans had a ritual significance that tran- scended their role as harbingers of rain. Character 2 Of the first character in the upper register, only the tail feathers, claws, and tips of the wing feath- ers survived after the frieze was uncovered (Fig. 28; PI. 3). Held in the unidentified bird's raptorial claws, however, are trilobal motifs whose red color leaves little doubt that they stand for drip- ping blood. Other contexts in which the motif occurs, both in the Acanceh frieze and elsewhere in Mesoamerican art, confirm this identification. The trilobal motif has long been recognized as a symbol for liquid, with color and context deter- mining whether water or blood is represented (von Winning 1947; Sejourne 1959: 124, fig. 125). 2* Although it occurs throughout Mesoamer- ica from the Late Pre-Classic through the Early Post-Classic, it is most strongly associated with the art of Teotihuacan and Tula, where it is repre- sented dripping from human hearts. Toltec art, for example, often features an eagle clutching a bleeding heart or drops of blood in its claws, a theme largely limited to the Post-Classic (Heyden 1987: fig. 17; Diehl 1983: pl. 15). 25 At Cacaxtla, 24 A good discussion of this triple-drop motif, with illustra- tions, can be found in Heyden (1987: 121 ff). 25 According to a contemporary Tzeltal story, the harpy eagle collects gold from the foot of a cross at the bottom of the sea. Its color is perceived as red rather than gold (Stross 1985: 77). Perhaps for the Tzeltal, the most precious Pre- Conquest liquid, blood, was replaced metaphorically by the European one, gold. 35</page><page sequence="42">Fig. 30 Maya vase with cormorants and treble scroll motif, detail. After Kerr 1989: file no. 1698. however, a site whose murals display strong Maya influence, a blue bird, possibly a quetzal, holds a red trilobe in its beak (Foncerrada de Mo- lina 1982: fig. 12). A Teotihuacan bird from a mural at Tetitla also holds a more elaborate ver- sion of the motif in its beak (Pasztory, catalogue entry in Berrin 1988: fig. vi.nb). Between the body and tail feathers of character 2 appears another Mesoamerican symbol for liquid, the so-called "treble scroll" (Neys and von Win- ning 1946). Although like the trilobed motif it was first identified in central Mexico, it appears to have been a more widespread symbol, occurring in Clas- sic Maya art in contexts without Teotihuacan asso- ciations. What the design actually represents is not clear, although a cross-section of a shell has been suggested (Thompson i960: 278). In Maya art, at least, it indicates watery realms and their inhabit- ants, whether animal or supernatural (Fig. 30). Tre- ble scrolls mark the water's surface on the well- known canoe-scene bones from Tikal and the body of a fish caught in a waterbird's beak on a cylinder vessel from the same site (Coggins 1975: figs. 88, 112-115). Closer to Acanceh, themotifis shown attached to intertwined streams on the fa- cade of Dzibilchaltun's Str. i-sub, which features aquatic motifs (Fig. 15). While the placement of the treble scroll on a bird's body may be unique in Maya iconography, it does occur in the same position on raptorial birds represented in mural fragments from Teoti- huacan (Fig. 31 and A. Miller 1973: figs. 361, 363; Berrin 1988: pls. 17, 18, 20). 26 As at Acanceh, the center portion of the motif is red and the border blue, perhaps in reference to the two most sacred liquids, water and blood. At Teotihuacan, in fact, drops may be shown falling from this motif (von Winning 1987, 2, chap. 1: fig. 5). Above the tre- ble scroll on the Acanceh bird is a knotted bow whose significance will be discussed in relation- ship to character 10. Finally, at Xochicalco, a site which, like Cacaxt- la, shows evidence of Maya influence in its art, blue treble scrolls adorn the body of the undulat- ing serpents on the talud of the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent (Fig. 18), as well as on the supe- rior molding of the tablero above on the western facade of the building (not shown here).27 Here, perhaps, the symbol may stand for rain-bringing clouds, transforming Quetzalcoatl into Mixcoatl, the Cloud Serpent.28 The Acanceh birds, then, may also be marked as messengers of rain clouds. Character 3 This may be a squirrel, given its rodent-like 26 Brown (n.d.: 153 ff) believes this bird, often identified as a quetzal, is a great curassow, admitting, however, that the green plumage depicted does not conform to that of the curassow. Pasztory (catalogue entry in Berrin 1988: 165) sees green birds represented at Teotihuacan as mythical creatures combining the attributes of more than one species. 27 Adela Breton s watercolor of the eastern wall of the Pyra- mid of the Feathered Serpent is reproduced in Giles and Stew- art 1989: pl. 40. 28 In a recent dissertation on Xochicalco (V. Smith n.d.: 390-39i)» the author sees the serpent as a version of the Cipactli monster, embodying water, blood, fertility, and the earth, as well as serving as the site's tutelary deity. 36</page><page sequence="43">Fig. 3 1 Teotihuacan mural fragment of unknown provenience: bird. Note treble scroll at tail. After Miller 1973: fig. 363. features and bushy tail (Fig. 28; PL 3). With the possible exception of a panel from the Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itza (Roys 1933: pl. ib), however, squirrels are not represented in Maya monumental art. The animals themselves are, or at least were, quite common not far from Acan- ceh at Chichen Itza (Allen and Chapman 1897: 7). If unimportant iconographically, the squirrel is by no means absent from Maya texts. A possible squirrel-head hieroglyph, read cuc, has been identi- fied and appears as the main sign in the name of the important Naranjo ruler Smoking Squirrel (Kelley 1962: 282-283). According to the Chilam Balam of Chumayel (Roys 1933: 69, footnote 5), one of the greatest Maya men was called Ah Mex Cuc, or whiskered squirrel. Ku'uk (Yucatec) also refers to the katun cycle, or period of 20 tuns or years (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 346; von Winning 1985: 20). Thomas Barthel (cited in von Winning 1985: 20, 36) interprets the squirrel as symboliz- ing the revolution of katun cycles (20-year periods in the Maya calendar), referring here to an impor- tant katun ending at Acanceh. No similar use of this motif is known in Maya art, however. This squirrel, like the frog, sits up like a human and gestures with both forepaws. Its small head- dress is worn behind the ear, and the segmented pattern is repeated in its bracelets and anklets. Just below the character's short beard is a blue bar pendant marked with the curl motif that probably indicates water. Character 4 This is another bird, of which only the wings, tail feathers, and parts of the beak and claws re- mained when fireton copied the frieze (Fig. 28; PI. 3). The bird appears to have been perched on the outer edge of character 3's frame, head tilted back and one wing stretched up, the other down. The bird's elongated, blunt beak is visible just above another waterband collar. The elaborate design of the wings is very similar to that of the large corner bird (Fig. 25) and is repeated, with variations, on the wings of the remaining birds. Below, and covered by this design, are the more naturalistic tail feathers of the bird. Character 5 This animal was in fragmentary condition when uncovered, and no existing photograph or draw- ing helps to identify it (Fig. 28; PL 3). In Breton's watercolor the remaining portions look like a tail or feather (lower left) and the open jaws of an animal with protruding tongue(?), upper teeth, furry beard, and jeweled noseplug. If this interpre- 2* This small detail would indicate that the bird is probably not an eagle, as suggested by von Winning (1985: 29). 37</page><page sequence="44">i 2 &lt;u £ |x . o &lt;u ^ &lt;S C nJ C/i 'Q .. 00 T3 M U 00 is 0 II C3 P4 C3 P4 o pq m B £ » o 3 4-J ct O tt -r *G 2 « c c o rt ^ T3 .£ •rt &lt;u s -5 3 ^ ^ 3 ^ &lt;/i -A &amp; -A 13 £ •5 3 -O o . . o V ^ vL 2 e K £ ® tj ftf 2 3 -2&lt; u &gt;, &lt;S J2 ^ n $&gt;■§ s U- o u</page><page sequence="45">tation is correct, however, the creature would have been facing west, unlike the other remaining char- acters who face east.30 Character 6 This character is completely absent from Seler's drawing, but Breton's shows the remains of green feathers at the upper right and a claw-like dangling element at the upper left (Fig. 32; PL 4). Character 7 This character is more complete in Seler's draw- ing than in Breton's (Fig. 32; PL 4). Its arms are extended upwards as if supporting the enclosing cartouche: the pose recalls that of the Bacabs, the Maya directional gods placed at the four corners of the earth to hold up the sky. Its feet resemble the webbed feet of characters 1 and 17. The creature's head appears to face east, as indicated by the promi- nent eye and part of a nose or beak. Three vertical elements, feathers perhaps, are framed by the fig- ure's upraised arms. Character 8 The animal represented here is clearly an anthro- pomorphic leaf-nosed bat (Fig. 32; PL 4), a crea- ture often depicted on polychrome vases from the Chama region and strongly associated with the Maya underworld (Fig. 33). The Chama bats, how- ever, are usually represented with the body in a frontal position with outstretched wings, often covered with signs for death. This bat is in profile, with the back leg bent as if walking, and the wing membranes relatively naturalistic, terminating in slender fingers.31 At the upper edges of the wings are signs that may be kan crosses. Although kan means "yellow" in Maya, the kan symbol has been given multiple associations that range from blue, water, turquoise, precious (Thompson i960: 275- 30 The one remaining exception is character 14 (Fig. 32), whose head is turned to the west but whose body and feet face east. 31 A recently published, unprovenienced Maya vase, how- ever, includes a chubby anthropomorphic leaf-nosed bat with a disembodied eye standing in profile, among other half- human, half-animal participants (Kerr 1989: file no. 1440). Bats are also depicted on other pots in this volume (file nos. 1490 and 1901). Fig. 33 Chama area, Guatemala, vase, detail of bat. After M. Coe 1973: no. 12. 276), to red, fire, the sun (Stross 1985), and blood (Stuart 1988: 182). The red, bifurcating scroll emerging from the bat's mouth is a consistent attri- bute of Maya bats. While it has been described as a speech scroll, flame, or smoke, it more likely depicts flowing blood. Bats represented on Maya pots often have other attributes of death, such as disembodied eyes, and the "snatch-bats" of Xi- balba, their snouts like knives, decapitated one of the Hero Twins, Hunahpuh, during the brothers' trials in the underworld (Tedlock 1985: 143). Bats are associated with human sacrifice, particularly decapitation, throughout Mesoamerica, in fact (Thompson 1966: 180). The aquatic functions at- tributed to the bat by von Winning (1985: 30) are not supported by either Maya iconographic or eth- nographic sources. The ringed eyes and short beard are attributes shared with several of the other animals. The bat wears a two-piece blue earplug, a blue necklace with a white pendant, and an unusual puffy tur- ban, formed by placing stone flakes in wet stucco. Turbans occur occasionally in Maya art, some- times on rulers depicted on stelae but more often on attendants represented on vases or on figurines (e.g., Scheie and Miller 1986: fig. v. 4, pl. 31). It 39</page><page sequence="46">Fig. 34 Howler monkey (Alouatta palliata). After Leo- pold 1959: fig. 123. has been suggested that the material forming the headdresses of this character and the gopher (Fig. 42, character 19) might represent earth, a reference to their cave and earth habitats (Dr. Alfred Gard- ner, personal communication, 1982). 32 From be- neath the turban falls a long strand of hair bound in red. Between the character's legs is a rectangular form, but an examination of both early photo- graphs and the original figure does not clarify whether this is a separate element or the end of the animal's loincloth apron. The jagged red element behind the rear leg, however, may be the apron. Although the legs are clearly human, the feet, slightly darker in color than the flesh-toned legs, are those of a bat. The character, then, may well be a human impersonator in bat costume. Character 9 The species of this animal has never been cer- tain. Seler did not attempt to identify it, and oth- ers have called it a jaguar (M. Coe 1987: 84; Morley and Brainerd 1983: figs. 13-22) (Fig. 32; 32 A polychrome vessel in the November collection (Robic- sek and Hales 1982: no. 19) depicts a bat with a caban (earth) sign suspended over its head, as if to suggest the underworld locale of the scene. PL 4). 33 However, the snout, sharp teeth, silky beard, long tail, and prehensile paws are all traits of the howler monkey (Fig. 3 4). 34 It is interesting to note that the unnatural blue color of the animal is shared with only one other character, the single human (Fig. 40, character 12). The color may have signified a relationship between man and monkeys, an affinity recognized by the Maya themselves (M. Coe 1977: 346; Hunn 1977: 203). Robertson (1983: 18) has established that at Palen- que, at least, blue connotes divine or precious things and the attributes of rulers. If the Maya of Acanceh shared the same color symbolism, this howler monkey may have had special status. Character 9's unusual headdress looks like a red- dened bone to which a blue disk with serpentine appendages has been attached. A small cross- hatched red crown outlined in blue covers short, cropped hair or feathers. At the neck is a white element: a cloth or rope necklace, or possibly an ear pendant. Around the rather plump (and possi- bly hunchbacked) body of the monkey is wrapped a knotted, red loincloth. Just below (and possibly attached to) the tail is an object that looks like a large feather. It is surmounted by the same rough- ened stucco material used in the bat's headdress. The elaborate speech scroll that emerges from the open mouth may refer to the howler mon- key's loud voice, which has been compared to that of the jaguar (Gaumer 1 91 7: 311). Neverthe- less, the presence of a speech scroll is not a clear indicator of the loudness of the animal's voice: the feline represented by character 15 lacks one, for example. Character 10 One of the best-preserved of the birds repre- sented in the upper register, character io's species is not clear (Fig. 32; PL 4). Like the other birds, it has raptorial claws clutching drops of blood, the knotted treble scroll at the tail, and decorative 40 33 Von Winning (1985: 20-22) believes that God N is repre- sented. He reads the creature's tongue as a cigar, his headdress as a net, his features for those of an aged man, and his knotted loincloth as a pectoral. 34 When shown this figure, Dr. Richard Thorington of the Smithsonian Institution, a specialist in monkeys, immediately confirmed my own hypothesis.</page><page sequence="47">wings. The head of the bird, which would presum- ably provide the best evidence for its identity, is also very stylized and heavily ornamented. The sharply downcurved beak suggests a bird of prey such as a hawk or eagle, but a macaw, a parrot, and a curassow are also possibilities.35 The orna- ments of the head and beak are unique, although the stacked bars immediately above the beak look like the knotted motifs shown on the bird's wings. Curved around the bird's head and terminating in a stepped motif is another waterband necklace, from which shells or drops are suspended over a knotted, red pendant. Knotted pendants, particularly red ones, may be attributes of bloodletting. Prisoners and those undergoing auto-sacrifice often wear neck or arm bands made of knotted cloth, which presumably became blood-soaked during extended bloodlet- ting rites (cf. Benson 1976; Scheie 1984). In any case, knots are included among the elements com- prising the Teotihuacan-derived costumes worn by figures participating in sacrificial acts on monu- mental sculpture (cf. Scheie 1984: fig- !8). The design on character io's wings differs slight- ly from that of the other birds. Instead of the curl and waterband motif below the cross-hatched cir- cle, intertwined blue bands appear to which red knots are attached, each terminating in a claw-like white pendant. Character 1 1 The rattlesnake, mouth open, tongue protrud- ing, and body arched is poised in mid-air as if about to strike (Fig. 32; PL 4; Fig. 35). The rigid position of the serpent's body and its unnaturally angular tongue recall central Mexican rather than Maya images (Fig. 36), and the bands of small red and yellow triangles on both the headdress and "collar" resemble Teotihuacan mosaic costume ele- ments (Fig. 22). 36 " Von Winning (1985: 31) sees this bird as a bat, citing Thompson but giving no specific source, and comparing it with images from the Borgia Group codices, which to my mind do not help sustain his argument. 41 36 See von Winning 1987, 1: chap. 1, figs. 1-3, for other examples of Teotihuacan serpents. He (1985: 23) points out that indicating the nose by a scroll is typical of serpents de- picted on Teotihuacan piano relief ware vessels. Fig. 35 Character 11: snake.

The snake's body was painted green, with yel- low used for the mouth, scales, and the stylized rattles which are outlined in blue. As von Win- ning (1985: 23) points out, the body is twisted so that the ventral scales appear on top. The body is decorated with the "half-star" motif that is often found along the borders of Teotihuacan murals. It can also be seen at Cacaxtla, on the square hiero- glyph to the left of the bird-man character on the south wall of Building A, and on the cloak of the principal character on the west side of Building B's battle scene (Fig. 19 and D. McVicker 1985: 5)- The derivation and meaning of the half-star have never been satisfactorily explained, although Baird's (1989) recent paper on the subject is an important step in understanding the motif. The "half-star" designation may derive from highland examples of stars, notably in Mixtec painting (cf. Fig. 38 Teotihuacan, Zone 5-A, Portico 19, Mural 1: detail of figure spearing heart. After A. Miller 1973: fig. 132.</page><page sequence="49">Spinden 191 3: fig. 239), but some have referred to it as a star-fish or a conch shell section (Kubler 1967: 6). A final possibility is that it represents half of the Maya completion sign, which in turn, Coggins argues (1980: 728, 736), may derive from Teotihuacan quadripartition. Whatever it repre- sents, it does seem to originate in Teotihuacan art and occur occasionally in Teotihuacan-influenced Maya art, particularly of the Early Classic (Baird 1989: 108-112). Although serpents abound in Maya art, there are none with the same markings of the Acanceh snake. The closest equivalent, on Codex Madrid 30, has semicircular disks with radiating knobs along its body (Fig. 37). Thompson (i960: 75), however, suggests that these are variants of the cross-hatched infix that forms part of the Chicchan hieroglyph and represents snake markings. The motifs of the Acanceh snake more closely resem- ble the half-star. Passing in front of and behind the snake's body is an odd curved element from whose tip dangles a glyph-like motif with the familiar red trident attached. This object, almost certainly an eccen- tric flint or knife, resembles the curved obsidian knives with paper-wrapped handles that are often carried by animal and human figures at Teotihua- can (Fig. 38 and Berrin 1988: pl. 37). The glyph-like element is a stylized human heart, a motif that seems to have originated at Teotihuacan and is particularly common in central Mexico. It occurs in hieroglyphic form at Xochi- calco, while at Cacaxtla it is prominent in the bat- tle scene of Building B, as an isolated hieroglyph, as a costume ornament for the victorious warriors, and even in the gaping chest of a fallen victim (Foncerrada de Molina 1982: figs. 17-28). Foncer- rada de Molina (1982), noting the association of this glyph with Tlaloc at Cacaxtla, points out that it underlines the bellicose aspect of that deity even at Teotihuacan, where there is less overt sacrificial imagery than in the art of some later cultures. Oth- ers (Langley 1982; Millon, catalogue entry in Ber- rin 1988: 217) have also recently commented on the prevalence of bloodletting iconography at Teo- tihuacan, where it has often been overlooked. In- deed, a recently published mural fragment, depict- Fig. 39 Copan, Stela 6: (a) loincloth; (b) sandal. After Proskouriakoff 1950: figs. 261, 30W. ing two coyotes tearing out a deer's heart, has been interpreted as a metaphorical representation of hu- man heart sacrifice (C. Millon 1988: fig. v.11).37 In the Maya area, the bleeding heart motif forms part of the complex of Teotihuacan-derived imagery associated with bloodletting. It can be seen, for example, on the turban headdresses of the principal figure on Stela 9 of Piedras Negras (Proskouriakoff 1950: fig. i8p), which features Teotihuacan costume elements and a captive. The ruler portrait on Stela 6 at Copan, dated 9. 12. 10. 0.0. (a.d. 682), around the same time as the proposed date of the Palace of the Stuccoes, is notable for several Teotihuacan features such as Tlaloc faces and year-signs in his headdress (Bau- dez 1986: fig. 4). On his loincloth the bleeding heart appears, with drops below it, and on his anklets is a dripping treble scroll (Fig. 39a, b). 37 David Brown (n.d.: 119) believes the two predators are pumas rather than coyotes. 43</page><page sequence="50">"O &lt;u o 'o 0 1 -T3 c X i/i j-i &lt;L&gt; .g 0 T3 s£ „ *J7) 11 &lt;u hJ .s ^ &lt;U Oj ^ &gt; Ui ;§£ £ s *S 3 C i&gt; T3 J 2 2 - &gt;* rt "o fi-S . . &lt;u HH J3 &lt;N 1 ^ (N 0 l/i £ l-l &lt;D l-l 4-&gt; (U U4 4-1 ^ * i-i 8 &lt;-&gt; i-i &lt;-&gt; 2 - U G-&gt; rt O &amp; 2 .spJ PU Oh</page><page sequence="51">Significantly, a bloodletting event is recorded on this stela (Scheie 1982: 273, 277). The bleeding heart, then, seems to be particu- larly important at highland sites that feature eclec- tic art styles, such as Cacaxtla and Xochicalco, and, in the Maya area, on monumental sculpture with Teotihuacan motifs and references to blood- letting. Character 12 From this character through character 17, a sec- tion of the hand-colored photograph of the frieze will be substituted for Breton's missing water- color (Fig. 40; PL 5). Although, as the sole human figure in the entire frieze, character 12 seems out of place, his presence is important for providing stylistic clues to the dating of the facade. In her major study of Maya monumental sculpture, Pro- skouriakoff (1950) created a chronological frame- work for stylistic change in the representation of the human figure that provides an independent check on monuments with Initial Series inscrip- tions and can suggest a time frame for undated sculpture. Unlike the coherent development of southern lowland sculpture, however, that of the north is more difficult to trace and seems to repre- sent heterogeneous schools affected by sporadic foreign incursions or influences (Proskouriakoff 195 1). Nevertheless, some of the points made by Proskouriakoff about the Classic Maya tradition in the south can be applied to northern relief sculp- ture as well.38 The figure's pose, for example, can probably be dated to no earlier than 9.8.0.0.0 (a.d. 593), or the beginning of the Late Classic Period. He stands in profile, legs apart but overlapping just above the knees, and with the near leg bent in a walking pose. The swaying kneeband, the outstretched arms, and the head tossed back, hair flying, re- inforce the sense of movement. There is some anatomical distortion, as indi- cated by the rather elongated left arm and the smaller right leg and foot, and the eye is shown 3® Justeson (n.d.), in an attempt to establish a date for the frieze, made a style graph of the type used by Proskouriakoff (1950) for traits in Maya relief sculpture. His graph indicates a date of about 9. 16. 10.0.0 (a.d. 761) for the relief. frontally rather than in profile. These traits, as well as the simplified anatomical contours and relatively unelaborate costume, are typical fea- tures of northern Maya sculpture (Proskouriakoff 1950: 156). The entire figure is painted a brilliant blue and has a shock of red hair (or possibly feathers) bound with a simple blue headband with reptilian markings. At Palenque, the color blue connotes divine or precious things, while mortals are al- ways shown with red bodies and hair (Robertson 1983: 17-18). Red hair (perhaps dyed or painted) is also represented in the murals of both Bonam- pak and Cacaxtla. Seler, taking a central Mexican perspective, be- lieved the character to represent Xochipilli, "god of the young maize, lord of dance and song" (191 1 : 1023). To support his attribution, he described the object in the character's mouth to be an ear of maize. Few alternatives to maize come to mind, except perhaps a thick cigar. Nevertheless, it is unlike other representations of cigars, which usu- ally emanate smoke and are held by the smoker. The blowgun used by the Hero Twin Hunahpu is also usually much longer (but cf. the short blow- gun illustrated in M. Coe 1989: fig. 14), and is normally held in the hunter's hands as well. The only other features the Acanceh character shares with this figure (often represented in Maya vase painting) are his youth and his headband. Although Breton's unpublished black and white drawing of this character indicates that his eye is human, an early photograph (Fig. 17) shows what may be the square pupil of a supernatural. Further- more, running from the corner of the eye to the headband is a jagged line, either a crack or a deity face-marking (the stucco above this line has fallen off the facade). Von Winning (1985: 32) sees this as a dotted line identifying the figure as God E or the young maize god of the codices, although the fig- ure bears no other attributes of this deity (cf. Taube 1985). A red cloth or rope ornament passes through the figure's ear, and a narrow piece of similar material appears to be tied around his neck. Both of these are attributes of persons engaged in sacri- fice (cf. Scheie 1984: fig. 12). Character 12, then, 45</page><page sequence="52">might be a victim or participant in bloodletting activities. He holds a small, simple "incense bag" in his right hand, while around his left wrist (or possi- bly behind it, attached to the belt) are two large balls. 39 From the tied belt hang shells, a motif typical of, although not limited to, Late Classic costume. The tendency for the belt to curve a - round the waist, thus giving the body volume, is also typically Late Classic (Proskouriakoff 1950: 65). The costume is completed by a rather long, decorated loincloth apron at front and back, a single garter, simple tied sandals, and a large back ornament. The latter, decorated with a stepped fret motif and topped with short, red feathers, recalls the more elaborate backracks of figures de- picted in both monumental sculpture and poly- chrome ceramics in the southern Maya lowlands. Even allowing for the aberrant and non-Classic features of Yucatec sculpture, this figure can al- most certainly be dated to the Late, rather than the Early, Classic Period. The figure's propor- tions, pose, and costume also indicate a date well before the possibility of Toltec influence, and com- pared to some of the other characters represented on the frieze, even Teotihuacan elements do not occur. In the absence of extant stucco reliefs de- picting humans in the northern lowlands, the clos- est comparison (geographically and stylistically) might be with the interior and exterior stucco reliefs at the Late Classic Maya site of Comal- calco, in the Gulf Coast area of Tabasco (Fig. 41 and G. Andrews 1975: figs. 117-118). The resem- blance of the site's famous tomb sculptures to certain western Yucatec sculpture has already been noted (Proskouriakoff 1950: 149), and the discovery of other figures in recent years rein- forces the comparison. Like the Acanceh figure, they are characterized by simplified anatomy with some distortion, fleshy faces, rather awkward pos- tures, and relatively unadorned costumes.40 39 Not a bird, as von Winning (1985: 32) suggests. 40 Observations by the author, 1975 and 1982. As far as I know, the only published illustrations of these reliefs are in Blom and LaFarge 1926-27, G. Andrews et al. 1967, and G. Andrews 1975, and do not include the entire corpus. Character 13 This is a yellow rodent whose bushy tail, wrapped in a jeweled band, curls up behind it (Fig. 40; PI. 5). Although it bears some resem- blance to character 3, there are enough differences to make its identification as another squirrel uncer- tain (cf. von Winning 1985: 24). Its headdress, like those represented on several other characters, is depicted frontally rather than in a foreshortened profile view, a device commonly used in Meso- american art when clarity is required over visual accuracy. The segmented design of the headdress and jewelry again recalls Teotihuacan costume (cf. Figs. 22, 38). Character 14 Although partially destroyed, character 14 is still the best preserved of the birds represented, and is therefore the one with the most clearly recognizable features (Fig. 40; PI. 5). Despite the short legs and neck, large raptorial claws, and stylized wings, the long, curving beak identifies the bird as the mythological Maya waterbird (cf. Fig. 30). This hybrid has variously been described as a crane, heron, pelican, cormorant, or some combination of these birds (Coggins 1975: 298- 299). The bird shown here, while most closely resembling a cormorant, is clearly not intended to represent a single species accurately.41 The bird's breast feathers, once bright green, were created using the local technique of placing limestone flakes in wet stucco. The relative natu- ralism of the ruffled breast feathers contrasts sharply with the flat, decorative wings painted in red and blue.42 In an unusual departure from the restrictions of the frame, the bird's tail passes un- der the frame of the next cartouche to reemerge just in front of character 15's face. Although not all characters are wholly contained within their 41 Although von Winning (1985: 33) presents evidence to suggest that a king vulture is represented, the beak seems too long for a vulture. 42 A polychrome plate of unknown provenience features a waterbird whose wing pattern is very similar to those de- picted on the Acanceh birds (Bolz 1975: pl. lxii). The rest of the bird, which holds a large fish in its beak, is represented naturalistically. 46</page><page sequence="53">Fig. 41 Comalcalco, stucco figures from tomb: (top) fig- ures restored; (bottom) wall as originally found. After Morley and Brainerd 1983: fig. 13.21. frames (cf. characters 3, 10), this is the only one continuing beyond it. The bird wears the waterband necklace from which three red elements are suspended, as well as the familiar segmented headdress. Its head is painted yellow, the lidded eye red, and the eye ring blue. Two bead-like pellets mark the points where the long beak joins the face and where it opens, and a third pellet is held at the tip of the beak.43 A speech scroll, blue with red tabs, emer- 43 In his General History of the Things of New Spain, Book 11, Sahagun (1963: 30) states that the pelican was hunted for a precious green stone or feather found in its gizzard that was a ges from the open beak and curls up behind it, gracefully filling the space above the bird's head. Waterbirds occur in monumental sculpture, polychrome ceramics, and other media through- out the Maya lowlands.44 Despite its frequent ap- pearance, the waterbird's significance for the Clas- sic Maya is not well understood. At Tikal, for example, where waterbirds are represented in sign that the hunter would henceforth prosper. Perhaps the Maya shared this belief, in which case the object held in the beak here might be the coveted stone. Cf. the lintel of Str. 5D-52 at Tikal (Jones and Satterth- waite 1982: fig. 75) and a carved Chochola vessel (M. Coe 1973: no. 63). 47</page><page sequence="54">both sculpture and ceramics, it has been sug- gested that they may have served as symbols of dynastic origins or ties with riverine areas to the north and east of the site, or even as domestic pets (Coggins 1975: 300, 302). Their rarity in monumental art elsewhere, however, would seem to indicate a broader meaning. Michael Coe (1973: 123), for example, sees waterbirds repre- sented on funerary ceramics as denizens of the watery Maya underworld. A painted vase depict- ing a row of cormorants standing above a series of trilobed motifs like those appearing on some of the Acanceh birds' tails underscores their associa- tion with water, at least (Fig. 30). Character 13 The snarling mouth and large teeth, sharp claws, feline ear, and long tail clearly identify this animal as a feline, probably a jaguar or puma (Seler 191 1: 1021) (Fig. 40; PL 5). Since in the colored photo- graph it is yellow without spots or other mark- ings, it is most likely the latter animal. In contrast to the more restricted range of the jaguar, the slightly smaller puma once ranged throughout Mexico, existing almost entirely on a diet of deer, once abundant in Yucatan (Leopold 1959: 476). While of the felines present in the Maya area, the jaguar is the largest and most feared by man, both cats have reputations as man-eaters (Gaumer 191 7: 172, 183). « The puma is said to have such a strong preference for blood that it often kills a number of animals for the blood alone, leaving the meat un- touched (Gaumer 191 7: 184). Appropriately, then, the predatory nature of the cat is indicated here by the blood symbols at the neck and before the gap- ing jaws, and by the severed human head, neck painted red, that lies at its feet. The tied headband recalls the cloth wristlets, ear ornaments, and neckpieces often seen on sacri- ficial victims depicted in Maya art. But recently severed heads, although appearing with some fre- quency in vase painting, are rarely depicted in monumental art and never outside the context of 45 According to Leopold, however, this reputation is largely undeserved, as tales of man-eating jaguars in Mexico are unau- thenticated and reports of attacks on humans by either cat are extremely rare (1959: 469, 480). human sacrifice or warfare. This juxtaposition of an aggressive, man-eating feline and its prey is therefore quite unusual, and emphasizes the other- wise understated references to bloodletting and death elsewhere in the frieze. Character 16 The bird is in a descending position, body neatly and symmetrically contained within its car- touche (Fig. 40; PL 5). Although its head is de- stroyed, the remains of a crest of short feathers and a hooked beak can still be seen. An elaborate, bifurcated speech scroll emerges from the beak. The wing and tail feathers are decoratively styl- ized, as they are on the other birds, and do not provide any clues to the bird's species. Neverthe- less, the crest, hooked beak, and large claws sug- gest an eagle or hawk. Character 1 7 The second frog or toad represented in the frieze occurs here (Fig. 40; PL 5). Although it shares some features with character 1, such as webbed feet, this creature lacks the reptilian body markings, teeth, and speech scroll.46 But the lid- ded eye and the dotted nose ornament are also present in many examples of the uinal glyph. The animal's costume is completed by a knotted, red loincloth, red and white tied pendant, and the usual small, segmented headdress. Character 18 Breton's color drawings resume with this char- acter (Fig. 42; PL 6). This bird differs from the others in having long, sweeping, green tail feath- ers. Although the upper half of the wing is styl- ized in the usual manner, the wing terminates in fine, long feathers that move freely in space, un- like the shorter, broader, and stiffer feathers of, *6 Von Winning (1985: 27) argues that this figure represents the Jaguar God of the Underworld. He interprets the orna- ment on the animal's back loincloth as the numeral 7, a num- ber associated with this deity. He also compares the curl at the corner of the mouth to that of the Maya sun god and sees the webbed feet as claws and the pointed ears as jaguar ears. Nev- ertheless, I feel it more closely resembles Maya images of frogs. 48</page><page sequence="55">for example, character 16 (Fig. 40). Again, the absence of the head and the ever-present raptorial claws create problems in identifying the bird, but the long, green feathers are attributes of a macaw or quetzal. Character lg This animal is of particular interest because it is a full-figure version of the well-known "jog" glyph (X757), now recognized to be a pocket gopher ( ba in Maya) (Proskouriakoff 1968) (Fig. 42; PL 6; Fig. 43). 47 It is also one of the few animals in the frieze for which there is a close hieroglyphic counterpart, although the bat, frog, monkey, jaguar, and birds all take a variety of hieroglyphic forms. The gopher's salient physical characteristics - stout, corpulent body, yellowish coloring, small eye, round cheek, abbreviated lower jaw, and es- pecially its paired, curved incisors - are all accu- rately rendered. The gopher's navel is promi- nently indicated above its blue loincloth, drawing attention to its round belly. Around its neck and just overlapping the rectangular pendant is a wo- ven neckband, while from the back of the blue headdress a cross-hatched red "tail" hangs. The headdress itself, of stucco and limestone flakes, is similar to the puffy turban of the bat. Like several of the other animals, the gopher has a ringed eye, a feature not associated with the hieroglyphic ver- sion of the animal. It may allude to the gopher's ability to see in its dark, underground habitat, but it could also impart a sacrificial role to the animal. The kan cross (T281) on the gopher's cheek may refer to the yellow color of the animal's skin (Dutting 1974: 58). It is a consistent feature of the Late Classic variant of the glyph: in the Early Classic, another version of the rodent's head lack- ing the kan cross, T788, is used (Proskouriakoff 1968). The earliest example of T757 with T281 infixed occurs on Piedras Negras Lintel 12, dated 9.4.0.0.0, but almost all others are from Late Clas- sic monuments. The presence of this full-figure variant of T757 adds further support to the stylis- tic and iconographic evidence that the frieze is Late Classic in date. * Von Winning (1985: 28) sees character 19 as an opossum and, by extension, a Bacab. While the functions of the T757 glyph are dis- puted, it can be noted that with a T 1 ( u ) prefix, it may act as a general verb associated with many different actions, and is often attached to phrases specifying the particular event (Proskouriakoff 1968: 249; Josserand, Scheie, and Hopkins 1985: 87, 97). Among these are period-ending celebra- tions, visions induced by auto-sacrifice, and blood- letting. Fox and Justeson (1984: 28, note 7) in fact argue that in some contexts, T757 may function as a verb specifically meaning "to let blood," since bah (pan-Mayan for "to strike, pierce") means ex- actly that in Tzeltalan.48 Although this T757 does not form part of an inscription and therefore has no obvious grammatical function, it is neverthe- less of interest to note its presence among other figures with more overt connections to sacrifice and blood. Among the Lacandons today, dreaming about a gopher is a bad omen, foretelling someone's death and burial (Aguilera 1985: 30). This idea may relate to the gopher's habit of burrowing under- ground. Character 20 This animal is easily identified as a spider mon- key by its spindly arms, slender fingers, small head, and flattened profile (Fig. 42; PL 6). No doubt the descending position refers to the spider monkey's ability to move through the trees with agility, suspended from the branches by its long tail. Since both spider and howler monkeys spend much of their lives in the trees, however, it is puz- zling that the former should be represented in the upper tier with flying creatures while the latter is consigned to the terrestrial group below. In his analysis of the role of monkeys as Maya scribes, Coe (1977: 346) suggests that while the howler predominates in Maya iconography and myth, it may have been to some extent interchangeable with the spider monkey. At Acanceh, however, 48 Josserand, Scheie, and Hopkins (1979) and Justeson and Norman (n.d.) come to different conclusions regarding the T757 compound's exact grammatical function in Maya texts. The authors agree, however, that it is essentially verbal and occurs in references to bloodletting rites. Victoria Bricker (1986: 135-138) discusses the context and meaning of T757. 49</page><page sequence="56">d o 5 "o3 &lt; &gt;S -Q t-i O 8 S 6 n 0 M n 0 «i x nj H-i C &lt;S VJ JC •a 2 !s O C/D T3 r£ '§•« 55 | 7 l&gt; 5T 1/5 O 3 12 2 ^ V5 .. *c S£ =e o M &gt;N to .*3 $ u U &lt;U nJ J3 2 ^ U £ M .

In a variation on the anthropomorphization of the Acanceh fauna, the spider monkey has been given a headdress in the form of a human face, a reversal of the custom of providing Maya rulers with animal or bird face headdresses. While the headdress may be simply a reference to the affin- ity between humans and monkeys, what may be real shrunken heads, presumably the result of war or sacrifice, ornament the costumes of Maya rul- ers in monumental art (cf. M. Miller 1986: 161). However, the presence of both the spider and howler monkey recalls Hun Batz (One Howler Monkey) and Hun Chouen (One Spider Monkey), half-brothers of the Hero Twins of the Popol Vuh who were transformed into monkeys and became the patrons of writers, artisans, and musicians (Tedlock 1985: 121-124, 353; M. Coe 1977)- A vase from Copan depicts a scribe making a human mask or perhaps a human being (Scheie and Miller 1986; 139, pl. 44a). Perhaps this spider monkey wears such a mask to indicate his creator role. The monkeys also have celestial connotations: the kin (sun or day) glyph in its full-figure form is repre- sented as a monkey. And while the moon is usually considered female throughout Mesoamerica, among the Lacandon the moon is identified with the nocturnal howler monkey, while the spider monkey, a day animal, symbolizes the sun (Bruce 1976-77: 195) Von Winning (1985: 35) suggests that because this character is in descending posi- tion and is placed at the western end of the frieze, it may represent the setting sun. Character 21 The last of the twenty-one animals is another rattlesnake which appears to twist within its car- touche, revealing the yellow scales on its belly as it turns (Fig. 42; PL 6). Its body is blue, without the markings of Character 1 1 , and around its neck is a waterband necklace with small pendants like that of character 10 (Fig. 32). Unfortunately, no trace of the animal's head remains in either old photographs or Breton's watercolor. 5i</page><page sequence="58">CHAPTER 3 Interpretations of the Frieze Although Seler (191 1) provided a detailed descrip- tion of the frieze, identifying the figures and analyz- ing the moldings, he did not attempt to interpret its meaning. He hoped that clearing the sides of the building would reveal more stucco reliefs that would allow for an interpretation of the well- preserved facade (Seler 191 1: 1024). Unfortu- nately, when the rest of the building was finally uncovered, it had mostly collapsed, and no decora- tion remained on the exposed surfaces (Fig. 11). Since its discovery, moreover, no comparable ar- chitectural sculpture has appeared in the Maya area. The facade at the Palace of the Stuccoes, then, remains unique in style and theme. While not usually the subject of monumental sculpture, animals are well represented in other arts and were, of course, significant in many facets of ancient Maya life. *9 The ritual use of fauna is well documented for the Post-Classic (Tozzer 1 941: 11 4- 115) and continues to the present. The remains of many different species have been found in caches, burials, caves, and cenotes (Pohl 1983). Animals and birds are also featured in both an- cient and contemporary Maya mythology, includ- ing the Popol Vuh. Although the Maya epic has been used increasingly to interpret scenes on Ma- ya funerary ceramics (M. Coe 1973), it does not seem to be readily applicable to the characters depicted here: among them, only the monkeys and the bat have prominent roles in the story. There are undoubtedly many other lost tales in which human behavior and the social order are mirrored in the animal world, however. For a useful illustrated introduction to Pre-Columbian fauna of Mesoamerica, see Aguilera 1985. Since animal and bird surnames were common among the Maya at the time of the Conquest (Roys 1940) and still function among the Lacandon (Tozzer 1907: 40-42), the figures could conceivably represent patronymics or heraldic crests. No prece- dents exist in the Classic Period, at least, for repre- senting names by full-size animals, despite the an- cient Maya practice of incorporating animals in the hieroglyphs for rulers' personal or family names, both in the inscriptions and in elite costumes. The Mexica did sometimes represent their rulers as hi- eroglyphic effigies, as exemplified by the eroded stone at Tetzcotzingo depicting King Netzahual- coyotl (Fasting Coyote) of Texcoco (Townsend 1982: 53-59). Although the southern Maya in par- ticular usually combined naturalistic portraiture with hieroglyphic texts, a different tradition may have existed among the northern Maya, where the inscriptions are fewer and briefer. Similar to the Lacandon animal clan names are the spirit companions of the Tzotzil (Holland 1964: 16-17; Vogt 1969: 371-374). Nagualism (the ability to transform oneself into an animal) and tonalism (having an animal companion) are widespread concepts throughout Mesoamerica, although they tended to merge together after the Spanish conquest (Foster 1944; Musgrave-Portilla 1982). The Quiche Maya apply the term naual more broadly, to refer to the spiritual essence of a person, animal, place, etc. (Tedlock 1985: 337). Some of the animals and birds mentioned in the above sources occur on the frieze, including mon- key (both spider and howler), eagle (or any bird of prey), puma or jaguar, and squirrel. While the presence of naguals and tonals has 52</page><page sequence="59">not yet been conclusively demonstrated for the Classic Maya, it is possible that some of the ani- mals depicted, especially in vase painting, may represent these creatures. Indeed, a recent hiero- glyphic decipherment (Houston and Stuart 1989) suggests that the Classic Maya elite, at least, iden- tified their "companion spirits" or "co-essences" and illustrated them in their art. One theory regarding the frieze, proposed many years ago, is that the animals and birds represent the signs of a Maya zodiac (Hagar 1914). Hagar's claim is invalidated by the fact that he based his observations on Western rather than on indigenous zodiacs, but the thesis has never been completely abandoned (Aveni 1980: 199-200). There is, in fact, evidence that the Maya represented stars and constellations with animal images, as demon- strated in Room 2 at Bonampak (M. Miller 1986: pls. 16, 19), on a lintel of the Nunnery of Chichen Itza (Maudslay 1889-1902, 3: pl. 13), and in the Paris Codex (1968: 23-24). It is also known that the Pleiades were seen as "the rattlesnake's tail" (ah tsab kanul) (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 849; Aveni 1980: 34). The other creatures represented here, how- ever, do not correspond to any of the remaining known animal zodiac figures, which include the turtle and peccaries. While the relationship between the diverse ani- mals depicted on the frieze may not be obvious to a non-Maya observer, an understanding of Maya zoological taxonomy suggests that they may be more closely related than is at first apparent. Physi- cal similarities, perceived patterns of behavior, and ritual or medicinal functions can all determine ani- mal classification. Indeed, otherwise dissimilar creatures might be brought together visually in any number of ways foreign to Western modes of representation, just as they might also be con- nected to the human realm. Furthermore, animal imagery and symbols in Mesoamerica can carry metaphorical as well as linguistic values and there- fore cannot be read as simply a faithful record of the natural world (cf. Brown n.d.: 84-85). The fairly obvious celestial-terrestrial division between the characters in the upper and lower registers of the frieze has already been noted. With the exception of the single human (who 53 may in fact be winged) and the spider monkey, all of the characters in the upper tier can fly. Never- theless, since the monkey spends most of its time in treetops (Leopold 1959: 334), the Maya may have linked it to the celestial sphere. Its connec- tion with the sky is reinforced by the existence of the monkey substitution for the kin hieroglyph. The bat, of course, shares the bird's ability to fly, and the Tzeltal Maya in fact recognize an affinity between them (Hunn 1977: 201). In Yucatec, one of the species of bat is known as ikim soots' , de- rived from ikim, a word for nocturnal bird or owl (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 26). The remaining birds in the upper register are quite stylized, but at the same time are depicted as belonging to different species. Nevertheless, all have been transformed into raptorial birds by their large claws. The dripping blood motif that appears in the claws of several of the birds re- inforces the image of predatory beasts and also recalls the name of one of the lords of Xibalba, "Bloody Claws" (Tedlock 1985: 328). The recognizable animals of the lower sphere are terrestrial or amphibian, although one might dispute the presence of two decidedly arboreal mammals, the squirrel and the howler monkey. In Tzeltal, however, both animals are part of a monkey complex that also includes rabbits and gophers (Hunn 1977: 203-207). A number of the animals and birds represented, such as the feline, bat, and frog, have nocturnal habits. The ability to see well, either in the dark or at a great distance, may be indicated by the goggles worn by some of the creatures. Even crea- tures as dissimilar as snakes and felines might have been related taxonomically by the Maya be- cause of their hypnotic gaze and pupils that con- tract to vertical slits in strong light (Brown n.d.: 141). Snakes, bats, frogs, and some birds live in and around caves, while gophers and squirrels burrow underground. Several of the animals are also amphibious. Reference has already been made to the role of waterbirds and anurans for the Maya. Although rarely represented on a monumental scale, aquatic animals such as waterbirds, turtles, and toads were modeled in stucco on the rims of chultunes,</page><page sequence="60">used for the storage of rainwater in the dry Puuc area of Yucatan (Barrera Rubio 1985). It has already been suggested that the stepped niche surrounding each character is a stylized cave opening. Relevant to the Acanceh frieze, perhaps, is the fact that the Maya words k'u (temple) and aktun (cave) both have secondary meanings of ani- mal burrow or nest (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 7, 416). 50 At one and the same time, then, the figures may be understood as inhabiting their burrow, a cave, and a temple. And although there is no evi- dence that the Palace of the Stuccoes itself was built over a cave, this practice is well documented in Mesoamerica (Hey den 1981). Maya pyramids built over caves include the so-called High Priest's Grave at Chichen Itza, for example. Caves and cenotes may have been linked concep- tually by the Maya, not only as water sources but as entrances to the underworld. The relationship between them is reinforced by the similarity of offerings, including animal remains, that were de- posited in both (Pohl 1983: 98). The Cenote Chun Kapoc, located a few blocks north of Acanceh's main plaza, has not been explored archaeologically but undoubtedly served the Pre-Columbian com- munity. It contains a long (30 m by 7 m), flooded cave inhabited by a large bat population (Reddell 1977: 256). As a place of transition to the under- world, it would be surprising if Acanceh's cenote, like those of Dzibilchaltun and other northern sites, was not the focus of ritual activity and offerings. A continuing thread throughout the frieze is the water imagery represented by the accoutrements of the fauna, the vessels below the superior mold- ing, and the waterband that forms the upper frame for the niches below. The presence of drops and the position of the band at the top of the frieze imply that rainfall, rather than a standing body of water like a cenote or the mythical watery under- world, is represented. Among the Maya and in- deed throughout Mesoamerica, caves were seen as the abodes of rain deities and sources of rain- 5° I am indebted to Andrea Stone (n.d.) for this observation. Her book on Maya cave painting will provide a much-needed source on this important aspect of Maya art. See also the useful catalogue of Maya caves compiled by Juan Luis Bonor Villarejo (1989). 54 clouds, wind, and lightning (MacLeod and Pule- ston 1978: 72-73). Chalcatzingo Monument 1, with rainclouds and raindrops depicted above a misty cave, is an early manifestation of this con- cept. While the Acanceh waterband is unlike Clas- sic Maya waterbands (cf. Coggins 1983: 44-52), it may well be a local Teotihuacan-inspired version. Closely associated with the water iconography of the frieze is that of blood. It is represented not only by such obvious motifs as a severed head and dripping blood, but also by the complex of Teotihuacan motifs, including ringed eyes, speech scrolls, stylized hearts, and central Mexican cos- tume elements that were adopted by the Late Clas- sic Maya as insignia of bloodletting. Tedlock (j985: 337) notes that in the Popol Vuh the word naual is sometimes paired with puz, a term refer- ring both to cutting the flesh with a knife and to heart sacrifice. If the Acanceh animals are "com- panion spirits," the accoutrements of bloodletting that accompany them underline their sacrificial role. The combination of sacrificial and water motifs suggests that the entire relief might be viewed as an unusual version of the underworld, or perhaps more correctly as the place of transition between the world of the living and that of the under- world gods. In the Popol Vuh , for example, the lords of the underworld used birds and animals as messengers (Tedlock 1985: 109, 128 ff). The fau- na represented here may have been understood as inhabitants of the earth, guardians to its openings, and mediators between the realm of man and that of the underworld. The skyband below might at first seem out of place in a relief apparently dedicated to the wa- tery underworld. As noted above, however, sky- bands in basal positions occur elsewhere in Maya art. Furthermore, the remaining head of the ser- pent is upside down, suggesting that at the east- ern end, at least, it is dead (Seler 191 1: 1015- 10 16). Scheie and Miller (1986: 45) compare the double-headed skyband to the westerly journey of Venus pulling the sun out of the underworld in the morning and following it back in at night. Generally speaking, when the celestial monster is used in architecture, the "front" or living head is</page><page sequence="61">placed at the western side of the structure, repre- senting Venus, while the inverted and sometimes partially skeletal head, symbolizing the sun in the underworld, appears in the east, following Venus out of the underworld at dawn. With the western head of the Acanceh celestial serpent missing, it can no longer be determined if the same pattern holds, but it would be logical with- in its context. Robertson (n.d.) has shown that the various bicephalic monsters of the Palace at Palenque - most marked with sky signs - are re- lated to death and sacrifice, frame entrances to the underworld, and decorate stone benches on which rulers' corpses may have been placed. The missing heads of the large birds at the east and west ends of the frieze preclude the identifica- tion of species. Nevertheless, since they substitute for the more common Chac mask motif, it is tempting to see them as examples of the muan bird associated with the topmost layer of the Maya universe, with clouds and rain, but also with night and the underworld (Thompson i960: 114-115; 1972: 55). Since they frame the entire frieze, they may have served to unite the sky, earth, and underworld. Exterior architectural decoration in the Late Classic rarely encompasses overt underworld themes, emphasizing instead aspects of rulership such as royal portraiture and insignia, dynastic nar- rative, and the relationship between the ruler and deities. Purely mythical imagery, including anthro- pomorphized animals, is usually relegated to the private sphere and the world of the dead, as examplified by funerary ceramics. Nevertheless, there is at least one precedent for underworld imag- ery in the northern lowlands, in the frieze of the contemporaneous Str. i-sub at Dzibilchaltun (Fig. 15). Although its iconography is distinct from that of Acanceh, which emphasizes the terrestrial and sacrificial aspects of the underworld, it may refer to the waters of the underworld, and specifically to the Cenote Xlacah at the site's center (Coggins 1983: 36). Waterlilies, shells, trilobal water motifs, and other symbols of water, as well as long-nosed skeletal heads, ornament the streams of the under- world that cover the upper facade of the building. Str. 1 -sub must also be seen in context, as one part of the large ritual architectural complex of Dzibilchaltun. While the growth of the modern town over the ancient ruins obscures the plan of Pre-Conquest Acanceh, it is clear that the Acropo- lis was built south and slightly east of the earlier pyramid and the other mounds near it, as if to form the southern end of a north-south axis or plaza. When constructed, the Palace of the Stuc- coes would have faced the great pyramid and probably would have been the highest structure at the site. How long the Palace enjoyed this promi- nent position cannot be determined, but when a second structure was built very close to and oppo- site the Palace, it would have visually sealed it off from the older pyramid, perhaps changing its function and reducing its importance. Eventually, both structures were filled in and used as the foun- dation for another building in the new Florescent style of architecture, obliterated and preserved at the same time, as were so many Maya buildings. While a definitive interpretation of this unique facade remains elusive, this analysis makes possi- ble a clearer view of its significance in Late Clas- sic Maya history. If the Palace of the Stuccoes was built at the close of the seventh century, as has been proposed, its construction would have fallen at the beginning of the Epiclassic Period, an era characterized by the exchange of goods, people, and ideas throughout Mesoamerica. Although the direct influence of Teotihuacan had waned consid- erably after about a.d. 550, revivals of Teotihua- can imagery occur in the Maya area toward the end of the seventh century, predating the more pronounced cultural changes of the Post-Classic, beginning with the Itza or Putun and culminating with the great cosmopolitan center of Chichen Itza, inextricably (but still inexplicably) linked with Tula. The presence of at least two Teotihuacan-influ- enced buildings (the Palace of the Stuccoes and Dzibilchaltun Structure 612) in the north during Early Period II raises questions regarding the na- ture of contact with the highlands at this time. In the first place, the structures were built close to or even after the demise of Teotihuacan as a major power in Mesoamerica. Second, unlike the Guate- malan highlands and the Peten, their construction 55</page><page sequence="62">is preceded in Early Period I by only a handful of artifacts displaying non-Maya features (Andrews V 1979: 245). While shifting trade relationships between Maya and non-Maya are probably signifi- cant, they can only partially explain the new preoc- cupation with foreign architectural forms. The Acanceh frieze should be seen not as an example of Teotihuacan influence in the northern lowlands, but as a deliberate adaptation of central Mexican forms to Maya ends. A similar borrow- ing and redefining of Teotihuacan elements can be seen on monuments contemporary with Acanceh in the southern Maya lowlands that depict or com- memorate battles, sacrifice, and self-mutilation. Although the protagonists of the Acanceh relief are animals rather than humans, they, too, wear insignia of Teotihuacan. I have proposed that the entire facade refers to sacrifice, death, and the Maya underworld, themes that are reiterated in many different forms in all media of Classic Maya art. While the emphasis on Teotihuacan-derived composition and motifs is striking, it does not necessarily signify direct central Mexican influ- ence. At Teotihuacan itself nothing exists that even distantly resembles the frieze. The eclectic nature of the facade can be com- pared to the architectural reliefs of Xochicalco and the murals of Cacaxtla, works dating from ap- proximately the same time as Acanceh, or slightly later. Different as the media and themes are at the three sites, the artists working there were able to recombine stylistic and iconographic elements from various sources in new and unfamiliar ways. While Cacaxtla for the most part adopted the Maya style, Xochicalco's sources may have in- cluded not only the Maya region, but also Oaxa- ca, Teotihuacan, Veracruz, and the Pacific coast (Nagao 1989: 98; V. Smith n.d.: 406-407). The political interactions that led to these new artistic expressions are still not well understood, but the idea that eclectic monuments literally reflect inva- sion or migration must be abandoned and re- placed by fresh and more complex models (cf. Nagao 1989: 83). In any case, excessively militaris- tic or sacrifical imagery may represent politically manipulative, self-aggrandizing statements rather than historical reality (cf. Nagao 1989; Stone 1989). In the case of Acanceh, its setting within a mod- ern town and the lack of excavation at the site have made it particularly difficult to understand its cultural connections, both within and outside the Maya area. Despite its modest size, Acanceh, like Xochicalco and Cacaxtla, was able to create a work whose sources come from far outside its presumably small sphere of influence. But be- cause the stucco frieze excludes for the most part the human protagonists who might be seen as real or at least symbolic participants in human events, its message remains esoteric. In a recent analysis of the Cacaxtla murals, George Kubler (1980) pointed out the necessity of defining more clearly terms like "eclecticism" and "syncretism" which are frequently used to de- scribe artistic phenomena that defy neat cultural classification. Kubler bases his definitions on Enrico Crispolti's analysis of eclecticism in art (1961). While Crispolti is concerned mostly with the Near East and Europe, much of his discussion can be applied to Pre-Columbian art. For exam- ple, he addresses commercial, political, and ideo- logical explanations for the development of eclec- tic styles, all of which have been proposed as reasons for changes in Mesoamerican art styles. A distinction is made between diachronic eclecti- cism, in which artists or patrons make aesthetic choices from the distant past, including those from the same civilization's past, in order to cre- ate a new style, and synchronic eclecticism, in which the borrowing is from the recent past and is dictated by political and economic consider- ations (Crispolti 1961: col. 546; Kubler 1980: 172). Kubler suggests that the patrons and artists of Cacaxtla, and by implication those responsible for other eclectic Mesoamerican art styles, were more concerned with synchronic than diachronic choices. While in Pre-Columbian art is is proba- bly impossible to isolate aesthetic, political, or ideological reasons for the development of any eclectic style, a distinction can obviously be made between styles that seem to be inextricably linked with military conquest, such as that of Chichen Itza, those that may represent dynastic links with foreigners, as proposed for Early Classic Tikal, and those that are removed in time and/or space 56</page><page sequence="63">from the contributing culture. This last form of eclecticism, which seems to fit comfortably in neither of Kubler's two categories of eclecticism, is best represented by the widespread Mexi- canizing cultural renascence of 9.13.0.0.0 in the Maya area. By this time, central Mexican ele- ments are often so transformed or assimilated that it is impossible to determine their original source or means of transmission, although they must have passed through cultural filters like the Gulf Coat area to reach their final destination. Unlike both earlier and later manifestations of central highland influence in the Maya area, the northern Mexicanizing phenomenon of Early Pe- riod II appears to have been a local and presum- ably voluntary reinterpretation of Teotihuacan forms rather than one directly transplanted from outside or imposed by foreigners. Just as the oc- cupants of Xochicalco and Cacaxtla may have turned to contemporary Maya models when they wished to enhance their prestige, the Maya them- selves continued to look to the central highlands for images of power. We might well ask if the elites, at least, of each region were able to read and interpret the art of other cultures at this time. At the same time, the Acanceh facade is unlike other contemporary examples of eclecticism in which minor central Mexican motifs are grafted onto essentially Maya forms, as in the Teotihua- can costume elements occurring on many Late Classic stelae. The example of Acanceh represents a special kind of syncretism in which Maya and central Mexican sculptural techniques, style, and iconography are smoothly woven together to cre- ate a new form that is neither entirely revivalistic nor entirely synchronic, since no similar expres- sion exists in extant Teotihuacan or Maya art. Fu- ture archaeological discoveries in the northern lowlands, the adjacent Gulf Coast region, and the central highlands will, it is hoped, expand the corpus of cosmopolitan monuments and clarify the nature of cultural contacts within Mesoamer- ica during the Epiclassic. In the meantime, the frieze of the Palace of the Stuccoes at Acanceh remains a unique example of Epiclassic eclecti- cism in the northern Maya lowlands. 57</page><page sequence="64">Appendix The Murals The reprinted version of Seler's paper on Acanceh includes an appendix on some hieroglyphs painted on the walls of "tomb chambers" (1902- 23: 403-404). The exact location of these cham- bers is not clear from Seler's description, al- though they would appear to have been in the structure to the north of the Palace.51 Since Seler describes them as rooms "closed from all sides and accessible only from above," it is probable that he saw the vaulted rooms of one of the build- ings, which at the time would have had no direct access but could only have been entered by break- ing through the roof or upper facade. The Palace of the Stuccoes, originally cleared only as far as the medial molding, was for a time believed to have been the terrace of a pyramid (Breton 1908: 37; Seler 191 1: 1015). Although Breton states, and Seler suggests, that "tomb chambers" also lay be- hind the stucco facade, neither offers evidence, such as skeletal remains or offerings, for designat- ing these rooms as tombs.52 51 Seler describes the location of these chambers as follows: Here in levelling an artificial mound, burial chambers faced with stucco were encountered, and opposite these a wall facing N., about 12 m. long and 2 m. high, behind which burial chambers were also probably hidden, but the wall lies somewhat higher and is divided by a narrow passage from the S. front of the burial chambers mentioned first (Seler 191 1: 1014; Eng. trans. 1939: 2). In the appendix published with the reprinted version of the article, Seler (1902-23: 403; my translation) writes: The tombs that have been discovered in front of the stucco facade described above form rooms that are closed from all sides and seem to have been accessbile only from above. Note that the "burial chambers" are also described as faced with stucco. If this facade is the south exterior wall of the struc- ture to the north of the palace, nothing remains today of any stucco coating: the remaining wall, destroyed above the level of the medial molding, is of roughly cut stone like the Palace. 52 In a footnote, Breton (1908: 37) reters to a mass 01 breccia, which apparently contained human dust, in front of Although Structure 2's interior was coated with a thick layer of stucco (Andrews IV 1965: fig. 8), no investigator mentions any murals at Acanceh. It is therefore surprising to find among the Bre- ton material in Bristol three watercolors labeled only "copy of wall painting, small chamber, Acan- ceh" (Figs. 44-46; Pis. 7-9). These paintings de- pict standing figures and fragmentary texts, one of which is illustrated in Seler's appendix. With the possible exception of one other passage, the rest of the hieroglyphs copied by Seler, however, do not correspond to the remaining ones in Bre- ton's paintings. Furthermore, Seler makes no ref- erence to figures, but only to walls "decorated with a smooth stucco layer" and the "remains of hieroglyphs executed in red color" (1902-23: 403, my translation). Seler's drawings, with readings by Thompson (1962) and the author, are repro- duced in Fig. 47. 53 No other information regard- the eastern corner of the stucco relief of the Palace. She does not explain what she means by "human dust," but does indi- cate that she found "no trace of burial or cremation." The material she was sifting must have been the fill used to cover the passage between the two buildings when they were lev- eled in ancient times. 53 Seler s reading of the hieroglyphs he copied follows (num- bers in parentheses refer to my plate numbers): They are in part well-known signs. Thus we have in pl. 7 [Fig. 47c] and in pl. 8 A, 2 [Fig. 47d], as also possibly in pl. 8B, 1 [Fig. 47d], the animal with the sharp nose and the flaming tongue which probably represents the hound thrown from the sky, the lightning animal. In pl. 8A, 3 [Fig. 47d] the been-kak group, which in all likelihood is to be read either "conqueror" or "lord" (Mexican: tepeuh or tepeuani), is recognized. In pl. 8B, 2 [Fig. 47d], we have the day sign imix, attached to the stone knife element, in pl. 9, 3 [Fig. 47c], the day sign akbal; in pl. 5 [Fig. 47a], the day sign ahau, in pl. 6 [Fig. 47b], the uinal mol (Seler 1902-23: 403-404; my translation). John Justeson (personal communication, 1981) points out that Seler anticipated Lounsbury (1973) in reading the ben-ich (Se- ler's been-kak) compound as "lord, " although without the nec- essary supporting linguistic and epigraphic evidence. 58</page><page sequence="65">I o §2 U OD o « £ ™ E ™ g t; § T3 ^ § &lt; § ^ o o pq ^ o ^ &gt;-&gt; « § ° &amp;s &gt;.s . .ti &lt;-&gt; coM '0 ui &lt;u v * 3 J2 v * ^ u- O VO O N SP « « Lu £ 00 « 11 &lt;D &lt;D »■* C/J PQ 3 «2 &lt; 2 C/l t-l X&gt; OQ .

After Seler 1902-23: pls. 5-9. ing the original location of the painted hiero- glyphs is provided by Seler. Since one of the texts reproduced by Seler (Fig. 47d) also appears near the top of Breton's copy of the mural (Fig. 44, D-E), it is just possible that the entire wall was not yet uncovered at the time of Seler's first visit to Acanceh, and that he viewed only the upper portion of the mural. Although Bre- ton's account of the frieze's discovery was the first to be published, in 1908, both Breton and Seler were at the site the year before. If Breton's pro- longed stay at Acanceh followed Seler's first visit in 1907, she (or others) may have cleared the cham- ber. But two of Seler's drawings of the hieroglyphs (Fig. 47a, b) were done in 191 1, presumably after Breton copied the figures, suggesting that not all of the texts were associated with the murals. Writing in 191 1 (p. 1024), Seler mentions continuing de- struction of the Palace the previous year, so perhaps the painted walls seen by Breton were gone by then. Nevertheless, if the figures were visible at all between 1907 and 191 1, their absence from any published accounts remains puzzling. The structure in which the murals were painted almost certainly predates the Pure Florescent build- ing which was in ruins when the Acropolis was first explored. If, as has been suggested, the murals were located in Structure 2, they were proba- 60</page><page sequence="67">bly painted shortly after the construction of the Palace of the Stuccoes. Structure 2 has been dated slightly later than the Palace of the Stuccoes, on the basis of architectural comparisons with Struc- ture 57 at Dzibilchaltun (Andrews and Andrews 1980: 146). Structure 57's suggested date is toward the end of Early Period II, around 10. 0.0. 0.0 (ca. a.d. 830). Structure 2 at Acanceh, then, could be as early as the seventh century a.d., if an Early Period II date is accepted for the Palace of the Stuc- coes, or as late as the ninth century. Although it is unfortunate that the exact location and context of the murals can no longer be determined, their sig- nificance as one of the few examples of northern Maya wall painting should not be overlooked. The original disposition of the figures repre- sented in the three Breton watercolor copies is not known, although the accompanying annota- tion indicates they are from a single room. While all three are framed at the top with one or more bands of reddish-brown hue, only one scene also has a vertical margin of color (Fig. 44). This may mark the beginning or ending of a scene, or the corner of a room. Also present in the three scenes is a ground line, which, in the case of Figs. 45 and 46, has vertical lines below it suggesting the legs of a bench or platform. Figure 44 represents two standing figures, one facing and gesturing to his left, the other, at a slightly higher level, bending away from his com- panion in a frontal or three-quarter view. Both are painted chocolate brown with touches of gray, red, and blue remaining in their costumes and headdresses. The feathers of the right-hand fig- ure's headdress appear to sweep down over the shoulder of the left-hand figure, just touching a bulbous white and yellow object which may rep- resent the top of a staff or part of a necklace.54 The position of the left-hand figure's head is un- clear: where the viewer might expect to find it, in profile facing left, there is instead a T-shaped ele- ment that continues up from the figure's bent right arm and does not conform to the outlines of the head. Lower down, between the figure's leg and two hieroglyphs, is an intriguing flesh-col- 54 Cf. the Spondylus shells worn by the lords of Bonampak in Room 1, discussed in M. Miller (1986: 62-63). ored shape hinting at the presence of another fig- ure at his feet. The text above the two figures is the best pre- served and clearest of those copied by Breton; glyphs D1-E2 were also copied, although less ac- curately, by Seler (Fig. 47d). According to John Justeson (personal communication, 1984), they are the remains of a Long Count date of three rows and six columns (A1-F2), followed by additional material at E3-F3 and by at least two (and perhaps four) additional columns of indeterminate length. The preserved glyphs would have formed part of the fourth and fifth columns (D-E). The third Lord of the Night, G3, occurs at Di, followed by a record of 18D (the 18th day of the lunar month) in D2(-C3?). A form of Glyph X seems to occur at Ei, followed by the remains of Glyph B (in barest outline) at Fi. At E2, either glyph A9 or A 10 (indi- cating that the lunar month had 29 or 20 days re- spectively) appears, and would have been followed by the month position at F2. The non-calendrical portion of the text probably began at E3. This part of the text is unfortunately the least informative for anchoring the date chronologically. However, the occurrence at G3 of the Lords of the Night shows at least that the date is historical, referring to an event; had it been a period ending date, the Lord of the Night would have been G9. Only one sign in the non-calendrical portion of the text remains, a variant of T747K at Gi. Mat- hews and Justeson (1984) indicate that this sign functions exclusively as the preposition ti (or cog- nate), most frequently in chronological state- ments and statements of accession. At the lower left of the scene there is a column of at least two glyphs: the upper one (Ii) appears to be 505 ( akbal ) with a prefix of 747, T125, T126, or T128, but may also be the same hiero- glyph copied by Seler (Fig. 47b, 3) and identified by Thompson as 172?. 505. Otherwise, Seler's col- umn of four glyphs cannot be matched by any of the hieroglyphs in the Breton drawings. The second watercolor (Fig. 45) represents an- other standing figure, of whom the upper torso and part of the right leg remain. In contrast to the dark color of the figures in Figure 44, he is painted a lighter flesh tone. He appears to stand in 61</page><page sequence="68">Fig. 48 Bonampak, west wall, Room 1. After M. Miller 1986: pl. 6. a frontal position, head in profile to his right, although some torsion is suggested by the curv- ing outline of the body, the hint of the left arm's outline across the chest, and the position of the beaded jade collar, as if the shoulders are turned. The figure's headdress of carefully delineated feathers sweeps forward to frame an unusual head- piece. Instead of the more common deity mask motif, there is a grotesque blue human head, pos- sibly enclosed within the open jaws of a monster or animal. Either forming part of the enclosing helmet or protruding from the human's mouth are short green feathers. The features of the hu- man head are distinctly non-Maya. The head, in fact, bears some resemblance to the small human heads, possibly shrunken, worn by two of the parasol bearers in Room 1 at Bonampak (Fig. 48, right). Whether this is a trophy head cannot be proven, but it does not resemble any known Maya deity. Nor can its vivid blue hue be easily explained. Patches of blue and red, perhaps parts of the figure's costume, can be seen near his re- maining foot and leg. Opposite his shoulders are flesh-colored areas, the largest including a yellow- ish oval, that again hint at the presence of a sec- ond participant. Only a few scattered hieroglyphs remain in this scene; it is not clear whether they formed part of larger texts or merely served as brief captions for the figures represented. At the upper left there is a hieroglyph marked with a caban sign (A2); it may have been a profile head, such as the T1004 fe- male head variant. The affixes are not very clear, although the postfix may be T 129. The two hieroglyphs painted on the gray patch in the center of the scene are much clearer. The first (Ei) is T669, read cha/ka, with affixes of T130 and T126. Although there are numerous ex- amples of the combination T 126. 669: 130. 126, a verbal expression (Scheie 1982: 206), this particu- lar verbal pattern ^669:130.126) has not been identified. Since chah means mutilated or crippled 62</page><page sequence="69">a b Fig. 49 Chacmultun mural, Room i, Building 3: (a) upper register, left side, detail; (b) upper register, middle, detail. Copy by Martine Fettweis, after Mayer 1990: pls. 22, 24. in Yucatec (Barrera Vasquez 1980: 75), this may well be a bloodletting expression whose protago- nist is named in the next glyph (E2) (John Juste- son, personal communication, 1984). It appears to be T56ib:23, read caan, sky, with T23, na, acting as a phonetic complement. Sky names and titles figure prominently at a number of Maya sites; in this case, this phrase could refer to auto-sacrifice by one of the participants in the scene. Finally, Ci, just behind the feather headdress, looks somewhat like T764, the Chicchan head that is not only a day sign but also the main sign for both the so-called "captor" glyph and the Em- blem Glyph of El Peru. Unfortunately, the condi- tion of the text makes it impossible to determine the meaning and context of this particular exam- ple of the hieroglyph. In the last watercolor (Fig. 46), there is a figure standing in profile to the viewer's left, with one arm (represented by two brown patches) held out behind him. Despite the fragmentary condition of the image and the static position of the figure's legs, the scene is full of movement. The sweeping backward gesture is balanced by the swath of blue across the torso and the forward movement of the large feather headdress. Between the two large areas of blue appears a serpentine element in red, whose design recalls some of the painted, dyed, or woven textiles in the Bonampak murals. Its relationship to the figure, however, is unclear. There were some hieroglyphs associated with this scene, notably to the left and right of the figure's legs, but they are not legible as copied, nor can they be matched with Seler's remaining drawings (Fig. 47a, c, and e). Stylistic Comparisons and Dating of the Murals Only a handful of murals survive in the north- ern Maya area, and most of these are of Post- Classic date.55 The extant mural that most resem- bles the Acanceh paintings may be that of Chac- multun, a Puuc site not far from Tekax (Fig. 49). The mural, described by Kubler (1984: 279) as the work of a "provincial and retardaire school of Late Classic date," has a military theme: armed warriors, captives, and possibly even a skirmish are represented.56 The varied skin tones and rela- tively simple clothing of the participants, as well as their proportions and twisting body positions, are not unlike the Acanceh figures. The structure in which the Chacmultun mural is housed, how- ever, although greatly destroyed even at the turn of the century, appears to be a Puuc style building and should therefore be later than either of the structures which may have contained the Acanceh 55 For a useful survey of paintings in the northern Maya area, see Paxton (1986: app. 1.1 and pls.). 56 Although E. H. Thompson's color reproduction, done around 1899, is more complete, M. Fettweis' is more accurate. 63</page><page sequence="70">murals (E. H. Thompson 1904: pl. v; Pollock 1980: 366). A more complete Late Classic mural is found at another Puuc site, Mulchic. Unlike Chacmultun, which appears to lack inscriptions, this mural has hieroglyphic texts painted both above the upper border of the scenes and next to some of the partici- pants (Pina Chan 1962, 1964: figs. 1-3). Short hiero- glyphic texts placed near and perhaps identifying the figures are more typical of polychrome ceram- ics and Bonampak than of northern Maya wall paintings.57 The texts at both Mulchic and Acanceh were painted with a dark red-brown pigment on a white or cream background. As at Chacmultun, a battle and its aftermath are represented, but the scenes are both more complex and more skillfully rendered. Some of the participants wear grotesque masks and headdresses, although none resemble the headdress worn by the figure represented in Figure 45. The Mulchic headdresses, while elaborate, gen- erally lack the broad panaches of long sweeping feathers worn by the Acanceh figures. Not far from Chacmultun, the murals of Dzula also include processional figures standing on dif- ferent kinds of ground lines (E. H. Thompson 1904: pl. 11). The Dzula scenes, however, are di- vided into registers and include simply dressed seated and kneeling figures, others holding bas- kets, and architecture. They are more reminiscent of the paintings at Chichen Itza, however, than of the Acanceh images. There is one last mural in the northern low- lands that if in better condition might have pro- vided a closer analogy to Acanceh. Five profile figures in procession and the remains of hiero- glyphs are found at Coba in the El Cuartel struc- ture (Fig. 50). From the little that can be seen of the remains, the figures have the same propor- tions, brown flesh, relatively simple costumes, and elaborate headdresses as the Acanceh figures. Comparisons with the better-known mural cy- cle of Bonampak are inevitable. The admittedly broad period of time during which the Acanceh structures could have been built could coincide 57 This may be due to problems in preservation, although the northern area in general lacks a large corpus of hiero- glyphic writing. 64 Fig. 50 Coba, mural on north wall in north room, El Cuartel Structure. Processional figure 1. After Lom- bardo de Ruiz 1987: fig. 72. with the Bonampak murals, painted in a conserva- tive style toward the end of the eighth century. In any case, the Acanceh murals share certain con- ventions with those of the Usumacinta site. The bands of red above the figures recall those that divide the Bonampak walls into registers. The large, sweeping feathered headdresses seem more like those worn by some of the Bonampak figures than by the warriors at Chacmultun, for example. These figures are taller and slimmer than their more heavy-set counterparts at Bonampak, how-</page><page sequence="71">ever. Finally, if the Acanceh paintings formed part of a continuous frieze, it may have represented a processional scene comparable to that represented in Room i at Bonampak (Fig. 48). With so little remaining of the images, and with their archaeological context uncertain, the dating of the Acanceh murals is as problematic as that of the stucco facade. Nevertheless, on stylis- tic grounds, they are almost certainly Late rather than Early Classic: the figures' poses and cos- tumes conform much more closely to Bonampak conventions than to those of, for example, the Early Classic mural discovered in Uaxactun B- XIII (Smith 1950: fig. 46). The style of the hiero- glyphs, too, appears to be of the latter part of the Late Classic (John Justeson, personal communica- tion, 1984). The murals leave us with an intriguing glimpse of ritual life at Acanceh. With the inventory of Maya murals in the Yucatan peninsula currently being undertaken (Fettweis 1983: 53-54; Paxton 1986: app. 1.1; Lombardo de Ruiz 1987), the docu- mentation of existing wall paintings and the dis- covery of new ones may shed light on the context and meaning of the rediscovered wall paintings of Acanceh. 65</page><page sequence="72">Bibliography Aguilera, Carmen 1985 Flora y fauna mexicana: Mitologia y tradiciones.
