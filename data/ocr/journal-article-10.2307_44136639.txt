First of all, his poetry is a summation of the literary tradition up to his time. Huang Tingjian ftJIli? (1045-1105) famously remarked that in Du Fu s poems, "there is no word that does not derive from elsewhere" The vast richness of Du Fus language was not produced de novo but drawn from the whole cultural tradition up to his time, so that his work can serve as a kind of distillation of Chinese civilization up to the An Lushan rebellion. Du Fu s work definitively established enduring forms and conventions of Chinese poetry. Yet his influence extended far beyond literary tradition; as a Confucian culture hero, Du Fu was a personal role model and inspiration for many. Who can forget the preface to William Hung s biography of the poet, where he explains how his father recom- mended to him Du Fu as a character model, and further how, while imprisoned by the Japanese in 1942, he vowed to devote himself to the study of Du Fu once he was released?2 Indeed, Du Fu haunted other scholars driven into flight by the Japanese occupation. Hsiao Kung-chuan ff (1897-1981), later an eminent scholar of Chinese political thought at the University of Washington, wrote a poem in 1937 titled "Passing Kuizhou by Boat" jt[&gt; comparing his own journey to Du Fu s sojourn in Kuizhou from 766 to 768. The poem opens:3 jÊSLtBttá: Lord Du departed from these gorges while taking refuge from war; SScfxHSL On my journey I have entered these gorges because of war. At a time of personal, national, and indeed global crisis, Hsiao found Du Fu s example a powerful point of reference for his own situation. Despite the ravages of war, or more literally, luán üL&gt; "chaos," the upsetting of the social and moral order, it remains possible to reassert the authority of the poet-historian Du Fu, an authority won through personal hardship and refuge in remote Sichuan, as much as by literary prowess or Confucian virtue.</page><page sequence="2">202 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 In spite of his enduring legacy within Chinese culture, Du Fu has not been well served by Western scholarship. Arthur Waley famously avoided translating his poetry, and he was probably wise to do so. It has proven remarkably difficult to represent Du Fu s literary virtues in English. William Hung's excellent biographical study makes no attempt to translate the poetry with precision. Though there have been valuable studies of individual works,4 the only comprehensive translation of Du Fus poems into a Western language heretofore was Erwin von Zachs (1872- 1942) Tu Fus Gedichte , actually a posthumous compilation of translations previ- ously published in various venues.5 Von Zachs translations have been criticized for their lack of poetry, but they can be extremely helpful to students precisely because of the prosaic transitions and explications which make sense of Du Fu s poems as coherent wholes.6 Another learned and reliable translation of Du Fus shi poems was completed by the great Japanese sinologist Suzuki Torao (1878- 1963)/ Nonetheless many of Du Fus poems were until now unavailable in English, and only a few had ever been translated into English accurately. Thus the first full translation of Du Fu s poems into English is a major event, and everyone involved in the study of Chinese literature owes Stephen Owen a great debt. That his edition of Du Fus poems includes helpful annotation, such as explanatory footnotes, scholarly endnotes pointing out variants and justifying interpretations, and a guide to major allusions, makes it an invaluable scholarly tool. Moreover, the online version is open access, making it even more convenient for students and poetry lovers alike. This bilingual edition is the first in a promis- ing new series, the Library of Chinese Humanities, which imitates the format of the Loeb Classical Library. The Poetry of Du Fu is a monumental achievement that deserves to be studied in detail and also examined with care. It may seem churlish, when reviewing a volume of nearly three thousand pages, to point out that something has been overlooked, but since the back cover explicitly claims that this publication contains "the first complete translation of the poetry of Du Fu" and "the entirety of Du Fus works," it seems worth noting that this is not precisely true. Owen does include all the shi poems (excepting a few of dubious authorship), and even translates poems addressed to Du Fu by other poets that were included in his collected works. Moreover, Owen translates all of Du Fu s fu as well, and even a single tetrasyllabic "Encomium for a Horse Painting" iĒMĀ • However, there are also some omissions. These are the com- positions in the wen category of Du Fus collected works, juan 25 of Qiu Zhaoaos fÀi'ËH (1638-1717) Du shi xiangzhu These include four poetic epitaphs in tetrasyllabic verse, which properly ought to have been included. It is true that von Zach omitted them as well, and these works are usually not described as "poetry" in English, due to the quaint twentieth-century convention that only shi are poetry. But these are also literary compositions in rhyming verse, that is, poems, and should not be neglected because of antiquated bibliographical conventions.</page><page sequence="3">Features 203 Nonetheless, this is by far the most comprehensive translation of Du Fu into English or indeed any language that I know of, and as such is a major milestone in Western sinology. Read in its entirety, moreover, The Poetry of Du Fu is revealed not simply to be a translation but very much an original interpretation of Du Fu s work. The decision to translate the complete poetry is itself distinctive; Owen has argued eloquently in numerous venues that our readings of Du Fu have been filtered through the choices of editors and anthologists. Similarly, Owen includes detailed collation notes that account for all the earliest variants and represent Du Fu in filli detail. Owens translation style, which tends consistently to bare simplic- ity, rendering many lines as conjunctions of syntactic fragments, is also a distinc- tive choice. In contrast to the starkness of the translation, Owen is generous with commentary placing the poems in biographical context. While following the preexisting arrangement of the poems in the Du shi xiangzhuy he adds numerous headnotes explaining the historical background. Though Owen has translated all of Du Fus extant poems in the shi and fu IS genres, his approach tends to highlight certain types of poem and a few poetic voices within Du Fu, and it is in this sense that these volumes form a coher- ent interpretation of Du Fus work. This is an interpretation that places relatively little weight on Du Fu s inheritance from the poetic tradition, say, or on his forma- tion by the Confucian intellectual tradition. It finds instead his distinctive achieve- ment in his attention to his immediate surroundings and experiences throughout his travels, above all in the rural settings of Sichuan. To give a rough taste of what I mean, it is a representation of Du Fu in which poems like the following assume a dominant position: 20.628 Singing My Feelings on Finishing Cutting the Rice X!H@TR m ' Rice harvested, the clouds and waters are left bare, j [ [zpiyçpEj o the level stream faces Stonegate. ' Cold winds strip the plants and trees, jfi 0 0 in the dawn sun chickens and pigs scatter. ' Weeping in wilderness, I first hear of a battle, 0 wood-gatherers' songs gradually emerge from the village. ' I have no family about whom to ask of news, fp o as a wayfarer, I trust myself to Earth and Heaven. Far off we hear of battles and of the larger world of politics, but Du Fus attention is fixated on the mundane details of rural life, presented in Owens translation as stark conjunctions of visual images. Erwin von Zach, following in the method of some Qing dynasty commentators, attempts to draw out more of the realistic logic in the poem, interpreting the first line more naturalistically: "After the paddy harvesting (the fields are empty and) one sees nothing but clouds and water . . ." and explaining that the chickens and pigs are scattering in search of any rice kernels that have been left on the ground.9 By contrast, Owen follows the precise</page><page sequence="4">204 China Review International: Vol. 2i, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 order and syntax of the Chinese very closely, refraining to interpolate logical connections or deeper implications. This poem was always there in Du Fu s collected works and was even translated previously into English by Florence Ayscough.10 But Owens translation gives new prominence to this particular style of Du Fu s: the plain and even bland diction, the parallel couplets that jot down pastoral scenes with a few distinct images, and the presentation of personal emo- tion incidentally by means of mundane detail. In a sense, this Du Fu is "singing his feelings" not just after "cutting the rice" but precisely by means of such pastoral activities. After the frustrations of his career and the failures of the Tang state, Du Fu finds purpose as the chronicler of incidental trivia. This Du Fu remains a great poet but also a rebuke to the Confucian "poet-sage" of later hagiography, being poet-diarist rather than transmitter-sage. That this is the gist of Owens interpretation is stated clearly on the back cover of the volumes: The entirety of Du Fu s works provides a more nuanced portrait of the author than the standard selections. It provides testimony of the rebellion of 755, but also includes poems on building a chicken coop and repairing bamboo plumbing. In the whole we discover how the sublime and the quotidian are united in a larger vision of life. This strikes me as a very accurate encapsulation of the volumes' interpretation of Du Fu, with the caveat that the emphasis ultimately lies more on the "quotidian" than the "sublime."11 In fact, Owen systematically undercuts the more sublime moments of Du Fu s oeuvre, as when he renders the final couplet of the canonical "Spring Prospect" as "Ive scratched my white hair even shorter, / pretty much to the point where it wont hold a hatpin" ÖSSSr j5í§ ' (4.25.7-8; my emphasis). This translation is accurate, and a certain self-mockery is part of Du Fu s poetic persona to begin with. At the same time, when the prosody of pentasyllabic regulated verse is so constricting, the abrupt insertion of a five- word phrase expressing the concept of "almost" is striking. It jerks the reader abruptly out of that grand world of kingdoms at war, the travails and tragedies of history, into a more quotidian realm altogether. The triumph of the quotidian implicit in "pretty much to the point" stands out particularly in contrast to the normal style of Owen's translation, which seeks very much to follow the original text of Du Fus poems, with each substantive English word representing a single Chinese character or frequently even a com- pound. In dramatic contrast to von Zachs or most previous English translations, Owen attempts what we might call a "diaphanous" translation, a translation in which the English text is a thin layer of gauze draped closely over the Chinese text, often allowing the reader to perceive the original contours of Du Fus phras- ing. This sort of translation is well suited to the audience Owen has envisioned for this translation: "the primary audience are those who have some level of Chi- nese, but whose Chinese is not up to reading Du Fu" (i:lxxxi). In keeping with</page><page sequence="5">Features 205 the bilingual format, Owen seems to envision the reader frequently scanning back and forth, using the English to parse the Chinese or the Chinese to supplement the English. It is worth asking, however, whether a diaphanous translation is appropriate for the multifarious intricacies of Du Fu s text. The superficial array of the Chinese characters is only one feature of the poems, and by no means necessarily the most important in comparison to the specific objects those words were chosen to represent, the historical world in which Du Fu s experiences and poems are set, and the rich body of cultural and literary allusion suggested either implicitly or explicitly within those lines. To trace each of these diverse layers of signification in English, the most natural solution is a scholarly approach with detailed annotation and accurate identification of names and things. And indeed this translation is for the most part a very scholarly translation, adorned not only with footnotes on nearly every page but also endnotes and appendices. Yet the diaphanous quality of the translation proper and the scholarly ambitions of the volumes as a whole occasionally come into conflict, when the quotidian surface of Du Fu s narration is replicated so literally as to occlude the incalculable depths. The scholarly translation is a genre that operates under different rules from a literary translation, with its Procrustean strictures of the belle and fidèle. A scholarly translation must satisfy the needs of diverse audiences, from students looking for a crib, to curious readers just skimming by, to other scholars curious about a particular interpretation. To satisfy these purposes, in my view, a scholarly translation ought to display three principal qualities, namely, to be accurate, idiomatic, and informative. Accuracy is the sine qua non, since the whole purpose is to give a sense of the meaning of the original poems. At the same time, though, the translation ought to reflect the various stylistic idioms of the sources: you cannot translate a drinking song in the same manner as a ceremonial ode. More- over, there is so much cultural background to Du Fu, ranging from the poems that he had read and the classics he had memorized, to the places he visited and the friends he met, that one can hardly present just the bare text of his poems in translation. They require footnotes, introductions, and other explanatory material. These three criteria represent some fundamental desiderata for a translation of the poetry of Du Fu. Accuracy in translation requires both comprehension of the original and successful re-creation of a parallel text in English. Long before this publication, Owen was already one of the foremost experts on Du Fu in the Western world. Du Fu figured prominently in his classic studies Remembrances: The Experience of the Past in Classical Chinese Literature and Traditional Chinese Poetry and Poetics : The Omen of the World,12 and the chapter on Du Fu in The Great Age of Chinese Poetry : The High Tang is a splendid, concise survey of Du Fu s poetic style.13 Throughout this translation Owen displays a surpassingly firm grip over</page><page sequence="6">2o6 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 the contents and contexts of Du Fiťs poems. For one thing, he has been very careful to use the earliest texts of the poems. As detailed collation notes to each volume explain, he has generally followed Song editions and in many cases rejected the emendations of Qiu or other Qing editors. To this reader's taste, some of these emendations make better poetry, but I still admire Owens rigor- ous approach to the text. Owen has also consulted much recent Chinese scholar- ship and made a thorough attempt to identify usages special to the Tang and translate them accurately. Though readers might disagree with a particular interpretation of a difficult line, in most cases Owen's views have their own justification. Yet in his translation of individual vocabulary terms Owen is not always precise. Where Du Fu uses a range of vocabulary to describe objects with the utmost specificity, Owen tends to use a more general term. The very first poem in Du Fus collection, "Visiting Fengxian Temple at Longmen" (1.1), emphasizes the disyllabic word zhaoti ÍSJI, a loan word from the Sanskrit catur-deśika, by repeating it twice within the first couplet. It would be natural to render it using some term with extra weight in English, like "sanctuary," but Owen instead translates flatly: "I had already visited the temple / and went on to stay over in the temple precincts" EífêíSíiBS ' MíãíSíêÔt (1.1.1-2). The trans- lation of zoological or botanical terms is not always exact. For instance, Owen writes "mandarin ducks" $§$§ (9.14.6) when this is another variety of waterfowl larger than a mandarin duck, perhaps the shelduck ( Tadorna tadorna). Citrus fruits are nearly always "oranges," like gan (19.17.15), properly the mandarin orange or sweetpeel tangerine ( Citrus reticulata). In the case of "tangerines" (14.60.3), Du Fu actually includes pomelo as well. A "staff" fetü (4.15.9) should be a goosefoot staff, since Du Fu has been kind enough to identify the material for us. Various kinds of luminosity are referred to uniformly as "glows," as in "sun in bamboo, pure and glowing" S (10.11.4), even though bamboo is not normally seen to glow. Descriptive binômes like huihui HÇHÇ here are usually translated with a single word, as in "all I can do is hurry away" (1.35.36).14 Various terms are translated uniformly when they ought to be rendered appropriately to context, like "tangled rock" ÜLS (3.23.4) rather than jumbled rocks, or "blue clouds" üf® (5.27.35) rather than clouds in the blue sky. Several different verbs, like dong ļftj and ji are rendered too often as the ambiguous "stir," for example: "the Airs and Sao are both praised and stirred" MllS^íliíÉfc (3.41.16); "My long songs stir the roof-beams" (4.16.47); "I gather my books and stir the jade zither" (20.39.6); "once she danced the sword dance, she stirred the world around" - MMluirWjPSJj (20.102.2); and "Stirred and consequently carrying through" (6:253).15 Ye gp is always "wilderness," even in adjectival position, as in "wilderness temple" 5?^f (3.1.2) or "a wilderness inn" (6.7.5). Qing is nearly always "clear," as in "about to close it, I hear the</page><page sequence="7">Features 207 clear fulling blocks" łtó (20.39.8), where it means "immaculate," or "clear feast" ýjf (4.16.57) where it means "elegant." Words are often translated according to their most common meaning rather than the specific usage, as in "my body old, I cannot forbid sorrow" (23.47.4). Stars and constellations, whose lore in Du Fu s poetry could easily fill a monograph, are treated cursorily: "The Gouchen stars are in the vast blue, the Xuanwu stars are setting" (4.1.19).16 Some common nouns are simply romanized, like "yao plant" (1.19.12) for "jasper [or other precious gem] grasses," " tiao " (2.3.3) for "ancestral temple," "fuling" (6.44.2) for "tuckahoe,"17 " chequ gems" JļiŠfl (11.56.26) for "coral gems," referring to the exotic stone musāragalva , or " yuanju " §§§§ (23.19.7) for "frigate bird."18 Owen also has a curious penchant for understatement, as in the "hundred-yard well-rope" (8.10.4), which should actually be a thousand feet, or "a six-foot body" AKIB (15-64.19), which is actually eight feet tall (the Tang measure chi happening to coincide nicely with the English foot). Similarly, the vigorous "tumbleweed" becomes a "dandelion puff" Ü (1.24.1), often with comic effect, as in "The dandelion puff does not grow without roots" (6.39.1). Periodically some anachronistic terminology slips in as well, like "cultural transformation" (3-35-43) for "moral sway." The gates of recluses are "ram- shackle" Hf^, implying that they are poorly constructed or maintained, rather than humble rural dwellings (e.g., 9.72.4), 19 and the "fleabane [houses] and wicker [doors]" ÜrÍjl of a recluse like Ge Hong (283-343) are translated as "shack- dweller" (1.22.11).20 One of Owen's innovations is to translate kuai (also written to specify fish) as "sashimi," as in the poem "Sheriff Jiang (7) of Wenxiang Serves Sashimi: I Playfully Present Him This Song in Long Lines" (6.46).21 This term properly means "minced meat, fish, or vegetables."22 Kuai may sometimes refer to raw meat or fish, but the specific preparation is unclear. It might have been closer to namasu , which is one current reading of both characters m or it in Japanese. This is a dish of raw fish or meat prepared with vinegar and often vegetables, which is quite ancient. In fact, the modern Japanese version is not dissimilar to that described by Li Shizhen (1518-1593).23 Sashimi, by contrast, appeared first in the Edo period, and as presently consumed primarily uses saltwater fish. I am skeptical that this is sashimi for another reason, which is that the fish is described in line 7 of the same poem as "shattered snow" Raw fish is of course translucent, and only turns a snowy white after cooking. Incidentally, it is possible to cook fish without the application of heat, simply by marinating it in some kind of citric acid. Thus it is at least equally likely that the preparation involved here was closer to that of ceviche. The cautious translator would simply refer to this preparation as "diced" or "minced" fish. Some other translations of specific terms are discussed in the marginalia noted later in this review.</page><page sequence="8">2o8 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 Next, with regard to syntax, Owen generally follows the surface structure of the Chinese closely. In the famous poem "Gazing on the Peak" (1.2) on the first page of this translation, the second couplet is rendered: Creation compacted spirit splendors here, Dark and Light, riving dusk and dawn. The compressed syntax and alliteration here are highly effective, with something of the flavor of Gerard Manley Hopkins. At the same time, because Owen does not specify the subject of "riving," nor the grammatical relations of "Dark and Light," the different components of the couplet hang fire while the reader struggles to make them comprehensible. Owen himself once produced a more lucid version: "Here Creation concentrated unearthly glory, / Dark north slope, the sunlit south divide dusk and dawn."24 In the new version, an endnote does explain the tradi- tional interpretation as referring to southern and northern slopes of the mountain, but is not reflected in the translation.25 Thus Owen has made a choice to pare down any additional or explanatory material in the translation and follow the Chinese text as literally as possible. In other cases, though, this stripped-down syntax can lead the reader astray, as in the next poem, "Climbing the Wall-Tower at Yanzhou" (1.3). Owen renders the third couplet: The Qin stele is still there on the lonely cliff, an overgrown wall, ruins of the Lu palace. The two lines are parallel with the main verbs zai ~%E "is there" and yu "remains," respectively. Wanting to vary the syntax of the translation, Owen renders the latter verb as a noun, "ruins." But because he has excised the second verb, the sole verb of the entire couplet seems to be the copula in the first line. But then the contents of the second line ought also to be read as subjects of the same main verb modified by the same adverbial phrase: stele, wall, and palace ruins all hang- ing precariously onto the same lonely cliff. In fact, of course, the two lines are parallel, so Owens translation might be revised as follows: On a lonely cliff the Qin stele remains; In an abandoned city the Lu palace lies in ruins. Though superficially Owens translation seems to be faithful to the Chinese syntax, it is actually simplified to the point that it obscures grammatical relations that were originally quite transparent. The same translation technique leads to fragmented syntax throughout these volumes, for example: "When will there be a goblet of ale / discussing writings fine points again with you?" fnfB# - ' » fiíÊÇIElÉX (1.28.7-8); "rare of feather, a hawk sometimes presented" (1.31.10); "for skill in the classics, Han officials employed" (1.34.4); "wisteria branches fresh, poking eyes" llfëMISfr (3.1.6); "Song When Drunk" (3.10); "by lingering here I</page><page sequence="9">Features 209 comfort my enforced travels" B58§SÌIi3fÌ (13.23.32). Owen shows a strong resis- tance to prepositions, giving us "secret plots, he alone held the potter's wheel" ļHUk (2.31.34); "Banner- tassles, krakens and dragons assemble" (11.3.9); "spring trees in Willing, others lose the way" (18.62.6); and "Mountain homes, steamed chestnuts warm, / wilderness meal, shot venison fresh" ' Sřf5lífII$T (20.58.3-4), etc. He avoids inserting pronominal subjects, creating "spring goes far away, only my ramshackle house" (14.41.4); "in a strange place, the pleasures of this day" (14.59.2); and "Yellow oranges heavy, put on the platter" (20.67.5). Main verbs are frequently omitted or transformed into stative ones: "ten thousand points, Shu mountains sharp" (3.18.4); "his lance-work swift, ten thousand hurrahs" (3.36.8); "A cloud in flight, jade when standing, entirely clear autumn" (18.31.1);26 "His recent writings, a living Shen or Xie" ff (17.68.3); "in metamorphosis, Leviathan and Peng" üftW Uli (22.28.8). Owen also mechanically translates de Í# as "get," leading to solecisms: "I escaped and got to flee west" JJ£:iH#ÎS7Ë (5.8.4); "how can I get with bare feet to walk on its layered ice?" (6.33.8); "The times are troubled and how could one get to truly bring such as these" (9.37.7). Some- times an awkward zeugma surfaces: "I choke back my voice and pace" (3.13.24), or "In green silk and white horse" Ö M (14.76.1). These examples all represent a kind of fidelity to the Chinese, but superficial fidelity can betray the true meaning, as in "short letters from old friends grow few" í&amp;ÜMliríSj (20.90.8), suggesting a plethora of lengthy missives. Sometimes Owen omits a key grammatical element that is explicit in the Chinese, as in "the cup is dry, the jug is empty" fft (14.11.26) for "When I drain the cup, the ale-jug is already empty." In any case, numerous grammatical relations are implicit in the structure of the Chinese poetic line, and an accurate translation into English ought to insert the implied subjects, verbs, and syntactical relations. Some representative examples of these issues are also mentioned in the marginalia noted later in this review. Owens clipped syntax is quite unlike the style of von Zachs translation. Though Owens version is more literal and often makes for better poetry, it is sometimes harder to follow Du Fu s argument. The following lines from "Sand Park Pasture: A Ballad" provide a good example (3.34.9-16): The king has a tiger officer in charge of the parks gate, when one enters the gate the imperial stud all mass like clouds. Sushuang steeds, of identical frame, are alone suited for imperial use twice a year, in spring and autumn, they are sent to His Majesty. Both within and without the palace His Majesty has horses up to a million, those at the trough or far off in the wilds exist in great numbers in vain. Above the common run , supreme of hoof, of truly unusual excellence , incomparably rare, remarkably powerful, hard to describe it all</page><page sequence="10">210 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 īmmenmn ' ° • «M«*# • mmm&amp;mnm ■ • The last couplet here (11. 15-16) seems to convey the improbable assertion that all the emperor's million horses are "incomparably rare." But these lines are much easier to understand as contrasting the superior "Sushuang" @§j|f horses from the common run of imperial horses. Thus von Zach renders line 15: "Those Sushuang horses are of exceptional velocity and truly superior strength" (my emphasis).27 Though von Zach may be criticized for interpolation or paraphrase, he made sense of the narrative of many of these poems in a way that remains useful even today. In spite of these limitations for certain of the translations, though, Owen does successfully translate Du Fu into a distinctive idiom of his own. Owen has written in the past of the "multiplicity" of Du Fus poetry and of the "shifting style" that appears even within individual poems.28 On one hand there are the relatively straightforward and colloquial ballads of social protest, and the meandering autobiographical epics; on the other the allusively intricate poems of historical reflection, and the densely wrought regulated verses of manifold symbolism. To mimic all these styles in English would require a translator of Shakespearian dexterity. But Owen has consistently shown an affinity for Du Fus voice, and some of his translations here bring that voice to life in English in a new and visceral fashion. A list of all the excellent translations in the book would grow long, but I might single out some of the energetic ballads like "Song of Leyou Park" (2.8), "The Army Wagons" (2.13), or the Three Officers poems (7.1-3). Owens curt and direct style is highly effective for these, helping to create a forceful rhythm to maintain energy through a long narrative. He also does a splendid job grasping the humor of occasional songs like "Unclassified Poems from Qinzhou" (7.31-50), "Strolling Alone by the Riverside, Looking for Flowers: Seven Quatrains" (10.24-30), or "Getting Rid of the Blues" (17.40-51). Similarly, Owen does an excellent job with many of the longer occa- sional poems, such as "Seeing Off Editor Li: Twenty-six Couplets" /'SB (6.19), with its poignant conclusion (11. 45-52): An old wild goose endures hunger in spring, crying out mournfully, awaiting the wheat to dry. Timely indeed are the high-flying swallows, fleet are their new-feathered wings. Long clouds soak Bao and Xie Valleys, the Han River has plenty of boulders. Do not allow your coach to be delayed and in your waning years, grieve over the past.</page><page sequence="11">Features 211 mmmm • mitmu# ° mm mmm ' mmmmm ° mmmmm ' 8I*«ïm5 « , mm^ ° As suggested above, probably the very finest of the translations are those of the domestic poems like "My Cottage Is Finished" (9.22), "Thatched Cottage" (13.39)) and "Planting Lettuce" ®§ÍÍel (15.65). Whereas Owen normally provides only laconic comment on historical context, he makes an exception for "For My Liao Slave Aduan" (i5-6), reflecting at length on the novelty of discussing a slave in ones poetry. Here is Owens translation of the first half of this poem (11. 1-4): The trees on the mountain were dark green in the glow of the setting sun, among bamboo canes slender and swaying, a thin stream can be made out. As night comes on, people of the district squabble over the last drops, but my servant sought out the source and alone didn't pay attention to them. ' s ° The syntax and style here are lucid and moving. "Made out" is perfect for fen like "squabble" for zheng fi. This casual, readable style is perfect for this kind of domestic poem, giving a clear impression of Du Fu as an individual observer of the scene. Similarly, Owen translates the end of the amusing "Ballad of Binding a Chicken" ¡jSSjUfj: "Whether chickens or bugs get the better deal is something that never will end / 1 fix my eyes on the cold river, leaning against a tower in the hills" (18.18.7-8). "Get the better deal" is a lovely translation into English vernacular representing Du Fu in a free and conversa- tional voice.29 With regard to the dense couplets for which Du Fu is also famous, Owens record is more mixed. Rather than attempting to represent them with appropriate English equivalents, he often leaves them in syntactic fragments. He punts on the famous line "hating parting, birds, alarm the heart" (4.25.4)» not even attempting to make a coherent thought out of it. But there are many splendid English couplets in the translation. For whatever reason the finest of these seem to turn up in the longer poems, whether pailü or ancient style, as in "In autumn the wild rice will form its black grains, / measures of hulled rice will convey their white glitter" (19.15.17-18), or "Winds have whipped the white wild rice frail, / dawn to dusk crimson tamarisks grow sparser" ÉI^F® $B®[| ' (20.70.9-10). Yet Owens translation is at its best, I think, not in the rendering of specific words or lines, but rather in its capturing of the voice of whole poems, of Du Fu s long ruminations about contemporary politics and war, or simply his own life and wanderings. There is not sufficient space in this review to appreciate one of these longer poems in detail, but there are certainly</page><page sequence="12">212 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 many pleasures to be had along the way of Du Fu s journeys, as guided by Stephen Owen. On the two basic dimensions of accuracy and style, then, Owen's translation is a diaphanous and accurate guide to the Chinese text of Du Fu s poems. But Du Fu s poetry also contains a vast range of historical and literary allusions, cultural allusions, intertextual borrowings, and other kinds of material that needs to be explained. This issue is independent of the quality of the translation itself, since it has to be dealt with by supplementary material. In this respect Owen has done far better than anyone might have expected for such a lengthy translation. He has provided countless footnotes explaining important background information, a twenty-five-page guide to common allusions in Du Fu s poetry that is repeated in each volume, and even copious endnotes. The collation of early variants, in par- ticular, is extremely rich. In most cases Owen does not provide literary analysis, though occasionally when he does (as in the endnotes for 2.9), it is an unexpected gift that makes one hope he will publish more extended readings of Du Fu in the future. It would have been understandable, of course, if Owen had chosen to supply even less background information. Von Zach only provides an occasional paren- thetical comment, and even Suzuki s hefty edition of the poems in Japanese rarely provides any detailed commentary beyond definitions of words and syntax of lines. Needless to say, Du Fu's dense and allusive poems could always be annotated in greater detail. Many individual lines in Du Fu contain complex allusions that reflect back on his contemporary situation, and could be glossed for pages and pages. Xiao Difei s recent edition weighs in at 7,209 pages plus two indexes in twelve volumes. A comprehensive English translation of the material contained therein would run to tens of thousands of pages. In general Owen has only given cursory glosses and provided capsule sum- maries of allusions, identifying sources intermittently and incompletely (e.g., "Hou Han shu 113," at i:375x, or simply "a story in the Zhuangzi" at 1:103 n. 2). Identifications of personages are often laconic to the point of misrepresentation, as in "Eccentric fourth-century aristocrat" (1.7/9 n. 1) for the major calligrapher and poet Wang Xianzhi iESKŻ. (344-386). Numerous figures are identified simply as writers, for example, "The poet Cao Zhi" (1.31/39 n. 6), even though in this case Cao Zhi is also cited for his role as a princely patron of poets. For whatever reason, quotations from the Analects are usually given special treatment, being quoted in full with Chinese text and identified by section number (e.g., 13.68/393 n. 7), but other sources are scanted. The other Confucian classics, in particular, are rarely mentioned. For instance, in the line "to cruelly destroy nature's creatures was lamented by the sage" Siffig (11.29.16), the quotation from the Book of Documents is not identified,30 so a casual reader might mistake this for a quotation from Confucius, when it is actually attributed therein to King Wu of Zhou. Also problematically, Owen systematically refrains from</page><page sequence="13">Features 213 mentioning or consulting previous translations of Chinese texts that could have improved his translation. The only English-language book in the bibliography is Richard John Lynns (excellent) translation of The Classic of Changes;31 Legge, Waley, Mather, Watson, etc. are never cited. Partly as a result, references to key sources are frequently incomplete or garbled. For instance, in a footnote (18.62/85 n. 1) Owen summarizes an episode from Shishuo xinyu tttiÄifffp as follows: "In the New Account of Tales of the World Wang Huizhi was an Adjutant in the Mounts section under Huan Chong When Huan asked him how many horses he was in charge of, Wang Huizhi replied that a sage did not concern himself with horses." More precisely, though, Wang Huizhi responded by quoting Analects 10/12, "[Confucius] didn't ask about the horses" ^[oļlS.32 Similarly, Du Fus occasional references to Buddhist or Daoist concepts are given only the most cursory comment, often inaccurate. Another note explains a famous episode in the Nirvāna sūtra (19.41.199/211 n. 10): "Even though the blindness was cured, he still did not know how to see." In fact, the blindness (of one hundred blind men, not just one) is cured, but their vision is still very poor, so when the doctor holds up one finger they cannot see it, but two or three fingers they can just barely discern. The point is that proper under- standing of Buddhist doctrine requires an arduous process of gradual awakening.33 Even the Wen xuan anthology, long recognized as an essential text for Du Fu and referred to on practically every page of Qiu s commentary, is mentioned only twice in all these volumes: once when Du Fu himself refers to it (14.88.10), and once in the introduction where Owen denies its pertinence (i:lxxx). Tellingly, when Du Fu quotes the opening lines of the first piece in the Wen xuan (6:241), "They may even be in the tradition of the ancient Poems" to announce the ambitions of his fu compositions, Owen does not identify it as a quotation. In the marginalia noted later in this review I discuss some other illus- trative examples. Given the constraints of an annotated translation of such a substantial corpus, this approach is understandable. Instead of simply noting these con- straints, however, Owen has instead attempted to justify this casual approach to Du Fu s sources as a deliberate methodological choice. In the introduction to the "Allusions" section that is repeated at the end of each volume, he writes (I:365X): Standard Chinese and sinological practice is to cite the earliest important source for a reference. The actual source or sources for a particular usage is [sic] considerably more various. Sometimes the poet does indeed have in mind a source text. In other cases the poet may, while knowing the original source, think of a reference through a famous later usage, where new elements may be added Often a writer is thinking of an epitome of the original text, as can be found in encyclopedias, leishu. In still other cases there are multiple sources which have come together as a "story," reference to which was so common that it transcended any particular source.</page><page sequence="14">214 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 Owen argues convincingly that the sources of medieval poets are not the same texts that modern scholars have access to. Du Fu would draw his references from a range of sources, certainly including commonplace books ( leishu ) and literary convention. Our access to the textual sources of the Tang dynasty is indeed far too limited to be able to know which particular book Du Fu was drawing from. But the conclusion Owen draws from this point is wrong. The reason that the standard humanistic practice (not merely in sinology) is to cite the earliest important source for a reference is not that scholars believe this source is what the poet had "in mind," since we so rarely, if ever, can attain knowledge of what some long-dead person was thinking. To the contrary, the reason for citation is that our knowledge is so limited and fragmentary. Thus, while it is important to recognize the difference between the sources we have today and the textual fluidity of the Tang, this point does not obviate the need to identify sources in the extant textual tradition. Similarly, in his introduction Owen explains that "In citing standard pre-modern Chinese sources I often cite the fascicle rather than the page number. Books are continually being reissued, and the fascicle number is far more likely to remain stable than a page number" (i:lxxv). But the reason to cite page numbers is not because they will be forever reliable, but pre- cisely that human knowledge is so fragmentary and transitory that it is valuable to be able to identify, at the very least, the earliest source we have for one of those fragments. An underlying principle of humanistic scholarship since the Enlightenment has been that scholarly conventions, like identifying the earliest source of quota- tions by specific page numbers, can act as a modest check to the endlessly surging tide of ignorance and error. In the statement explaining the principles behind his Dictionnaire historique et critique , Pierre Bayle (1647-1706) wrote of his hope that "These volumes thus can mortify men and rid them of their greatest vanity, which lies in the realm of science and learning. These are merely so many trophies, so many victory arches, erected to the ignorance and frailty of man."34 The reason to cite the earliest sources for Du Fus usages, particularly with regard to ambiguous or difficult lines, lies not in our knowledge but rather in our frailty. Du Fu s poetry contains so many challenges to interpretation and understanding that we should all be grateful for any points where assurance can be granted. Identifying the earliest source for a particular allusion is one isolated scrap of definite knowledge that may become useful later in unexpected ways. In fact, Owens guide to allusions itself contains an example of how identifying loci classici can clarify Du Fus usage. Owen explains the "stick adrift" ( fan geng fê|Û) allusion as follows: "In a dialogue between an earthen statue and a wooden stick, the wooden statue claimed . . ." (i:379x). The curious reader might wonder how a wooden "stick" has been transformed into a wooden "statue" mid-sentence, and so want to track down the original source, Owen's identification of which is simply "Shuo yuan 9, et aliquot In fact, the Shuo yuan version of the story refers to</page><page sequence="15">Features 215 the wooden stick thusly (mu geng 7^®), and not as a "wooden statue."35 It is the Shiji version of the story that clearly identifies the two figures as statues, or better, figurines (tu ouren ztfilgÀ and mu ouren 7fc{iSgA)-36 So the version of the story on which Owens summary is based is more likely to be that preserved in the Shi ji than the Shuo yuan, similar as the two stories are. Interesting as these two variants of the story are, it could be that the distinc- tion is irrelevant to reading Du Fu s poems. But in fact, both the Shuo yuan version and the Shiji versions of the allusion obscure a key element of the story, namely that the wooden figurine is made from the wood of a peach tree. Owens summary does mention this fact, but only once, and he always refers to this allusion as the "stick adrift." But yet another version of the story, preserved in the Zhanguo ce, presents it as a dialogue between a wooden figurine and a "stick of peach wood" (tao geng #MÜ).37 The story is the same but the protagonists are identified differ- ently. Keeping this in mind, consider the first couplet for which Owen references this allusion (1.14.21-22): ' In my decline I am the same as that stick adrift, 0 "advantageous to venture," I imagine the Coiling Peach. There is a note explaining the second line as referring to the Coiling Peach that "grows on the immortal isles in the Eastern Ocean," and also explaining the termi- nology from the Book of Changes. But Owen does not point out that the "stick adrift" is also commonly referred to as a "peach stalk," which makes this couplet seem more coherent and less fanciful.38 Not every philological detail is relevant to the interpretation of Du Fus poetry, but in many cases a thorough understanding of the sources alluded to in Du Fu s poetry can change our interpretation of his works, relating images and lines that had seemed separate. But all this depends on our theory of reference and inter- textuality. Is an allusion to an ancient text meant to summon up a whole complex of unspecified background associations, shared to varying degrees by Du Fu and his contemporaries, or does it have a straightforward meaning that is fixed within the language of Tang verse and can be summed up in a single phrase? In the introduction to the "Allusions" section, Owen continues (i:3ó5x, emphasis added): Some references are straightforward and have pretty much only one meaning or association. Others, especially references to individuals, may be contextually straightforward, but can invite confusion and misinterpretation by those who are not familiar with the habits of usage. The most common problem is knowing too much. If a soldier is called "an Achilles," it simply means that he is a skilled and daring warrior. It does not mean that he is going to die young. It would be helpful to have cited evidence for the "Achilles" example, since only a very ill-informed writer would cite Achilles "simply" meaning "a skilled and daring warrior" without having in mind his vulnerable heel, let alone his</page><page sequence="16">2i6 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 formidable capacity for anger, that anger forming the principal theme of the most famous work of European literature. However, Owen does use an example from Du Fus work to illustrate the problem of "knowing too much." This is the famous immortal "Old Deerskin" (Lupi weng who appears three times in Du Fus poetry. Owen explains that the full story of the immortal in the Shenxian zhuan lífllfPS- is quite involved, but when Du Fu cites it, he "is clearly not thinking of the full story, but only of Old Deerskin as a recluse" (i:365x). This example thus serves as a fine test case for us to examine the problem of "knowing too much." The first appearance of Old Deerskin is in the third of three poems titled "Getting Out What Stirred Me" (7.13). This poem argues that it is not important whether success comes early or late, and concludes with words of encouragement to recluses, such as Du Fu himself (11. 7-12, quotation including Owens original notes): ' I urge you gentlemen whose gates are barred:1 0 grieve not that you are still dried up. ýj ' In due time you will reveal the force of your talents, 0 sooner, or later, no matter whether fair or foul. {MlïSliJil ' I am amazed only at Old Man in Deerskin2 0 who forgets all motive facing the fragrant plants. In light of Owens explanation, then, we are to understand that the only point of information about Old Man Deerskin that is relevant to our understanding of this poem is that he is a recluse (or rather an immortal, as the note would have it- these are not precisely the same). And yet, when we consider the story of Old Man Deerskin in the Shenxian zhuan , we find that it describes him as a talented artisan who built a kind of aqueduct for a divine spring, and then went to live beside it, where "He ate mush- rooms and grasses, and drank from the divine spring" After going up to the mountaintop to live, Old Deerskin descends seventy years later to save his clan.40 He is a man of unique talent and clever mind who gives it all up to attain immortality and so quite literally the one who "forgot contrivance to live with the fragrant plants" One could argue how relevant this is for understanding the poem as a whole, let alone the set of three poems, or Du Fu s ancient-style verse, or Du Fus Weltanschauung, etc. Yet when we read the full story and compare it with these lines, we see that the elemental tensions involved in the original story are reenacted in the poem: innate cleverness versus personal satisfaction, the calm of réclusion versus fulfilled ambition, the success of worldly fame versus moral accomplishment. Without disputing Owens point that it is possible to know too much and to overread, it is also telling that the example he 1. A recluse. 2. An immortal.</page><page sequence="17">Features 217 chose to illustrate that point turns out to be its own refutation. To understand Chinese poetry we need to read these separate pieces as, in Owens words from an early article, "a complex body of complete, interanimating texts."41 The allusions of Du Fus poetry are a fundamental element of his symbolic world, and investigat- ing them is one indispensable method to understanding his work and life. What Du Fu s poems represent is not just the "sashimi" of incidental impressions, but experience transmuted into forms that endure by virtue of their broader historical resonance. In spite of my reservations, The Poetry of Du Fu is a great scholarly achieve- ment and the fruit of years of labor. In the acknowledgments to these volumes, Owen admits the toll taken by his own project by referring to Du Fu as a "black hole for time and effort" (i:vii). In calling Du Fu s poetry a black hole for time, however, Owen does an injustice to black holes, which do not annihilate time but, to the contrary, dilate it. In this sense I wonder if there is not a certain parallel to be found with Du Fu s poetry, which at its best seems to span the centuries and undo the ravages of historical time, yet most successfully so at these moments when the poet himself and his whole civilization are nearest to destruction. The black hole, too, slows the passage of time dramatically for an observer swayed by its gravitational field - although at the cost of complete destruction of anything that comes within its event horizon.42 One could cite hundreds of such examples reflecting Du Fu s highest achieve- ment, foremost among them "Autumn Meditations" (17.26-33). To give a more subtle example that shows off Owens translation at its very best, consider the long poem "In Spring of the Third Year of the Dali Reign I Set Sail from White Emperor Castle into the Qutang Gorge; Having Long Resided in Kuizhou, I Am Going to Go to Jiangling and Wrote This Poem on the Water: Forty Couplets" (21.41). While Du Fu was setting out by boat from Kuizhou toward Jiangling in the spring of 768, the boat was drenched in the rapids, and his baggage, including his own books, soaked and ruined. Rather than surrendering to depression, Du Fu instead begins to describe the scene around him (11. 33-36): ' Gulls mount on wing, as if pulled by a string, llfÍí8$$£F 0 the black dragon coils, bathing brocade. ' Descending auroras sink as green patterned silks, SláztiM 0 the dying moon breaks on the golden pivot. This is a lovely version comprising exquisite poetic formulations. Owens under- stated translation is here embellished by alliteration and internal rhyme, while smoothly preserving the vivid metaphors and juxtapositions, to make the scene seem real again for us. The river and sky around Du Fu seem to be fashioned of brocade, and even the vanishing moonlight reveals to us the golden pivot where it sets. As darkness settles all around him Du Fu perceives enduring patterns in the very darkness, forms that fix in his imagination as figures from earlier texts. On the precipice of his own destruction and fearing the loss of his own culture, the</page><page sequence="18">2i8 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 creations of his poetic imagination suggest a pattern that will endure- yet in fact the images of those beautiful brocades are no more than fictions in the mind of one individual, already facing annihilation in the black hole of history. The pro- pinquity of death gives life to art, enriched yet further by rebirth in that least intransient guise of translation. Frequently Cited Du Fu Translations Hung, William.

Marginalia In presenting these specific notes on the translation, I am mindful that "trolls take delight when a person errs" (7.52.5). Since Owen has identified his primary audience as the reader who knows some Chinese but not enough to read Du Fu, it seems useful to present the following notes for the benefit of students. There are countless cruxes in Du Fu over which one could argue at length, but in the comments below I have instead limited myself to demonstrable errors and omissions.43 1.11.6. "on the porch" is imprecise for "on the pillars of the portico." It is essential that there are pillars since that is where the painting is displayed. 1.13.3. "Unseen waters flow on the flowered paths" It seems unlikely that the paths of the estate are submerged. Von Zach inserts "neben" (p. 10). 1.14/17 n. 7. "a giant of Longbo caught six-continent-bearing turtles when fishing": Actually the turtles only carried mountains, not continents; moreover, the giant was so large that it fished out six at "one throw."44 1.31.15. "He greatly felt the kinship of sugarplum and calyx" § "Sugar- plum" is a type of candy, not a flowering tree. Moreover, "sugarplum and calyx" are not two distinct objects; this should be "the flowering plums calyces." 1.35.9-10. "For fu I reckoned to be Yang Xiong's rival; / in poems I looked on Cao Zhi as close kin" MMMMM 9 This is incorrect because fu is also a type of poem, just like shi. This fact is already implicit in this book, which is entitled the Poetry of Du Fu yet includes all the poets extant fu poems as well. 2.20.8: "we can watch them, we cannot go along" Pan means to seize onto the clouds and ride them home, a more poignant image.</page><page sequence="19">Features 219 2.37.4. "red split, rain-fattened plums' ought to be expanded into something closer to von Zachs "die durch den Regen geschwellten Pflaumen zeigen geborstene rote Oberflächen" (p. 41). 2.39.1. "Jujube tree, cold clouds color" Later in the poem the tree is described as shady, so this may be instead the Castanopsis or "chinquapin," a member of the beech family. 2.40.4. "jieli turban" âëcû: Rather, "white egret cap."45 3.10.27. "One must not hear such thoughts so gloomy" Rather, "We should not listen to such intimations of dejection and despair." 3.12.28. "it has ever been that sorrow and joy come so often!" Rather, "all along there has been so much of both sorrow and joy." The assertion that sorrow and joy "come so often" defeats the purpose of this poem on a singular experience. 3.12/135 n. 4. "Pingyi was a waster [sic] deity": Rather, "Fengyi MM was a river deity, often identified with the Lord of the Yellow River." 3.19.4. "our lord and ruler asked about Changqing" Jill®: The note here refers only to the "Sima Xiangru" allusion in the appendix (1379X), but that cap- sule summary does not mention the event actually referred to here, Emperor Wu inviting Sima Xiangru to the capital upon reading his "Rhapsody on Sir Vacuous."46 3.19.7. "Blue Darkness" Rather, "Azure Ethereality [of the Heavens]." 3.20.25. " 'The old horse thinks itself a colť " Owen mentions that this is a "phrase from 'Hornbow' in the Classic of Poetry' (p. 151 n. 1) but does not explain its meaning. The source text ( Shijing 223/5) is actually "The old horse perversely thinks itself a colt" i&amp;J&gt; but here Du Fu is using the image affirmatively and not ironically, implying "The old horse has properly become a colt," that is, been rejuvenated. 3.29.8. "facing the wind he sniffs three times the fragrance weeping" I llfìÙL: More grammatically, "facing the wind he sniffs three times, weeping in the wafting fragrance." 3.35.9. "Towers to the clouds seem moving, insubstantial" Rather, "Cloud-swept towers, so insubstantial, imperceptibly advance." 3.37.17. "Spring light wafts far and wide" Rather, "Spring light is clear and calm." Light does not waft. 3.41.5. "How can I rise to your mastery of expedient means?" This passage is nearly incomprehensible without reference to the passage in the Vimalakīrti sütra that employs all the key Buddhist terms (T 475: 14.545a). In particular, in this context upãya ( fangbian ^j{Ü) is better translated "salvific means" than "expedient means," since it is no mere expedient but an integral part of the struggle for liberation.47</page><page sequence="20">220 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 3.41.8. "I am pleased that my ignorance will be dispelled" Better, "I am pleased that my ignorance, once tolerated, will be dispelled," an allusion to the Changes , hexagram 4. 3.41.15. "Troubled, I know that these creatures are noisy" Better, "It pains me to say . . " 4.1.7. "A dragon nature, tough, and bold, it is sure to be transformed" Hft: Rather, "ready to mutate and transform." Note that propensity for bianhua is one of the basic properties of the dragon, as in Liu Wans (Jin dynasty) "Rhapsody on the Divine Dragon" (Shenlong fu í$HiÂ).48 4.6.100. "a chaotic swirl that cannot be grasped" rJ$5: Rather, "inconceiv- able chaos that cannot be grasped." Du Fu would have been capable of grasping a "swirl." 4.16.4. "summer s red light blazing" 7 Rather, "the vermilion fire of the sun blazing." "Red light" neither follows the Chinese nor makes sense in English. 4.16.31. "ten-yard kraken" Rather, "hundred-foot kraken." 4.17.15. "Leafless logs, rolling, torn up trees" Rather, "Leafless logs wrap around uprooted trees." 4.17.34. "and the shadowy vapors not be so black?" Rather, "and the foul air be no longer so dimmed and defiled?" 4.18.2. "she alone watches from her chamber" Rather, "she can only watch alone from her chamber." It is precisely the burden of the poem that Du Fu is also watching the moon, also alone. 4.18.3. "I am moved by my children far off there" Rather, "How I pity my small sons and daughters far off there." Cf. 3.35.53, where Owen does render ernii as "sons and daughters." 4.18.4. "who don't yet know to remember Changan" Rather, "who don't yet know how to remember Chang an," or "who dont yet comprehend remembrance of Chang an ." 4.34.12. "I especially feel that the dragons scales are moist" Here zui should be understood as "at that moment." 5.9.9-10. "With graying hair I scurry in the tent palace, / appointed, I attend on the phoenix-belled palanquin" For this reader, and, I believe, for many other readers of classical Chinese poetry, much of its pleasures lie precisely in the conceptual oppositions of couplets like this, with the duality of the aging Pan Yues (d. 300 c.e.) "dichromatic hair" opposed to the unity of a "sole mission" - lip , both elements of which are conspicuously absent from this translation. 5.11.20. "linked mountains darken beacon fires night and day" ^|JL[Hh Rather, "the mountain ranges are obscured by the smoke of beacon fires" (follow- ing von Zach, p. 102).</page><page sequence="21">Features 221 5.11.32. "Brown wild sheep, not gamey when feasted on, / ale with a straw, if much, one still gets drunk" If More grammatically, "There are brown wild sheep to feast on that are not gamey, / ale to drink with a straw that in volume will get you drunk." 5.12.2. "when I turn my head, all is a blur" ĚI1É*- *?£?£: Owens Du Fu, as if suffer- ing from nearsightedness, frequently sees the world as nothing but a blur rather than, for example, "an inconceivable vastness." 5.13.42.

Better, "I dont know even whether they're living or dead, / Let alone how far the journey to them." 6.41.8. "in thousands of sources of care, I stand alone" This arbitrary diminishing of "tens of thousands" ( wan ļ§§) is incorrect. "Thousands" would be an insufficient order of magnitude for the sources of anxiety in any persons life, let alone for Du Fu in 758. The rebel armies of An Lushan and Shi Siming numbered in the tens of thousands. Substitute, for example, "I stand alone facing disaster in its myriad guises." 6.45.10. "speak not of hardships and troubles, of times still drunk with battle" Since this poem is a "Song of Drunkenness" celebrating an evening of ale-drenched companionship, "drunk with battle" here is an unfortu- nate double entendre. Rather, "speak not of hardships and troubles, nor of fighting to the hilt." 6.50.7. "distress" fj|: Hen fS can mean "regret," "resentment," "hatred," "envy," or "malice," but never simply "distress." 6.55.42. "Hymn to the Yellow River Running Clear" The note here (79 n. 9) identifies this as an "auspicious omen of good government." Alterna- tively one might note that it is an actual composition by Bao Zhao (414- 466).49 7.4.1. "Hare-silk attached to dandelions or hemp" The long note appended here (89 n. 1) is difficult to follow since it neglects to mention that this is an adaptation of the fourth line of the eighth of the "Nineteen Old Poems" and is incomprehensible otherwise. 7.9.5. "to go off on my own" Duwang $§££ is actually an important Daoist concept developed by the xuanxue writers of the third and fourth centuries, meaning to roam independently of material attachments. 7.10.4.

"I looked all around, it was just a vast blur" IZSIIfB Since Du Fu goes on to describe the visual qualities of the scene it is not just a blur.

"Fame for a thousand, ten thousand years, / but what happens after death is a silence" This reading is self-contradictory; much more convincing is Hung's "A fame that is to last thousands of years / will rise after an unappreciated life is past" (Tu Fu. , p. 134). 7.18.16. "even more hated by the ways of this age" One cannot be hated by inanimate "ways" but rather by the "vulgar [people] of the age." 7.18/119 n. 2. "Ruan Ji and Xi Kang were famous high-minded recluses of the third century; both tried to stay out of political struggles, but both were executed": The fact that in an age of the utmost political danger, Ruan Ji behaved unconven- tionally and wrote opaque lyrics of personal desolation, but died a natural death, is one of the outstanding lessons of Chinese cultural history that has influenced its intellectuals up to the present day. 7.21.3-6. "When I look at the collection of poems he wrote, / he really hated his barren life. / How can sufficiency make a fulfilled life?-/ his silent understanding indeed did not come early" 0 This interpretation does not make sense in light of the allusions to the poetry of Tao Qian and Xie Lingyun. For line 4, substitute "He often begrudged his deprivation," a reading that is indisputable in light of Tao Yuanmings "Drink- ing Wine," #n.51 For line 5, substitute "For mastering the principles of life how is this sufficient?"

Du Fu is praising two men for their success in obtaining office, hardly the place for "pity" 8.19.44. "the fisherman hated the one who was singularly sober" It would be incompatible with the character of the fisherman to "hate" Qu Yuan. The correct verb here is "envied." 8.22/219 n. 5. " 'Concentrating ones thought' is a technical term in Daoist medita- tion.

"grow great and flourish for nothing" It is interesting to note that posuo occurs in Shishuo xinyu 1ÊÍÃÍÍÍp&gt; 28/8, also in relation to a tree, but with the opposite meaning: "The locust tree is declining; it no longer has the will to live" Thus in reference to trees, posuo may refer to the apex of growth, the point of ultimate flourishing from which it is possible only to fade and die. In this vein we might substitute "grow to utmost ripeness and lushness, but all in vain." 10.35.1. "Old, I'm forced to travel by being in a cage" 1 appreciate Owens following the lectio difficilior over "Growing old, Im shamed by the laughter of wife and children" But one is then forced to make sense of the given text, which is difficult.

"I never dare fail to wrap it up and carefully put it away" It seems curious that this poem in praise of a palm whisk should conclude by celebrating its removal, until one identifies the allusion to Zhuangzi: "If you intend to take safe precautions against the thieves who rifle trunks, grope in bags, break open cupboards, you must wind round with straps and cords [jianteng fasten with bolts and hasps- this is what conventional opinion calls wisdom."62 Then this line should be rendered "I never dare neglect to wind it round with straps and cords' [like the man in Zhuangzi who strived to protect his precious belongings from the great thief]." 12.71.8.

"in twilight years his poems and fu stirred the River Pass" iīM- As noted above, fu are poems, so this is redundant. Also, it seems very modest praise of Yu Xin to suggest his poetry only impressed a particular pass.

"for all time in the highest clouds one creature of feathers and down" Híf ļfff - &lt;0^¡: While Owen frequently cuts back the hyperbole of the text, some- times he exaggerates it further.

"Later worthies combined normative precedents, / each offered a clear model through successive ages" 0J ' "Each" seems to refer to either the worthies or the precedents, obscuring Du Fus clear implication that each of the successive ages offers a model, and "clear" is too neutral and blood- less for the laudatory qing tff , "pure and elevated." The couplet might better be rendered "Later worthies combined the precedents of old, / In successive ages variously offering pure and elevated models." 18.1. 27.

The emendation to shi yuan ïJM seems convincing, particular under Suzuki s interpretation that the line simply characterizes the devastation after years of war, with the earth so stripped of its vegetation that now "a rocky plain covers the whole realm" (4:170). 19.23.25. "The world s shallow ways are thousands, / but the recluse walks alone" Granting that we live in a shallower age, it seems to me that the first line is not hyperbolic and should be translated literally. "How many myriad aspects take the shallow and vulgar?" Also, Chinese recluses were often quite sociable, so the point is not that he is solitary but that he has integrity ("walked to his own singular pace"). 19.27.10. "a shaman is drunk among spider webs" Identifying wuxi MM as a single shaman makes this line more mysterious than it ought to be. Given the context of the poem, parallelism with "insects and snakes" in the previ- ous line, and the collective term (originally meaning "male and female shamans"), this should be read in the plural: "there shamans lie intoxicated amid spiderwebs." 19.29.3.

"Moving" is ambiguous and not strong enough for ai so this line might better be rendered "Your unblemished writings stir me like sorrowful jade." The second line, which goes unannotated, is an allusion to the famous story of the butcher from Zhuangzi /6 19-38.39- "There is a white tiger in the sky on the right" Better, "In the sky the White Tiger is on the right [i.e., to the west]." The White Tiger is one name for the western quadrant of Heaven. 19-38.47-48. "Human lives stir one another, / firm as metal and stone, a pair of glowing lights" Qingying is not just any pair of "glowing lights" but the gleam of precious gems: "both sharing the scintillating gleam of bronze and gems." 19.41.22.

"Yin Keng and He Xun, still clear and concise" "Clear and concise" seems a poor description of the style of either poet. Rather, "Like Yin and He you value the elegantly laconic." 19.41.84/201 n. 7. "In the Zhuangzi words are the fishtrap; when one gets the mean- ing, one forgets the fishtrap." A fisherman who forgot his trap as soon as he had gotten the meaning would obtain a poor catch. 19.41.132. "white planted, Lu pool lotuses" The lotus would turn white in blossom, not when they were "planted." But zhong ® can simply mean "grow" or "cultivate" as well. Thus, "white-blossomed grew the lotuses of the Lu family pond." 20.2.6. "talent and fame, more than Tutor Jia Yis" This reading is both syntactically and culturally objectionable. Better, "talent and fame as great as Tutor Jias." 20.31.4. "the fragrances do not miss their former times" Rather than this curious anthropomorphism, substitute "these wafting fragrances since olden times are not omitted." 20.31/251 n. 1.

"Stretching a bow depending on fading moonlight / was not only in the camp of the House of Han" : More comprehensibly, "Bows are stretched out by the fading moonlight, / Not only in the camp of the House of Han." Suzuki takes this to mean not only in the capital but also here (4:330), and von Zach to mean not only in the Chinese army but also in the army of the invaders (p. 430). 20.45.8. "For ten years a sojourner on rivers and lakes, / lost in a daze, heart in its twilight years" From context and also common sense we know that the "heart" cannot be "lost in a daze," but rather is ". . . wandering through endless space," or "lost in futility." 20.51.8. "in the northwest is a lone cloud" 271 n. 3. "An opening image in third-century poetry": This is imprecise. A nearly identical line opens one particular third-century poem, a "Miscellaneous Poem" by Cao Pi.78 20.61.1-2. "Rice grains, cooked, can become white, / autumn mallows, boiled, are also fresh" This seems unsatisfactory to me because the rice grains would already be white before cooking and the mallow just as fresh before boiling.

Perhaps better, "Rice grains grow even whiter after cooking; / Autumn mallow gains new flavor after blanching."</page><page sequence="34">234 China Review International: Vol. 21, Nos. 3 &amp; 4, 2014 20.63.5.

"At Mount Wu we no longer see our Huiyuan of Mount Lu, / chapel in a grove of pines, autumn winds late in the day" C jUflfè: The yuan jü in the first line implies Huiyuan but its surface meaning is the literal one: "Here at Mount Wu, [the Huiyuan of] Mount Lu does not seem far at all," because the living monk Dajue is equally excellent. In the second line, lanruo BBÍEf is a transliteration of Skt. ãranya , meaning forest, so there is a pun in this line as well, though an interlingual one that may not be intentional: "at your hermitage [literally, forest place of solitude] in this grove of pines, autumn winds blow late in the day." 20.102/333 (preface): "dance the 'Sword Dance and the Astrakhan'" "Astrakhan" is a type of fur named after a city in southern Russia. Huntuo is a type of felt hat, which, despite its foreign connotations, comes from a native Chi- nese word literally meaning "skinned whole." In this case huntuo means a dance performed while wearing this type of hat, perhaps the "Skinned Hat Dance"?80 20.104.15-16. "Why was there the knotted cord, / that we fell here, stuck in lacquer and glue?" 34i n. 1. "The supposed origin of writing": The knotted cord is the origin of writing, but specifically for governance: "In primitive times people knotted cords in order to govern."81 "Lacquer and glue," like the knotted cords, symbolize advances of civilization that take us farther away from perfect and naive simplicity. Thus "Yao lacked the contracts of lacquer and glue in his epoch, but the Way flourished" With these ideas from the Book of Changes and Han Feizi in mind, this couplet should be translated "For what purpose was first introduced the knotted cord [of governance], / And the further disaster of this lacquer and glue [for contracts and other social arrangements]?" 21.1.6. "Ziehen Palace" Not just any palace but the "Purple Sanctum [of the Pole Star]," corresponding to the palace where the emperors private quarters were located. 21.5.4. "in the thousands of events in human life, nothing does not happen" Aife : "Thousands" is the wrong order of magnitude. Estimating one event per day, by this time of Du Fus life he would already have experienced nearly twenty thousand. 21.5.18. "inconstancy in human life is seen as ugly" This line needs to be integrated into the human drama of this poem ("Worthy of Sighs" nJlfc), for example, "although that inconstancy in human affairs [on the part of Wang Jiyou], he [the governor] did deem ugly."</page><page sequence="35">Features 235 21.6.20. "I am touched by how loyalty and filiality, / both lovely things, will be painted in Unicorn Gallery" Edward H.

"Within a vast blur of nothingness" ÍMWkĚtMM- The sky is a vast and empty space, but not a blur. The primary meaning of momo yJliJI is simply silence, which adds an interesting new dimension to this vision of space: "Within that vast nothingness and imponderable stillness." 21.12.5. "Frantic, the goose that is able to cry out" According to the parable from Zhuangzi cited in the note, this is the goose that survives the hunter, so its cry should not be "frantic" but rather "shrill and piercing." 21.13.7. "Warlike virtues, the time of the Kaiyuan" Wude was the first reign name of the Tang (618-626). 21.16.4. "if their tall trees survive, one should use them for the flowers."

"dont envy the bag of purple gauze" Jïlt^)llïi; 379 n. 4. "As Xie Xuan was famous for wearing as a youth, hence being a frivolous young noble": This is one interpretation, but not that suggested by the original source in Shishuo xinyu, 27/14. There the key point is that Xie Xuans uncle disliked the bag and employed a ruse to destroy it. From this point of view we could also read the line as an evoca- tion of an elder's concern for a young mans development. 21.41.22. "Wolf Head: like treading the jowls" This is incomprehen- sible without the filli reference from Shijing 160/1: "The wolf may catch in its own dewlap / Or trip upon its tail. /But this nobleman, so tall and handsome, / In his red shoes stands sure."84 21.41.79. "The five-colored clouds are as high as Taijia" The note comments only that "Taijia is a star" (407 n. 4). Taijia is not just any star but one of the stars in the North Pole Asterism, thus at the very apex of the celestial sphere. 21.55.4. "the blue glow of the northeastern pinnacle was gloomy and diminutive" A "gloomy glow" is an oxymoron.

"Grand achievements are the commonplace form" This would be startlingly optimistic for Du Fu in 768. More likely, "Hegemonic author- ity is established by seeking out the universal forms." 21.68.60. "have mysterious hearts like dead ashes" There is noth- ing mysterious about dead ashes. Better, "have hearts as void of feeling as dead ashes." 21.69.21. "monsters" These cannot be identified precisely, of course, but since the Erya suggest they are feline, "sphynxes and chimeras" would be appropriate. 21.69.29/453 n. 11. "the Taijue was the asterism that stood for the palace": In addi- tion, the Great Horn (Dajue is an extremely bright star that appears first in the sky in spring and summer, so its return in this line is symbolically fitting for the restoration of order. 21.69.53. "flying glowworms" Though usage is various, "glowworm" typically refers to the wingless females or larvae of a species like Lampyris nocti- luca , which cannot fly. Since these are flying they seem more likely to belong to a species of fireflies as of the genus Lucióla , whose luminous females are fully winged. 22.6.15. "In dreary solitude, those who blow froth" Rather, "Like those in a desolate wasteland who blow froth on another for sustenance." The fish in the Zhuangzi parable are not in "solitude," since the primary point of the refer- ence here is mutual aid and reciprocity. 22.9.38. "you still bear aims that worry about the age" Rather, "you still bear aspirations out of anxiety for our age." 22.11.8. "it is like that moment when wind and cloud meet" Qi is not any random moment but the "appointed" or "destined moment." 22.17.12. "Ballad of the Russet Wisps" Though a note explains that this refers to the court, "russet wisps" does not clearly indicate its primary sense of one of the highest strata of the heavens, with Daoist implications: "the cinnabar- colored empyrean." 22.21. 6. "hard to call back the soul of the wayfarer in Chu" Accord- ing to the note identifying this as Qu Yuan, Chu ke must mean "the wayfarer from Chu," the "exile of Chu." 22.30.4. "Heaven and Earth float day and night" 0 More naturally, this line refers to the waters of Lake Dongting, "between Heaven and Earth flowing on day and night" (see Suzuki, 4:639).</page><page sequence="37">Features 237 22.49.4. "to ride a bamboo horse with rosy cheeks I have no means" ftllISttŤÍSc It is probably not the bamboo horse that has rosy cheeks.

"Gleaming pure, this reclusive, expansive heart, / earnestly solicitous, different from how Ive always been" 87 n. 4. "This apparently refers to Du Fu having to humble himself seeking patronage": The first line must be understood in light of the previous couplet on a fish and deer roam- ing far off without hope of return. The standard interpretation of the second line, followed by Owen, creates the implausible suggestion that Du Fu is saying he is not usually quanquan UMp, a term employed in the Doctrine of the Mean , chapter 8: "This was the manner of Hui: he made choice of the Mean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly, as if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it- ' »WJK ' • mmmmm in other words, it implies the earnest and uncompromising devotion of a Yan Hui. The couplet should then be translated: "Shining in its purity, my isolated heart in réclusion; / Earnestly endeavoring, but unlike my usual self." Though this interpre- tation is not conclusive, it at least makes logical sense of the couplet (cf. Suzuki, 4:694). The purpose of the reduplicative binômes is to convey general qualities rather than specific actions. 22.62.27. "Long I have been a Xie Lingyun, accustomed to seeking secluded places" 97 n. 8. "The landscape poet Xie Lingyun of the early fifth century": Actually this line identifies Xie Lingyun (385-433), not only of the fifth century but also of the fourth, as "sojourner Xie," referring to his childhood name ke'er given to him because he spent the first fifteen years of his life adopted into the family of Du Mingshi member of the Heavenly Masters sect of Daoism. Thus this line explicitly contrasts Du Fus Daoist pursuits with his Buddhist inclinations in the following line. 22.62.31/99 n. 1. "The poet Song Zhiwen of the early eighth century": Song Zhiwen 7^A¿fni (ca. 656-712) actually lived most of his life in the seventh century. 23.11.3-4. "A puff of cloud, Heaven shares such distance; / the long night, moon the same in solitude" ' ¿Kfáñ l"I5Ł: The couplet may be read in several ways, but "moon the same in solitude" does not correspond to any one of them. Better, for example, "A fleck of cloud is far from Heaven as I; / through the long night sharing the moons solitude." 23.14.5. "My purse is simply bare of coins" Rather, "My purse of gold-embossed [knife-coins] is simply bare." This refers to the famous coinage of Wang Mang. 23.21.7. "He sighed at my gloomy poem on seeking friends" It is improbable that Du Fu would either have written such a poem or described it in such a way.

According to the Mao commentary this poem is about a man ele- vated to high position who does not forget his old friends, so the line is appropri- ate either in regard to Du Fus relation with Gao or with the two other friends mentioned in the preface to this poem, all of whom were in high places, relative to Du Fu. 23.22.76. "but f 11 just be the crane that sings in the marsh" *75 n. 2. "The crane in the marsh/ from the Classic of Poetry, was a figure for the recluse": The Mao commentary to this poem {Shijing, 184) actually reads: "This says that though his person is in seclusion yet his fame is illustrious" 23.23.11-12. "All the death and destruction since ancient times can be known from this, / in the human world either sadness or pleasure soon drives the other away" Rather, "From all the death and destruction since ancient times we can know well / that in the human world both sorrow and joy are only brief and soon dispelled." 23.26.18. "the tangerine tree and well are still dreary" To the contrary, they are "still cool and refreshing." 23.38.6.

"Recently the commanding general was slain, / at midnight, wounded in battle" This couplet thus translated becomes an enigma: how is it possible to be wounded after being slain? An alternative is to take the subject of the second line as the white horse, who is after all the topic of the poem (Suzuki, 4:845). 23.40.46.

"Heng Mountain and the rivers and lakes are large, / with steaming pools, pestilence is unusually common" The subject of the first line must be the bodies of water specifically, while in the second line, Zheng M is the name of a river and not an adjective. Von Zach gets it right: "Strom und Seen in der Nachbarschaft des Heng-Riesenberges sind von weiter Ausdeh- nung (schwer zu bereisen), am Cheng-hsiang-Fluss kommt aussergewöhnlich viel Malaria vor" (p. 761). 23-49-7.

"Ge Hongs corpse surely was released" This actually means "Ge Hong surely was delivered by means of a [simulated] corpse."89 6:253.

Une infinité de gens de lettres, les esprits les plus péuétrans et les plus sublimes, ont pris à tâche pendant plusieurs années d'éclaircir l'antiquité. Cette tâche de messieurs les critiques, ayant pour objet les actions de quelques hommes, devait être plus facile que celle des philosophes, qui a pour objet les actions de Dieu: cependant les critiques ont donné tant de preuves de l'infirmité humaine, qu'on peut composer de gros volumes de leurs faussetés. Ces volumes peuvent donc mortifier Vhomme du côté de sa plus grande vanité , cest-à-dire du côté de la science. Ce sont autant de trophées ou autant darcs de triomphe érigés à l'ignorance et à la faiblesse humaine ."

Some later editors thus emended "fragrant plants" to "mushrooms and plants" 2l1pL, based on this allusion and the graphic similarity of the characters. This important variant is not mentioned in Owen's critical apparatus because it is not an early one. 41.
