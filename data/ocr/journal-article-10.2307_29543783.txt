<plain_text><page sequence="1">CENTRAL PARK CITY Lorna McNeur The grid as a rationalizing structure permeates every scale of human existence, from the lines on writing-paper to the organization of city blocks. While it may increase the level of efficiency of everyday life, it fails to address certain experiential needs which are also important. As architects concerned with environment we must recognize that the two are interdependent and delicately balanced. Richard Sennett describes the urban street grid as a design man? ipulation which evokes a sense of timelessness ? in the negative sense: 'Gridded space does no more than create a blank canvas for development. It subdues those who must live in the space, [by] disorienting their ability to see and to evaluate relationships. In that sense, the planning of neutral space is an act of dominating and subduing others.'1 The contemporary obsession with technology as the answer to all our needs has engendered patterns of living which are predomi? nantly diagrammatic. Similarly, urban planning has been reduced to the design of efficient circulation patterns, and public space has come to be regarded as a luxury. Architects help to reinforce such attitudes in their failure to create spaces where city dwellers can engage in replenishing activities. Joseph Rykwert has written that, 'Not only must the architect learn to make built scripture readable again, he must make movement the essential, even the controlling element of his plan. Not the interested movement of traffic, but the free and articulated movement of people to whom he offers a setting within which they may play the drama of their lives with dignity. '2 New York City and the Grid In the early seventeenth century, when Dutch traders settled on the southern tip of Manhattan, it was an island which was sacred to the Indians as a site for their harvest ceremonies. The settlement prospered and gradually began to grow northward. By the early part of the nineteenth century the city's politicians had recognized its potential as an international centre of trade and commerce, and they realized that, instead of just letting it wander up the island until it reached the northern tip, an overall plan would be needed. Although there was some talk of an architectural competition, it was decided instead to superimpose a grid on the island. This was carried out between 1811 and 1850. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park (1850-75), disdainfully recounts an anecdote explaining the decision to create a grid. The story goes that one day the city politicians were standing around a map of Manhattan island that was lying on the ground. AA FILES 23 There happened to be a gridded mason's tool on top of it, and somebody exclaimed, 'Can you think of anything finer?'3 Olmsted, who deplored the idea of the grid, explains the necessity of establishing a park within it: 'It should present an aspect of spaciousness and tranquillity with variety and intricacy of arrange? ment, thereby affording the most agreeable contrast to the confine? ment, bustle, and monotonous street-division of the city.'3 New York City and Central Park A park within a city is not unusual. But a city within a park is a phenomenon that is rarely acknowledged. The re-creation or imitation of paradise has often been an urban project: the garden would not only be created within the city, but would reflect the city.4 Thus the plan of a city with its radiating avenues is embodied in the garden of Versailles, a reflection, idealized in form, of a city made for the king of France. The garden not only reflected the city but might encapsulate some of the paradoxes and apparent oppositions of conventional thinking about culture and nature. In the sixteenth-century Villa Lante in Rome a wilderness garden epitomizes the purity of the Golden Age, while the geometrically arranged formal garden symbolizes civilization, which is synonymous with the city. In a more subtle way the embodiment of politics ? the business of city and court ? can be found in the gardens of Stowe in Buckinghamshire. Whig politicians retired there to seek not only refuge from active political affairs, but refreshment in an idyllic setting where their political ideals found poetic expression in the various temples and pavilions. Thus the juxtaposition of garden and city is revealed as essential to the qualities of each. Paradise can be perceived as the Heavenly City and/or the Garden of Eden. An aerial photograph of the city of New York shows an island gridded with streets, within which is reserved the rectangular site of Central Park. Embedded within the park itself are what appear to be the ruins of a lost city, traced by the roads, the Promenade, the Mall, Bethesda Fountain, the Bowling Green, the Boat Pond. Analysis of this 'lost city' has revealed that at both a formal and a philosophical level it represents the plan of Manhattan. Olmsted frequently referred to the Park and the City simultane? ously, implying that the two might be seen as interchangeable.5 The unprecedented shape of Central Park (its proportions are 1:5, the same as those of the island in which it sits) was an inevitable consequence of the shape of Manhattan and of its existing street grid. In preparing his designs for the park Olmsted decided to study 65</page><page sequence="2">plans of cities rather than other parks, for, as he wrote, the form and position of Central Park are peculiar . . . and such that precedent with dealing with it is rather to be sought in the long and narrow boulevards of some of the old continental European cities, than in the broad parks with which, from its area in acres, we are most naturally led to compare it.6 He began by setting down the major road system, organizing it in a configuration similar to that of New York City.7 The main drive forms a continuous loop through the park, describing an island that is curiously similar in shape to Manhattan. The north-south orient? ation of the main drive parallels the avenues of the city and follows the perimeter of the park in a distorted fashion. This drive and the borders of the park describe a compressed core-and-periphery relationship similar to that between Manhattan and the closely bor? dering shores opposite. The transverse roads cut through the park in the same way that the major crosstown streets of Manhattan cut across the island, paralleling each other in orientation and serving the same purpose of forming a direct connection between the East Side and the West Side. Olmsted compares these transverses to the then major crosstown streets of the City: 'Each of these will be the sole line of communi? cation between one side of town and the other, for a distance equal to that between Chambers street and Canal street.'8 He also men? tions Broadway: 'If we suppose but one crossing of Broadway to be possible in this interval, we shall realize that these transverse roads are destined to become . . . crowded thoroughfares.'9 In order to avoid creating a series of undesirable intersections between the Grand Promenade and the transerve roads, as exist between Broad? way and the crosstown streets, Olmsted lowered the latter to a depth of about twelve feet below the surface of the ground. These, because they connect with the city grid, appear to be a continuation of it, yet in reality the primary road system of Central Park is essen? tially a warped grid composed of the main drive and the transverses. By using a device reminiscent of the English ha-ha Olmsted was able to create the illusion of a continuous landscape, while simul? taneously subdividing it. The gridded road structure divides the park into sections and each is conceived as a different type of landscape.10 These can be seen as neighbourhoods within the Park, just as the major crosstown streets and avenues of the City define its different neighbourhoods. The Grand Promenade is the secondary system, paralleling Broadway in its diagonal orientation to the grid of Manhattan. The positioning of both was determined by topographical conditions. Broadway was originally an Indian trail heading due north along the contours of Manhattan. The site and orientation of the Grand Promenade were determined by Olmsted when he stood one day in the southeast corner of the Park, at the intersection of the main drive and one of the transverses, and observed that 'Vista Rock, the most prominent point in the landscape of the Lower Park, here first comes distinctly into view, and fortunately in a direction diagonal to the boundary lines'.11 Along the axis of this Grand Promenade Olmsted placed the elements of an English country house and its park, making adjust? ments in scale between a mansion and garden for a family, to that of a mansion and garden for the 'family' of the City:12 In giving [the Grand Promenade] this prominent position, we look at it in the light of an artificial structure on the scale of magnitude commensurate with the size of the park, and intend in our design that it should occupy the same position of relative importance in the general arrangement of the plan that a mansion should occupy in a park prepared for private occupation.13 Olmsted's political ideals were embodied in this arrangment. An ardent democrat, he hoped to instil among the citizens of New York 66 a sense of ownership of and personal attachment to Central Park. The Grand Promenade represents the grand entrance to the stately home, which would stand in the large open space of the Mall. The 72nd Street transverse, including the terrace where Sunday strollers parade, is the carriage entrance.14 The terrace overlooks Bethesda Fountain and the romantic landscape of the lake and the rambles beyond. The axis of the Grand Promenade con? tinues, perceptually, through the landscape, to the view of the Belvedere Castle at Vista Point, which was built at a tiny scale in order to appear even more distant. To the east of the Mall is the arbour, and farther along is the flower garden (this has since been transformed into a miniature boat pond). To the west, in its proper position in relation to the house, is the bowling green.15 Numerous places were planned along the Grand Promenade where New Yorkers could engage in the custom of promenading. This represents another parallel with the role of Broadway vis-?-vis the City, for Broadway, as the centre of the theatre distict, was the fashionable avenue for shopping and promenading ? the true Grand Promenade of New York City.16 As the city moved northward, so did the theatre district, re-establishing itself along Broadway, which in 1854 was described by Putman's Monthly as 'not only the main artery of the city . . . [but also] the agglomeration of trade and fashion, business and amusement, public and private abodes, churches and theatres, barrooms and exhibitions, all collected into one promiscuous channel of activity and dissipation'.17 The City within the Park For ?lmsted the need for Central Park was a direct result of its con? text: within the 'densely populated central portion of an immense metropolis', it provides 'a means to certain kinds of REFRESH? MENT OF THE MIND AND NERVES which most city dwellers greatly need'.18 As an urban park it must respond in ?s complex a way as does the city to the needs of its inhabitants. In relation to the size and density of New York it is a vast area, yet in relation to the large variety of landscapes contained therein it is small: 'the com? paratively small area . . . has been given a sense of boundlessness by being turned in upon itself to become a complex macrocosm of nature'.19 These varying landscapes can be seen as 'neighbour? hoods' designed to suit the varying needs of the population: indeed the park could be described as a city clothed in foliage. The device of the mansion reinforces this idea, for in relation to the microcosm of the landscapes within which it sits its elements are enormous, implying a scale commensurate with that of a lost city. If the plan of New York City is superimposed on the plan of Cen? tral Park, the parallels I have described above become clear. Vista Point and Columbus Circle are datum points, and the Grand Promenade and Broadway (and the Bowery) are datum lines. The distance between Columbus Circle and Union Square is the same proportionally as the distance between Belvedere Castle and the Mall of the Grand Promenade. This is significant, because Union Square and the Bowery were important parts of the City when the Park was designed, and the Mall and Union Square both serve as public gathering-places. The axis of the Grand Promenade culmin? ates in Belvedere Castle, just as Columbus Circle creates a signifi? cant pause in Broadway at 59th Street (where Central Park begins). The location of the rectangular reservoir (now filled in) within Central Park is analogous to the location of Central Park within Manhattan. Columbus Circle sits at the southwest corner of the park, just as Belvedere Castle sits at the southwest corner of the old rectangular reservoir. Thus the presence of the city within the park begins to emerge. Is this the plan of a European city that Olmsted envisioned for Manhattan, in his contempt for the grid which covered a once beautiful island: the Paradise Lost of New York?

All of the open spaces in the park are raised and become built forms, while the paths and roads, occasionally widening into piazzas, remain at ground level. At the periphery of the core of the park the land drops away, exposing it as an island, with the edge and the towers which stand outside it suggesting the walls of a medieval city. The labyrinthine paths also have a medieval quality, while the overlaid axis of the Grand Promenade recalls ancient Rome, or its revival in the Renaissance. Placed within the old, rectangular-shaped reservoir of Central Park, this reconstructed city completes the sequence, creating an infinite regress: The natural island was sacred to the Indians. It was subsequently gridded. Within this grid was retained a rectangular AA FILES 23 site, Central Park, in order to preserve a small portion of the 'natural' landscape. Within Central P?rk there was a rectangular reservoir, into which could be inserted the reconstructed 'lost city'. Within this lost city is the rectangular shape of Central Park, into which can be inserted the natural and sacred island of Manhattan. The inwardly spiralling theme of garden-city-garden is finally resolved when the original island is reinstated within the reservoir. The twentieth-century mind submerged within the three dimensional grid of the buildings surrounding and overlooking the park observes, with melancholy, the cityscape and landscape of its imagined history and idealized plan. The Manhattan Model To explore the implications of superimposing the Grand Promenade plan onto Broadway, a model of Manhattan was built ? a three 67</page><page sequence="4">^1 ^ It ?^^^^^^H ^^^^^^^^^^^^ , jjji^ 77*e Manhattan Model 68 dimensional version of the drawing that juxtaposes Central Park and Manhattan. This model revealed qualities which might other? wise have remained invisible. The grey undulations of the buildings resemble the contours of a natural landscape, reminding us of what the island might have looked like before the road grid was built. Thereafter, each plot of land retained its natural features until it was bought and levelled to make way for a building. There is also an interesting correspondence between the landscape and the city scape, because the composition of the substratum determines the maximum height of building which can be supported by it. This is not an entirely abstract notion. Standing on top of the World Trade Center at dusk or dawn, with squinted eyes it is pos? sible to see the city scape as a more or less continuous mass, an abstract landscape. Similarly, a view from across the river gives the impression of a cohesive form, a self-contained city. With a river separating it from the adjacent land, Manhattan appears to be a castle surrounded by a moat. Often the nucleus of the medieval city was a castle, and therefore the castle can also be seen as a microcosm of the city ? an ideal city. Similarly, New York, an inwardly turning city, can be seen as a fortified city, and Central Park, with the tall buildings surrounding it, as a walled medieval garden. In referring to the island of Manhattan it has become impossible not to refer simultaneously to the island in the Park. These can perhaps be seen as the earthly city and the heavenly city, respectively, analogous to hell and heaven. Thus Central Park can also be described as a sacred space, analogous to a church, which can be seen as an earthly embodiment of the heavenly city.20 During the day, Central Park represents an oasis in the midst of a city which is driven by the struggle for survival. At night it becomes a hell. Umberto Eco compares Manhattan and Central Park to a medieval town surrounded by woods in which 'a wanderer ... at night saw them peopled with maleficent presences; one did not lightly venture beyond the town; men went armed. This con? dition is close to that of the white middle-class inhabitant of New York, who doesn't set foot in Central Park after five in the after? noon. '21 Both sacred space and infernal space, Central Park has as many facets as the city it mirrors. The five-foot-long architectural model of Manhattan cuts a haunt ingly anthropomorphic figure, with a womb at its centre ? the replenishing space of Central Park, symbolizing the sacred spaces in which life is nurtured and springs forth. Is this gridded island the caged corpse of a landscape betrayed? Is New York haunted by the death of the spirit of this island? Do New Yorkers inhabit a violated landscape ? the garden of earthly delights? Urban Design in Manhattan In theory the decision to place Central Park in the centre of the island as a relief from the grid seemed a good one; in practice it is frequented mostly by the people who live within a few blocks of it. Richard Sennett writes: Whenever Americans of the era of high capitalism thought of an alternative to the grid, they thought of bucolic relief, such as a leafy park or a promenade, rather than a more arousing street, square, or center in which to experience the complex life of the city. The nineteenth-century con? struction of Central Park in New York is perhaps the most bitter example of this alternative, an artfully designed natural void planned for the city's center in expectation that the cultivated, charming territory already established around it ? as bucolic and refreshing a scene as any city dweller could wish for within a few minutes drive from his house ? would be razed to the ground by the encroachments of the grid.22 Can the discovery of the plan of New York embedded within Central Park inform the design of the city in a real and tangible way? The model of Manhattan represents a visionary approach to AA FILES 23</page><page sequence="5">^^I^QV'v Gl ^P8t P/an of Manhattan showing the five 'squares' along Broadway. Painting by Lorna McNeur and Kimberly Ackert, 1986. this question. A more realistic approach might be to reinstate Broadway as the Grand Promenade of New York City. Five triangular plots of land are created by the intersections between Broadway, the avenues and the major crosstown streets. With rare exceptions such as the Flatiron Building at Madison Square, they have not been regarded as desirable sites on which to build, and have therefore been allowed to fall into disrepair, becoming a haven for the homeless. During the past twelve years these 'squares' have been the subject of design investigations carried out by myself and interested col? leagues and students. A selection of these projects is illustrated on the following pages. In addition to exploring the potential of such spaces to enliven journeys through the City, they reflect the convic? tion that an awareness of the historical inhabitation of each place is essential to the creation of an appropriate design. As Richard Sennett has written, 'rather than copying the forms of the past, we need to understand the principles of their inventiveness.'23 Notes 1.

The metaphorical relationships between the house, the city and the garden are discussed by Plato, Vitruvius, and Alberti, among others. Plato draws an analogy between the city and the house: Tf men are to have a city wall at all, the private houses should be constructed right from the foundation so that the whole city forms in effect a single wall: ... a whole city looking like a single house will be quite a pretty sight.' (The Laws, VI, 779, translated by Trevor J. Saunders (Harmondsworth, 1970), p. 260.) Alberti's conception of the city as a great house, and of the villa as a miniature city, may have been influenced by this analogy. He not only draws an analogy between the city and the house, but extends it to include outdoor spaces which are extensions of the interior organ? ization of the house: 'for if a City, according to the Opinion of Philosophers, be no more than a great House and, on the other Hand, a House be a little City; why may it not be said, that the Members of that House are so many little Houses; such as the Court-yard, the Hall, the Parlour, the Portico, and the like?'.

The 72nd Street transverse is the only one that was not lowered, in order to allow it to engage with the 'mansion' design, as a carriage entrance. 15. A description of a seventeenth-century English country house in Ralph Dutton's The English Garden (London, 1937) corresponds quite closely with Olmsted's conception: 'In these shady paths, arbors would be formed contain? ing wooden seats, since the pleasure of walking and resting in the garden was fully appreciated at this period. To one side of the mansion would be the bowl? ing green, the turf kept as smooth and close as the roller and scythe could make it, while out of the immediate site of the main windows of the house, beyond the alleys, would be the kitchen garden, propably surrounded by a wall.' 16.

I had no idea what form it would take, but I was intrigued by the inherent contradiction of the theme: how could it be possible to design a home for a person who wanders? My work on Central Park had taught me that one definition of a garden is a home for the imagination to wander. When I discovered the presence of the city in Central Park, it became quite clear where this home should be: within the void in the Park which represents a mansion, the Mall. However, I found the idea of building within a sacred space such as Central Park distasteful, so I turned to its analogue on Broadway (New York's Grand Promenade), which is Union Square. There I designed a garden intended as a home for the wanderer. The site is a rectangular space with two crosstown streets meeting at its edges, therefore its situation can also be seen as similar to that of Central Park. Broadway passes through the site underground, as a subway. To acknowledge this the earth is peeled away and exposed as an abandoned train station in which to wander. The ordered nature of this part of the garden is analogous with what Olmsted called the iower formal' end of Central Park, including the Grand Promenade and the elements of an English mansion. At the northern end of the Union Square design there is a water reservoir contained in a basin blasted out of the granite base of Manhattan. This parallels the rugged 'upper natural' northern end of Central Park. A microcosm of Central Park, this Union Square design offers a multiplicity of layers for the New Yorker to appreciate peacefully, as a complement to the rugged life of the urban jungle. 70 ii \ \ AA FILES 23</page><page sequence="7">COMEDY AND TRAGEDY Madison Square (23rd Street &amp; Broadway) Stanley E. Kiernicki, thesis student, School of Architecture, Carleton University, 1988 Madison Square has always been a gathering place. During the last century numerous entertainment establishments such as the Hippodrome, the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus and Madison Square Garden flanked Madison Square Park, which was used for parades. At the turn of the century it was a place where the social elite met in cafes, bars and private clubs. Today, all that remains of that former vitality are two traffic islands, an endless stream of vehicles, and the occasional parade gathering on the side streets of the Park. Here Madison Square is perceived as a AA FILES 23 theatre of the city, with the existing park as the space for the audience, the building facades as the proscenium, and the stage as the square. The actors emerge from the central street, which divides the buildings and creates an urban perspective, similar to that which is found as a backdrop in Renaissance theatres and public spaces. The idea of the circus is used to establish a framework which would restore a sense of purpose to the space. Building would take place on the existing two traffic islands and on a strip of Madison Square Park. The south island becomes the Circus Cafe and Bar, the north island the 'Flying Club', a clubhouse and practice space for trapeze artists. The two face each other and are connected by a highwire. Together they act as a proscenium facing a landscaped amphitheatre in Madison Square Park. The overall composition forms a space that could be closed off to traffic periodically, for outdoor theatre or parade gatherings. The opposing parts represent the two clown types depicted in Fellini's film / Clowns. The Cafe takes the part of the White Clown ? elegant, dignified, and more or less in charge, a symbol of authority both religious and secular. His foil, the Auguste, with his baggy pants and oversized shoes is clumsy but invariably good-natured. The White Clown demands perfection, but his irritating self righteousness provokes the Auguste to rebel. At this scale the circus reinforms the space, with the two clowns as the main characters, or primary elements; on a broader scale it reflects the bittersweet realities of life in New York. 71</page><page sequence="8">FAITH AND COMMERCE Herald Square and Greeley Square (34th Street &amp; Broadway) Alex Leung, thesis student, School of Architecture, Carleton University, 1988 Herald Square and Greeley Square were once the forum of the newspaper industry, serving as a battleground between newspaper magnates James Gordon Benett and Horace Greeley and their empires; now they are a wasteland, victims of the traffic grid, and their proximity to Macy's department store is probably the only reason they have survived at all. A space in the city cannot be conceived of as an idealized space for idealized activities. Just as important to the formal organization of the space is its ability to adapt to the needs of contemporary life, whether ritualistic or sensational. It must be able to respond to rapidly changing fashions and social behaviour, perhaps be as transient as its occupants. The juxtaposition of the two squares sets up an actor-audience relationship, the theatricality of which is equally essential to both the experience and the architecture. The steps in Herald Square provide seating for planned or spontaneous events. A contemporary version of the Spanish Steps in Rome, they acknowledge the variety and universality of human interaction, ranging from the everyday needs of the worker to those of the transient shopper. At various stages along the steps there are boutiques and food stalls. A * speakers' corner' reflects the history of the square. The headquarters of an existing bank corporation ? a symbol of capitalistic New York ? serves as a backdrop to the steps. In Greeley Square there is a chaotic steel structure which is a water garden composed of elements that are typical of New York ? a fire escape, a balcony, a cat-walk, demolition rubble, etc. This celebrates the ageing of the city's 'body', a phenomenon that is unwelcome in a technologically oriented society. The staircase and platform lead nowhere, denying any pragmatic function yet remaining inhabitable. The water fountains and hanging vines are conceived of as a folly, a place for memory and contemplation. In this square ? a stage for ritual and ceremony ? are a video screen and, as a backdrop, the ruins of a church. The latter, which also acts as a shelter for the homeless, was salvaged from a commercial development. Stripped of all objects with a religious association, it stands as an artefact, its carcass a monument to a time when church buildings were more like anchors, both physically and spiritually. Now commercialism is the generator and master of public space, and thus the combination of church and video screen remind us of the absurdity and perversity of our way of life. 72 ?-?'^^^^^^K^^if3^^^J:r--f??

On the triangular plots at each end of the hourglass-shaped site are two buildings which face each other, engaging, as actor and audience, in a 'dialogue'. These are, respectively, the Tower of Time (left) and the Watchtower (right). Times Square, as the centre of the theatre district, is a place in which to watch and to be seen. The Tower of Time, a monument embodying the history of New York, is the protagonist. The occupants of the Watchtower, visitors to the city, are the audience, witnessing the drama of its past, present and future. The Square of Time The Theatre of Time The Tower of Time ?

Analytical Drawing Lorna McNeur with Rebecca Uss, student at Cooper Union School of Architecture, 1986 Columbus Circle has become a glorified traffic circle. These drawings portray it as a microcosm of contemporary society, which neglects and abuses the plant and animal life on which we rely for sustenance, both physical and spiritual. New York can be seen as the embodiment of such attitudes, and the site of Columbus Circle as a physical manifestation of the notion of cosmos and of the 'new world' that was discovered by Christopher Columbus.

Anne Lorenz, thesis student, School of m Architecture, Carleton University, 1986 m This design explores the relationship of M Columbus Circle to Central Park, revealing the S paradoxical role of public space in New York, ft and the lack of a vertical connection between je the underground and the ground above. At S present frenzied traffic fragments the Circle m and denies its existence. Yet this same h condition could be used to revitalize it by creating a column or spiral that would channel the movement upwards. Such an image recalls representations of the Tower of Babel, especially Breugel's famous painting. According to the legend, the inhabitants of the world tried to build a tower 'with its top reaching heaven. Let us make a name for ourselves, so that we may not be scattered about the whole earth.' God responded by making them all speak different languages, creating a condition which is hauntingly similar to the experience of life in New York, with its emphasis on survival, its self-centredness, and its myriad of languages. In the Bible the tower is condemned as an expression of pride. A more contemporary interpretation might be that it represents a hand reaching out for help. In the design this paradox is manifested by a building carved out of rock, which occupies the core of the circle (representing stability and knowledge), and a chaotic, peripheral condition which is being buried as a result of its own actions (representing a synthetic force). At the centre is a rare books library that contains a room devoted to each of the Seven Deadly Sins: m Pride, Covetousness, Gluttony, Lust, Envy, I Anger and Sloth. The book repository, a I continuous, labyrinthine space, reflects the I intertwined and overlapping character of I these sins. ' The project is composed of three elements: the centre is a garden, the periphery a passage for vehicles, and the gate the entrance to Central Park. The public space of the central garden is conceived as an extension of the Park, resting on top of a granite mountain carved out of the very matter of Manhattan itself. This is a restorative place. A path spiralling from the subway leads pedestrians through first the labyrinth of reading rooms and then the garden. The noise of the traffic spinning beneath is always audible in the background, as a reminder of the dangers of placing too much faith in technology. F 74 AA FILES 23</page></plain_text>
