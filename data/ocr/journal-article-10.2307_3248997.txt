Important earlier conflicts of interpretation are often cited in the footnotes; and the "appendix on translating" is a frank exposition of the reasons behind the author's most difficult decisions. Institute of Fine Arts Alexander Soper and their immediate heirs under the Han. The Sung Neo-Confucian movement receives the next degree of emphasis, followed by the epigoni of Ming, Ch'ing, and the Republic, and then by Chinese Buddhism. The ratio of page allotments is roughly 4: 2.2: 1.7: 1.2. A minor new feature is a discussion of the status of philosophy under Communism, in which Fung him- self plays a leading role. The book ends with: an "appendix on translating certain Chinese philosophi- cal terms": a double bibliography, first of suggested further readings and then of Western-language works cited in the text, both of these being largely confined to material in English; a glossary of Chinese charac- ters for names and technical terms (none appear elsewhere); and a reasonably comprehensive index. The book proper is almost entirely made up of trans- lations, all by the author. The necessary explanatory introductions have been kept as brief as possible, and personal comments, though fairly frequent, are still shorter. Professor Chan's method of presentation thus emphasizes the integrity of the original source, where Fung had constantly edited and re-arranged, so as to isolate leading ideas. Four basic works of modest dimensions are translated entire, the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, the Lao-ttu, and Chou Tun-i's Neo-Confucian essay on "Penetrating the Book of Changes." Elsewhere the larger works are introduced through one or more complete chapters, supple- mented often by "additional selections." The result is at least in appearance closer to the workings of the minds involved than Fung's mosaics. Modern Platonists with a tangential interest in the Far East may be able to visualize an archetypal History of Chinese Philosophy, existing perfect and unalloyed in the mind of the Creator. Professor Chan's book will probably seem to specialists from the various areas in which he has worked as little like this ideal as its rivals. It will doubtless be claimed that the processes of emphasis and suppression involved in his scheme of translation have ended by misrepresenting this concept or that. He will be shown to have chosen the wrong edition of an imperfectly preserved source; the least likely solution to a controversial passage; an impossible English equivalent for a key technical term. (For example, he renders throughout the fa- miliar ch'i of Hsie Ho's first precept as "material force". Bodde's choice for early uses of the term is "vital force", and for Neo-Confucian terminology, "ether.") For readers below this level of critical touchiness the book is likely to prove extremely Nelson I.

Like a faithful disciple of his own Tung Ch'i-ch'ang, Professor Wu has read io,ooo books and travelled I10o,ooo00 i, drawing on his Heaven-sent endowments all the while to look, feel, and ponder. Out of this background, rather than any interest in measuring, classifying, or dating, comes his engaging and in- tensely personal little book. The second page quite properly disavows the implications of its pre-imposed series title; it is indeed "a short interpretative essay." One may imagine it still more accurately described by another slogan drawn from art history; it might well be sub-titled a Corner of Creation Seen through a Temperament. Anyone who has made a comparable attempt will realize that it can have been by no means easy to com- pose a balanced and truthful account of two great architectural systems in some 40 octavo pages. Pro- fessor Wu's choice has been to minimize or omit con- ventional elements at the expense of others which seemed more meaningful. No dating problems are discussed, and no stylistic sequences are constructed. Only one monument, Barabudur, is described in a more than fragmentary fashion. History is reduced to a vestigial level. What one finds instead are recon- structions of early cosmological beliefs, glimpses of the Perennial Philosophy, and above all attempts to suggest the parts played by the two traditions in satis- fying the emotional needs of their makers and users. To the present reviewer this last aspect seems much more justifiably emphasized in the Chinese section than in the Indian, as the author's personal history should make natural. The central role of the Chinese house or palace is discussed with learning and an un- forced sympathy. Both historical fact and personal predilection, again, make it natural to emphasize the instinctive Chinese reaction against the formality of family and social life - and architecture - by the 362</page><page sequence="2">creation of the garden. Through the Indian world Professor Wu has passed as a relatively short-term visitor; and through again natural, it is less satis- factory that his strongest reactions should be sub- sumed under the heading of excitement. Not only the mediaeval temples but even the early Buddhist monuments, the presumed foci of stillness and peace, are described in terms of vivid kinaesthetic animation. Where the human factor in China can be described as the master of the household "sitting in his hall and facing his courtyard to the south," the author's pat- tern requires for India not a monk or priest, but a pilgrim: a first-time pilgrim, "not knowing exactly where the cave would be found but already excited by the proximity of it." This totally innocent eye must be drawn into the chaitya cave not by the nave, but through the narrow, dark, left-hand aisle, so that its first glimpse of the rock-cut stupa at the rear, be- tween the aisle columns, will come with the maximum degree of surprise, making "the focus of worship almost too powerful to behold." At Barabudur the experience will be so much more complex and pro- longed that when the pilgrim reaches the upper ter- races, and the gratification of arrival is suddenly countered by a confusing loss of direction, "at this darkest moment just before the enlightenment, we can almost hear a desperate cry of bewilderment, some- thing similar to 'Father, father, why hast Thou for- saken me?"' In no other architectural tradition, except the ancient Egyptian, is it so readily permissible to minimize the element of historical change as in the Chinese. In view of the confining dimensions of Wu's book and the demands of his prior interests, the few hints that he gives of the passage of time, and his single paragraph on the development of bracketing, are perhaps all that need be expected. In Indian architecture, on the other hand, the precise opposite is true. From the time of Asoka until the paralysis that set in under the shock of the Moslem invasions, monumental Indian build- ing demonstrated to the highest possible degree a predominance of Becoming over Being. To demon- strate this unending pressure to grow, push out, sub- divide, wither, and grow again the author has pro- vided a comparison of size between the tiny early Muktesvara temple at Bhuvaneswar and its gigantic successor the Lingaraja; a reference to the new ap- pearance of the sikhara tower over the temple sanctu- ary in the Guptan period; and a four-line sentence summing up the subsequent history of the temple form. Time here is not an incessant series of changes in the profiles and numbers of mouldings, cornices, niches, turrets, and breaks in plan but "an eternal shaft" with "an anthropomorphic god travelling up and down" it. Time in the Chinese sense, again, is not a slower, subtler waxing and waning of structural and aesthetic powers but the central shaft of a cubical cosmos. Down it the "universe spins, Chinese history unreels, the four seasons revolving with the Chinese cyclical calendar. There are good years and bad years, but the nation is forever the Central Kingdom." It would be bigoted to an absurd degree to criticize the author for failing to follow the conventional pat- terns of architectural analysis, exemplified let us say by Rowland and Soper. The contrast between cos- mological symbolism and the construction of a Sung temple hall's roof is too extreme to be judged by any criteria beyond personal preference. But surely there is always some way nearer to the middle; and here might it not have been possible and useful for the vast majority of readers, to carry out a series of re- latively minor exchanges? Substituting - to use the terminology of the cosmic myth of Izanami and Iza- nagi - that which is extra in the one for that which is lacking in the other? What is lacking, beyond a more generous recognition of the effects of time, is a few more prosaic facts. Chinese architecture, for example, is an exercise in relationships not merely between forms and spaces, but also between colors. The Chinese garden may well be "but a flickering of the changing scene", but it also is made up primarily of oddly shaped rocks. One of the symptoms of strength and confidence in the Chinese building craft at the height of its powers was an infatuation with great height. The Northern Sung capital was a city of pleasure towers, a .peaceful and hedonistic San Gi- mignano; and the horizontality that presses down over Peking is the first visible symptom of that beauti- ful city's decadence. Monumental Indian architecture, to go on, is a translation into stone of building forms developed in bamboo, thatch, and timber. A factor of increasing importance in the exterior appearance of a temple building is its sculpture. For statements of this sort, which for one reason or another have not been made, it should have been possible to trade at least the more extreme examples of the book's imaginative extravagance. Some of these verbal crockets have already been noticed in this review; one more ex- ample will demonstrate the situation. Here is a de- scription of the pilgrim who has completed his de- 363</page><page sequence="3">Japan"), she was fortunate in contacting Professor No- mura on a later visit to Japan. It was he who arranged and contributed to the New York exhibition, and Mrs. Minnich found in him the perfect collaborator, since his expertise and taste combined with her en- thusiasm and writing ability to make this present volume possible. As in the study of other Japanese arts one is again reminded of the miraculous survival of the Shoso-in repository of treasures which provide a record of eighth-century textiles wonderfully comprehensive in its scope. Sorting continues but there were to date 66,8 12 fragments large and small, already catalogued, and these include work inherited from earlier periods. The story of costume is told fully and with refreshing anecdote. There is technical detail for the student and an interest that never flags for the more general reader. The choice of illustrations is a particularly happy one as it presents a rich selection of fabrics and kimonos on the one hand and a chronology of reproductions of wood-block prints and paintings which through the ages have illustrated so dramatically and so beauti- fully the silk fabrics for which Japan is famous. A kimono draped on a stand is admirable and there is opportunity in a museum exhibition to establish just how great the achievement in design has been. But the true elegance of the kimono as displayed by the graceful, perhaps exaggeratedly sinuous forms of the Japanese actor or courtesan is certainly the most persuasive evidence to us of the great beauty and skill used in its creation. The artists varied their mood just as the characters changed their robes, and it is perhaps scarcely a true generalisation to write "Utamaro's exquisitely chisel- led beauties, whether of the demimonde or the worka- day world, appear clothed with refined restraint, both in design and colour" - though it is true the author makes her point with a quite sober print. "Even as the prints of Harunobu", she continues, "exhibit a grace and delicacy of colour compatible with the capricious rococo of Boucher and Fragonard, so the cold per- fection of Utamaro would have been very congenial to the classicism of David and the Napoleonic Em- pire". But one may find, on the one hand, prints of Utamaro where kimonos display the heights of glorious colour patterning, as for example in the series Seiro Juni Toki TsuZuki "The twelve hours of the Green Houses" depicting the ladies of the gay quar- ter, and on the other a pillar print by Harunobu votions at Sanchi, given five sentences which might instead have been a reminder that the torana, railings, and harmika designs were based on wood. "Coming around the base of the stupa, the path leads to the inviting stairs near the south gate and coils tighter on its way up. The pilgrim is thus sped around faster as the circumference becomes smaller on this higher level. Here the circumambulation of the foun- tain of religious power is performed and the climax of the pilgrimage achieved. As the coiled path loosens on its way down and out, the pilgrim will feel like a kite with the line meted out as he flies away back home; the other end of the line, still wound around the spool, will at once restrict his freedom and guar- antee his stability." The illustrations are small but serviceable and in some cases beautiful. Professor Wu's own photograph of the giant outcropping of rock that houses the Lomas Rishi cave and its companions in the Barabar Hills suggests better than any other in the reviewer's ex- perience the awe-inspiring qualities that must have powerfully encouraged the impulse to worship within the living rock. A curious secondary idea, nowhere clearly explained in the text, is responsible for a draw- ing (fig. 136) that shows the main, axial buildings of the Peking palace as if they were mounting the steep front face of a pyramid; the caption merely runs "Plan of Peking interpreted as volume."

This must be one of the most fascinating books ever to have been produced on the arts and crafts of Japan, certainly in this particular branch of it, about which so much less is known in the West than about ceramics, painting, colour-printing or statuary, which have already inspired such a rich literature. The author is herself artist and enthusiast, col- lector and student. Her frank acknowledgment to the scholarship of Professor Nomura does not minimize the magnitude of her task in presenting the evolution and achievement of the costume arts against a back- ground of the history, drama, and art of the Japanese.
