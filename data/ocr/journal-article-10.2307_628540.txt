<plain_text><page sequence="1">APETH AND BIA IN EURIPIDES' HERAKLES DESPITE the discussions of a hundred years, the unity of Euripides' Herakles remains a problem. Most scholars have distinguished in the play three parts whose limits are marked by the apparition of Lussa with Iris (814) and by Herakles' recovery from madness (Io88): but over the relationship of these three parts to each other and to the whole there has been little agreement. It is this relationship which I propose to consider.' The problem is baldly stated by Muiller2 who contented himself with complaining of the lack of unity involved in the 'combination in one piece of two actions so totally different as the deliverance of the children of Herakles from the persecutions of the blood-thirsty Lykos, and their murder by the hands of their frantic father'. Wilamowitz, followed with elaborations by Verrall, sought to diminish the shock by looking for some continuity between these two events and suggested that the madness developed naturally and gradually, and is already discernible in the earlier utterances and actions of Herakles.3 This view- Herakles the Megalomaniac-finds its way into Murray's Oxford Text and is accepted apparently by Dodds and certainly by Grube.4 But this shock of inconsequence is essential to the drama, and later scholars'-Parmentier, Kitto, Ehrenberg-have quite rightly repudiated the megalomania theory.5 Mfiller was wrong in the first place to consider the relationship of two parts of a drama without the third. This sort of procedure leads to conclusions like that of Murray who in his discussion begins with part iii, alludes briefly to part ii and not at all to part i: he pronounces the play 'broken-backed'.6 Kitto on the other hand looks for 'one unifying idea'. But though he suggests one, he does not satisfactorily solve the difficulties he himself finds in part i ('Dramatic feebleness like this ... the scenes are flat ... dramatising a negative', etc., 240-2), and of Stasimon ii he concludes that it is 'neither itself a unity nor has it any connexion with the action or the thought' (265 cf. 244);7 and it is understandable that Norwood is unconvinced and reverts to the verdict of Murray.8 The only unhesitating, and I think successful, champion of the play's unity is J. T. Sheppard, in a paper which seems, strangely, to have been little noticed in subsequent discussions.9 Accepting the division into 'three episodes each excellent' Sheppard shows 1 This article is developed from a paper read to the Edinburgh Classical Association in January 1959.

Norwood sees the action of this play as 'falling into halves' and calls all such plays 'ram- shackle' (46). He is correct when he goes on to deplore attempts to 'force unity of action on recalci- trant material' since unity of action in his sense (unbroken sequence of cause and effect) is no more essential to dramatic unity than strict unity of time. But for that same reason 'falls into halves' and 'ramshackle' are misguided and misleading ex- pressions. 9 J. T.

This is a traditional Greek view and therefore easily discerned by the audience in its successive embodiments throughout the play-in the wealth of the conventional tyrant Lykos; in the friendship of Theseus; both prepared for by the allusions of Amphitryon to friendship and to wealth by the royal but fallen Megara. The aged weakness of the Chorus is the antithesis of strength, and strength is embodied above all in Herakles for whom it becomes also 'the source of his calamity'. The relevance of the choral odes is to be found in their handling of these themes, especially that of Herakles' strength. This is a valuable thesis because it leads us to see that the recurrence of the themes implies in the action of the play a coherent abstract argument-What is the relative validity of human OtAla, strength and wealth ? What is their relationship to the circumstances of human life-or, as the Greek stage put it, to the Olympian gods ? The existence of such an argument I would make my point of departure; but thereafter I would like to suggest some modifications. My bare summary does little justice, of course, to Sheppard's subtlety, but still he is somewhat rigid in his allocation of themes to characters. The unity which he demonstrates is perhaps too mechanically formal. The organic structure of the plot will become more apparent if we consider the interrelationship of these themes as subordinates of a further general concept-dpET': and particularly we must re-examine the relationship between Herakles' strength and his dpET-q. In this way I hope to demon- strate more fully the unity inherent in the play's three parts. It is the first part of the play which has been criticised most adversely. The charges are that it is melodramatic, and that it is flat and largely irrelevant.'0 Euripides' reason for writing this as melodrama I shall consider at the end of my paper. My concern now is with the charge of flatness and irrelevance: and here we need to justify only the first 500 lines, since the 200 lines of part i which follow the entry of Herakles may be melodramatic, but their brisk relevance cannot be doubted. As to the relevance of the opening scenes-and perhaps we should note that the details of their plot form Euripides' largest single free invention in his handling of the traditional material" so that it would be surprising if they were not relevant-we may be helped by considering first the ode which occurs towards the end of part i-Stasimon ii (637-700)-in which Euripides has himself conveniently provided us with an even more complete distillation of the play's argument than in the merely gnomic allusion to wealth, strength and friendship in the closing lines of the work.'2 Herakles has just completed his Labours, he has rescued his children and is on the point of killing Lykos. The ode that follows contains a central reflexion on dpETq. It looks back (680 ff.) to the dperT of Herakles just displayed: it looks forward (655 ff., 669) to the brutal stupidity of the gods with which he is about to be rewarded. Only here in part i could both these reflexions occur. Earlier Herakles had been despaired of: after the death of Lykos the Chorus do not question-they extol the justice of the gods (738 ff.). Here only can they prompt the question which I take to be Euripides' prime concern in the play as a whole-What is the place of human d'pEr4 in the universe? If the gods approve it, why do they not give a bavEpqv XapaKT'p dpEra~7 (659)? 'Aper4 is good and Youth is good-v~Edras~ Glov akd (637): both in their way the prime of life. These then should coincide in renewed youth, 'S8vpov iflav, a return from death (657, 661) for those who have &amp;pEr4. So the passing of Time would be on the side of the just, instead of bringing the Avypd~v dvLodv TE yipas' (649) which so prominently throughout part i has prevented 10 E.g.

Yet just for this precise moment Herakles has returned, one good man back from Hades.'3 But only for this moment. In an instant the harmony will be shattered by Hera's sending of Madness. We shall be left again to realise that the gods do not possess aVTVEaS Kal oobla Kar' dvspas (655)14 and to ask the question of Jvr. a'-What is the place of human apErI in the universe ? This question, with its concentration on JdpErT7 is, I would like to show, a more helpful formulation of the 'abstract argument' of the play than one which includes only q?Lta, strength and wealth. These are indeed themes, but the JpE'?rI question is more than a theme. It is the play: the inexplicable overthrow by Hera of the conventional dpETr' of Herakles followed by his recovery of a further JpETr prompt and (tragically) answer precisely this question. If JpETr1, then, is the hub of the wheel, and the subordinate topics of the ode-Youth, Age and the passage of Time, Tyranny and Wealth-are the conditions under which apE-r4 is realised, and at the same time the actual themes of the drama, the spokes which radiate from the hub to every part of the play, we must, in attempting to justify the opening scenes, keep in mind the relationship of these themes to the architectonic question 'What is dpEr4 ?' In part i cdpErq is most obviously embodied in Herakles, as Amphitryon, Megara and the Chorus constantly remind us. His &amp;pETr4, pre-eminently displayed in the Labours- yEvwalcv apETal rrdvwov (357)-is the inspiration of their hope and in despair of their forti- tude (cf. 294).15 When he does arrive he exercises JpE-r4 as it was generally understood- roZs 9b)Aots 7' Evac qdov, ,rd 7r' dXpd, 1taZv (585-6)-by saving his family and killing Lykos. This is generally admitted, but is not by itself enough to occupy 50o lines.'6 What positive function of their own have the minor characters ? Part of the answer is Sheppard's- they embody the themes, Amphitryon b&amp;Ala, Lykos 7rAoioros, Megara the instability of riches, the Chorus lack of ao'vos. To this we may add what we have learnt from Stasimon ii. They as well as Herakles embody &amp;pmrj: it is they who first present, in their reaction to the threat of death, the Chorus's question at 655 ff.: what is dpET-r? This they do in a series of three 'debates' which the continually increasing threat of death saves from being merely theoretical: the Prologue provides a discussion between Megara and Amphitryon: Episode Ia (140-251) one between Amphitryon and Lykos; Ib (278-347) one between Amphitryon and Megara whose conclusions are carried forward into Episode 2a (451- 513). The conditioning circumstances of the debate develop, but the topic is the same throughout. How are they to face death? What would be the choice of the Jv-jp dptcTos (io5)? Amphitryon and Megara propose two very different answers to this question. The difference emerges in the Prologue and is completely developed by the end of Episode Ia. In Megara's opinion their doom is inescapable, oKE^Zv 8E rdSdK7lp' 03 XPi4 (92). One must, therefore, as she explains later (284-9, 294, 307-8), accept it as nobly as one can. But Amphitryon believes that one should never give up hope, never cease to look for the possibility of helping oneself.

H. O. CHALK stances to man's intentions, and the JPErII of the stricken Herakles, which endures whatever happens with acceptance. The debate between Amphitryon and Lykos in Episode Ia appears at first more theoretical than the first discussion. Lykos has arrived: Amphitryon's 'hope' seems even less justifiable-rv' AS' AK~V 7, ELUOpa-TE p7 OavE4iv; as Lykos asks on arrival (144); and he himself not so much concerned to dissuade Lykos from his purpose as to affirm angrily his own view of the nature of good action. For him this means, obviously, a defence of Herakles. In Lykos' eyes Herakles is already dead in Hades: therefore no true son of Zeus: hence an impostor in his claims to Ety Evla; a coward who fights merely with beasts (145-64). For Amphitryon he is the EArOAds, the v4np ptu-ros (171-87), and he heightens his lustre by contrasting it with the ELtla of Lykos (210, 235)--his rotlal7 with the meanness of that &amp;vAJ/cEa in whose name Lykos had justified child-murder (166); his exploits with Lykos' nonentity (182-7); his high birth with the other's upstart intrusion into Thebes (208-12).s1 This flat contrast as such primarily serves Euripides' melodrama, whose intention we are to discuss later. Here our business is with Amphitryon's concern for the quality of Herakles and the Fatherhood of Zeus in themselves. These are less purely theoretical subjects than might appear, since they form the ground of Amphitryon's original definition of Jdper in terms of hope. 'EAids here means the return of Herakles (97) and this depends on his bravery and, more, on his descent from Zeus, which should ensure the god's good-will. That, however, is Zeus' affair not his, as Amphitryon begins by saying (170); but as far as lies within his power, if he could really persuade Lykos of Herakles' worth, he might make Lykos desist from his violent intention. 'EMAids is still the basis of Amphitryon's argument in that scene, but in the third debate, between Amphitryon and Megara (Episode Ib, 278-347), the circumstances have changed. Lykos has refused to reason19 and Megara's noble despair now carries conviction. She specifically rejects Amphitryon's theory--r v acrv EArrlSa (295): she calls on his E dyvEta (3o8)---oK lVEKTOV ELAa GavEmiv a' 2V o (289): she would not even wish to save her sons 8'eav KaK7V Aao'dvTas (291). And now that the circumstances have changed Amphitryon (who is a E vEVIs) consents. We also note that, as the renunciation of his doctrine of hope logically demands, he disowns, not the Herakles whose return was the immediate ground for hope, but, significantly, Zeus, whose parentage should have been the guarantee of his return (339-47). Here is the same disillusionment with the gods as we saw in the second verse of Stasimon ii, and which we are to meet again in part iii--dpE'r E VLKW 0 TV17S V (342) ...

The speech of Megara is designed simply to concentrate attention on the (silent) children; properly, since their fate at the hands of Lykos or of Herakles is the occasion of the tragedy.20 But Amphitryon at the end of the scene reverts for the last time to the topic of the 'debates', his hope of Zeus' help (cf. Megara's appeal 490-5 and the answer 520-I); and for the last time, heightening the contrast with Herakles' arrival, he renounces it-cos Arilsas gpLv c0 Xpdvos o UK ul'ra-ct Ud  (506-7; cf.

But so, we must now add, does the Chorus, though more obliquely, by evincing a quality common also to Megara and Amphitryon--Ala. All alike, in contrast to Lykos and Herakles, are what Amphitryon calls dooeEvEs 0.oL (cf. 228).21 And for the connexion of this with &amp;pE E we need only refer again to Stasimon ii. There we saw that the Chorus lament not simply for their weakness in age, but that the passage of Time has no regard for the deserts of peTJq. This is also the relevance to the main theme of their complaints of feebleness elsewhere: and Amphitryon is like them in this respect.22 They know what is right but are powerless. Time has made them sounds without substance (II 1-12, 229), aOGevE~~ 1b oL. Their LAlac shorn of OE'vos is their O&amp;pEr-or all that remains of it. For of all the themes -ObAla, wealth and tyranny, Time, strength and aged weakness-OeAla is the most intimately related to d&amp;pE-r; a Greek commonplace expressed in Amphitryon's T70oZs t oLs, 7' EtLva dAhov (585).23 The other themes are conditions under which &amp;pErq4 is realised: but cLAla is more than a condition. The word is almost interchangeable with cdpE~4. In Stasimon ii, though expressed for Herakles, ObAla is not named; but &amp;pLE--r is. And for the same reason in part iii b0oL, tAhla are named repeatedly,23 apE-rnL hardly at all. But this does not mean that &amp;pE--r, embodied in the suffering Herakles, is not the topic of part iii; only that LtAla is the essential characteristic of this cpcEnr. This relationship of tLAla to op~ET- which becomes finally explicit in Theseus and Herakles is already emergent, another positive contribution, in part i in the tLAla of Megara, Amphitryon and the Chorus, no less than in that of Herakles, which prompts him to exercise his &amp;pE- on their behalf. Conversely it is the lack of tLAla in Zeus which immediately leads Amphitryon to infer the absence of dpET' in the god--orb 8' 0u' 'p' or(rov 'dKELS Elvc t Aos O. L PEE7 UE VKC;K (341-2, cf. 346-7). Lykos too lacks a&amp;pE-r4 because he lacks Alla: 1425-6 are incidentally a complete verdict on him as well. But this correlation of dpErn4 and tLAla obviously needs to be modified. Though often in practice interchangeable, they are not actually synonymous. For illustration we need look no further than Amphitryon's statement of conventional Greek thought: 0oZts 1AOLs 7)' dEvaC OdAov is complemented by -rC 7' xOpa ,orUEv: and in precisely this conjunction is involved the dilemma on which the whole tragic content of the play depends. In an ideal world E 8pav might have been the whole sum of dper-: EL 8t E'oLS 4v VVE'ULti Kcc O a Kacv' v8pas . .. no doubt it would. But the gods have ordained that &amp;pErT should also involve KcaKc S paiv. Hence this tragedy. This is to anticipate a point which must be fully examined when it becomes explicit in part iii: but we must anticipate since it is already foreshadowed in part i. At this stage the imperfections of the existing order are represented by the betrayal of Time, which not only fails to reward dpETr but even incapacitates it by old age, and rewards evil.24 Herakles 21 Sheppard is wrong to allow no more to the Chorus than aged weakness (74); just as there is more in Amphitryon than qgtLia and in Megara than fallen greatness. 22 Chorus: 107-29, 268-71, 312-14, 436-41.

CHALK can admittedly practise his JpETr. But on the other hand Lykos too can act, whereas Amphitryon and the Chorus are too old; the sons of Herakles are too young; Megara is not a man. Yet despite this nonsensical lack of rapport between man's vision and the gods' dispensation, which the Chorus complains of in Stasimon ii, Megara, Amphitryon and the Chorus nevertheless clearly make the assumption that there is still some course of action open to the weak which, however ineffective, will constitute &amp;pEWr: tdElo TE t-lrtz"' av3pop o1IK rrTWuTrov says Megara (294). It is reminiscent of Aristotle's statement that for man, woman and slave different criteria of perg apply.25 At the time and for those concerned they all display valid though different aperal: and this, again, anticipates part iii, where the apEr4 of the stricken Herakles is one of acceptance, not of traditional Herculean achieve- ment, but is none the less valid. Enough has been said to justify part i per se, and the increasing need to refer to part iii in explanation of it suggests that we should now consider the relationship of these two parts from the standpoint of the closing scenes. The subordinate characters of part i have put before us two basic kinds of &amp;p'eal--we might call them the Cdper4 of active achievement, and that of impotent endurance. The Herakles of part i embodies, as traditionally, the first kind: but in part iii his suffering leads him to display the second. In such a summary unity begins to appear. It will be revealed completely by a further question: What is the relationship between these two presentations of Herakles ? What single judgment are we to pass on these two dpe?ral relative to each other ? On this question it will be convenient to start by considering the opinion of Wilamowitz, since it is in my view erroneous in a basic way not fully corrected in any subsequent dis- cussion. Wilamowitz (127-8) holds that the Herakles of part iii exhibits a higher &amp;pET4 which repudiates the &amp;pern of part i. The corollary is that the Herakles of part i was after all only a megalomaniac, and his quality not a&amp;pEr4 at all. As to the megalomania theory I need not repeat its refutation by Kitto (24 1-3).26 Parmentier (5) and Ehrenberg ( 59), too, hold that the greatness and goodness of Herakles is 'the predominant impression we derive'. The onset of madness was, as our first impression suggests, sudden and unmotivated. We may add that it is possible to point to the precise line at which it begins- 867-with a suddenness confirmed by the Messenger's narrative at 928-33. But if Herakles was good and great throughout, if the &amp;perT of part i is truly &amp;per?, in what sense can we speak of its rejection in part iii ? Wilamowitz' suggestion of megalomania saves him from this inconsistency: but it is illogical in Parmentier (8) to reject megalomania, yet follow Wilamowitz' view that the active &amp;pEr4 is repudiated by that of part iii. If, as I agree we must, we rehabilitate the Herakles of part i, we must reassess Wilamowitz' judgment of the relationship intended by Euripides between the earlier and the later forms of dperT. The view I wish to substitute is, briefly, that the dpETr of part iii certainly includes more than that of part i, but does not annul it. They differ because the circumstances which evoke them differ: but the 'old' is retained. And the necessity of retaining it arises from the tragic view of life expressed in the play. According to Wilamowitz the 'new' Cper4j consists essentially in the renunciation of flla. Bia is 'hateful to god'27 and Euripides is offering a reformed conception of dper intended to sweep away the traditional Epic ideal of Dorian manliness. The reformed Herakles of part iii having renounced ria is inter- preted as wholly passive. To answer this it is necessary for us to deny (a) the passivity of the 'new' Herakles and (b) its alleged cause, the renunciation of fla. 25 Ar. Pol. 126oa2o; Po. 1454a21.

According to rational human judgment Herakles is still noble- KaA's ,yap ad-oZs~ m-'ebavos' 'EAA'vcov Vio I avSp' E'aOABv CEAovvrgas EV'KAelas rvXev (1334-5). The gift of Theseus consists in providing a motive such as can prompt Herakles in new circumstances himself to discover a new way to exercise his &amp;dpElr' instead of destructively in suicide.30 With dper' itself he could not present him. 'New' or 'old', d&amp;pErn is an activity, not a passive state; and even if we speak of Herakles displaying acceptance, such acceptance entails endurance. 'EyKap-Ep'aw fo8-Oiov are not the words of a passive figure.3 In the last lines of the play (1406-17) corrupt and obscure though they are, perhaps we see Herakles going if anything beyond Theseus in realising the implications of his new resolve.32 His desire to look upon his dead children and embrace his father is a demonstration of tA'la whose significance we are now able to appreciate fully. But Theseus gently rallies him: to Theseus this is still mere unmanliness (1407, 14io, 1412). He does not fully understand the new dper4 to which his arguments have helped his friend. Herakles who has experi- enced understands (141*): and to convince Theseus he has to contrast his own condition now with that of Theseus when he was in Hades-he still possesses A-ag despite his circum- stances (1415-17). The passage serves also, of course, to underline finally for the audience what might be less familiar in the new conception of dper4: but in my present context the important point is that it is Herakles who underlines it for Theseus, not vice versa. A particular passage is adduced by Wilamowitz (Io9) in support of his view. At 1386-8 Herakles requests Theseus' help in taking Kerberos back to Argos. To Wilamowitz this is evidence that 'Herakles feels no match for the vanquished Kerberos' and 'will under- take no more exploits'. This is more than the Greek says. Herakles asks Theseus to join him in the task (av'yKatE, vUyrVKarTUr UOv, not 'do it without me') because in his sorrow he cannot bear to be alone: this, that he requires friendship (perhaps-though this is not 28 For their qilMa see note 23. Amphitryon's function in part iii is to support Theseus' role by his paternal pg.lta (1111-13, 12o6, 1220, 1409). Here he also implies a judgment on Zeus whose fatherhood Herakles accordingly rejects (1265). Note the contrast of Amphitryon's feelings with Zeus' implied in IO65-8 as against I086-7. Amphitryon also introduces the idea of plaqca by his fear not of death but that Herakles may kill his own father (1072-6, f. o056). 29 1294-8 describe nature's rejection of the polluted killer (placl a); 1281-9o its counterpart, vMaKA)esa, the social ostracism which followed from belief in pldacqa.

Theseus thinks this cowardice. Herakles (141 ) shows it not to be. Theseus (I412) still misunderstands. I4I3 (H.) 'Is my living a low act? You didn't think so just now.' 1414 (Th.)

(b) Another passage mentioned by Wilamowitz (129) brings us to our next problem, the alleged renunciation of /la. At I235 he understands Herakles' '?wvEr' - E' pdras 84E or' dK vaivottac to mean that his rescue of Theseus from Hades is the only one of his former deeds which Herakles does not now disown as tainted with Pla. In some contexts it could have meant this: but it need not. In this context Euripides is concerned from (I214) Theseus' first words to 1238 to build up the important theme of CAIa. The intro- duction of so significant a new idea as Wilamowitz sees here would hardly have been slipped in en passant, isolated from its context and stated only obliquely by implication. Euripides was a practical dramatist. The line simply means 'I agree: (whatever else I deny in your argument) we are friends'. But we can go beyond this negative argument to disprove the renunciation of Plt, for Herakles immediately before the Kerberos passage expressly says that he does not renounce his former deeds. At 1377-85 he addresses the symbol of his &amp;pErT (in this play as traditionally), his bow and arrows.33 With them he killed his wife and children. Can he bear to carry them still? Yet with them -4 K LUAArT iE'irpa' v 'EAAJd8, and with them he will defend himself in future against his enemies (1382-4). He resolves to keep them-but dOAws (1385). This means that we must cease to speak of an 'old' apEr4- and a 'new' dpErr4 as separate states. The 'old' JpETr4 is an ingredient of the 'new'. But the 'new' also includes understanding, induced by suffering, of the hateful implications of action.34 Herakles' decision here is crucial to the tragedy as such. The mere rejection of the admittedly distasteful implications of action may be pathetic in a broken man; or edifying; but it is not tragic.35 Nor would the practical possibility of such a rejection have been imaginable for a Greek-even Euripides.36 In taking back his bow Herakles recognises that not all circumstances37 are to be met by tears and acquiescence and this is tragic precisely because it does not mean that therefore PIl' is not hateful. On the contrary, rPa through him destroyed his wife and sons. Wilamowitz' tLLoEZ y p o" E T7)v fPlav is from another play (Hel. 903). In this play rather LTEZ ltv dvalvOpwros: but god ordains it, and man must--dhiows -be the agent of what he hates. This takes us back to the tragic dilemma contained in that other line: apEr7 is both, T0s EoIs 7' Ea ET Tov AV 7' ExOup AEILx v (585-6). This view of the relationship of the two dpETal makes a unity of parts i and iii. We must now briefly discuss the relevance of part ii in its light. The intervention of Hera through Iris and Lussa actively demonstrates our last conclusion. Far from hating Pla, 33 (a) The bow is used throughout the play with tragic effect as the symbol of Herakles' dp er--zd~a .. ... ape dzkevpdg, 3 euoi -x'  $crsto (Io098-I Ioo cf.

(b) The consequent tragic dilemma of 138i x-s-' oaow;-is paralleled by the use of the traditional KaGtiLVtKOg (e.g. t KajltAVKq) . .. .O 570) in the context both of traditional prowess (49, 570, 582, 681, 789) and of child-killing (961, 1046). (c) Parallel to the bow's function of asso- ciating the Labours and the child-killing is Euripides' alteration of the traditional chronology. He places the killing after the Labours and so makes them a continuous series (zdv oilaOtov rdvov ... .arat6oKTovipaag, Reiske at 1279; cf. AloaOtov at 23). All involve lia (dy j :apeaKes6vaov O&amp;K/UzOf5VP flaq 1369) but all in the bow are accepted. 34 Hence too Herakles finds the 'new', complex dpe~i harder than the simple 'old', i353-7, 14i I. 35 Thus Ehrenberg, accepting Wilamowitz' assess- ment of Herakles' later dpes-ri ('his future life will be without heroic deeds, even without any real con- tent'-163) but affirming his early greatness (159) sees the whole as melodrama ending in anticlimax (16I, 163) not tragedy. 36 Wilamowitz (i33) likens Herakles to Troades. But Troades complains of gratuitous and unnecessary flia: Herakles accepts, though sorrowfully, the inevitability of some flia in all action. 37 Wilamowitz (130) sees Herakles' rejection of suicide as part of a total rejection of flia. But it is rejection of flia only in these circumstances.</page><page sequence="9">APETH AND BIA IN EURIPIDES' HERAKLES I5 the Olympians too belong to the same world as the violent Lykos. El S 8oEot 7'v rVVEUGr Kat  oGla KaT' dv8pas . . v.vy 8 Hera is the murderess of Megara and the children. She embodies P/la and when Herakles while hating her acknowledges her ("Hpa KpaTc7E38) he is acknowledging that 3ta is part of our divinely decreed state just as he was in taking back his bow. The shock of this revelation at part ii is heightened by the Chorus's misguided celebration of Olympian 1&amp;Kr' in the triumphant Stasimon iii immediately before it (734-814, note especially the juxtaposition of 814-15). But it is man only who envisages the higher ideal. This play offers no divine support for it.39 It is a tragedy because while affirming the validity of man's vision it insists that this is thwarted by divine decree. In view of other interpretations of part ii it is necessary to insist on two points in detail. First, the amorality of the gods must not be palliated. When we see Lykos struck down we may be tempted, like the Chorus, to suppose OEotL Eot c'%Jv 8'Kw(v LEova L Kac 7~iv d cTov raMLEw (772): but when they promptly strike down the best of men, fresh from this act of justice and in the moment of sacrificing to themselves, we see we were wrong. But we must not complain of the lack of motivation. That is Euripides' point. The Olympians are without rational motives, completely unaware of the demands of human reason. Justice is a human vision. 'ApEj-or VE vKc Ovp7 t6Yv OE&amp;Y yav Amphitryon had rightly said of Zeus (342): PCLca06s nS Et 0EoS ) 1ial(OS Oi3K US (37).40 Similarly only man displays OtlAa. AlKata To01 TEKOVTa5 9EAE^V 7-TEKva the Chorus tells Herakles (583). He tried to and so did Amphitryon (e.g. 317): Zeus did nothing, and Amphitryon is the father whom Herakles acknowledges (1265). Olympian gods lack all human qualities.41 Secondly, Herakles-who does possess human dpEr4, 8tKatuolvwv, tAla-is wholly good throughout. If we look for Jpaprtap, signs of ;Pl/p~s or megalomania, we shall dilute the responsibility of Hera and so blur the point of the play. The relevance of Hera's inter- vention is that it is entirely hers and entirely inappropriate (831, 846). The greatness of Herakles provides the occasion of her attack; but it is not even the motive, far less the cause, and there is no iflpr. She, not it, is the sole 'source of his calamity'.42 Of course a play could have been written putting the view that 'a man's faults lie in himself'. But here Euripides' aim was to externalise the Pi'a in which Herakles was involved, and so draw the distinction between human values and their irrational circumstances; to say rather 'there are irrational elements in life'. This is represented notably in his handling of the madness. This madness is not (as Wilamowitz and Verrall supposed) a personal failing, perceptibly developing. Lussa is the pawn of Hera completely: and though she must obey she is unwilling (858-61) thus completely dissociating herself from Herakles. It is repugnant 38 I253. Cf. I303-7, 1311-12, I393 (where the ambiguity of "Hpa; zzx l recalls 20-1 e6'O' "Hpag edtve toi XpOwv; cf. 1357 tzVX' 6ovkrvdov). Ttig and Xpdowv also at 307-1 I, 509, 1314-15, 1396. 39 Herakles' so-called Platonic speech (1341-6) is no exception. As Kitto shows (246) Herakles is subsequently 'a very imperfect Platonist'. But even within the speech four of the six lines are only a statement of what we have already learnt, that gods are not human: if they have not human virtues nor have they human vices. The remaining couplet is not as Verrall and Greenwood see it, the corner- stone of the play. It is merely an allusion to con- temporary speculation, insufficient to cancel opti- mistically the tragic resignation of the play as a whole. 40 Cf. 212 t' ZEg dt Katia elev sd ?pagi cpp Qvag. The same is implied in Stas. iii: the Chorus, mis- takenly attributing 6iKy to Zeus, associates with it his Fatherhood (800-5). For the typically Euripi- dean d~iaO;4g, of Zeus, at 347, cf.

The position is nicely illustrated in a quotation kindly sent me by Professor Kitto: 'The sea does not assume its royal blue to please you. Its brute and dark desolation is not raised to overwhelm you; you disappear because you happen to be there.' (H. M. Tomlinson, The Sea and the Jungle.) 42 Megalomania has been discussed. "Yflptg is misleadingly suggested in phrases like 'sin of great- ness' (Grube, 256); 'More than Nature can long endure' (Kitto, 247); even Ehrenberg's (I6o) 'No fault, no crime, his greatness alone is the reason for Hera's envy and hatred', suggests q~Odvog, discussed below.</page><page sequence="10">16 H.

The Pfl whose extreme form this madness represents is thus distinguished from the properly human as an external circumstance.43 A i3p~s or at least a 0odvos interpretation of part ii might be suggested by Iris' words at 841-2-Herakles must suffer q GEot %Iv o3qapov ba GOvq/r 3' 'rcat ipjEyd&amp;a iaP 8dv'ros 81,K7rv. But even fOdvos, certainly ;flpts, suppose a system where occurrences however unjust are predictable; whereas Euripides' Olympians are completely chaotic; and the suggestion must be resisted. This is one of many paradoxes which arise as soon as gods are conceived in human form. Euripides was well aware of these and exploited them fully;44 but the gods are really utterly irrational. If, however, we do give them human form, we can only express this irrationality by crediting them with motives so low as to be virtually sub- human. So here the repugnantly primitive B6dvo6-sense of the word &amp;'K77, the most exalted Iris can attain to, contrasts with the lofty conception repeatedly voiced in the immediately preceding ode (737, 740-1, 755-6, 772-80, 813-14). The explanation is the same when Theseus at 1244 warns Herakles P)7 i'dya AE'ywv PLEZov 7T0s, and the other describes his persecution by Hera (1263 ff.): both are assuming anthropomorphic gods and speak accordingly. But Stasimon ii, Herakles' and Amphitryon's rejections of Zeus, the 'Platonic' speech (see note 39), above all the manner of Hera's intervention, make it plain that the Olympians really possess no human motives at all. They stand for a cosmic irrationality which recalcitrantly thwarts human JpEr77 even at its Herculean best. But this insistence on the goodness of Herakles brings before us now one final problem. How in part i is it possible to represent this undiluted &amp;peTr yet represent as well the P3a which we now see to be its inevitable concomitant in action? To represent the &amp;pErT of a suffering Herakles after the disaster consistently with a hatred of Pi3a was by comparison straightforward. But how to represent his heroic action as inevitably tainted by the imperfection of things, yet make clear that nevertheless the man is still cptorToo ? Vice versa, how to show that KaK63 9 8pav is indeed a part of apErq yet is still KaKdv ? For Euripides this was a practical stage problem, and his solution was to begin by establishing with unshakeable certainty that Herakles is all good, and only then to complicate the picture by showing how 9l1a nevertheless enters into good action.45 That is, he began by writing a melodrama: so that our discussion here becomes the defence which I proposed to offer against the criticism that part i is melodramatic. Part i is black and white: Pl'a too is represented undiluted in Lykos, as &amp;per- in Herakles. But the details of the two characters are drawn with such close parallelism that in retrospect Herakles, though by now we know him to be good, is seen nevertheless to be affected by the very flia which possessed Lykos. The point at which one is brought to see this is under the impact of the outrageous irruption of madness and the killing of the children. The essential difference between Lykos and Herakles-their motives for action-the killing of the children does not cancel; but it does reveal what actions good and bad alike have in common-violence. Throughout part i, therefore, Lykos and Herakles alone are capable of action, and their actions are point for point alike.46 Lykos 'removed' his political rival Kreon; Herakles 'murdered' Lykos. Lykos proposed to 'take precautions' (E,T/3C-Ea) against Kreon's 43 Grube (255-6) notes the externality of the madness, but combining it (surely illogically?) with a theory of 6flptg and megalomania turns it into a criticism of the man not of the gods. 44 Euripides accepted the myth as a convenient vehicle. It is not his aim (as Wilamowitz argues, 134) to rationalise and reject it, making Herakles 'bring his sins down on his own head'. 45 His success in doing this enables him to repre- sent 87ztEtK?)q dvip lujTafldBAAov '$ sT3vXia e votrvyiav and yet evoke 'pity and fear' not 'disgust" (Ar. Po. 1452b35). 46 Perhaps the allusions to the past violence of Amphitryon's career (16, 6o, 1077, 1258) support this theme.</page><page sequence="11">APETH AND BIA IN EURIPIDES' HERAKLES 17 family, Herakles to 'butcher' Lykos' partisans. We may interchange the verbs according to our sympathies but all are deeds of violence. Linguistically this is expressed by Lykos' absurdly extravagant arrangements for disposing of his victims (240-51) and Herakles' almost mock-heroic threats of vengeance on the traitors (565-73). Wilamowitz and Verrall were right in detecting a note of over-emphasis in Herakles' speech too; only its purpose is not as they thought to show Herakles already half-mad in the ordinary sense, but to suggest by its similarity to Lykos' bombast that violence forces its way into all action. Again, Lykos suffers, as Amphitryon warned him--la S 3pda'r P'v rrAloD /l3/av (215) and so does Herakles suffer Hera's 8la47-not mortally, though that too would have ensued if human friendship had not had the power in this one case to overcome fla. Both are human and suffer; and in the mood of compassion evoked by the disaster we may see that the killing even of a villain is pitiable: -rd ' xr6Opa LLEaEv is no less terrible for being necessary. But above all Herakles achieves what Lykos would have liked to do: he kills Megara and the children. And more. Lykos at least never intended to shed blood at the altar (240, 319: contrast Herakles at 922, 995, II145). Of course Herakles was possessed by Hera. But now Euripides introduces a new disturbing element. Herakles thought they were Eurystheus' children whom he was killing (970). Suppose they had been; and Herakles responsible for his actions? Certainly Amphitryon, though he protested against Lykos (206-7) appears to accept that child-killing is practical politics (39-40, 207-9) just as Lykos argued (165-9). With Herakles himself Euripides is careful not to compromise our impres- sion of his goodness by saying definitely that he would kill children when sane; but he hints through the minor characters and through the veil of madness disturbingly enough to evoke an awareness that all fla partakes of the irrational element here embodied in the extreme form of madness. To this extent Amphitryon's suggestion is right---ov' 71 rov odvos ao' CfKXVEUVEV VEKpWV OV~9 P7T K aVELS~; (966-7).48 Wilamowitz' picture (I28) of a megalomaniac brutalised by bloodshed is a caricature: but though Herakles is noble, bloodshed is brutal, the consequence of Cosmic Madness. This is underlined by Euripides' use of the theme of children's innocence as the ideal type of human relationships. In their world what spoils the relationships of adult man and man has by rights no place: oi3 y&amp;p 0opds yE TratoEs taravrau nd,'as (I 176).

This reflexion by Herakles, sig- nificantly his last words before the disaster, is unnecessarily drawn out unless it carries such an ulterior implication. Children evoke man's properly human feelings regardless of wealth and 'worldly' distinctions (633-6).

Child-killing above all else expresses the inhuman, and the good man could only kill his children when entirely possessed by irrational forces-d3 Kavcu oVK E ETraL (865). But this extreme case brings us to see what our concentration on his goodness and justice usually leads us to overlook-that the irrational forces its way into even his good and just activity. To interpret Euripides' use of melodrama followed by 'complication of the picture' in this way may be thought perverse; as though the ultimate admission of riga gave away the whole position first set forth by the 'good' Herakles. I would defend the interpretation in that it accounts for all the details of the play and the manner of their dramatic ordering; and this is our initial task. The criticism if just would then become one of Euripides. But I think it would not be just. His method does not give away the whole position.
