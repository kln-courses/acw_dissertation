MATHEMATICS AND HUMANITIES: ANOTHER APPROACH TO THE CLASSICS At Vanderbilt University it took the National Endowment for the Humanities to put Plato back together again. "Let no one who is not a geometer enter here," read the proverbial inscription over the portals of the Academy; I and yet the partition between philosophy and mathematics, or, more broadly, the humani- ties and the sciences, in our universities has never been more impermeable. A grant from the Endowment supported the development of a new course at my own institution that may serve as one model for helping to breach that barrier. Now, after three offerings of the course, entitled "A Humanities Approach to Mathematics," my purpose here is to describe our experience and to reflect on the implications of such an endeavor for the study of the classics and for the larger cause of the humanities in general. In telling such a story one hopes for a tone general enough to encourage simi- lar innovations, yet sufficiently specific to represent accurately what really oc- curred. Because I suspect that many classicists share an academic history similar to my own, I am inclined briefly to eschew the impersonal and to indicate that at the outset of this project I was a prime example of the "math avoider. " I said so, too, frequently and not without a certain pitiable pride. At my undergraduate in- stitution it had been possible to fulfill one graduation requirement by taking either Greek or mathematics. I took Greek. To meet the minimal remaining re- quirement in mathematics I spent a semester learning, so far as I can recall, how to amortize house mortgages. The risks one takes, however, are never entirely unanticipated. In retrospect I can discern several episodes and interests that prepared the way for this one. C. P. Snow's seminal The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution2 had appeared not long before I graduated from college and formed the basis of a speech I made on that occasion. My dissertation on Boethius did not deal in any conscious way with his mathematical interest but did introduce me to one of the last Platonists and mathematicians of the Roman world. In my teaching, espe- cially in humanities seminars, I had become increasingly conscious of the impor- tance of mathematics to Plato's thought. I had co-authored an article on Pytha- gorean aspects of the design of the Athena temple at Paestum.3 Finally, as a feminist I had begun to see the intellectual and economic costs accruing to women as a result of their traditional avoidance of mathematical studies. Nevertheless, it was not with alacrity that I responded to the suggestion of a visiting professor 4 that I join with Professor B. F. Bryant of our Department of I The evidence for this venerable inscription is late: Elias, Philosphus, In Aristotelis Categorias Commentaria, 118.18, in A. Busse, ed., Comm. in Arist.

Professor Bryant, a former chairman of the department and a gifted teacher who was already offering a course in the history of mathematics, shared my reluctance. My own colleagues, too, were sceptical. "You will never do research in that area," said one. (Although I agreed at the time, this has turned out not to be the case.) "I do not want to encourage any more students to take mathematics," averred another. (He has been pleased, however, when students in our course have continued their study of the classics.) No doubt as a group they thought: "Here goes Susan off on another tangent." (A happy meta- phor, under the circumstances.) The idea continued to germinate, however, and by the time we had completed the proposal we were confident of its merits. The N.E.H. concurred, and we spent the summer of 1980 preparing for the first of- fering of the course the following spring. Before welcoming students to the first class meeting in January, 1981, we had arrived at several working principles that proved to be sound for the duration of the course: 1. We would limit enrollment to thirty students. Large lecture courses in the humanities are a contradiction in terms. 2. We would do "real mathematics." To talk about mathematics and not ac- tually to engage in the subject would be also to violate the spirit of the course. 3. We would encourage other colleagues to participate in the course with us. Fortunately, funds from the N.E.H. grant made it possible to invite two out- standing consultants to work with us during the planning stage5 and several others to visit the course as guest lecturers.6 Our colleagues on our own faculty were also generous with their time and interest, and at least six individuals from four different departments (philosophy, history, classics, and physics) presented guest lectures to the class over a three-year period. 4. We as the two instructors would bring our own teaching styles and metho- dologies to the class. Typically, I would lecture on the cultural and historical aspects of the period under consideration, and Professor Bryant would assign, demonstrate, and discuss mathematical problems of the sort actually engaged in during that period. 5. Finally, this would be a humanities course. As such, we would emphasize writing, reading, and class discussion as processes and the history of ideas as our subject. We had also devised a syllabus that remained fairly constant over the three years. Scope is always a major consideration, and we sought to maintain both breadth and particularity. The emphasis would be on Greek mathematics, but it was obvious that we could neither begin nor end there. We thus began by spend- ing about two weeks on Babylonian and Egyptian mathematics, then proceeded 5 B. Gale Dick, Jr. of the University of Utah and Lynn A. Steen of St. Olaf College. Professor Dick, a physicist, was helpful in that he had engaged in a similar collaboration with a classicist, Barbara Lindsey, at the University of Utah in a jointly taught honors course entitled "The Intellectual Tradition: Philosophical, Literary, and Scientific Land- marks of the West." Mathematician Steen reduced my initial hesitations about the course considerably when, in reply to my protestations that 1 preferred similes and metaphors to numbers, he countered smilingly: "But an equation is a simile!" 6 Other outside guests included Peter Hilton of Case Western Reserve University and the Batelle Seattle Research Center, a mathematician; philosopher Louis 0. Mink of Wesleyan University; Sheila Tobias, now at the University of Arizona; and Joan A. Richards, an his- torian of science at Brown University. Mathematician Robert A. Rosenbaum of Wesleyan University, a former provost and chancellor of that institution, conducted the final evalu- ation of the course for the N.E.H.</page><page sequence="3">PAEDAGOGUS 179 to the Presocratics and the rise of science; Pythagoras and the importance of number; pre-Euclidean mathematics; Plato; Aristotle; Euclid and the impor- tance of Alexandria as a center of learning; Sicily and the work of Archimedes; Roman expansion-the rise of engineering and the twilight of Greek mathema- tics; and Arab mathematics and the intellectual effects of the spread of Islam. Toward the end of the course we dealt briefly with the Middle Ages, then with the work of Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, and Newton.7 Roughly, then, our chronological period extended from the beginnings to the invention of the calcu- lus. At the end of the course, however, we attempted to give some sense of con- temporary issues in mathematics with discussion of the work and thought of Georg Cantor, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, and Kurt Godel. While these assumptions remained in place, others did not. Our biggest sur- prise was our audience. At the outset we had imagined that the course would attract mathematics avoiders who would be drawn to the historical and cultural approach that we presented. What we found instead was an increasing represen- tation of "humanities avoiders," those who were adept in mathematics and sci- ence but were chary of reading and writing and class discussion. This proved to be one of the more gratifying developments for me personally, for my en- thusiasm for attracting students to the joys of the humanities surpasses my sense of duty for sending them out to the other fields that they "really ought to study" in order to be educated persons. Another change was that although we had originally designed the course for freshmen and sophomores, we found that the more mature students benefited most from our inquiries. Consequently, we eventually limited enrollment to juniors and seniors. (After the first year, about twice as many students as we could accommodate registered for the course.) The course was a special boon for those few students at any stage who had strong interersts in both mathematics and the humanities and had not previously been able to explore the interrelation- ships between the two. Further, we continued to experiment with the reading assignments. A. Aaboe's Episodes from the Early History of Mathematics proved too technical and we used it only once. Morris Kline's Mathematics in Western Culture was more useful, and by the third year, the exciting if episodic anthology of Davis and Hersh, The Mathematical Experience, had appeared in paperback.8 Plato's Republic and Meno remained constant, supplemented by various photocopied readings. We continued to see the need, however, for a proper textbook for such a course as this. Lack of a proper text was not, of course, the only problem we encountered. We were never entirely satisfied with the integration of the lecture material with the mathematics of the course. Students were aware of the difficulty, too, and this was the criticism most frequently expressed in student evaluations. This was partly a function of the fact that our material was initially so new each to the other of us that we ourselves were little able to draw the connections. As our experience increased, this problem tended to diminish. Closely related was the difficulty of establishing fruitful grounds for class dis- cussion. Skillful direction of such discussion, as now I see more clearly, requires a surpassing confidence on the part of the instructor that the important issues 7 We knowingly omitted the very important contributions of the Chinese and Hindus to the history of mathematics. 8 A.

Also, Profes- sor Bryant and I tended overly to defer to each other especially during the first year. Again, as we became more experienced we were able more frequently to refer to each other's material and to invite students to engage with us in the dia- logue. Finally, one must be as resourceful as Archimedes at Syracuse in dealing with the bureaucratic hindrances to interdisciplinary and team-teaching activities. The N.E.H. grant helped us over the initial hurdle of being released from our usual departmental teaching duties by compensating our respective departments for one-half course for each of us each year. After the two-year grant expired, the problems here increased, as did the difficulty in acquiring financial support for the course from our own institution. A more disturbing obstruction occurred when a faculty committee, in a blanket restructuring of the curriculum, deter- mined that Humanities 120, "A Humanities Approach to Mathematics," no longer counted as a humanities requirement toward graduation. Nevertheless, the course succeeded. Student interest remained high, and the response of students to the class was heartening. Most had assumed that mathe- matics was the province of right and wrong answers, of unchanging verity, and they were strongly attracted to the discovery that mathematics, just as any other cultural form, has a history of development. Many commented that the course was equally valuable to mathematics avoiders and humanities avoiders. Three or four students went on to major in classics. And one response alone on an anony- mous student evaluation made the experiment worthwhile: "I enjoyed the course the most of any in my spring schedule. The true value lies not in any mathematical or historical fact but in a new outlook concerning the world we live in. Entering this class, I must admit to a sense of frustration with a seemingly impersonal and scientific world. I took shel- ter in my own personal humanism. This course, however, has restored some of my faith in the world and taught me a tolerance for mathematics as an art form. The recognition of the necessity of an alliance between mathema- tics and humanities, science and art, is the true value of this exciting course." For me, as for that student, the course stretched the envelope of my imagina- tion and peopled the world with a splendid new cast of characters. I learned about Thales, Euclid, Eratosthenes, and Heron. I puzzled further over Pytha- goras and learned the importance of Ptolemy's Almagest. I was dazzled by New- ton's eighteen months on his mother's farm during the plague years at Cam- bridge, 1664-66, and his four discoveries that changed our thought.9 I met Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and Descartes. I even learned that James A. Gar- field was the only United States president ever to formulate a proof of the Pytha- gorean theorem. Over the three years I became familiar with perfect numbers, friendly num- bers, abundant numbers, deficient numbers. I discovered the Four Color Prob- lem and learned why the postmark for the University of Illinois at Champaign- Urbana was at one point "Four Colors Suffice" and at another "219,93 is Prime." I came to see that, contrary to the Pythagoreans, all things are not num- ber, and that in fact it may have been the perfection of their geometry that pre- 9 These were 1) the binomial theorem, 2) the calculus, 3) the law of gravitation, and 4) the nature of colors.

I made a Mobius strip and saw the truth of the limerick: A mathematician confided That a Mobius strip is one-sided; And you'll get quite a laugh If you cut it in half, For it stays in one piece when divided. One episode struck with special poignancy. "Casting out nines" is a method for checking arithmetical operations, the key fact of which is that the remainder when a number is divided by nine is the same as the remainder when the sum of the digits is divided by nine.'0 A crucial feature of "casting out nines" is that while it can prove conclusively that an answer is wrong, it cannot prove that it is right. Our class was already familiar with this operation when a distinguished visitor referred to it in a guest lecture: " 'Casting out nines'," said Peter Hilton, "is like the Viet Nam war. For a long time I did not know what was the right thing for us to do, but I knew for sure that what we were doing was wrong." For the first time I gained an empirical analogue for the felt truth that we can know that something is wrong even if we do not know what is right. I also learned to appreciate baseball. Before this course I had not realized that baseball, like chess, is a game of angles and spatial relationships. There is nothing quite as beautiful or as perfectly proportioned as the ninety feet between bases. More pertinent generally for classicists, however, are the enlarged perceptions such a course as this one can give us of our own field. For me, those enlarge- ments were significant and, generally, four in number: 1) The world did not begin with Greece. Studying the Babylonian and Egyp- tian antecedents to Greek mathematics is suggestive of other ways in which we should bring the broader Near Eastern context to our studies of Greek and Roman antiquity. G. E. R. Lloyd makes this point in his study of the develop- ment of Greek science: "The importance of the advances in mathematical mani- pulation that took place in one or the other or both great ancient Near Eastern civilizations must be given full weight. " 1 2) That it was the lonian Greeks and not their predecessors who axiomatized geometry is an important part of the larger intellectual revolution of the sixth century. In my lecture on this subject, I develop ten tentative suggestions toward an explanation of this extraordinary phenomenon: a) There was no theocratic hierarchy guarding access to knowledge. b) No "sacred books" defined truth or inhibited inquiry. c) Religion tended to be anthropomorphic and therefore more conducive to change. d) Unlike Egypt and Babylon, the Greek communities were not highly cen- tralized potamic societies. e) Sea travel and commerce were important and stimulating. f) Competition was a salient feature of community life. g) The importance of rhetoric and oral persuasion in Greek communities encouraged discourse and discovery. 10 Professor Bryant recalls as a child in Bells, Tennessee, watching elderly bank clerks "casting out nines" to check their accounts. 1 0 G. E. R. Lloyd, Magic, Reason, and Experience: Studies in the Origin and Develop- ment of Greek Science (Cambridge 1979) 231.</page><page sequence="6">182 CLASSICAL WORLD h) The Greek language itself is especially subtle and suited for reflective in- vestigation. i) Leisure (schole^) was honored. j) The Greeks were the beneficiaries of Babylon and Egypt. 3) Classicists sometimes underestimate the importance of Alexandria in the advancement and dissemination of learning in antiquity. Certainly those who study Hellenistic literature or, say, the poetry of Catullus and the neoterics at Rome are aware of literary life at Alexandria, but the city's importance for mathematics and science is equally as high and perhaps more enduring. 4) Just as we foreshorten our study of antiquity chronologically on the front end, so do we on the other. A study of ancient mathematics restores to Islam, and especially to the Moorish period in Spain, its rightful role in the spread of ancient learning to the rest of Europe. Gerbert, for example, who became the first French pope in 999 (as Sylvester II), spent his youth studying mathematics in Spain and became perhaps the first person in Christian Europe to use Hindu- Arabic numerals. Adelard of Bath translated Euclid into Latin from Arabic in 1142 and introduced Greek mathematics into England. Gerard of Cremona went also to Spain in the 12th century to learn Arabic in order to understand Ptolemy, and spent the rest of his life translating ancient documents from the Arabic into Latin. Rome was not the only conduit of ancient learning. We who are entrusted with the maintenance of the classical tradition serve that tradition best when we make our understanding of antiquity as spacious as possi- ble. In many ways we are also responsible for the definition of the humanities in general, and there our task is to make connections among the disciplines. The study of ancient mathematics is one way to enlarge the space and multiply the connections. Vanderbilt University SUSAN FORD WILTSHIRE CW79.3 (1986)</page></plain_text>
