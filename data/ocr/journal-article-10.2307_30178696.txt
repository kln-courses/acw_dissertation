<plain_text><page sequence="1">My Organismic Development An autobiographical fragment as a NATATOR By WILLIAM M. LAMERS ULY ULY 1. DEAR DIARY: It caught my eye this morning, "Swimming taught by the most approved modern methods. Class for Teachers Now Being Organized. All our instructors have master's degrees. Ac- credited by the Southwestern Association of Natatoria. How is your organismic de- velopment?" Maybe even I might learn to swim. July 3. I am enrolled! The fee-I shall not think of it. Classes begin July 5. The pool is along the river. July 5. 8 P.M. I was afraid that at my age I would find swimming instruction rather strenuous. But as a matter of fact I am not at all tired. We spent the fore part of the morning discussing the thera- peutic significance of swimming-by the way, the class is largely composed of edu- cators-and then we were given instruction in relaxing. Relaxing is a sine qua non of successful swimming. This afternoon we relaxed. Not in swimming togs, of course. That will come later. After we have de- veloped a readiness. July 6. We picnicked this morning and suddenly found that we were busily engaged in a discussion of swimming as an instru- ment of both utility and culture. There was an interesting clash on the ultimate EDITOR'S NOTE: "I would not presume," says Mr. Lamers, "to swell my fictional auto- biographical mote into a beam were it not for the fact that there seems to be some lesson involved. I wish I knew what lesson." The author of this satire is assistant super- intendent of schools in Milwaukee, Wis. etymology of "cultus." Eurhythmics and somatological engineering were stressed. Very interesting indeed. By some good chance today's instructor, Miss Duzz, carried with her a 6 by 4 foot blackboard and a handful of chalk. When there was a felt need for something to write on she sud- denly exclaimed, "Well of all things, what's this I'm carrying around with me? A black- board? What a fortunate happenstance." July 7. Too busy with what anciently was called "homework" to write to you, dear Diary. July 8. Spent most of the morning think- ing about swimming clothes. Heard a half- hour illustrated talk by Dr. E. Sell of the Art Institute, consultant on costuming, on the subject of "Swimming Ensembles and Their Twofold Functions." He was fol- lowed by Mrs. Counts of the P.T.A. who spoke on "Consumer Problems in the Area of Swimming Suits." Shopping in P.M. Bought vertically striped trunks. July 9. The faculty staffed us this morn- ing and decided we have reached costume readiness so we put on our rigging. I found the experience very stimulating. I was ready for it. A bathing suit contest seemed an indicated extension. July to. Those few of us who seemed to be more advanced were permitted to dip our faces into shallow bowls of water while we paddled the air with our hands. July IIzz. They have called in an expert to make sociograms of the group. Something seems to be amiss. It was noticed: (1) That a certain young lady was attracting more than the average amount of attention from the men of all ages. (2) That the same 283</page><page sequence="2">284 The CLEARING HOUSE young lady was distributing her response unequally among the men. There may be more to this than meets the eye-although that seems to offer some explanation. July 12. The young lady in question won the bathing suit contest. The sociogram- matist reported that she scored highest in acceptability among the men and lowest among the women. . . . We shall get to the water yet. We are now engaged on a handicraft project. The ladies are making small bathing suits for poor children, the men are making miniature diving platforms for hospitals. Tomorrow to the laboratories. July 13. Reading is now being integrated into the core. We have subdivided the class into groups and each has selected a problem. I copied these from the bulletin board listing: Famous Swimmers Bathing Among the Romans Who Was McGinty? The Anthropomorphic Significance of Europa and the Bull Simon Lake and the Submarine Aquatic Life of the Sub-Antartica Was the Sinking of the Lusitania Justified under International Law? Water Imagery in Shelley's "The Cenci" Drinking Habits of the Sumerians The Development of the American Fire Depart- ment The Construction of Backyard Swimming Pools Activated Sludge Sewerage Disposal Systems Dr. Beebe and His Bathysphere The Dorsal Musculature of the Dogfish My own group selected great marine dis- asters. I now can speak with authority on the sinking of the Lady Elgin, the General Slocum, the Morro Castle, the Eastland and the Titanic. I am horribly fascinated -so much so that I neglected to glance at the general assignment of Chapter III of Admiral Alfred Mayer Mahan's Influence of Sea Power on History, last night. July 14. We have organized a choric choir and are learning John Masefield's "Sea Fever." We rehearse next to the river. Very atmospheric. To establish mood the speech instructor Miss Ora Tund brought along a portable phonograph and played such classics as "Asleep in the Deep" and the "Song of the Rhine Maidens." O Altitudo! July I5. Dear Diary: I did not want to worry you but I have been disturbed a little. When would we get into the water? Today-being very warm-I put the ques- tion to Mr. Finney-we call him "Professor." "When you have completed your readi- nesses," he said primly. "And not a moment sooner. Swimming is more than a com- plexus of motor skills. It is an emotional, an aesthetic experience of no mean in- tensity. If you enter the water prematurely your whole subsequent experience as a natator might be conditioned adversely." Then he took from his files several thorough case studies in point and per- mitted us to read them. I am convinced. July I7. Very busy. July I8. Well, we finished the analysis of the waters in which people bathe locally. We found incidentally that the bacteria count outside of our own barrier was a little high and feeling that there must be no arti- ficial dichotomies in education-especially between swimming and citizenship-we sent a committee to visit the commissioner of public works. I should have mentioned the excellent use of audio-visual aids at every step in this course. The sociogram- matic pattern of the group has changed. The young lady now looks at only one of the young men and the rest seem to have lost interest. Dear Diary, could it be-? July iz9. Miss Wilma Dunk of New York City and water ballet fame gave us an hour's talk on the aesthetics of swimming. A quartet sang, "My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean." I felt an inner reaching across waters as I listened, a desire to annihilate watery space. Perhaps I am now emotion- ally ready. July o20. It seems not. Or at least my instructors are of that opinion. Or perhaps the comprehensive readiness has not reached maximum in all significant regards,</page><page sequence="3">MY ORGANISMIC DEVELOPMENT AS A NATATOR 285 the calendars of maturation being various even for the same person. . . . We have taken to painting marine life. When we arrived this morning art materials were present. We stood about for a few moments and then one of the younger members said, "I don't know what suggests this. But I have sheer inspiration. Let's draw and paint, or what have you?" We settled the matter then and there democratically by taking a vote. The demo- cratic concepts have no curricular or vital validity if they do not penetrate into the matter-of-fact relations of the group. The young lady and young gentleman today disappeared for some time. It is whispered that perhaps they are together! July 27. Dear Diary: I am sorry for the seven-day interruption. Yes they were together-in a canoe. I noticed them as I stood at the end of the pier doing my navigation problem. After I saw them I found it hard to concentrate on latitude and longitude, especially when they waved to me and suggested that I had better jump in. Jump in? I fell in. I'm sure I yelled but no one heard me. The class was within, socially preparing a frame of reference on various marine matters for later supple- mentation by sub-committees in the fields of their several explorations. Dear D.: I did drink some water, but then I bethought myself of my dog Nero and his aqueous antics and by imitating these I got myself out-with little help from the two in the canoe, who laughed. I spent two days in bed but somehow I don't feel like going back for the rest of the course. The felt need seems to have been dissipated. Besides, I am now very busily engaged on Volume II of my defini- tive History of Handwriting, intended for use as collateral reading by those who are making the transition from the manuscript to the cursive.</page></plain_text>
