MARCH 13, 1919 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS FELIX ADLER'S PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE I FROM discussions of the nature of the good, of virtue and happi- ness, of social welfare and self-interest, and from the im- personal "consensus of moral consciousness," i. e., of respectable opinion rather than of personal feeling and conviction, to be found in our ethical treatises and text-books (of which I also have been guilty), one turns with a certain relief and fresh interest to such a book as Felix Adler's An Ethical Philosophy of Life. Here we have "a philosophy of life growing out of the experiences of a life- time:" the philosophy of life of an ethical teacher, lecturer of the Society for Ethical Culture, who takes his calling with a prophetic seriousness, enlightened by philosophy and intensified by a pastoral contact with the more tragic sides of life, and whose resolute free- thinking can not conceal a mind passionately religious. The work is divided into four books, of which the first, consisting of an "Autobiographical Introduction," is possibly the most interest- ing but the least capable of being summarized. I pass by his search for ethical salvation, which beganl in Judaism and took him through Christianity, Emerson, Socialism and "social work" (whose social ideal appears to him to aim at nothing higher than raising all men to the level of a respectable, middle-class Philistinism) and note the reflections embodied in the last chapter, on "My Vocation." He has told us that "one of the leading principles to which I early gave assent, and to which I have ever since adhered as a correct funda- mental insight, is expressed in the statement that every human being is an end per se, worth while on his own account." One of the chief results, however, of a forty years pastorate as ethical teacher has been to give him a strong sense of the inevitable "frustration" which attends more or less all human purposes: frustration, for example, in the married life through bereavement, defective children, or change of character; frustration in self-development, in the diffi- culty of uniting specialist proficiency with breadth of culture and character; frustration, again, in the attempt to find a moral worth 141</page><page sequence="2">142 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY for life under the worst conditions, such as life in the slums. I wonder whether this chapter may not largely explain Mr. Adler's rather dogmatic rejection of happiness; whether, indeed, the quest for happiness is not condemned less because it is ignoble than be- cause it is futile; and whether he would not admit that the attain- ability of happiness, i. e., the possibility of so controlling the condi- tions of existence as to carry out our plans of life, would of itself vindicate the dignity of man. "As viewed empirically," he tells us, however, "the human generations are but accidents of nature, waves on the sea of life, passing shadows. And viewing ourselves in this manner our self-respect goes to pieces. The idea of obliga- tion vanishes. Man's claim to infinite worth is bitterly mocked." Under these conditions the problem for an ethical philosophy is "how to remedy the belittlement of man;" how to affirm his moral worth in spite of his infinitesimal significance as a creature of time and place. II The second book, under the title of "Philosophical Theory," sketches the author's metaphysics. A statement of the ethical mo- tive has prepared us to learn that he began his philosophical think- ing as a disciple of Kant; and though he has long since recanted Kant, it is with reference to Kant that we can best define his general position. In spite of his thoroughgoing criticism of Kant, I should call him still essentially a Kantian, at least to the extent of giving us what Kant would have taught if he had not been the cut-and- dried person that he was, living in a cut-and-dried century. Nor is his criticism of Kant invariably well chosen; when, for example, he attacks the categorical imperative on the ground of a similarity to numerous other imperatives, such as the primitive tabu. Surely Kant, if any one, made clear the distinction between the imperative of reason, which raises the question of self-contradiction, and the force of habit, which raises no questions whatever. To his general criticism, however, that Kant's thinking was vitiated by an abstract intellectualism and a blind reverence for physical science, resulting in an absolutism grotesque and unreal and a so-called respect for man which respected only an abstract prin- ciple, one may cordially assent. Yet it seems to me that Mr. Adler's correction consists precisely in affirming boldly what Kant dared affirm only rather haltingly, namely, the right of the will (as well as of esthetic taste) to rank with the intellect as a final criterion of truth. But we are not to call him a pragmatist. "Exasperation with absolutism does not of itself justify recourse to the opposite extreme [equally exasperating, I presume] of pragmatism." The</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 143 point is rather that "science, the work of the intellect, and art and ethics, spring from a common root, namely, the reality-producing functions." And this means that ultimately all truths, whether scientific or ethical truths, are in some sense a priori. As Mr. Adler prefers to put it, they are "functional finalities;" by which phrase he refers to "the independent part played by our mental constitution in build- ing up experience, and in affording us the conviction of certainty, and of reality." But it seems also that scientific thinking differs from ethical thinking. Scientific method consists in combining part with part; and these parts of the universe stand fast as certainties, whatever we may say about the universe as a whole. This was the meaning of Kant's showing that from the conditioned we can not argue to the unconditioned. In ethics there is no possibility of con- sidering the parts by themselves. No single rule of conduct is ever right in itself. "It takes its ethical quality from the plan of conduct as a whole, and without reference to the whole it is devoid of right- ness." Briefly, it seems, a fact is a fact without regard to any other fact, but no value is a value apart from a system of values. If space permitted I should like to contest this distinction, and to show that what is here affirmed of values is, ultimately at least, also true of facts. Mr. Adler uses the distinction as a basis for showing that, while there is no "intellectual bridge" from the sensible world to the supersensible (not to be confounded with the supernatural of vulgar thought), there is an ethical bridge. In other words, the ontological proof for the existence of God, rightly criticized by Kant from his abstractly intellectual standpoint, becomes on broader grounds valid. Not, indeed, for the individual "God" of the older anthropomorphic type, but for the reality of a spiritual universe, conceived by Mr. Adler as a spiritual society.1 As thus conceived, the spiritual universe expresses the two fundamental demands of all thought, both scientific and ethical: the' demands, namely, of a unity which shall be irreducible to diversity and of a diversity which shall be irreducible to unity; mutually irreducible, yet "jointly" imperative. That this statement of principles leaves us with an irrational duality, Mr. Adler is evidently prepared to admit. Since he holds that, in the last analysis, man is incompetent to explain the universe, he prefers to accept a certain irrationality as, for us at least, inevitable, just as he prefers to face evil rather than make a futile attempt to explain it away. 1 This conception, I should say, is not less anthropomorphic than the older conception, but only more modern and democratic; and one may ask whether a conception of the universe not anthropomorphic could still have a meaning or be true.</page><page sequence="4">144 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY The bearing of this metaphysical principle upon ethical relations is indicated by the fact that, while standing emphatically for the independent worth of each person, the author refuses to call himself an individualist. "Individualism" is for him a term of reprobation. It means that social harmony can be explained as a composition of private interests. Such a unity is forever false. It is equally false to conceive the individual as a product of the social harmony. III Books III and IV give us the ethical implications of this phi- losophy as concerned, respectively, with personal and social prob- lems. 1 must forego the attempt to present the author's ethical views in detail and confine myself to a statement and criticism of the ethical attitude. The statement of ethical principles has already been given by the author (on p. 117), as follows: A. Act as a member of the ethical manifold (the infinite spiritual universe). B. Act so as to achieve uniqueness (complete individualization- the most completely individualized act is the most ethical). C. Act so as to elicit in another the distinctive, unique quality characteristic of him as a fellow-member of the infinite whole. The ethical attitude implied in this formulation suggests again a comparison with Kant. As conceived by Mr. Adler, it is the Kantian attitude with an important difference, which he states by calling his own attitude "positive," the Kantian attitude, of course, "negative." For convenience we may say that two questions con- front us in the attempt to frame an ethical attitude. The first is, What is to be my attitude towards the material conditions of life- in other words, what moral value is to be attributed to sensuous desire ? The second is. What is to be my attitude towards my neigh- bor? To the first Kant seems to reply, No moral value whatever. The satisfaction of material wants yields happiness, but happiness is morally irrelevant. The categorical imperative is a method, one might say, not so much of extracting moral value from material conditions, as of disposing of these conditions-just as the letter- carrier disposes of his letters. indifferent to the message they may contain, and satisfied if he has delivered them correctly. Mr. Adler is likewise indifferent to happiness. At times, indeed, he seems to be hardly less of a rigorist tlhan Kant. In his little book on Mar- riage atnd Divorce he g(es, so far as to say, as I understand him, that it is, not merely unwise but morally wrong, to seek happiness in marriage. But though indifferent to happiness, he is not indiffer-</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 146 ent to the material conditions. The earthly life is not something to be simply disposed of by a rule of duty. It is the s6urce of all spiritual possibilities. The supreme ethical end is the development of the spiritual possibilities of the finite world. And therefore the only truly ethical attitude is that of "a cheerful world-builder," who takes an active and whole-hearted interest in the improvement of material conditions-not with a view to happiness, but for the purpose of assisting and developing his spiritual nature. But what is meant by the spiritual nature? Some light upon this conception is given in the chapter on "The Practical Vocations." The activi- ties of industry, which result in the production of material goods, also affect the development of character and personality. How far industrial efficiency may be achieved pari passu with the develop- ment of personality, and how far it matters, we are not clearly told. But of the two results it is the second, or spiritual, result, which, and which alone, it seems, has ethical value. Such is the significance of the "positive" attitude. The attitude takes a more distinctive and characteristic form in the answer to the second question. How shall I treat my neighbor? Kant and Mr. Adler agree in replying, Above all, reverentially; as a person, valuable in himself; as an end withal and never as a means only. But how is this respect to be expressed? Kant replies, By letting him alone; at most by consulting his comfort and happiness; his moral welfare is none of your business. And here Mr. Adler objects. Simply to leave your neighbor alone is to show, not respect, but indifference. And to consider only his happiness while you reserve for yourself aims higher than happiness-for example (I should say), to credit him only with a demand for justice in a case where, for yourself, you would prefer to be generous-is really to treat him as an inferior. True respect for another is bound to credit him with moral dignity. And therefore I must "act so as to elicit" (according to Principle C) what is best in him. This is the most characteristic feature of Mr. Adler's conception of the ethical attitude. IV And it is at this point-on the implications of "elicitation"-that I take issue. With his criticism of the Kantian attitude I cordially agree. There can be, I should say, no true respect for another which does not involve understanding and sympathy; and no true sympathy which does not credit him with his best. But how to take a sym- pathetic and helpful attitude towards another and yet refrain from trespassing upon his moral freedom-this is a most difficult question. Kant removes the difficulty by dispensing with the sympathy and</page><page sequence="6">146 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY helpfulness on behalf of freedom. Mr. Adler, I should say, dis- penses with freedom. In thus laying the burden of emphasis upon 'elicitation," it seems to me that Mr. Adler abandons for the time being the principle of personal worth in favor of the more popular ethics of the brother's keeper and the good example. I might urge here the natural bias of one whose vocation of ethical teacher commits him to elicitation, but from this I am spared by remembering that the identification of the moral with the didactic attitude is a trait almost universally American. Among us, it seems that an indispensable mark of a "moral" person is that he "exercises a moral influence." In the older Puritan days, not yet completely past, he was obliged to show a righteous indignation against the evil-doers. The sole evidence of having a conscience of one's own, it appears, is a disposition to direct the consciences of others. It would be very interesting to ask how much of our moral code is made for the use of others. Who is not familiar with the idea that "it would be all right for you and me, but it would never do for the masses"? Or with the fear that a con- cession to personal freedom, not otherwise unreasonable, would be "liable to abuse."2 This rather distrustful anxiety for the souls of others Mr. Adler would extend to one's wife. According to him, the only ethical motive for marriage is the mutual elicitation of moral qualities; never, it seems, the enjoyment of companionship. I agree with Mr. Adler in thinking that Kant's conception of marriage, as a mutual contract to furnish sexual intercourse, is rather horrible, but I should like to ask whether one who made an offer of marriage in Mr. Adler's terms would not be rightly rejected as a prig. If elicitation of moral qualities means simply that it is my duty in an important crisis to lay before another (preferably a friend) the consequences of the alternatives confronting him and the signif- 2 In Marriage and Divorce one of the grounds upon which Mr. Adler opposes all divorce is the following: "Moreover, if divorce is granted in the first instance, it can not be refused in the second instance or in the third; and there follow such scandalous performances as those with reports of which the newspapers have of late entertained or horrified the reading public." But, I ask, Let it be so; what difference does it make to you or me? We are not obliged to associate with such persons. It may also be seriously asked how much of the vileness and indignity associated with "scandalous performances" does not lie in just the fact that they are exploited in the newspapers. Let us remember that legitimate marriage would be made vile if similarly exploited. And the further question arises, What if those who used freedom of divorce as an opportunity, say, for an annual remating turned out to be otherwise worthy persons? I do not fear that myself. But, as an honest inquirer, have I any right to fear it? Precisely such a test is needed, I should say, to answer the question whether permanent fidelity is a sine qua non of moral character or a mere convention.</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 147 icance of his choice as a revelation of himself, well and good. A morally worthy and responsible person is bound to be hospitable to such elicitation as long as it promises to be helpful and enlightening. But when I undertake to dictate his choice, it seems idle to claim that I still recognize the principle of personal dignity and worth. Mr. Adler would go as far as this, and further. If science should ever be able to show that "the union of certain character-types will lead to an infelicitous marriage"-which, fortunately for the whole phi- losophy of personality, he doubts- "the state will be justified in prohibiting such unions."3 In Appendix II., treating of the exer- cise of force, he is ready to employ force, not merely to protect one's own personality from invasion, but to direct the development of personality in others. This forceful moulding of (the other's) char- acter is warranted by "the positive conception of freedom." Alas, that words should play such tricks with us! Would it not be better to say that where we recognize the necessity of restraining others, we admit a difficulty in the way of personal worth as a sole universal ethical principle? Intimately connected with the ethical question of what it means to treat my neighbor as a person is the psychological question of what constitutes a person. And upon this point Mr. Adler is far from clear-not unnaturally, since the question is one of great diffi- culty. It is to be noted, however, that he justifies the coercion of one person by another by assuming, as if beyond question, that within the individual life one desire may coerce another. And this justi- fication is fortified by an "instrumental" conception of the personal life according to which some, if not all, of the parts of one's life are to be treated as mere instruments, or means, to a supreme end. This conception of "instrumentality" pervades more or less his whole conception of the ethical attitude. I am to treat another person as an end withal, and never as a means only; myself, however, as an instrument for the ends of society. I am to achieve individuality, but only instrumental individuality. The present generation is to be instrumental to the next. The whole career of the race is to be instrumental to ends that lie in the infinite beyond. Only in the infinite it seems, if even there, may we contemplate the possibility of realization, of satisfaction, of enjoyment; or, if you please, of happiness. Now this identification of personal with purposive activity and of purposive activity with the use of means for ends, is doubtless a common feature of self-realization ethics, which, as against the hedonist's life of happiness, proposes a life organized for an end. 3Pp. 307, 371.</page><page sequence="8">148 TIHE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY I am none the less persuaded that, as a characterization of personal activity, it misses the point. Let it be remembered that to assert the means-to-end principle in morals used to be the distinctive (and opprobrious) mark of the utilitarian. Against him the Intuitionist argued that honesty, for example, was not a means to an end but a good in itself. And this seemed to leave the moral life without coher- ence and in posstble danger of anarchy. Accordingly, the theory of self-realization teaches that honor, chastity and the like, are, not each a good in itself, but connected as features of personal worth; and the moral life is then viewed as a coordinated system of personal activity. But this seems to say that honor is after all only a means to an end; in other words, that self-realization is only a new utili- tarianism, in which, once more, the means are justified by the end, the end, however, the perfection of the person rather than his happi- ness. Such, I should say, is the common way of conceiving self- realization, and it is apparently the conception implied in Mr. Adler's "instrumental" view. This conception overlooks an important difference. Let cooking the dinner be the means, of which eatin( the dinner is (at least the proximate) end. To say that the process of cooking is merely a means signifies that value is realized only in the eating, or in the end. If we could get the cooked dinner without the cooking, so much the better-so much the better, indeed, that nearly all who can afford it prefer to employ a cook. In other words, on the bal- ance-sheet of value, the end alone stands for receipts, the means standing for a necessary and unwelcome expenditure. Now, it is surely not in this sense that honor is conceived as "instrumental" to perfection, or development of character. In no intelligible sense of perfection can one be conceived to desire perfection and yet loathe honor. The point is that the conception of end and means implies that the activities or experiences representing end and means respectively are separable in time. Thus only can they be distinguished as ends or means and the realization of value located in the end. In the development of character means and ends are not thus separable. We attain perfection, let us say, not after we have practised honesty, but in the practise of honesty itself. The end comes, not after the means, but in the means themselves. This suggests, I should say, that for the relation between the several features of a personal activity the distinction of end and means is meaningless. An instrument, in plain words, is a tool. I will then venture the suggestion that the conception of instrumentality is a metaphorical derivation from the use of tools; or, more broadly, that the whole</page><page sequence="9">PSYCIOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 149 scheme of means and ends is built upon an observation of dis- tinctively mechanical activities, involving the use of tools. and the preparation of material. It is here distinctively that ends and means are separated in time-ever more widely as, in modern industry, processes are lengthened and tools become complex ma- chines-and no value is realized short of the end. It is here also that ends and means have the least "organic" relation. It is not necessary that a shoe be made of leather or that leather be made into a shoe; that a man be killed with a knife or that a knife be used only to kill a man. As soon as we pass from mechanical to vital processes the relation is altered. A kitten can develop only into a cat, a cat only from a kitten. So far, however, as the two stages can be given a moral relation, they are not now related as means and end. To say that the child is only a means to the man is true only from the standpoint of "cannon-fodder," or from the hardly less sordid standpoint of a puritanical rigorism, which looks upon life solely as a disciplinary process and upon childhood solely as a training for maturity. It is scarcely humane, I should say, to treat the child merely as a means. But in passing from mechanism to life we are approaching personality. Personality begins, it might be said, with the exercise of foresight and the adaptation of means to ends, as manifested, say, in the use of tools. True, but it only begins here. The pur- chase of ends at the cost of arduous and unwelcome means marks the stage of blind submission to external necessity. The progress of culture stands for nothing more clearly than a revolt against this grinding necessity; and a revolt which is ever, if ever incompletely, successful in reducing the element of necessity. Sympathy with this revolt is part of Mr. Adler's conception of the ethical attitude. In his view extreme poverty is morally degrading; not because the poor must work and encounter hardship, but because their choices are ever bound by necessity. And modern machine-industry also tends to degrade, because, in dissociating the means so widely from the end, and in associating the worker solely with the means, it makes a tool of the worker himself; because, in other words, his work stands for so little of choice and reflection and for so much of habit and necessity. Here it seems that the instrumental ideal is repugnant to himself. But how is the element of necessity to be reduced? This is not a simple question, but two points may be noted: (1) In the revolt against the burden of cooking for the sake of eating, I summon my intelligence to the task of reducing the burden by making the process easier and simpler. (2) But the very exercise of intelli-</page><page sequence="10">150 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY gence works a change in the character of the task. Along with the saving of labor, cooking becomes an interesting, at least a challeng- ing problem, more or less worth while in itself, thereby less a work of labor and more a work of art. It becomes a "personal" activity. I doubt if Mr. Adler would reject this element from the solution. Let me, however, enumerate some of the implications: (1) In a life governed by the principle of personality no part of life may be a mere means. As a person I insist that every part of life has a worth in itself; every part must also be an end. (2) No desire can be regarded as subordinate to other desires or subject to their coercion: every part of our nature has its rights. (3) And the ideal of life is not mere striving, but also realization-fruition-enjoy- ment; that is to say, it includes, among other considerations, the rejected consideration of happiness. As a further illustration of the instrumental motive I may cite Mr. Adler's suggestion for an ideal state: namely, that the state be organized on the basis of vocational groups as a league, or society, of guilds. To me this savors strongly of that German-made state which we are now commanded to detest, and against which, just as a person, I feel called upon to protest.' This emphasis upon the vocational motive is another mark of the self-realization theory, which, in setting up against the hedonistic ideal of pleasure or happiness the ideal of "work," tends to make the profession or "career" the chief, if not the sole expression of the person. As a corrective to self-indulgence it has its uses. As a definition of the person it strikes me as narrow, utilitarian, and in a certain measure degrading. As a person I can not consent that my vocation of stu- dent and teacher of philosophy shall rule as the determining or dominating motive of my life. I can recognize no moral obliga- tion to prefer philosophers as my friends, to prefer philosophical to other and often more enlivening reading, to listen to a Beethoven symphony from a philosophical point of view, or to look upon my children with the eyes of a philosophical parent. I admit that, in point of fact, I shall be bound to make my profession a matter of chief importance. But bound by what? Again, I should say, by necessity: partly, indeed, by the necessity of earning a living, but no less by the necessity of accepting the conditions offered by the exist- ing organization of society if I am to be personally effective. Those conditions are not more likely to fit my person than a ready-made coat. Even the academic distinctions of philosopher, historian, biologist, chemist, and the like stand less for personal and logical distinctions of problem and task than for a convenient arrangement of academic fences. In brief, the society of guilds may be an</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 151 excellent political arrangement for the transaction of business; it is not a unity of persons. These mark the points at which, I should say, Mr. Adler has not quite succeeded in his "joint" method of driving two horses abreast. His two horses are personality and social harmony. It seems to me that an unconscious deference to popular conceptions of social morality-of the kind already deprecated in his criticism of socialism-has led him to drive the social horse ahead of the per- sonal. But it is not to be expected that any of us will succeed in driving two horses abreast; nor, I fear, that any of us will succeed in driving his philosophical chariot with less than two horses. The criticisms touch the book only in certain aspects. The book as a whole is an impressive presentation of an ethical attitude, and the attitude is marked by nobility of conception, by spiritual insight into the souls of men, and at the same time by a fairly resolute recognition of the facts of life.
