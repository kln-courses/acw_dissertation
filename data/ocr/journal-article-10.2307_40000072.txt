<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mehen, Mysteries, and Resurrection from the Coiled Serpent Peter A. Piccione* The Mysteries of Mehen In Egyptian literature, the "mysteries of Me- hen" are referred to only once by name, i.e., in the Coffin Texts, and there with only very little identifying context. However, this reference is important because it is the first visible indication of a relationship between the god Mehen and recondite knowledge in Egyptian theological thought. The primary function of the god Mehen in religious belief is depicted in the New Kingdom netherworld literature. According to the Book of Amduat, the Book of Gates, and the Book of Night, Mehen ostensibly is an immense coiled serpent who stands on the night-bark of Ra, and he guides the passage of the sun-god in his netherworld journey. Primarily, though, he en- compasses Ra in his many coils, and protects him from all outside evil.1 Because of the esoteric nature of these mortu- ary texts and the fact that the representations of these books had a self-acknowledged mysterious character, we understand that Mehen's specific role, as exemplified within them, shared this character and was also kept as a secret. Few Egyptologists would disagree that knowledge of these texts and their representations was im- parted to the Egyptian cognoscenti through some elaborate and dramatic rite of initiation, although many would differ about the exact nature of any initiation ritual and the extent to which it affected the personal identification of the initiate. It is in these contexts that we see Mehen fully and obviously associated with mysterious be- havior and secret knowledge, albeit only as a small element in a larger mystery. However, the fact that more formalized mysteries specifically centering around this peculiar deity did exist is indicated in Coffin Text Spells 493 and 495,2 where the deceased says: iw bj.i n dt.f iw swy.t.i n c.s ink pw mk n hbn.tyw m-ht stlw Mhn My soul belongs to its body; my shadow belongs to its condition. I am the guard of the criminals after (the manner of) the mysteries of Mehen.3 The stSw mhn, "mysteries of Mehen," are identi- fied with very little context or explanation; yet by their mention here, they appear to be a formalized set of rituals and beliefs related to the serpent-deity. This conclusion is based upon the general nature of stBzv, "mysteries," not as dogma or creed but rather, similarly to Bleeker, * A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the annual conference of the American Research Center in Egypt, April 1989, in Philadelphia.

Other secret knowledge related to Mehen, which may be part of the more formalized mysteries, is found in the series of Coffin Text Spells 758-760.6 Presently, the only known copy of these is inscribed on the headboard of the outer coffin of the imy-r msc Spi (Sepi III) from his Middle Kingdom tomb at el-Bersha, now loca- ted in the Cairo Museum, CG no. 28083. 7 How- ever, since a portion of Spells 758-759 did descend into the New Kingdom Book of the Dead, Chapter 131, then we would assume that these spells enjoyed a somewhat wider distribu- tion than that which their one extant example would otherwise suggest.8 These spells depict a realm of the afterlife in which the bark of Mehen encircles nine concen- tric roads, four of which are specifically roads of fire, which it circumnavigates for millions of years. In the vignette of the spell, the four roads of fire are depicted in red paint, and they alter- nate with five black roads (fig. I).9 According to the texts, upon these roads of Mehen are "gates that turn away" (sbBw stnmw).10 The sun god, Ra,11 sits at the center of these roads on his throne of ' 'millions of years," and he guards the gates of the roads.12 On his head he is depicted wearing a crown reminiscent of an Stf, although its constituent parts are formed by the heads and bodies of serpents. The brim of the crown is formed by a serpent with a head at both ends of its body, probably to be understood as Mehen.13 According to the spells, just as the fiery roads protect the adjacent sides of Mehen's bark, so the starboard side of the bark also protects the roadways. The deceased is identified as Wrd prw m ir.t, "the Weary one who came forth from the eye," and he is also described as one who has created the protective fire around Mehen. The text of CT Spell 758 is inscribed within a wide oval that entirely encircles the roads, which Zan- dee has conjectured is specifically a representa- tion of Mehen himself,14 although certainly there are no other features which would support such an identification. It is clear though that the object of the deceased here is to approach Ra at the center and not to be kept off by the dangers of the roads. Spell 759 reveals the name of these fiery roads, and they are specifically the wSw.t mhn, the "Roads of Mehen":15 iw.i rh.kwi hftyw.f imyw sbhw.t is iw rh.n.i wSw.t [Mhri\ I am acquainted with his enemies which are in the gates.

Similarly, in the very first line of Spell 759, the deceased must identify the specific serpent-deity involved: ir wnnt Mhn pwy pw n Rc Now as for this Mehen, he is (that) of Ra.17 In order to enter the roads and presumably approach Ra, the deceased must "know" the roads and their name, so Spell 760 says: ir rh rn n wSw.t.f iptn swt pw ck r Mhn ir rh r pn n sk.n.f dt cnh.f m cnh.t Rc As for the one who knows the name of those his roads, it is he who will enter Mehen. As for the one who knows this spell, he does not perish forever; he will live on that which Ra lives.18 Therefore, this series of spells discloses informa- tion related to Mehen that, otherwise, is not of general knowledge in the hereafter. The three passages indicate specifically the revelatory na- ture of Spells 758-760.

It consists of the enthroned Ra, the "Roads of Mehen" and their gateways, as well as the gods located in them. The spells indicate that Mehen not only sails the fiery roads, but that he is the roadway itself, spiralling inward toward Ra at the center. The Coiled- Serpent Game Remarkably, the description and layout of the "Circuit of Ra" with its "Roads of Mehen" are nearly identical in form to the earlier Old King- dom board game, likewise named mhn, i.e., the game of the coiled serpent (fig. 2). Typically, the squares of this game are laid atop the slotted spine of a coiled mhn-snake. Examples of this gameboard and its accoutre- ments have been found throughout Egypt dating from the Predynastic Period through the Old Kingdom. Its play has been depicted on the walls of Old Kingdom mastabas, along with other games and recreation, as part of festive rites of Hathor which were celebrated in honor of the deceased tomb owner.20 In 1920, Hermann Ranke made his seminal study of the mhn- game,21 and since that work, the game has continued to be studied by others, although only as it has related to other research.22 Some thirteen or more examples of the mhn -board are cur- rently extant. According to a two-dimensional representation in the tomb of Hesyre at Saqqara, the appurtenances of the game consisted of 6 sets of colored marbles, 6 marbles per set, and Fig. 3.

On the basis of its similarity to other mhn- boards of the Old Kingdom and its fine style of execution, a dating to the Old Kingdom like- wise seems appropriate for it. OIM gameboard no. 16950 is typical of mhn- boards. It is circular in shape, carved from a single piece of alabaster, 38 cm. in diameter, 4.5 cm. thick.

Apparently, the direction of rotation was not significant, since nearly equal numbers of surviving boards show the serpent coiling in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions.25 The board con- tains 127 squares arranged into four spirals. Here also the number of squares on the board was not standardized; as in the corpus of mhn- boards, this number ranges from as little as twenty-nine to as many as nearly 400 squares on a single board.26 Similar to a limited number of m/m-boards, OIM 16950 depicts a second head, that of a duck or goose, emanating from the tail of the serpent on the outside of the board.27 A heavy residue of brown pigment in the pores of the stone and between the game-squares indi- cates that at one time, it was thickly plied with brown paint, probably to emulate the natural coloration of the serpent which the board represented. Based upon what we know of this game in the work of Ranke and others, the feline game- pieces moved in a spiral along the squares, apparently, from the tail on the outside to the head of the serpent at the center, according to rules which are not precisely understood today.28 What is clear, though, is that on gameboard OIM 16950, the paint is still thickly applied to the cross -slots between the squares, while in the longer spiralling grooves, it is worn thinly and smoothly, suggesting that some small object regularly rolled or passed through the spiral to achieve this wear. This conclusion would sup- port the assertions of Klebs and others,29 against Quibell, that the marbles were actually utilized on the board and in the spiral, along with the feline draughtsmen. According to the appearance of the mhn- game in the archaeological and artistic records, it is clear that it was in popular use from the Predynastic Period through the Old Kingdom, along with the board games of mn and zn.t. It is depicted very early with these two games as part of the mortuary accoutrements of Hesyre in his mastaba of the Third Dynasty and in an offering list of Rahotep in his Fourth Dynasty mastaba at Medum.30 Thereafter, based upon a sudden and complete dearth of evidence for the mhn- game after the fall of the Old Kingdom, both in the archaeological and artistic records, we con- clude that it fell into rapid disuse, probably a victim of the social disorders and disruptions of the First Intermediate Period. There is no evi- dence to suggest that after that time, the game was played again in Egypt. However in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, after a hiatus of nearly two millennia, the Egyptians did resume depict- ing the play of that game on the walls of their tombs. This development was part of the so- called neo-Memphite revival, when Old King- dom artistic motives were applied to later art forms.31 Still, there is no evidence in the archaeo- logical record to indicate that the game was remanufactured and played at that time. After this brief and final reappearance in the artistic record, the game of mhn passed entirely from Egyptian custom. A Religious Context for the M/m-game As a parallel to the Old Kingdom game of mhn, the wEw.t Mhn, "Roads of Mehen," in the Coffin Texts were formed by concentric circles; and just as the draughtsmen spiralled around the gameboard toward the center, so the de- ceased, according to CT Spells 758-760, likewise traveled in a spiralling direction in order to approach Ra enthroned at the center of the roads. Just as the track of the ra/m-gameboard was segmented with individual squares, so the "Roads of Mehen" were also broken up incre- mentally by gateways through which the de- ceased had to pass and which otherwise had the 25 Hoerth, "Gameboards," 99, 104-6. 26 Similarly, ibid., 103. 27 So also Ranke, Schlangenspiel, 7 and n. 5, although he was unable to identify the species of bird. 28 Q.v.

There is no doubt that the coiled m/m-serpent, which gave its name to that Old Kingdom gameboard, was identical to the deity properly named Mehen - this same deity who otherwise personified the circular road- way in the Coffin Texts and who similarly lent his name to those roads.32 It is apparent then that either the m hn -gameboard was the basis on which the "Roads of Mehen" were conceived in the afterlife or that both the gameboard and the "Roads of Mehen" originated in the same well- spring of Egyptian religious thought. A parallel for the assimilation of the mhn- game and afterlife roadway occurs even earlier than that indicated in the Coffin Texts, i.e., during the Old Kingdom - although in a slightly different context, for certainly in Pyramid Text Utt. 332, §541, the deceased king comes forth from a m hn -gameboard during his ascension into heaven: dd mdw N. pw nw pr m mhn pr.n N. m hh.f inny zb.n N. ptwy iy.n N. tSwy Recitation: It is this N. who has come forth from the m hn -board. When he came around, N. came forth from its fiery breath. Just as N. has traveled (to) the two skies, so N. has returned (to) the two lands.33 This passage describes the circular direction of travel on the board, as well as exiting on the breath of the snake. Kurt Sethe understood the text in a similar manner.34 Furthermore, he interpreted the m/m-game in this and similar contexts as some kind of ordeal or legal trial for the deceased.35 Faulkner, on the other hand, contended that mhn in this text referred only to the proper name of the serpent-deity, not spe- cifically to the gameboard, and that the de- ceased's action was one of "escape" from the snake.36 However, Sethe would appear correct in this context. Mehen is both gameboard and serpent. While the king is conceived of as "coming forth" from that board, he is, at the same time, understood as being reborn in a blast of the serpent's breath. The entire action functions less as a matter of "escape" than as a stage in the process of ascension. The dual notion of Mehen as gameboard and snake from whose fiery breath the deceased is reborn is expressed more clearly in PT Utt. 758, inscribed in the pyramid of Queen Neith.37 It is addressed to a serpent-deity named nb jht, "Lord of the Horizon": iwr N.t m fnd ms N.t p(w) m msd.t sdr N.t m kjb.(t).k hms N.t m mhn.k Neith is conceived in the nose. This is how Neith is born in the nostril. Just as Neith rests in your coils, so Neith sits in (i.e., "resides in") your m/m-board.38 This entire passage refers to the birth of Queen Neith into the afterlife from the breath and nostrils of the serpent. Residing within the coils of the serpent is synonymous with being upon the ra/m- gameboard, and is part of the resurrec- tion process. For the same reason in PT Utt. 659, the deceased king is exhorted to move his pieces around a ra/zn-board in the context of his own deification: szp n.k ibhw.k ipw hdw m Mhnw psrw hj.sn m ssr m rn.sn pw n ssr Take for yourself these your white ivory pieces (lit.

The face of Neith is in the ra/m-board of (this) Shesmu.'41 The deceased's presence upon the ra/m-board is associated with her divine transformation and ascension. The reading of this text differs from that of Leclant in his study of PT Utt. 626.42 While the relation of Shesmu to the ra/m-board remains unclear, Leclant' s arguments to associ- ate that deity with the board are not persuasive, based as they are on the outdated notion that the mhn -board originally represented not a coiled serpent, but a pitfall, i.e., a trap used to snare animals.43 However, Quibell and Ranke long ago demonstrated the mhn -board's original con- nection to the coiled serpent, an identification that still remains firm despite any assertions to the contrary.44 Leclant argues that Shesmu's dual nature as a deity of the oil and wine press, as well as a butcher of the enemies of the god, is appropriate for this passage. However, his asser- tion is unacceptable that the mhn -board through which the queen passes is actually Shesmu's trap to crush her head. Such a notion, replete with danger for the deceased, is wholly inappro- priate to the spell, which otherwise promotes the ascension and spiritual transformation of the dead queen. Similar to its appearance in the Pyramid Texts, in the Book of the Two Ways the mhn- board facilitates the transition to resurrection. So CT 1103 asks the question: inm phr.f mhn cd sch.f wdc-mdw Dhwty m nhpw Who will travel around the ra/m-board, whose rank is great, whom Thoth will judge in the early morning?45 Sethe's notion that divine judgment is exempli- fied in the successful transit of the gameboard is consistent with Thoth's role here as a judge of the individual who goes around and through the board. Therefore, similar to Sethe's conclu- sion, both PT Utt. 332 and CT 1103 would define the ra/m-board as a place of ordeal in the life of the deceased, leading to final judgment by the god and hence, eternal life. Journeying across the ra/m-board is tantamount in theory to traveling through the serpent, while exiting the board denotes rebirth from the body of the snake. This interpretation differs from that of Ranke, who earlier had construed the ra/m-game as a struggle between the deceased player and the ra/m-serpent itself. He suggested that the goal of the game was to kill the serpent by dismember- ment, as indicated by the slotting of the spine,46 and to remove its fangs, which he argued were detrimental to the deceased.47 However, this in- terpretation is vitiated by the function of the ra/m-serpent/gameboard in the Pyramid Texts and by the beneficial and protective role of the god Mehen in the resurrection process, as we stated at the beginning of this study. Hence, Mehen should be construed as the mentor of the player, not his opponent. The notion of the god's birth from a serpent in his cycle of resurrection was not lost on the Egyptians even later in the New Kingdom. It is a concept that finds expression throughout the Book of Amduat, so e.g.: the Fifth Hour, in which Sokar is born from the back of a three- headed winged serpent during the course of the 41 PT §2265a, Jequier, Pyramides des reines Neit et Apouit, pl. 8, col. 6 (p. 26 for the correct reading of szmw); Faulkner, Pyr., Supplement, 80 (szmw uncorrected); J.

Hence, it is consistent with the ibhw hdw, "white ivory pieces," associated with the m/zn-game of PT Utt. 659, mentioned earlier. While Ritner interprets tpy[w], "heads," also to mean the gaming pieces of the board, we are apt to understand it more literally.57 This ref- erence to the heads of Mehen is very telling, since as we have already noted, many mhn- gameboards depict the serpent with two different heads: the serpent-head at the center of the spiral and a bird's head projecting from the tail of the snake on the outside. The play on the gameboard then is identical to the movement through the serpent cnh-ntrw, as described in Amduat, Twelfth Hour. The game-pieces, enter- ing the board through the outer rank of squares could be conceived as being swallowed by the duck-head emanating from the tail, after which the pieces would travel through the body of the serpent and exit the board via the head. As a parallel to BD 172, the notion that Mehen had two heads is found in other New Kingdom texts. The Book of Gates, Tenth Divi- sion, depicts six uraei seated on two bows; standing between them is an anthropomorphic deity with two heads, those of Horus and Seth.58 The figure is named, Mhn pj n icrw. (t) hrwy.fy, "It is Mehen of the Uraei- His Two Faces,"59 and he occurs in a group of scenes that describes the regeneration of the sun god as a child.60 The accompanying text says: Mhn pw n icrw.t hns.f dwj.t smrw.t rmn.sn hrwy.f(y) m stj.f It is Mehen of the Uraei, he travels through the netherworld. The bows, they lift up His Two Faces as his mystery.61 Thus, the figure depicts the god Mehen, in whom the conceptualization with two heads clearly appears as a secret form (ra stj.f).62 Another parallel for the double-headed aspect of Mehen is found in the Book of Day, wherein 48 Hornung, Amduat, vol. 1, 94, 7-8 (394); vol. 2, 106. 49 Ibid., vol. 1, 181, 2-4 (755/756); vol. 2, 175. 50 Ibid., vol. 1, 197, 7-12; vol. 2, 188-89. 51 Cf.

As noted earlier in regard to CT Spell 658, the crown of Ra within the Roads of Mehen depicts a single snake with a head at both ends of its body. Based upon what we understand about Mehen, this representation very probably depicts him in his hidden aspect. Thus, it would appear that in his secret form, Mehen has two heads, which according to the Book of Gates are mani- fested as Horus and Seth, and it is this mysteri- ous aspect of him to which BD 172 refers when it mentions "the heads of Mehen wherein the two lords played." As Horus and Seth are conceived as playing within the two heads of Mehen, they are under- stood as being inside the body of the serpent. We cannot help but notice in BD 172 that the imagery of the two gods playing a game inside the body or circuit of the m/m-serpent conjures up a clear image of the play of the Old Kingdom m/zn-game, in which the players' pieces likewise travel within the circle of a serpentine game- board.64 This notion is especially cogent in light of PT Utt. 758, whereby the very act of residing within the serpent's coil is analogous to being upon the ra/zn-board, and in light of PT Utt. 626, in which the head of the deceased travels through the gameboard. BD 172 would then represent a New Kingdom allusion to the Old Kingdom game of mhn, which indicates that millennia later, the Egyptians had not entirely forgotten the older religious associations of the m/zn-game, even though that game had long fallen into disuse. Field Museum Object no. 31009 This lingering memory of the ra/m-game in the New Kingdom and its religious associations with the god Mehen are almost certainly reflected in a rare object now in the collection of the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, no. 31009 (fig. 4).65 This piece represents a large coiled serpent which repeats the physical pattern of the Old Kingdom m/m-game. However, un- like the earlier gameboards, it is made of a dark blue faience, which by the color and style of its glaze appears characteristic of the New King- dom.66 It was originally purchased in Egypt as part of an ensemble with two other serpent- amulets in June 1895 by Mr. Edward Ayer, who donated it to the museum's collections. No provenience is recorded.67 Physically, the serpent lies coiled on a circular base which is 25 cm. in diameter and 1-2 cm. thick. The body of the snake is fully formed. Its spine is rounded, not flat like the true mhn- board, nor is it slotted and delineated with game- squares like the latter. The tubular body is up to 1.2 cm. in height, and the spiralling gaps between the volutions consist of deeply rounded grooves. Black paint is thickly applied Fig. 4.

The eyes and mouth are modelled and outlined in black paint. While the body of the serpent is molded to the base, the head is fully three-dimensional and stands erect above the surface. Significantly, the serpent coils in a counter-clockwise direction, with the head on the outside and the tail inside, which is opposite to the traditional orientation of ra/m-gameboards. The museum fiche describes the object as ''part of game with amuletic signifi- cance." Clearly the piece is a votive object, almost certainly for the god Mehen. However, it is not a gameboard. Despite key differences between FM 31009 and the mhn -board, e.g., the orientation of the head, contour of the body, and lack of game-squares, it seems evident that FM 31009, while manu- factured in the New Kingdom, was inspired by at least a memory - however faulty - of the earlier m hn -gameboard. Therefore in keeping with the role of Mehen and the game's sym- bolism, this votive object and any others like it would have promoted the resurrection of the deceased and facilitated rebirth through the body of the serpent. In conclusion we note the following: the m/m-game was understood as a means of trans- formation to rebirth through a process of jour- ney. In the Pyramid Texts, this was to journey across the board and through the serpent in order to issue forth reborn in a blast from the serpent's nostrils. Later in the Coffin Texts, this notion was reinterpreted as to journey within the context of the "circuit of Ra," which prob- ably was conceptualized from the pre-existing mhn -gameboard. By the new Kingdom, the lin- gering memory of the gameboard, in conjunc- tion with notions of rebirth from the serpent, fostered the development of mhn-style amulets to facilitate the transition to resurrection. At the same time, the memory of the ra/m-game was associated with the mysterious two-headed aspect of Mehen that was otherwise related to the birth of the sun god. This aspect of his was not generally promulgated but was kept m stj.f, "as his secret," i.e., only for those who were in the know, and it was thus, perhaps, part of the "mysteries of Mehen."
