<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BULLETIN OF Cl, THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART J TH ANNIVERSARY YEAR IN TWO PARTS THIRTY-EIGHTH YEAR JUNE, 1951 NUMBER SIX: PART TWO REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1950 WILLIAM M. MILLIKEN, Director The attendance during the year 1950 was 475,523, the third largest number in the history of the Museum, only the great snow of late November with its week-long paralysis of trans portation having kept the total from equaling or surpassing that of the previous year. The year was greatly saddened by the death of Mrs. B. P. Bole, a Trustee Emeritus, who for long years had been keenly interested in every phase of the Museum's activities. A Memo rial Membership Endowment Fund in her name was established by gifts from her family and friends. Mrs. E. S. Harkness, a valued member of the Advisory Council, also passed away, on May 6. Her many generous gifts of lace created a memorial to Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness. Seven new Membership Endowment Funds were established and placed upon the records of the Museum: the Anonymous No. 2 Fund, the Salmon P. Halle Memorial, the Lawrence Hitchcock Memorial, the Lewis A. McCreary Memorial, the Harry DeWeese Norvell Memorial, the Crispin Oglebay Memorial, and the Whitney Warner Memorial. In addition, two Contributing Membership Endowment Funds were established: an Anonymous Fund and the Mrs. George M. Humphrey Fund. This brings the number of Membership Endowment Funds to 67 and the Contributing Membership Endowment Funds to 17. The total membership is 4,408, a gain of 222 over the previous year's. The Museum is very grateful to its members, of whom over one thousand are Life Members. Today no effort is being made to increase this class, because the low rate of income on invested funds in which life membership payments are placed does not pay for the privileges granted the members. For this reason, many life members who have understood the situation ISI</page><page sequence="2">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART have most generously resumed giving annually and, in some cases, have established small endowment funds. A new class, Special Life of $500.0o, has been created and includes both husband and wife. Memberships of that size would be of ma terial aid. The Norman 0. Stone and Ella A. Stone Memorial Fund of I,00o000.00, bequeathed under the Will of Ella A. Stone and subject to a life interest, now terminated, was established as a purchase fund as indicated by the donor. Three new Building and Endowment Funds, added to the eight already upon the books, bring the grand total to $I,206, 382.22, an increase of $598,959.55 in one year. This spectacular increase, the greatest since the first fund was established, was in large part due to the receipt of $415,989.83 from the Trustees of the Grace Rainey Rogers Trust. This has provided a great acceleration in the search for funds for a future addition to the building. Many of the donors who have given in the past for this purpose have spread their gifts over the years, and through these annual donations, the funds have now reached this large total. The necessity for an addition is evident to everyone, and the inclusion of the word "endowment" in the title of the funds emphasizes the fact that if a new building is built, there must be income as well with which to maintain it adequately. Pur chase funds are one of the things which have made the Museum what it is, but they in themselves increase the responsibilities of the Museum. Unrestricted endowment is the greatest single need. The publications of the Museum are reaching out and making the Museum known to an ever-widening circle throughout the world. The catalogues of the Henry G. Keller Memorial Exhi bition and the William Sommer Memorial Exhibition were published during the year, recording most effectively the cre ative spirit of these outstanding Cleveland artists. Through publications sent in exchange for such catalogues, the Museum Library receives a steady stream of most valuable material. Several color prints of paintings were added to the series al ready for sale and have proven very popular. The Junior Council has greatly broadened the circle of the Museum's friends. Familiar as its members are with the aims, ideals, and program of the Museum, they have interested many 152</page><page sequence="3">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR in its services. They are most valued advance agents for special events. With the Cleveland News as co-sponsor, they have made the Christmas Community Carol Service a moment of unfor gettable effectiveness. Mrs. Reed Rowley, the Chairman of the Council, has been tireless in her efforts for co-operation. The Lake View Cemetery Association again graciously presented the large Christmas tree in front of the Museum, which be comes the focal point of the vista from the Fine Arts Garden and adds much to the beauty of the Museum in the Christmas season. The year was the single greatest one in the accessions for the Painting Department. The generous gift of funds from Hanna Fund made possible eight brilliant accessions. Three were in the modern field, each an outstanding example of work by Berthe Morisot, ]douard Vuillard, and Georges Rouault; the others were in the realm of old masters. A panel by Albrecht Altdorfer represents admirably this rare German master, while the "Portrait of a Young Student," a late Rembrandt, is that artist at his best. This canvas was given to the Metropolitan Opera Association in memory of Mr. and Mrs. Otto Kahn by their children, and sold by their instruction for the benefit of new productions there. It is a profound and beautiful picture, which supplements admirably the two early Rembrandts al ready in the Museum's collection. The three remaining pictures, all masterpieces, were Venetian canvases of the High Renais sance: a portrait by Lorenzo Lotto; the wonderfully composed "Annunciation" by Veronese; and the Tintoretto, "Baptism of Christ," from the Arthur Sachs Collection, which is truly spectacular in its brilliant and sparkling color. With these paintings acquired during the year, the Titian portrait of the "Prelate," purchased through the Mr. and Mrs. William H. Marlatt Fund several years ago, was shown for the first time in February, I95I, as a part of the celebration of the Museum's Thirty-Fifth Anniversary. From Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., personally, came a canvas by James Ensor and one by Rufino Tamayo; from Harry D. Kendrick, a fine "Head of a Woman" by Renoir; from Edward B. Greene, for his Collection, a beautiful Malbone miniature. The fine "Portrait of Benjamin Rouse" by John Wesley Jarvis was bequeathed most generously by Adella Prentiss Hughes. I53</page><page sequence="4">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART A pastel by James N. Rosenberg, a water color by John Marin, and two pictures by William Sommer from the Sommer Memo rial Exhibition were secured for the American section through the Norman 0. Stone and Ella A. Stone Memorial Fund. Paint ings by the Cleveland artists, Dean Ellis, Leroy Flint, E. Bart Gerald, Alice M. Gizewski, Richard Gosminski, Joan Kemp smith, Shirley Kravitz, and Emma Yarlekovic, were acquired from the May Show by the Cleveland Traveling Exhibitions and the Silver Jubilee Treasure Funds. Through the courtesy of the Errer Corporation, from the Collections of the Barons Alain and Eli de Rothschild, the Museum was fortunate to be able to show, on a long-time loan, three all-important Rembrandts and "The Jester with a Lute" by Frans Hals. These pictures, hung in the Armor Court with the Museum's Rembrandts and the Hals, make an unfor gettable ensemble. The "Temptation of St. Anthony" by Hieronymus Bosch was graciously lent by Walter Bareiss. The acquisitions of the Print Department were extremely important. Nineteen hundred and fifty vied with the record breaking year of 1949 in the importance of the prints and draw ings acquired. The dispersal of great princely collections after the last war made possible the purchase of: a superlative wood cut of the Emperor Maximilian I, an equestrian portrait on a blue ground that is a unique impression in unparalleled condi tion; and, among the great rarities, two chiaroscuros and a woodcut by Hans Wechtlin, and an engraving by Mair von Landshut, all from the Prince Liechtenstein Collection. From the Collection of Friedrich August II, King of Saxony, came the greatest single print by Master E. S., a design for a paten, in its first state, of which only five impressions are known to Lehrs. All of these purchases were made through the John L. Severance Fund. An anonymous, fifteenth-century dotted print was purchased through the Dudley P. Allen Fund, as was a set of soft-ground etchings by Thomas Girtin; an etching by Bellange; and a group of forty lithographs and one drypoint by Toulouse Lautrec, which build up materially the Museum's work by this artist. As a gift from The Print Club comes a group of pieces: an engraving by Georg Pencz; four etchings by Wenzel Hollar; I54</page><page sequence="5">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR and a lithograph by Pissarro, all presented in memory of Mrs. Ralph King. The Print Club gave as well a group of Orozco lithographs and a series of modern prints; the preparatory drawings, prints, and blocks for The Print Club publication; and a group of prints by Cleveland artists. Mr. and Mrs. Lewis B. Williams have consistently developed the collection which bears their name. This year thirty-two engravings by Hans Sebald Beham and seven lithographs by Eugene Isabey were added. Two Nanteuils were the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Richard H. Zinser. Additions were made to the Mary Spedding Milliken Memorial Collection and the H. Oothout Milliken Memorial Collection; a Daumier proof and a rare woodcut by Lepdre, the latter one of four proofs, were added to the Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Prasse Collection. Particularly important were the gifts of Harry D. Kendrick. They include "The Delphian Sibyl," which is an anonymous Florentine fifteenth-century print formerly in the Friedrich August II Collection; two exquisite impressions of engravings by Diirer; and a drawing by Jean-Baptiste Isabey, a master piece in its field, representing Barbier Valbonne. Other gifts came from Grover Higgins, Mrs. Donald Gray, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sayles Francis, Guy Mayer, Louis D. Elliott, Mrs. Rudolph Stanley-Brown, William G. Mather, and others. Purchases of several very significant drawings were made through the Norman O. Stone and Ella A. Stone Memorial Fund: they were four drawings by John Singleton Copley, two by Charles E. Burchfield, and modern Italian drawings by Corrado Cagli and Renzo Vespignani. A water-color drawing by William Blake, formerly in the Graham Robertson Collec tion, was secured for the John L. Severance Collection. Gifts of drawings came from various sources: Edward B. Greene gave a most important Giovanni Battista Tiepolo; Mr. and Mrs. Lewis B. Williams, a pencil drawing by Modigliani; Leonard C. Hanna, Jr., four drawings by George W. Bellows, one by Maillol, and one by Toulouse-Lautrec. The Department of Decorative Arts also had an extra ordinary year. A few of its important purchases were Byzantine and medieval, additions to the J. H. Wade Collection, which ranks among the greatest collections in these fields in the world. Paramount was the group of four pieces of Byzantine silver I55</page><page sequence="6">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART three chalices and a paten. They may very well be the three earliest chalices known and are before the year A.D. 434. Their inscriptions are of great interest, and a foremost Byzantine scholar, Louis Brehier, presented to the Academie des Inscrip tions et Belles Lettres a brilliant paper on them entitled, "Un Tresor d'argenterie ancienne du sanctuaire de Rosafa-Sergiop olis au Mus6e de Cleveland." A group of four German champ leve enamel plaques from Hildesheim, twelfth century, was another purchase. A remarkable series of manuscript pages was purchased to supplement the group which is one of the features of the department. These run from an eleventh-century Byzantine page and Italian twelfth-century examples to other leaves of the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries. The finest majolica is in the J. H. Wade Collection, and three superlative plates by the greatest master of luster, Maestro Giorgio, of Gubbio, were added, as well as a double mazer of maple bole, bearing two medallions of Diirer dated I528, the year of his death. These all came from the dispersal of the Goldschmidt Rothschild Collection of Frankfurt-am-Main. From another member of the family, Anthony de Rothschild in London, came the large bouquetier of Saint-Porchaire ware. This purchase through the J. H. Wade Fund is one of that rarest of rare potteries made in the mid-sixteenth century, of which the seventy pieces known are in the greatest museums or collections. From the John L. Severance Fund the acquisitions begin with an English fourteenth-century ring. Very important are the Italian bronze inkstand by Riccio, of the early sixteenth cen tury, and the Venus by Cattaneo, of the later mid-century. There is also an exquisite goldsmith's scales, German, sixteenth century. A remarkable Venetian cup, about 1500, in glass, and a representative group of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century glasses give for the first time an adequate series in this fragile material. The eighteenth-century Savonnerie rug, with the royal coat of arms, is a fine addition, supplementing the furni ture of that period bequeathed by John L. Severance and his sister, Mrs. Francis F. Prentiss; it is the Rothschild rug from the collection of the Earl of Rosebery and is similar to two others, one at Fontainebleau, the other in the Camondo Collec tion. A superlative Cartel clock in ormolu was another purchase for the Severance Collection. 156</page><page sequence="7">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR Gifts in these divisions of the department included a finely preserved Venetian enamel plate of the early sixteenth century from Germain Seligman; a rare faience owl, about 1540, from Rosenberg and Stiebel, Inc.; two Renaissance objects of fine quality from Mrs. R. Henry Norweb. A Portuguese table of the eighteenth century also came from Mrs. Norweb, and a six teenth-century Spanish chest was presented by William G. Mather. An enameled box, Staffordshire, was a gift of Robert A. Weaver; and fine porcelain and pottery came from George W. Bierce, R. Thornton Wilson, and Judge Irwin Untermyer. The latter gift was two Buen Retiro figures and an early Meissen statuette by Kindler. A fine English marrow-scoop of silver was an anonymous gift, and Mr. and Mrs. Arthur D. Brooks gave a group of silver spoons. From The Cleveland Art Associa tion came a modern silver bowl by the Cleveland craftsman, Frederick A. Miller. Most significant were the gifts to the collection of the arts of the Americas. Mrs. R. Henry Norweb, always generous, pre sented a superb anthropomorphic figure in gold, Panama, Cocle, in memory of her aunt, Roberta Holden Bole. She gave, as well, gold from Veraguas and Ecuador; gold from Peru; a very fine coiled serpent in stone, Aztec; and a mask from the Valley of Mexico. Two rare wooden paddles from Peru concluded her gifts in this field. Mrs. Newton D. Baker made a memorial gift in honor of her husband: a large gold piece from Veraguas, which had been presented to Mr. Baker by the President of Panama. A jade plaque, Mayan, and a shell ornament from Paracas, Peru, were given by that great friend of this depart ment, Miss Helen Humphreys, in memory of her parents. Mrs. A. S. Ingalls gave a gold Quimbaya necklace, and a purchase from the James Albert Ford Memorial Fund was a tiny gold bell from Oaxaco, Mexico. John Wise most generously presented two fine Mexican pieces, one a jade, the other an important Totonac head. An eccentric flint and a jade bead, noted pieces both illustrated in Kelemen's book, were acquired for the John L. Severance Collection. Loans of great importance were the gold pieces lent for the summer by Nelson A. Rockefeller. A group of enamels and pottery by Cleveland artists was an addition to the Mary Spedding Milliken Memorial Collection, I57</page><page sequence="8">THE CLEVELAND MUSFUM OF ART and a plaster sculpture, "Young Madonna," by Katherine Bercovici, was given by James N. Rosenberg. The most important loan to this department was the magnif icent group of Italian majolica lent for two years by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Damiron. It is largely of the fifteenth century, a few pieces dating at the turn of the century, and it affords an un usual opportunity to see many rare types of the finest quality and in impeccable condition. The additions to the Oriental Department were on a very high level. The group of three Japanese sculptures, purchased through the John L. Severance Fund, gives a representation of Japan's greatest epochs. The earliest is the bronze seated statue of Miroku Bosatsu, which has been called the finest figure of this period outside of Japan. Only the war and the conditions thereafter could have brought this out of Japan. It is of the seventh century, Suiko Period-the Japanese classic period and represents this art at its highest. It was No. 6 in the catalogue of Japanese treasures shown in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in I936. A bronze Kwannon of the Hakuho Period, 646-7Io, the period after the Suiko, is another important piece. A wooden mask of a bodhisattva, twelfth century, of the Fujiwara Period, was another acquisition. From the Edward L. Whittemore Fund comes a pottery figure from a group in a nirvana scene, also of the Hakuho Period. It was supposed to have been at Horyiji. Two Chinese bronze buckles of the Han Period, 206 B.C.-A.D. 220 were also purchased by the Edward L. Whittemore Fund. Gifts to this department included a Han tile from Vladimir G. Simkhovitch; a pair of K'ang Hsi Chinese vases from Mrs. Elma M. Schniewind in memory of Dr. Frederick Schniewind; a pair of vases of the same period, from the Baroness Frieda Frasch von Seidlitz. A tour de force of technical perfection is the Chinese Kwanyin in Fukien porcelain, the gift of Mrs. R. Henry Norweb. Also purchased through the Edward L. Whittemore Fund were a scapegoat, Persian, of the Achaemenid Period, and a very early Islamic grave monument, dated A.D. II35. The Textile Department continues its careful and logical development. The importance of textiles to the collection can not be overemphasized because many of the great periods of art I58</page><page sequence="9">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR are best represented through this medium. In many cases, the use of textiles in burials is responsible for their preservation, and many of the Museum's new acquisitions have been pre served in this fashion. The purchases fall into several categories: a Coptic and Egypto-Arabic group from the collection of Dr. Emil Delmar, purchased through the John L. Severance Fund, and an Egypto-Arabic textile of the Fatimid Period, purchased from the J. H. Wade Fund; from this fund, also, came an eleventh- to twelfth-century Byzantine piece, showing the luxurious craft at its best under the Eastern Empire, and a Persian piece of the Seljuk Period, expressing the type of in fluence which passed from Asia to the masters of Constanti nople. The most important additions to the collection are three twelfth-century Hispano-Islamic textiles from the tomb in Spain of Bishop St. Bernard Calvo. Again purchases from the J. H. Wade Fund, and to be exhibited with the Guelph Treasure in the Treasure Room, they make the Hispano-Islamic portion of the textile collection one of the most representative in the world. From a later period, the fifteenth century, comes a rich half chasuble of Italian velvet, with contemporary Austrian em broidery. It is a piece of first quality and supplements the other embroideries in the J. H. Wade Collection. A group of gifts from Henry Hunt Clark, Mrs. William G. Mather, Sara Mattsson Anliot, Elsa Vick Shaw, and John Wise added to the department materially. A fine tapestry strip, probably Burgun dian, shows the height of the craft of weaving in the late fifteenth century. Remarkable is the fifteenth-century Italian tapestry from Ferrara, one of the very rare pieces of Italian provenance, which was purchased through the John L. Sever ance Fund. This tapestry was formerly in the collection of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza. In the Classical Department the well-known and often published bronze mirror, Greek, 470-460 B.C., from the Brum mer Collection, was a major acquisition through the J. H. Wade Fund. It was formerly in the collection of Sir Francis Cook and is probably of Sikyon manufacture. Its fine porportions, its rigid but graceful stance so well adapted to its purpose, and details of costume and coiffure date it in this particular decade of the fifth century. I59</page><page sequence="10">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART The year was remarkable for the two very important memorial exhibitions of the work of two Cleveland artists, Henry G. Keller and William Sommer. Catalogues were pub lished and record in proper fashion the stature of these artists in Cleveland and the place they take in the history of American art. Shown also were "New Irish Painters," "Exhibition of the Ohio Water Color Society," and "Water Colors by the National Association of Women Artists." "Contemporary Italian Draw ings" was a provocative exhibition with a different emphasis; "Domestic Architecture of the San Francisco Bay Region" showed trends in modern houses; "Cleveland Textiles, 1950," was very well received and showed the growing development of the textile craft in Cleveland; "The Sea," an exhibition built around an idea, was beautifully planned and most effectively shown. The Thirty-Second Annual May Show, in its success, broke all records for attendance and sales. The Department of Music serves most effectively, and the attendance of 23,506 at the musical events is a definite indica tion statistically of the service rendered. What figures cannot give is the quality and standard of performance and the dis tinction with which the events are presented. The two-hun dredth anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach was honored in the Museum by eight organ programs, in which the Curator was assisted by Fenner Douglas, of Oberlin. The St. Matthew Passion was given with one hundred fifty singers, with forty-five members of the Cleveland Orchestra, and with excellent soloists. Arthur Loesser gave two remarkable recitals of the first book of the "Well-tempered Clavier" of Bach; Ralph Kirkpatrick added the great "Goldberg Variation" of that master on the harpsichord. The Oberlin Musical Union and Symphony Orchestra co-sponsored the Bach "B Minor Mass" in Severance Hall. Another effective co-operative venture was the concert with the Music School Settlement, when the Muse um's audience enjoyed to the full the rare artistry of Josef Gingold and Leonard Shure. Also, the Cleveland Institute of Music aided materially in the Festival of Contemporary Music in May, when there were one performance by faculty members of the Institute and two by the Walden String Quartet. Special contributions made possible the appearance of the great harpist, Carlos Salzedo. Another unforgettable evening was the cello I6o</page><page sequence="11">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR recital by Harry Fuchs, for many years a beloved Cleveland musician. To finish off the rich fare, there was a lecture given by the famous poet, Dr. Edith Sitwell. The P. J. McMyler Musical Endowment Fund continues to carry the major part of the musical program, but without the valued assistance of the Musart Society, it would not be possible to present to the Museum's audience the high caliber of per formances which they have come to expect. The Curator gives valued service as well in his post as special lecturer at Case Institute of Technology. His class of twenty-five or more meets three times weekly in the Museum. The effective and moving Christmas Carol Service featured the Wa-Li-Ro Boy Choir, under the direction of Paul Allen Beymer, and the Karamu Singers, under the direction of J. Harold Brown. The Department of Education, with its manifold activities, had a year which was both varied and successful. The Curator was away for the first half of the year under a grant through the Fulbright Act. His series of lectures in the Sorbonne in Paris, in the University of Algiers, and at the Universities of Strasbourg, Marseilles, and Aix-en-Provence brought great honor to the Museum. During his absence the department functioned with efficiency, and the program was limited only by the personnel available. There is an insatiable demand for Museum service and as much as possible of that demand was met with devotion by the members of the staff. This is just as true of the staff furnished to the Museum by the Cleveland Public Schools. No more effective collaboration could be imagined. An additional teacher could be used with great effectiveness. The Museum's relationship through long years with the Cleveland Public School System has been made possible by the understanding sympathy of the various super intendents. Today, Mark C. Schinnerer continues that same fine co-operation, which is reflected throughout his staff; Alfred Howell, Directing Supervisor, and Mrs. Grace Z. Lange brake and Bertha K. Budde, his assistants, have aided in every way the three teachers assigned to the Museum. It seems impossible to think that Miss Ann V. Horton is no longer on active duty. Her brilliant and devoted service through many years has laid a pattern which will be hard to equal and I6I</page><page sequence="12">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART which had, and will always have, its influence on the Museum School program. Ronald Day, her right-hand man, was made Assistant Supervisor and has taken over her work. His assist ants, Juanita Sheflee and Bernard M. Weiner, are carrying on this work in a way which promises well. The Cleveland Heights and Shaker Heights Schools continue their close relationship with the Museum. So many of their teachers have at one time or another been full-time or special teachers on the Museum staff that there is a mutual under standing of problems and an ability to use to the fullest extent the facilities of the Museum. Other suburban schools are in creasingly using the Museum, while private schools are also seeking the Museum's help. This is particularly true of Laurel School. The Saturday morning classes continue their hold upon the public. A pleasant feature this year is the fact that many more Lakewood children have been present. The members' classes, the free class for any who care to come, the class for those selected because of exceptional abilities-the so-called Specially Talented Class-are the various facets of the Satur day program. Many of the teachers have been trained through long years; some have actually come up from the classes them selves, a fact which gives a considered continuity to, and en hances the freshness and vitality of, the program. The Summer Outdoor Classes had to be restricted, the enrollment being too large to be handled; these classes, financed by the income from the L. E. Holden Fund, use the Fine Arts Garden and the beautiful surroundings of the Museum so admirably maintained by the Superintendent of the Fine Arts Garden, Malcolm Martin, and his devoted staff. The Museum is interested in motion pictures as an art. A limited number of films representative of the best are chosen and shown each year to stress the elements which are of value and significance in the development of the film as a medium of expression. Western Reserve University-especially Adelbert and Flora Stone Mather Colleges-Case Institute of Technology, and the Cleveland Institute of Art, all use the Museum greatly. It is a focal point for their graduate and undergraduate courses, and the relationship of members of the Museum's staff with the 162</page><page sequence="13">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR personnel of those institutions insures the understanding co operation which is essential. The Museum in its Extension Department has much material which is available for loan. These objects are placed by mem bers of the Museum's staff in cases and on the walls of libraries, schools, and other allied organizations. The Educational Department is responsible, as well, for a series of small exhibitions of an educational nature in the Little Gallery on the main floor and in the northeast corridor on the ground floor. The lecture program has been greatly enriched by the co operation of the Garden Center of Greater Cleveland. Aid and support have come from this organization in many ways to many different departments of the Museum. Adult work must be varied and geared to demand. Clever programming of courses has materially broadened the appeal of the Museum. The courses, planned as they always are on a non-vocational basis, are sometimes jointly sponsored. The Museum is always glad to work with other organizations for a common good; the Council on World Affairs and the Cleveland Fashion Group have been of great service to the Museum. The Library serves admirably with space facilities which are painfully inadequate. In no place in the Museum is the need for larger and more adaptable quarters more essential. The services of the Library fall into three categories. There is, first, the use by the Museum's staff for research and documentation; second, there is the very considerable use by the general public; and third, there is the ever-expanding service given to the educational institutions in this region, whose programs are closely knit with the Museum. In recent years this service has been greatly extended, so that Lake Erie College, Kent State University, Akron University, Hiram, Baldwin Wallace, and other colleges come for particular aid. The Library now has 26,0I9 books. The very richness of the art collection ever increases the necessity for rare and costly publications which are essential for the adequate study of these art objects. The Museum should have the basic publications to meet this need. Intelligent buying has husbanded what are frankly quite inadequate funds for book purchases. Here is a 163</page><page sequence="14">THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART place where individual gifts could be of the greatest value for special purposes. The lending section of the Library carries on an equally invaluable service. Last year 181,668 slides were circulated from a collection which now numbers 54,996. What is important is that in recent years a very large proportion of the new slides has been in color. The use of the photograph section has in creased materially. More adequate funds here could do an invaluable service. The Department of Publicity secured excellent coverage. Through its efforts public attention was caught, and, in a year abounding in important events, many of the Museum items brought international attention. This was particularly true of the Rembrandt purchase. The newspapers have been very generous and very co-operative, and it is interesting to note the growing attention Cleveland art events secure in the local papers of the region Cleveland touches. This is markedly so at the time of the May Show, when Akron, Buffalo, Detroit, Erie, Pittsburgh, Youngstown, and other nearby cities send art editors to cover that story. Any newspaper story brings almost immediate response, particularly when it is cleverly presented, and articles in sections other than the regular art section have the additional advantage of catching the attention of those who do not read the art pages. Imaginative use of material increases greatly public attention. Another ever increasing demand is for the reproduction of Museum masterpieces in books and magazines. The radio programs have been effective, and the thought that has gone into their planning has given them variety and wide popular appeal. The Department of Photography furnishes the majority of the post cards for the Sales Desk, and, behind the scenes, it is the department which permanently records all the works of art in the Museum, makes the photographs for publicity and for the Bulletin and catalogues as published. The Department also makes the considerable number of lantern slides needed, both in black and white and in color. The Department of Printing has a busy job furnishing all forms, letterheads, weekly calendars, programs for events, and such material. Further than that, it prints the large number 164</page><page sequence="15">REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR of labels needed for the collections. Only the Bulletin and catalogues are printed outside the Museum. The Registrar and Recorder handles the receipt of all objects entering the building and also inspects any object that is shipped from the Museum. This responsible job insures proper checking of condition of objects on arrival or departure and takes care of insurance coverage. A continuous record of each object, its location and all other pertinent information related to it, is carefully kept. The Tea Room has a constant clientele. It is of invaluable use to the staff, to many visitors, and to club groups. The Muse um's location in a park a considerable distance away from public restaurants makes the Tea Room a convenience and a real necessity. It has won a large public through its excellent cuisine and its courteous service. The Department of Buildings and Grounds keeps the Mu seum in excellent physical condition. The air-conditioning system and the precipitrons have been a great aid in main taining the collections and in reducing the inevitable toll of dirt. The wear and tear on a building thirty-five years old is in evitable, and through the past year a thorough job of repointing on the exterior and on the terraces was carried through. The personnel of this department in its various sections has given efficient and loyal service. Long service is characteristic of the staff as a whole, and it is regrettable that illness made it necessary for Theodore Hamil ton to retire on pension after twenty-three years of service. The staff is happy that he is able to enjoy the leisure his faithful service deserves. A tribute should be paid, also, to the entire Museum personnel. It is through them, working loyally and efficiently upon their particularized jobs, that the Museum has been brought to its present level of efficiency. WILLIAM M.
