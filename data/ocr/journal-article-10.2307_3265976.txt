<plain_text><page sequence="1">476 JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Gottes Trauer und Klage in der rabbinischen Uberlieferung (Talmud und Midrasch), by Peter Kuhn. AGJU 13. Leiden: Brill, 1978. Pp. xiii+559. HF1 140. Kuhn studies God's mourning and lamentation as recounted in rabbinic literature in order to understand the rabbis' perception of God manifested in an unusual and striking theme. Kuhn does not limit himself to certain terms, but attends to a subject matter which includes acts and words of mourning and lamentation as well as the inner sorrow which accompanies them. This dissertation, essentially completed in 1973, analyzes 75 texts found in 231 loci. The commentary on the texts, which covers 300 pages, includes a translation (more than one if versions vary significantly), notes on the sources, notes on the dating of the traditions, and then an explanation of the themes and particulars of the passage. The commentary is generally competent and thorough and it forms a good basis for the 150 pages of general conclusions which complete the study. The problem of dating the sources plagues Kuhn, as it does all scholars. He uses mainly the attributions and sometimes a comparison of versions to conclude that the major themes were widespread from the first to sixth centuries. These passages were picked up in the later medieval collections, such as the Yalkut Shimoni, where they are very frequent. His conclusion is generally acceptable as long as we recognize that we cannot know in detail how these traditions developed or exactly when they took shape. It is appropriate that Kuhn treats his material thematical- ly throughout the first ten centuries with occasional reference to medieval and modern Jewish literature. He would have made the study more useful if he had arranged his texts by their source (with cross-references for multiple appearances) rather than chronologically according to content, running from Eden to the Messiah. References to God's mourning occur predominantly in connection with calamities which afflict Israel; over half of the texts refer to the two destructions of Jerusalem and the Temple. The general purpose of these passages is to offer Israel consolation through reflection on God's own suffering and sympathy with Israel. A second theme often accompanies that of consolation: Israel is admonished to engage in better behavior and warned against the sin that caused the calamities in the first place. The interaction between God and Israel involves first and foremost God's very positive response to Israel's suffering. God himself suffers, mourns, laments, uses sackcloth, observes seven day periods of mourning, and engages in all the customs and words demanded by rabbinic mourning. Both the spontaneous and ritual aspects of God's behavior are emphasized. In chap. 3 Kuhn inquires how seriously the rabbis took these statements and enters into a discussion of anthropomorphism. The language used in the texts reflects some concern for this question since parables, indirect constructions, and expressions such as kbykwl are often used. Yet through all the texts the authors and audience believe that God is being described and presented as he really is, not just in some metaphoric way removed from reality. Kuhn suggests that this view of God is communicated by the genres of Volksdichtung and Scriptural interpretation. A comparison of God's mourning in rabbinic literature with the OT reveals a defi- nite change in perception. The OT focuses more on God's inner sorrow and hurt and links this reaction to his anger and coming judgment or to his compassion which will save Israel. The rabbinic texts are more intense in that God physically manifests his grief by acts of mourning, but there is no connection with God as judge or savior. Israel derives consolation from the fact that God is sad and desolate just as it is. This shift of perspective is reflected in the use of OT texts in these passages. Rabbinic literature seldom uses the OT texts which speak of God's sorrow and lamenting because they also speak of his anger or judgment. Rather, other texts are adapted to the needs of the exposition, and God's compassion and suffering are emphasized. In the end Kuhn</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 477 concludes that the rabbinic view gives meaning to the human pain being experienced by Israel in the centuries of trouble during which these midrashim were written. Kuhn's treatment is generally balanced and nuanced. He does not squeeze conclusions from twisted texts. His analysis of the Realitdtsgehalt of God's mourning and lamentation pits a vague idea of "real" against the "merely" metaphorical without doing justice to the many and sophisticated meanings which relate these two expres- sions to one another. His synthetic section suffers from the lumping together of diverse sources into a rabbinic whole. Kuhn alludes to this in his foreword when he says that in the five years between composition and publication the problem of the historical ordering of texts became more clear to him. Though much progress is made in his study, the absence of an historical reconstruction of the tradition is a serious deficiency. In the end, Kuhn has elucidated the theme of God's mourning and lamentation accurately and well, and his work contributes to an understanding of the complex relationship between Israel and God in late antiquity.

The Facsimile Edition of the Nag Hammadi Codices put all thirteen codexes in the public domain by the end of 1977, and English and German editions of the tractates are being produced by members of the Claremont Coptic Gnostic Library Project (James M. Robinson, director) and the Berlin Arbeitskreis fir Koptisch-gnostische Schriften (Hans-Martin Schenke, leader). Now a French edition is also appearing as fascicles in the Bibliotheque copte de Nag Hammadi, of which Menard is the editor-in-chief. (Progress reports on these modern-language editions were delivered at the First International Congress of Coptology in December 1976; those of Schenke and M6nard are included in Nag Hammadi and Gnosis [ed. R. McL. Wilson; NHS 14; Leiden: Brill, 1978, 108-16].) As Menard notes in the foreword to La Lettre de Pierre a Philippe, the French project intends two kinds of presentations, "Texts" and "Studies." The fascicles reviewed here constitute the first two contributions in the series of "Texts"; and the publication of the Ep. Pet. Phil. (VIII,2) and the Auth. Teach. (VI,3), two important tractates which until now have received comparatively little attention, provides a fitting occasion for the inauguration of the series. M6nard begins his presentations with brief introductions. While sizable portions of these introductions are devoted to paraphrases and outlines of the contents of the tractates, M6nard also discusses some of the unique problems encountered in each tractate. In the Ep. Pet. Phil., for example, we face the issue of literary genre: how are we to reconcile the epistolary title (132,10-11) and the letter itself (132,12-133,8) with the non-epistolary contents of most of the body of the tractate (133,8-140,27), which offers questions and answers on Christian gnostic doctrines? In general, Menard states, the Ep. Pet. Phil. resembles a gnostic dogmatic</page></plain_text>
