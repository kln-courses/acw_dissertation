<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIRDS &amp; US MAURA C. FLANNERY, DEPARTMENT EDITOR I am sitting down to write this article in early sum- mer, and lately I've heard more than one person complain about birds waking them up in what my human friends consider the middle of the night-3:00 or 4:00 am. As often happens when I think about the living world, I'm reminded of something Aldo Leopold (1949) wrote, in this case, in an essay called "Too Early." He describes the very early morn- ing, before first light, as the "most pleasant and least useful time" (p. 59), and "to arrive too early in the marsh is an adventure in pure listening" (p. 61). I'll admit that I am not as willing as Leopold was to put on the coffee pot and then go out with a notebook to enjoy the sounds of nature, but I don't mind lying in bed and letting the birds keep me awake for awhile. They are so passionate about their business, so seemingly earnest and industrious, to declare that their day has started and that others better respect their presence. I live in a suburb just outside New York City, so we have grass and bushes and trees, and therefore we have birds. Nothing too exotic, but enough different species to make the sounds of the morning interesting. Yet even in Manhattan, there are a lot of birds. Yes, pigeons count in my book. I know they are a nuisance, but just spend some time observing them, and you have to appreciate their skill, industriousness, and persistence. However, because of Central Park, there are more species of birds in Manhattan than in many other urban areas. As Jonathan Rosen (2008) explains in his book on birds, Central Park is such a great bird Mecca precisely because it is in the middle of the city-birds are attracted to the only large green area in a sea of buildings. Rosen lives in Manhattan and does his bird watching in the Park, as do many others. Marie Winn (1998) has written a great book on New York City birders and their passions. New York &amp; Israel Rosen emphasizes the distinction between bird watch- ers and birders. The latter are interested in how many dif- ferent kind of birds they see and keep life lists of species they've observed, lists that some of them passionately and even fanatically attempt to extend. Rosen considers himself a bird watcher; he is less interested in the number of spe- cies he's seen than in the experience of watching the birds he happens to encounter. His book is a pleasant ramble through his musings about birds, musings with a couple of different themes. First, he is interested in American his- tory as it relates to birds. This gives him a chance to weave MAURA C.

She earned a B.S. in biology from Marymount Manhattan College; an M.S., also in biology, from Boston College; and a Ph.D. in science education from New York University. Her major interests are in communicating science to the nonscientist and in the relation- ship between biology and art. Henry David Thoreau and John James Audubon into his story. He also dwells on Walt Whitman, who was brought up in Brooklyn and then spent his last years in neighboring New Jersey. One of Whitman's early poems on the mocking- bird sets Rosen off on a discussion of birds and the poetic imagination. Theodore Roosevelt, another New Yorker, also gets Rosen's attention. Even though Roosevelt hunted birds, his conservation efforts saved many as well. Like all of us, Roosevelt was a person of his time, when guns and wild- life had very different connotations than they do today. Roosevelt was a student of birds and wrote articles for the ornithological journal, The Auk. Rosen sees Roosevelt as a symbol of America's awakening to the value of its wild heritage. What poets like Whitman and Emily Dickenson were aware of in the 19th century, Roosevelt brought into the consciousness of the general public. Rosen also touches on a particularly thorny conservation case, that of the ivory- bill woodpecker as a symbol of the loss of wilderness, and whether or not it still persists in Southern swamps. As Eric Stokstad (2007) notes, the euphoria over the announcement in 2005 of evidence for the bird's presence in Arkansas has subsided and many ornithologists are now skeptical of the evidence. This doubt increases as later searches have found no new signs of ivorybills. In the second half of the book, Rosen makes a big geographical leap from New York to Israel. I liked the whole book. The first half dealt with topics that I was familiar with, but he gave them a new twist, and wove them together in interesting ways-tying Teddy Roosevelt and the poet Robert Frost together, for example. But for me, Israel really is foreign territory, especially as far as birds are concerned. When I think of Israel I think of geopolitics and religious heritage, not wildlife, yet I did have an inkling of this other aspect of the country from Bruce Feiler's (2001) great book, Walking the Bible. But while for Feiler, nature is part of a big- ger picture, for Rosen, it is the focus of his travelogue. He notes that Israel's limited territory means that humans and wildlife are vying for territory as much as they are in New York. Yet as the country matured, the need for conservation became more apparent. Israel's leading ornithologist, Yossi Lesham has established a birdwatching center in Latrun overlooking the Ayalon Valley and along a major bird migra- tion route. The center's motto is "Migrating birds know no boundaries," and one of Lesham's goals is to have Jew and Arab join in observing and protecting these apolitical creatures. Rosen writes movingly of his time in the Middle East and devotes a chapter to the hoopoe, a beautifully crested bird that Arabs revere in part because it cares for its parents in old age (what a concept!). In this chapter, Rosen weaves in more poetry, this time a 12th century Sufi verse called "The Conference of Birds" and manages to tie his trip to Israel back to American history by noting that Ralph Waldo Emerson studied Sufism and quoted from this same poem in an essay on Persian verse. It is such skillful integration of Biology Today 498 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 70, NO. 8, OCTOBER 2008</page><page sequence="2">themes, as well thoughtful reflections, that make Rosen's book so satisfying. It is about birds, and a biologist can pick up some information about them here, but it is even more about birds in relation to many other parts of our lives. It's a reminder that birds matter to us in so many ways. City &amp; Country Birds Of course, birds themselves provide us with countless such reminders, including waking us at 4:00 am in the early summer. What we should try to remember as we're attempting to get back to sleep is that we're very lucky to have these creatures; they are the species that are willing and able to share our environment. We are not going to see an ivorybill in our backyards. They became extinct, or close to it, because they need large territories and no interference from alien species like Homo sapiens. Instead we share our environment with house sparrows and starlings, that are themselves alien species. Perhaps that's why we can live together; we are all highly adaptable and can make do with less than perfect living conditions. A house sparrow can live behind a shutter, and we can live on top of each other in apartment buildings. There have been a number of research studies recently on just such avian accommodations to human-made environmental changes. A long-term study of British Great Tits, Parus major, reveals that these birds lay their eggs an average of two weeks earlier now than they did in 1961 (Charmantier et al., 2008). This change seems driven by the earlier development of moth larvae used to feed the chicks. Another study on these birds finds that those living in urban areas have shorter and faster songs, at a higher frequency, than those in forested areas. This is appar- ently an adaptation to low-frequency traffic noise; the birds are attempting to be heard over the din (Slabbekoorn &amp; den Boer- Visser, 2006). Researchers speculate that birds that cannot make such accommodations are the ones that disappear as an area becomes more developed. Another difference was found between urban and rural European blackbirds, Turdus merula. This species is partially migratory, but biologists discovered the males living in built-up regions were less inclined to migrate than those in the country (Partecke &amp; Gwinner, 2007). There was no such difference among females. It may be an advantage for urban males to stay home because they then have access to prime breeding habitats that may be in shorter supply in city versus country areas. But city living, and suburban as well, can present other problems for birds besides scarce real estate. Australian biologists found that walking leashed dogs along woodland paths significantly reduced the number and diversity of birds in the area (Banks &amp; Bryant, 2007). Bird numbers were down by over 40% and species numbers by 35%. These numbers are significant and is a good reminder that dogs are large predators, at least as far as birds are concerned, and leashes probably mean little to them. Interestingly, it made no difference if the dogs were introduced into areas where dog walking was allowed as opposed to where it was forbidden and thus where birds would ordinarily have seen few canines. The researchers assumed that the birds would become inured to the dogs, and so the decrease would be less in areas where dogs were commonly walked, but it turned out that this variable made no difference. Birds were just as afraid of dogs when they were accustomed to seeing them as when they weren't. But what about humans? Are the birds really afraid of the dogs, or is it the tall biped at the other end of the leash who is really scary? Well, humans walking unaccompanied also have an effect on bird numbers but less than half that caused by people with dogs. Some humans do try to be sensitive to the needs of birds, and one way of expressing this is with bird feeders. But do they really make a difference? Well, at least for one species they do. Researchers in Northern Ireland paired ten patches of woodland area, and in one of each pair hung wire mesh peanut feeders from trees, beginning in November and extending to early March (Robb et al., 2008). They were attempting to mimic the kinds of supplements provided by backyard feeders. The effect of the food supplements was significant. In the areas where the peanuts were available, the birds laid their eggs earlier and had, on average, one more surviving chick per nest-yet the clutch sizes were the same. This would make you want to run out and buy a bird feeder, but remember, this study was done in forested areas, not in urban backyards where other factors like dogs and cats, limited terri- tory, and squirrel competition at the feeders may all work limit the effectiveness of extra food. Clams &amp; Cats In some cases, human impact on feeding may be more indirect. The Manila clam was brought to Britain in the 1980s as a new seafood item. In at least one area, in Dorset, the clam has become naturalized. While in some cases, like the zebra mussel, introduction of alien mollusks has wrecked havoc with local ecosystems, in this case, the clam has improved conditions for as least one species, the European oystercatcher, Haematopus ostralegus ostralegus, which winters in Britain (Lincoln, 2007). A study of these birds indicates that a large portion of the 1,200 birds feeding in Poole Harbor eat the clams, and in fact, these mollusks make up a significant part of the birds' diet. This is a new behavior and has so far kept the clam population from soar- ing as it has in other areas. The clams are probably attracted to the locally warm sea temperatures, and it may be that as global warming continues, the Manila clam will move further north. As with other alien species, it's difficult to predict the extent if its spread or the damage it might do, but at least some birds may benefit, and in doing so, perhaps keep the clam at bay. This is just one more example of the fact that ecological interactions are incredibly complex and difficult to predict. Another great example of this dilemma involves efforts to save seabird populations on islands by eradicating alien preda- tors such as cats and rats introduced to the islands by humans. There are any number of examples of native island bird species being threatened and even becoming extinct because they have no defenses against non-native mammal predators. However, a New Zealand study suggests that eradicating such a predator may make things worse rather than better (Le Come, 2008). Examining 35 years of data from Little Barrier Island off the coast of New Zealand, ecologists found a severe decline in the population of Cook's petrel following elimination of the island's cats. The petrel is a burrowing species, and its breeding success decreased considerably as the rat population increased, since there were no longer cats around to control the rodents. The human mind gravitates to simple cause-effect relationships, and so it would seem that less cats would mean more petrels, but eco- logical webs just don't work that way. Yet we need to be reminded of this over and over again. This is a good case study to use with students because it involves three groups that everyone is familiar with-cats, rats, and birds-so the relationships would seem to be relatively simple. But add in the complexities of an island habitat, and par- ticular species requirements, things quickly become muddy, and more interesting. This is indicative of the relatively common situ- ation where there's invasion by more than one alien species, so BIOLOGY TODAY 499</page><page sequence="3">ENTER TO WIN A VERNIER LABQU EST Hands-On Workshops FOR BIOLOGY/AP BIOLOGY FREE NABT .

Another interesting element in the Cook's petrel story is that the rats' impact on the birds depended on the altitude at which the petrels nested: the higher the altitude the worse the predation. This probably means that near sea level the rats have a greater variety of prey and so don't feed so heavily on birds. Dangers It's obvious that the dangers to birds today are legion. I'll just mention a couple of examples before leaving this difficult topic. Statistical analyses of the effect of the West Nile virus on birds throughout North America indicate that reductions in bird populations correlate with the virus' prevalence. This pattern is seen across years and throughout the continent. There is also a correlation with epidemics of human West Nile infections. The virus was first identified in the Western Hemisphere when both avian and human infections occurred in New York in 1999. Since then, the West Nile virus has killed individuals in almost 200 birds species in North America, in addition to other wild and domestic animals. Between 1999 and 2006, almost 24,000 human cases of West Nile were reported, resulting in almost 1,000 deaths. As with many alien infections, the virus seems to be more virulent in the New than in the Old World. In the latter, human and avian infections are both less severe. It is amazing- and disturbing-that in less than 10 years, the virus has spread cross country, the result of having the effective help of flying vec- tors and of environmental changes. As Carsten Rahbek (2007) notes: "We are witnessing the emergence of novel diseases at an unprecedented rate ... Human-induced changes in ecological systems and climate are now triggering a barrage of emerging diseases" (p. 653). In the case of island predators and West Nile virus, humans are the indirect agents of bird population decreases, but in many areas humans are directly responsible for these declines. Richard Stone (2007) reports on the efforts of Pilai Poonswad to save Rhinoceros hornbills and other species of the hornbill genus in Thailand, home to almost half the Asian hornbills. These birds are threatened by poachers who kill them for their prized bills and also by insurgents battling in the politically unstable south- ern provinces. Poonswad leads the Thailand Hornbill Project that not only seeks to preserve the hornbills and their habitat, but also works with Islamic communities to improve their liv- ing conditions in predominantly Buddhist Thailand. These two efforts are related since bettering economic conditions means hornbill poaching becomes less attractive. Poonswad had gained so much community backing that former poachers rarely take up their former ways; their neighbors see to it. Some are employed in studies of the birds and in monitoring their populations. One American colleague considers her influence on conservation in her country to be without peer, "an icon for indigenous Asian science" (p. 592). This story at least has hopeful aspects, though the political situation is still difficult and the area inaccessible, making further research difficult. Smart Birds Now to turn to less depressing aspects of ornithology and to studies that are done under controlled conditions rather than in the wild, studies that point to a level of intelligence among birds that was previously unsuspected. Nicola Clayton is a psychologist who studies western scrub jays, Aphelocoma coerulescens, and has done experiments strongly suggesting that the birds plan ahead. She has created an environment where the quantity and quality 500 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 70, NO. 8, OCTOBER 2008</page><page sequence="4">of the food available to the jays varies from day to day, and they respond to this by storing up high-quality food for the lean days (More11, 2007). This is a clear indication of planning ahead, something that birds weren't thought capable of, though there is some evidence that nonhuman primates are. While some orni- thologists are leery of the results, Clayton's experiments were carefully designed to rule out the effects of training. Clayton benefits from the fact that she has long studied jays in the wild and has observed their memory feats, though some of her observations are in less than wild habitats. She noticed that when she and colleagues were eating outdoors, the jays would steal bits of their sandwiches and hide them, then return later to retrieve the cache. I think we've all had similar experiences of rel- atively tame creatures wanting to share an outdoor lunch with us, but this is a good example of a mind prepared to do something more with the experience. In subsequent studies, Clayton discov- ered that the jay hippocampus grows in response to consistent use of its memory in storing food for future use. Clayton has also found that jays seem to be aware of their own thieving behavior which makes them wary of other jays who might do the same. Clayton sees this as indicating what psychologists call a "theory of mind," something that many researchers link to language and therefore only possible for humans. The jay work is one more example of how the great divide between animal and human intelligence-itself an inge- nious human construct-is beginning to be questioned on a variety of fronts. TV News shows reported last year on stud- ies of chimp's short-term memory feats that couldn't even be approached by college students (http://abcnews.go.com/ Technology/wireStory?id=3954629). Seeing the difference in the rate at which the two species touched the computer screen was fascinating, if not a little embarrassing for the members of my species. Birds, too, have performed well in other intellectual areas that were thought to be off limits to the bird-brained. In a New Yorker profile, Margaret Talbot (2008) describes the parrot studies done by Irene Pepperberg, particularly those with a bird called Alex, whose name was an acronym for Avian Learning Experiment. It's well-known that parrots are great mimics and some have quite extensive vocabularies that they often use on cue. This is not deemed real language which can be defined as choosing words as responses in conversation. Considering their limited brain size and their position on the evolutionary tree-far away from the exalted primates-parrots were thought to be incapable of anything close to language. But as with Clayton's studies on planning and theories of mind, Pepperberg's work suggests otherwise. Talbot recounts what Diana Reiss, a cognitive psychologist, experienced during her first encounter with Alex. She was alone with him, and after a few minutes he said to her: "Wanna go knee." When she put out her hand, he hopped from there to her knee and then said "Tickle," and put his head down. After a tickle, Reiss picked up a red toy car and asked Alex what it was. He said "Truck." This whole experience gave Reiss a feeling she was actual-, ly communicating with Alex. Now there are more Pavlovian expla- nations for what was going on here, but Pepperberg did many careful studies on Alex before he died, and has published this work in peer-reviewed scientific journals. She does her research at Brandeis University, though the parrots she works with now have not achieved Alex's level of achievement. This is one criticism of her work: that Alex was an anomaly and that theories cannot be built on exceptions to the rule. But Thomas Kuhn argued that anomalies do sometimes lead to the overthrow of theories. Only time will tell if there is real substance to Pepperberg's work. Since I am not even a novice in the field of cognitive psychol- ogy I'm incapable of judging the parrot research, but I think it's suggestive of that bridge I mentioned earlier. Pepperberg is obvi- ously a maverick but she has gained at least some credibility over the years, and she does not work in a vacuum. Her research is influenced by theories such as those of the psychologist Nicholas Humphrey who argued that complex social hierarchies, such as those among some bird species, could drive evolution of intel- ligence. Pepperberg also contends that the long lifespan of the parrot would lead to selection for greater intelligence; it would be an advantage to remember things over a long period of time. In a very different article, the biologist Bridget Stutchbury (2007) writes of birds as victims of environmental change and also as symbols of hope in our culture. At one point she writes, "Birds have noticed the change in climate" (p. B10). This could be viewed as a form of anthropomorphism, of attributing human mental abilities to animals which clearly don't have. But still, I think we all know what Stutchbury is referring to, the birds' sensing of temperature change in terms of fluctuations in food abundance or nesting opportunities, or other environmental factors. All this talk of animal intelligence and what it involves revolves around the human definition of intelligence, and if our handling of the environment is any measure of our intelligence then maybe we shouldn't be so quick to denigrate the abilities of other species.
