<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS is a worthwhile addition. One or two other passages might well have been added from Plutonis Ratstiibl (pp. 618 if. and, especially, 639 ff. in Simplicianische Schriften, Winkler Diinndruckausgabe). On the whole, however, this book is eminently successful. Anyone who reads it will hardly feel inclined to complain that it is a cart before the horse-a first-rate, annotated translation of an important, yet lesser work, undertaken before a comparable rendering of the great novel to which it is a sequel! Rutgers University KENNETH NEGUS PAGE, ALEX (tr.), Three Plays by Ernst Barlach. Minneapolis: The University of Minnesota Press (1964). 224 pp. $5.50 This translation of 3 plays by Ernst Barlach performs a long overdue service by introducing the artist as a playwright to the English-speaking world. For a long time Barlach the writer was eclipsed by Barlach the sculptor, whose reputation had been firmly established in the twenties. The dramatist, however, received hardly more than an "Achtungserfolg" when his plays were occasionally performed in Germany during his life time. Suppressed and forgotten in the Nazi era, Barlach was rediscovered after World War II, along with the other expressionist writers and artists. Since then his plays have been performed frequently in Germany and are now beginning to be recognized as one of the important contributions to modern dramatic literature. Unfortunately, this recognition has so far been limited entirely to Germany, because of the absence of any translations, whereas Barlach's sculptures and graphic art, represented in museums and collections all over the world, have received international recognition and appreciation. If only for this reason, Page's translation of Barlach's plays Die Siindflut, Der Blaue Boll, and Die Echten Sedemunds deserves high acclaim and gratitude. But lest this be mistaken for damning with faint praise, I hasten to add that this is an excellent transla- tion-congenial, empathetic, extremely readable-a substantial achieve- ment, which must be rated all the higher since the task of translating Barlach is indeed a formidable, almost impossible one. For the dramas reflect Barlach's highly personal style and "Sprachgefiihl." Their lan- guage is rich in unusual imagery, poetic devices, regional allusions, puns, plays on and with words, and a grotesque sense of humor, which makes the task of the Barlach translator arduous and demanding; his is the responsibility of keeping alive the vitality and dramatic force of the original language which-in the broadest sense-could be called lyrical. The plays are largely devoid of plot and have little action, making it all the more important to preserve the lyricisms and mood-evoking aspects of Barlach's language in order to recreate the overall impact of his dramatic art. 653</page><page sequence="2">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY Page has handled this difficult task with a fine feeling for the intrinsic values and hues of the original text. He makes good use of the affinity of the English language which often permits a close approximation or imitation of alliterative effects, as for instance: "Be faithful you fool, for faith is your advantage" (p. 32) for "Sei treu, du Tropf, denn Treue ist dein Vorteil" (Ernst Barlach, Das Dichterische Werk, 1. Bd. Die Dramen. Miinchen 1956, p. 324. This edition is always cited for German quotes), or "you . . . cool my kindling thanks with artful contradictions" (33) for "ihr . . . er- kiiltet mit widerhaariger Kunst den aufgekeimten Dank" (p. 325), or "Scrambled eggs make one scamper and scramble . . ." (102) for "Riihrei macht einen riistig und riihrig . . ." (p. 202). Needless to say, in a number of cases such closeness to the original is impossible. The translator has exercised good judgment as to where close adherence to the original would make it impossible to preserve or strengthen the intended meaning. An excellent example for this situation is Page's translation of the line "Professor Druckhammer war meines Vaters Zuflucht fir und fir, . . ." (p. 194) as "Professor Latchbolt was again and again my father's last court of appeal, . . ." (p. 95). Barlach alluded, of course, to the beginning of the 19th Psalm, but the English translation (Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations) is in this case so different from the German (Herr, Gott, Du bist unsre Zuflucht fir und fir) that the free translation is fully justified because it expresses the meaning more lucidly. This fine translation has a few flaws which, one would hope, could be eliminated in a 2nd edition. Obvious misreadings are in The Flood the translation of ". . . im wilden Blut gebriiht . . ." (p. 323) as ". . . hatched me in wild blood . . ." (p. 31), and in The Blue Boll ". . . was Totes . . ." (p. 421) as ". .. something deadly . . ." (p. 193). Some idioms are unnecessarily loosely translated, e.g., "Glaubst du, daB er ein einziges Mal mit Essen iiberschligt, . . ." (p. 380) is not "Do you think just for once he'd throw up . . ." but rather . . .he'd skip a meal. . . . In the Genuine Sedemunds (p. 94) "you . . . can wash my head" does not confer the meaning of the German idiom "(du) . . . kannst mir den Kopf waschen" (p. 193) which means "set me rightt" In the same play the English idiom "that's Greek to me" led the translator into a misreading of the German ". .. der Doktor bestimmt . . . meinen Fall griechisch, . . ." rendering it as ". . . the doctor decides . . . that my case is Greek to him," whereas the meaning is: the doctor gives my case a fancy Greek name. In The Blue Boll (p. 181) we find "Someone has put something over on you" as a translation of the 2nd sentence in the following exchange: "Herr, wo sind Sie mit meiner Frau abgeblieben? Boll: Das lassen Sie sich von sonst jemand erziihlen." Here, I believe, the meaning of the German idiom 'Sie haben sich was erziihlen lassen' has been read into Boll's straightforward reply that the answer to the question would have to come from someone else. 654</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS A final item shows an interesting cultural misunderstanding. In The Blze Boll (p. 419) the innkeeper Elias tells Boll that his (Elias') wife has locked the cabinet which holds the fancy liqueurs, and has gone to bed with the keys. He then continues: "Aber die ganze ordinare Apotheke will gern verwandt mit dem Herrn werden." Apotheke stands here for Hausapotheke, the unlocked chest with everyday home remedies, used here as a simile for the cupboard for ordinary drinks. Hence the last line of this passage ought to be rendered as "But my ordinary medicine chest would appreciate your patronage," not "But any ordinary pharmacy would appreciate your patronage." However, the translation of these Barlach plays suffers little from these flaws-and there are others-because Page has succeeded in recreating in its totality the mood and the poetic imagery of the orig- inals. His translation may be compared to the reproduction of a painting which enables us by and large to experience the composition and tonal values of the original, even if here and there a color is not quite truly reproduced. The value of this book is, finally, greatly enhanced by the thought- ful, informed, and sensitive introduction by Page, who focuses the reader's attention on the essential ideas, techniques, and aesthetic values of the plays. In emphasizing the grotesque element in Barlach's plays (for further details of this interesting aspect see Edison M. Chick, "Comic and Grotesque Elements in Ernst Barlach," Mod. Lang. Quarterly, Vol. 20, No. 2, June 1959), he makes the thought-provoking suggestion that one might have here a complement to the sculptures and graphic art where the grotesque is almost absent. This raises interesting questions about the relationship between Barlach's plastic, graphic, and literary work, and points to the complex and contradictory nature of this interrelationship. In characterizing Barlach's plays as "Christian drama of redemption" Page goes, in my opinion, too far, in view of the artist's reiterated rejection of the Christian dogma and any form of anthropomorphic religion. This is not contradicted by the fact that Barlach at the same time admitted-and admired- the cultural force and imagery of cultic tradition which, in a sense, he longed to continue in his art, as shown by his frequently expressed desire to create for the "sakralen Raum." The introduction, finally, refers to Barlach's place in the broader spectrum of German expressionism, many striking characteristics of which he shared, although he personally kept aloof from "schools," movements, manifestos and organizations. Only in the last years of his life did the threat of Nazi barbarism move him to state his views and philosophy in public. Page's contribution as a critic and interpreter adds greatly to the value of this book, especially for readers who are not very familiar with the art and literature of Barlach's times. It is therefore regrettable 655</page><page sequence="4">THE GERMAN QUARTERLY that for easily surmisable reasons it was impossible to add some illustrations of Barlach's plastic and graphic work. One might hope that a 2nd edition could bring such enrichment, making readers con- scious of Barlach's versatile genius. Princeton University WERNER HOLLMANN SCHWEBELL, GERTRUDE CLORIUS (tr.), Contemporary German Poetry: An Anthology. Introduction by Victor Lange. New York: New Directions (1964). 186 pp. $2.75 The year 1933 seems to represent a "full stop," cutting off a once highly important segment of Western culture. Consequently, for the last 2 decades German poetry has, more or less, been represented only by Rilke and Brecht, and possibly Benn. To be sure, a few laudable attempts were made to introduce the leading poets of the postwar period. However, the translations (Rothenberg, Middleton, et al.) were often too inadequate to be of educational interest and did not rouse any public or scholarly concern. It must be welcomed, therefore, that now for the first time we have a small bilingual anthology of solely post-war German poems in translations providing a good text for students. The translations are faithful and accurate, carrying over into English the poetic styles of the originals, their power and metaphor, their keen observation, and their sincerity of feeling. Indeed, Miss Schwebell often succeeds in transporting meter and rhyme and the poetic imagery into the equivalent English, "transcreating," one might say, making each selection a poetic work in its own right. The 39 poets of this selection are so very different in their view- points, their poetic style and their age, that one cannot expect one translator to have full empathy with the spirit of all of them, but all the translations are carefully wrought, and none shown undue favori- tism. The translator has selected the poems not only for their poetic quality and their content, but also for their "translatability," which is commendable. As to the contents, the translator-editor doubtless intended to show the German post-war period as most German poets see it, and the selection represents their view of the post-war German malaise-of- conscience. Since we are conditioned to see contemporary things with a grain of political prejudice, we may rightly wonder about the strange company we find here. Brecht, Miegel, Nelly Sachs and Hans Leip, R. A. Schroeder and Celan, Benn and Krolow, Giinter Grass and F. G. Jiinger; contrasts, indeed, but gifted poets all. As in all anthologies, the selection cannot please everybody's preference and taste. Why is "X" missing? Why is "Y" included? Why only one poem by Brecht? Most probably because Brecht is well known, and R. H. Hays' edition of his Selected Poems (Grove Press, 1959) 656</page></plain_text>
