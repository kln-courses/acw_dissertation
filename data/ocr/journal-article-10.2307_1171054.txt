For sake of convenience, this world will be de-limited by the present frontiers of France-a decision of pure form with no implication of tri-color or fleur-de-lys. We shall be concerned with about 15 to 20 million people in every period, although there will be long intervals between actual dates. To be sure, a similar study could be carried out (and probably will be if it has not been already) among our neighbors: Germany, Italy, without a doubt Spain, but possibly not the British Isles. One of the paradoxes of such an undertaking is that the Kingdom of England, where The World We Have Lost was first defined with such penetrating insight, is of all western countries the one where that world was the least typical and the least stable. The tools and methods that I propose to employ for my purposes are not, to be sure, those of traditional historiography, even when they are rejuvenating transplants from other disciplines. It should be pointed out that there is, after all, a good deal more to scientific history than simple meditations on the role of chance, of events and worldly intrigue based-which is worse-on the rejection of sociology. At the risk of being accused of scientism, I should like to take this opportunity to defend the point of view of the noble savage. In their innocence, which is not to be confused with naivet6, many historians of the Annales school, including me, are more smitten by Labrousse than by Rickert, more by Goubert than by Amminius Marcellinus. For us, the study of accident in history implies that of necessity, particularly when the lat- ter assumes the aspect of regularity or statistical probability. There is no question, in this connection, of denying the innovating roles of events, even if they do not deserve to be rehabilitated a la Seignobos, which is what a pseudo-revolutionary school of histori- ography (which considers the very use of footnotes as bourgeois) would have us do. But that is just the point. The best studies of "narrative history" in an objective and by no means a pejorative sense are those * Inaugural lecture at the Collkge de France, November 30, 1973.

This is done in order to determine whether or not it was the event in question that made the difference. Such is the procedure of the American cliometricians of Fogel's school. They seek to discover if some major event in the history of the United States, for example the War of Independence, actually played the role generally assigned to it in economic developments. According to the canons of a sort of "historical-fiction," they postulate the absence of the particular event they are considering and then they reconsider vari- ous series of data in chronological order from that time forward. The paradox here is that such studies encourage their authors to quantify; to have recourse in the end-what a sacrilege-to the good old com- puter. In this connection, one might say of quantitative history what Jean Jaurbs said of the Patrie: A smattering of events discourages quan- tification, while a plethora of events has just the opposite effect. Of course, it is well known that in this-albeit, highly specialized-sector of economic history, similar forms of verification have not been particu- larly encouraging for true believers in the simple rehabilitation of the history of events. In such matters, the procedure adopted by Paul Bois could prove to be more rewarding. He studied thread by thread and figure by figure the major trends in the economic and political history of his Bocage, working backward in time. In the course of his regressive, almost psychoanalytic enquiry, Bois identifies the origins of the conser- vativism of western France in the passing trauma of the Chouannerie.1 Thus, in the beginning of what becomes an apparent and pressing neces- sity lies a mutation. But the essential point is that it was isolated a posteriori, not assumed a priori. It seems to me that pure narrative history or "immediate history," whether it be a call to the colors or a manning of the barricades, prostitutes itself to a legitimate but often trivial need. In an age when the mass media, in McLuhan's words, sometimes confuse the message and the massage, and dissolve the logical processes of intellectual medi- tation and the written word, it may be natural for "immediate" history to salvage the procedures of a narrative without perspective, similar to those of our medieval chronicles before the advent of Gutenberg and the printing press. Although there are some notable exceptions, never- theless there is no reason for such a position to be seen as something other than what it is: a testimony, in both the good and bad sense of the word. (The very existence of such a position reflects our contem- porary mentality very well.) The tools and the methods that we propose to use this year are not necessarily those that followers of the latest fashion would like to see the historian adopt. From the latest word on Marxism we can get a perspective which is as yet scarcely recognized. Namely, the first analy- sis should be of economic movements and structures, of social relation-</page><page sequence="3">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 117 ships and more profoundly still of biological facts. In these, much more than in the class struggle, must we seek the motive force in the history of the popular masses, at least during our period and for the sampling of humanity that interests us. It is true that because we are dealing with a practically motorless traditional society, or at least an extremely slowly moving one, our heresy becomes more excusable. With regard to linguistics, which some of our colleagues-non-linguists, for the most part-were prepared to crown queen of the social sciences, we will not deny its immense contributions. But the subject is, alas, not in the realm of our specialization. In spite of all the interest in studies devoted to vocabulary, I must admit frankly that up to now, by pure personal inclination, I have taken more time to study the "things" that are beyond words, than to study the words themselves-particularly when the "things" refracted by the archives are in part collective representa- tions which, being based on fact, defy mere verbal expression. I have in mind, for example, landed property. Perhaps also, since we are speaking of words, I resemble those nineteenth-century semi-illiterates of Jacques Ozouf: I've spent too long learning to count to find time to learn to read. For purely disciplinary reasons which in no way imply discrimination or contempt, the underlying geological formations interest me more than the fascinating geography of verbal expression obviously essential to any history of culture in a strict sense. The hills and valleys, the very convolutions of human discourse need not concern us directly except as a mapping or archaeological expedition, prelimi- nary to deeper soundings. (The two forms of prospecting- archaeological and geological-depend, for that matter, on techniques of digging and sifting that could come to resemble one another very closely.) The science of ethnology, on the other hand, will always remain one of my favorite companions. But I have to admit that the historian, in most cases, practices that discipline in the humblest fashion. For us with file cards in hand, it is a matter of patiently questioning the documents that emerge from the social depths. This is done in much the same way as the ethnologist fills his notebooks by patiently ques- tioning the natives. And yet the moment we pass to a higher place, to the great theoretical constructions of functionalist or structuralist anthropology, yesterday's history or today's sociology often finds itself ill equipped to apply these comprehensive theories in full measure. In fact, through the exercise of a profession whose very objectives have repeatedly been called into question, a few years of teaching in our French universities have sufficed to convince me of the vanity of the integral functionalism so dear to the heart of Bronislaw Malinowsky. Naturally, it has happened that from time to time during the course of these years something has functioned in our history department. But even so! Censier was not Melanesia; nor Jussieu, the Trobriand Islands. Malinowsky's quasi pre-established harmonies, suitable for a Pacific</page><page sequence="4">118 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY atoll, proved inadequate on a campus of reinforced concrete with a population susceptible to "anomie-." The same holds true, no doubt, with regard to many other aspects of modern society; however, one might say that, if our universities seem at times to have been divested of some of their functions, they have nonetheless managed to preserve their structures. Was my professional experience, which hopelessly alienated me from functionalism, going to reconcile me to structuralism? Frankly, my choice of this point of view was made quite a long while ago and no particular scientific or personal incentive was required to effect such a rapprochement. I am one who has much admired the efficacy of struc- turalist methods as applied so successfully to the study of the rules of kinship or to the mythologies of the New World. Unfortunately, these methods cannot always be integrally reproduced or transposed among the different sectors of our own European past. Because Nathan Wachtel was working on South America, he has been able to apply the techniques of Levi-Strauss to the remote, and sometimes recent, history of Peruvian societies at the level of mythology, institutions and family structures. Conversely, among the human groups of our continent, whether traditional or contemporary, the rules of marriage, with certain fascinating exceptions, and leaving aside the persistence of certain endogamous practices at the village level, are either too open or too fluid to permit the uncritical use of the kinship diagrams devised by the new anthropology. The computers themselves break their very sharp teeth in the attempt. In the last analysis, the historian will have some difficulty in accepting the literalness of the structuralist technique relat- ing to the exchange of "signs," because in the present state of research the technique is more useful elsewhere. He will apply to himself first of all the general definition of the doctrine expressed in simple terms as "a method as old as knowledge which is intended to apprehend phenom- ena independent of their conscious manifestation, and to systematize their relationship and general transformations proceeding from a small number of variables."2 For more than a half century-from Marc Bloch to Pierre Goubert-the best French historians, systematic systematizers, have practiced structuralism, deliberately or sometimes unconsciously, but too often without being understood. In this review of interdisciplinary contacts, it is not inappropriate to point out what the investigations of an historical demographer, such as I claim to be, can contribute to the understanding of psychology and, more particularly, to psychoanalysis. This branch of knowledge is actually too close to the preserves of the historian to be rejected out of hand. In truth, my efforts along this disputed frontier have borne rather modest fruit. Naturally, I am unable to offer anything comparable to the fertile discoveries of Alain Besangon in this area. On two occasions, however, my path has approached-at a much lower level-the route</page><page sequence="5">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 119 staked out long ago by Sigmund Freud. In my studies on birth control, I have inevitably encountered the evidence provided on that subject by the young Viennese doctor in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. In fact, during his interviews with his patients, he directed his attention to the beginnings of birth control among the upper classes of the Austrian capital. And from this perspective, he analyzed the psychological traumas apparently experienced by the individuals in question as a result of their first resort to such practices-traumas per- haps explained by the primitive and unsatisfactory character of the contraceptive techniques then in use-if we accept the argument in vogue at that time. For a modern psychologist, the work of Freud on these problems is perhaps out of date, but, for the historian of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century France who is not oversupplied with documents of this kind, these Freudian texts are among the most incisive in the meager body of records we possess. For that matter-still in connection with questions of social deviation-the history of popular religions in a rural or urban setting has drawn our attention to the convulsionaries of the Cevennes and of Saint Medard (Huguenots in the one case, Jansenists in the other.) Here again, no matter how old-fashioned these studies may appear to today's scholars, the early works of Freud and Breuer on convulsive hysteria have suggested some interesting hypotheses concerning the sexual and cultural etiology of the convulsionary hysterias of the good old days. In these cases we have stayed with the early Freud before his discovery of the Oedipus complex-with the man of the Letters to Fliess and the Studies on Hysteria. Our researches invoke only Freud's early works, and then only occasionally. Thus, they will seem of seconday importance in the eyes of the true specialists. These studies testify to the limits of our historical knowledge, more than to the relevance of the Freudian analysis in the development of our discipline-a relevance which, to tell the truth, I personally feel incap- able of determining. In this connection, I remember my stupefaction, a dozen years ago, when the vigorous voice of Louis Althusser awakened us from our (antidogmatic) reveries in the archives with the illuminating announement that Marx was never young. So, with respect to the founder of psychoanalysis from our historian's point of view, exactly the opposite is true. Because of the specific character of our researches, we have only been concerned with the youthful works of the Master of Vienna, and, for us, Sigmund Freud will never grow old, actually will never even reach maturity. At this point in my lecture, I should like to borrow a phrase that Roland Barthes initially applied to other scholarly guilds. We historians constitute, in reality, the rear guard of the avant-garde. We leave to researchers in the more sophisticated disciplines the task of carrying out the dangerous reconnaissance missions. It is their business, sometimes at</page><page sequence="6">120 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY the risk of their lives, to detonate the mine-fields that are holding up the general advance. We historians simply help ourselves to the riches previously accumulated by such fields as economics, demography, and even econometrics, already dedicated to quantitative knowledge. We shamelessly pillage the resources of demography which, thanks to our efforts to make more than honorable amends, has been transformed into historical demography. We plunder the substance of Marxist and Ricardian-Malthusian economics and current economic theory; nor do we overlook cultural anthropology, which from our point of view is surer in its methods than in its achievements. In approaching a subject as relatively well defined as traditional society, biological models such as those proposed by Wynne Edwards sometimes turn out to be of more help than the latest refinements of the science of semiology whose peculiar idiom, I confess, I am not always able to decipher. At the same time, not being afflicted with the itch of up-to-the-minute modernity, we are left with the feeling of being heir to a tradition. The school of the Annales, following a long period of gestation, was born, as everybody knows, in the late 1920s with Lucien Fevre and Marc Bloch. Beginning in the 1930s Ernest Labrousse, on the heels of Francois Simiand, provided it with its quantitative coloration. Fernand Braudel (whom I have the honor of succeeding at this institution), and, in his wake, so many others who are teaching today in Paris, Rennes, Toulouse, Aix-en-Provence, etc., have endowed this increasingly poly- centric group with its unofficial legitimacy. The School, like the soci- eties it studies, is slow moving. It defines its duration in the life span of our own century. Like an old mole burrowing deeply in the ground, it does not willingly abandon its subterranean tunnels, and it displays a quite remarkable indifference to surface phenomena. Let the blood of epistemological combat flow, let skirts fall to the ankle or rise above the knee: the intrepid Annales historian refuses to be distracted from his interminable calculations. So much for those who doubt that his- tory participates in the cumulative efforts of the exact sciences. History is attentive, therefore, to the world we live in, but it recoils from the dictates of passing fashion be it ready-to-wear or haute couture. We can gain an idea of the revolutionary impact of quantitative methods in history from Fogel and Engerman's latest book on the economics of black slavery in the United States. May I be allowed for a moment, therefore, to plead the cause of this study? It is based on a series of statistical samplings drawn from censuses and plantation accounts. It is also based on calculations that would have been impos- sible without the aid of a computer. For this reason, the book's conclu- sions seem all the more paradoxical and shocking-so much so that a superficial or disingenuous reader might be tempted to view it as a disguised apology of the institution of slavery. In reality the two authors, fervid partisans of today's Black Liberation movement, have primarily succeeded in proving that one of the worst periods of the</page><page sequence="7">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 121 ex-slaves began with their so-called emancipation. After long and patient research, they have also concluded that, in the last analysis, the disguised racism of the abolitionists was almost as deadly as the brazen discrimination practiced by the plantation owners before 1860. Pioneers of counter-factual history, Fogel and Engerman have not even hesitated to calculate the price of slaves in 1889 if there had been no Civil War (it would have risen, of course). Directly, without hesitation, but with statistics well in hand, the two authors have demonstrated that slavery in North America was a highly profitable system under existing conditions; that is, that it was anything but moribund, no matter what was being said of it in the pre-Civil War years and that it proved to be even more efficient than the modes of production in the Northern States which were, of course, based on free labor. According to Fogel and Engerman, the enslaved Blacks of the South could be very effective skilled workers, often suited to urban trades no less than to country toil. In the great majority of cases, they tried to lead a normal family life. The material living conditions of these Blacks (but not, to be sure, their psychological condition as human beings deprived of their free- dom) were comparable to those of the white working class in the same region; thus, the exploitation of the work force by the southern em- ployers was not necessarily excessive. The South, in 1860, was an eco- nomically advanced country-almost a nation despite its odious archaism in the field of human relations. Actually, its economic per- formance, which is strictly quantifiable, placed the South well in ad- vance of European countries like France and Belgium. Indeed, contrary to the popular stereotype which pictures it as a backward area in almost every respect, the old antebellum South only lagged behind England and the Northern States, the two most developed regions in the world. In embarking on this perilous demonstration, Fogel and Engerman do not propose to justify or to rehabilitate the dreadful institution of slavery in the slightest. They content themselves in all simplicity with drawing attention to the fact that their predecessors, though inspired by the best intentions in the world, were bad historians to the extent that they followed the reasoning of the abolitionist press. The lesson should not be lost on young and not-so-young European economic historians like me. If we refuse to assimilate the most sophisticated elements of economic theory, our French school of research runs the risk of finding itself one day in possession of a slightly overvalued capital of historial knowledge. Having considered matters of general orientation, I come to the subject of the course itself, namely a certain traditional, rural society from the end of the Middle Ages to the beginning of the eighteenth century. From many points of view, this really constitutes a single subject whose measurable dimensions always tend to return to a con- stant upper limit despite important fluctuations.</page><page sequence="8">122 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY Certainly, I do not pretend that the "France" of the 1300s or 1700s formed an organic unity within the quasi-hexagonal frontiers of the age of Vauban. This particular, not yet French, France is nothing more than a window open to the world, thanks to which it is possible for us to single out an important sampling of humanity for study. Around 1700, at the time of the Vauban census, it numbered between 19 and 20 million inhabitants, whom we shall call "French" for the sake of convenience. Now it happens that the very numerous national and regional studies centered on the Etat des feux of 1328 indicate that these same frontiers enclosed at least 17 million souls during this period 1300 to 1340. Of course, the frontiers, being non-existent at the time, constitute no more than a convenient fiction for our purposes. In four centuries, the population only increased by 2 million persons in all! And some say less! We French were never so close (except perhaps during the years 1865-1945) to that zero population growth that the demographers are so desperately lauding without being able to bring it about. It is true that the means to which the system involuntarily resorted in order to achieve self-stabilization do not particularly recom- mend themselves to our own age. I have in mind, for example, epi- demics: they were in actuality an integral part of the ecological system which united man to his biological, bacillary and predatory environ- ment. The model that I am considering here is simply eco- demographical and factual; it does not claim to be either normative or attractive. Another set of discoveries that has recently influenced the French historical school concerns the stability of agrarian techniques and cereal yields between the first agricultural revolution (eleventh through thir- teenth centuries) and the second (which occurred belatedly in the nine- teenth century). We can also state that in general the production of basic needs proceeded according to stable norms between 1300 and 1720 by ignoring for the moment the rather ambiguous case of the eighteenth century. Thus, an extraordinary ecological equilibrium is revealed. Of course, it did not exclude possibly prodigious, but always temporary, upheavals and negative fluctuations in its time like those experienced by animal populations. No less susceptible to "technical adjustments" and fits of humor than the equilibria of the economists, this general equilibrium can be summed up by the following landscape portrait: inside the leafy confines of the encircling forests spared by the great land colonization movement of the eleventh to thirteenth cen- turies, a peasant population from 1300 to 1700-20, during the course of twelve or thirteen generations, was busy reproducing itself within the limits of certain finite possibilities whose constraints proved inexorable. These constraints might be attenuated after 1720. They would not disappear all that soon: as late as 1914, on the eve of the First World War, the active French farming population remained very close to its maximum figures of 1850. To return to the crucial period 1320-1720,</page><page sequence="9">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 123 the long-run near stability of the demographic and agricultural yeild parameters furnishes the occasion for a dialogue with the last-ditch defenders of an a priori conceptualization. In the present case, statistics are not merely the sulky handmaidens of a concept which would not scruple to send them packing if they refuse to do its bidding. On the contrary, it is from the evidence of the figures themselves that the concept emerges. It leads straight back to the old notions concerning the potentialities of a virtually motionless state. This ecologically stable society which was also almost stable demo- graphically had not always possessed these two qualities to the same degree, not at least during an earlier phase. From the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, it had experienced a long-term period of genuine expansion characterized by extensive land clearing and a great boom in population. The expansion in question had occurred in a world of decentralized political authority. It was a piecemeal movement carried out under the aegis of the feudal nobility. Everything considered, this old medieval world proved extremely conducive to the truly prodigious development of rural society-prodigious, in any event, when compared to the protracted periods of stagnation of the four long centuries that followed. From the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, what was good for feudalism was good for western Europe as a whole, and more especially good for the populations of that France of the future which will serve as our historical laboratory. Only after 1300 would the for- mation of the great centralized monarchies (a development that, of course, had begun much earlier) end by creating the conditions of national conflict which would prove to be one of the most effective impediments to expansion and would contribute, along with a host of other factors, to the shipwreck of the Gothic Middle Ages. After 1300 to about 1720-from Philip the Fair to John Law's system, or from an unhealthy monetary inflation to a healthy one-the days of innocent and carefree development were definitely over. Having previously enjoyed the experience of increasing reproduction, society and the entire ecological system, that is, nature plus agriculture, fauna and bacillary flora plus the human species, changed. Henceforth the system proved capable-at least as far as the human beings in our geog- raphical sampling were concerned-of secreting certain inhibiting or remedial mechanisms which blocked the upswing and turned the tide, or else-periodically and painfully-restored the human collectivity to its previous position of equilibrium. Only in the preliminary analysis does that process of normalization imply the existence of exogenous braking forces; it would be easy to show that what is exogenous with respect to Europe is endogenous with respect to Eurasia and also, begin- ning in the sixteenth century, to the Atlantic World as a whole. Be that as it may, by virtue of its gradual increase in population and trading activity, in commercial, colonial, religious and military contacts from the eleventh century on, the expanding European galaxy ended by</page><page sequence="10">124 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY rubbing shoulders, albeit at a distance, with other nebulas which were no less extensive and were indeed expanding on their own account: the Chinese beginning in the thirteenth century and the American Indian beginning in the sixteenth. With reference to the former, from the fourteenth century, the malefic regions of Central Asia, swarming with infected rats and plague-bearing fleas, were traversed without serious hindrance by silk caravans and by far-ranging Mongol armies, thanks to the political and commercial pacification realized by the conquering khans. Stimulated by the increasing peregrinations of the germ carriers, a common market of microbes and viruses was thus allowed to develop, first in the Eurasian, then in the Atlantic World. To universal dismay, this common market of contagion continues to function right up to our own day. It set the stage for microbian short-circuits on a scale incon- ceivable prior to 1300. Among these, first place is occupied by the Black Death of 1348 whose after-effects would continue to haunt "la douce France" down to the last plague outbreak at Marseille in 1720. At least equal billing after 1492 or 1532 should be accorded the much more terrible genocide of the American Indian provoked by the infec- tious diseases introduced-dare one say not in all innocence-by the conquistadors of Castille. This was accompanied by a deadly counter- offensive affecting the demography of our own continent: syphilis. But it was nothing more than a quid pro quo and by no means comparable to the genocide of the New World that the Latin countries had ex- ported to Mexico and to Peru. In both cases, in the fourteenth as in the sixteenth centuries, the responsible, readily identifiable agents of inter- national pollution were literally if not deliberately set in motion. May I be permitted, in the perspective of a history more concerned with events, to point out in passing the pernicious role of the Genoese? They were twice guilty: first because of their role as leaders in organizing the trans-Asiatic silk caravans terminating at their trading station of Caffa in the Crimea whence the plague took ship for the West and second, because of the presence of one of their most distinguished citizens, Christopher Columbus, at the head of the original conquista. To a great city and a great port, the honor of setting off great pandemics! The microbian unification of the world-accomplished not with- out havoc-between 1300 and 1650 was one of the most powerful stabilizing factors in the ecological system that existed during those times. But needless to say, the process of normalization was realized through a series of oscillations from positive to negative and vice versa. These movements were immense at first (I have in mind the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries), then gradually diminished. France contained at the very least 17 million inhabitants within her conventional bound- aries around 1320. We might say that at most she numbered less than 10 million around 1440. But during the course of the "long seventeenth century" (c. 1560-1715) the late medieval figure of 17 million was equalled and indeed improved upon, with the number of human beings</page><page sequence="11">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 125 fluctuating in the neighborhood of 19 to 20 million, through alter- nating periods of scarcity and plenty. The microbian unification of humanity was not, however, the only limiting factor in operation. A second and formidable factor at work from the fourteenth to the early eighteenth century was war, and beyond that, the modern or would-be modern State. In a larger sense, I wish to invoke here the international state-system because it was against this background that the different phases of bellicosity affecting the entire western world emerge. In the earlier period (the eleventh-thirteenth centuries), when armed hostilities rent the seamless, closeknit robe of old style feu- dalism, there was every chance of these conflicts remaining localized. Only limited areas of the fabric were damaged and these, given the circumstances, were quite readily repaired. The situation changed com- pletely with the emergence of the great national monarchies. Driven by a sort of internal logic, the big states were ruled by demonstrably short-sighted individuals with big appetites but little imagination, who regularly embarked on international wars that they were incapable of ending and that were likely to last thirty years, a hundred years, etc. Such wars were not necessarily very lethal in themselves. After all, their direct killing power emanated from an army whose permanent ranks for a long period of time did not ordinarily exceed 10,000 men (the 500,000-man army of the later part of Louis XIV's reign being a notable exception). The destructive effects of the presence of small bands of "armed ruffians" were more often indirect. War, in fact, spread the epidemics carried by the typhoid lice and plague fleas that infested soldiers, refugees, vagabonds and beggars who were so numer- ous in times of conflict. During the course of a promenade concocted by Richelieu, a single little army of 8,000 men crossed France from one end to the other-from La Rochelle to Montferrat.3 Now, the plague pandemic alone, propagated by that tiny force beginning in 1627-8, caused the death of a million people who probably never suspected that this was the price of the Cardinal's policy to reduce the Protestants to obedience. War, moreover, had other side effects. By requisitioning work steers and horses, by pillaging, by the destruction of grain mills and farms, and by the firing of barns full of grain, war could literally annihilate agricultural capital. Added to these were inopportune panics which, during the season of such indispensable farm tasks as sowing, ploughing or harvesting, drove the frightened work force to seek refuge behind the closed ramparts of the town. For this reason the class of cultivators, bled white and ruined, sometimes found themselves "de- kulakized," that is, reduced to the status of rural proletarians. This process alone would have sufficed to render the simple stabilization of the Old Regime's economy and its eco-demography impossible in cer- tain circumstances. Phenomena of this sort occurred in Normandy around 1430 and contributed to reducing by three quarters the area of</page><page sequence="12">126 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY land settlement compared to the pre-Hundred Years War period.4 Guy Bois is quite right in this connection to speak of a "Hiroshima-like model." By themselves, then-in the age of Joan of Arc-war, plague, famines and epidemics had much more serious consequences than did the depression per se-that depression whose effects are easily exagger- ated in narrow out-dated economic terms. Together, these four horse- men of the Apocalypse led to the prodigious, if momentary, depopula- tion of France in the fifteenth century. Or rather, more precisely, we might say that the late medieval economic depression was bound up in a web o factors and variables in which the depression was at the same time cause and effect, but, with everything considered, it was more the latter than the former. Following the great renaissance or reconstitution of the French population (1440-1560), in the period that stretches from 1560 to 1715, war with its accompanying famine and pestilence was once again one of the principal regulating factors. It caused our eco-demographic system to level off, even to decline briefly between recoveries. For confirmation, it is sufficient to consult the large-scale study of tithe revenues which I owe to Joseph Goy's collaboration.5 Three major periods of deceleration, naturally accompanied by terrible suffering, are discernible on our combined curves. They correspond, approximately, to the Religious Wars (1560-1595), the Thirty Years War and the wars of the Fronde (1635-1653), and the wars of the late reign of Louis XIV (1690-1715). To invoke war as a Malthusian check is of course to invoke the permanent army, that foundation of future bureaucracies. In this way, we are also led to incriminate the "modern" state-monarchial, presum- ably absolutist, but most certainly bureaucratic, repressive, and a pur- veyor of "offices." It managed to get itself organized between the fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries and to dominate the land- scape, a little too much even if we are to trust the politico-centric descriptions of an older historiography. Now, the ambiguities of this monarchy vis-a-vis our present subject, the eco-demographic system, are profound: from a Weberian point of view, the state in question appears first of all as a modernizing force. In fact, owing to what Pierre Chaunu does not hesitate to call its technostructure, it was capable of stimulat- ing certain economic, cultural and social developments. But from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century, this growth function was often eclipsed by a stabilizing function. If we turn to Pierre Goubert's latest work on the Ancien Rdgime,6 we shall see that the absolutist monarchy was, in very large measure, a military institution, itself involved in the European state system. It devoured more than half of its own budget to support an army which was to become in many ways the nation's undoing-infinitely more so than the court of Versailles would ever be. The state and the army between 1315 and 1715 were to be counted among the principal regulators of an eco-demographic system that bred</page><page sequence="13">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 127 them and upon which they in turn fed. It is not a question of subscrib- ing to the Panglossian view that all is for the best: and just as melons are formed of sections the better to be consumed at the family table, so western society was fated to saddle itself with Moloch states dedicated to mutual vilification and charged with organizing a holocaust every thirty years in order to achieve a healthful leveling off of their respec- tive populations and provide their loyal subjects with a taste of the joys of equilibrium. This teleological and polemical point of view presented here in the guise of a demon to be exorcized continues to be alien to me. I simply wanted to emphasize the fact that the long equilibrium which seems to characterize my subject, was fully achieved only in tragic circumstances, that is to say through politics and, therefore, through war. After all, in the animal world too, the ecological system implies the presence of predators. The wars of seventeenth-century France were directly responsible for the deaths they caused, but they were, also, indirectly responsible for the crises and suffering provoked by wartime taxes. Consider, for example, the misfortunes of the last days of Louis XIV's reign. In fact, the state would not fully assume its modern economically expansive and beneficient functions until a dialectical (for want of a better adjective) turning point around 1715 that ushered in an age of gentlemanly warfare, enlightened administrators and statistically minded bureaucrats. The Age of the Enlightenment was also the period of the flowering of our demographic upswing of the eighteenth century to which, for the permanent edification of future generations, the French Revolution of 1789 gave a final boost despite the fact that the wars of 1792-1815 sometimes had a temporarily opposite effect. The foregoing reflections on the state lead me to insist upon what might be termed one of the paradoxes of modernization. On several occasions, the state, war and the army with their horde of afflictions led the Nation to the edge of an abyss in the name of policy; however, at the same time it is true that this action, by dreadful Malthusian checks, regulated and avoided the pangs of an unthinking increase of the human population. This policy of brinkmanship applies also to the major innovations of the sixteenth century. It is necessary to recall that the great mass of the French people, excepting a small elite, lived in a world of relative cultural stability from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century and even beyond: they chattered to one another in their own dialects and remained faithful to a semi-folkloristic Catholicism which formed the basis of their religiosity. The irruption of the Protestant Reformation, based on the printed word and the spread of literacy among a small minority of the population, in such a setting unleashed furious reactions. It was not easy to graft a Huguenot heart to a body that still considered itself to be entirely Catholic. When one presumes to deprive village dwellers of the cult of the saints and the Virgin Mary,</page><page sequence="14">128 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY which were the anthropomorphic heirs of the naturalism and fetishism syncretized from pagan worship, a backlash must be expected. A defen- sive and punitive reaction of both rejection and panic swept through the nation from 1560 to 1685; that is to say, until the final triumph of the tradition of papal influence ["tradition papiste "] -newly refurbished by the Counter-Reformation-and the derisory rediscovery of religious unity achieved by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. In its opening phase, from 1560 to 1595, the Catholic reaction was incredibly violent. By identifying itself with the backlash of the religious wars and provok- ing a dangerous rupture of great magnitude in the eco-demographic system, it constituted one of the most powerful stabilizing forces in our system. It clearly broke the Renaissance expansion, until then uncon- trolled, in which men multiplied like rats in a haystack or mice in a barn. Once more, and in recoil from it, the attempt at modernization contributed in the last analysis to a strengthening of the repressive and unchanging character of the system which after 1600 emerged from its ordeal stitched with noble battle scars but fundamentally unchanged. To be sure, it would be absurd and even stupid to explain every- thing in terms of war; it only provides the final means, the ultima ratio of our system. As we have seen during the course of that very long seventeenth century, war only entered the picture on three occasions and was interrupted by phases of respite. In all, there were 80 years of belligerency as against 80 years of peace or at least relative peace at home. Therefore, we are forced to admit that there also existed a purely peaceful routine of stabilizing factors, side by side with the upheavals of war. This particular routine was assured by epidemics alone. The fine work of Frangois Lebrun on Anjou7 has made an important contribution to this problem. Lebrun was concerned with a rather exceptional case. In the eighteenth century, an age in which the nation as a whole was caught up in a great wave of demographic expan- sion marked by an increase in the total population from 19 to 27 million inhabitants, selected enclaves nevertheless remained subject to the old stabilizing forces. Among these were Brittany and most espe- cially Anjou, the latter completely trapped (although not without a struggle) at the stage of zero population growth between 1700 and 1789. Its demographically stagnant condition had nothing whatsoever to do with war: Anjou was far removed from the theatres of military operations. Under Louis XIV, Louis XV and Louis XVI, it was spared the effects of armed conflict and also of famine after 1710. Hence one must look elsewhere for an explanation of its demographic stagnation. Francois Lebrun has shown convincingly that a communicable disease was primarily responsible for the failure of the Anjou population to grow. In prosaic terms, every time there was even a hint of demographic progress in that sanitationless province whose people drank the polluted waters of the Loire, almost immediately an epidemic of amoebic dysentery broke out that dispatched thousands of individuals to their</page><page sequence="15">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 129 graves and halted the budding population boom in its tracks. With all due respect for the Angevin character, it is necessary to point out that this primitive and cruel form of self-regulation is also to be found in the domain of animal demography, and in particular among the higher apes, the animals closest to man. Among groups of insular apes studied by a British zoologist,8 dysentery rages when the simian population in- creases and when, for that reason, infectious contacts between the ever more numerous individuals multiply. In contrast, the disease subsides when the animals, reduced in number as a result of the last epidemic, can afford the luxury of relative isolation which more or less protects them from excessively murderous contacts. Then, almost immediately the simian ranks begin to fill up again to the point of provoking the next outbreak of disease which is destined to restore the original situa- tion, and so on. Dysentery, in other words, is to the human population of eighteenth-century Anjou or to the ape population of the islands what the safety valve was to Watt's steam engine. Does this pathogenic potential we have just described invalidate the proposition (in vogue for at least the last three decades) that, under the Old Regime, the principal modulator of population levels in both the countryside and the city was hunger? We do not believe this to be the case. The famines of the seventeenth century, which fortunately diminished after 1741, were terrible in their effects. However, the most recent studies remind us that famine should not be considered out of context. It functioned as part of a general social condition. It was a consequence of wars which, with their hardship, suffering, and taxes, impoverished the people, thus setting the stage for devastating famine cycles.9 It was a short-term cause of epidemics which it helped to provoke in two ways: first by creating a climate favorable to general undernourishment; second, by spreading across the country a host of starving beggars who carried with them infectious germs. Famine, then, appears to me, as another "last resort" whose horrors were not usually needed to maintain the supreme law of the demographic equilibrium. Normally, long before the reduction of food supplies to famine levels, exogenous and endogenous regulators (plagues, wars, epidemics, late marriage) were already at work. They damped down the fires of demo- graphic expansion before it was too late. They were even capable of provoking violent negative fluctuations on their own. Urban phenomena also, suspect a priori of "modernism," were paradoxically enlisted by the forces of restraint in the preservation of zero population growth as late as the eighteenth century. In a small village of the Paris region, 142 Parisian infants boarded out with wet nurses died in a single year. And, in the same village, there is an even more incredible incident which Marcel Lachiver called to my attention. During a single intergenetic period of thirty months, 31 babies from the city were entrusted, one after another, to a single-perhaps tubercular- couple in this same village, the wife being a professional wet nurse. All</page><page sequence="16">130 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY these infants died within a few weeks of each other. Here we are in the presence of an extreme and teratological case of organized or, at best, irresponsible infanticide. But that tragic experience serves to remind us that our great urban centers of the classic age, however glittering they appeared, really deserve the nickname of graveyard cities. In other words, they functioned as safety valves for the release of excess demo- graphic pressure by absorbing the human surplus of the rural exodus and later on by condemning a large portion of that surplus to death or sterility. For this purpose they relied on galloping consumption, infan- ticidal wet nurses and the permanent celibacy or late marriage of count- less country girls. (See, in this connection, Maurice Garden's study on Lyons in the eighteenth century.10) The picture I have painted might seem to be excessively negative even supposing (and it is not the case) that there is an implied value judgment. In the matter of population control it is true that more gentle procedures of demographic control based on contraception were not much in vogue during the four centuries under consideration. The long-standing semi-religious, semi-anthropoligical taboo against coitus interruptus which bore so heavily on western countries did not begin to disappear among the wealthy classes until the eighteenth century. As far as the peasants were concerned, this taboo was only gradually lifted starting at the time of the French Revolution which, as we know, from this point of view, constituted a sort of demographic Islam.' 1 The data relative to late marriage are more important at first glance, with regard to our period. According to Pierre Chaunu12 this practice represented "the contraceptive weapon par excellence of seventeenth-century Europe." In fact, the late marriage of women at 25 or 26 years of age made it possible to avoid as many as three or four births provided that marriage was preceded by a phase of strict pre- conjugal abstinence. A supplementary advantage: such a practice, im- plying a state of celibacy that was fully observed right up to the mar- riage night, was marvelously in harmony with the Puritan and Jansenist ideologies of austerity which flourished everywhere in pre-industrial Europe between 1580 and 1780. Their cheerless message, if one is to believe Max Weber, would later serve as counterpoint to the rise of the petty bourgeois or capitalist spirit. But from the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries, perhaps for want of a better object, they were employed "on the job," so to speak, to justify during almost a decade of virginal continence the chaste discipline expected of young people from puberty to marriage. To get married in the village under the Old Regime, it was in fact necessary, it seems, to wait chastely for a very long time, and first to acquire or inherit a house in which to settle down. This notion of late marriage is historically attractive. It is con- nected, as we have seen, with the old Weberian analysis relating to the ascetic personality. It is also associated with the discoveries of the</page><page sequence="17">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 131 ethnologists and biologists who, in the wake of Wynne Edwards, encountered numerous anti-populationist procedures in human and animal societies which might be based, for example, on the limitation of nest building in the case of birds. Thus, there would appear to be a general theory of systems of demographic control equally valid for man and beast. It would be bad grace on my part to question the importance of similar comparisons because, since I am as interdisciplinary as the next man, I have perhaps contributed to their elaboration. And yet, the most recent researches concerning the levelling off of the human popu- lation of the Old Regime favor an interpretation that diverges some- what from the preceding one. They emphasize, in fact, the role of mortality in population control rather than conscious regulation based on asceticism, let alone contraception. (See, in this connection, the math- ematical models of Jacques Dupiquier which leave little room for late marriage as a factor influencing the level of population.)13 The theoreticians of the stationary state have defined it as one of perpetual movement, tending toward a median state, and finally, essen- tially reproducing certain basic traits of the initial state. This theory of reproduction is also valid for our rural eco-system. Despite the enor- mous transformation of certain superstructures, the system in itself remained to the end (on the eve of the famines of the Fronde and those of 1693 or 1709) very much what it had been three and a half or four centuries earlier prior to the famine of 1315. In the meantime, the principal parameters-demographic, ecological, even sociological-had oscillated, but they had not really changed: "plus qa bouge, plus c'est la mime chose." In both cases, whether 1320 or 1680, a rural population whose overall numbers continued to hover around the same general norm was busy scratching out a livelihood with practically timeless techniques and with yields that were consistently too poor to prevent hundreds of thousands of people from dying every thirty years or so from the direct or indirect effects of hunger. The system, in fact, was operating close to capacity in both periods and under conditions con- ducive to subsistence crises and to short-circuiting epidemics. The eco- logical disasters that resulted were capable of reducing the system to its simplest expression in terms of population and land under cultivation (as, for example, around 1430 and, in a much less serious way, around 1695 or 1711). But such vicissitudes did not prevent subsequent re- covery in line with the previously established, intrinsic norms. To be sure, the process of reconstruction or rebirth was accompanied by change, which, as long as it remained compatible with the internal logic of the system as a whole, could assume a certain scope. One of these transformations concerns the dominant and commercialized sector of agriculture which was embodied, as we know, in the demesne land. This land, particularly when rented, became, paradoxically, a carrier of cap- italist modernization. The aforesaid modification operated on various</page><page sequence="18">132 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY levels. First, the growth of the state and the process of urbanization stripped the lord of some of his roles. Very often in the seventeenth century he was a political or judicial official in name only. He also lost some of his functions as a petty tribal chief within the village. His former, almost sovereign, prerogatives passed to the king's representa- tives or to the urban bureaucracies. In the second place, commercializa- tion and urbanization (once again! ) enhanced the importance of the demesne lands which produced a surplus of cereals and livestock, whereas the peasant smallholders were condemned to subsistence farm- ing. Without betraying its own nature, between the Middle Ages and the eighteenth century, manorialism tended, therefore, to become less and less feudalistic and more and more capitalistic-or at least physiocratic. The seigneurial reaction in the Age of Enlightenment was reactionary as to form, but profit-oriented as to content-to such a degree, in fact, that the pro-smallholding peasant revolution of 1789 would be a retro- grade movement from an economic point of view. But enough of these nuances and imperfections which in any case come in part after the historical subject under study-on the whole, the dominant impression up to 1720, is one of stability: after all, agricul- tural yields per acre scarcely improved during our period. Precisely because of this low productivity the cities always required quite exten- sive surrounding areas of large estates or demesne lands to guarantee their own susbsistence. Whatever modifications might occur between 1300 and 1720, they did not change the semi-smallhold, semi-landed estate character of the mode of production which continued to dom- inate our rural world from the beginning to the end of the period. Near stability is not the same as immobility. I have been consider- ing here a certain enduring drift, but there are also purely internal oscillations and fluctuations in the system. Wilhelm Abel, in the wake of David Ricardo, studied the rhythm of these long-term movements.14 Abel was fascinated by the effects that the changing relationship between fluctuating population and available land had on social struc- tures. He introduces us to a sort of crisscross of variables: high land rent, low wages, dispersed holdings at the beginning of the fourteenth century; land consolidation, sumptuous salaries and a five-day week, low rents that reduced landlords to "gangsterisme" in the period 1350-1450; repopulation, the renewed breakup of land holdings, hard times for wage workers and good times for the rentier and bourgeois classes in the sixteenth century. Then again, beginning at various dates in the seventeenth century, rising wages, the consolidation of landed property and, most important of all, the leveling off of land rent. Should we invoke here, with reference to monetary movements, the rise or decline of the Bolivian silver mines? As a matter of fact, a recent study based on neutron activation analysis would tend rather to minimize the influence of the monetary factor on long-term economic developments.15 Technological innovations, for their part, also play a</page><page sequence="19">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 133 minor role in the genesis of successive equilibria described by Abel. These equilibria mark the limits of advance and retreat-the flux and reflux of depression and recovery-much more than they indicate periods of true growth or irreversible decline. The major economic fluctuations observed by Abel are the long- term consequence of the great fits and starts of the population move- ment. They depend in the final analysis-and allowing for all kinds of mediating forces-on biological factors and on the rhythm of disease cycles, and are to a much greater degree molded by them than by the supposed or actual repercussions of changing living standards. For this reason, they are much more Ricardian than Malthusian. In this connec- tion, may I be allowed to join my slightly discordant voice to the very Parisian chorus of the critics of economic determinism? From the four- teenth to the seventeenth century, the economy was the handmaiden rather than the mistress, the follower rather than the leader. No matter how important it was in the "ground breaking" stage of our studies, in the last analysis, it proved quite subserviant to the great forces of life and death. With regard to the imperatives of politics or the class strug- gle, their time was yet to come, at least to the extent that their influ- ence was truly specific. Over this entire, lengthy period, the system we are describing was experienced as fate and was rarely called into question. The general run of peasant uprisings hardly conformed to the model of the anti-feudal struggle as illustrated by the French Jacquerie or the German peasant wars. At least in France, peasant revolts aspired above all to return to the good old days. They were opposed to change and in particular to that unpardonable "novelty"-the proliferation of royal offices and the rise of a coterie of wealthy tax farmers surrounding the still revered figure of the sovereign. Basically, the peasant revolt of the classic age, as painted in contrasting colors by Porchenev and Mousnier, constitutes a rejection of the bourgeois state, the military-financial complex and ris- ing taxes. We know that between 1605 and 1690, during the long period of major uprisings, successive turns of the fiscal screws permitted the increase from 192 to 1,050 metric tons of pure silver or its equiva- lent in royal expenditures.16 Now these desperate outbreaks were not necessarily directed against the landlords and the "feudal" nobility whose interests may nevertheless have been threatened on certain occa- sions. On the contrary, the insurgents regularly invoked the leadership of those born mediators of the peasant community: the lord, the priest and the local magistrate. It was not until the cultural revolution of the Age of the Enlightenment penetrated to the lowest stratum of the peasant masses in certain rebellious provinces, Burgundy for example, that the old anti-tax revolt became anti-landlord. One might object to this concept of motionless history with its slow or catastrophic fluctuations and involutions which I am proposing in this inaugural lecture because it is a little too negligent of such</page><page sequence="20">134 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY fundamental innovations of the period as Pascal's divine revelation, Papin's steam engine, the growth of a very great city like Paris, or the progress of civility among the upper classes as symbolized by the intro- duction of the dinner fork. Far be it from me to question the radically new character of these episodes. But what interests me here is the becoming or rather the non-becoming of the faceless masses of people. The accomplishments of the elite are situated on a higher and more isolated plane and are not really significant except from the point of view of a noisy minority, carriers of progress without doubt, but as yet incapable of mobilizing the enormous mass of rural humanity enmeshed in its Ricardian feedback. However, the ineffectiveness of the elite is only valid for the very long period prior to 1720 (I confine myself here to the French time- table since elsewhere the chronology might be different). Beyond that date, then, the forces of elitist renovation which had been building up slowly over the course of centuries ended by attaining their critical mass and setting off an avalanche. They swept our peasantry up in a process of true growth such as it had not experienced since the thir- teenth century. These renovating forces include the state, a rejuvenated Church and an educational system that was at once more repressive and more efficacious; a more abundant monetary circulation; a more sophis- ticated nobility and bourgeoisie, better estate management; the general growth of literacy; a more rational bureaucracy; intensified trade; and an urbanization movement which finally became irresistable and which obliged the peasants (whose productivity failed to increase signifi- cantly) to beget more peasants in order to nourish the supernumerary city dwellers. Wisdom or folly? In any event all of these things together finally unlocked Pandora's box. They combined to force our agricul- tural population within its eco-system to violate medieval norms that it had respected without a murmur down to the death of Louis XIV. This break with the past applies to the Age of Enlightenment and also, of course, to the following period, that is to say, to the nineteenth cen- tury. There were 17 million "Frenchmen" around 1328; and 19 million around 1700. For all practical purposes the same number! But there were 27 million in 1789 and nearly 40 million on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Elsewhere in Europe, progress proved to be even more rapid. The demographic upswing, which was accompanied by the disappearance of famine, made a certain simultaneous growth of the gross agricultural product both necessary and inevitable-this, not- withstanding the improved performance registered in the transporting and marketing of cereals and other provisions. The rise of food produc- tion must have been at least sufficient, and was probably more than sufficient, to feed the entire French population. On this particular point, therefore, I dissent from a paradoxical and brilliant study which has proved so useful up to now in helping me to define motionless history. I do not believe, in fact, that it is possible to deny the progress</page><page sequence="21">MOTIONLESS HISTORY 135 that occurred in eighteenth-century agriculture. One of the most sur- prising conclusions of the work in question is that there actually was no agrarian revolution in the very region in which it occurred, namely in the extreme north of the country. Indeed, unless it be conceded, con- trary to reason, that France numbered 27 million inhabitants as early as 1670,17 one has to admit that-if not a revolution-at least a very lively development of French agriculture must have taken place in the eighteenth century. In this connection, Michele Baulant's unpublished researches on post-mortem inventories contradict the myth of peasant impoverishment during the last century of the Old Regime (see, ' propos, the paper she presented before the last congress of French economic historians in the section dedicated to the study of consump- tion). Thus, the old material constraints which up to that time had mercilessly curbed the growth of our national Caliban were breaking down. At the same time, the foundations were being laid for a transfor- mation of mentalities. This makes it easier to understand the paradox of the militant peasantry which formed, in its turn, the chorus of a non-silent minority in the 1780s and which, for the first time, dared to dream of social equality and the abolition of certain class privileges. At the same time, however, they rose in a last victorious defense of the peasant smallhold against the progress of capitalist production as embodied in the countryside by the lord's demesne and by the "feudal reaction." In the last analysis, this ambivalent posture of Bonhomme- Misdre possesses a certain internal logic of its own. By way of conclusion, I would have liked to have emphasized the enormous debt we working historians owe to the social sciences. For lack of time, I shall have to content myself with dispelling a misconcep- tion. Up to the last century, the essence of knowledge was founded on the interaction of two parallel cultures: the exact sciences and human- ities; mathematics and intuition; the geometric spirit and the sense of nuance. History, from Thucydides to Michelet, naturally formed part of the humanities. And then there appeared on the scene, first discretely, then in full view, a "third culture"-that of the social sciences. For a long time their practioners got along well with the historians. One could observe, in the tradition of Marx and Weber, of Durkheim and Freud, a constant exchange of concepts and defectors. More recently, however, there has been an attempt to reject the dimension of past time. The social sciences, which prided themselves on their hard-nosed scientific rigor, undertook to exclude history (considered a "soft" science) from their ranks. The struggle implied a great deal of ignorance and a certain measure of malevolence on the part of the aggressors. One pretended not to know that, since Bloch, Braudel and Labrousse, history had also effected its scientific mutation. History had surprised the social sciences at the swimming hole and made off with their clothes, and the victims</page><page sequence="22">136 SOCIAL SCIENCE HISTORY had not even noticed their nakedness. Today, as far as that is con- cerned, everything suggests that these futile banishment proceedings are winding down. Everybody, by now, has been forced to admit the obvious: it is not possible to construct a science of man without a temporal dimension any more than it is. possible to construct a science of astrophysics without knowing the age of the stars and the galaxies. History, which for a few decades had fallen into semi-disgrace-the Cinderella of the social sciences-has, therefore, recovered the eminence it deserves. History had the good sense to retire at the proper moment; it refused to become a narcissistic discourse which revels in the con- templation of self and in the commemoration of its own anniversaries. And while here and there its disappearance was being heralded, it had simply passed through the looking-glass to track down the Other in the place of the Self.
