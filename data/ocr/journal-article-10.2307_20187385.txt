<plain_text><page sequence="1">187 Aeschylean ?\izyapioc and Virgilian inamabilis1 In a learned article (ZPE 78 [1989] 1-29) Albert Henrichs explains Virgil's application of the word inamabilis to the waters of the underworld (G. 4.479 and A. 6.438)2 as based upon Aeschylus' use of a^?yapTov to describe the water of the Styx (Frg. 273.11-13 A Radt).3 I offer a different proposal. The question "why did Virgil call the waters of the underworld inamabilis?' can be di vided into two: (1) why did Virgil wish to use an m-compound?, and (2) why did he think amabilitas or its lack pertinent? Henrichs has answered the first question admirably: privative compounds are typical in descriptions of the underworld in general and of Stygian waters in particular (e.g. Hades is ?t|ie?X,i%ioc T|5' ??a|iactoc at II. 9.158, and the water of the Styx ?|iei?,ncTov at h. Dem. 259; see Henrichs, 25ff.). The cogency of Henrichs1 answer to question (2), that Virgil's use of the ama-stem reflects Aeschylus' |jiy-/|ieyaip-, is, how ever, more doubtful, for the meanings of the two stems are not close. There are two possible answers to question (2): the first is that Virgil simply wanted a word meaning "hateful" and was not particularly choosy about which one. This proposal might be rendered more attractive by supposing that Virgil used inamabilis as a synonym for croyep?c, and appealed to his readers to make an etymological connection: inamabilis: cto yep?c Itt)^. The weaknesses of this suggestion are (a) that as a translation of crvyepoc inamabilis is not conspicuously superior to other Latin words for "hateful" (e.g., invisus and detestabais),4 and therefore is unlikely to have stimulated anyone to think of the Greek word; and (b) that croyep?c as a word-formation states a quality positively, when, as Henrichs has shown, the Greek tradition that inamabilis clearly reflects is that of negative formations. Ul timately, then, this first line of explication will rest on the presumption of a reduced meaning for the ama- stem in the adjective: not "un-lovable," but simply "loathsome" or the like. In support of such a reduced, non-erotic meaning is the use elsewhere in Latin of ama- com pounds (see the OLD entries for amabilis and inamabilis). This argument is two-edged, how ever. As Axelson has pointed out, amabilis is in general non-poetic; Horace, for whom it is a "Lieblingswort," uses it 7 times, more often than all other classical poetic instances com 11 wish to express my gratitude for the advice and criticisms of F.

Pelliccia bined.5 Virgil is unlikely to have used a word that is both unpoetic and, in its use elsewhere, etymologically debased, unless he had reason to believe that he could use it in such a way as to renew it. This idea of renewal leads to the second possible answer to question (2): Virgil was using the ama- stem in a strong sense, that is, one that granted full force to its amatory connotations. In what sense is the underworld palus?that is, the water of the Styx?incapable of participat ing in the activity of amorl In order to answer this question it will first be necessary to recol lect that Greco-Roman rivers, like other numinous geographic entities, enjoy a changeable status. We may distinguish three possibilities: (1) rivers conceived as personified deities; (2) rivers conceived as waters; and (3) the free interplay between (1) and (2). This last character istic, the most puzzling to the modem mind, is illustrated by the behavior of Scamander in //. 21, where first (212f.) the river takes on human appearance in order to address Achilles (?cv?pi eic?|Lievoc, ?aBerjc S' ?x ?O?y^axo Sivrjc), but later (307ff.) is able to speak to the river Simoeis without any such transformation;6 all the while Scamander remains identified with the waters inundating Achilles. Characteristics (1) and (2) will require no general illustration; I point out a possibility for paronomasia by means of which they can be combined in order to produce (3). As personi fied deities rivers are capable of sexual intercourse with humans or other anthropomorphic beings; a standard verb is |Lieiyvu|ii/p,icYC?. Thus //. 21.143: tt| yap pa \iiyx\ Tto%a\ibc ?a 0\)5?vtic. Similarly, the personified Styx herself in Hesiod Th. 383: Iti)? 8' ereic' '?icea vo? BuyaTTip n?XXavxi imye?ca ktX. Rivers conceived as waters, on the other hand, can combine with other bodies of water; the verb is again iieiyvuiii/tiicyco and compounds. This usage is too common to require exemplification, and I quote only a passage of Herodotus (7.129.2-3) which influenced Lucan in a passage to be discussed later: c?cre cov 7coTa|icov ?c a?rnv Kai 6XX(?v cu%vc?v ec?a?AovTcov, n?vie 6? t?v 5oK?p.cov n-?Xicxa TC?vSe, Unveiou Kai 'ArciSavo?

We see, then, two distinct uses of ^e?yvu^i/|i?cycu, the one sexual, the other not. What we need now is evidence for paronomasia between the two different senses. I first look at some possible instances in contexts that do not concern rivers, and then present a passage that may have been decisive for Virgil. 5 B.

What is of interest for our inquiry is Theognis' down-to-earth identification of social order with correct breeding practices; order is maintained by preserving class distinctions; class lines are identical to blood lines; blood lines are confused by cross-class breeding. The argument predicates an identification of sexual intenningling with social intermingling (?jiei^e as in line 190: "wealth brings it about that the race is mixed"), for the latter follows inevitably from the former: "thus do not marvel at the obscuring of the race." The range of meaning to be given to cumiicyeTai in 192 must be considered. The lan guage is similar to the non-sexual language of such passages as //. 24.527-531 (cf. ?|i|ii^ac in 529) and especially Hesiod Op.119 jiejie?^eTai ?c0X? KaKo?civ, where the referents of the two adjectives or adjectival substantives are unspecified, as in Thgn. 192. It is clear, how ever, that Theognis cannot have meant simply "good things are mixed with bad," which is the sort of meaning that the Hesiodic passage requires;7 nonetheless, his wording was probably influenced by traditional phraseology as evidenced in the Hesiodic line (cf. West ad loc, re ferring to Stesichorus SLG 150 i 4). The easiest noun to supply would be yevr). At any rate, since there can be no doubt but that Theognis is speaking of the results of miscegenation in the \ir\ 0a\)|iaCe clause, with c?v y?p jiicyeTai ?c0A,? KaKo?c he must be referring to the act it self, and the earthy comparison of 183-185 certainly encourages the inference of sexual meaning here. This passage therefore can be justly accounted evidence for the deliberate ex ploitation of the dual application of meaning for verbs of the |j.e?yvD|ii/|i?cyco stems. The idea of miscegenation is present also in the earliest occurrences of cupiieiyvviii in an unambiguously sexual sense: in the Homeric hymn to Aphrodite the verb (together with the simplex and the ava-compound) is repeatedly used of the unions of gods with mortals (39, 46, 50, 52, 250). These unions provide Aphrodite with amusement for so long as she is the one causing others to form them; when Zeus impels her to fall in love and sleep with An chises, she is deeply ashamed (247-255). The source of shame is in part at least the Theog nidean concern with eugenics (254f.): ?nenXay%Q^v ?? v?oio, rca??a S' bnb ?covr) ?0? 7 Apart from the presence of the sexual reference, the sense of the Theognis differs from that of the Homer and Hesiod in that these represent the admixture of good with bad positively as a palliation of the latter. The precise meaning of Hesiod's words is not entirely clear (179-181 have been sometimes condemned; see West ad loc), but note that they occur in a discussion of yevtj.</page><page sequence="4">190 H. Pelliccia lirjv ?poTcp e?vnOe?ca. The shame and sorrow felt by gods in regard to these conjunctions and the mongrel offspring produced by them is well known from Thetis' laments in the Iliad, especially that addressed to Hephaestus in 18.429-441.8 The shame is a natural consequence of divine disdain for mortals: Aphrodite forbids Anchises to tell anyone that she is Aeneas' mother {h. Aphr. 281-288: r\v tic e?priTat ce KaTaOvTyrov avOpc&amp;Tccov ktA..), and according to Calypso, Zeus, following a well-known double standard, actively intervenes to prevent goddesses from such intercourse {Od.5.l 18-129).9 I stress that the anxieties caused by these conjunctions have to do with the horror of miscegenation, the mixing of things that, according to some either natural or conventional standard, do not belong together. A passage that may have been of the greatest importance for Virgil is Parthenius 640 SH: rcapO?voc r\ KiX?kcov e?xev avaKTOp?riv, ?y%?ya|ioc 8' enekev, KaOapcp 8' ?rce|iaiveTo Ku?vcp, K?rcpiSoc ?? aS?Tcov Ttupcov ?va\|/a|j?VTi,10 eic?Ke ?iiv K?rcpic 7cr|yr]v Geto, |i?^e 8' ?'pam K\)8vou Kal v\&gt;\upt\c u8aT?evTa y?fiov. Here again we see Aphrodite perform the role assigned her in the Homeric hymn: she effects the sexual union of different orders of being. The passage furnishes my argument with two crucial pieces of evidence: (1) the meeting of waters is explicitly presented as a sexual union, and the verb used is \ieiyvx&gt;\ii, and (2) the author is one known to have been of unique impor tance for the Roman new poets and their heirs; in short, we can feel some confidence that Vir gil knew this passage.11 To return to inamabilis in Georgics 4.479: Parthenius' word play combining the non sexual and sexual meanings of M??yvu?u/|i?cya&gt; in reference to rivers explains their amabilitas. What would make Stygian water lack this quality?

Likewise, Zeus' traditional role in the mating of Peleus and Thetis responds to a unique predicament. 10 Lloyd-Jones and Parsons translate line three "amoris flammam cum concepisset." 11 In general, see Wendell Clausen, "Callimachus and Latin Poetry" GRBS 5 (1964) 181-196 (esp. 188ff.); on Virgil's debt, see the same author's "Virgil and Parthenius" HSCP 80 (1976) 80.</page><page sequence="5">Aeschylean ?|i?yapToc and Virgilian inamabilis 191 This passage of the Iliad was famous. The earliest surviving reference would seem to be Pindar Paean 10 (a). 4, where the Peneios12 is called iTuyl cdv8etoc; the scholium attached quotes the Iliadic passage in explanation. The word cuvSetoc is apt for describing the rela tionship between rivers running in the same course without mingling their waters. The "myth" at the end of Plato's Phaedo concerns the disposition of souls in the under world, and includes a lengthy description of the four great rivers, Ocean, Acheron, Pyriphle gethon, and Cocytus; the last three are the rivers of the underworld, and the last two have the property of unmixability: Pyriphlegethon (113b) arrives nap' ec%aia tt\c 'AxepouctaSoc XijivTic, ou a)|i|A?iyv\)|j?voc t2&gt; u8aTi; then (113b6-c8): toutou 8? au KaTavTixp? ?

Plato draws upon the two Homeric passages describing offshoots (?rcoppcoyEc) of the Styx; the one (//. 2.751-755) gave him the idea of unmixability,13 the other {Od. 10. 513f.) gave 12 Snell/Maehler's text of lines 3-4 reads ?v r.a[ le?c Ttoxauov Tivaj I lTo[yl lc?vSetovj with the restorations taken from the scholia, which read as follows: opfcot) yap 8[eivo$ I]Ti&gt;y?c u8(aToc) ?

It is probable that the scholiast had independent reasons for identifying the river as Peneios: the previous scholia speak, apropos of ?vaxa in line 3, of an enneateris, i.e., a festival taking place every eight years. On the basis of the presumed Delphic context (i.e., a paean), Snell suggested that this festival might be the Del phic Septerion, which involved pilgrimage to Peneios. R. F?hrer has plausibly argued (Formproblem-Unter suchungen zu den Reden in der fr?hgriechischen Lyrik [Zetemata 44 (1967)] 125) that lines 11-22, at least, are a genealogical prophecy, and Ian Rutherford (in his forthcoming commentary) has extended F?hrer's observa tion, concluding from the future tense in line 11 and from the absence of introductory or concluding speech formulae throughout that the entire fragment belongs to this speech. I would add that the failure to specify the river's name in 3-4 is in keeping with prophetic speech convention; for Pindar's use of a "prophetic" tic to re fer to someone whose name is known in the present to himself and his audience, but was unspecified by or un known to the prophet depicted, see N. 5.36, where Zeus grants the virtuous Peleus a reward, ?ocr* ?v %?%?\ Tcovi?av %p\)ca?,(XK(XT?)v riva NripEiScov rap?^Eiv otKomv (Thetis had already been named 11 lines previ ous); see also N. 1.64 and N. 7.44, and cf. 0.2.59 and P. 1.52. It thus seems likely that the scholiast's report of the text e?c rcoTocuov tivoc is accurate, since it coheres with the prophetic conventions manifest in the re mainder. Given the way this kind of tic is applied to a subject whose name is presumed to be known, it also seems likely that the scholiast had independent reasons for identifying the river as Peneios:: either he would have known the details of the story from another source (especially plausible if the passage was concerned with a festival as famous as the Septerion), or else the Peneios was named elsewhere in Paean 10 outside of this conventionally vague prophetic speech (as Thetis is named earlier in N. 5). Either way, assuming that the identification is correct, his explanation of the phrase Lroyl c\&gt;v8etov relies, so far as we can see, entirely upon//. 2.751-755. 13 Bluck (R.S. Bluck, Plato's Phaedo [London 1955] 185) thinks that Plato invented this himself; Burnet on 114a5 points out that Plato gives the waters' unmixability a practical function in keeping the different types of souls borne by the rivers separate from one another when the rivers combine.</page><page sequence="6">192 H.

All of these authors depend on //. 2.751-755, which bears all the earmarks of having been a Hellenistic ?i|Tr||ia. Unfortunately, the scholia on this part of the catalogue do not survive.18 Likely places for Hellenistic treatment are Callimachus' Tcepl Nun&lt;pa&gt;v (frg. 413, containing discussion of the extraordinary properties of the Arcadian Styx; see further below) and Tcepl [t5&gt;v ev tt) o?koum?vti] rcoTajicuv (frgs. 457-460). At any rate, there can be little doubt but that Virgil was familiar with the extensive and distin 14 Plato refers or alludes to Homer elsewhere in this passage; besides the passages mentioned in the text: at 112a3 he quotes //. 8.14 on Tartarus; the inclusion of Ocean in the group with Acheron, Pyriphlegethon and Cocytus may reflect Od. 11.157f. (as per Burnet on Phd. 112e5, but cf. Heubeck on Od. loe. cit.); and Seiv?v te Kai ?ypiov, ?c X?yEtai in 113b7 may be based upon Circe's comment about Charybdis at Od. 12.119: Seiv?v t' ?pya^?ov te Kal ?ypiov o?S? ^a%nT?v. It is clear that Virgil in G. 471-480 was also looking to the Homeric model (Thomas ad loc. refers to Od. 11.34-43). Virgil's placement of the word Cocyti at the be ginning of line 479 may or may not be a nod, like Plato's, to Od. 10.514 (quoted above in the text, and the on ly Homeric instance of the name; cf. also Lycophron 705f. for the idea if not meter); at any rate, though the earliest surviving instance of the name Cocytus in Latin poetry is in Virgil, he himself places it first in the line also at G. 3.38, A. 6.132, 323, and 7.562; in Greek cf. Euphorion 43.1 Powell and Hermesianax 7.9 Powell; in post-Virgilian Latin, cf. Juvenal 2.150, Petronius 120. line 69, and Sil. 12.117 and 13.426; cf. Nonnus 44. 262. Note that Plato's account has other features in common with Virgil's at G. 478-490: the confluence of the infernal waters, the marshes (Xi\ivr\, limus, palus), the dark color (oiov ? Kuavoc, niger), and the encircling movement of the rivers (7cepieXittojlievoc, KDKtap mpieXQev, novies...interfusa). 15 Housman ad loc. notes the debt to Herodotus. For other passages from the Neronian age in which the Styx and Titaresios are discussed, see n. 24 below. 16 I follow the text of Shackleton Bailey (Stuttgart 1988), including Housman's transposition of 374 to follow 368. 17 Discussed below, n. 23.

We are now in a position to try to reconstruct Virgil's procedure and its effects, which can be assumed to be its purpose. In the Georgics passage as a whole (4.471-480) he is char acterizing the underworld briefly and in as pathetic a fashion as this brevity will allow: note the prominence given to "boys and unmarried girls, and youths placed upon pyres before the eyes of their parents" (476f.). On the other hand, he is following traditional models; Thomas points to Od. 11.34-43, and other traditional features have been pointed out here (see n. 14). Given the pathetic context, it is certain that the primary meaning of inamabilis is "hateful;" Henrichs has shown how the formation of the word itself is traditional for the underworld. The question I have raised is "why the ama-stemT' The answer is first that it communicates directly the required meaning "hateful." For the learned in Virgil's audience, however, there will have been something richer and more specific: the notion that the hatefulness of the Styx has a physical manifestation: its unmixability. Inamabilis, as applied to the Styx, will have acquired the meaning "unmixable" from //. 2.751-755 via Parthenius 640. Virgil took from Parthenius the word play on |ieiyvu|ii, by which the mingling of river waters was equated with sexual intercourse (|i??e EpcoTi), and from//. 2.751-755 the information that Stygian water o??' ? cu|U|i?cyeTai. Parthenius 640 enabled Virgil to understand //. 2.753 ou5* ? cu|i|LiicyeTai as o??' ? cupiucyerai epam; this introduction of the erotic element into //. 2.753 will have been encouraged by the application of the epithet IjiEpT?c19 to Titaresios in 751: the river is desirable (ijiEpT?c), but erotically unattainable (ouS' ? cuiLipicyeTai): in amabilis.20 This is precisely the situation described in Parthenius 640; compare also Nonnus 40.141-143, on the maiden Comaetho, who apparently was another who enjoyed conversion to water (2.144 ve?ppura %E?jxaTa) for the sake of love.21 o?a Ko|iai0ci&gt;, il Tc?poc ifiep?evToc epaccajiEvri nora?oio TEp7TETai ?yKOCC ?%OUCa Kal E?CETl Ku?VOV ?KO?TTlV.22 19 Applied to t??ocTa at Ap.

See the next note. 20 On the semantics of the word (in-)amabilis: it should be noted that such -bilis adjectives reflect (1) the transitive use of the verb as passives ("lovable"), and (2) the intransitive use of the verb as active/intransitives ("capable of participating in love"); thus, e.g., mobilis (both "movable" and "mobile"); likewise mutabilis. In the case of amabilis the intransitive includes the idea of reciprocity: being receptive to someone else's love and returning it. The absence of this quality (inamabilis) is best illustrated by cases in which there is an object of desire who does not reciprocate that desire, and who is thus, viewed from the outside, impossible to love recip rocally, e.g., the Euripidean Hippolytus. For the use of amabilis, see line lOf. of the Pyrrha ode: qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem sperat. It goes without saying that Pyrrha will continue to be an object of her wretched lover's desire; what he hopes is that she will always be loving in the sense of responding favorably to his initations of love and love making: she will be receptive to his love and reciprocate it; but, of course, on Horace's prediction, she will not do this: she will cease to be amabilis, and thus become inamabilis. Likewise the unmixable-but ?u?pr?v-water of the Styx. 21 The two Nonnus passages are quoted by Lloyd-Jones and Parsons on Parthenius 640. 22 RJ. Tarrant draws my attention to Ovid, Met. 5.635-638, where Arethusa tells how, when she was pursued by Alpheus in human form, Diana changed her into a spring; Alpheus then reverted to river form, ut se mihi misceat.</page><page sequence="8">194 H. Pelliccia It may be objected that allusion to Parthenius 640?a witty and playful passage?is un suitable to the emotional tone of G.4.479ff. Allusion is not really the procedure I envision, however. We need not think of Virgil as directing attention to Parthenius' poem; rather, Parthenius, by making explicit the connection between aquatic mixability and the physical love of rivers, enabled his successors to exploit that equation in whatever context they might wish. The solemnity of G. 4.471-80 is established by the whole subject matter, and that of inama bilis in 479 by the Styx itself. Oblique reference to the unmixability of Stygian water will not have been an otiose and inappropriate display of erudition. We saw earlier how Plato used the same concepts in his "myth" about the rivers of the underworld; he maintained the Homeric detail about the unmixability of Pyriphlegethon's and Cocytus' waters because he could ex ploit that quality as contributing to the rivers' function of keeping different types of souls sep arated (see Bumet, cited in n. 13 above). Virgil also lays stress on Styx' restraining of the souls (480 coercet). Furthermore, it seems quite possible that the unmixability of Stygian water was a functional aspect of its deadliness; there is a well established tradition about the spring Styx in Arcadia and the destructive properties of its waters. It was said by Callimachus (among others) to have been uncontainable in any material other than horn (frg. 413): Itu? ?v Nc?vaKpivTj t?\c 'ApKa?iac u?cop ect? to ?iaKOrcTOV n?via Ta ?yyEia nX^v t?v KEpaT?vcov.23 This quality?what might be called its "unfriendliness" to other elements?is consistent with that of unmixability. There is every reason to think that the unmixability of the Styx?its inamabilitas?was a very serious and dire matter.24 Finally, there is the question of my proposal's plausibility. The answer to this question will depend on the reader's conception of Virgil's artistry. I hope to have made it clear, in both the texts and the footnotes, that the relevant ideas about Stygian water were not merely available, but were celebrated; they were a part of the literate public's consciousness, as they are not part of ours; any estimation of plausibility must take that fact into account. Cornell University Hayden Pelliccia 23 In addition to the passages collected by Pfeiffer, see Pausanias 8.17.6ff. (with Frazer's note), Seneca QN 3.25.1, which discusses the deadliness of the Arcadian Styx and adds that est aeque noxia aqua in Thessalia circa Tempe, quam et fera et pecus omne devitat; that this refers to Titaresios seems probable, as shown by Pliny, NH 2.231, also on the deadliness of Arcadian Styx, and 31.27, on the same subject, but this time citing the Arcadian Styx as representative of a group of certain things which blandiuntur aspectu (cf. IjiEpT?c); he then goes on (31.28): aliter circa Thessalia Tempe, quoniam virus omnibus terrori est, traduntque aena etiam acfer rum erodi ilia aqua. Profluit, ut indicavimus, brevi spatio... The reference is to 4.31, where we find discus sion of Peneus and Titraresios (under the name Orcus): (the Vale of Tempe) hoc labitur Peneus, vitreus calculo, amoenus circa ripas gramine, canorus avium concentu. accipit amnem Orcon, nee recepit, sed olei modo super natantem, ut dictum est Homero, brevi spatio portatum abdicat, poenales aquas Dirisque genitas argenteis suis misceri r?cusons. All of which demonstrates that the unmixability of the Styx and Titaresios was associated with their deadliness. 24 CAF Adesp. 373 may contrast the ideas of mixability with those of harshness and hateftilness: (You were created not out of flesh and) oi)% a?uaToc Kal tcov oca to?toic K?pvaTai I ?XX* e? aS?uavTOc Kal TC?Tpac ei Kal Iroy?c.
