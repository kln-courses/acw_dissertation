<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO KUBA WROUGHT-IRON STATUETTES ADRIAAN CLAERHOUT On April 13, 1920, the City of Ant- werp, Belgium, acquired part of the famous Pareyn collection, which now belongs to its Etnografisch Museum.' Included in the acquisition were two wrought-iron human figurines, today bearing the inventory numbers AE. 773 and AE. 774 and identified as Kuba. As they are believed to be the only known specimens of wrought-iron human figure sculpture deriving from Central Africa, one wonders that little attention has been given to them until now. The name Kuba encompasses a federa- tion of eighteen tribes that live in south central Zaire, between the Sankuru and Kasal rivers. To avoid confusion, it should also be mentioned that the Kuba were named by their neighbors, the Luba, and they are often called the Bushongo, which is actually the name of the ruling group within this federation. The former Kuba nation, like the Ashanti in Ghana and the peoples of Ife and Benin in Nigeria, embraced sacred kingship. The royal genealogy occupies an important place in the oral history, which recorded the 124th ruler2 at the beginning of the twentieth century. According to oral tradition, the bearers of what finally would become Kuba culture reached their present home some 1500 years ago. Dur- ing the reign of the sixth king, the Kuba grew familiar with one of the most impor- tant elements of material culture: iron. The relation between kingship and art is extremely significant for Kuba art. In this connection, their 93rd king, Shya'am aM- bhlingoong (better known as Shamba Bolongongo),3 is always mentioned. He is M, r LEFT: KUBA FIGURINE AE.773. HEIGHT 19.5cm. RIGHT: AE.774. HEIGHT 18.7cm. BOTH PIECES ARE IN THE ETNOGRAFISCH MUSEUM, ANTWERP. remembered by the Kuba not only as a successful conqueror and a wise and ethical ruler, but also as the first to have his effigy carved in wood so that his ideals would not be forgotten. It is not necessary to go further into the tradition of the Kuba royal statues here; I merely want to emphasize that apart from these, no ap- preciable figural sculpture has been produced, with the exception of the typical anthropomorphic cups. The ex- istence of the two figurines is thus remarkable. The earliest source of information on these wrought-iron pieces is the well- known work by Torday and Joyce.4 Everything that we know at this moment about the origin and the probable age of the statuettes is mentioned here (p. 25, un- der 86): "MIELE. This chief was . . . famous blacksmith and, under his reign, the art of hammering iron attained a very high degree of perfection. It is said that figurines of men and animals have been wrought, some of them reaching a size of 18 inches. None of them could be found, the last specimens or, according to certain traditions, the ten last ones have been given to a Government officer by the pres- ent king." I might mention that there is but one known Kuba iron animal figurine (published for the first time in 1972!), a dog, 46 centimeters long and 25.5 cen- timeters high, in the collection of Theo Verwilghen. On page 37, Torday and Joyce repeat what they noted during their 1907 fieldwork: that under the 86th ruler, Myeel (Miele), iron human and animal figurines were made. They premise the date of their production as ca. 1515, calculated according to autochthonous historical traditions. On page 195 they emphasize that blacksmiths were much respected in the Kuba community and that many members of the large council worked iron, as did even kings, "in par- ticular Bope Pelenge and Miele, who were very skillful at working metals." As his short communication in the periodical Man suggests,5 Torday, probably in 1923, must have had quite a surprise. After quoting his own text regarding the lost figurines, he wrote: "On a recent visit to Belgium, I was fortunate enough to obtain confirmation of this in- teresting tradition. In the Museum of the Butchers' Hall in Antwerp I found the in- teresting figurines which are illustrated in pl. B and fig. 1. They reached the museum 60</page><page sequence="2">with a collection of objects from the Congo and are probably the-or two of the-figures referred to by the chief as given to a Belgian officer." Further on, he justifies his opinion that they are indeed those statuettes: "The style is unmis- takably Bushongo; the resemblance of the heads to the cup represented in fig. 289, c. 'Les Bushongo,' p. 199 is striking." Tor- day ends by repeating his former estimate of their age: "I believe that in these specimens we have two examples of six- teenth century Bushongo ironwork of which there remains in their native country only the tradition." F. Olbrechts was the first to make these figurines publicly known, on the occasion of the exhibition "Kongo-kunst," which he organized in Antwerp in 1937 (cat. nos. 268 and 269). He did not, however, give the pieces any special notice. They met the same fate in a number of other exhibitions held between 1956 and 1975, both in and outside Belgium.6 Only in the catalogue of the 1971 exhibition "Kongo, Gestalten und Zeiten" in Mannheim was an in- terpretation, to which I shall return later, of the figurines ventured. Neither does an examination of the known literature on black African art improve our knowledge of the pieces: they generally have been reproduced with no comment, or given only casual mention by scholars.7 A discussion of the statuettes should start with a morphologic description. Statuette AE. 773, representing a standing human figure, is 19.5 centimeters high and weighs 840 grams. The upper portion of the head is slightly conical, and a hole (it is, in fact, a notch, which is covered with a small knob) pierces the top from back to front. The typical Kuba hairline can be easily recognized, defining the triangular face. Curved eyebrows meet on the bridge of the nose, and the outlines of the almond-shaped eyes, the mouth and the ears, which are shaped like stylized ques- tion marks, are in slight relief. The trunk is an irregular cylinder, which ends in a flattened stump that is marked in front with a short vertical groove. The figure's limbs have obviously been welded to the torso, as have the fingers to the hands. Whereas the right upper arm is very short and touches the trunk, the forearm ex- tends forward and ends in an enlarged crenated hand, its thumb and forefinger broken off and the other fingers curved in- ward. The left arm, though similar, has more natural proportions. The upper arm does not touch the trunk, and the hand is turned with the palm up, its fingers curved toward the figure. A small torsioned bar welded to the left shoulder ends in a slight curve between the statuette's elbow and trunk. Its feet are club-like and bear no in- dication of toes. There seem to be rem- nants of broken-off points of fixation or support on the soles of the feet, but these are not convincing. A matte reddish patina appears in spots all over the statuette. h: 61</page><page sequence="3">The other figure, AE. 774, is 18.7 centimeters high and weighs 510 grams. It differs morphologically from the first statuette in a number of ways. The top of the head is pierced crosswise as well as from front to back, and no ears are indicated. The shoulders are somewhat more narrow than the hips, and the trunk is somewhat flatter than that of the other figure. The trunk ends not in a stump but in a beam-shaped extension that is about one centimeter longer than the legs. In addition, the right upper arm of this statuette stands slightly away from the side of the trunk. Compared to the other piece, its hands have fared poorly. The right thumb, forefinger and middle finger are broken off, and the two remaining fingers are curved against the palm; all fingers are missing from the left hand. The feet are of the same club-like shape, but there are vertical indenta- tions to indicate toes. Finally, the matte reddish patina is even more present on this figurine than on the other. At first sight, both pieces look as if they were cast rather than wrought. This impression is probably mainly due to the emphatic "round bossed" character of the head with its features in relief, and to the shape of the trunk, which gives the appearance of modeling. M. Mazy, Professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Antwerp, and a sculptor familiar with ironwork techniques, had the same impres- sion. He confirmed that the arms and legs had been welded to the torso, and fingers to the palms of the hands. I am .................. .. i ..........2 a it hm M'"i BACK VIEW OF AE.773 most grateful for Prof. Mazy's advice on the texture of the figurines; he was impressed by traces of what he called the "white glowing out of the component elements," which ap- pears at very high temperatures (12000 to 12500 C). When the metal glows white-hot, the elements being forged are not merely joined but completely fused together. Ac- cording to Prof. Mazy, repeated glowing out causes the surface of the metal to oxidize, forming scales, which ac- counts for the texture of the pieces. The reddish color observed on both statuettes as a patina-meaning a superficial coloration added after the objects had been made-might also be a result of the repeated glowing out at very high temperatures. I myself am convinced that these traces of color are the remains of a mixture containing ngula (also tukula) powder that was rubbed onto the pieces; at a moist touch, some spots come off as a deep red color. Ultimately, however, one theory does not preclude the other. I should next attend to the extensions from the trunks of the statuettes. These have been interpreted by D. Williams as "prominent male and female genitalia."' It is most probable that this author came to this conclusion because of the vertical indentation on the stump of figurine AE. 773, which he interpreted as female genitals. Because he did not personally view the items, he failed to notice that the beam-shaped extension on the other piece is about one cen- gy&amp; 16" iiiiiii~l~~iili~ !i~~iii~ BACK VIEW OF AE.774 62</page><page sequence="4">v4 AL X? m lw?

Also, the statuette with the supposed female genitals displays no other female characteristics; according to Prof. Mazy, the flat lower edge of the protuberance shows beyond a doubt that it is a remnant of an extension like that on the other figurine, which had broken off. This supposition leads of course to the question of the purpose of this feature. The answer seems obvious: in this way, the asexual figurines could be fixed on a socle in which holes had been drilled for that purpose. Some West African brass groups are mounted in this manner. That such ensembles may have existed with the Kuba was told to Vansina (p. 308) by different inform- ants talking about the ruler Myeel: "He forged iron statues, a proa with its crew and a complete house in miniature." The crew of such a proa or the inhabitants of such a house may have been mounted in this way on the boat or on the house floor. As to why the arms were so positioned and why the hands were enlarged is a problem that we approach with diffidence. I certainly do not en- dorse A. von Gagern's9 interpretation in the catalogue of the exhibition "Kongo, Gestalten und Zeiten": "The iron figure with the enlarged hands, symbolizing the 'energetic man.' " It seems rather that these hands, the enlargement of which should perhaps be attributed to the forging technique, were meant to hold something. As this question cannot be answered by means of analogies to Kuba wood sculpture, I hope that Kuba and Zai're specialists may offer a valid explanation; they are herewith invited, if not chal- lenged, to do so. An essential problem is, of course, that of the age of these figurines. Torday's assumption, "I believe that in these specimens we have two examples of sixteenth century ironwork of which there remains in their native country only the tradition," cannot be accepted straight away. This reluctance is not caused by a distrust of the oral tradition on which the assumption is based, for a collation of different sources and critical interpretation has proved that this can indeed be trusted, as is demonstrated by Vansina.? He (p. 286) locates Myeel in the seventeenth century, but there is no explicit evidence that the statuettes were indeed made by him. Vansina (p. 308, note 305) also mentions that in fact every remarkable work of wrought iron is attributed to Myeel. Leaving aside the supposition that the pieces were made by Myeel himself, there is no element what- soever that can provide a relative date, except for the year 1907 (when Torday and Joyce heard about these sculptures during their fieldwork) which may be used as a terminus ante quem. If one assumes that there are no other items proving the existence of figural iron sculpture prior to this year, one can only fall back on authochthonous oral tradi- tions, namely those concerning the era from ca. 1630 to 1680. Vansina (p. 341) reports, "It appears from testimonies that weaving techniques, sculpture and forging flourished during this period." For the sake of thoroughness, I should add that doubts have arisen concerning the correctness of the Kuba attribu- tion. Some years ago, it was theorized that the statuettes could be Pende. This supposition was based on a stylistic 63</page><page sequence="5">GALERIE CONCORDE LTD. 6890 ALTA LOMA TERRACE LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA 90068 BY APPOINTMENT 213 * 851-1637 213 * 874-8434 WILLIAM MOORE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATES MORTON LIPKIN HENRI L.

The comparison does not seem to be a very valid one; com- parison should rather have been made with illustrations 228 and 229, at least in reference to the posture of the body. Although the shape of the head greatly differs from that of the iron figurines from the Kuba, the headdress of both Pende figures-conical with a knob on top-is nevertheless comparable with that of both Kuba statuettes. According to Vansina's (p. 252) chapter on the origin of the Kuba, it is indeed useful to think of the Pende in connection with Kuba iron sculpture: "The linguistic data seem to indicate that the great mass of them would have lived along the lower Kwango river. The stay of the central group of Kuba tribes in the Kwango area should, according to chronology, be located in the 16th century." He (p. 335) also relates that during the archaic period (ca. 1568 to ca. 1630), "Iron-working was certainly known by the im- migrants. It may suffice to point out that the smith's ham- mer was pre-eminently a royal symbol." It is further known (p. 296-298) that a king preceding the time of Myeel, Shyaam aMb1ingoong, went to the west during his youth and also visited the land of the Pende, from where he would have brought back a collection of cultural goods, among them sculpture; some informants of Vansina also said that on his return Shyaam was accompanied by Ngoombe and Maluk; the Pende are also reckoned among the Maluk. Whatever may have been the origin of Kuba wrought- iron work, it seems that the stylistic element of the Kuba hairline alone is sufficient reason to stick to the Kuba at- tribution for these two statuettes. The fact that these statuettes, for the time being, must be considered as unique examples of wrought-iron human figure sculpture from Central Africa, is not cause for a rejection of this proposi- tion, based on the data supplied by Kuba oral history, which attributes the statuettes to the hand of King Myeel during the seventeenth century. 0 Notes, page 92 64</page><page sequence="6">KUBA STATUETTES, Notes,frompage 64. 1.
