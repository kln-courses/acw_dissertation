<plain_text><page sequence="1">126 ANTHROPOMORPIISM AND ANALOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY' BY KATHLEEN V. VWILKES The study of the brain sets a pretty problem for the philosophy of psychology. On the one hand, our knowledge of the brain is so sketchy that we may seem justified in using any terminology that might increase our understanding; but on the other, mentalistic or anthropomorphic termin- ology appears to take us away from, rather than towards, "scientific" explanation. Scientific explanations we expect-rightly or wrongly-to find couched in an extensional, quantitative vocabulary; physics (or, better in this context, biology) could stand here as a paradigm. In the present state of psychology and psychoanalysis, however, the brain and its operations are often described not in physical but in mentalistic terms. Information theorists, for example, attribute to cerebroceptive structures or mechanisms such functions as analysing stimulus input and coding and decoding, or storing and retrieving, information; and in psychoanalysis the mentalizing of the brain extends to the outright anthropomorphism of hypothesized entities within it: the superego is said to "behave sadistically" towards the ego, which can "take the superego as love-object", "suffer anxiety", and "distort" id-impulses which themselves "struggle for gratification". The Ego and the Id2 is the fertile source of these, and other, extreme instances of personification of id, ego, and superego. It is not difficult to see why this mentalizing tendency is so pronounced. Consider that we have a complex and sophisticated battery of psychological terms with which to describe the actions, motives, dispositions, wants, be- liefs, drives and personalities of human beings; the person as subject can be ascribed a huge range of psychological predicates. At the other end of the spectrum, i.e., at the level of the microscopic analysis of the brain's smallest identifiable functioning parts, the vocabulary of the neurophysiological sciences can describe all that happens-neurons fire, synapses discharge, cells synthesize RNA, and so on. In between these two extremes, the person at one end and the individual neuron or cell at the other, lies the mind-body problem: the problem of accounting for the activities of the first in the terminology of the second, and, conversely, of explaining how the activation of thousands of neurons can underpin the psychological states of belief, wish, motive, and intention. Therefore we must discover a vocabulary with which to describe the functioning of what might be called the medium-sized elements: that is, of elements which are more than a neuron but less than 1I am heavily indebted to Thomas Nagel for his comments and criticisms of earlier versions of this paper. 2Standard Edition, vol. XIX, pp. 3-66 (1961).</page><page sequence="2">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND ANALOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY 127 a person-such as the brain itself, its left and right hemispheres, the tem- poral lobe, the cortex, Wernicke's area, the anterior commissure; also, of course, of such hypothesized entities as "information retrieval mechanisms", "input analysers", "id", "ego", "superego", and "the unconscious". All these items are, or are hypothesized to be, individuatable functioning com- plexes and are themselves the subjects of predicates which must be found to describe their characteristic functioning-for they have functions more global than those of, say, neurons but less global than those of human beings. All a neuron does is "fire"; but the temporal lobe, for instance, by virtue of the activation of countless neurons, has its own unique functions in the collation, codification, and transmission of stimuli. If indeed the whole were not in some sense greater than its parts-if one could indeed describe the functioning of Wernicke's area in the same terminology as that used to describe the operations of its constituent neurons-we should not need to identify it as a brain mass at all. We do, however, individuate it, knowing that as such it plays a large part in the process of object-identification; and evidently we have conveniently to hand the so-called "characteristically human" predicates in terms of which to describe it and specify its functional importance. Thus we are driven to say that it collates and associates information, and passes information to Broca's area and to the speech centre. Put another way, the characteristic activity of thousands of neurons is re-interpreted as the different characteristic activity of a discrete brain mass. What, after all, is the alternative? Here, I suggest, we have the very heart and core of the mind-body problem, for here is the unplumbed middle ground between the explicitly psychological and the purely physical, a ground where mental and physical terminologies compete for the descrip- tive role. Freud himself was well aware of this dilemma-the dilemma that arises from the tension between the assumption that the brain is in fact a physical system, and the knowledge that no current physical concepts are adequate to characterize its operations. In The Interpretation of Dreams we find him writing: I have no inclination at all to keep the domain of the psychological floating, as it were, in the air, without any organic foundation. But I have no knowledge, neither theoretically nor therapeutically, be- yond that conviction, so I have to conduct myself as if I had only the psychological before me.3 In the early Project for a Scientific Psychology4 (composed in 1895) Freud had attempted just such a foundation-an ambitious and optimistic venture. Later, realizing more clearly the difficulties of such a task, he deplored the work to the extent of trying to have it destroyed. Despite this subsequent pessimism, he never abandoned his faith in the truth of physicalism, a faith which the most interesting contemporary psychoanalysis maintains. 3Tr.

VWILRES I Let us turn, then, to consider the range of objections brought against the mentalizing of the brain and its functions. The objections are not all directed at precisely the same targets; some concern the legitimacy of the introduction of unconscious mental events, others rather attack the anthro- pomorphization of actual or hypothetical brain structures. I will mention three groups of objections. (i) The first objection, which is directed specifically towards mentalism in psychoanalysis, comes from writers who are concerned about the scientific status of the discipline. They point out that many of the common charges brought against psychoanalytic theory-its lack of adequate testability, of agreement on what counts as evidence and what does not-might be at least mitigated if the metaphorical characterization of theoretical entities, processes, and systems could be supplanted by literal characterizations. It is by means of literal and unpicturesque factual statements that one makes determinate, testable claims with specific content. Now it is easy to sym- pathize with reasons such as these for disliking metaphor in scientific theory (and anthropomorphism is, of course, but one type of metaphor); evidently there are powerful arguments in favour of the accuracy of literal statements, if such are forthcoming, as opposed to the more suggestive and impression- istic nature of metaphorical locutions. Psychoanalysts themselves unite in acknowledging that their theories are loaded with anthropomorphic termin- ology; but there is considerable disagreement about the implications of this fact for the scientific status of the discipline. Some (e.g., J. H. Masserman, in his Principles of Dynamic Psychiatry (1946), p. 169) disregard it, claiming that it is unavoidable, detracts not at all from the explanatory power of the discipline, and is in any case ubiquitous in all sciences. Others (such as H. Hartmann; see The Encyclopaedia of Psychoanalysis, p. 418) consider it eliminable and consequently harmless, although allowing that it would be a serious matter for psychoanalysis were it not eliminable. A third view is more ambivalent: N. Nash (in his "Freud and Metaphor", A.M.A. Arch. Gen. Psychiat., VII (1962)) regards it as at present necessary, but to be abandoned once suitably precise statements of relations between observed phenomena can be formulated. Other theorists consider anthropomorphiza- tion to be harmless in the clinical theory-that is, in the classification, description, and study of individual cases-but at least questionable in the higher-order propositions that belong to the theoretical levels of the disci- pline: here, however, they observe that efforts to eliminate it have so far proved fruitless (see W. Grossman and B. Simon, "Anthropomorphism", in The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child, 1969). As for Freud himself, he is reported to have said: "It is not at all necessary to outgrow it. Our under- standing reaches as far as our anthropomorphism" (Minutes of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, vol. I, 1906-8: I owe this reference to Grossman and Simon, op. cit., p. 78). This remark, however, is too gnomic to be of much</page><page sequence="4">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND ANALOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY 129 use; Freud may have meant that anthropomorphic metaphor made easier the intuitive grasp of a complex subject, while not committing himself to the view that anthropomorphism held any place in the formulation of a scientific explanation. (ii) A second objection directs itself explicitly against the anthropomor- phization of parts of the brain, claiming that the so-called "explanation" reached by means of an overt or tacit personification of cerebral systems is an illusory, question-begging explanation-this whether the topic is, say, human memory, the id, or self-deception. D. C. Dennett puts the point thus: Of all the common analogies used to describe the brain, the analogy of a community of correspondents (which is the inevitable suggestion whenever there is talk of codes and languages in the brain) is the most far-fetched and least useful. It has the disadvantage of merely post- poning the central problem before us by positing unanalysed man- analogues as systematic elements in that which we are trying to describe, namely Man. The "little man in the brain", Ryle's "ghost in the machine", is a notorious non-solution to the problems of mind.5 The core of this objection, as I see it, is the reasonable argument that if the analysandum reappears essentially in the analysans, no explanation is effected. If asked, "How does the Eezi-Lay linoleum factory make lino- leum?" I reply, "By employing 5,000 men who make Eezi-Lay linoleum", I shall scarcely have satisfied my questioner-or rather, since the adequacy of any answer is relative to the knowledge possessed by the inquirer, I may have provided a temporary satisfaction; the point, however, remains that subsequently exactly the same question arises about how the 5,000 men make the stuff. There is a notorious example of a circular psychological explanation of this type: people used to begin to explain the process of perception by hypothesizing an internal image of the perceived object in- side the head; to make such a model work, of course, one was then com- mitted to the introduction of an internal perceiver to observe that image. What is to be explained cannot reappear unanalysed in the explanation- a principle few would wish to dispute. Dennett's point is that the analysan- dum for psychology is Man, or intelligence, and that the anthropomorphiza- tion of parts of the brain creates a bureaucracy of intelligent man-analogues, thus making for a viciously circular analysis. (iii) The third group of objections simply attacks the legitimacy of the introduction of unconscious mental events. It claims that accessibility to introspective awareness is an essential part of the meaning of such terms as 'wish', 'belief', 'desire', 'anxiety' and the like; and so we can only talk of unconscious wishes, beliefs or desires by analogy, unless we agree that we have changed the meaning of such terms when we preface them by the adjective 'unconscious'. A couple of citations, from Arthur Pap and Ernest 5D. C. Dennett, Content and Consciousness, p. 87. For a philosopher's attack on anthropomorphization specifically in psychoanalysis, see E. Nagel, "Methodological Issues in Psychoanalytic Theory", in S. Hook (ed.), Psychoanalysis, Scientific Method, and Philosophy (New York, 1959), pp. 38-56.</page><page sequence="5">130 . V. VWILKES Nagel, will illustrate this line of argument. Pap writes: "The word 'hatred' is ordinarily so used that empirical possibility of introspective awareness of the emotion . . . is part of its meaning."6 And Nagel claims: "There is an important failure of analogy between conscious motives and unconscious mental processes, so that it is only by a radical shift in the customary mean- ings of such words as 'motive' and 'wish' that Freudian theory can be said to offer an explanation of human conduct in terms of motivations and wish- fulfilments."7 The mental, in short, is declared to be co-extensive with the conscious. II I shall deal with this last objection first, because it is much the easiest to answer; indeed, Freud has already said all that is necessary to justify the introduction of the hypothesis of an unconscious mental life.8 He attacks forcibly, in his metapsychological paper The Unconscious,9 what he terms the "conventional identification of the mental with the conscious" as being "thoroughly unpractical": . . .it breaks up mental continuity, plunges us into the insoluble difficulties of psychophysical parallelism, is open to reproach that without any manifest grounds it overestimates the part played by consciousness, and finally it forces us prematurely to retire from the territory of psychological research without being able to offer us any compensations elsewhere. Again, in another work (Some Elementary Lessons in Psychoanalysis)0l we find him discussing this issue once more: We are told that in spite of the facts that have been mentioned, there is no necessity to abandon the identity between what is con- scious and what is mental; the so-called unconscious processes are the organic processes which have long been recognized as running parallel to the mental ones. Our reply is that it would be unjustifiable and inexpedient to make a breach in the unity of mental life for the sake of propping up a definition, since it is clear in any case that conscious- ness can only offer us an incomplete and broken chain of phenomena. And it can scarcely be a matter of chance that it was not until the change had been made in the definition of the mental that it became possible to construct a comprehensive and coherent theory of mental life. Freud makes two main points here. The first is that since there is no sharp line, only a sliding scale, between rational and abnormal or aberrant be- haviour, it is folly to insist that there is one kind of explanation appropriate in the analysis of normal behaviour-that is, the ascription to the agent of 6A. Pap, "On the Empirical Interpretation of Psychoanalytic Concepts", in Hook (ed.), op. cit., p. 296. 70p. cit., p. 45. 8See also A. G. N. Flew's discussion of this point in his "Motives and the Uncon- scious", in H. Feigl and M. Scriven (edd.), Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. I (Minnesota, 1956). 9Standard Edition, vol. X. ?1Collected Papers, vol. V, p. 382.</page><page sequence="6">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND ANALOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY 131 a desire and belief adequate to explain his acting as he did-and quite another kind of account for the still purposive, even if abnormal, behaviour that we meet with from hysterics, neurotics, or from ourselves when we forget things or make slips of the tongue. Indeed, it was precisely when studying the behaviour of hysterical patients under Charcot that Freud first came to realize that purposive concepts were essential in order to account for their actions: physicalistic concepts had proved entirely inadequate. (Hence his insistence on the fact that if we abjure the postulation of un- conscious mental events, we abandon all hope of any explanation.) The moral Freud draws is that all human behaviour is amenable to explanation on a unitary model-via a citation of some beliefs, desires, motives or pur- poses. Sometimes, indeed very often, the cited mental events will be un- conscious (or preconscious); and sometimes not. Unconscious mental pro- cesses are as real a motivating factor-as undeniably "there"-as are their conscious or preconscious counterparts. His second argument is that we cannot even make sense of our cherished conscious mental events without the hypothesis of an unconscious mental life. There are gaps, anomalies, hiatuses in the stream of consciousness which would stand unexplained unless the lacunae were filled by unconscious mental events. Indeed, at times Freud seems to give the primacy to un- conscious, rather than conscious, mental phenomena: . . .being conscious cannot be the essence of what is mental. It is only a quality of what is mental, and an unstable quality at that- one that is far oftener absent than present. The mental, whatever its nature may be, is in itself unconscious and probably similar in kind to all the other natural processes of which we have obtained knowledge.11 There is clearly no possibility, to Freud's mind, that unconscious wishes, beliefs, desires etc. are only called so by analogy, or at the expense of a change in meaning of the terms.12 Non-psychoanalytic arguments can be adduced to back up this position. It would be thoroughly inconvenient for many scientists to concur with Pap's demand that 'introspective awareness' should be an inalienable part of the meaning of many mental terms (even though it is of course hard to see how some could exist without consciousness -embarrassment, for example). Pap's requirement is that, for some mental states X, if I have X then I am aware, or potentially aware, of X. But not "lSome Elementary Lessons in Psychoanalysis, op. cit., p. 379. This passage instantly provokes inquiry about what precisely Freud's position on the nature of the psychical and its relation to the physical might be. I must ignore this question; it is illuminatingly discussed by Thomas Nagel, in "Freud's Anthropomorphism", in Richard Wollheim (ed.), Freud (forthcoming). 12Unconscious mental phenomena are certainly introduced and explained by appeal to their analogy with what we antecedently know about-conscious mental events. Freud even compares our knowledge of our own unconscious mental life with our know- ledge of the existence of other minds (in The Unconscious (Collected Papers, vol. V), p. 101 ff.). But this is not to say that unconscious mental events have a different on- tological status from conscious mental events; it is only relevant to the way we initially come to know about them.</page><page sequence="7">132 K. . WILKES only is self-deception an acknowledged phenomenon-where Pap's demand cannot be tolerated-but there is also the point that students of animal or child behaviour need to be able to attribute mental states to animals and infants (including hate) where there is unquestionably goal-seeking behaviour but considerable doubt whether this subjective experiential aspect is present. And finally, one purely philosophical consideration: there is a notorious problem in distinguishing changes in the meaning of the term 'X' from mere changes in our beliefs about Xs. I will not here go further into this murky area than to say that none of the reasons for supposing a change in meaning apply here. As Freud writes: . . . we know for certain that they [unconscious mental processes] have abundant points of contact with conscious mental processes; on being submitted to a certain method of operation they may be trans- formed into or replaced by conscious processes, and all the categories which we employ to describe conscious mental acts, such as ideas, purposes, resolutions and so forth, can be applied to them. Indeed, of many of these latent states, we have to assert that the only point in which they differ from states which are conscious is just in the lack of consciousness of them.13 The differences between conscious and unconscious mental processes, in other words, are not extensive enough to justify a charge of meaning-change. Unconscious, preconscious, and conscious mental phenomena stand on an equal ontological footing. III We may now turn back to consider the remaining objections: one was that metaphor in psychological or psychoanalytic theorizing was unscientific, making for vagueness, untestability, and imprecision. The second held that anthropomorphization of actual or hypothesized structures in the brain- such as the ego or id, or Wernicke's area, or information retrieval mechan- isms-generated a viciously circular analysis by breeding a bureaucracy of intelligent man-analogues in the brain. I propose to dissolve the first objec- tion by tackling the second; for if I can defend the allegedly anthropomorphic characterizations of brain structures, claiming that they are not metaphorical but literal, then there is no metaphor for the first objection to worry about;14 we have already denied that there is any metaphor involved in talking of unconscious mental events. In other words, I want to argue that describing a cerebroceptive mechanism as "coding information", or "suppressing id- impulses", can be a literal and accurate description of what goes on, and is not illegitimate but irreducible anthropomorphization; nor does it generate intelligent man-analogues to vitiate the explanation. However, there is an important caveat to be issued first. I do not want to be taken to be defending all descriptions applied to id, ego, and superego; "The Unconscious, op. cit., pp. 100-1. "4Which does not, of course, mean that there are no worries to be felt about the scientific status of psychoanalysis. I am only claiming that there is no essential use of metaphor to add to these.</page><page sequence="8">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND ANALOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY 133 some of Freud's remarks about them are clearly and evidently meant to be taken as suggestive metaphor (often he signals such occasions by adding expressions like 'so to speak', or 'as it were'), and there is a sound reason for his making such metaphorical personifications. For id, ego, and super- ego were then-and still are-highly abstract, abstruse, difficult notions to grasp. Any means available to render them intelligible would be valuable; and an initial anthropomorphization serves this heuristic purpose well. The id, for example, behaves very like a demanding child (and indeed "in the beginning was the id"-ego and superego develop with increasing maturity); the superego is explicitly characterized in terms of harsh parents, for it is basically their norms that the child "introjects", or internalizes, according to Freudian theory. The ego, in turn, is easily identified with the "self", the more readily since all conscious events are ego events (although not conversely); indeed, much contemporary psychology, Ego psychology, ex- plicitly identifies ego and self. Consequently we can reach some under- standing of these entities initially, via this interpersonal analogy, using empathetic or intuitive understanding.15 Such familiarity is not, nor is it thought to be, "scientific": it is merely an heuristic introduction to highly complex theoretical posits. It is noteworthy that it is in his more popular works that Freud freely and liberally personifies his id-ego-superego triad, while in the more technical writings he restricts his descriptive vocabulary considerably, giving instead literal and (so I shall claim) accurate descrip- tion of their functions.16 Clearly there will be a fuzzy area where the literal/ metaphorical borderline will be hard to draw; but there is no sharp or clear distinction between this pair of notions in any domain. I hope that what follows will enable one to separate the legitimate, literal usages of the so- called "characteristically human" predicates from the clearly non-literal. To resume. The original charge, we remember, was that only a person, not any part of him, can literally "repress", "censor", "analyse", "store information", and the like. Just as a man, and not his hand, signs a cheque, so a human being, and not a part of his brain, is the one who can perform actions such as "displacing" or "suppressing" emotions. Crediting the ego or superego with such functions is a solecism, a use of anthropomorphic metaphor; with the personification of parts of the brain comes the threat of intelligent homunculi: an hypothesis which is not only literally false, but also makes for a circular analysis. In reply, I shall make a short detour into -5Heinz Hartmann develops this point: "The demarcation lines of the three systems ego, id, superego are geared to the typical conflicts of man: conflicts with the instinctual drives, with moral conscience, and with the outside world" ("Psychoanalysis as a Scientific Theory", in Hook (ed.), op. cit., pp. 3-37). 16The reader can check out this generalization for himself. In the popular work The Ego and the Id there is much extreme personification; see for example pp. 41-3 of volume IV of the Collected Papers. We can also find the same in The Interpretation of Dreams and Some Elementary Lessons in Psychoanalysis. But in any of the technical works it is hard to find any such instances which are not prefaced by 'so to speak', or 'as one might say'.</page><page sequence="9">134 K. V. WILKES the field of computer simulation, into science fiction, and into artificial intelligence. It is undeniably true to say of a washing machine that it cleans dishes by soaking, soaping, rinsing, and drying them. So also does a human being not possessing such a machine. Thus, a machine does something which humans also do (washes dishes), and, at one general level of description, "in the same way" as a human, namely by soaking, soaping, rinsing, and drying them. Certainly it does not perform these sub-tasks "in the same way" as a human being: isomorphism in function must be tied to a specified level of generality in the task-description. The point remains, however, that humans and simple machines undeniably share some abilities. A more sophisticated kind of machine plays chess; not only that, but it has the capacity to learn from its mistakes, to anticipate and guess the moves of its opponents, to select from a wide range of possible strategies (it is not "brute force" calculation-only a minute fraction of all the logically possible manoeuvres, namely the practically appropriate ones, are considered); it plans, adapts, and follows through strategies, tries to win and can lose. All this the human chess player does also; researchers in computer simulation would want to say that the computer carries out many of these sub-tasks (at some fairly detailed level of description) "in the same way" as the human.17 Chess playing computers (usually) cannot wash dishes, however, which their human opponents can; nevertheless the claim is made that any programmable task that a human being can carry out, a machine can be created to perform. And it is literally true to say of a machine programmed to q that it ys: there is no need and no justification for insulating the verb in raised eyebrow quotes, saying that it "s". We are not bound by any one of these machine performances, however impressive, to attribute intelligence or the capacity for thought to the com- puter. "Being intelligent" is not a programmable task or tasks-the role of a predication of 'intelligent' is rather adverbial; one may be said to 9 with or without intelligence. Further, intelligence and thinking are only predi- cated of entities which are capable of a fairly wide range of activity: extreme efficiency in a very few tasks is not enough. An adding-machine is not intelligent, however many bank-employees it makes redundant; and, con- versely, a man who could only add up, however prodigious his ability, could not be called intelligent if he could not converse, write letters, feed himself and so on-he would be a pitiful freak. If intelligence were simply a matter of ability to perform some highly complex and intricate task, then spiders, bats, migrating birds and our digestive systems would all be intelligent. In fact intelligence is not dependent solely or even largely upon extreme effi- ciency; it demands, rather, range of ability, flexibility, adaptiveness, the capacity to learn, and so on. 17Cf. H. A. Simon, "Thinking by Computers", in Colodny (ed.), Mind and Cosmos (Pittsburgh, 1966), pp. 3-22.</page><page sequence="10">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND ANALOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY 135 Suppose we have a highly sophisticated computer, one built to learn and carry out a wide range of activities. It cleans shoes, plays chess, does the accounts, minds the children, advises on the stock market, selects ripe tomatoes from the grocer, and similar tasks. Here we have a wide range of "blur" with persons. We can, if we like, salvage our integrity by noting that it cannot sulk, fall in love, become exhilarated by the Northern Lights, play Chopin with feeling-such are not programmable tasks. Nevertheless, with such a machine we would be justified in saying that it did something intelligently, or perhaps stupidly; a new one-upmanship could be born: "My computer learns faster than yours", "Well, I saw your computer behaving remarkably stupidly when it was mending a fuse yesterday". Again, when faced with a conflict-situation-say, a squalling child and a need to catch the last post-it might be said to act over-hastily, without thinking hard enough. Such attributions-adverbial comments on the manner of perfor- mance-would not be anthropomorphic. We can make literal attributions of many psychological states to it. We have a discovery: certain predicates hitherto restricted to humans or the higher animals may be true of sophisti- cated computers also. Let us turn back to the ego. It is no more "human" than our advanced robot-indeed, far less so. This is to say that it shares far fewer predicates with us than does the robot. The id and superego are even more restricted in scope. It would be absurd to list all the properties that humans have which these entities do not, for such a list would range from falling with constant acceleration when dropped from a height to attempting to discover perpetual motion. Yet they are capable of some highly complex tasks, quite as intricate in their own way as is middle-game strategy in chess. The inference I obviously want to make is, of course, that we ought to allow such predications to be completely literal, while maintaining that the ego and superego are no more man-analogues by virtue of such predications than are adding-machines and our digestive systems by virtue of the predi- cates that can be truly made of them. Nor are they intelligent (or unintel- ligent). Even the attribution of intentional concepts, such as trying, or of psychological states, such as suffering anxiety, does not carry with it any implication of intelligence. The situation is evidently no different when it is the entities of physio- logical psychology that are at issue. For example, consider a fairly well- understood complex of ailments-the phenomena of aphasia, alexia, apraxia, and agnosia. These are the effects of brain lesions, and have been thoroughly studied;18 it is known that individuatable brain masses, such as the associa- tion cortex, Broca's area, Wernicke's area, plus the interconnecting neural fibres, are some of the significant analysanda here. To explain a phenomenon l8The facts are most digestibly presented for the layman in N. Geschwind, "Anatomy and the Higher Functions of the Brain", in Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. IV (New York, 1963), pp. 98-136.</page><page sequence="11">136 K. V. WILKES such as aphasia, one needs to employ a vocabulary which speaks of the associating or collating functions of the association cortex, the breakdown in the transmission of information from Wernicke's area to Broca's area, and so on: the terminology is exactly that used in an interpersonal com- munication context. But again we need not be troubled by accusations of anthropomorphism, analogy, or change of meaning; and the question of the attribution of intelligence or thought to any of these entities does not arise -the functions of these brain masses are too highly specialized, too inflexible, for that. Neurophysiology can even attribute Dennett's bete noire, decoding, to some neural complex or mechanism: for since decoding is a programmable task, men, machines and nervous tissue might all be capable of it, whether or not they can truly be described as intelligent. The difference between, say, the ego and Broca's area is, of course, that the latter but not the former has been physically located; the constitution of the ego may very well not be a locatable brain mass, but might be something highly abstract-a system of relations between pattern-properties of neural excitation, for instance- but whatever realization in brain tissue it may have, this is as yet not under- stood at all.19 That the ego does have a neurophysiological realization of some kind remains an indispensable article of faith as yet. But this is also true of many of the theoretical entities postulated by physiological psychology such as "information storage mechanisms"; and the gene is a well-known example of an item which was originally introduced as an unknown X with certain functions, and only later physically located. IV Finally, some summary and concluding remarks. It seems that one must agree that there is no adequately stable (far less precise) distinction between analogic (or anthropomorphic) and literal attributions of terms-adequate, that is, to sustain charges of illicit mentalizing of the brain. So long as we continue to produce machines capable of performing tasks that hitherto man alone has been able to do, we shall ipso facto be extending the range of items which are capable of such tasks. Thus, for any programmable task q, it will be false to say that q-ing is, after all, a "characteristically human" attribute. This, it should be stressed, is true even of tasks that humans can only perform with extensive use of intelligence. A human has to be intelligent to derive theorems in mathematics; but computers have been built which can do it without being intelligent. Analogously, men need strength in order to lift 100 lb. crates, but a crane or fork-lift truck does not lift crates by being strong. Even though muscular strength and intelligence may be necessary conditions for the human performance of some tasks, it 19Indeed, the Freudian ego may never be physically located. As more is discovered by both psychoanalysis and neurophysiology, the description and specification of the theoretical entities of psychoanalysis will be constantly modified; as yet they are very crudely delineated. It is the theoretical entities of an advanced, Utopian psychology -the descendants of the current items-that will be found to be reducible to the theoretical entities of an equally Utopian neurophysiology.</page><page sequence="12">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND ANALOGY IN PSYCHOLOGY 137 does not follow that they are also prerequisites for the performance of those tasks by everything else. So even if a mass of nervous tissue did (literally) have the capacity to decode neural signals, it would not follow that it was intelligent, despite the fact that human decoders have to be; decoding machines, if such exist, are neither intelligent nor unintelligent. So not only are there no man-analogues in the brain, but also there is no intelligence attributed to parts of it. We know as yet little about the detailed operations of the brain; what neural chains are, and what they are not, capable of doing must be a matter for discovery, not arbitrary fiat.
