An extension of the circulation of microscope slides was how they became part of lantern exhibition culture. This article considers an early example of the adoption of microscope lantern show conventions by another medium, the cinema. F. Mar- tin Duncan, who was employed by Charles Urban to produce a series of popular- science films beginning in 1903, brought his experience with microphotography to bear on the challenge of adapting cinema to the purpose of public instruction. Duncan s first series of films, entitled "The Unseen World," demonstrated both profound links to the display tra- dition of the lantern lecture as well as the transformation of that tradition by the cinemas representational possibilities. KEYWORDS - Charles Urban, F. Martin Duncan, microcinematography, "The Unseen World," lantern lecture, education Introduction As liana Löwy notes in her introduction to this special issue, micro- scope slides occupy a "unique 'in between' position" as objects that, al- ternatively, can be viewed "as body parts, highly transformed artifacts, a technological interference between the microscope and the organism, or unique entities that produce sui generis effects and are depositories of spe- cific knowledge." This article will extend the insight that microscope slides inhabit an intermediary region by considering the question of exhibition, and in particular how the exhibition of microscopic views in lantern cul- ture was transformed by the emergence of cinema. The "special effects" that microscope slides are able to produce in this context are linked both © 2013 Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohm</page><page sequence="2">320 OLIVER GAYCKEN to their ability to be projected - which was already part of their place in lantern-slide exhibition culture - as well as their ability to capture move- ment. In other words, when the cinema emerged, it injected movement into lantern-slide exhibition, transforming the slide from Präparat, or still image, into Bewegungspräparat, or living picture.1 Projection culture was a permeable cultural zone, and the projected image allowed for a wide range of exhibitions and responses. Cinema scholars have explored how nineteenth-century travel lectures that relied on lantern slides contributed to the formation of the cinematic travelogue (Musser 1990; Barber 1993; Peterson 2013). This article will consider lantern culture's role in the for- mation of another nonfiction cinema genre, the popular-science film. The Unseen World: "Living pictures of nature's closest secrets" In 1902, Charles Urban, a prominent cinema producer, hired the mi- crophotographer and naturalist Francis Martin Duncan to produce films on various natural history subjects.2 Duncan was the son of Dr. P. Martin Duncan, the multifaceted scientist and popularizer who edited Cassell's Natural History (1883), a profusely illustrated, six- volume reference work. Duncan helped his father with photography for Cassell's Natural History and soon established himself in the field of popular science pub- lishing in his own right. His First Steps in Photo-Micrography: A Hand- Book for Novices (1902) was number 23 in the series "The Amateur Pho- tographer's Library." In this book, Duncan provided information about how to obtain images of the "beauties" of zoology and botany through the microscope for the interested amateur, who could be a medical stu- dent, a practicing doctor, or a hobbyist. This publication prefigured the most prominent of Duncan's film subjects produced for the Charles Ur- ban Trading Company, "The Unseen World," and can serve as an initial indication of how Duncan's films for Urban relied on previous media schema. Urban began press preview screenings of his new film program in ear- ly July of 1903 at his offices at 48 Rupert Street, London. The first pub- lished press review appeared in The Daily Mail of July 10th under the title "New Camera Wonders: Living Pictures of Nature's Closest Secrets," 1 Projections of moving microscopic images did exist prior to the cinema, via the solar micro- scope, the oxy-hydrogen microscope, and tank slides. The predominant form of microscopic views during the latter half of the nineteenth century, however, was the static lantern slide. On projections of moving images of microscopic projections before cinema, see Altick (1973). 2 The following account of F. Martin Duncan's work for Charles Urban is drawn from Gaycken (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="3">"LIVING PICTURE" 321 and other newspapers such as the Daily Express , Le Figaro, the Morning Post, The Amateur Photographer, and Focus soon followed with articles on the innovative motion picture program.3 F. Martin Duncan himself wrote an article that appeared in the July 10th issue of the British Journal of Photography entitled "The Application of Animated Photography to Science and Education." These reviews provide an initial glimpse both of the program that Urban and Duncan had devised and how they pre- sented it. The first screenings of his films were construed for a music- hall audience, as an article in The Amateur Photographer indicates, "[Ur- ban] has succeeded in making a number of cinematographic records of microscopic observations, so that it is now possible to watch upon the screen the actual processes of protoplasmic life, and show a large audi- ence what has hitherto only been observable by the scientist."4 Another notable aspect of these reviews is how they establish what Yuri Tsivian has termed "tropes of reception" (Tsivian 1998). Duncan's images prompted a variety of responses, ranging from fascination to ex- tensive analogizing. The reviews as well as Urban's publicity frequently remark on the extreme manipulation of space that the microcinemato- graphic films involved; the magnification ranged from 2,200,000 to 76,000,000 times when the films were viewed on a 20- to 25 -foot screen. This almost unfathomable distortion of scale presented spectators with a visual experience that was difficult to understand on its own terms. The Daily Express reviewer, for instance, evokes a pastoral image in his de- scription, "More remarkable still are the pictures of the veins in the web of a frog's foot and in the point of a leaf. You see blood rushing through the frog's artery like water down a mill-stream."5 The Daily Mail review writes, "Mr. Urban's greatest achievement, however, is the series of films which reproduce on the screen as clearly as a bioscope picture shows the movement of a crowd the actual processes of protoplasmic life in a bit of common water- weed."6 The comparison's emphasis is on the clarity of the representation, an aspect of the cinematographic image that was frequently singled out for praise during this period. Equally intriguing, however, is the more fundamental play with scale upon which the anal- ogy relies, how the microbial view becomes analogous to human crowds as seen on film.7 The Daily Express review continues its reaction to the 3 These articles are reprinted in the booklet "Reprints of Press Articles Re: The Urban-Duncan Micro-Bioscope: Series of Animated Pictures of Nature s Closest Secrets n.d.

This image finds a contemporary deploy-</page><page sequence="4">322 OLIVER GAYCKEN preview screening by spinning out a remarkable extended metaphor that first envisions the films as political allegories and then speculates about the possible ramifications of the play of scale that the films raise: These very bodies of ours support and nurture as crowded a life as throngs the outer surface of the globe. Through our veins wander tribes of Bedouin bacteria, possessed, we doubt not, of recognized forms of communal existence. The pain which we call colic may conceivably be due to a South African war of bacilli, and a twinge of toothache to some upheaval in microbe politics equivalent to a change in our fiscal policy. The suggestion sounds ludicrous, but so litde do we know of the lesser life that it is well within the range of possibility. If man's entity indeed began as an amoeba in the primeval slime, there is no law of evolution which forbids the possibility of his nurturing in his veins to-day a microbe that millions of years hence shall attain to an infinitely higher degree of civilisation than he will ever reach.8 In this passage the body becomes a planet, and microbial processes are compared to geopolitical struggles, as per one of the prevalent versions of Darwinism, which emphasized an understanding of nature as a great struggle for existence. In addition, by manipulating the scale of space, the scale of time becomes itself something with which to experiment, leading to envisioning how a microbe may have evolved into humanity's better against the backdrop of deep time. A corollary of this analogy is that when viewed through an instrument of distantiation such as the cinema, human activity could seem as strange as microbial life, which belongs to a tradition of the reception of projected microscope images.9 Other reactions speculated about the films' function in the contempo- rary media ecology. "As the principle purpose in life of most of these tiny organisms seems to be to devour those belonging to a different species, Mr. Urban's photographs should show plenty of excitement, and we may expect such advertisements as 'Great Batde of Microbes now on - 'Or- rible Slaughter.' We only fear less [sic] the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty of Animals will step in and stop these exhibitions."10 The ten- dency that this review emphasizes toward scenes of spectacular action, particularly of animals fighting or eating one another, is an important cor- rective to Urban's rhetoric of high-mindedness and class. As the dropped "h" from the hypothetical advertisement indicates, this reviewer did not take Urban's pronouncements about the elevating intentions of his films ment in work by Michal Rovner, including DataZone (2003) and Culture Plate XY (2003), which con- tain videos of crowds projected into Petri dishes and onto surfaces; see Vincent (2003). 8 E.P.S., "Pictures of the Unseen," Daily Express , 15 July 1903; quoted in "Reprints," 4. 9 The trope of viewing the earth from the alien perspective provided by optical devices has a long heritage; see Wilson (1995) and Aklon (2002). 10 Focus; quoted in "Reprints," 8.</page><page sequence="5">"LIVING PICTURE" 323 particularly seriously, or, rather, kept the audience and exhibitor for the show in mind instead of considering only Urban's own publicity. One aspect of the film program, of course, was significandy different from preceding shows. As the Daily Express writes, "The chief impres- sion [the films] leave behind is an extraordinary sense of movement. Rest, repose, stillness, seem absolutely opposed to all principles of Nature. At the very moment of death new life in some form or other is born."11 In this emphasis on movement, the review recalls the reactions to the earli- est cinema projections, which in 1903 were still a matter of recent mem- ory. By extending the cinema's purview into new realms, "The Unseen World" reactivated the wonder that attended the emergence of cinema. This emphasis on movement also signals a crucial difference between two traditions, that of static microscope slides and that of the projection of "living" microscopic preparations.12 Douglas Cox, the manager of the Alhambra Theatre, agreed to a screening of Urban's series of science films during the relatively low- risk summer season.13 The show was billed as "'The Unseen World', A Series of Microscopic Studies, Photographed by means of The Urban- Duncan Micro-Bioscope" and was exhibited publicly for the first time at the Alhambra on 17 August 1903. One account of the opening per- formance recalls that, "Scientists were present in great number, journal- ists in force, a crowded house. Enthusiasm was the order of the night, and the great London press was unanimous in praise the next morning [...]. The program was presented every night to delighted audiences for a period of nine months, and proved one of the principle attractions at the Alhambra."14 Although the number of scientists in attendance may be exaggerated along the lines of the Daily News review, the press reac- tion was, indeed, considerable, and Urban's skills at self-promotion and archival instincts led him to reprint pages of press reviews in his cata- logues. An Alhambra program of the screening does not seem to survive, but comparing descriptions of the films in the reviews to the descriptions of them in Urban's first catalogue allows the certain identification of the following tides: Cheese Mites (cat. 2513, 50ft), Circulation of Blood in the Frog's Foot (cat. 2508, 75ft), The Pugilistic Toads and the Tortoise Ref- 11 Daily Express , quoted in "Reprints," 4. 12 For more on the importance of the movement/stillness dichotomy for an understanding of sci- ence and film, see Curtis (2004) and Landecker (2005). 13 "Considering the time of year, the enormous business done at the Alhambra last week was truly re- markable" (The Referee , 23 August 1903; quoted in List of Urban Film Subjects [London: Charles Urban Trading Company, 1903], 91; Charles Urban Papers, National Media Museum, Bradford, UK; URB 10-1; hereafter abbreviated List. This catalogue is also available on Early Rare Filmmakers' Catalogues: 1896- 1913 , collected by the British Film Institute [London: World Microfilms Publications, 1983], reel 6). 14 Daily Express , quoted in "Reprints," 4.</page><page sequence="6">324 OLIVER GAYCKEN eree (cat. 2022, 60ft), The Fresh-Water Hydra (cat. 2505, 75ft), Chameleons Feeding (cat. 2013, 100ft), The Circulation of Protoplasm in the Waterweed (cat. 2507, 75ft), and Typhoid Bacteria (cat. 2510, 50ft). The Meal of the American Toad (cat. 2012, 75ft.), The Boa Constrictor (cat. 2014, 200ft) are likely titles, although the scenes described in the reviews could also refer to other tides, such as The Toad's Luncheon (cat. 2011, 75ft.) or The Greedy Toad (cat. 2010, 75ft) for the former tide; and The Boa Constrictor Crush- ing and Swallowing a Rat (cat. 2036, 100ft) or A Snake in the Grass (cat. 2024, 60ft.) for the second. In addition, The Busy Bee (cat. 2020, 450ft), "a series of 15 pictures showing every phase of Bee Culture," formed the "second part" of the program. 15 The total footage of the show was at least 1000ft, which would have meant a runtime of roughly twenty minutes at the likely projection speed of 16 frames per second. The press reactions to the first public shows contained similar tropes of reception as those generated by the preview screenings as well as gen- erating a number of new ones. There were numerous citations of the approval of cultural authorities who spoke out in favor of the Alham- bra show, praising, for example, "a series of fifteen pictures dealing with the life of the bee which were sufficiently charming to have engaged the admiration of M. Maeterlinck, sufficiendy instructive to have pleased Dr. Watts, and sufficiendy wonderful to excite the marvel of a world."16 Alongside effusive praise, another recurring theme in the reviews was the sense of novelty that the show provoked. The Standard declared, "most shows may be described as novel, but none are more entided to the ad- jective than that presented for the first time last night at the Alhambra." The Era remarked, "it is as beautiful as it is novel and curious," and the Daily Telegraph observed, "Science has just added a new marvel to the marvelous powers of the Bioscope." As novel as the "Unseen World" seemed, it also evoked echoes of previous entertainments. While stressing the novelty of the show, the reviewer for the Free Lance did so by making a connection to a mid- nineteenth-century venue, the Polytechnic. "All last week the house was crowded nighdy and this I should think is largely due to the novelty. What a sensation it would have been for the Polytechnic in the old days if it could have had something of this kind [...]." 17 Another review referred to the Polytechnic as well: 15 Quoted in List , 66. The mention of the bee series forming the second part of the program is contained in The Era. 16 MornitiQ Post , quoted in "Reprints," 10. 17 Free Lance , 21 August 1903; quoted in List , 91.</page><page sequence="7">"LIVING PICTURE" 325 I wonder who remembers that the original Alhambra was a competitor of the old Polytechnic, called the Panopticon, opened with prayer, operated under a Royal charter, and filled with scientific toys? It does not matter much; but the thought occurred to me when I inspected Mr. Douglas Cox's collection of scientific toys in the shape of animated photographs the other evening. Science, to be sure, has progressed a litde since 1854. The microscopic and bioscopic studies of blood in circulation, vegetation in growth, cheese in animation, and so forth, that nighdy enthrall the Alhambra audience are weird and fascinating.18 While both reviews implied that the Alhambra show outdid what the Polytechnic offered, the very fact of comparison attests to enduring similarities. The Polytechnic, which was founded in 1838 and received a royal charter in 1839, initially devoted itself to popular lectures and demonstrations of scientific devices for lay audiences. Its commitment to the high-minded aim of public education, however, contained a strain of indulgence in what Richard Altick has described as the "popular appe- tite for the light, sweet tarts of amusement rather than the nutritious loaf of instruction" (Altick 1978, 386). 19 The "Unseen World" thus evoked a somewhat familiar mode of screen entertainment, with images that re- sembled both the public lantern lecture and the solar or oxyhydrogen microscope show. The reviewer for The Referee wrote, "By means of these pictures the management has contrived to 'combine instruction with amusement' for the grown-up Sandfords and Mertons who have patronized the Alham- bra, and to administer, as it were, several sugar-coated science pills."20 And the reviewer for The People remarks, "The way in which the Alham- bra audiences watch the screen during the presentation of the pictures of insect life is significant. Here there is something new to so many that if the educational pill is gilded, as it is at the Alhambra, that is so much gained from the entertainment point of view."21 Both of these images - the sugar-coated science pill and the gilded educational pill - contain a signal ambivalence. The "Unseen World" provided a type of medicine for what ailed the culture of the music hall, but in order to have a purchase on that milieu, some accommodation to popular taste was necessary. This senti- ment provides an excellent encapsulation of the negotiations involved in the circulation and differing reception of microcinematographic images. 18 Weekly Dispatch , 23 August 1903; quoted in List , 92. 19 See also Altick (1978, 363-389) where, among many other facts, Altick mentions that John Henry Pepper lectured on a number of subjects at the Polytechnic, including the purity of such things as Burton's ale. 20 The Referee , quoted in List , 91. 21 The People , 23 August 1903 ; quoted in List, 92.</page><page sequence="8">326 OLIVER GAYCKEN One reaction to this dual appeal was to separate the cultural elements that the "Unseen World" fused. Nature, for instance, was of the opin- ion that "Those interested in science need not spend the evening there [at the Alhambra]; they could go to see just what concerned them."22 Instead of being seen as a compromise, however, the show's bifurcated appeal could also be appreciated as having its own particular strength, as the reviewer for the Morning Post recognized: As a music hall turn, last night's production was an unqualified success. Peo- ple like to be interested, and they don't in the least mind being interested by something worth knowing, if only someone will provide it for them. And surely the performance must also show that the usefulness of animated pictures is not limited to amusement, but that developed on considered lines it must be of value to science, not only as an automatic and unerring record of experiments, but as a potent aid in the dissemination of knowledge.23 This view of the cinema signaled an increase of its purview, from a role as the "retina of the scientist" to a persuasive force, from inscription to projection device. The strategy of elevating the status of the motion picture also met with a more jaundiced reception. The Alhambra shows could be seen as another instance of an onslaught of ephemeral enter- tainments that catered to an interest in scientific innovation as a remark in The Morning Advertiser underscores, "The 'Unseen World' is a sci- entific novelty, calculated to create a sensation for many weeks."24 This emphasis on the show's transitory nature adds a shade of meaning to its much-prized novelty. While the "Unseen World" made certain gestures toward an extra-market value for its contents, it remained subject to the same law of obsolescence as other popular entertainments. These observations about the program's reception need to be juxta- posed with descriptions of the individual films and how they were or- dered into a program. The program consisted of two parts. Two things seem worth mentioning about these titles and their organization. First of all, the microcinematic films and the more comic films about animal life were interspersed. In one strand of reception, the microcinematographic films receive the pride of place, to the extent that "The Unseen World" sometimes is described as consisting only of microscopic views. Urban himself is largely responsible for this reception, since the section in the 1904 catalogue entitled "The Unseen World" consists solely of microcin- ematographic films. 22 Nature y 27 August 1903; quoted in List, 93. 23 Morning Post , quoted in "Reprints," 10. 24 The Morning Advertiser , quoted in List , 92.</page><page sequence="9">"LIVING PICTURE" 327 Contemporary audiences responded with as much interest and delight to the "trivial anthropomorphism" of the films as they were impressed by the microcinematic films' unusual aesthetic. This emphasis on the presence of the non-microcinematographic films in "The Unseen World" should not be seen as an attempt to detract from the importance of the views through the microscope. However, keeping sight of the show's alternation between the micro- and the macroscopic leads to questions about the appeal and the con- text for the non-microcinematographic films. The ambivalence in the show's subtitle, "Revealing Nature's Closest Secrets by Means of the Urban-Dun- can Micro-Bioscope," is revealing in this respect. On the one hand, "closest" refers to proximity, to the literal distance that the microscope bridges, bring- ing human perception to the level of the previously invisible. The closeness, however, also refers to a sense of an intimacy with nature, an observational proximity that the camera makes possible. It is in this sense that the viewer of "The Unseen World" becomes acquainted not only with microbes, but the habits of the frog, the chameleon, the boa constrictor. The closeness, in other words, is not solely a matter of magnification, but also a method of observa- tion. In this sense, closeness is a matter of understanding better.25 "The Unseen World" as intermedial entertainment As with most films from this period, the structure and content of "The Unseen World" drew from other media practices. The lantern lecture was a common way for popular science to reach audiences from the mid-nine- teenth to early twentieth centuries, and "The Unseen World" could be described as an animated photography lecture.26 The similarities between the two forms of screen entertainment begin with the fact that the lan- tern and film show both consisted of a series of photographic images pro- jected onto a screen. Beyond this fundamental resemblance, "The Unseen World" relied on the more specific context of lantern lectures that includ- ed photomicrographs. So a lecture on human physiology could contain a photomicrograph of a fly's eye, included as an illustration of the various possible types of eye structures. And certain lantern lectures, such as The Inhabitants of a Drop of Water under the Microscope or Arthur J. Doherty's Bacteria; and an Hour with the Microscope, consisted almost entirely of views taken through a microscope.27 25 See Gunning (1997). 26 See Musser (1990) and Barber (1993) on cinema's relationship with lantern culture. 27 Titles cited are from the Magic Lantern Society Library, whose titles are consultable at www. magiclantern.org.uk.

Furneaux, "The Human Body; or, the House We Live in" (Magic Lantern Society collection, 90796).</page><page sequence="10">328 OLIVER GAYCKEN The presence of the lecturer provided another link to the exhibition strategies of the lantern-lecture format. Not only did F. Martin Duncan lecture with "The Unseen World" but reviews also preserved impres- sions of his lecturing style. These references make a distinction between Duncan's performance versus a typical popular science lantern lecture. '"The popular lecture,' with its accompanying slides, would be regarded as intolerable. At the Alhambra the living picture of animal life, with its brief description given in a resonant voice, is quite another story."28 The Court Circular mentioned the lecturer in both of its reviews of the show, commenting first that "The subjects, which are reflected upon a huge screen, are so highly magnified that cheese-mites appear as large as sofa-cushions, and as rapacious as crocodiles, and they are described in a concise and cheery manner that is quite to the taste of spectators. "29 The second review stated, "The views are wonderfully sharp and clear, and the orator, who discourses on the pictures as they are thrown upon the screen, is brief in his remarks and to the point."30 Based on these com- ments, Duncan's comments were notably brief and, as the word "cheery" suggests, humorous. The "The Unseen World" thus seems to have repre- sented a departure from what was associated with lantern-slide lectures, appealing to an audience that demanded diversion and amusement in addition to edification. Lantern culture also informed the "The Unseen World" because lan- tern slides were a prominent component of Urban's products. (Figure 1) In catalogues from 1903 to 1905, a separate section was dedicated to the company's inventory of lantern slides, which increased markedly during this period. The slide inventory of the 1903 catalogue, 258 slides, increased to 596 slides in the 1905 catalogue.31 This co-presence of slides and films in the catalogues indicate that Urban and Duncan saw lantern slides and films as functioning together, a supposition that is borne out by an introductory text to the lantern-slide section of the 1905 catalogue.

These Films and Slides have been specially prepared to meet the requirements of Educational and Scientific Establishments, Lecturers, etc., and are throughout of the highest standard of perfection. We were the first to apply Animated Pho- tography to the recording of living Microscopic organisms, to Zoology, Botany, Physics, Electricity, Entomology, Anthropology, etc., and the Urban-Duncan Mi- cro-Bioscope Films are in demand all over the world. Modern educational meth- ods all prove the importance of teaching through the agency of the eye as well as the ear. A lecture or lesson demonstrated by a graphic series of pictures remains vividly impressed on the mind. - F. Martin-Duncan, F.R.H.S., Director Scientific and Educational Department.32 As the reference to "modern educational methods" indicates, Urban and Duncan saw their production of optical media as participating in the burgeoning interest in what would come to be called "visual education. "33 Lantern slides figured not as something for motion pictures to overcome but as a companion medium in the effort to create a more vivid method to teach "through the agency of the eye." Another indication of how well "The Unseen World" fit in with mod- ern theories of education was evident from its relation to the nature- study movement (on the rise of nature study, see Kohlstedt 2005 and Armitage 2009). A little more than a month after its public debut, the program was shown at the Home Counties Nature-Study Exhibition in Burlington Gardens, and advertised in the following words: Fig. 1 - Lantern slide as reproduced in Revised List of High-Class Original Copyrighted Bioscope Films (London: The Charles Urban Trading Company, 1905), 50; from Early Rare Filmmakers Catalogues: 1896-1913 , collected by the British Film Institute (Lon- don: World Microfilms Publications, 1983), reel 6. 32 Revised List, 8. 33 For more on the discourse of visual education in the period of early cinema, see Gaycken (20 11).</page><page sequence="12">330 OLIVER GAYCKEN Tickets at special rates for teachers and pupils. The programme includes confer- ences for teachers on practical methods of nature-study in elementary and sec- ondary schools. The latest scientific developments of the Urban-Duncan micro- bioscope will be shown on the evenings of Friday and Saturday, and well-known lecturers on natural history subjects, such as Mr. Douglas English, Mr. Richard Kearton, Mr. R. B. Lodge, and Mr. Oliver Pike will give addresses from time to time, and exhibit their slides during the exhibition. (Anon. 1903a, 638) Kearton and Pike both became noteworthy nature filmmakers, and their exhibition of slides at this event is a further indication of the fluidity between lantern and cinema culture in this period. A report on the ex- hibition noted, "Mr. Martin Duncan proved the great possibilities of the Urban Duncan micro-bioscope for recording natural history observa- tions in the ordinary way and under the microscope" (Anon. 1903b, 18). Duncan's photomicrographic skills provided another opportunity for synergy between a specialized branch of photographic culture and the early popular science film. Duncan's aforementioned book on micro- photography from 1902 contained a section on the microphotography of bacteria, where he stressed the difficulty of obtaining quality images. "The production of successful photographs of bacteria is the highest at- tainment in photo-micrography, requiring at once great manipulative skill and patience" (Duncan 1902, 50). Duncan made a vague claim to innovation in this respect shortly before the first public screenings of "The Unseen World." "Animated photographs of all the different forms of bacilli and other microscopic organisms are now being produced by means of a method which I have worked out" (Duncan 1903, 549). The catalogues make claims for how much time and money the micro-bio- scope subjects required, stating that the system was "only achieved after much patient labor and no small expense" and "the result of long and patient research by our scientific staff" (Kleine 1910, 42; Urban 1908, 66). There were two specific issues related to microcinematography that were difficult to overcome. One was illumination. "The chief problem to overcome was that of light. It was necessary to turn a ray of 2,000 candle power onto the speck that was being magnified and photographed, and yet not to destroy it by heat. In solving this problem a great scientific triumph of the highest value in many directions was accomplished" (Kleine 1910, 42). Beyond this problem, which Etienne-Jules Marey for one had already addressed, was the issue of the size and transparency of the bacteria: The greatest difficulty in the way of investigating living bacteria is the close af- finity of their refractive index to the media in which they are cultivated. After months of experiment with various optical formulae, our scientific staff suc- ceeded in finding a combination of lenses which permit accurate examination of living, unstained bacteria. By the usual methods, particular movements have to</page><page sequence="13">"LIVING PICTURE" 331 be waited for, often without success, as in the "clumping" of Typhoid bacilli; but by the Micro-Kinematograph, pictures of these germs, magnified 850 diameters, may now be projected onto the screen in all stages of growth, and in resdess, unceasing movement, while films presenting the necessary clumping can easily be prepared. (Kleine 1910, 42) A film that demonstrates Duncan's abilities in transferring his knowl- edge of the conjunction of photography and microscopy to the new medium is Typhoid Bacteria, which the catalogue described in the fol- lowing words: "This remarkable film shows hundreds of typhoid and other disease germs found in sewage contaminated water, in all stages of growth, and in resdess and unceasing movement. Note. - This is the first time these germs have been photographed alive, the usual method em- ployed in examining and studying the germs being to kill, dry and stain the same. Magnified 850 diameters."34 Here, too, cinema animates the previously static images provided by photomicrography, indicating both the continuities as well as the innovations of the new medium. Together these factors demonstrate how "The Unseen World" was located at the confluence of several contexts. The show was modeled on the lantern lecture and resembled a natural-history lantern show. It was immediately rec- ognized as relevant to the nature study movement, and some of its films at- test to Duncan's involvement in scientific networks of early-twentieth-century microscopy. Situated between older traditions of scientific display and a new mass cultural phenomenon, "The Unseen World" was at once particularly modern while also relying implicitly on established display traditions. "A fine attack of the Jim-Jams" A characteristic response to "The Unseen World" was horrified fasci- nation, and the microcinematographic films proved particularly disturb- ing. A review in the Sunday Special provided a typical reaction: A visit to the Alhambra last Monday evening resulted in a firm resolve never to eat cheese or drink water again. A microscopic examination of the former, magni- fied to the size of a Bioscope screen, revealed one of the most blood-curdling pic- tures imaginable with mites of various shapes and sizes, but all equally hideous, prowling around in the most businesslike manner. As regards the fresh water hy- dra, he was a horror built on more graceful lines; but to see the tentacles shooting out for food was sufficient to shake the confidence of the most rabid teetotaler.35 34 List, 86. 35 Sunday Special , 23 August 1903; quoted in List , 92.</page><page sequence="14">332 OLIVER GAYCKEN Cheese Mîtes, and The Fresh-Water Hydra revealed an invisible world that was both fascinating and threatening. The extension of the bounda- ries of the visible resulted in a defamiliarization of everyday objects, like cheese and water. Another reviewer wrote: No micro-bioscopes and no Alhambra in Cornaro 's days; else Cornaro might not have been a centenarian. I think it would have prostrated, if not killed, the dear old gendeman to see those many-armed, angry, spiteful little mites waging war against one another in cheese and water. Heavens, what combatants, what war- riors! Many an abstainer has gone shuddering out of the Alhambra, and many a cheesemonger foresees failure.36 The Micro-Bioscope revealed something considered inanimate as in fact teeming with life, calling forth, verily, a gut reaction. The writer for the Topical Times provided the most colorful language about his bodily re- action to the microscopic films. "Anyone in want of a fine attack of the jim-jams cannot do better than hurry up to the Alhambra, but if you feel a bit 'jumpy' I should advise you to leave these latest exhibits of the Charles Urban Trading Company severely alone. There is also a screen full of cheese mites magnified to the size of turtles. Ugh! "37 Suggestions abounded that cheese mongers might have reservations about Cheese Mites: "Purveyors and consumers of cheese will probably not relish the exposure of life in that article of diet, and some of the other displays are a trifle uncanny."38 An article in the Daily Express en- tided "Microbic Monsters" contained the following imagined dialogue, "'Well, this is the last time that I ever eat cheese!' said the man in the stalls. 'If you want to be logical,' said his friend, 'it would be the last time that you ever drank water.'"39 Unsurprisingly, given these reactions of disgust, a story arose about how Cheese Mites was censored at the behest of the cheese industry, although no evidence of such repression exists (see Mathews 1994, 3-4, for the statement that Cheese Mites was the first instance of film censorship in Britain). The persistence of this anecdote, however, attests to Cheese Mites' long-term notoriety; it remains the best- known film from "The Unseen World."40 What made Cheese Mites more memorable than The Fresh-Water Hy- 36 Morning Leader , 24 August 1903; quoted in List, 92.

Visually, the hydra and the bacteria simply may not have generated as much displeasure as the mites, since the appearance of the mites tapped into the perennial power of arachnophobia. Another reason for the film's enduring appeal, however, relates to the particular cinematic treatment it received. Quite soon after the initial screenings, a review mentioned a second shot in its description of Cheese Mites. "Now the Alhambra has got one of the most fascinating turns I have seen in the shape of a series of bioscoped microphotographs showing all sorts of things that we have seen under a microscope. For example, a picture of a man eating cheese is thrown on the screen and then a second picture of the cheese showing the mites actually moving."41 (Figure 2) By includ- ing an introductory shot that depicted a man, played by none other than F. Martin Duncan himself, eating a piece of cheese, Urban and Duncan visualized the experience of consuming living, microscopic creatures. The initial description of the multi-shot version of Cheese Mites makes the spectator response being modeled quite clear. 2501 Special . . . CHEESE MITES A gentleman reading the paper and seated at lunch, suddenly detects something the matter with his cheese. He examines it with his magnifying ¿ass, starts up and flings the cheese away, frightened at the sight of the creeping mites which his magnifying glass reveals. A ripe piece of Stilton, the size of a shilling, will contain several hundred cheese mites. In this remarkable film, the mites are seen crawling and creeping about in all directions, looking like great uncanny crabs, bristling with long spiny hairs and legs. Magnified 30 diameters on film. Length 150ft.42 The startled reaction of the man with the magnifying glass could be classed with depictions of the rube, as in Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show (Edison and Porter, 1902), which presumed an audience that knew better than to be alarmed by the novelties of the cinematic illusion. F. Martin Duncan's performance evokes this tradition to a certain extent, although his exaggerated gestures also suggest an ironic dimension. The catalogue's description of the mites as "uncanny" seems linked to magnification; the mites look like crabs, but distorted and made "great," which is to say giant.43 This sense of the uncanny, however, is also related 41 "Science in a Music Hall," The Tatler Aug. 26 / Sept. 2, 1903; quoted in List, 94. 42 Listy 84. The description of the man starting up and flinging the cheese away suggests that a version of the film with a third shot might have existed. 43 In a later edition of the catalogue, the mites are described as a "large and happy family," presum- ably because there are different sizes of mites (papa mite, baby mite). In this version, the description of the shot where the investigator looks at the piece of cheese has changed as well; here he places the cheese under his magnifying glass because he is "prompted by curiosity" (Urban 1908, 67; part of the series "Through the Microscope," 2122, 560ft.).</page><page sequence="16">334 OLIVER GAYCKEN Fig. 2a, 2b - Video stills from Cheese Mites (F.

The reaction to cinematic motion that sees it as uncanny is part of a thread of reaction to cinema in general.44 But there are also specific effects in the film that amplify the movement's uncanniness. The microcinematographic section of Cheese Mites, like many popular science films, contains multiple interruptive splices, which add to the impression of hectic, erratic movement. A number of sudden and jerky reframings, resulting either from movement of the slide or the apparatus, also contribute to the sense of pro-filmic movement, adding to the impression of the mites "creeping and crawling about in all directions." These layers of manipulation contribute to the impression that the mites are somehow unnatural or uncanny.45 Indeed, their movement could even seem mechanical, an impression taken up by a fascinating parody of Cheese Mites, The Unclean World (Cecil Hepworth and Percy Stow, 1903).46 The Unclean World follows the multi-shot format of Cheese Mites: in the first shot a scientist-figure eats a meal, tries some cheese, and, after expressing his displeasure, plac- es a small bit of the cheese onto the stage of a microscope. The point of the joke emerges in the second shot, when hands appear within the "microscopic" image to reveal the microscopic creatures as mechanical wind-up toys. (Figure 3) The joke has a double edge. On the one hand it functions as an ostensible démystification. As the film's ironic subtide - "The Sururban-Bunkum Microbe-Guyoscope" - indicates, The Unclean World questioned the validity of what "The Unseen World" made vis- ible. When the hands intrude on the frame, the film is revealed as a fake scientific view. In this sense, The Unclean World invoked the nineteenth- century tradition of "visual scientific performances" that questioned or probed the reliability of science's revelation of new worlds. As Iwan Rhys Morus has argued, the history of "visual scientific performances" is an important resource for history of science because they "provide us with a way of probing the relationship between seeing and believing science too" (Morus 2006, 102). On the other hand, the joke is reflexive; the bugs' clockwork mecha- nism recalls the cinema's mechanical basis. In this sense, the clockwork toys serve as a reminder that microcinematography is itself a mechanical 44 For more on this reaction, see Gunning (2005). 45 The cheese mite has a longer history in the field of microscopy, having been used as a test object in the beginning of the nineteenth century. This earlier instance of interest in the cheese mite as seen through a microscope was also marked by a certain interest in its perceptual novelty. As Jutta Schickore recounts, "[t]he cheese mite could serve as a test because it offered surprising, unexpected views," that were capable of exciting "great curiosity" and the mite's delicate double teeth and jaws were described as "exquisite microscopic objects" (Schickore 2007, 117-118). 46 Le dejeuner du savant (Pathé 1905) also follows this template; see Godbey (2004).</page><page sequence="18">336 OLIVER GAYCKEN Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c - Video stills from The Unclean World (Percy Stow, 1903): courtesy of the British Film Institute. illusion. The discovery, made in the mode of fun, is of a machine that mim- ics life. The Unclean World thus points to a similarity between the trick film and the science film that involves their mode of revelation. "Just as in the scientific films, there presides in these films [trick films] the desire to show, in the spectacular mode, to be sure, that which the eye cannot see, to understand what escapes from knowledge" (Le Forestier 1999, 68). The popular science film and the trick film can be understood as ex- amples of what Tom Gunning, borrowing from the Russian Formalists,</page><page sequence="19">"LIVING PICTURE" 337 has called "cine-genres." Gunning writes of wanting "to offer a theory of cine-genres which is less rooted in narrative and editing and more related to those elements which Piotrovskij probably intended by the term 'photogeny.' [... A] new experience phenomenologically [... that has] litde to do with the actual content of the films, but rather relate [s] primarily to the cinematic illusion itself" (Gunning 1995, 58). So while "nature's closest secrets" designate amazing views of unfamiliar phenom- ena such as cheese mites, in another sense, "nature's closest secrets" are also the unique representational possibilities that "The Unseen World" presented. For Duncan, in other words, the sources of nature's closest secrets are both the hybrid nature of the microscope slide as well as the uncanny magic of cinematographic representation. The cinema's vivification of microscope slide culture included not only the slide's combination of the natural and the technological but also opened a new view. As Hannah Landecker has noted, the combina- tion of the cinema and the microscope at the beginning of the twentieth century created a new form of knowledge, "a technical portal to another world, a door that determines the experience of the world that lies on the other side of it" (Landecker 2011, 381). As with the introduction of electron microscopy in the middle of the twentieth century, technologi- cal innovations both borrow and modify existing optical cultures, dem- onstrating the fluctuating boundaries of the unseen world.47 47 For more on the changes that electron microscopy introduced into slide culture, see Gaudillière (2013).
