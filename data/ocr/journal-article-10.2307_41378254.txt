The Victorian period saw what were surely some of the most virtuosic achieve- ments in the history of watercolour painting, and technical experimentation which pushed the medium to its limits was one of the most striking ways in which feeling and science were combined. It was, of course, Constable who had begun the battle for recognition of landscape by the Royal Academy, and as the excellent catalogue reveals, the Victorian watercolourists played a crucial role in winning it. In contrast to the recent Royal Academy exhibition, reviewed in the April 1993 issue of this Journal , the Birmingham show of some 122 items had a narrower objective with emphasis on Ruskin's role as critic and mentor. The subjects were nearly all rural, with none of the ambitious figurative views, for example, favoured by Queen Victoria in her Deeside commissions. Patrons, who were often wealthy industrialists, liked pictures of nature untouched by modern man such as Burnham Beeches , a subject treated by both Myles Birkett Foster and Charles Davidson. There were also the more atmospheric views of the Turner and Cox tradition. Some unexpected practitioners included Sir Edward Poynter, PRA, better known for his Neoclassical allegories, who was represented by an eerie storm in the Pyrenees and a dream-like vision of Isola San Giulio , Lago d'Orta (1898). What captured the attention throughout, however, was the sheer diversity and mastery of means, which again gave the lie to the facile view that watercolour died with Turner and that the photograph killed invention. Ruskin's 'innocent eye' was, of course, an impossible ideal. Joseph Noel Paton's Study from Nature , Inveruglas (1861), was a minute analysis of stratified rocks which must have amply gratified Ruskin's obsession with geology; yet Paton's even focus turned both boulders and branches into grotesque, even anthropomorphic configurations. It was easy to see why Paton populated his oil landscapes with fairies and wood sprites. Almost hidden on a mossy bank, however, was a pair of binoculars and a shiny red pencil: emblems of science in the service of art. The picture was one of many to 474 RSA JOURNAL, JUNE 1993</page><page sequence="2">SPECTRUM Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery ' February in the Isle of Wight ' (1866) by John Brett show links with Pre-Raphaelitism, but the pristine brilliance of colour we also associate with the movement was already present as early as 1835 in William Turner of Oxford's waterlilies and blue reflections at Shipton on Cher well just as W. H. Hunt had anticipated the Pre-Raphaelite 'truth of foreground'. The purity of colour attainable on white paper indeed led to effects prophetic of Neo-Impressionism, like the glimpse of striated turquoise and pink sea in John Brett's almost surreally calm February in the Isle of Wight. It would be interesting to know how far colour choices were influenced by contemporary research into the permanence of the medium, a subject discussed in RSA Journals of the 1870s.3 With the increasing importance of both the 'Old' and 'New' Watercolour Societies, it was perhaps inevitable that the Ruskinian 'study' should evolve into the equivalent of the Constable 'six-footer'. George Edmund Warren's Rest in the Cool and Shady Wood (1861) was a huge exhibition piece, where the veils of luminous wash drawn by Turner across his late Swiss watercolours and the rough textures of David Cox's 'Scotch paper' technique were replaced with thou- sands of miniscule, stippled touches of opaque pigment, applied with gum to look almost like oil. By the 1870s and 18 80s the (seemingly) artless sketch was re-asserting itself. Whistler and the 'Glasgow Boys' Melville and Paterson achieved outstanding 'blottesque' effects, yet their pools of watery medium dropped onto wet paper revealed as much finesse of handling as any of the earlier techniques. A new expressive trend was evident in Albert Goodwin's Sunset in the Manufacturing Districts (1883) with its drops of red pigment literally bleeding in the sky above a derelict mill and smoking chimneys. Clausen's highly sophisticated manipulation of scratch marks, scraping, and rubbing down turned his Boy Trimming a Hedge (1890) as much into an essentially Ruskinian statement about the artist as workman as a nostalgic glorification of rural traditions. Perhaps the most extraordinary image of the whole exhibition, however, was by the artist who, as a pupil of William Blake, was nurtured not on science but on visions: Samuel Palmer. His Sunset (1861) was nothing less than a confrontation with the blazing sun itself, dropping from a sky of purple, pink and orange upon a landscape with a rustic millwheel, languid cattle and waving corn. Palmer's credo was succinct: 'Geological drawing is not art drawing . . . IMAGINATION ... is the hinge and essence of the whole matter'.4 DR CLARE WILLSDON Lecturer in History of Art, University of Glasgow NOTES i.
