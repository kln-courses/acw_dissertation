<plain_text><page sequence="1">Facts About the Human Body by Marianne and Mary-Alice Tully 64 pp. $4.47. 1977. Franklin Watts Inc., 730 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10019. The idea for this book is a clever one— unusual questions about the human body are asked, then answered in brief para graphs. Topics include: the mouth, skin, nerves, reproduction, respiration, circu lation, healing, the skeleton, digestion, and elimination. All of the questions—for example "Why does wax form in my ears?" or "What is a burp?"—-are high interest, and will surely motivate young readers. Certain aspects of the book, however, make me hesitate to recommend it for general use; for example, the use of im plied cause and effect (goose pimples prove we evolved from simpler animals); anthropomorphism (bacteria "especially like" beans); Lamarckism; and mislead ing information. Some information is incomplete—for example, the author states that some moles are harmless, but does not tell which ones, or why. There is a table of contents and a glos sary, but no index.
