<plain_text><page sequence="1">AKRO AND GAGANDEWA: A MELANESIAN MYTH Dorothy Ayers Counts University of Waterloo One of the most important tasks of an anthropologist is that of translator, to devise a set of analogies that translates the ideas, values and knowledge of the people he studies into terms that are intelligible to those who share his culture (Wagner 1974:9). Before he can achieve this task, the anthropologist must come to an understanding of the people's cultural categories and he should be aware of the points in their ideology and society where there exist paradoxes, tensions and dilemmas that defy resolution. One way to approach these categories and paradoxes is through the study of a people's oral literature. As Dundes notes, this literature may well "provide an invaluable means of seeing a culture from the inside out instead of from the outside in" (Dundes 1975:15). I wish here to attempt such a translation, to explore the complexities and sophistication of the thought of one group of Melanesian people, the Kaliai of north-west New Britain, through a study of one of their myths, the story of Akro and Gagandewa. The Kaliai are an Austronesian-speaking people numbering about 1000, who live in five coastal villages in the Kaliai census subdivision, north-west New Britain, Papua New Guinea. In spite of some 70 years of contact with Europeans and Australians, and that in the 1970s they send their children to school, belong to mission churches, and cash crop copra and cocoa, much of their way of life is still as described in Akro and Gagandewa. The people are subsistence horticulturists whose lives include the continuation of ritual cycles and ceremonial exchanges, maintenance of a corpus of oral literature, and belief in non-human beings with whom they share their world. The Kaliai have a rich heritage of oral literature and, although some tales are told solely to amuse, many others, such as Akro and Gagandewa are considered to contain historical, cultural, or sociological truth. The people self-consciously tell these stories to introduce their children to the social and physical environment in which they live. Even those stories which refer to fabulous beings or events may reflect and reconstruct reality and, when studied in their cultural context, give 33</page><page sequence="2">34 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS insight into that reality. These stories may be "real" in the sense that they give us, as outsiders, some possibility of gaining insight into native cognitive categories. For example, we learn in Akro and Gagandewa that anthropomorphic beings may be categorised either as an tu 'spirit beings' or as yavava 'human beings' or 'those who frighten parrots'. Further more, we learn of a third category of beings that appear to be birds but which in reality may be changelings who carry messages of death between the worlds of spirits and humans. Once we are aware of these categories, we may attempt to understand the nature of the relationship between the beings that occupy them. The relationships that are explored in myth are often those which are sources of tension and conflict between members of society. North American and European fairy tales, for instance, often focus on the rela tionship between stepmother and stepchild; Melanesian stories are fre quently concerned with the interaction between affines and between older and younger brothers. Tensions are likely to arise at these same points in human society. Myths, then, may identify the areas where there are contradictions that are not easily reconciled and where social balance is not easily maintained; they are preoccupied with those spots of strain where the web of the social fabric is weakest and where society is most vulnerable. These points may be particularly fragile because society places irreconcilable demands upon its members and the resolutions that myths seem to propose, the guidelines for behaviour that they seem to offer, may not in fact reflect the solutions or models of behaviour that society attempts to instil in its members. Instead myths may explore possible alternative ways of dealing with social paradox and ultimately demonstrate the essential Tightness of society's solutions to basically insoluble dilemmas by illustrating the disastrous results of other approaches (L?vi-Strauss 1967:24). It seems clear, then, that the careful study of a people's oral literature may enable us to gain insight into their conceptual categories and the internal paradoxes of their society and thought. It is my goal here to use the myth of Akro and Gagandewa to construct these insights into Kaliai culture. In order to accomplish this I present my analysis in three parts. First is a condensed text of the myth. Second is an exploration of some of the aspects of Kaliai philosophy that are expressed in the story. Finally I seek to discover some of the rules of proper behaviour that are revealed, sometimes by negative example, as the story unfolds. The story of Akro and Gagandewa that I present here is condensed from a longer version told to me by Jakob Mua Laopu, of Kandoka vil lage in Kaliai. Mua, who was born in the late 1920s and is now a man of middle age, has achieved self-taught literacy in both his native Lusi and</page><page sequence="3">A MELANESIAN MYTH 35 in Melanesian Pidgin, although he received only a few months of school ing before the Second World War. He is the eldest of four brothers, the son of a big-man and one of a line of big-men, and the elder of his men's house. As one of the leaders of his village, his particular strength is as a repository of traditional knowledge. He is generally recognised as one of the most knowledgeable and skilled story-tellers of the area, and his stan dards of excellence are very high indeed. Before he would allow me to record one of his performances he insisted that he be satisfied that the story was complete, internally consistent and culturally accurate. He was particularly critical of others who attempted to fit together incomplete bits and pieces of several unrelated stories with perhaps the addition of an element or two of their own invention. The results of this practice, according to Mua, are too often a conglomerate of several themes that bear no relationship to one another and a welter of unnecessary characters which ultimately confuses and bores the audience. My interpretation has developed over a period of 10 years of field research, from 1966 when I first heard the story to 1976, as my familiar ity with the Kaliai and their ways has grown. I was assisted in my understanding of the myth when David Counts and I made a film script from it and in 1975-1976 enlisted the aid of a number of Kandokans in attempting to make a film based on the story. Mua was our primary con sultant, but a number of other villagers talked with us at length about the myth and the way they thought it should be presented, and about the implications for modern Kaliai life that they considered the story to have. In order to communicate their ideas to us they recounted other stories and related events, showed us the descendants of the croton named Pulduvu that was planted by Gagandewa's father, and took us to sites mentioned in this and other important myths. So, although the meanings that I attribute to Akro and Gagandewa are ultimately limited by my cultural biases and by my incomplete understanding of another system of knowledge and belief, my effort is based on my informants' patient attempts to help me to see as they do. Therefore, I feel that the ideas that I present here reflect as accurate a "translation" of Kaliai culture as I, and perhaps as any North American, can make. The tale of Akro and Gagandewa is, in Kaliai terminology, a pelunga, a story from the 'time before'. As improbable as happenings in the story may seem to non-New Guineans, the Kaliai seem to consider the myth to be a reasonably accurate account of events that took place in the remote past. My informants referred to it in explanation of their reluctance to climb to the peak of Mount Andewa, and claimed that people who ven ture on the upper slopes of the mountain can hear village sounds and smell the smoke of cooking fires, even though nothing but forest can be seen.</page><page sequence="4">36 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS Some time after the events concluding this myth, when all direct inter course between humans and the spirits of Andewa had ended, the Ande wans are said to have relented and allowed men to obtain fathoms of the shell money of Andewa from time to time. A man needing some of it could obtain it by leaving a Siassi bowl at the entrance to a small cave near the foot of the mountain. Before leaving the bowl, however, he was supposed to cleanse himself by bathing thoroughly and by abstaining from sexual intercourse, for the odours of sexual congress and the unwashed human body were offensive to the spirits. This requirement was violated by a man who was in a hurry to acquire some shell money. As a result the shell strands are no longer available to human beings. A small bit of the Andewan shell money was for many years in the posses sion of a man from Kandoka village who treasured it as an heirloom. In 1975, followers of the cargo movement called The Story (Counts 1972, 1977) attempted to correct the wrong committed by their ancestors, the men of Gering, as related in the myth, by displaying 20 fathoms of Kaliai shell money and a pig on Mount Andewa where the spirits might see it. The Story followers hoped that the Andewans would accept the offering as compensation for the human error and make their money available to men once more. THE MYTH OF AKRO AND GAGANDEWA There was once a man called Akro who lived in the village of Gering. His father had provided him with no wife and so, in middle age, Akro anointed himself with love magic in an effort to attract a woman who would marry him. One day Akro and the other men of Gering went to the foot of Mount Andewa to cut tamaiao 'derris vines' for fish poison. Although the other men had partners, Akro went into the forest alone and found some of the vine near a spring which, unknown to him, served as the water supply for several villages of spirit people. On that same morning the people of the spirit village of Andewa went to work in the gardens leaving only Gagandewa, the daughter of the big man of Andewa, alone there. She was menstruating for the first time, and was hidden in her seclusion house called a kailanga waiting for her father to present her as a marriageable woman to the community. At noon Gagandewa went to the spring to get water. Hearing the sounds of Akro's axe, she crept near to discover who it could be. She was overcome by the power of Akro's love magic and desired him for her lover. First, Gagandewa caused the valley to be shrouded in a dense fog. Then she stepped out to confront Akro. After a brief conversation, they made love. When they were finished, Gagandewa asked Akro if he were human, and Akro, becoming frightened, tried to flee. However, Gagan</page><page sequence="5">A MELANESIAN MYTH 37 dewa clouded his mind as she had clouded the valley, and he became con fused and was unable to escape. Finally he agreed to return to Andewa as Gagandewa's husband, and she transported them to the mountain top. Akro was astounded to see that Andewa was like a great city. As far as he could see, houses and men's houses were lined neatly on flat open ground. Strain as he would he could see no end to the village, no bush or wild forest. Gagandewa explained, "This is my home. From the coast down there where you live you can see this place only as rough and jagged peaks, here and there overgrown with vines and dense bush. If you had come up you would have seen that it is a village. There is no underbrush, no mountain, no rough or steep places here." At first Akro stared in amazement at the empty village. Then he real ised that the frames of some unfinished houses were lashed together, not with vines, but with strands of shell money (vula). The strings of money were treated like vines. Where a string was too long for the job, the end had been cut and thrown to the ground as so much trash to be swept away. Akro began to collect the vula, explaining to Gagandewa, "This is money. We use it to make gifts to our brides' families. We buy pigs and dogs and use it to give ceremonies to honour our dead. It's not something to build houses with. It's valuable. It's vula." Gagandewa replied, " Vula isn't like that. Wait here a moment and I'll go to my father's house and bring some real vula so you can see the dif ference." Soon she returned with a basket containing two strands of shell beads, small and white and so finely polished they could not have been made by human hands. "You look. You think that is vula. That's of no consequence. It's nothing. This is real vula. That other stuff is only fit for lashing houses." When the afternoon was nearly gone, Gagandewa and Akro went inside her 'seclusion house' so that they could not be seen by the return ing villagers. As the first people began to arrive, Gagandewa heard Akro's companions calling him from far down the mountain. She was worried lest the Andewa people became curious about the lost man, so she asked her younger sister, Vilngo, to go and tell the calling men that they should give up their search for Akro as he was living with the spirits. Vilngo changed herself into a bird and flew to where Akro's companions were calling. There she perched on the branch of a tree and spoke to them in bird speech. The men did not understand, and finally she became disgusted and flew back to the village where she changed into a woman. The men continued to call Akro, so Gagandewa again sent Vilngo to talk to them, this time in human speech. "Don't search for Akro any longer," she told them. "He lives now in the great village on Andewa. Go back to your homes. Akro is dead."</page><page sequence="6">38 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS After a while Gagandewa became pregnant. Once her mother did get a long glimpse of Gagandewa and was shocked by the change. "Gagan dewa, the look that you have is not that of a virgin but that of a married woman. Your eyes have lost their lustre. Your skin is no longer bright and smooth with oils as it was. You have the dull eye and the long neck and the dry, dirty, skin of a married woman." Gagandewa responded, "Perhaps I am becoming ill." At first Akro was satisfied to stay with Gagandewa in the 'seclusion house', but as time passed he became restless. He looked through the cracks in the wall and, seeing the nubile young women of the village,he longed to be free. Gagandewa noticed Akro's interest in the young girls, and this angered her. "I don't want you to talk to those girls. I don't like it. I'm your wife and you must think only of me. What have they got that I lack? We're all women. My desire for you is as strong as when we met. Don't think that I will share you with other women. If they want husbands they will have to find their own." Her warning was sufficient and Akro controlled his feelings. Finally Gagandewa's pregnancy became obvious. Late one night she stole across the village to her parents' house and explained her situation to them. She ended with this request: "I would like for you to call for the end of my confinement, and when all of my kinsmen have gathered for the feast I will come out and bring my man with me. If you approve of him, he will be my husband. But if you and my kinsmen think him unsuitable for me, you can kill and eat him." Gagandewa's father assured her that no one would harm Akro. The following day the people prepared for the ceremony. All night they sang and danced. In the morning Gagandewa was dressed in great finery, while Akro came forth dressed simply and carrying a war club called a vao which he had carved and painted during the months he had been hid den. After they were seated together before the assembled villagers, Gagandewa's father presented Akro as her husband, and they were honoured. The effects of Akro's love magic still lingered and several young women quietly asked Gagandewa to accept them as second wife to Akro, but in each case she refused and advised each woman to find her own husband. Even though Akro and Gagandewa could now live openly in the village, it was still necessary for Gagandewa to restrict his movements. He might never go out of the centre of the village, for the spirits of suicides lived near the edges of the place, and they would have destroyed Akro. Therefore, they seldom left the village, even to go to the gardens. Instead, their food was provided by her kinsmen.</page><page sequence="7">A MELANESIAN MYTH 39 One day, when their son was a small child, he glanced up and saw some orange coconuts that had been planted by his grandfather, and he cried for them. Gagandewa sent Akro to climb the tree and throw down some of the nuts. "My father planted those trees when I was born," she told him. "They are as a picture of me. My body is like the coconuts. My father even called these trees for me. So climb up and throw down some of the nuts for the child to play with. These coconuts are my body." Akro climbed the tree and, as he was reaching for the nuts, he saw far below on the coast his home village and the smoke rising from his mother's house. He imagined her there, alone and old, and he began to weep. A tear fell on Gagandewa's breast, and she questioned Akro about it. At first he dissembled, but finally he admitted the cause of his grief. Gagandewa responded, "When my father returns from his garden I will speak to him. You know the customs of marriage. You are my master. I must follow your will. I am only a woman and cannot force you to do my will. Come down, and when my father comes we'll talk to him." When they were told of Akro's grief for his mother, Gagandewa's father and kinsmen agreed that Akro had the right to take his wife and child to his home. "How can we stop them? Is the woman a child that we should hold her back? She is a married woman, responsible to her hus band. They may go." The following morning Gagandewa's kinsmen gathered together much food and gifts of vula. Before they left, Gagandewa^s father called her aside and, after instructing her to behave properly, assured her that she could return home if she were mistreated. Then they departed for Gering. When they arrived, a crowd gathered to marvel at Akro's return and at Gagandewa's great beauty and light, shining skin. The gifts prepared by her kinsmen appeared on the verandah of Akro's mother's house, and these were distributed by Gagandewa to the people of Gering. "This vula is a gift," she explained, "for accepting my child into your village. I am the daughter of the big-man of Andewa. Although we have dwelt apart and my people have been invisible to you, things will now be different between us. My marriage to Akro will make it possible for you and the people of Andewa to be friends. Things that you need can be sought from my people and they can come and ask your help. Whereas before we were strangers, my marriage will now unite us as allies." At the same time Akro warned his fellows that they must treat Gagandewa with honour, and that they must never speak evil of her or call her an antu 'spirit woman', for "she is just like we are." And everyone understood. One day the people of Gering went to clear land for new gardens. Gagandewa went with the other women to gather food to prepare for the</page><page sequence="8">40 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS men, leaving her son in the care of Akro's mother. In the afternoon, when his mother was late in returning to the village, the boy became mischievous and fought with the other children. When his grandmother tried to stop him he speared an areca palm tree that had been planted by Akro's father, killing it. She dragged him into the house where he threw ashes on his father's pillow and broke up the saplings from Akro's bed. Finally, the old woman lost her temper and attacked the boy with evil words: "Why are you destroying my son's bed? You don't act like a human being. But then you're not a human child are you? Your mother isn't human. My son married that antu woman and she bore you. She's an antu and you are too." At these words the child became hysterical, and nothing his grand mother could do quieted him. He cried and rolled on the ground until he became scratched and filthy. When Gagandewa returned she saw her son lying in the dirt. First she placed the taro on the fire to cook. Then she returned to the child and asked him what had happened. Sobbing, the boy told her what his grandmother had said and asked if it were true. Sadly, Gagandewa told her son the story of his birth and ended by say ing, "I thought that if these humans accepted us we should stay and all would be happy and well. But now we shall have to go away, and our going will be these people's loss." When the child quieted, Gagandewa prepared the food. When the taro was baked, she took the share for the workers and put it in a basket, but she set aside two taro for Akro. These she placed in a hanging basket called a paro. Into the basket with the food she placed a frond from her fibre skirt. Then she and the child went to the village spring. When they reached the spring, Gagandewa filled the coconut shell con tainers with water, prepared food for the pigs, and then wrapped tobacco leaves for a cigar. Breaking the cigar into two parts, she smoked half and left half on a boulder for Akro. Then she and the child were transported to Andewa. When Akro returned from the gardens he found the taro and the frond of skirt in the paro, and he realised that something was wrong. He followed her to the spring where he found the things that Gagandewa had carefully prepared: the containers of water, the food ready for the pigs, the half cigar on the boulder. Returning to the village, he asked his mother if she had offended Gagandewa, but his mother denied everything. Grieving, Akro con tinued to search, returning to the spring where he had first met Gagandewa. There he searched and called for two days until, finally, the voice of Gagandewa answered, telling him what had happened. Akro then returned to his village where he speared his mother, killing her.</page><page sequence="9">A MELANESIAN MYTH 41 Then he returned to his house to sleep, and there he remained. After a time, the big-man of Andewa, to avenge the insult to his daughter, declared war on the men of Gering. Half the humans had died when the spirit of a Gering man who had been killed in the fighting appeared as an antu in the spirit village of Ngambri. He aroused the spirits and brought them to fight on the side of the humans. Thus, the antu of Andewa were forced to retreat. Peace and stillness settled, and the big-man of Andewa asked for a meeting with the men of Gering. When all had assembled he addressed them saying: "Today I shall plant this tanket, this croton called Pulduvu, as a symbol of the promise I now give you. In the past we have visited one another, but now I plant Pulduvu to divide us. In the future you will look at our mountain places and you will see only ridges and jungle, but it will not be so. We will see things as they really are, but your minds will be clouded as they were before Akro came. Pulduvu divides us and we shall have peace." Then he planted Pulduvu near the Alulu River and on Mount Andewa. With the planting all intercourse between humans and spirits ended. Though they are there we cannot see them. Even today they are hidden from us. KALIAI PHILOSOPHY Myths serve to provide an apparent resolution or 'mediation' of problems which are by their very nature incapable of any final resolution (Leach 1966:80). Akro and Gagandewa is a complex myth which contains a large number of oppositions and intricate relationships. I wish to explore briefly some of the relationships that exist between the following six pairs: nature culture death life non-human human others own kin(d) affines kinsmen female male These oppositions are not tidy nor do they constitute a nicely bounded, equated set. Nevertheless, the myth seems to draw parallels between the opposed categories and to ask a series of related questions about the boundaries that separate them and the relations that exist between them. What, it asks, are the boundaries between life and death? Between nature and culture? What defines the difference between human and non human? Between us and them? What happens if these boundaries are transgressed? What kind of relations can a person have with those</page><page sequence="10">42 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS "others" whose boundaries must be violated in order that the social transactions of political alliance, economic exchange, and marriage can be made? In order to make sense of the messages contained in the myth, it is necessary to understand some of the categories of Kaliai thought and to draw out some of the parallels that are made between them. For exam ple, the non-human sphere is divided into at least three categories: ghosts, other spirits, and animals. These are not thought to be mutually exclusive, and transformation may occur between them with no apparent difficulty, as, for example, the transformation of the spirit girl Vilngo into a bird. Kaliai mythology is replete with creatures who are spirit beast changelings, beings who are believed to live in the forest and who may have intercourse with men. For example, a Kaliai cargo movement was founded in 1969 by a man who claimed to have been given the secrets of cargo by a spirit being who appeared to him alternatively in snake and human form (Counts 1972). The boundaries between human and non-human, between nature and culture, may also be crossed; however, not with impunity. There are rules for these crossings, rules that either deflect the dangerous effects or encourage the desirable ones of category mixing. There are also rules for crossing the boundary between one's own kin(d) and others and bringing another into the kin circle as spouse and parent of the group's children. The myth draws parallels between the two kinds of boundary crossing, reaffirms the rationale of the rules, and demonstrates some of the pos sible results of their transgression. There is a progressive development of equivalence of opposition that is specifically stated. Humans are arrayed against spirits who are the "others" with whom goods are exchanged, affinal relations are estab lished, and against whom warfare is conducted. The social relationships between men and spirits move through a complete closed cycle. The initial condition in which no relationship is present is altered by a secret sexual association between two individuals which eventually receives social recognition as a marriage. This marriage leads men and spirits to become allied as affines and exchange partners. This tie is severed when the person who links the two communities together is rejected and, as the relationship between the two groups becomes progressively more distant, men and spirits become enemies. Finally, the spirits are once again dis tant strangers with whom no intercourse is possible. The myth seems to express the following equation: non-humans are equivalent to others and to affines, while humans are equivalent to my kin(d) and to kinsmen. Or, in shorter form, non-human = others = affines, while human = my kin(d) = kinsmen. Therefore, as the myth warns of the dangers and</page><page sequence="11">A MELANESIAN MYTH 43 explores the benefits for humans of developing social relationships with spirits, it is by analogy also exploring the benefits and dangers of form ing alliances of trade and marriage with others; in other words, it inquires into the mixed blessings of exogamy. The theme of affinal danger is a common one in Kaliai mythology. A person's affines are, according to north-west New Britain mythology, liable to shame him into suicide; they may cause his death, or they may even cause him to be cannibalised by his own kinsmen. The conclusion to be drawn from myth is that a person's affines are a potential source of great danger to him. At best, they remind a man of his debt to them for providing him with a wife and sons to carry on his line, and their very existence reminds him of his shame if his debts and obligations to them are not met. At worst, they are capable of deliberately acting to destroy the kin ties on which Kaliai society rests?the ties between father and son and between brothers. Thus, the Kaliai are faced with the paradox that the group which provides the women who are essential to the creation of the next generation, and therefore to the survival of a kin group, may also threaten to destroy that group. Part of the message of Akro and Gagandewa is communicated through an exploration of the uncertainty of the boundaries that are seen to exist between nature and culture and between reality and illusion. The myth warns that the distinction between nature and culture may not be as it is perceived by men, and thus men may confuse the two. Further, the myth suggests that a person's perception of reality depends on his per spective. For example, vula which is essential in establishing and main taining social relationships between men and which is, therefore, the quintessence of Kaliai culture, is treated by the spirit people as being of only marginal cultural interest, as vines for house lashing. To the antu, human vula was of no consequence. In Gagandewa's words, "it is nothing." So, those things that are valued by one's own group as being part of the very foundation of society may, when viewed by others, be only cultural trash. The reverse is also true. Things that are important elements of the culture of the antu of Andewa are viewed by men as being in a state of nature. Men saw the top of Andewa as being only wild bush where no men lived, as being natural. In fact, it was the location for a village that was so large that it was like a great city, so large that the forest (nature) could not be seen from its streets. Even language, the basic means of human communication and thus for the transmission of culture, seems to the non-speaker to be only noise and thus devoid of cultural meaning. The important message that Vilngo had for Akro's companions was not understood at first because her speech was unintelligible to them. They</page><page sequence="12">44 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS did not recognise it as language but only as bird sound. There are at least four messages that are communicated by the myth's exploration of the illusory and relative quality of human categories. The first message is that there is no clear and absolute boundary between culture and nature. People may be misled by appearances and assume that, because something seems to be natural, it really is. This belief permeates Kaliai philosophy, and people are concerned to teach their children the clues that will help them to identify those things that are seemingly natural but which, in fact, have cultural meaning. Children are taught, for example, that birds which cry at night may not be just birds. They may really be spirit messengers who warn men of an impending death, as Vilngo told Akro's companions of his "death". Akro and Gagandewa has as one of its purposes to teach how it is that some things in the Kaliai experience are not, in spite of outward appear ance, simply a part of nature. The picture of Andewa presented in the myth, for example, is believed to be true. As I mentioned at the begin ning of this article, Kaliai believe that Andewa is the location of a large village of spirit people. People who approach the top of the mountain may smell wood smoke and hear children crying and dogs barking, even though nothing can be seen. This experience is unnerving and people avoid the place. The second message of Akro and Gagandewa is that the human view of reality may not be the "true" view. Men may fail to see correctly. They may, for example, mistake a spirit creature for an ordinary snake and be destroyed by it, as is the case in another Kaliai myth. In each case in Akro and Gagandewa, when the human view of reality differs from the view held by the spirits, the humans are wrong. Vilngo is not just a bird; Andewa is not really a mountain peak covered with jungle; vula is not as valuable as humans believe it to be. The cost of faulty perception in distinguishing between reality and illusion may be great?the loss of wealth or even death. This idea, that the failure to see things as they really are and act appro priately may result in poverty or death, is a theme in Kaliai cargo belief, as is the underrating of the value of native culture. One Kaliai cargo myth, for example, credits native people with failing to distinguish between things of little value and things of true value when they were offered their choice in the mythic past. Instead of selecting the machines, guns, rice, and cloth that were then given to the whites, the native people chose items of native culture, things that have proved to be of little con sequence?trash. Another Kaliai myth explains that native people pos sess inferior goods because the cargo dispensing culture hero was offended by New Britain men who failed to recognise him and so treated</page><page sequence="13">A MELANESIAN MYTH 45 him as if he were an ordinary snake. The cargo hero then went to America where he was welcomed and treated as though he were a brother. As a result he gave the valuable things to the whites and the left overs to the people of New Britain. Another aspect of the investigation of the implications of the reality illusion dichotomy by Akro and Gagandewa is the exploration of one of the paradoxes of language, the implications of naming. In fact, naming something does not change its reality: "a rose by any other name. ..." Thus, although Akro is insistent that Gagandewa not be called an antu, that she must be defined as human and given the social attributes of human, not spirit, calling her human does not change reality. She is antu, not human, and when finally she is given her proper title her behaviour changes accordingly. Once she is called antu she cannot continue to live as a human being interacting in human society, but she must return to the spirit world where she behaves as an antu. The masquerade can continue as long as the truth is not spoken but, to return to the paradox, to name something is to define it, to give it a specific reality that may, or may not, accord with that "true" reality which men may misunderstand. There are at least two implications of this paradox which are explored in Akro and Gagandewa and in other Kaliai myths. The first concerns the relationship that exists between a thing and its name; the second deals with the peculiar danger that may inhere in speaking the truth when it is discovered that something is not as it seems: the danger in calling something by its true name. It seems that, in Kaliai, to name something is to call on its inherent essence or power. This establishes a potentially dangerous connection between the speaker and the thing named. Its power is aroused and the speaker is rendered vulnerable to that power. There are numerous hints of this in Kaliai behaviour and in Kaliai mythology. For example, the names of affines are tabooed. An affine may never be addressed or referred to by name but only by status (Tambu bilong mi 'my affine'), or indirectly, as by teknonymy (Sigi's mother). Gagandewa is in a unique situation. She can be referred to by name (although presumably not by Akro's mother, as this would violate Kaliai norms), but her true status as a spirit woman may not be referred to. This prohibition is violated, not by just anyone in the human community, but by her mother-in-law. This gross violation of custom results not only in Gagandewa's loss to the community through her symbolic suicide, it also results in the violent death of the old woman who is slain by her own son, and in the death during warfare of half the men of Gering. Another example of a Kaliai custom which may assist in explaining the myth is one of the rituals, called matapapau, which is performed for a</page><page sequence="14">46 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS first-born child. The child is introduced by name to each of the signifi cant places?reefs, rivers, bays, points, beaches, mountains, islands? along the north-west New Britain coast. His name is called at each spot and he is taught the name of each place together with any story or taboo associated with it. During this same journey, the child is also introduced to each of his father's trading partners. The Kaliai explained the ration ale for the trip, saying that its purpose was long ol i savi long naim bilongen 'all would know his name'. The importance of knowing, but of not referring to, a thing's true name is emphasised in one of the myths told during the matapapau. This myth warns people of the danger in names by contrasting the behaviour of the two men. One, who is told by spirits that a crocodile is a canoe, accepts their evaluation of the thing and behaves towards it as though it were a canoe. Later, when he catches fish, he refuses to call their names but instead describes them: red fish, fish with hands, etc. This man is rewarded by the spirits and sent home with enough fish to feed his entire village. The other man, who meets the same spirits, denies that the crocodile can possibly be a canoe, insists on called it a crocodile, and is terrified of it. This angers the spirits who kill and eat the man after he unwittingly calls their names, thinking that he is only calling the names of the fish he has caught. In yet another myth, a culture hero changes a woman to a tree and back to a woman by calling her "tree" and "woman". She is forced to take the shape of the thing she is named to be; she is changed by the power of the word. These myths provide insight into the Kaliai notion of the relationship that exists between language and reality. To name something is to recognise its character, and the act of naming seems to establish a rela tionship between the quality of the thing named and the person who has recognised it. However, there are some things in the universe that are bet ter left alone. A person must know their names so that he will not call them in ignorance. Other things are benevolent, or at least harmless, and a person must know their names so that he can call them if he wishes to establish a relationship with them. The problem is that a person may be tempted to allow a thing to be defined by its dangerous attributes and call it by that name rather than by a name that brings out the positive qualities of the thing and impels it to be helpful to man. It is this problem that the matapapau seeks to resolve by teaching children the correct names of things, and it is the consideration of this problem that leads to understanding the third message of Akro and Gagandewa. A person must be aware of a thing's correct name, but he should only call it by a name which activates its positive qualities. If someone else calls a thing by a name that invites a positive relationship with it within</page><page sequence="15">A MELANESIAN MYTH 47 the definition of the term (if, for instance, a crocodile is called "canoe" or an antu is called "human"), then that name should not be challenged even if the obvious attributes of the thing seem to contradict the category implied in the term. The paradox of the name can be used to man's advantage, for even if the name given does not square with observable reality, as long as the name is applied the thing is constrained by it and must act accordingly. The Kaliai use of language and of naming also gives us insight into their system of categorisation. We can assume that two (to us) dissimilar things that are treated alike linguistically must share some quality that merits them similar treatment. Bulmer (1967) has pointed out that the Karam of Highland New Guinea treat cassowaries and certain kinds of people?affines and cross-cousins?in the same way. The Karam use a language of avoidance in referring to both, while no special language is required for other humans and animals. The linguistic classification of cassowaries together with these kin categories is consistent with other aspects of Karam behaviour towards them and with mythology which establishes that cassowaries are cross-cousins to men. Similarly, the Kaliai locate affines and spirits together and treat them in similar ways. Both are potentially dangerous and are to be avoided. Neither a daughter-in-law nor a fish caught at Alulu, the place of spirits, should be spoken to directly or called by name. A wise person uses circumlocution and the language of avoidance in dealing with both. Thus the link between spirits and affines and the theme of affinal danger is linguis tically reaffirmed. The fourth message of Akro and Gagandewa arises from a considera tion that other human beings, foreigners, who seem to be like oneself, may, in fact, be so different as to defy understanding. Their culture and their language may be so alien that it is impossible to communicate with them. Those who appear to be human may be, for all purposes, non human. This gives rise to a potentially dangerous situation for, in order to survive, people must establish social relations of trade, of marriage, of political alliance with others. Akro and Gagandewa warns that fatal misunderstanding may arise between people who are linked in alliance. Speaking in the idiom of human opposed to spirit, the myth specifically cautions that these differences may be so great as to lead to entirely dif ferent interpretations of reality. People may even differ in their percep tion of reality, in their most basic notions of the content and meaning of culture. In the myth, those things that are treated by men as being cultural items may be treated by spirits as being part of the natural world. Conversely, what spirits hold to be cultural, men may see as being natural.</page><page sequence="16">48 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS I have already suggested that, in the language of the myth, humans are equivalent to my kin(d) and to kinsmen while non-humans are equivalent to others and to affines. If this set of analogies is accepted, then the set of inversions between reality and illusion, nature and culture, and spirits and men may be seen as a restatement of one of the major themes of the myth; our relationships with those others with whom we trade and marry are fraught with danger because others are different and, being different, they are likely to hold different views about the most basic things. They may, as Jacob Mua Laopu suggests is the case with the antu in this story, believe that they are, in fact, true human beings while mortals (yavava) are only "those who frighten parrots"?beings who are so alien and clumsy that their walking through the forest frightens the raucous birds. The result of the difference of opinion about the nature of reality means that tragic misunderstanding is a constant risk. The others may place a different interpretation on those activities that we believe to be critical to the maintenance of social ties. They may hold us and our values in contempt. To them our social values and valuables may be of no consequence. Or, we may misinterpret the clearest signals that they give about themselves and their culture. We may fail to understand the significance of those things that are important to them. We may look at their activities and fail to see what is relevant. We may look at their great village and see only bush; they may speak to us and we may fail to under stand because we hear only noise, only bird speech. Therefore, the myth suggests, culture is relative and is defined by the people who share it. When a person has intercourse with others with whom culture and kin ship are not shared, he must be aware of the potential for misunder standing. Otherwise, those others may offend or be offended, and the result may be warfare, death, or the severing of social relationships. The boundaries between life and death are not clearly demarcated in Kaliai thought (Counts 1977). The ambiguous area that lies between and mediates the two spheres is explored in the myth. It must be noted that the Kaliai rarely consider death to be the result of a natural process. Death in almost all cases does not "just happen". It is caused. A person may die at the hands of another person as the result of violence or sorcery; he may die as the result of the intervention of spirits; or he may commit suicide. The myth of Akro and Gagandewa deals with these three categories of dead: the recently killed, suicides, and those who are transported through the intervention of a spirit. The transition from life to death is not accomplished immediately as a result of the act of death, but is a process of gradual withdrawal from the interests, activities, and social relationships of life. Ideally the process of separation begins before death when a dying person asks to be placed</page><page sequence="17">A MELANESIAN MYTH 49 outside his house, under a tent or lean-to, where he is surrounded by his grieving friends and kinsmen. After death the body was traditionally buried under the floor of the men's house. Today it is buried in a cemetery, but a small house is built over the grave and the dead person's immediate kinsmen often build a temporary shelter nearby where they live for about a month while the spirit accustoms itself to its new condi tion. The spirit is believed to linger near the grave until its body decom poses, after which it is thought to take up residence in a spirit community similar to the village of Andewa. It is during this period shortly after death that the ghost retains some of its identification with its living friends and kinsmen and may mediate between them and those who are long dead. It is during this period, too, that the living may establish com munication with a ghost, or the spirit, if it is restless, may be seen by its living relatives. The ghost of a person whose death has not been avenged, for example, may appear to its cross cousin, an act which is interpreted as the spirit urging its living kinsmen to discover the identity of its killer and exact retribution for its death. The myth's portrayal of suicides as being dangerous to human beings is at least partially explained by the Kaliai belief in death as a process of withdrawal, and by the implications of suicide for Kaliai society (Counts 1980). A person who commits suicide is said to have been "killed with talk". A person usually commits suicide because he is caught in a situa tion of constant strife, frequently with his spouse or affines, or because he has been shamed. Someone who has been shamed by unjust accusa tions of wrong-doing or by gossip and slander, and who is not supported by his kinsmen, may commit suicide as an expression of his grief and anger at being ill-used by others who have failed to treat him as they should. An act of suicide is the ultimate statement of the breakdown of social relationships. It is to be expected, then, that the spirit of such a person will remain restless. It may never achieve a state of disinterest and neutrality towards the living and take its normal place in spirit society. Rather it exists on the fringes of the spirit community where it remains hostile, angry, and potentially dangerous to human beings. So Gagandewa warns Akro about the evil spirits of the suicides. The fact that a suicide is considered to be a victim of another's evil behaviour, and is one whose death should be avenged, explains why Gagandewa's return home provided cause for war. Her return to Andewa, the village of the dead, was an act of suicide. To make certain that Akro understood what she had done, she left unmistakable signs: a paw 'hanging basket' where she placed his taro; a portion of her skirt; and a broken cigar. A paro is a special basket, made by men, kept in the men's house, and used to offer food to the spirits. No woman will eat</page><page sequence="18">50 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS food that has been put in one. A person who wishes to indicate that he has been severely offended might give food to his offender in a paro, a sure sign that serious trouble is to follow. The portion of skirt, which my informants are certain was a pubic cover from the front of Gagandewa's dress, was explicitly placed to shame Akro. This portion of a woman's skirt covers her genitals and is a focus for the power and danger of the female element. No Kaliai man could ignore its symbolism. Traditionally a big-man who had lost control of his followers in a fight could regain the upper hand by waving a portion of the pubic cover of his wife (the "mother of the village") in their faces. Men thus exposed, even sym bolically, to their mother's genitals quickly fell into a shamed silence. I saw this technique used in 1967 to quiet a riot. Gagandewa's act in leav ing a portion of her skirt shamed Akro and warned him of the danger to which he was exposed. The broken cigar was a specific statement of suicidal intent. She could have left other signs: a broken bracelet, a hand or foot print in ashes, or some other personal item or marker that had been broken, defaced, or covered with ash. All of these are clearly understood as a marker of intent to commit suicide. The meaning of these three items is clear to a Kaliai. Gagandewa had been severely offended by Akro or one of his kin. In grief and anger she had committed suicide, shaming Akro and exposing him to the danger of her unrestrained femininity, the vengeance of her kin, Akro's non human affines. Gagandewa has been killed with talk and this act is so ter rible that nothing Akro can do, not even his act of matricide, appeases the angry spirits. The result can only be death and the end of social rela tionships. In contrast with the potentially dangerous relationship between suicides and men, the behaviour of the man from Gering who was killed in the war illustrates the ideal relationship between the living and the dead. This man not only retained his identity with and sympathy for his living comrades, he mobilised a village of spirits to fight on the side of the humans and against the other spirits. Thus the ghost of a person who died while co-operating with his fellow-men mediated in their favour and helped them to live, in contrast to the spirits of the suicides who brought destruction and death. The Kaliai also believe that a person may be transformed from the sphere of the living to the sphere of the dead, without the act of death, by the intervention of a spirit being. This is believed by the Kaliai to be a danger even today. Children, especially young children who do not par ticipate in society as full social beings (a transition that is marked by a child's ability to tell his parents of his dreams), are in particular danger of being kidnapped by spirits. In the myth the transformation from the</page><page sequence="19">A MELANESIAN MYTH 51 sphere of life to the sphere of death takes place in beings who are themselves in an ambiguous state or, in Turner's words, in a "state of liminality". According to Turner (1969:95): The attributes of liminality or of liminal personae ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous, since this condition and these persons elude or slip through the network of classifications that nor mally locate states and positions in cultural space. Liminal entities are neither here nor there; they are betwixt and between the positions assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention, and ceremonial. This is true of both Akro and Gagandewa. Akro is neither a young unmarried man nor an older married man and father. He is a misfit, without companions, a middle-aged bachelor in a society that has no place for bachelors. Gagandewa is also in a state of liminality, being isolated after the onset of her first menstruation and thus being neither child nor marriageable woman. It is these two ambiguous persons who meet through the mediation of love magic and are transformed. Akro is transformed to Andewa where his presence places him in the same cate gory as the dead: Vilngo tells Akro's friends, "Akro is dead". Gagandewa is also transformed to the village of Gering where she is placed in the category of living human being. Akro tells his fellow villagers, "I warn you, you must never call her an antu. She is just like we are and you must never call her a spirit." Thus human becomes spirit and spirit becomes human, and both Akro and Gagandewa are placed in an enigmatic position mediating between life and death. This mediating position is, however, intolerable. Akro can never become a full member of spirit society. He is hidden away for many months and may only appear when Gagandewa's pregnancy can no longer be concealed. Even then he is in danger of being rejected and devoured, and his continued existence in Andewa requires that others provide food for him. He cannot move about freely for there are the spirits of those who committed suicide who would destroy him. Akro's movement is restricted until he climbs the coconut palm and, seeing the smoke of his mother's fire, desires to return home. Gagandewa, the spirit woman, goes to Gering with her husband and, in doing so, is transformed into a human being. However, Gagandewa can no more be fully accepted in human society than Akro could fully and freely participate in the society of spirits. From the first her appear ance sets her apart; it is obvious that she is different. Finally, in spite of Akro's insistence that Gagandewa is human and must be treated as such, his own mother says the forbidden words: Gagandewa is not a human being; she is an antu. The transition cannot be made. Thus the spell is broken and Gagandewa returns to the home of the antu.</page><page sequence="20">52 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS There are two messages here. First the myth suggests that persons who are not firmly fixed in the social network are not fully protected by society and are thus especially vulnerable to nature. Only full participa tion in society can render a person completely human. Otherwise he is partially in a state of nature and is susceptible to those uncontrolled desires and needs which are denied social expression. It is, therefore, incumbent on society to make certain that its members are brought into full membership in the proper way and at the correct time. Uninitiated children and unmarried adults cannot take their place in society, and their liminal condition creates risks for them and, through them, for society as well. It is the responsibility of society to make certain that the rituals and ceremonies that bring a person into full social participation are properly performed because an individual cannot do these things for himself. Akro cannot, on his own initiative and without the participation of human society, achieve the status of husband and father. Biological fact and individual desire are not enough to create social relationships. Gagandewa and the child have not been brought into human society in the proper way?through the correct rituals and exchanges of marriage and initiation?and they cannot be accepted into human society. Thus the myth warns that society is responsible for the socialisation and incor poration of its members and neglects this duty at its own peril. Although Akro and Gagandewa are liminal beings, they represent opposed conditions which are in turn mediated. According to L?vi Strauss (1963:224): We need only assume that two opposite terms with no intermediary always tend to be replaced by two equivalent terms which admit a third one as a mediator; then one of the polar terms and the mediator become replaced by a new triad, and so on. . . . Thus we may have mediators of the first order, of the second order, and so on, where each term generates the next by a double process of opposition and correlation. The myth seems to follow this process as Akro and Gagandewa give birth to their mediator, the child, who is part human and part spirit and who is identified with both in the progression of the myth. Initially, the child is enclosed in Gagandewa's body and Akro is enclosed in Gagan dewa's menstrual hut; Akro emerges from the hut only when the child is almost ready to emerge from his mother's womb. The three of them live in Andewa until the child, by asking for a coconut which symbolises his mother's body, sets in motion the events which result in their leaving Andewa for Gering. There the child is sent to Akro's mother and iden tifies himself as her grandson, a human child. His identification with</page><page sequence="21">A MELANESIAN MYTH 53 Akro is unacceptable, however, and the child is rejected by his grand mother who irrevocably severs the link between the child and human beings and also the link of descent between father and son: "You say that you're a human being, but you're not. You're the child of that spirit woman. You're an antu." Thus, being dissociated from Akro and iden tified with Gagandewa, the child returns with her to Andewa. It is thus apparent that one of the conclusions of the myth is that the boundary between human and spirit, between life and death, cannot be successfully bridged. The child is merged with the spirits from whom he originated and the opposing spheres, represented by Akro and Gagan dewa, return to their original state of complete separation. The boundaries between life and death, between human and spirit, and their attempted mediation, are also communicated in Akro and Gagan dewa by the symbolic use of water and of plants. Each stage of transition from the human world to the spirit world in the myth is marked by the presence of water. Akro and Gagandewa meet by the spring; the tear that falls on Gagandewa's breast signals that it is time for their passage to the human sphere; Gagandewa and the child are transported back to Andewa from the spring where the villagers go to draw water; Akro con tacts Gagandewa for the last time by returning to the spring where they first met; and the croton symbolising the division of men from spirits is planted beside the Alulu River. In present-day Kaliai, moving water often serves as a boundary marker. Rivers and streams are the border lines between named parcels of land that belong to groups of agnatically related Kaliai who bear the same name as the tract of land with which they are associated. It is prob ably significant that Pulduvu was planted beside a river, for both the river and the plant seem to symbolise the establishment and recognition of boundaries that divide the living from the dead. However, water does not just serve to divide people. Springs, pools and lakes are gathering places where people from different villages or hamlets may meet, as the spring at the foot of Andewa served as the gathering spot for the people of the several spirit villages. In Kaliai mythology, meetings between humans and spirit creatures often take place near springs or rivers, while in the belief of the followers of the Kaliai cargo movement called the Story, spirit beings and ghosts are thought to live near a series of small lakes in the interior of New Britain where they reveal themselves to Story followers who perform the proper rituals. In Akro and Gagandewa springs are a point of juncture between the human and the spirit worlds. Akro and Gagandewa meet initially and have their final contact at a spring, and on both occasions when Gagandewa transports herself from the human world to Andewa, she</page><page sequence="22">54 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS does so from the location of a spring. Plants also mediate between opposing, contradictory states in Kaliai mythology. The opposition that exists between the categories life/death, human/non-human, our kin(d)/others, kinsmen/affines may be bridged by mediating plants of two kinds: plants that are used in their natural state and which are thought to possess special, sometimes magical, properties in and of themselves, and those domesticated edible plants that have social utility. Examples of those plants that have special, innate qualities are: ginger, which is an essential element in rituals of sorcery, curing, and fertility; tamaiao, which is probably Derris sp. from which the rotenone fish poison is derived and which is drunk by people who wish to commit suicide; and the croton, probably one of what Chowning (1961:41) calls "the croton group", Codiaeum variegatum, Cordyline fruticosa or Cycal rumhil or their close relatives. These plants are used throughout Melanesia for decorative, ritual, or magico-religious pur poses. In Kaliai the croton is symbolically linked with death. It is planted near graves, and the presence of a fenced croton in a Kaliai village signals that preparations for the final ceremony in a mortuary cycle have begun. There were, according to Jakob Mua Laopu, actually two crotons held by Gagandewa's father. One, held in his left hand was Pulduvu, and was planted as an expression of the permanent separation of men and spirits. An event which occurred in 1966 will illustrate the way in which this plant is used as a symbol of irrevocable division. At that time a meeting was called by the parents of a young couple who had been caught in an affair. The young woman's father expressed his belief that his daughter's seduction had been urged by the young man's father as an expression of his contempt for the girl's family. In reply, one of the boy's kinsmen commented that the statement was not to be taken seriously as it was only a ploy to get a large bridewealth. Angrily the girl's father replied, "Pulduvu fastens me." This statement permanently separated him from any bridewealth and, had the marriage taken place, the girl's father would have received none of it. The other croton, thrown down from Gagandewa's father's right hand, is called More Natem and is a symbol of death. It is used to brush flies from corpses, it is carried in mortuary ceremonies, and is planted around graves to communicate the message that the person buried there has become an ancestor (possibly living on Andewa). Plants with special or magical properties appear in the myth as mediators between the conditions of life and death. Intercourse between spirits and men begins when Akro and his comrades go to gather tamaiao, the plant of death, and he attracts the spirit woman because he has used a love potion. He has, in other words, by resorting to magic,</page><page sequence="23">A MELANESIAN MYTH 55 attempted to circumvent the normal social procedures for obtaining a wife. However, through his use of magic rather than social formulae he attracts, not a human woman, but a being from the spirit world. Finally, the end of all exchange between men and spirits and the demarcation of the boundary between life and death is symbolically emphasised by the planting of the croton near the Alulu River and on the top of Mount Andewa itself. The domesticated plants with social utility are of at least three kinds: cooked garden foods, domesticated plants such as sun-dried tobacco and areca nuts that are given in a natural state during ceremonial exchanges but which require preparation or the addition of culture in the form of fire before they can be used, and coconuts. These plants link men and antu in the myth just as they link groups of humans when they are given ceremonially or when they are exchanged as items of trade. Cooked foods, tobacco, and areca nuts are exchanged between groups of Kaliai people when their status with regard to each other is changed by a rite of passage. Food is exchanged, for example, by the kinsmen of the bride and bridegroom when their groups are aligned through marriage. It is exchanged again between people when they acknowledge the severing of a link by death. Cooked food is exchanged in these same situations in the myth. Gagandewa's kinsmen sent food to Akro's village as part of the initial step of establishing affinal and trade relations between the two groups, and Gagandewa left prepared taro and a half-cigar for Akro when she ended their relationship and returned to Andewa, the village of the dead. The use of cooked food to establish friendly relations and communica tion, whether between groups of humans or between humans and spirits, is important in Kaliai society as well as in Kaliai mythology. For exam ple, in 1967, the spirit of a recently dead child was enticed from its grave by promises of cooked food during a divination ritual held to determine the exact cause and agent of the child's death (Counts and Counts 1974). In Kaliai, areca nuts and coconuts appear to be symbolically associated with the opposed nature of the sexes. Coconuts seem to sym bolise the female essence and the ties of a person to his uterine kin, while the areca palm and its fruit apparently symbolise agnatic descent and male sexuality. The feminine symbolism of coconuts is explicated when one considers the uses to which coconut milk is put and the way in which coconuts are inherited. Kaliai say that a woman establishes her kinship to her child, not by carrying and bearing it, but by feeding it milk from her breasts. Her kinsmen symbolically perform this same act when they give their sister's children the milk of the green coconut, a food which may be used</page><page sequence="24">56 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS as a supplement to mother's milk by women whose breast supply is insuf ficient. Before coconuts achieved importance as cash crops, they were customarily inherited by a man's sister's children, and their use and inheritance were the principal symbolic links between wahaha (mother's brother/sister's son reciprocal term). In Akro and Gagandewa the feminine symbolism is explicit: the coconuts are Gagandewa's body. She says, "They [the coconut palms] are as a picture of me. My body is like the coconuts. My father even called these trees for me. . . . These coconuts are my body." Just as the coconuts are symbolically associated with female stuff, the areca palm is symbolic in Kaliai mythology of male sexuality and of the aolu 'ancestor figures' whose roles are always played by men and whose masks are stored in the men's houses away from the eyes of women and children. One Kaliai myth tells of the transformation of the first areca nuts into the aolu figures, while another myth explains how a culture heio taught women the proper way to chew areca nuts (with lime), and to have sexual intercourse. This lesson resulted in the red colour of both betel spittle and menstrual blood, and in human fertility. This symbolic signal is found elsewhere in New Guinea. Burridge (1969:248, 251) asserts that in the idiom of the Tangu, "areca-nut represents the curative and generative, areca-nuts resemble testicles, testicles and areca nuts are generative." Further, Tangu mythology notes that when areca nuts are chewed with lime the spittle is bright red. Redness is associated with the menstrual flow, with evidence of procreative capacity, and with blood and life. When the symbolism of coconuts and areca is understood, the failure of the child as a mediator takes on new meaning. In the myth Akro, Gagandewa, and the child are, contrary to normal Kaliai patterns, living uxorilocally when the child asks for his maternal grandfather's coconuts. This request is a valid one for, in Kaliai, a person has first claim to the coconuts belonging to his mother's kin, a claim that is balanced by gifts given by the father to his mother's people in the name of the child when he is initiated. These gifts, which always include vula and which are accompanied by the distribution of food, not only legitimise the position of a person vis-?-vis his maternal kinsmen but also publicly state that a father and his kin are able to meet their responsibilities to a child and thus have the right to recruit him into their kin group. These gifts were not made by Akro. When this is understood, the child's request can be seen as a legitimate one that places Akro in a position which, under the circumstances, would shame a self-respecting Kaliai father. His son expects to be able to share (and by implication inherit) certain of his maternal kinsmen's goods. He</page><page sequence="25">A MELANESIAN MYTH 57 has every right to hold this expectation. It is his father's responsibility to establish a relationship of reciprocity between the child and his maternal kin by making gifts to them in the child's name. As a result of the child's request, and with Gagandewa's urging, Akro climbs the coconut palm, and as he reaches to claim his child's uterine birthright he thinks of his own mother. Thus the coconuts, symbolic of the essence of motherhood and of femininity, femind him of his responsibilities as a son. So it is that the coconuts link the two women, Akro's wife and his mother, who are opposed in the myth, while they become the catalyst for events which lead to the tragic confrontation between the two, wife and mother. Once Akro is reminded of his duty as a son, he moves to correct the error of uxorilocal residence by establishing virilocal residence in con formity with the Kaliai norm. But Akro fails to meet all of the obliga tions he has as a man, and while satisfying his responsibility to his mother he fails to meet his obligation to his son. In clear contradiction of Kaliai custom, Akro allows gifts of food and vula to be sent with Gagandewa and the child to his kinsmen in Gering. Thus Akro fails in his responsibility as a father to provide his son with legitimate status vis-? vis his mother's kin, just as Akro's own father failed in his duty to pro vide Akro with a wife. Because of the irresponsibility of two generations of men, Akro's son is placed in an intolerable state of non-belonging. He is identified as Akro's son and thus does not rightfully belong with his mother's people. But at the same time he has not been initiated into his father's group. Gifts have not been made in his name to his mother's people, so he lacks full status as a human being and member of his father's line with complementary relations of exchange with his mother's kin. No place has been made for him in the social network; he is without social identity. This ambiguous situation cannot be endured for long. The child soon acts violently, destroying the areca palm planted by his paternal grandfather and tearing apart Akro's bed (in Kaliai when people say that one person has taken another's place they say that he has "taken his bed"). By this behaviour, then, the boy symbolically rejects his pater nal kin and expresses his inability to replace his father in the line of suc cession. He is, in turn, explicitly denied human status and rejected as a member of the community. This leaves Gagandewa and the child no alternative. They must sever all ties with Akro's people and return to Andewa where the child is fully identified with his mother's group. Although the Kaliai trace descent patrilineally and express a strong preference for virilocal residence, Akro and Gagandewa suggests that the claim of men to their children is a claim that must be socially verified by ritual and exchange for it to be valid. There is the sense that the claim of a mother on her children is a prior, a natural, claim, and that the pater</page><page sequence="26">58 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS nal claim is an artifice of culture. If society does not activate a man's claim in his children, the myth warns, then his claim is nullified and the children revert to their mother to whom they, by nature, belong. RULES OF PROPER BEHAVIOUR Mythical speculations, in the last analysis, do not seek to depict what is real but to justify the shortcomings of reality, since the extreme positions are only imagined in order to show that they are untenable (L?vi-Strauss 1967:25). Akro and Gagandewa is a tragedy of errors teaching by negative exam ple. Rather than reflecting Kaliai culture as it really is, the myth explores the result should people defy the conventions of Kaiiai society. The obligations of kinship and affinity are not met; a son is not provided with a wife, and a husband does not make gifts to his wife's brothers in the name of his child. The rules of residence are violated, and when that error is corrected gifts flow in the wrong direction, from the wife-givers rather than to them. A woman who comes into her husband's village bringing wealth and opportunity is rejected and she and her child are slandered. What, then, does this mythic portrayal of the violation of the norms of Kaliai social reality teach about that reality? This paper will examine only a few of the many complex lessons taught in Akro and Gagandewa. First, the message is clear that sex and marriage are dangerous endeavours, particularly if individual sexual needs are permitted to dic tate marital arrangements, as is the case in the myth. Marriage has too much social importance to be left to the caprice of individuals, and randy ones at that. Akro, whose father's negligence has left him without a wife, uses love magic designed to arouse desire in women in the hope that he will attract one who will marry him. His attempt to operate through other than normal procedure succeeds, but instead of attracting a human he attracts a spirit whose desire for him has been so greatly aroused that she cmpels him to marry her. This marriage breaks several rules. It is not publicly arranged between the parents of the couple with bridewealth being given, as is proper, but it is contracted between the individuals in secret. Further, Gagandewa is ineligible to marry. She is in a state of seclusion and has not yet been presented to society as a marriageable woman. Sexual relationships are forbidden to her. This marriage thus contracted, in violation of Kaliai taboos, in the absence of proper rituals, and without establishing the normal social alliances of affinity and reciprocity, is disastrous for both Akro and his village. He is placed at the mercy of strangers (his affines) who have the option of killing him if they wish; his movements are restricted and he is</page><page sequence="27">A MELANESIAN MYTH 59 isolated from others of his kind and placed in a state of symbolic death; he fails to meet his social obligations, either to his wife's kinsmen or to his own son; the thread of kinship linking him through his father to the past and through his son to the future is broken, and he is finally led to murder his own mother. Not only does his marriage fail to enable Akro to reproduce himself and maintain the continuity of his kin group, it also leads to the social destruction of Akro and his entire line. The com munity also loses all the economic benefits that might result from the marriage alliance and suffers, through warfare, the death of many of its members. The message is clear: as costly in time and resources as a proper Kaliai marriage may be, the alternative?marriage contracted between individuals and based on sexual desire?is personally and socially destructive and thus unacceptable. Marriage is a social relation ship that must be founded in and by society rather than nature. A second message of the myth revolves around the fact that this unfor tunate marriage would not have taken place had the obligations of kinsmen to one another been met in the first place. As Leach (1970:80) observes, "The disaster always originates in the circumstances that a human being fails to fulfil his or her proper obligation toward a deity or a kinsman." Here the behaviour of the antu, who consistently meet their obliga tions, is contrasted with the behaviour of the humans who provide a case study in how affairs ought not to be managed. Consider, for example, the duties of a father to his child as they appear in the myth. A father has a duty to support his child when he passes from one social stage to another. There are rituals to be performed when a daughter reaches puberty, and a father is responsible for seeing that his son has a wife and is thus able to enter full manhood. A father also is obliged to establish his child's relationship with the child's maternal group. Sharing is a right of kinship, and exchange defines the boundaries of the kin group. It is, therefore, the father's responsibility to give gifts to the mother's kin in the child's name so that it is established that, although the child exchanges with his mother's kinsmen and thus cannot be a member of their group, he has a right, as a child of their kinswoman, to share part of their wealth. He is from them but not one of them, and he deals with them in a delicate balance of reciprocity and sharing that must be established for him by his closest elder kinsman, his father. Both Akro and his father fail in their paternal responsibilities, while Gagandewa's father is, by contrast, on every occasion a big-man. Akro does not give gifts to Gagandewa's kinsmen in the name of his son. Instead he is cared for by Gagandewa's group, and when Akro and Gagandewa go to his village, gifts are made to his people to ensure the</page><page sequence="28">60 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS child's welfare, in direct contradiction to the rules of proper procedure. Gagandewa's father meets not only his own responsibilities but some of those of Akro and his kinsmen as well. He completes the rituals that attend Gagandewa's entry into womanhood; he is careful to see that her husband is protected and cared for even though no bridewealth has been given; he supports Akro when he wishes to exercise his right as a husband and take Gagandewa and his son to Gering, while at the same time reminding Gagandewa that she may return home if she is mistreated; he sends gifts to Akro's people in payment for their proper treatment of the child of one of their own fellows; and he opens relations of exchange with his affines that are clearly advantageous to them. Again the message is clear. The obligations of kinship may be a burden, but to ignore them brings disaster. The failure of a father to pro vide for his children may result in their loss and in the end of his kin line. The failure of a person to treat properly with his affines may result in the termination of relationship, and in enmity, warfare, and destruction. The consequence of social irresponsibility is social death. A third lesson of Akro and Gagandewa concerns the related matters of residence, the complementary rights and duties of husbands and wives, and the relative position of the sexes. Th? myth is explicit in its statement of the supremacy of the Kaliai male and husband. "You are my master", Gagandewa tells Akro. "I am only a woman. I must follow your will. I cannot, as a woman, force you to do my will." Taken at face value, the myth asserts that the Kaliai woman should be submissive to her husband; the Kaliai man is, by right, master in his house. But, consider the events of the myth in contrast to Gagandewa's words. From the first, Akro's fate is determined by women. He has no wife and uses love magic in an effort to attract one. He attracts Gagandewa and she takes control of the situation. Akro cannot escape her. She clouds his mind, compels him to marry her and separates him from his companions, fellow-humans, and kin. She restricts his mobility, hiding him in the kailanga and forbidding him to look at or think of other women. Finally she offers him to her kinsmen to kill and eat. She restricts Akro's activities in the village while protecting him, and it is she who reminds the reluctant Akro of his male rights and initiates their move to Gering. Once in Gering it is Gagandewa who brings wealth and the advantages of trading alliance to the humans. The child is always referred to in Gering as her son, and it is, finally, con flict between the two women, Akro's wife and mother, that brings disaster. Thus the myth expresses an insoluble paradox. Women are essential to men. They give birth to men and to their sons, but the same women who give life and make possible economic and political alliance and the continuance of kin groups to which they do not belong, may</page><page sequence="29">A MELANESIAN MYTH 61 destroy life, alliance, and lineage. Thus women, while being formally subordinate, control the fate of men. They bring life, but also conflict and death, to men. Akro and Gagandewa is also explicit with regard to the rights of a hus band over his wife and children. It is the right of a husband to take his wife and children to live in his village, and it is the duty of his wife to follow him. Furthermore, it behoves her kinsmen not to interfere in their relationship, for once she is married a woman is no longer a child to be looked after by them but a woman who is responsible to her husband. However, the myth also contains a warning that complements the state ment of male rights. Although a man has rights over his wife and children, those rights must be legitimised by proper ritual and by reciprocal exchange. If a man fails to do this, his rights may be jeopar dised, for it is also the right of a woman to return to her kinsmen if she is mistreated. It is this right that Gagandewa's father reminds her that she has, while exhorting her to behave properly, and it is this right that he underscores by his gifts to Akro's kinsmen for their acceptance and care of the child. The myth teaches, therefore, that a woman is protected because her kinsmen have a continued interest in her and in her children. They will allow her to return to her home if she wishes to for good reason, and they will avenge her if she is mistreated. Although there is a norm of virilocal residence in Kaliai, a norm that has its basis in the stated rights of a husband over his wife and children, uxorilocal residence is sometimes practised. The myth warns that although virilocal residence is preferred, each form of residence has its dangers. If a couple live uxorilocally, as Akro and Gagandewa do initially, then, the myth suggests, the ability of the man to live a complete, active life is severely restricted. All the time that they live in Andewa, Akro's movements are circumscribed. Initially he is confined in Gagandewa's 'seclusion house' and is denied all other companionship. Even after he is presented to the community he is still severely limited. He is in danger from the hostile spirits who live at the edge of Andewa and so he cannot leave the village or even wander too close to its edge. He may not hunt or garden, and he is forced to remain monogamous, for Gagandewa exer cises complete and exclusive control over his sexuality. Further, he is under her protection and, should he defy her, he places himself in peril. Although uxorilocal residence places the man at a disadvantage and the woman in a position of strength, this arrangement benefits neither of them. Her situation is defined by her husband's, and his incapacity limits the maturity of them both. As long as Akro and Gagandewa remain in Andewa they do not perform the duties expected of married adults; they</page><page sequence="30">62 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS are sexually active but dependent children. Gagandewa's duties as a wife are to gather water; to care for pigs; to cook for her husband, children and pigs; to bear and nurture children; and to work in the garden. Except for bearing and nurturing their child, Gagandewa herself performs none of these duties until they move to Gering. By the same token, Akro per forms none of the duties, except sexual service, that are usually required of a husband. He does not build their house, he does not work in the garden, he does not engage in ceremonial activities or in relationships of exchange. As long as they live in Andewa almost all of this work is done for them by Gagandewa's kinsmen: they are non-productive, non reciprocal and socially immature. It is not until they take up virilocal residence that they become responsible, contributing adults who par ticipate in ceremonial activities and take their place in the normal activities of adult society. Uxorilocal residence, then, is an unsatisfactory arrangement, and a man has the right to insist that his wife and children settle in his village among his own kin. But this arrangement brings into focus another insoluble dilemma?virilocal residence, which is proper, brings together two of the women who are closest to a man but who are not members of his own group, his wife and his mother. This proximity opens the possibility of destructive conflict between the two, particularly if they are members of different kin groups. The conflict between Gagandewa and Akro's mother is symbolically foretold in the myth. After his long seclu sion with Gagandewa, Akro comes from the 'seclusion house' carrying a vao 'wooden sword' made by him during his hiding. The vao, which is about five feet long, had two major uses in traditional Kaliai. It was used in warfare, and it was used by her son to kill a widow who wished to die. Akro's emergence from the 'seclusion house' carrying the vao may well signal the tragedy to follow, the warfare, and the conflict between the two women that results in Akro's loss of Gagandewa and his slaying of his mother. The Kaliai have two means of containing the potential conflict between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. One means is avoidance. Affines in Kaliai do not call each other by name, either in address or in reference, and they seldom speak directly to one another. However, avoidance would not prevent the conflict in Akro and Gagandewa, for the hostility between the two women is never directly expressed. Rather it is mediated through the child. Another means of containing the potential hostility between a man's wife and mother is matrilateral cross-cousin marriage. This arrangement will result in the two women being as mother and daughter to one another and is the preferred marital arrangement in Kaliai. However, it does not usually occur if the marriage is contracted</page><page sequence="31">A MELANESIAN MYTH 63 by the concerned couple rather than by their parents (arranged marriages often fail to follow this pattern too, but that is irrelevant here). Thus the myth reflects that marriages contracted by individuals do not usually follow the ideally preferred marital patterns of Kaliai society, and it warns that there are dangers inherent in a marital arrangement in which the mother and the wife are alien to each other and thus prime candidates for mutual suspicion, hostility, jealousy, and conflict. Another warning contained in the myth is the caution that, although a husband has the right to bring his wife to live among his own people, associated with this right are the obligations that he, and by extension his kin and community, have towards his foreign wife. It is most important that, no matter how strange she may be, she must not be treated as an outsider. "You must never call her an antuy\ Akro warns, "she is just like we are." Although the woman is a foreigner who looks different and comes from a strange land, she is not a stranger, she is not different, and she must not be treated as such. She has married into the community, she will bear the community's children and thus assure its continuance in time, and she must be accepted as one of them. She has, for all practical purposes, become one of them. The myth also reminds its listeners that the foreign woman who mar ries into a community has kinsmen who have the right to protect her and who will avenge her if she is mistreated. As long as the woman lives with them, Akro tells his people, all will be well. But should she leave them, all their good fortune will end. Here again the correct behaviour of the spirits is contrasted with the incorrect behaviour of the humans. The spirits are scrupulous in their attention to social niceties. They take total care of Akro, Gagandewa and the child, providing them with all their food and allowing them to live in ease. When Akro wishes to return to Gering they willingly release him and send great wealth with him to his kinsmen. The humans, in contrast, take advantage of the exchange rela tionship offered by the antu but make no gifts for the child. Finally, Akro's mother slanders Gagandewa and causes her to flee in shame, an act of rejection for which the entire village is held to be corporately responsible. This lesson, that society may be held responsible for the actions of its individual members, seems to be the resolution offered for the question repeatedly returned to in the myth: what is a human being? This problem is explored as the myth asks: Are dead men human? Are spirits? Are others, whose culture is alien, fully human? Is the individual, outside of society, a human being? Can he, a lone individual, engage in social acts? There seems to be no final answer offered to the question of the status of ghosts, spirits, and alien others. They may appear to be human, yet be</page><page sequence="32">64 DOROTHY AYERS COUNTS inhumanly different. They may be alien but also like us, capable of becoming one of us and bearing our children. But there is little uncer tainty about the status of the individual. A person is truly human only as he exists within a social framework. Society defines humanity. The acts of a person, rooted in his nature, are not social acts, for only that behaviour which is patterned according to the rules and conventions of society is social behaviour. A person must submit himself to society and be governed by its rules, not by his nature, for he is defined by and is responsible to his society as it is responsible for him. This must be understood and behaviour adjusted accordingly or the result, for both the individual and his society, will be disaster and death.
