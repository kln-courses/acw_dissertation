<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1992 The Business Ethic of the World Religions and the Spirit of Capitalism* Lowell L. Bennion Ten years after the publication of "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism" Weber presented the social sciences with an ambitious series of essays on the "Business Ethic of the World Religions." This series was cut short by his untimely death in 1920. As it stands it includes a study of Confucianism and Taoism, Buddhism and Hinduism, ancient Judaism, and a short appendage on the Pharisees. It was his intention to supplement the study of ancient Judaism with an analysis of the Psalms and the Book of Job. Treatises on Talmudic Judaism, the Islam, and early Christianity had been outlined and would have completed this extensive piece of research had he been able to continue his work. Weber makes no attempt in this study to present, in any sense of the word, a complete picture of the world religions. Nor does he give us a full systematic analysis of the business ethic of these religions. His analysis is systematic inasmuch as he proceeds with a definite aim in view. He thus selects those elements of the historical reality of the various ethics of the religions under consideration which he is able to bring into a context for comparative and contrasting purposes. That which is irrelevant is neglected. His aim is to ascertain the practical ethic of the respective religions for comparative purposes. He offers the results of his study of the Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism as a necessary presupposition for under? standing these later essays. The Occident has produced practical rational conduct in every-day life, a product of ascetic Protestantism. That manner of life gave birth to the spirit of modern capitalism. The result was our modern capitalistic order. The great civilizations of the Orient produced no such order. Why not? That is the specific question of the remaining *Excerpted with minor editorial changes from Lowell L. Bennion, Max Weber's Methodology, Les Presses Modernes, 1933. Paris: Reprinted with permission. 39</page><page sequence="2">40 Bennion essays. The answer is to be sought by comparing and contrasting the busi? ness ethic of the world religions with that of ascetic Protestantism in its classic Puritan form. The business ethic of the world religions will be dis? cussed in its relation to that particular form of "economic rationalism" practiced by the Puritans. The emphasis will be placed quite naturally on the differences. The underlying problem remains that of materialism as an adequate historical method. Weber states: Interests (both material and ideal) and not ideas directly determine the conduct of man. However, the views of life born of ideas and serving as switchmen have very often determined the tracks which conduct took, impelled by the dynamics of in? terests1. It becomes Weber's task to discover the views of life and to understand the religious ideas which created them. To comprehend them he dos not look to ... the ethical theory of theological compendia which serve only as a means of knowledge (which may be, however, under certain conditions of great importance), but to the practical impulses of conduct, founded on the psychological and prag? matical context of the different religions.2 Human conduct is the point of departure. Weber is chiefly interested in the conduct of those groups of individuals who have had the most influence on the practical ethic and manner of life of their respective religious groups. In this section we make no pretension of presenting Weber's argu? ment completely, but restrict ourselves to defining his terms and illustrating his method by outstanding parts of the text. Although Weber never devel? oped a finished method, he had turned sociologist at the stage of his writ? ing. He handles his subject matter both as a historian and as a sociologist. Weber considers religions as historical individuals. They may best be understood in their full development as a type of authoritative group ("Herrschaftsverband"). They represent authoritative associations which enjoy a monopoly of authority supported by the ability to give or withhold salvation ("Heilsg?ter"). All religious and political groups are based in the last analysis on authority or power. They may best be understood by as? certaining the legitimate foundation of this power, or the means by which this authority is maintained. Weber postulates certain types of authority. They are ideal types and never occur in pure form in reality. However, all associations in which man rules over man may be understood by comparing them with these ideal types. All are approaches to, deviations from, or com? binations of these types. ^eber., Ges. Aufsetze zur Religionssoziologie, Vol. I, p. 252. 2Ibid., p. 238.</page><page sequence="3">Business Ethic of World Religions 41 The first and oldest form Weber designates as "charismatic," a term which he coins for this purpose. Under "charisma" he understands the magical or supernatural ("ausseralltaegliche")3 quality of a person. "Char? ismatic" authority is the external or internal rule of man over man made possible by the faith of the ruled in this supernatural power of the ruler. This authority is neither traditionalistic nor rational, but is based on the ability of the ruling persons to perpetuate the belief of their subjects in the magical or supernatural character of their activities. The most typical examples of "charismatic" bearers of authority are the magician and the prophet who maintain their positions as long as their magic and revelations verify themselves in the eyes of their subjects. The second type, which very often although not always is an out? growth of charisma, is traditionalism. In contrast with the former, tradi? tionalism is based on pious devotion to and confidence in that which is of every-day occurrence as an unbridgeable norm for conduct. This tradition? alist rule of man over man is based on the faith in that which has always been. Its typical representatives are patriarchs, elders of the clan, feudal lords, and similar groups. The allegiance to traditionalism is based on the personal relations between the ruler and the ruled, leaving play for the grace and arbitrariness of the ruler. This stamps its character as being es? sentially irrational. Generally speaking, the purer forms of traditionalism, such as patri? archy, evolved into patrimonial types. The question of succession in "char? ismatic" organizations led to the creation of rules to determine succession. The magical power of "charisma" and the every-day, commonplace power of traditionalism gave way to a secularization. Disciples and apostles be? came priests and officials. The new organization was supported, not by gifts, loot, charities, nor the communistic living of the "charismatic" groups, but by taxes, rents, dues, and wages.4 This evolution led to Weber's third ideal type, the legal type, which is based on impersonal rules and norms. Its typical representative is the bureaucratic rule made possible by the victory of the formal juridic rationalism of the Occident. All three types and every thinkable combination of them are to be found in the modern Occident. The rationalized, methodical living of the Puritan typifies for Weber the purest form of rational living to be found among religions. It was the great movements of Protestant asceticism which eliminated magic from the world and removed the path of salvation from the contemplative flight from the world to an ascetic remodeling of the world. Again it was the knowledge 3No English equivalent is to be found for this excellent German expression which signifies the supernatural, magical, unusual character of a person or object. The German antonym is alltaeglich. 4See Ibid., p. 270.</page><page sequence="4">42 Bennion and application of the means to attain self-postulated and irrational pur? poses which gave ascetic Protestantism its rational character which stands out in sharp relief from the ethic of the "charismatic" and traditionalistic world religions.5 What is the source of this rule of man over man, whether it be po? litical or religious? Weber recognizes the influence of political, social, and economic forces which have moulded and formed ethical and religious ideas. At the same time it is the ethic, the disposition to certain types of conduct, which has directed the formation of groups and institutions. The origin of this ethic and conduct is to be found chiefly in religious sources. Religious ideas are the source of certain dispositions and attitudes which make possible religious and social organization based on authority. Religious ideas develop from religious needs. Weber discusses some of them sketchily as an empirical psychologist. We shall present some of them here to clarify his thesis. One of the eternal needs of man has been and is an explanation of suffering. These explanations have undergone an interesting, continual change. Originally, suffering was considered generally as something to be hated and was looked upon disdainfully. The chronic sufferer was detested, if not cast out. He was possessed with demons. His presence was a source of anger and displeasure to the gods. Such an atti? tude toward suffering satisfied psychologically another religious need?an explanation of a state of happiness and well being. This right to possess and enjoy happiness was a blessing from the gods and met with their ap? proval. In a later development the phenomenon of suffering received a cer? tain halo as an explanation and source of magical ("ausseralltaegliche") powers necessary to "charisma." Suffering became a typical condition in? cluded in thought and life by the "charismatic" leaders who capitalized upon it to perpetuate their power. Individual salvation from suffering be? came a need of all individuals. Confession of sins, and other rituals of di? verse character grew up around this phenomenon. A further development is represented in the savior-religiousness which contains elements of a ra? tional view of life. From this universal need of salvation from suffering originated the various forms of a theodicy of suffering. The increasing rationalization of the world made theodicy more difficult. Not only suffering but the maldis? tribution of material and immaterial goods also needed a religious justifi? cation. This rational need for an explanation of suffering, of maladjustments of all kinds, and death, gave most religious movements such 5The Hebrew prophets were the forerunners of the Puritans in eliminating magic from the world. Their role will be discussed later.</page><page sequence="5">Business Ethic of World Religions 43 as Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, and even Christianity to a great ex? tent, their specific character. There are only three possible, rational justi? fications of suffering, according to Weber. These are represented in (1) the Indian, Karma teachings; (2) the Zoroastrian dualism; (3) the predes? tination decree of the "Deus absconditus."6 Release from and justification of suffering are supplemented in re? ligion by the positive desire for the goods of salvation. These are essentially of a worldly character: long life, health, and wealth. Even in those cases where they are considered as being otherworldly, the immediate character of the desired state of salvation is retained. In each case, psychologically speaking, a person in search of salvation is striving for a feeling of self worth which satisfies his present religious needs. That is just as true of the Lutheran search for "unio mystica" as of the Puritan struggle to maintain the "certitudo salutis." The goods of salvation sought by different classes in society are very different in character. The intellectual classes incline toward a contemplative resigning spirit, an escape from the meaningless world. The intellectual, being unable to give a meaning to the individual irrational phenomena in the world, requires a rational conception of the cosmos as a whole. In his contemplative search for this harmonious, mean? ingful element, he escapes from the world to become the vessel of an im? personal, often vaguely conceived God or gods. Other groups, such as the knights and tradesmen or a hierarchy of officials, tended to dampen the individual contemplative search for salvation common to the Indian relig? ions. The Church rationalized, placing itself between the individual and salvation. In connection with the different goods of salvation Weber mentions two forms of prophethood which aimed to rationalize the problem of re? ligious needs. The one he terms exemplary, the other, emissary prophethood. The exemplary prophethood is typified in the great Indian religions. There it is intellectual and contemplative, holding the individual to be a vessel of God; emissary prophethood is that type indigenous among the practical "bourgeois" classes. Here man was not the vessel but the tool of the spirit of God. The conception of man as being a tool of God was intimately related to the idea of a universal, personal, all-powerful, creative God. We shall have occasion to refer to the relations between religious ideas and social stratification as we proceed with the discussion of the "Business Ethic of the World Religions." Important for the understanding of Weber's essay is his distinction between profane and sacred things. Profane is that which is of every-day 6See Weber, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 247.</page><page sequence="6">44 Bennion occurrence; sacred are those unusual ("ausseralltaegliche") happenings which are easily adaptable to magical and supernatural attributes. CONFUCIANISM AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM Weber devotes considerable space in his essay on Confucianism and Taoism in laying the sociological foundations of Chinese culture which have bearing on the particular thesis he presents. We are compelled to mention but briefly some of his characteristic connotations pertaining to the retard? ing or furthering of the spirit of capitalism. What economic and social con? ditions, generally considered as "necessary" stipulations for the development of modern capitalism, existed in China? The Chinese are able trades and business men. Their business inclinations are just as strong and their industry just as zealous as that of other races. In fact, they have main? tained themselves individually very well in competition with other peoples. This fact can be attested to by anyone who has spent time in the Hawaiian Islands or among the Chinese in the United States. From the very earliest times China has known and used metals as money. Before the seventh cen? tury B.C. stamped silver bars were used as a medium of exchange. Specie was introduced soon after its origin in Lydia. Throughout Antiquity and the Middle Ages China had, generally speaking, an abundance of gold, sil? ver, and copper coins. From 1516 A.D on, an exceedingly large influx of precious metals from the New World was received by China in exchange for her specialties. In spite of this fact, capitalism was given no appreciable impetus. The increase of precious metals led to the further development of a financial system and an economy in terms of money but no further. There is no Chinese word for usury. The Chinese enjoyed a freedom in this respect unknown to the same period in the Occident. According to Chinese figures, which are open to serious doubt, the population increased from sixty million in 1650 to from three to four hun? dred million in 1900. The Chinese enjoyed freedom of trade and a religious toleration unheard of in the Occident. There was, in addition, an absence of slavery in China. All these factors are said to be favorable to the phe? nomenon of Western capitalism and yet they led to no capitalistic innova? tions in China. Why not? This fact may be answered by citing other economic and social con? ditions which counteracted favorable stipulations or at least retarded their development. Weber is not ignorant of these circumstances. China had only one seaport, her commerce being largely domestic. Furthermore, her wa? terways, on which trade depended so much, were not regulated. She had no colonies nor over-sea connections, thus developing no pirate capitalism.</page><page sequence="7">Business Ethic of World Religions 45 These and other economic factors alone would not have impeded capital? istic development. The solution is to be found in social stratification and political structure. These have their roots not only in economic and geo? graphical factors, but also in the ethical disposition and religious ideas of the Chinese. It was lack of an economic rationalism which deterred the development of a modern, Occidental capitalism in China. She had no great methodical conception of rational business; no industrial enterprises similar to those of Europe; no accumulation of capital; no commercial organization of the means of communication; no rational monetary system. Her consid? erable supply of money was neither centralized nor standardized and was, therefore, unsuitable for exact calculations. China had but the beginnings of legal institutions and these only in corporation law, commercial law, and limited legal rules pertaining to bills of exchange and securities. Truly tech? nical, usable accounting and bookkeeping systems were unknown. More? over, rational war, giving the possible and usual opportunity for war loans and the rationalization of competition among dealers in furnishing supplies, is not to be found in China's chronicle. No capitalism, in the modern Oc? cidental meaning of the term, originated because of the absence of eco? nomic and practical rationalism, Weber believes. The reason that this was not developed is to be found in the last analysis in the business ethic and religious ideas of the Chinese. On the whole, the central political authority in China has always been incompetent. As a result, a lax irrational administration and an inadequate dispensation of justice have impeded the development of capitalism. China has known what one might call commercial capitalism and the accumulation of wealth on the part of officials and tradesmen; however, industrial capi? talism, the specific Occidental form which grew up in the workshops of Western Europe, remained undeveloped. Industrial capitalism presupposes reckonable legal protection of the individual and cannot exist under irra? tional arbitrary rule. Although China was, in contrast with Japan and India, a country of cities, these did not serve the rise of capitalism as one might expect. The Chinese cities were not political centers in the Greek or Occidental sense of the word. They did not give birth to legal systems and strong political combinations. In fact, a large proportion of their inhabitants dwelt there as strangers, still recognizing the village and clan as their home and as the recipients of their allegiance. The village remained the community center in which both authority and organization were based on the clan. Business was transacted and justice rendered in the village temple which was also the seat of arms. The organization and life of the village remained "char? ismatic" and traditional. Several attempts were made by Chinese emperors</page><page sequence="8">46 Bennion to centralize and rationalize the village administration. Each time they failed to break permanently the bonds of traditionalism. Why? One answer to this question lies in the status of the Chinese official and office seeker, the mandarin. The mandarins were theoretically paid by the central government, at first in kind and later in money. However, this form of payment remained but a small portion of their means of livelihood. The greatest part they derived from taxes. The mandarins and their staffs were the only officials between the taxpayers and the central authorities. A definite amount of money was demanded from each mandarin peri? odically by the government. This sum was generally fixed for all time. The official had to pay it. What he collected above that amount and the pay for his personnel and expenses, he could keep as profit. The central gov? ernment was interested only in the fixed amount due it and had no record or control of gross income. The mandarin worked desperately and irration? ally to obtain as much as possible for himself. His incentive was stimulated by the fact that his term of office in one place was only three years. Al? though the officialism as a whole was very secure, the individual mandarin found himself, for this reason, in a precarious position and quite naturally sought his advantage. Each mandarin had originally paid dearly for his po? sition in presents and bribes which made his preparation extremely expen? sive. The frequent change and removal of officials were practiced to prevent their aggrandizement of political power. Such an irrational exploitable tax system reacted unfavorably to methodical business enterprises. The tax? payer under such a system cherished the one principle, no new non-tradi? tional payments. Thus both officials and the taxed strove to preserve the traditional, irrational order. The loosely applied designation of democracy in connection with an? cient China had absolutely nothing in common with modern democracy. It was solely the expression of (1) the disappearance of feudal social stratification; (2) the extensiveness of patrimonial-bureaucratic administration; (3) the unbroken and unquestionable power of the patriarchal clans.7 The fact that feudalism never regained a foothold in China prevented a power from originating between the mandarins and the individuals taxed. Chinese land on the whole remained in the hands of the small farmers ("bazillen" lands). This fact hindered rational farming on a large scale which might have served as an intermediary step toward Western capital? ism. The mandarins were highly influential in retarding feudalism. They were also enemies of economic interests except, of course, their own. Since they formed a class which had accumulated wealth, one wonders that no 7Ibid., Vol. 1, p. 386.</page><page sequence="9">Business Ethic of World Religions 47 capitalism was developed by them. The explanation can be found in their business ethic and education. The mandarins belonged to the intellectual class of China. Their education was based on the Chinese classics. It was a literary education, not systematic nor technical. Arithmetic and mathe? matics were almost missing in their curriculum. Chinese philosophy was not systematic, rational or dialectic, but was oriented to practical problems, class interests, and patrimonial bureaucracy. The famous system of "civil service" examinations practiced in China had a purely mundane character, but was lacking in technic. The common people attached a magical char? acter to these examinations. The mandarins shared the "charisma" with the monarch. Confucianism was created by the mandarins in their necessarily united struggle against the usurpation of their power by such groups as the feudal lords or men of commerce. It was accepted by the leading and intellectual classes of China. Although it was threatened by "heresies" and the formation of sects, which were tolerated in China, it maintained its position of supremacy. What was the religious nature of Confucianism? The word religion does not exist in the Chinese language. The Chinese term for Confucianism ("ju Kiao") means "teachings of the men of let? ters." It can hardly be termed a religion in the generally accepted meaning of the word in the Occident. The interest in eternal life was subordinated to mundane interests. The idea of God remained long contradictory in Chinese thought. In Confucianism there is not a clear conception of a personal God. Individual prayer was not practiced. Devotion took place in the form of ritual and ceremony. The intellectual classes used their influence on the masses to prevent the coming forth or orgiastic compo? nents of an animistic religiousness. They did everything in their power to stamp out prophethood. It is Weber's theory that the prophets were en? abled to maintain their position elsewhere by reason of their satisfying a religious need of the poorer classes. The prophets reconciled the sense of honor of the lower classes by promising them salvation in another world which would surpass the comforts of the rich in this life. This need was not felt by Confucianists. The idea of salvation with its concepts of sin, damnation, and judg? ment has no place in Confucianism. Man is good and not in a fallen state. All men are considered as being good and, therefore, originally as equal. Education and wealth account for differences. The world is ruled not by the God of creation. Yahveh, but by heaven, perpetuator of an undisturbed continuity. The religious power is unchangeable and eternal in contrast with that of the feared and threatening Creator-God of the Jews. The resulting ethic stands out in sharp relief from both Buddhistic and Protestant ethics. In Confucianism both the world order and man are</page><page sequence="10">48 Bennion good. It is not a question of fleeing from the world, as in Buddhism, nor one of remodeling the world in a struggle for the feeling of election as in Puritanism. Confucianism teaches accommodation to the world. This re? quires no innovation of character, no ascetic living nor personal diligence, but only piety toward the world order. When maladjustments occur they are caused by breach of ritual, tradition or piety. The cultural ideals of the Chinese are prosperity and learning. The cultured gentleman of material means and general education is their ideal. He is expected to love his friends and be upright in his dealings with his enemies. The principle of reciprocity permeates the Chinese social ethic. Economic well-being is not a goal in itself, but is a means of obtaining an education and leading the life of a gentleman. The disciples of Confucius cherished no concept of a calling in which they should work as instruments in the hand of God for His glory. Nor did they consider themselves as vessels of the Holy Spirit as the Lutherans were wont to do. In sharp contrast with the Puritan ethic, the concept of personality remained undeveloped in Confucianism. "Life (of the Chinese) remained a series of events."8 The Chinese felt no tension between himself and a God of creation nor between himself and the world. God and the universe were one. "The Puritan worked to change his character, the Chinese to improve his gestures and manners."9 The Chinese lacked the religiously motivated rational manner of living emanating from within himself. His aim was not salvation nor election but harmony with an eternal order. Even when this harmony was disrupted, through shortage of rain and crop failure, he felt no guilt. Heaven or those endowed with "charismatic" powers, the monarch and the mandarins, were responsible. Without recapitulating, the differences between the ethical influence on the conduct of the Puritan and on that of the Confucianist are evident. Both movements were rational in their practical effects. The former meant a remodeling of the world, the latter an adjustment to the world. The origi? nal "charismatic" character of the Chinese ethic has remained. Confucian? ism signified an evolution of "charisma" to traditionalism. However, the "charismatic" character of conduct remained among the masses. The bonds of traditionalism and magic remained sealed, preventing the development of the rational methodical spirit in every-day life. Weber concludes that the singular "Weltanschauung" of the Chinese was one of the most impor? tant influences in preventing the development of a pure economically ori? ented capitalism. 8Ibid., p. 521. 9See Ibid., pp. 530-531.</page><page sequence="11">Business Ethic of World Religions 49 HINDUISM AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM It is well-known fact that capitalism was imported into India. Since its introduction it has been accepted but slowly and by a small proportion of the population. Here, as in the previous study, the question is, why did not a form of capitalism similar to that of the modern Occident develop independently in India? The often proposed theory that Indian climatic conditions have resulted in enervation, Weber contradicts firmly. The belief that enervating effects produced by climatic conditions is the reason for the supposed Hindu languidness is entirely unfounded. No country in the world has known the violent, permanent war and the most unscrupulous lust for conquest so fully unrestrained and so abundantly as has India.10 The Hindu is, as a matter of fact, an industrious, hard-working indi? vidual, being recognized in India as a better workman than the Mo? hammedan. In native disposition and ability in economic life the Hindu character is not wanting. Numerous important economic prerequisites favorable to the rise of capitalism have long existed in India. Domestic commerce was highly de? veloped. For centuries India had carried on a large and quite profitable foreign trade with the Occident. Usury was practiced freely at a time when it was condemned in the Occident. Jews were at home in southern India. Since the seventh century B.C. there has been a considerable supply of money suitable for trade. Coins were first issued by private interests. In the first century A. D. they were coined by the kings. In fact, the market, where goods would be bought and sold, appeared in this same period in a similar state of growth as did the markets of Italy. Capital was not only accumulated through land rents but also through commercial undertakings. Cities, especially along the seacoast, sprang up from what had previously been mere fortifications of princes. Capitalistic beginnings had been made and developed considerably, analogous in many ways to those of the Middle Ages in the Occident. Political conditions were in many instances favorable to capitalism. Political unity existed for generations. Indian law was as encouraging to capitalistic interests as was the law of the Middle Ages in Western Europe. Politics and the financial structure were rationalistic. The warfare of the princes was rational, exhibiting for example, an early use of artillery. In contrast with China, important rational elements of science and business were applied by the Hindus. "The modern, rational system of num? bers, the foundation of all calculation, is of Indian origin."11 The Hindus 10Ibid., Vol. II, p. 133. nIbid., p. 3.</page><page sequence="12">50 Bennion cultivated rational sciences, especially mathematics and grammar. India was greatly influenced by the enlightenment of the great Mogul, emperor of Hindustan, at the close of the sixteenth century. Trades and specialization of labor were well advanced, There was very little anti-chrematistics, the accumulation of riches being appreciable. Finally, tolerance in religious and philosophical thinking was nearly absolute, certainly far greater than in Western civilization. What then impeded the further progress of such promising capitalistic beginnings? Weber uncovers economic, social, and political conditions that retarded further economic development. A peculiar reverence for simple, hand-made tools resulted in their becoming stereotyped which obstructed every technical advancement. This reverence was cherished by the Cudra castes and was based on magical and traditional motives. The branches of production were strictly separated from each other. Within the diverse castes competition was eliminated and economic existence assured by di? vision of patronage among the artisans. This divided patronage was further maintained by inheritance. An intrusion into the other fellow's sphere of patronage was sufficient reason for excommunication from the caste. Ex? communication always meant a lowering of one's social status. In many instances land was considered holy and moving about unnecessarily, even to improve one's economic situation, was condemned. Modern capitalism originated in the cities of the Occident. Growth of Indian cities was for several reasons brought to a standstill. Citizens were numerically weak. Their acceptance of Buddhism and Jainism, both of which were extremely pacific, prevented the creation of military forces ca? pable of competing with the princes. The caste system made a city, in the sense of the Greek "Polis" or Occidental city, impossible. The princes, with the aid of the Brahmans, were able to defeat every civic move for power. The kings and conquerors also preserved the interests of the Brahmans which were distinctly in opposition to those of the citizens. There occurred no combination of forces, such as princes and citizens or citizens and kings. Only one class maintained its position during all stages of Indian history. It was that of the priests and literary class, known as the Brahmans, which has played the leading r?le in the development and perpetuation of the caste system and its seemingly unbreakable traditionalistic spirit. Economic conditions or social stratification give one no satisfying an? swer to the problem. It is rather the "spirit" which permeates and lies at the bottom of the entire system which demands attention. It is Weber's task to inform us what this spirit is and how it was created. To accomplish this he studies the religious and ethical ideas of Hinduism and Hindu sects. In his research he discovers that the Brahmans are the chief bearers and cultivators of these ideas. An understanding of this intellectual priestly class</page><page sequence="13">Business Ethic of World Religions 51 is indispensable for the comprehension of both social-economic conditions and religious-ethical forces. We shall direct our attention to the study of this class. It is a difficult task to present a clear picture of this religious move? ment, even if the numerous sects are left out of consideration. We shall attempt to present the fundamental lasting religious ideas essential to the understanding of the business ethic of the Hindu. Having done this, the deviating teachings of Buddhism and Jainism will be presented insomuch as they have influenced the business ethic. Hinduism is not a religion in the Occidental meaning of the term. It knows no code of dogmas. It could accept most of Christianity without nullifying its own point of view. A doctrine may be considered as "ortho? dox" and yet not be binding. Hinduism is both tolerant and accommodating. Most Hindus belong to a sect and worship their special deities. Even the ritual, which is so important to Hinduism, is not unified but varies according to the social status of the Hindu and undergoes change from time to time. Hinduism is a church in Weber's terminology because one is not converted to or accepted into this religion, but must be born of Hindu parentage to become a Hindu. One may join only as a member of a caste. The Veda, the holy book of the Hindus, is in reality only a prelude to Hinduism and gives one no idea of its content. The Veda does not rec? ognize the Hindu-Trinity. In fact there is practically nothing concerning man or God in it. It practically denounces the Dharma (ritual duties). The sanctity of the cow and the strict forbiddance to kill it receive no mention. Furthermore, the Veda is silent concerning the fundamental teachings of Hinduism: the Karma and metempsychosis. It knows a Hades and a Heaven and affirms life and its goods and blessings. It is oriented to the world. Why then is the acceptance of the Veda obligatory to the believing Hindu? For the reason that the acknowledgment of the Veda is synonymous with the acceptance of the social rank of its bearers, namely the Brahmans. The status of the Brahmans is implied in the Veda, thus giving them a tradi? tionalistic sanction for the position which they assumed in India about 1000 800 B.C.12 The Brahmans were originally magicians and bearers of the "cha? risma." They became an intellectual class, substituting knowledge for magic. In this Brahman caste one sees the embodiment and growth of Hindu thought which led from the primitive belief in gods and demons to a fear? less questioning of the very existence of God. Throughout Indian history the Brahmans have maintained their position as a class of priests, teachers, 12See H. Oldenberg. Buddha sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde, 5th Edition, Stuttgart, 1906.</page><page sequence="14">52 Bennion and advisors distinctly different from the Chinese mandarins or the proph? ets of Israel. Kings and princes not only accepted the social status of the Brahmans, but endowed them with lands and land rents. They did so be? cause the Brahmans gave the social order, including the material interests of the rulers, an unsurpassable religious sanction. The Brahmans have maintained their exalted position in relation to the great masses because they alone possess the knowledge and power necessary to satisfy the relig? ious needs of the Hindus. The Brahmans consider themselves as being dis? tinctly different and above the remaining Hindus. They were at times considered as gods by lower classes. In addition to being employed by the princes to sanction their interests, they were useful to them because of their learning and administrative ability. In India proper the Brahmans re? mained aloof from struggles for political power which helped them retain their important position and unique character. The influence of the Brahmans was due chiefly to the following fac? tors: (1) the religious ideas which they developed; (2) a very elaborate sys? tem of ritual imperative to the welfare of the Hindus which the Brahmans alone could understand and perform; (3) the caste system, the growth of which they influenced and the maintenance of which they assured through their religious ideas. The religious teachings of the Brahmans are not with? out contradiction and inconsistences. Two are, however, outstanding and have stood the test of time. One is the theory of metempsychosis, or the transmigration or reincarnation of souls; the second, that of Karma which affirms the law of retribution in its most extreme, irresistible form. Every ethical, relevant act influences the fate of the doer. This fate is neither heaven nor hell but rebirth. The Karma is inseparably united with the doc? trine of reincarnation. The good deeds and sins of a previous life have determined this life, as this life determines the fate of a future life on earth.13 These doctrines created the most logical theodicy for the existing social order, in this case the caste system, which has ever been produced. The Brahmans overcame the gods of mythology and finally developed the idea of a single, impersonal God, the All-in-Oneness to which matter or the evanescent world formed a counterpart, although it had originally emanated from it. The God of the Brahmans was not the Creator. Mankind was not the created standing in a personal relationship with its Creator. Grace played absolutely no part in Hindu thought. Although life was pre? determined, it did not result from the will of God but from the acts of the individual which were ruled by the law of compensation or retribution. 13Weber, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 119.</page><page sequence="15">Business Ethic of World Religions 53 Prayer or individual worship of any kind had no place in such a religion. There was no need for a Savior. It was not death which the Hindu feared but rebirth. No Savior or God could free him from that. Only his own deeds and the Brahman, as director of his ritual, could help him better his position at his next reincarnation. Hinduism, in contrast with Buddhism and Jainism, held fast to the idea of the existence of the soul. Hindu thought conceived the notion of self ("Atman") as the central power and essence of the individual. This it identified with the impersonal "Whole." Self was considered a part of the eternal "Whole." The fact that it was now excluded from it in an imperfect world accounted for pain and suf? fering. The ego craved union with the "All-in-Oneness." It oscillated be? tween this and the evanescent world. For our purposes, the religious dogmas of importance are the Karma and reincarnation. These were ac? cepted, not only by Hinduism, but also by Buddhism and Jainism. The Brahmans cultivated these religious ideas and developed, in ad? dition, a ritual, the Dharma, which became the most important part of the religious life of the masses. The contents of the Dharma originated from the magical norms of the magical practice of past ages. Thus they are based on holy tradition. Ideas of salvation and doctrines may change but the Dharma remains eternal. Each caste has its particular ritual duties. They may be developed or specialized through division of castes, but they main? tain their permanent character in the mind of the Hindu. Not what do you believe, but what is your Dharma is the all important question. Transgres? sion of the Dharma is synonymous with expulsion from Hinduism. Since the Brahmans alone directed the ritual they were able to mo? nopolize and control, to a great extent, Hindu worship. Weber contends that they contributed more than any other groups or factors to the devel? opment and maintenance of the caste system. When the Aryans first in? vaded India they found a black, primitive, degenerate race. Although there was some intermarriage, a great deal of class distinction resulted which was further developed by many other races which invaded India. These racial factors were important in the formation of the castes. However, regardless of their origin, a disputable question among authorities, the system was nourished and perpetuated by the Brahmans in the interest of their own social status and material position. It was the ritual which created the cleft between castes and it was the Karma and the belief in reincarnation which prevented an ultimate break with an "eternal" system. Every noticeable impulse to revolt came from the higher, intellectual classes and not from the vast majority of Hindus who were reconciled to the eternally revolving wheel of reincarnation. The caste system prevented any development analogous to the for? mation of Occidental cities with their fight for legal and political power</page><page sequence="16">54 Bennion which was so essential to the rise of industrial capitalism. The ritualistic barriers, the "untouchableness" of twenty-five per cent of the Hindus, and the inheritance of the caste prevented any civic association for the simple reason that all "commercium" was out of the question. The seclusion of the castes from one another was not only social and professional, as the guilds of the Occident, but also deeply religious and magically founded. The theory of natural rights could never have developed on Indian soil. Every kind of social ethic was unthinkable. The idea of personality, so strong in an individualistic society, played no positive r?le in Hindu thought. Inherent individual rights did not exist. The conception of state with its accompanying theories of political ethics never took root in the mind of the Hindu. Hinduism did not develop a unified or systematic ethic. The divergent duties belonging to the caste ritual gave direction to practical ethics. Al? though Hinduism produced no real ethic, it did influence tremendously the manner of life of the Hindus, and this determined, within given limits of course, the economic and social development. How did Hinduism impede the growth of the spirit of modern capitalism? Indian religiousness represents the oldest and strongest form of world-negation which the world has even known. It stands out in sharp contrast with Confucianism on the one hand, and is distinctly different from Puritanism on the other. The Hindu's desire for rest and freedom from pain cannot be satisfied in or through the world. The All-in-Oneness is separated from the world. The only way to obtain union with it is to flee from the world. The Hindu does not aim to overcome or remodel the world, as does the Puritan, but to escape the world. Weber states that Hindu philosophy and theology are ". . . metaphysically, cosmologically founded skilled teachings of the technical means of becoming free from the world."14 What were these technical means? The Dharma was more a means of bettering one's chances at rebirth than an escape from the world. The necessity of remaining in a rejected world naturally led to asceticism. Hindu asceticism, in contrast with the innerworldly asceticism of Puritanism, was otherworldly and contemplative. Hindu asceticism did not serve the purpose of gaining strength in the strug? gle against temptation and sin. It did not serve the strong individual in his challenging effort to overcome. The whole purpose of it was to escape the Karma causality and rebirth. The essence of Hindu conduct was to lose all interest in the world, to refrain from worldly activity of every kind, to strip oneself of every craving, passion, feeling, and mundane interest. Contem 14Ibid., p. 147.</page><page sequence="17">Business Ethic of World Religions 55 plation, inactivity, languidness, a state of insensibility were the means of escape from the transitoriness of the world. Not only were sensual pleasures and "sinful" passions condemned but also positive virtues and "righteous" desires such as love of man, of nature, and the good things of life. A state of apathy bordering on unconsciousness as far as the world and its contents were concerned, was the goal of Hindu contemplative asceticism. Naturally the great majority of Hindus did not attain nor attempt to achieve this ultimate goal. It remained, however, the ideal and path of salvation. It degraded activity in the world and stigmatized it as being lowly. Otherworldly asceticism and contemplation are irrational means of obtaining the goods of salvation. They could lead to no practical, rational, methodical living in economic life. They were, furthermore, "ausseralltaeg lich" and aloof from every-day life in contrast with Puritan asceticism. The struggle for salvation was limited to a very small proportion of the popu? lation, even if one includes the "sects of salvation" which formed only about five per cent of the Hindu population. The vast majority remained bound to the wheel of reincarnation. Weber writes: No Hindu would have perceived his devotion to and success in an economic calling, as a proof of grace. What is more important, no Hindu would have undertaken the rational remodeling of the world according to substantive principles, at the same time considering his efforts as the execution of the will of God.15 The religious anthropolatry of the Hindu laymen toward the naturally strong traditionalistic and "charismatic" guru impeded any practical ra? tional manner of life. Where the accumulation of wealth was considerable, its application was irrational in an economic sense. JAINISM AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM Jainism16 is especially interesting because it is a sect of a commercial class. It originated about the seventh century B. C. and had, during the time it flourished, 300-1300 A. D., a far-reaching influence in India. Re? jecting the Veda, the Brahmanistic ritual, and the supreme All-in-Oneness, it was branded as heresy by the Brahmans whose existence it threatened. Jainism taught that all souls, and not a supreme, absolute spirit, were the bearers of life. These souls are a sort of monad, an active principle, capable of unlimited knowledge. They are distinctly above and in contrast with mat 15Ibid., p. 360. 16See Ibid., pp. 202-217.</page><page sequence="18">56 Bennion ter which is the source of evil and pain. Jains sought freedom not from existence as did the Buddhists but from the body. Knowledge, mediation, and extreme asceticism are the means of at? taining the "Nirvana." "He who hungers himself to death, attains the high? est degree of holiness."17 Cessation of action, hoping and wishing, a complete renunciation of the world were the path of salvation. Jainism cul? tivated magic more than Hinduism or Buddhism. Jainism developed an order of wandering, begging monks whose life represented the most extreme form of asceticism the world has ever known. Commerce and business were forbidden the monks. Wandering and sepa? ration from the household were demanded of them. It would have been impossible for all Jains to exist as monks. Somewhat less strict in its ritual and asceticism was the manner of life required from the lay Jains. In ad? dition to the Hindu rules, which they accepted, a strict ascetic life was pre? scribed analogous to that of the Puritan. Business was not forbidden but the possession of wealth was limited. Pleasure and luxurious living of every kind were tabu. Their asceticism, as a matter of fact, encouraged their eco? nomic growth. The fact that the Jains were and are chiefly merchants is explained by their ritual. Even as the monks, the laymen were absolutely forbidden to kill. This law made it impossible for them to engage in nu? merous vocations. Trade was the natural outlet for their activities. Strict rules of honesty and truthfulness closed the doors of numerous profitable trades in India. Although the Jains developed commercial capitalism, Occidental in? dustrial capitalism remained undeveloped due to the traditionalistic spirit, exclusion from profitable industries, and their unsuccessfulness in breaking the bonds of the caste system. The unsatisfied craving for ritual on the part of the strongly organized laymen, combined with the fact that the monks refused to occupy themselves with the temple service, led to the employment of the Brahmans for such purposes. The restoration of the Brahmans was made possible by the indefinite character of the ritual and worship of the laymen. Even the caste system, although threatened, was not broken. BUDDHISM AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM Buddhism demands attention because of its great proselyting power outside of India and its dwindling importance in the life of the Hindu him? self. Buddhism is a second great religion of salvation born in India, Jainism 17Ibid., p. 206.</page><page sequence="19">Business Ethic of World Religions 57 being the first. Buddhism accepts the fundamental doctrines of Hinduism: Karma and reincarnation. It was freedom from the power of the latter prin? ciple which Buddha sought. He found it to his own satisfaction. All exist? ence is painful. Birth, sickness, old age, and death are painful. The cause of this pain is the craving or thirst for existence or non-existence. The ces? sation of pain would mean salvation. It could only be obtained by achieving the cessation of all craving. Buddha's "Nirvana" was not eternal life but release from existence. That was possible by adopting a manner of life which would release one from all craving for life and the world. Buddhism rejects the same parts of Brahmanism as does Jainism. It also rejects the concept of self. Self is not a metaphysical unity but a bundle of perceptions, feelings, and passions. Salvation is solely the act of the in? dividual. God, prayer, grace, and predestination play no part in the attain? ment of salvation. What type of conduct did the intellectual, schooled, wandering monk adopt? Buddha rejected both self-torture and sensual pleasures. Passions, even every desire to live, were obstructions to salvation. Ignorance, sensuality, and the evil will, that is, the will to live, were the cardinal sins to be overcome. This could best be achieved by the meditative contemplation of truth. Here, as before, the excessive passion to do good, as well as the will to do evil, were both rejected. Love and sympathy were to remain impersonal, neutral. The begging life of the monk was not characterized by ascetic liv? ing. Mundane activities of all kinds were renounced. There was absolutely no chance of the Buddhistic manner of life producing economic rationalism. Buddhism prescribed a definite order of life and in this sense the Buddhis? tic life was rational. Economically speaking, however, such a life was, both as to means and purpose, irrational. The ethic was non-social. There were no social problems in Bud? dhism. Buddha repudiated the caste system but since it had not been firmly established in those sections where Buddhism was born, it presented no problem to Buddha. In spite of the fact that the concept of personality was denied by Buddha, his ethic was for the individual. Each individual must save himself?free himself from his bundle of perceptions and desires. There was no place for social ethics. Charity toward the wandering monks was recommended to the laymen. This was instigated more for the temporal salvation of the monks than for ethical reasons. The life of the monk could not be lived by all Hindus. Laymen were accepted into Buddhism on a far less stringent basis than the monks. They simply confessed their allegiance to Buddha, the teachings, and the branch. Buddhism developed no hierarchy of officials. The organization of religious groups remained loose. There was no prescribed, methodical plan of living. No control was exercised over the moral or economic life of the laymen.</page><page sequence="20">58 Bennion No promise of religious reward for economic conduct was proffered by Buddhism. In fact Buddhistic influence on the economic life of the laymen was negative. Every incentive to action failed. The life of the monk, free from every connection with both heaven and earth, was the exalted ideal? the path of salvation. The mundane life of the laymen was necessarily im? perfect and unsatisfying. It was the concession of a lower standard of living and was recognized as being lower and subordinate to the life of the monk. Due to its lax organization and lack of control over the laymen, Bud? dhism declined rapidly in India. Brahmanistic ritual satisfied the religious needs of the laymen more fully and was thus able to triumph over Bud? dhism. The caste system remained unbroken in Hindustan. Even the con? quering Mohammedans failed to abolish the castes and were beset by this system themselves. JAPAN AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM Of interest to our problem is the inception of Mahyana-Buddhism in Japan.18 It was introduced by the rulers of Japan for the purposes of do? mesticating and disciplining their subjects. Buddhism brought about little change in the religious and social life of the Japanese in spite of the fact that it was generally accepted. It achieved a relative, rational, religious or? der of life, introduced otherworldly means and aims of salvation, and brought about an enrichment of the emotional content of life. Buddhism, in turn, accommodated itself to Japanese religious life. The manner of life of the Japanese, in contrast with that of the Hindu and Chinese, was not determined by religious forces, writes Weber, "but by the feudal character of the political and social structure."19 The feudal lords created and supported political offices to overcome the social order of the clan ("Geschlechterstaat") which had existed in Japan. Feudalism was the ruling power in Japan throughout the Middle Ages. It impeded foreign commerce and prevented the development of the city with its ac? companying "bourgeosie" and legal rights. Not only business men and tradesmen but the greater part of the farmers were without legal protection. Political capitalism did not appear because there was no separation of the soldier or warrior from the means of warfare. No rational war originated because an institution of state purveyors and a class of state creditors did not exist. Social and political structure and organization prevented the rise of capitalism independent of Western civilization. 18See Ibid., pp. 295-298. 19See Ibid., p. 296.</page><page sequence="21">Business Ethic of World Religions 59 The interesting question arises, why did Japan accept Western capi? talism so freely and adapt herself to it so rapidly? There was, in the first place, no literary class as bearers of traditionalism comparable to that in China. The strongest social class in Japan was a professional military class. A class which, of its own accord, would not have developed a rational busi? ness ethic. The ruling class in Japan prevented the development of a guru class in Buddhism which might have had far-reaching power and influence over the conduct of the masses, as did the Brahmans in India. Although Japanese religious life incorporated a ritual of the knighthood class, func? tional gods and demons in the service of worldly interests, and the ancestor ("Ahnengeister") cult, the absence of the guru or mandarin as a social and traditional power paved the way for the rapid rise of Western capitalism. The break with traditionalism was not a struggle with traditionalism based on the intellectual and "charismatic" power of the leading classes, but an adjustment with the social and economic structure based chiefly on political power. In Japan a business ethic founded on religious ideas was not strong enough to impede the growth of capitalism. Its very weakness cleared the way for the economic order of the Occident. ANCIENT JUDAISM AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM Weber considers Judaism to be equally as important in the cultural history of mankind as the development of Greek thought, Roman law and the Roman Church, the feudal ("staendische") order of the Middle Ages, and Protestantism. Without Judaism both Christianity and Mohammedan? ism are unthinkable. Had not Paul saved the Old Testament, Christianity would have remained a pneumatic-sect and mystical community on Hellenic ground. As it was, the incorporation of the Old Testament made possible the Church with its theodicy of suffering and Christian ethic of every-day life. The fact that Paul rejected all elements of the traditionalistic ethic that were incompatible with Christ's teachings and which stamped the sin? gular position of the Jews as a "pariah" people anchored in ritual paved the way for the universality of the Church, strengthening at the same time the distinctive character of Judaism. Judaism was also the expressed stimu? lant and prototype for the message of Mohammed. The great historical significance of Judaism lies in the influence of its ethic on the ethic of Europe and the Near East. This influence is ascertainable only if we preface this discussion with a brief presentation of the political position and social stratification of Is? rael and the religious foundations of the Hebrew ethic. The early history of Israel is very problematical. One senses this fact in Weber's procedure</page><page sequence="22">60 Bennion and conclusions. The uncertain character of some of his conclusions is com? pensated for by his very illuminating, suggestive insight into the social, eco? nomic, and religious life of the Jews. Sociologically, the Jews became a "pariah" people. Their Ghetto ex? istence and dualistic ethic can be explained from this fact. The Assyrian Palestinian mountainous country has been interchangeably under Egyptian and Mesopotamian influence. Palestine was under Egyptian rule from the eighteenth dynasty to the end of the Rameses. After which it was first under Assyrian rule in the ninth century, Babylonian in the seventh, and then under Persian, Greek, Roman, and Mohammedan rule, respectively. From the thirteenth century to the ninth century B. C. only was this territory free to develop its political structure independently. These countries influ? enced Palestine greatly. However, Egypt influenced Palestine comparatively little considering the length of her rule and the extent of her power. These external forces gave the inhabitants of Palestine a realization of their sin? gular, precarious position. Within the country geographical conditions produced a social strati? fication which strengthened the covenant-forming tendency of the Jews. The entire history of Palestine down to the Kingdom of Judah is a history of struggle between the inhabitants living in the mountains and the hills and those on the plains. The latter were composed of city patriciate and later tenant farmers, the former of Bedouins and semi-nomadic shepherds. The border line between the city dwellers and the tenant farmers, as well as that between the Bedouins and the shepherds, was in a state of fluc? tuation. The cities of old Israel were founded by the economically capable war clans imbued with inherited "charisma" very similar to the cities of early Greece and the early part of the Middle Ages. The life of the shep? herds was more stable than that of the Bedouins because they were com? pelled to seek a very definite change of pasturage for their flocks. The contrasting interests of these classes intensified, Weber maintains, the for? mation of brotherhoods, tribes, and cities based on the clan ("Geschlechter staedte"). The general evolution of classes in Palestine may be traced from Bedouins to shepherds, then to domiciled farmers, and finally to city dwell? ers. These groups were originally all armed for battle, each possessing its own means of warfare and uniting with each other as their interests dic? tated. Under David, Israel became a city-kingdom. The military power of the shepherds was broken and the powerful patriciate became the bearers of arms. The shepherds became day laborers and joined the ranks of the poorer classes. From this time on and, what is most important from our point of view, during the era of the prophets there were two important</page><page sequence="23">Business Ethic of World Religions 61 classes in direct opposition to each other. These were the rich, creditor patricians and the poor, debtor farmers and laborers. The collections of legal norms in Israel give evidence of this antago? nism between the debtor farmers and city creditors. They testify further to the extended commercial traffic which traversed Palestine. The norms regu? lating the activities and protection of farmers were especially numerous. The influence of Babylonian law is clearly discernible in the content of Hebrew law. However, in a very important phase of Jewish law, Babylonian influence is entirely lacking. It knows nothing of the distinction made by the dualistic ethic characteristic of the law of Israel. This distinction, Weber writes "was taken over primarily from the old brotherhood ethic of neigh? boring clans with their duty to render gratuitous assistance in time of need."20 It originated, furthermore, not from the exigencies of legal practice but from a religious commandment. Religious forces were not only the source of important legal norms, but the entire legal history of Israel reveals an increasing theologizing of the law. Characteristic of the Hebrew conception of religion, ethics, and law is the principle of the covenant between Yahveh and His chosen people. Weber thinks that the covenant-forming period between Yahveh and Israel was preceded by the founding of religious orders such as that of the Rechabites and probably the tribe of Judah. Such orders verified them? selves as the means of stabilizing the otherwise labile clans of Bedouins and semi-nomads. The order of the Rechabites, which has existed down to modern times, is a striking example of this type of organization. A later and classic species of political organization founded on a religious order is Mohammedanism. The true origin of the "berith" concept seems highly hypothetical among historians and in Weber's own writings. For our purposes it is of less importance. It is of greater interest to follow Weber in his ascertain? ment of its perpetuation and influence. No doubt, the formation of the powerful political tribe of Judah was based on the special covenant of the Jews with Yahveh. "The formation of the pure Yahveh cult under Joash and the acceptance of the Deuteronomy law under Josiah came to pass by virtue of the covenant."21 Regardless of the origin or age of the covenant, it was accepted and taught by the Levitic "thora" and became the founda? tion of Hebrew ethic and law. The priests and prophets identified the God of the Jews with the God of the patriarchs. What is Weber's description of the Hebrew conception of Yahveh? Yahveh was highly anthropomorphic, a superman with body and passions. 20Ibid., Vol. Ill, p. 69. 211Ibid., Vol. Ill, p. 86.</page><page sequence="24">62 Bennion In old Israel He was not the universal God of an eternal order, but the most powerful of gods?the God of Israel. In this capacity He was a war god, a God of catastrophe, capable of performing wonders. Moreover, He was a God of salvation and promise not in relation to the soul but in regard to the immediate political future. In contrast with Hindu and Chinese dei? ties He was a God of history with a past record and a future plan. He was holy and remote. He spoke to His servants, the prophets, through visions, dreams, messengers, and with the greatest "face to face." In what relation? ship did Yahveh stand to Israel? Weber states: His own vow and absolutely nothing else (Deut. 7:7) induced Yahveh to favor Israel above all other peoples. It was not perchance because Israel was of higher moral worth.22 The only answer to the question, why Yahveh had not perchance cho? sen other peoples, was that they did or did not do certain things which Israel performed. Israel was obligated to worship Yahveh and to keep His name holy and, above all, to keep His commandments which the other nations did not do. There was likewise but one explanation for the decay or destruction of Israel?the breaking of the covenant expressed in the transgression of the law. The whole Jewish ethic rested on these two closely related principles: obedience toward God and unflinching faith in His power. These principles permeating the Levitic "thora" were equally well supported by the prophets. The concept of the covenant and the notion that destruction resulted in the breaking of the covenant were known to no other peoples. In Israel one finds the very powerful and singular relationship be? tween God and man to the exclusion of all other intimacies. True enough, Israel was not always conscious of the covenant, but occasional relapses only served the prophets with ammunition to renew the fight for the cove? nant. The very aloofness, and yet personal wonder-performing character of Yahveh, made possible the institution of the prophets of Israel. The ab? sence of a bureaucratic class similar to the mandarins, and due to the fact that the politically powerful kings and war lords were, as a rule, devoid of priestly power and honor, assured the perpetuation and power of the prophets. We have already pointed out the impossible existence of prophets in China. The prophets of India, Buddha for example, Weber calls "exem? plary" prophets. They were not the intermediaries nor the mouthpiece of God, but were solely the representatives of the exemplary life which leads to the "Nirvana." Weber calls Israel's prophets emissary prophets. They were sent by Yahveh on a definite mission with a trenchant message and they spoke in the name of the Lord. The hazardous political situation and 22Ibid., p. 128.</page><page sequence="25">Business Ethic of World Religions 63 the inner economic and social structure furnished them substance for prophecy and assured them recognition. In critical periods kings called them in for consultation; in times of peace and prosperity their popularity among the masses, whom they defended, prevented their extermination by those in power. The prophets did not establish the covenant and the laws. That was the work of the priests. The prophets presupposed the acceptance and knowledge of the covenant in Israel and used them as the basis of their prophecy. The prophets served only to strengthen the law and the covenant. Offering sacrifices was abominable and mockery unless accompanied by obedience to the "berith".23 The great contribution of the Israelitish em issary-prophethood was the elimination of all magic from the world, thus clearing the way for the modern, rational, technical economy. The Hebrew ethic propounded by the prophets was rational. Magicians, astrologers, witches, and the like were of the devil. There was only one path of salva? tion?obedience. Moreover, the six hundred and thirteen commandments of Moses, plus the many more precepts added by the priests, gave the Jews a very definite set of laws to obey. Although the threats of the prophets of Yahveh's intervention in the world order may have been irrational, they motivated rational conduct. Exemplary-prophethood, as that in India, naturally leads to contem? plation and mysticism. The emissary prophets of Israel gave no encourage? ment to contemplation. The prophets themselves were not contemplative nor exemplary, even in their own eyes. They represented a positive order based on action that promised salvation to the temporal kingdom of Israel. The fact that Yahveh was wifeless and childless prevented the creation of a mythology.24 Both Egyptian and Babylonian religions failed to penetrate the relig? ion of the Hebrews. The astrologie determinism of Babylon was well un? derstood and decidedly rejected by the Jews. The Egyptian religiousness, though highly rational, left a loophole which destroyed its force in ethical conduct. This loophole was the magical power of the "scarab" to belie the sins of the dead before the judge of the dead.25 Both Egyptian and Baby? lonian religiousness were characterized by magic which prevented the birth of rational methodical conduct. The "Levitic" priests prevented any "contamination" of the Hebrew ethic by Egyptian or Babylonian religiousness. Of what importance would the Levitic priests be if one could conceal one's sins and dupe the judge 23See I Samuel, 15:22 and Isaiah, 1:11-17 for illustrations of this point. 24Weber, Gesammelte Aufsaetze zur Religionssoziologie, Vol. Ill, p. 148. 25Ibid., p. 279.</page><page sequence="26">64 Bennion of the dead? Or how could they perpetuate the covenant and their own functions under the influence of astrologie determinism? Weber gives Moses probable credit for implanting the Yahveh conception and assuring the position of the priests in Israel. However, the priests gave the Hebrew ethic its material content and played an increasingly important r?le in Judah. After Malachi they even stamped out the institution of the prophets. This "coup d'?tat" was accomplished under Persian rule. The close of the period of the prophets of destruction was marked by a gracious turn of Yahveh as evidenced in the promise of salvation. The idea of a Savior or Messiah assumed different forms with the various proph? ets. The dominating view accepted the belief in a new, temporal king who would liberate Judah from her oppressors. This day of salvation was near at hand. Times were critical for the individual Hebrew. He needed to know how to prepare himself for that day. The Levitic priests possessed this knowledge. Their knowledge was quite limited to Yahveh's commandments and the accompanying ritual. That was, however, all important because "knowledge is greater than faith." These Levitic savants dampened all possible ardor for mythological development. They wrote the history of creation in short, concise words. Doctrines smacking of mysticism, such as Adam's transgression, were sup? pressed. The priests and Talmud taught no original sin. The offerings and ritual were rationalized. Questions were required to be clear and pointed that they might be answered with "aye, aye" or "nay, nay." The priests profaned the offering and the feasts of offering. They took away the authority of the clan chiefs to preside over offerings and sacred f?tes of the clan, thus robbing them of their "charismatic" character which they maintained in China and some extent in India. The institutions of the death and ancestor cults had previously been undermined by the very na? ture of Yahvism. The dissolving of the clan as a religious or magical unit was a great move in the direction of the rationalization of conduct. The Yahveh conception of the priests was similar to that of the proph? ets as far as ethical consequences were concerned. Yahveh was a God of righteous reward and just punishment. He was a God of the plebeian. The priests tended to render Yahveh more impersonal and to lay less stress on his anthropomorphic qualities than the prophets had done. Their relation? ship to Him was purely ethical. It was based on knowledge and was less emotional than that of the prophet spokesmen. Many factors connected with the Jewish religion and ethic were fa? vorable to the growth of the spirit analogous to that of modern capitalism. The most important factor was the elimination of magic from the world. Conduct was placed on an ethical basis between God and man. Reward and punishment and material well being depended on obedience to a posi</page><page sequence="27">Business Ethic of World Religions 65 tive set of legal and ethical norms. Contemplation and mysticism were re? duced to a minimum. Ceremonies and rituals were highly rational. This rational ethic was not accepted by the intellectual class only, as was the case in India, but was understood and adhered to by the great majority of the Jews. There was, generally speaking, only one ethic for all Jews. The priests and prophets, though feared and respected, were not subjects of hagiolatry. It was this rational "ethos" of the Hebrew ethic, founded on religion, that bestowed upon it its individuality and accounted for its influ? ence on the conduct and everyday life of the Jews. The ethical norms, as such, are not unlike those contained in the Egyptian Book of the Dead. In spite of these favorable ethical stipulations, the Jews did not de? velop industrial capitalism. Weber writes: In any case, those Oriental, southern-European, and eastern-European territories in which the Jews lived longest and felt most at home have not developed either in Antiauity, the Middle Ages, or modern times, the specific characteristics of capi? talism.2* The particular contribution of the Jews to the actual economic evo? lution of the Occident resulted from their "pariah" character. This caste? like character in a surrounding non-caste world was all important for the economic development of the Jews. It was founded on the Deuteronomy law, strengthened during the Exile, completed by Ezra and Nehemiah, and preserved by priests and rabbis. Israel, which had previously been primarily a political association, became a Jewish confessional "communion." During this confessional period ethical maxims and religious rituals became more strict and exacting. Religious communities were organized with Jerusalem as the center. These became thereafter the bearers of the "spirit." The ethic, thus bolstered, permeated the communities and developed the caste? like character of their members. Marriage with outsiders was forbidden, and "commercium" as guests of non-brothers was prohibited. Keeping the Sabbath holy received a fresh impetus which led to the boycotting of market goods on the Sabbath. The Jewish Sabbath, Sabbath year, tithes, taxes for the upkeep of the Temple, donations to the rabbis and priests, and the offering of the best of the flock directed much capital into economically non-productive chan? nels. Certain trades and vocations were incompatible with the Hebrew ethic and hence virtually forbidden to the orthodox Jew, above all, agri? culture and those occupations dependent on it such as tanning, wool-card? ing, camel and donkey herding. In addition, the making of pottery, 26Ibid., p. 360.</page><page sequence="28">66 Bennion freighting by land and sea, fortune telling, and numerous other vocations came under the tabu. The Jews became necessarily attached to the city. The natural outlets for their economic activity were commerce and finance. The dualistic ethic of the Jews gave them a unique position in the world of finance. No ethical or religious commandments prohibited their taking usury from the non-Jew. The Christians were, on the contrary, forbidden the practice of usury throughout the Middle Ages. The world needed capital then as now and the Jews profited from this combination of circumstances. Commerce and finance comprised chiefly the Jewish economic enterprise from the last cen? turies before Christ until after the birth of modern capitalism under the influence of ascetic Protestantism. The Jews as industrial "entrepreneurs" belong to our age and not to the beginnings of capitalism. Jewish partici? pation in matters of state has been greatly restricted during the past two thousand years. This fact has also served to direct their energies into com? mercial and financial affairs. The elimination of magic from the world was alone not sufficient to produce industrial capitalism. The Jewish ethic and manner of living re? mained traditionalistic. The miserable plight of the Jews brought about no great change of tradition because the prophets of the Exile period brought forward a theodicy of suffering which served to strengthen traditional be? liefs and to glorify their "pariah" situation. The expected coming of the sinless servant of God to be martyred for the sins of the world, especially clearly expressed in Isaiah, chapter 53, lay at the foundation of this theodicy. Weber cannot resist rendering a personal judgment of value when he designates this conception "as the specific, most miserable ethic of non resistance."27 Finally, the Jewish ethic gave no appreciable religious sanc? tion to economic activity as such. The all important concept of a calling was not felt in Jewish every-day life. It was, however, this very concept of a calling, according to Weber, which revolutionized the economic order. This study of Weber's sociology of religion illustrates his approach to historical problems. It is a study of the influence of human behavior and above all, of group conduct on the economic and social order. (In one sense it is the antithesis to historical materialism presented however, only as one possible and limited, not as a total or dogmatic explanation of his? torical reality). The particular problem under discussion illustrates Weber's usage of the development of a definite type of rationalism as a compass in the vast sea of historical reality.) 27Ibid., p. 392. The Christian ethic of non-resistance was not compatible with Weber's ethic of responsibility. On this point he was, no doubt, influenced by Nietzsche.</page><page sequence="29">Business Ethic of World Religions 67 The spirit of modern capitalism serves him as an ideal type by which he estimates and measures that spirit or lack of spirit in the great religious movements of the past. We found the rational elements of this ideal type wanting in China and India. Religious ideas and rituals based on magic and traditionalism prevented their growth. The Hebrews paved the way for the spirit of modern capitalism by eliminating magic and the "charisma", but they remained anchored in traditionalism based, to a great extent, on the ethic of Yahvism. The nearest approach to the ideal type we found in the rational, practical, methodical life of the Protestant ascetics. In each case Weber discovered religious motives at the bottom of economic action or inaction. MORMONISM: A STUDY OF THE INTERPLAY OF RELIGIOUS AND ECONOMIC FORCES The totality of Weber's research has, without doubt, demonstrated the inadequacy of materialism as "the" historical method. In conclusion, we wish to refer to the more recent religious movement of Mormonism28 which illustrates the problem. Weber refers to it only in a footnote29 and Troeltsch not at all. Mormonism was founded in the state of New York in 1830 after "bourgeois" capitalism and the "economic virtues" had been firmly established in Wester civilization. The fact that the Mormons were driven out of New York, Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and finally to the Rocky Mountains, kept them in comparative isolation in their early development. Moreover, the adherents to Mormonism, coming chiefly from the United States of America, Canada, England, and the Protestant countries of Europe were brought together in an entirely new economic and social en? vironment. The recentness of this isolated movement makes its true history more ascertainable and reduces the complexity of many problems in ques? tion. Both religious fervor and economic activity have been very intense in Mormon development. These facts make Mormonism an ideal field for the study of the interplay of religious and economic forces in the growth of a new and unique civilization. An economic history or a comprehensive sociology of Mormonism is yet to be written. Here we can only suggest certain relations between re? ligious ideas and economic forces. The history of Mormonism substantiates 28Mormonism was originally a nickname given the Church by adversaries. The correct name is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. 29Weber, The Protestant Ethic, p. 264, note 25.</page><page sequence="30">68 Bennion Weber's thesis that religious ideas give, especially in the beginning, a di? rective and original impetus to economic and social development. No one has attempted as yet to explain the origin of Mormonism as the ideological superstructure of the factors of production, or as being mo? tivated by the economic interest of its founder, Joseph Smith. Any such attempt would appear far-fetched. Nor was Joseph Smith the mere expres? sion of a religious or an intellectual conflict within a religious group. He first appears as an uneducated youth without religious connections, un? versed in church history or religious dogma, philosophy or science. The boy prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah as the youthful prophets of ancient Israel had done before him. Thus two thousand years after the Jewish prophets had been silenced, three centuries after the Reformation, and at a time when the Calvinists and the Independent sects had spent much of their strength, Mormon prophets once more undertook to convert and reform the world. They were emissary prophets with a very definite, positive message which they claimed to have received through divine reve? lation. They considered themselves as tools in the hand of God who had called them to perform a definite task. They felt responsible to Him alone. Although these prophets claimed to have seen God and heavenly messengers and to have been in communion with them, they were in no wise vessels of the spirit in the sense that the Hindu prophets were. Their lives were lives of strenuous activity in material as well as in spiritual affairs. The Mormons, led by their prophets, were sent to call not one nation, but the whole world to repentance. They were to gather the faithful to a prom? ised land?America. Here Zion, the New Jerusalem, was to be built in the expectation of the immediate advent of the second coming of Christ. In Mormonism one finds the essential components of the combined spirit (not the same doctrine) of Judaism and Puritanism. The Mormons have exhibited the same trust in the God of Israel, have sealed covenants just as firmly, and promised obedience just as devoutly as the Israelites of old. Their mission is not to conquer the world by force, but by the power of the Gospel of Christ. They await, however, the personal appearance of Christ on earth when he will accept their efforts and reign on earth with the faithful. Their God is a personal being who created man in His own image. Man is dualistic, made up of body and spirit which are two forms of matter. God is the Father of the spirit. Thus man is an offspring of God endowed with the possibility of becoming like Him. The individual is con? ceived as being an eternal personality. Perhaps in no religion is the future, personal existence of man so emphatically proclaimed as in Mormonism. Man will not only be saved and be relieved from mundane trials, but may be creatively active throughout eternity. The present relationship between</page><page sequence="31">Business Ethic of World Religions 69 God and man is largely an ethical one. "Obedience is better than sacrifice" holds true in the Mormon ethic. Mormonism has no place for a philosophy of religion such as that of St. Augustine or of Thomas Aquinas because the Mormons claim their re? ligion to be the revealed word, the positive degree of a personal God ut? tered through His prophets. It is the very nature of a positive religion to be dogmatic. Thus in this respect the Mormon message resembles that of the Israelitish prophets. Non-Mormons frequently interpret Mormonism as a combination of certain teachings of Christ and those of ancient Judaism. They view the movement as being in a youthful, unphilosophical stage. This view coincides quite well with the Mormon standpoint which sees in Chris? tianity the culmination and fulfillment of Judaism, and in Mormonism the restoration of the primitive Christian Church. Thus Mormonism professes to have all the religious truths contained in both ancient Judaism and early Christianity. Essential to the understanding of the Mormon ethic is this covenant forming spirit, this chosen people idea analogous to that of an? cient Israel. There are, of course, many important distinctions between Mormon? ism and ancient Judaism. The most important one for our study is that the practical Mormon ethic is decidedly nontraditional in spite of the tradi? tional religious beliefs of the Mormons. They welcome material progress and have always been free in undertaking new and varied callings. In this respect their ethic resembles that of the Puritans, though motivated by dif? ferent beliefs. They have worked for the glory of God in the belief that His glory would be manifested shortly. There is little room for mysticism or the inactive, contemplative life in the Mormon ethic as the following passage from a standard Church work indicates: Whatsoever principle of intelligence we attain to in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection, and if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his "diligence" and "obedience*' than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come. There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of the world, upon which all blessings are predicated?and when we obtain any blessing from God it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.30 The Mormons have been exhorted to industry from the very beginning of their history. Thou shalt not idle awaythy time, . . . neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known.31 Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean . . . cease to sleep longer than is needful; 30Doctrine and Covenants, Section 130: 18-21 (given in 1843). 31Ibid., Section 60: 13 (given in 1832).</page><page sequence="32">70 Bennion retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.32 As early as 1833 in the midst of religious persecution and the trials of pioneer life, a "Word of Wisdom" was issued pertaining to the temporal welfare of the Church members.33 In this revelation alcoholic beverages, stimulating drinks, tobacco, and the eating of much meat are condemned as being unhealthful. Luxurious living is likewise discouraged. It is impos? sible to ascertain exactly the influence of these elements of ascetic living on Mormon economic development, however, it is beyond question that it has been considerable.34 The fight against evil and sin is particularly intensified in the life of the orthodox Mormon because of the Mormon conception of grace. Mormons recognize, as the Jews, no original sin. Adam's transgression was, according to Mormon belief, a necessary, foreseen means of bringing mortality into the world. The atonement of Christ compensates for Adam's transgression and makes it possible for man to be resurrected unto eternal life. Man is not responsible for Adam's fall nor Christ's atonement. Man is responsible only for his own sins. These were also atoned for by Christ. However, forgiveness is predicated on the individual's acceptance of and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Christ has accomplished his vicarious atoning work. It is now incumbent upon each individual to take advantage of the grace of God by repenting of personal sins and obeying the laws of the Gospel in the interest of receiving forgiveness and exaltation. In Weber's and Troeltsch's terminology Mormonism is also a sect,35 as was Calvinism, in contrast with Catholicism and Lutheranism. No com? promises were made with other churches or with political powers to gain universal recognition. One must believe, repent, and prove one's worth be? fore one is accepted into the fold. Moreover, after conversion the Mormon is expected to continue to lead a worthy life. Excommunication is enforced upon the unrepentant sinner. It is clear that the Mormon ethic based on religious conviction em? bodies the essential elements of the methodical, rational manner of every? day life indispensable to the spirit of modern capitalism. History has recorded the remarkable achievements of the Mormons in economic un? dertakings. Social, economic, psychological, as well as religious forces, have greatly influenced this development. Professor Ericksen36 explains the first 32Ibid., Section 88:124 (given in 1832). 33Ibid., Section 89 (given in 1833). 34See Harris and Butt, The Fruits of Mormonism, MacMillan and Co., 1926. 35See page 77 for Weber's definition of a sect. 36E. E. Ericksen, The Psychological and Ethical Aspects of Mormon Group Life, Chicago, 1922.</page><page sequence="33">Business Ethic of World Religions 71 stage of Mormon development (1830-1847) as a maladjustment between Mormons and non-Mormons which produced and shaped the Mormon group life. This maladjustment was based chiefly on differences of religious belief, as he clearly states. He then proceeds to interpret Mormon religion and group life as products of this maladjustment. It must be borne in mind, however, that this religious movement which brought about the maladjust? ment was founded on religious motives and doctrines, the most important of which had been proclaimed before any maladjustment was present. In fact, the very proclamation of the new doctrine preceded any Mormon group life, its being the necessary presupposition for the very existence of the Mormon group. In the second stage of Mormon development, religious forces are also at play. Persecution drove the Mormons out of Nauvoo, Illinois, in the winter of 1846. They made their way to the unknown, barren Rocky Mountain region because Joseph Smith had prophesied in none too en? ticing words that they would go there and because Brigham Young, their second leader, claimed to have seen the desert in a vision and knew where he was going. Granting that Mormon solidarity was maintained by persecution before 1846, and after that time by the struggle for ma? terial subsistence, still their exit to the Rockies was certainly greatly in? fluenced by religious conviction. Land was cheap, abundant, and very fertile in Illinois and Missouri. Mormon apostates were honored by non Mormons. Everything, except religious conviction and group solidarity, spoke against the weary journey into the "land of promise." The fact that the Mormons remained in the desert, after having seen it and tasted of its "fruits," is hardly explainable from the struggle between nature and man alone. They might have gone to fruitful Oregon or, with ad? vantage, to the gold fields of California had their religious belief not compelled them to follow their prophet's admonition to remain where they were. No one acquainted with the Mormon civilization will doubt the in? fluence of religious and ethical ideas on economic and social develop? ment. To better understand this influence, one might think of the Mormon movement as never having taken place. Certainly the develop? ment of Utah and much of the surrounding territory would have occurred later and exhibited a very different character. In fact, the very uniqueness of the Mormon civilization and social institutions is due, in the last in? stance, to the religious beliefs and ethical principles which created the Mormon group life. The extent of this uniqueness depends, as a matter of fact, on the degree to which the Mormon religion and ethic are ad? hered.</page><page sequence="34">72 Bennion To ascertain the exact extent of this influence is another problem. One might expect the Mormons to be a rich and prosperous people if we judge their development by their ethic and religion. However, both religious and economic forces have hindered the accumulation of wealth in Mormon territory. The Mormon tithe, fast-offering, donations for chapel and temple building, and the missionary system have directed much money into mate? rially non-productive channels. Polygamy, which was practiced during the last half of the nineteenth century and especially by the better situated, more industrious members of the group chiefly for the purpose of aug? menting the population, had an equalizing and socializing effect on the distribution of wealth. The Mormons were advised to take up agriculture which they did. As a result, the chief mining and power interests, which represent much of the wealth of Mormon territory, have fallen readily into non-Mormon control. The agricultural basis of Mormon economic life combined with the tremendous work and expense in erecting irrigation projects have tended to develop character rather than wealth. Had the same energy been ex? pended in mining, manufacturing or shipping pursuits no doubt the Mor? mon achievements would have been more profitable from a purely economic point of view. It is beyond the purpose of this essay to trace the influence of eco? nomic conditions on religious life. They are certainly not wanting in Mor? mon history. One example will illustrate this point. The social ideal of Mormonism is the law of consecration or "united order" in which surplus property and earnings are held in common to be distributed according to the needs of the individual.37 This type of economic order was introduced in Missouri from 1831 to 1834, and again in sections of Utah from 1874 to 1883 without lasting success. The early history of Mormonism in Utah is characterized by a very high degree of solidarity and economic coopera? tion. This has evolved into an economic individualism quite indistinguish? able from that of non-Mormon groups. This change of economic practice was greatly influenced by economic and social forces such as the increase in wealth, growth of population, and the increasing perplexity of economic processes. No doubt other forces, such as the conception of individual rights as expressed in the Constitution of the United States, have influenced Mor? mon growth more than the Mormons themselves perhaps realize. It is very conceivable that the same Mormon message would have produced a strik 37See Jos. A. Geddes, The United Order among the Mormons (Missouri Phase) Salt Lake City, Utah, 1924.</page><page sequence="35">Business Ethic of World Religions 73 ingly different civilization had it been proclaimed in Catholic or Lutheran countries. These brief notes on the development of Mormonism serve to sub? stantiate Weber's thesis that materialism as an historical method is inade? quate to explain empirical reality. Both Weber's methodological and his historical writings are convincing proof of this fact. The question as to the true origin of religious ideas and motives he leaves unsolved. He presup? poses the coexistence of both religious and economic forces and attempts to illuminate their reaction on each other. He denies that religious forces can at any time be traced to economic conditions and processes only. His essays on the sociology of religion are fruitful in eradicating ever one-sided, dogmatic explanation of reality, an outstanding example of which we have witnessed in historical materialism.38 38See also Wirtschaft u. Gesellschaft, pp. 227-385 for Weber's further treatment of religion.</page></plain_text>
