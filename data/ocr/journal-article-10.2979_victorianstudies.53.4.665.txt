<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> On Suffering and Sympathy:   Jude the Obscure, Evolution, and Ethics Caroline Sumpter “Has the human feeling we call sympathy a natural history?” wondered T. sharper Knowlson in 1910 (8). The possi-bility that sympathy was an evolving instinct, rather than  a God-given trait or a faculty founded on reason, had certainly intrigued  others before him. In The Descent of Man (1871), Charles Darwin specu- lated on the evolutionary significance of sympathy and claimed to be  the first writer to approach the moral sense “exclusively from the side of  natural history” (120). Herbert spencer, T. H. Huxley, and Leslie  stephen also believed that sympathy had evolved and saw its continuing  development as fundamental to moral progress. Here, I argue that  Thomas Hardy was fascinated by sympathy’s “natural history,” and that  Jude the Obscure (1895) contributes to those debates over the origin of  our moral faculties and the legacy of our animal inheritance.  Hardy is known to have read and admired works by Darwin,  Huxley, stephen, and spencer. Yet while Hardy’s interest in the evolu- tionary sciences has received considerable attention, surprisingly few  critics have considered that interest in relation to his understanding of  sympathy.1 While Hardy’s novel engages with all of these writers (without  offering a fully resolved ethical position),2 the influence of Hardy’s  mentor Leslie stephen is particularly striking. Hardy first met stephen  in the 1870s, and described him as the man whose philosophy was to  AbstrAct: This article links Thomas Hardy’s exploration of sympathy in Jude the Obscure  to contemporary scientific debates over moral evolution. Tracing the relationship  between pessimism, progressivism, and determinism in Hardy’s understanding of  sympathy, it also considers Hardy’s conception of the author as enlarger of “social  sympathies”—a position, I argue, that was shaped by Leslie stephen’s advocacy of novel  writing as moral art. Considering Hardy’s engagement with writings by Charles Darwin,  T. H. Huxley, Herbert spencer, and others, I explore the novel’s participation in a  debate about the evolutionary significance of sympathy and its implications for Hardy’s  understanding of moral agency. Hardy, I suggest, offered a stronger defence of morality  based on biological determinism than Darwin, but this determinism was linked to an  unexpected evolutionary optimism.  summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="2"> 666 CaroLIne sumpTer influence his own “more than that of any other contemporary” (Life 102).  While stephen’s reflections on the emotional capacities of animals were  cited approvingly by Darwin, stephen’s writings on the role of sympathy  in literature exerted a deep influence on Hardy the novelist.3 The pages  that follow reveal connections between those spheres of interest. Hardy’s  engagement with debates over emotion and instinct in animals has a  wider significance than has previously been noted, for it reveals the  importance of biological impulse to Hardy’s understanding of ethics.4  Jude may offer a dark vision of the contemporary limits of human  sympathy, but sympathy is also the focus of Hardy’s evolutionary hope.  Teasing out the tensions between pessimism and progres- sivism in Jude, I focus on the novel’s sympathetic protagonists and on  Hardy’s conception of the author as a figure of advanced moral sympa- thies. The latter position, I suggest, was indebted to stephen’s advo- cacy of novel writing as an ethical art. Tracing the influence of  stephen’s evolutionary optimism offers an important corrective to  familiar assumptions about Hardy’s pessimism. stephen and Hardy  reveal fascinating links between evolutionary ethics and aesthetics, for  both saw art as offering a glimpse of moral progress in a universe that  delivered few rewards for individual goodness. In november 1895, when a number of reviewers were charging  Jude with sexual immorality, Hardy was arguing strongly for the novel’s  moral purpose. But he was focusing on a very different part of the  book. sending a chapter to the editor of the Animal’s Friend, and  offering him rights to republish in his periodical free of charge, Hardy  suggested that “one of the scenes might be made useful in the teaching  of mercy in the slaughtering of animals for the meat market—the  cruelties involved in that business having been a great grief to me for  years” (Letters 97). The pig-sticking scene is a pivotal one in the novel,  and not merely for the bleak insight it offers into the breakdown of  Jude’s marriage. While arabella wants to bleed the animal slowly,  extending its death over ten minutes to prevent bloodying the meat,  Jude dispatches the pig quickly, expressing compassion for the animal  and horror at having to slaughter it: However unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done. The blood flowed  out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she had desired. The dying  animal’s cry assumed its third and final tone, the shriek of agony; his glazing eyes  riveting themselves on arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature  recognizing at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends. (64)5  vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="3"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 667 In this scene, the pig communicates to Jude not only agony and  reproach, but “a squeak of surprise,” “repeated cries of rage,” and the  “slow and hopeless” cry of despair (64).6 Hardy, who declared himself  one of “the earliest acclaimers of The Origin of Species” (Life 158), here  appears to draw out the ethical implications of Darwin’s later work. In  The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), Darwin argued  that it was often possible for humans to register emotional states in  other species: “the deep grunt of satisfaction offered by a pig, when  pleased with its food, is widely different from its harsh scream of pain  or terror” (96). stephen, in “Darwinism and Divinity” (1872), echoed  Darwin’s confidence in cross-species communication of feeling: an  animal such as a dog, displaying rudimentary powers of reason, could  also “make sounds indicative of his wants and emotions” (412).  unlike arabella, Jude is prey to a sympathetic instinct that  makes him view the pig as a “fellow-mortal” (65). Yet this is not simply a  one-way process: the pig’s “eloquently keen reproach” toward his “only  friends” endows the animal with social instincts and complex “passions,  affections and emotions” readable by the human saddled with the melan- choly job of dispatching it (Darwin, Descent 100). In fact, for Darwin,  while humans could sometimes respond to the emotional states of  animals, they were not the only creatures capable of expressing sympathy  or able to sympathize across the species barrier (Descent 121, 126).7  Darwin suggested that the evolution of sympathy in both human and  animal populations had a clear biological rationale: social instincts had  reproductive advantages for a kinship group, and were therefore favored  by natural selection. “Those communities, which included the greatest  number of the most sympathetic members,” Darwin argued, “would  flourish best, and raise the greatest number of offspring” (Descent 130). The continuum between human and animal emotion was  boldly stated in the Descent: “Besides love and sympathy, animals  exhibit other qualities connected with the social instincts, which in us  would be called moral” (127). as their intellectual powers developed  nearer to those of humans, all animals would “inevitably acquire a  moral sense”; dogs already possessed “something very like a conscience”  (127). In “Darwinism and Divinity” (one of several works stephen  recommended to Hardy), stephen was clear that when a scientist  “traces the origin of our moral sense to some dumb instinct in the  animal world, he is not really speaking treason against the dignity and  importance of morality” (414).8 That morality might be an evolutionary  summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="4"> 668 CaroLIne sumpTer and adaptive trait, rather than the product of reason or evidence of  divine justice, was a possibility Darwin handled cautiously, but one  Hardy found highly suggestive.9 When Hardy was writing Jude, the question of whether animals  had moral impulses was the subject of renewed public debate.10 In his  series of articles “on Justice,” published in the Nineteenth Century in  1890, Herbert spencer argued for a form of “animal-ethics,” claiming  that “egoistic acts, as well as altruistic acts, in animals are classed as  good or bad.” Good acts were synonymous “with preservation of  offspring or the individual.” for spencer, human justice developed  from “sub-human,” animal justice: these were “essentially of the same  nature,” forming “parts of a continuous whole” (“Justice” 436, 444;  “Justice Concluded” 613).11 If Hardy knew his spencer, he was also influenced by another  thinker’s very different understanding of the relationship between  nature and justice. Hardy praised Thomas Henry Huxley as “a man  who united a fearless mind with the warmest of hearts” (Life 125).  When Huxley delivered his celebrated romanes lecture “evolution  and ethics” in oxford in 1893, he presented the natural world as the  product of a non-moral cosmic process. nature could be no guide to  human ethics. a similar position had been taken by John stuart mill in  On Nature, but Huxley’s role as arch champion of Darwinism altered  the debate.12 Huxley’s injunction that care for the weak and the sick  was an ethical imperative—that human conscience sometimes decreed  it necessary to check nature’s indifference to human life (Evolution  52)—was a clear refutation of spencer’s assumption that human  morality evolved harmoniously from natural laws. In his 1893 response, published in the Contemporary Review,  stephen endorsed Huxley’s notion of an amoral nature, a position  which Hardy subsequently made clear was also his own (Life 439). In  “ethics and the struggle for existence,” stephen argued that: morality proper . . . begins when sympathy begins; when we really desire the  happiness of others or, as Kant says, when we treat other men as an end and not  simply as a means. . . . The human mother sacrifices herself with a consciousness  of the results to herself. . . . The animal sacrifices herself but without conscious- ness and therefore without moral worth. (162) sympathy, according to this view, could not be reduced to instinct alone  or exist independently of a rational understanding of self-sacrifice. In   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="5"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 669 fact, in this essay stephen repeated many of the arguments made in his  1882 book The Science of Ethics, where he stated: “put yourself in his place” is not merely a moral precept; it is a logical rule implied  in the earliest germs of reason as a description of reasoning itself, so far as it deals  with other sentient beings. . . . sympathy and reason have so far an identical  factor—each implies the other. (230) Yet stephen’s arguments were contradictory, for while he  focused in these works on the necessity of reason, logic, and rule-making  to the exercise of morality, drawing on a Kantian categorical imperative,  he had previously placed a much greater emphasis on instinct as the  basis of ethics. He had also questioned whether consciousness was  unique to humans. In “Darwinism and Divinity,” stephen described the  “condemnation of the poor brutes as non-moral” as “monstrous” (413).  There, he argued that while a bird who loves its young does not form  moral propositions, it is “on the high road” to finding them: “light up its  feeble brain with a little more intelligence, and it will have no trouble in  fitting its instincts with the proper strait waistcoats of formula” (413).  While Kant believed that reason, not natural inclination, decides moral  duty, stephen argued that instinct preceded and shaped reason: reason  was both fundamental to sympathy and founded on an instinctive  capacity for sympathetic projection.13  These post-Darwinian debates over the role of reason and  feeling in ethics echoed discussions familiar from eighteenth-century  moral philosophy. In 1751, David Hume pointed to “a controversy  started of late . . . concerning the general foundation of morals; whether  they be derived from reason, or from sentiment; whether we attain  the knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction, or by an  immediate feeling and finer internal sense” (2). In a nineteenth- century evolutionary context, however, these discussions also had new  implications for the treatment and classification of animals. non- human animals acted “heroically” through instinct and feeling rather  than reflection: on this basis, Darwin denied them the status of moral  agents and subjects (Descent 135).  stephen felt that humans had no need to put themselves in the  place of animals, which could indeed be treated as means, not ends. In  “ethics and the struggle for existence,” he argued that the growth of  the human intellect had naturally given his own species superiority  over other animals: summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="6"> 670 CaroLIne sumpTer many of the lower species thus become subordinate, parts of the social organism— that is to say, of the new equilibrium which has been established. There is so far a  reciprocal advantage. . . . The pig has a stronger interest than any one in the  demand for bacon. . . . He has to pay for his privileges by an early death; but he  makes a good bargain of it. (162) Jude, of course, is far less convinced of the “reciprocal advantage” to  the pig. Jude the Obscure hardly endorses stephen’s cheerful subordina- tion of animals to human needs, but it also refrains from dismissing  the pragmatism of stephen’s argument. The novel is all too conscious  of the pig’s place in a social organism watched over by no benevolent  Creator, and arabella’s protestations cannot be easily dismissed: “Thank God!” Jude said. “He’s dead.”  “What’s God got to do with such a messy job as a pig-killing, I should like to  know!” she said scornfully. “poor folks must live.”  “I know, I know,” said he. “I don’t scold you.” (65) In 1889, Hardy responded to a cleric struggling to reconcile a  benevolent God with merciless nature by suggesting that he give up that  struggle: he would profit more by consulting “the recently published Life  of Darwin, and the works of Herbert spencer and other agnostics” (Life  214). The place of ethics within an environment in which humans had  close biological kinship with other animals was to trouble Hardy all his  life. In a 1910 letter to the Humanitarian League, Hardy wrote:  few people seem to perceive fully as yet that the most far-reaching consequence of  the establishment of the common origin of all species is ethical; that it logically  involved a re-adjustment of altruistic morals by enlarging as a necessity of rightness  the application of what has been called “The Golden rule” beyond the area of  mere mankind to the whole animal kingdom. possibly Darwin himself did not  wholly perceive it, though he alluded to it. (Life 377)14 although this statement has appeared in discussions of Hardy’s atti- tude to animal rights, critics have rarely noted that the allusion to the  Christian Golden rule—the injunction found in Luke 6:31—is indeed  Darwin’s own, and as such exposes interesting tensions in Darwin’s  understanding of moral origins. In the Descent, Darwin wrote: The moral sense perhaps affords the best and highest distinction between man  and the lower animals; but I need say nothing on this head, as I have so lately  endeavoured to shew that the social instincts,—the prime principle of man’s   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="7"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 671 moral constitution—with the aid of active intellectual powers and the effects of  habit, naturally lead to the golden rule, “as ye would that men should do to you,  do ye to them likewise”; and this lies at the foundation of morality. (151) Yet, as we have seen, Darwin had also described “social instincts”  and “complex emotions” shared between humans and other animals.  Differences in the “intellectual powers” between humans and other  species were due to natural selection rather than divine attribution.  Despite the biblical allusions, Darwin clearly stated that morality was not  based on a “special God-implanted conscience” (139). moreover, while  he suggested that moral rule-making “lies at the foundation of morality,”  human moral actions could occur without such reflective acts. “The aid  which we feel impelled to give to the helpless is mainly an incidental  result of the instinct of sympathy,” Darwin wrote; nor “could we check  our sympathy, even at the urging of hard reason, without deterioration  in the noblest part of our nature” (Descent 159). In this confusing formu- lation, reason both sits at the heart of morality and potentially conflicts  with the instinct of sympathy, which also seems to function as an internal  ethical urge.  Confusion over the role of instinct, reason, and habit in the  evolution of sympathy (as well as in the evolution of morality) is clearly  apparent in the Descent, particularly in a passage Hardy may have had  in mind in his response to the Humanitarian League: sympathy beyond the confines of man, that is, humanity to the lower animals seems  to be one of the latest moral acquisitions. . . . This virtue, one of the noblest with  which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming  more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient  beings. as soon as this virtue is honoured and practised by some few men, it spreads  through instruction and example to the young, and eventually becomes incorpo- rated in public opinion. . . . Looking to future generations, there is no cause to  think that social instincts will grow weaker, and we may expect virtuous habits will  grow stronger, becoming perhaps fixed through inheritance. (147, 150)15  a virtue arising “incidentally”—an evolutionary extension of sympathy  to animals, initially affecting just a few individuals—is subsequently  spread through reason and habit. at the same time, virtuous habits  might eventually become biological instincts. such a position was yet  fully to be disproved: mendel’s research outlining the correct process  of genetic transmission lay unread in Darwin’s library (ekman xxxiii).  If Darwin did not entirely dispense with Lamarckian notions of  summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="8"> 672 CaroLIne sumpTer “use-inheritance,” however, others, including august Weismann, did.  Hardy took extensive notes on the work of Weismann, whose theory of  “germ-cells” proposed a purely biological explanation for the trans- mission of hereditary traits (Weismann 69). Despite Hardy’s claim that it was “logical” to extend “The  Golden rule” to animals, it was Hardy rather than Darwin who  provided the stauncher defense of a morality based on biological  determinism rather than rule-making. Indeed, Hardy was much less  convinced than Darwin about the positive role of reason and habit in  moral development. If Jude and sue are placed within Darwin’s evolu- tionary paradigm, they are clearly among his “few men” (and women)  whose sympathies already extend to both humans and animals. Yet  these highly sympathetic individuals are crushed by public opinion  rather than able to reform it through “instruction and example.”  While from childhood Jude feels sympathy for the birds he is supposed  to scare, sue impulsively frees pigeons destined for slaughter; neither  can bear the suffering of a rabbit ensnared in a trap. In the aftermath  of her rape, Tess’s sympathy for the suffering pheasants in Tess of the  D’Urbervilles owes little to social instruction and example. Yet in Hardy’s  last novel, the young Jude’s instinctive extension of sympathy to the  animal kingdom presents him with an unsolvable problem. Beaten by  farmer Troutham for failing to scare the birds from his crops, he  becomes dimly aware of “the flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which  what was good for God’s birds was bad for God’s gardener” (11). Huxley made extended use of this metaphor.16 In the prole- gomena to Evolution and Ethics (1894), he reiterated claims made in his  lecture of the previous year that the human ethical process—the  gradual evolution of primitive social feelings into “the organised and  personified sympathy we call conscience”—often conflicted with the  cosmic process, the amoral principle of the survival of the fittest. for  Huxley, the gradual, ennobling increase in sympathy entailed  increased suffering, as humanity became more fully conscious of the  pain of others. While it was for humans a moral duty to check their  “ape and tiger promptings,” these were not always easy to vanquish. If  population reached a crisis point and outstripped resources, the brutal  human struggle for survival would inevitably resurface. significantly, Huxley also saw rational limits to the exercise of  sympathy. He cautioned that if sympathy were extended to every self- asserting malefactor, the whole polity would be destroyed:  vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="9"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 673 The followers of “the golden rule” may indulge in high hopes of heaven, but they  must reckon with the certainty that other people will be masters of the earth. What  would become of the garden if the gardener treated all the weeds and slugs and  birds and trespassers as he would like to be treated, if he were in their place? (51–52) This is exactly how Jude treats the birds in the field, with whom he feels  “a magic thread of fellow-feeling,” his heart growing “sympathetic with  the birds’ thwarted desires” (9). after Jude suffers a beating for failing  to scare them off, the narrator notes: Though farmer Troutham had just hurt him, he was a boy who could not himself  bear to hurt anything. He had never brought home a nest of young birds without  lying awake in misery half the night after, and often reinstating them and the nest  in their original place the next morning. He could scarcely bear to see trees cut  down or lopped, from a fancy that it hurt them. . . . This weakness of character, as  it may be called, suggested that he was the sort of man who was born to ache a  good deal before the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life should signify  that all was well with him again. (11) Jude’s actions, based on neither a rational application of the “golden  rule” nor “instruction and example,” are the result of feeling: he is  destined to “ache a good deal” due to this “weakness of character.” Here,  the failure of Huxleyan pragmatism seems to give way to schopen- haurian pessimism.17 Yet these were not the only writers to suggest that  acute sympathy led to greater suffering. for a number of contemporary  theorists, hatred of inflicting pain on living things could be read simul- taneously as a sign of moral advance and as a “weakness of character.” In a 1910 letter to the editor of the Animal’s Guardian, Hardy  acknowledged in distinctly Huxleyan terms “the difficulty of carrying  out to its logical extreme the principle of equal justice to all the animal  kingdom.” “Whatever humanity may try to do,” he said, “there remains  the stumbling block that nature herself is absolutely indifferent to  justice, and how to instruct nature is rather a large problem” (Public Voice  312). Deeply troubled that the evolution of human intelligence and  sympathy had led to an increase in pain, Hardy felt burdened by his  knowledge of a cosmic process never fully under human control. In 1881  he wrote that “the emotions have no place in a world of defect, and it is a  cruel injustice that they should have developed in it” (Life 153).  Jude, likewise, concludes early on that “nature’s logic was too  horrid for him to care for” (13), while sue grapples with the same  problem: “Why should nature’s law be mutual butchery!” she laments,  summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="10"> 674 CaroLIne sumpTer unwisely imparting that knowledge to Little father Time (323). The  reader is left to consider whether Jude’s instinctive fellow-feeling with  the natural world is subverted by unjust social conventions, or by an  indifferent nature’s attempts to regain the garden. social convention,  which condemns their unmarried state, prevents sue and Jude from  finding adequate lodgings, but “nature’s law” plays an inevitable role.  Little father Time, killing himself and his siblings because they are  “too meny,” cannot understand a world of defect in which humans are  unable to control their numbers (325). While Tess is old enough to feel  “malthusian vexation” with her mother (Tess 37), Time assumes that  sue has “sent” for another child (352, 355). In part one of The Principles of Ethics (first published as The Data  of Ethics in 1879), Herbert spencer had argued that such malthusian  realities—resulting in the imperfect fitness of the human organism to  the environment—acted to check sympathy’s growth. He noted that  “while the rate of multiplication continues so to exceed the rate of  mortality as to cause pressure on the means of subsistence, there  continues to result much unhappiness”: Gradually then, and only gradually, as these various causes of unhappiness  become less can sympathy become greater. Life would be intolerable if, while the  causes of misery remained as they now are, all men were not only in a high degree  sensitive to the pains, bodily and mental, felt by those around and expressed in  the faces of those they met, but were unceasingly conscious of the miseries every- where being suffered as consequences of war, crime, misconduct, misfortune,  improvidence, incapacity. But, as the moulding and re-moulding of man and  society into mutual fitness progresses, and as the pains caused by unfitness  decrease, sympathy can increase in the presence of the pleasures that come from  fitness. (246) In spencerian terms, Jude and sue’s socially anomalous sensitivity is a  form of “unfitnesss” condemning them to just such an “intolerable”  fate. While Huxley saw increased suffering as resulting from the  sympathetic recognition of others’ pain, for spencer a truly suffering  society would produce not sympathy but callousness: sympathy is moti- vated by the pleasure it affords the bestower. In some of sue’s responses  to Jude, however, Hardy’s narrator seems to question spencer’s notion  that sympathy can be both an egoistic and an altruistic pleasure. The argument for a pleasure-oriented sympathy was familiar:  edmund Burke, for example, had suggested that sympathy with pain  produced “delight mixed with uneasiness” in the sympathizer (33).18 at   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="11"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 675 one point, Jude’s narrator ponders whether individuals might actually  inflict suffering on others in the pursuit of sympathetic pleasure.  When sue, knowing that Jude loves her, insists that he give her away at  her wedding to phillotson, Jude wonders, Was it that [women] were, instead of more sensitive, as reputed, more callous, and  less romantic; or were they more heroic? or was sue simply so perverse that she  wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful luxury of practising  long-suffering in her own person, and of being touched with tender pity for him at  having made him practise it? (181–82) While the novel explores the possibility of sympathy’s “perverse” plea- sures, Hardy seems unconvinced that pleasure is sympathy’s motivating  force. and while Darwin acknowledged his considerable debt to adam  smith and alexander Bain, he challenged their embrace of that assump- tion. In the Descent, sympathy is shown to operate independently of such  motives: “man seems often to act impulsively, that is from instinct or  long habit, without any consciousness of pleasure, in the same manner  as does probably a bee or ant, when it blindly follows its instincts” (145).  for Darwin, instinct and habit could explain, in ways pleasure-based  theories of sympathy could not, why individuals might act against their  own interests. In plunging into a torrent to save a stranger, a person  might be compelled by “the mere force of inheritance” (128, 134).  In Hardy’s novel, this often seems to be the case. Individuals  are endowed from birth with variable levels of sympathy; such  responses seem not to be made by choice, nor are they often pleasur- able. When phillotson lets sue leave their marriage, for instance, he  claims, “I simply am going to act by instinct, and let principles take  care of themselves” (241). Those instincts lead to his suffering and  social disgrace. When he takes sue back after the death of her chil- dren, he worries that he is “not quite following out the humane  instincts which had induced him to let her go” (390). Jude feels an  “inconvenient sympathy” for arabella that is directly at variance with  his own pleasure (277). arabella, untroubled by such instincts, instead  follows Huxley’s “ape and tiger” promptings: in her dealings with Jude,  she has “no more sympathy than a tigress” (190).  sue and Jude, meanwhile, demonstrate an instinctive ability to  respond to one another’s emotional states. phillotson repeatedly refers  to their “extraordinary sympathy, or similarity” (241), and the narrator  notes “that complete mutual understanding, in which every glance and  summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="12"> 676 CaroLIne sumpTer movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence  between them, made them almost the two parts of a single whole”  (306). along with a Darwinian focus on the increased sympathy within  kinship groups (Jude and sue are cousins) are echoes of spencer’s  claim in The Principles of Ethics that, as moral evolution advanced, such  responsiveness would become universal (247–49). What is the fate, however, of those anomalous individuals who  already experience acute sympathy in a society in which it is not  universal? Darwin was clear that, though sympathy was beneficial to  the survival of a species or group, the most self-sacrificing individuals  would not directly benefit: putting themselves at risk threatened the  survival of their offspring. Leslie stephen agreed: the best stock for the  race, he claimed in “ethics and the struggle for existence,” “will not  deviate so widely from the average type.” stephen suggested: saints who are “too good to live” . . . do not answer in practice, because they are  instruments too delicate for the rough work of daily life. They may give a foretaste of  the qualities which will some day be possible for the average man; of intellectual or  moral qualities which, though now exceptional, may become commonplace. (168) Jude, an advanced moral type, may give a foretaste of the man of the  future, but he is ill-adapted to his current environment and cannot  secure his children’s survival. In a notebook entry of 1875, Hardy  quotes Theodore Watts: “science tells us that, in the struggle for life, the  surviving organism is not necessarily that which is absolutely the best  in an ideal sense, though it must be that which is most in harmony with  surrounding conditions”(Notebooks 1: 392). for spencer, excessively  altruistic individuals, unable to maintain a healthy egoism, were not  only out of harmony with their surroundings but were also a social  liability, increasing the selfishness of others. such an increase is  suggested in arabella’s manipulation of Jude’s sympathy: “never such a  tender fool as Jude is if a woman seems in trouble, and coaxes him a  bit! Just as he used to be about birds and things” (283). for spencer,  however, the fact that they were less likely to pass on offspring meant  that “unduly altruistic and unduly egoistic individuals” would be elimi- nated while the “average type” prevailed (Principles of Ethics I: 204). Hardy’s achievement may be to make us feel the loss of altru- ists in individual terms. as sue tells Jude, “remember that the best and  greatest among mankind are those who do themselves no worldly  good. every successful man is more or less a selfish man. The devoted   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="13"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 677 fail” (382). Jude dies alone. similarly, while The Woodlanders (1887)  ends with marty south’s conviction that Giles Winterborne was “a  good man,” he is also a dead one, having fallen fatally ill after giving  up his shelter to his love, Grace melbury. Like Grace’s inconvenient  sympathy for her husband fitzpiers’s mistresses, Giles’s negation of self  offers no pleasure to anyone: in an ironic twist, Grace winds up in the  arms of her philandering husband. While their fates indict a barbaric  society, it is still possible to register in them a spencerian concern that  excess sympathy is an evolutionary liability. The least sympathetic  characters—arabella and fitzpiers—are also the most socially adapted,  best placed to secure their own happiness and survival. Hardy was certainly intrigued by how spencer’s “unduly altru- istic individuals,” sue’s “the best and greatest,” came to exist at all.  While sketching the outline of Jude, Hardy was particularly interested  in the psychological origin of self-sacrifice. from 1888–90 he tran- scribed in his notebooks extensive passages from the psychologist  Henry maudsley’s Natural Causes and Supernatural Seemings, including  the following: on how very small a minority of men the boasted progress depends actually [ . . . ]  how vast an organisation of hostile superstition is ever fighting against progress &amp;  labouring to arrest it. The extinction of a few hundred persons . . . might throw  the world back into intellectual barbarism. . . . so also with the aspirations &amp; the  endeavour to realise a high moral ideal; it is not the many, but a select few, who  have kept the flame alive . . . The many . . . rest only on the frail structures of tradi- tion, custom, law, &amp; opinion. (qtd. in Notebooks 2: 1501–06)19 for maudsley, intellectual and moral progress depended on the aber- rant: the “Benefactors and at the same time martyrs of humanity” (73).  Yet these individuals’ moral advancement is ill-suited to their environ- ment, and as such is a form of mental imbalance: “for evolutional  [originality], a brain is required wh. is not well-balanced [as to] facul- ties &amp; circumstances” (Notebooks 2: 1501–06).  In her discussion of the novel, Jane Wood highlights maudsley’s  belief that women were more inclined to intense feeling than ratio- nality, arguing that in Jude the dilemma as to whether sue’s ideas and behaviour showed signs of an extraor- dinary refinement of the senses or an aberrant psychology is somewhat hastily  resolved by linking the two together so that her intelligence is presented as insepa- rable from “the perverseness that was part of her.” (204) summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="14"> 678 CaroLIne sumpTer In the maudsley quotation cited above, however, “extraordinary refine- ment” of the senses is inseparable from “aberrant psychology.” Both  signify a lack of evolutionary fit with circumstances. The novel strongly  suggests that hereditary factors, not training and habit, lead to sue and  Jude’s social restlessness and excess of sympathy. Hardy wrote in a letter  to edmund Gosse, “the doom or curse of hereditary temperament pecu- liar to the family of the parties” was the main factor in the “tragic issue”  of their marriages (Defence 8). That curse of heredity, however, also seems  to constitute their originality as maudsley’s moral pioneers, who are able  to see through “the frail structures of tradition.” Jude the Obscure stages a debate about the relative ethical func- tions of instinct, reason, and public opinion, and offers a troubling  account of the relationship between them. In the Descent, Darwin  suggested that it should be borne in mind . . . that the enforcement of public opinion depends on  our appreciation of the approbation and disapprobation of others; and this appre- ciation is founded on our sympathy, which it can hardly be doubted was originally  developed through natural selection. (169) Darwin, following Bain, suggests sympathy is the foundation of the  human fear of censure and desire for praise, and endows public opinion  with an ethically regulating role. He goes on to state that “the social  instincts . . . still give the impulse to some of [man’s] best actions; but his  actions are in a higher degree determined by the expressed wishes and  judgements of his fellow-men, and unfortunately very often by his own  strong selfish desires” (153). Yet Darwin did not clarify how public  opinion achieved its higher ethical status, or why it should provide  greater communal advantage than the “social instincts” from which it  developed. He partially acknowledged this problem, admitting that The judgement of the community will generally be guided by some rude experi- ence of what is best in the long run for all the members; but this judgement will  not rarely err from ignorance and weak powers of reasoning. Hence the strangest  customs and superstitions, in complete opposition to the true welfare and happi- ness of mankind, have become all powerful throughout the world. (146) “We must conform!” declares a broken sue after the death of her chil- dren. When Jude suggests that it is not God but “man and senseless  circumstance” that they are fighting against, sue concurs, acknowledging   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="15"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 679 she has become “as superstitious as a savage” (361). In Jude, custom and  public opinion fail to offer that ethically regulating role that Darwin  optimistically granted them; the few sympathetic individuals are left to  rely on their rudely acquired “social instincts.” phillotson’s sympathy in  allowing sue her freedom is judged unjustifiable by the court of public  opinion, which punishes him for his behavior:  To indulge one’s instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and right, was not,  he had found, permitted with impunity in an old civilization like ours. . . . It was  necessary to act under an acquired and cultivated sense of the same, if you wished  to enjoy an average share of comfort and honour. (379) While George Levine considers phillotson to be motivated by “ justice  and reason, those great enlightenment ideals” (“Cartesian” 123), justice  for phillotson is not the product of reason, but is instead “instinctive and  uncontrolled.”  While critics have emphasized the “blind and irrational  tendencies” that cause Jude’s characters “to act in a destructive manner”  (Kelly 239–40), Hardy offers the possibility that not just troublesome  sexual desires but also sympathetic, moral impulses are “blind and  irrational.” In pitting “instinctive” justice against cultivation and civili- zation, Hardy’s narrator goes further than Darwin in asserting a  biological basis for ethical action. During his final defeated return to  Christminster, Jude states: I am in a chaos of principles—groping in the dark—acting by instinct and not  after example. . . . I doubt if I have anything more for my present rule of life than  following inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and actually give  pleasure to those I love best. . . . I perceive there is something wrong somewhere in  our social formulas. (345) Though motivated by “instincts” and “inclinations” held since child- hood, Jude’s moral actions are thwarted by the community’s judgment.  Darwin’s claim that once the virtue of sympathy “is honoured and  practised by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example  to the young, and eventually becomes incorporated in public opinion”  is clearly in doubt: sue and Jude’s children don’t survive them. robert schweik argues that “in Hardy’s vision of the universe of  The Woodlanders, there appear to be no acceptable moral choices. Tess  and Jude provide similarly bleak views of the human predicament” (64).  summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="16"> 680 CaroLIne sumpTer Yet while Tess and Jude have been read as studies in pessimism, some  contemporary readers thought the former extolled progress and indeed  read “like a positivist allegory” (frederic Harrison qtd. in Watts 481). In  fact, Hardy’s determinism is more central than his pessimism: for in  questioning whether morality may be a choice at all, Jude is not without  its glimpses of evolutionary optimism. Hardy praised the positivist James  augustus Cotter morison’s The Service of Man: An Essay Towards the Reli- gion of the Future (1887) (Letters 1: 173). among Hardy’s transcriptions of  that book was morison’s claim that “the man who sees new duties . . .  beyond the circle of conventional obligation . . . is a moral inventor, an  enlarger of human life. Those who saw the claims of the slave were such;  those who see the claims of animals are the same” (Notebooks 2: 1470).  Jude similarly concludes, “our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any  good to us” (422–23). Hardy, in a letter on animal rights, wrote, “The  human race being still practically barbarian, it does not seem likely that  man’s delight in cruel sports can be lessened except by slow degrees”  (Public Voice 458),20 yet a gradual evolution from moral barbarism to civi- lization was assumed nevertheless. and when, in 1874, the Spectator  guessed that the anonymously published Far from the Madding Crowd was  George eliot’s, Hardy explained that he “had latterly been reading  Comte’s Positive Philosophy, and writings of that school, some of whose  expressions had thus passed into [my] vocabulary” (Life 100). The influ- ence of eliot’s expressions had already struck home for Hardy directly,  who, in an 1867 notebook, had transcribed this line from Adam Bede:  “sorrow lives in us as an indestructible force . . . passing from pain into  sympathy” (Notebooks 2: 16). In 1890, when Hardy was planning Jude, he appeared to echo  eliot’s sentiment: altruism, or The Golden rule, or whatever “Love your neighbour as Yourself”  may be called, will ultimately be brought about I think by the pain we see in others  reacting on ourselves, as if we and they were a part of one body. mankind, in fact,  may be and possibly will be viewed as members of one corporeal frame. (Life 235) If Comte’s arguments for the progressive evolution of human sympa- thies from egoism toward universal altruism appealed to Hardy, he was  also aware of their ethical limitations. Hardy knew the British positiv- ists John morley, frederic Harrison, and e. s. Beesly, and was well-read  in Comtean doctrines, but he couldn’t pledge himself to the cause.21  as Thomas Dixon notes, the Golden rule—love your neighbor as   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="17"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 681 yourself—offers a substantively different formula than “live for others,”  the mantra of the atheist Comte’s religion of Humanity (371–72).  While Hardy conflates these concepts, suggesting that they will evolve  through instinctive feeling, elsewhere he seems to recognize their  incompatibility, and the danger of living for others in a barbaric society  is something he recognized. Though unable to put it into practice,  Jude understands that to follow the Golden rule means to do himself  as well as others no harm. The Woodlanders’s Giles Winterbourne is an  altruist but not a follower of the Golden rule: failing to love himself as  his neighbor, he dies for another. sue’s claim that “self-abnegation is  the higher road” leads her to stifle “a last instinct of human affection,”  covering “her ears with her hands” to block out Jude’s coughing (412).  seeking to obliterate herself, she thwarts her own sympathetic instincts  and becomes less, not more, responsive to his pain. Contrary to  Levine’s claim, the “ideal of selflessness” does not seem to provide  grounds for stability and moral authority (Levine, “Cartesian” 126). If Hardy’s late novels deny redemption through self-sacrifice,  they do not deny the slow evolution of the human sympathies; this  belief owed as much to stephen’s optimism as it did to that of Comte or  Darwin. In The Science of Ethics, stephen wrote, and so we may observe, that as society becomes more civilised, as the reasoning  faculties become quicker and wider . . . there is an improvement in the virtue of  humanity if in nothing else. To think about other beings is to stimulate our sympa- thies, and our sensibility is quickened—to the regret of some people—by the same  power which implies intellectual progress. (233) If Hardy shared such hopes, however, an ultimate faith in moral and  intellectual progress did little to assuage the injustice of the unequal  distribution of suffering and sympathy in the present. for morison,  although habit was essential in developing moral natures, it required  that individuals have a “congenital tap root” of moral instincts. It was  possible to be born without them: “their presence or absence in the  individual is no merit or fault of his. a man inherits his brain as much  as he inherits his estate” (Service of Man 292). morison suggested that  there was no social remedy for those lacking moral instincts, unless  the unsympathetic could be stopped from breeding. In such deterministic analyses, the question was not why an indi- vidual should choose to be good but rather what consolation the agnostic  might find for those destined to be so. morison included a long quota- tion from The Science of Ethics, in which stephen had referred to summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="18"> 682 CaroLIne sumpTer the multiform and profound problem which has tortured men in all ages. virtue— no one denies it—does good to somebody, but how often to the agent? . . . The  highest self-denial is repaid by the blackest ingratitude; the keenest sympathy with  our fellow implies the greatest liability to suffering; the cold, the sensual, and the  systematically selfish, often seem to have the pleasantest lots in life. (qtd. in  morison 308–09) Consolation was to be found in a different earthly realm. In The Service  of Man, morison linked advanced moral sensibilities to the capacity for  sophisticated taste, an argument familiar to eighteenth-century  aesthetics and nineteenth-century evolutionary theory alike. spencer  had suggested that those who “care nothing about the feelings of other  people are, by implication, shut out from a wide range of aesthetic  pleasures” (Principles 1: 25), while stephen argued that “the dullness  which incapacitates a boor for appreciating the feelings of the refined  nature is so far a disqualification for all the more complex social activi- ties” (Science 233). While spencer thought a gang of convicts would be  unlikely to be moved by alfred Tennyson, morison took a decidedly  spencerian line in a passage from The Service of Man that Hardy copied  into his notebooks: The sympathetic, generous heart, which recognizes the rights &amp; claims of others,  wh. is pained by their suffering, &amp; rejoices in their joy, is declared [by spencer] to be  the only trustworthy source of that social morality on wh. general well-being  depends. In this respect, moral conduct regarded as an art, as it is, indeed, incompa- rably the finest of the fine arts, does not differ from its inferior congeners. no one  expects fine pictures or statues from persons devoid of all aesthetic taste . . . &amp;c . . .  This is not giving up the cause of morality . . . But . . . the determinist  demands pupils who can learn. (Notebooks 1: 1217) for morison, morality itself becomes an art, while artistic appreciation  becomes a sign of moral faculty.  Hardy was clearly impressed by the 1881 Cornhill Magazine article  “The moral element in Literature” (which he cites at least twice in his  notebooks) in which stephen stated that an artist needs to “feel rightly  and vigorously upon ethical questions,” and that “it is impossible to ever  really exclude moral considerations from aesthetical judgments” (50). a  lack of moral faculty was a sign that the instincts were “defective or  perverted” (42); the highest literary creation (and appreciation) relied  on a “tender sympathy with all human feeling” (44). Hardy repeats this  idea in “The science of fiction,” arguing that an author’s powers of   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="19"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 683 external observation were nothing if he lacked sympathy (Public Voice  110), and, in a notebook entry, transforms a phrase from stephen’s article  into literary precept: “Find utterance for the deepest emotions of your  contemporaries” (Notebooks 1: 1417). Hardy’s earlier transcription of parts  of “The moral element” included stephen’s praise for the novelist, who reveals to us certain aspects of the world in which we live &amp; the men who live in  it, . . . truths capable of being proved by direct intuition. . . . If we are so consti- tuted so as to be unable to see what he sees, he can go no further. . . . But, on the  other hand, so far as we are in sympathy with him, the proof—if it be a proof—has  all the cogency of direct vision. (Notebooks 1: 1217) for stephen, the truly great author enables us to see “in the light of  keener perceptions than our own”; art depends on the “moral qualities  of the seer” (Notebooks 1: 1217). The poet “does not force definite prop- ositions upon our intellects, but catches our sympathies by an indefin- able sympathy” (stephen, “art and morality” 99). Yet the moral  responsiveness of readers cannot be guaranteed: only those already  “in sympathy” with the author will fully respond to his vision. “In a world where good and evil are so intricately blended,”  wrote stephen, “where we have so many causes for sorrow and sympathy,  the greatest men will be most profoundly sensitive to the sadness of the  world” (“moral element” 48). In Jude, Hardy’s sensitivity to the “sadness  of the world” met with the variable responses stephen might have  predicted. roger ebbatson rightly argues that Hardy’s tragic novels  record “a radical extension of moral sympathy” (40), yet Hardy’s letters  in the wake of Jude suggest that sympathy wasn’t a response the novel  successfully activated in most readers. In an 1895 letter, Hardy wrote, as an illustration of the grotesque contrasts in life the reviews are interesting: this  being almost the first book of mine of which I feared that the Job-cum-ezekiel  moralist loomed too largely behind the would-be artist. I suppose the times are  still too barbarous to strike a blow—however indirectly, for humanity towards  man, woman or the lower animals. (Letters 2: 96) Jude’s readership, Hardy believed, was still too morally “barbarous” to  appreciate it, just as The Hand of Ethelberta was “thirty years too soon” (qtd.  in maitland 276). Hardy repeatedly casts himself as a figure whose moral  sympathies are ahead of his time (Letters 2: 95; Life 297). The problem is  that those advanced sympathies are detectable only by readers who  already share those traits. Jude charts Hardy’s struggle to keep faith with  summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="20"> 684 CaroLIne sumpTer evolutionary meliorism, revealing his tentative hope that an ongoing  process was bringing the world gradually closer to universal sympathy.  stephen had claimed that art could “advance or retard the moral develop- ment of the race” (“art” 93), but Jude’s reception left Hardy unsure of  fiction’s progressive capabilities. Hardy never again turned to novels to  encourage “the growth of social sympathies” (Hardy, preface 289). Queen’s University, Belfast NOTES I am grateful to andrew H. miller and the anonymous readers at Victorian Studies for  their suggestions, and to roger ebbatson for his comments on an earlier presentation  of this material.  1While she does not focus on sympathy, Hyman discusses the general influence  of Comte, stephen, and Huxley (18–26). I would challenge her reading of Jude, however,  in which intellectually advanced characters are assumed to lack “moral feeling” (34).  Discussions of the influence of Darwinian notions of sympathy on Hardy are rare (and  brief): Glendening mentions Tess of the D’Urbervilles (1891) in this context (79–80), while   richardson provides a short discussion of animal sympathy in Far from the Madding  Crowd (63–64). Gagnier offers a wide-ranging discussion of sympathy, but the intention  is less to trace direct lines of influence on Jude than to use the text to discuss the broader  political functions of this concept.  2Hardy was famously contradictory about his influences: while claiming  “harmony” of view with Darwin, Huxley, and spencer, he also claimed to endorse “no  philosophy” and no “single scientific theory.” see Hardy, Life 441; Levine, “Hardy and  Darwin” 36. Huxley’s and spencer’s views on sympathy are particularly difficult to  harmonize. 3stephen’s “Darwinism and Divinity” (reprinted in Essays on Freethinking and  Plainspeaking) is cited in the 1874 revision of the Descent (100, 111, 134).  4Hardy’s position on animal rights is normally treated separately from his  broader approaches to sympathy and ethics: see, for example, preece and morrison.  5all quotations in the text are from Jude 1998. 6In her discussion of The Return of the Native, Gillian Beer notes “an ambiguous  anthropomorphism” in both Darwin and Hardy that “paradoxically denies human  centrality” (235). That paradoxical effect is also produced in the pig killing scene in  Jude. for valuable discussions of nineteenth-century theorizations of animal emotion  in the context of vivisection, see White, “experimental” and “sympathy.”  7on Darwin’s examples of cross-species sympathy, see Descent 126.  8While Hardy read some of stephen’s contributions to Fraser’s in the early  1870s, stephen also recommended Essays on Freethinking to Hardy early in their friend- ship; see maitland 272.  9see, for example, Hardy’s excerpt from the words of a poisoner in octave  feuillet’s novel La Morte: “Virtues . . . are mere instincts, veritable prejudices, which   vICTorIan sTuDIes / voLume 53, no. 4 </page> <page sequence="21"> on sufferInG anD sYmpaTHY 685 nature imposes on us because she needs them for the conservation and the progress of  her work” (Notebooks 1: 1884). 10Jude was conceived in the late 1880s and written between 1892–94. on the  conception and genesis of the novel, see Hardy’s first preface in Jude ed. Ingham, xxxv. 11These articles later formed part of The Principles of Ethics (1892–93). roger  ebbatson provides an interesting analysis of the influence of the early spencer on  Hardy (41–57); as he notes, Hardy is known to have read spencer’s First Principles (1862),  Essays (1865), and Principles of Biology (1865–67), but the notebooks also reveal a broader  engagement with the later spencer via periodical sources; see Hardy, Notebooks 1: 495,  1216, 1221–27, 1328–29.  12see mill’s claim in the conclusion of his essay that humans should not imitate  but should instead strive “to amend the course of nature” (33). Critics who have made a  case for the direct or indirect influence of mill’s essay on Hardy’s thought include Glen- dening 77; morrell 92–94; schweik 54; and Wickens 64–65. as Wickens notes, “on  nature” was published posthumously in 1874 but completed in 1854, prior to the publi- cation of Darwin’s Origin (78n).  13Whether sympathy is a feeling or has a cognitive component continues to be  debated; see ratcliffe 10. 14as millgate notes, the version published in Life uses the draft of the letter,  which in its final form excluded the explicit reference to Darwin’s allusion to this issue  (Public Voice 311).  15The claim that the extension of sympathy toward animals was a sign of moral  progress was also shared by William Lecky and frances power Cobbe; see White,  “sympathy” 10.  16as morrell has noted, Hardy used the symbolism of the unweeded garden in  Tess and Far from the Madding Crowd, a metaphor found in mill’s essay “on nature” and  in Huxley. Huxley seems the most direct influence here, since Evolution and Ethics was  delivered and published while Hardy was writing the novel. 17on Hardy’s engagements with schopenhauer, see Kelly 232–36; schweik 69. 18It is Burke’s notion of sympathy as instinct, rather than his idea that it turns  on pleasure and pain, that seems to have ultimately influenced Darwin in the Descent.  19In quotations from the notebooks, ellipses without parenthetical marks are  Hardy’s own.  20millgate notes this statement was published in both 1917 and 1927 (Hardy,  Public Voice 458). 21on Hardy’s relationship with positivism, see Life 150–51 and the extensive  citations from Comte in Notebooks 1: 618; 640–796. also see Dixon 234–35; Hyman  20–37; and Watts 481.
