<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRED GLASS Sign of the Times: THE COMPUTER AS CHARACTER IN TRON, WAR GAMES, AND SUPERMAN III Introduction As early as 1969 we witnessed the first starring role for a computer character in an American film in 2001: A Space Odyssey. HAL repre- sented as much a new twist on the old theme of techne and revolt as a genuine departure. It relied upon both anthropomorphic conven- tion and an ultimate belief in the superior moral powers of the human heart over cold circuitry's hubris. But a portentous wrinkle has arisen in the old tale in such recent films as TRON, War Games, and Superman III. These films continue to share the major thematic assumptions of their mythic and literary forebears, in particular tapping popu- lar feeling and resentment against the intro- duction of new technologies. But the power of the imagery is enhanced through a changed circumstance: today, the new technology con- tains the ability to destroy not some symbolic representative human character, but all of humanity itself. That's why in these films computers and 'the bomb' appear on neigh- boring pedestals in a modern pantheon of sign and myth. Ironically, the founder of MAGI (Mathe- matical Applications Group, Inc.) was inspired to create the computer graphics program that figured prominently in the visuals of TRON while a nuclear physicist in the mid-sixties.2 This bit of biographical trivia reveals one clue to the success of the film in establishing its hold over the viewer's imagination: the con- fluent relationship between nuclear and micro- chip technologies, embedded not only at the narrative and ideological levels of contempo- rary popular culture, but even in the history of its image-making. Despite their condensed, combined iden- tity, the computer is the star, not the bomb- perhaps because it is easier to accept by the film-going public than direct representations 16 of nuclear holocaust. In any case, out of the real material of widespread social anxiety over new technology, Hollywood screenwriters have fashioned a new standby in their stock ensemble: the computer-as-character. Not so simple as if the character were always pre- sented as a villain, this image or sign is a con- flicted one. At least two distinct aspects of the computer sign must be taken together to spell out its ideological discourse. One side of the picture consists of the inte- gration of computers in society. The burgeon- ing of a popular technical subculture creates familiarity, acceptance, an expanding sense of personal power on the part of those sections of the populace educated or privileged enough to climb aboard. We find the other side in the fear and trembling associated with little- understood productive forces, with the bomb, with our lack of control over these phenom- ena, with the social and economic disruption accompanying the computer technologies' undemocratic introduction into the work- place. Hence, another image: the computer as a hostile force, alien and alienating. The opposing connotations of "computer" -constituting such improbably divergent regions of meaning-disclose the cultural role played by this contradictory image in recent cinema. The computer as character helps to channel our ambivalence toward the new tech- nologies into narrative conflict and mythic resolution. In TRON, War Games, and Super- man III, the social proliferation of computer anxiety is packaged, condensed, transformed, and finally controlled (?) within the benign shape of "family entertainment." How is this accomplished? The computer- as-character follows the same rules as other characters. These include a rhetoric of type, of genre, of motivations and needs of the</page><page sequence="2">plot. Characters do not have to be human, although within most naturalist or realist narrative they obviously are. But animals can be characters, and trees, rocks, or the sky and earth. All that is necessary is that they play by the rules of anthropomorphic convention: they speak (or have the capacity for speech); they think or feel; they have motivations for the actions they undertake or relationships they create with other characters which are more or less recognizable as human traits, e.g., love, loneliness, greed, etc. HAL developed what was to become a staple computer trait: the tension between human-like qualities and its actual, non- human, technological nature. This defining, contradictory quality provided a human-like sign with which we could identify, and within whose dramatic situation we perceive-more or less consciously-a reasonable approxima- tion of our own ambivalent relationship with new technologies as the latter reshape the objects and processes of everyday life around us. TRON TRON takes place within the impossible geography of a mainframe computer's cir- cuitry. The plot and imagery lift generous portions of various quest narratives; allusions to L. Frank Baum and Lewis Carroll abound. So do some of the most impressive special "Light cycles" race across the grid: TRON effects ever created for a film, which make it easier to close one's eyes to the derivative nature of the story and some rather large, distressing holes in its logic. Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges) is a software engineer who has lost a power struggle among executives in a large communications corpo- ration. Dillinger, president of the ENCOM corporation (David Warner), stole Flynn's programs, canned him, and erased the com- puter files that proved Flynn the author. On the basis of these programs Dillinger was made president. However, Dillinger finds himself in turn the blackmailed pawn of the computer's master control program, or MCP, which threatens Dillinger with exposure if he doesn't do the computer's bidding, including helping it gain access to the Pentagon and Kremlin computer memory banks. ("How would you like me to read out the story of how you stole Flynn's programs on the VDTs of the New York Times?") The notion of computer "blackmail" needs no motivation, representing a precise measure of popular fears: the MCP's evil intent is implicit, almost more like a birth defect than character flaw. Exposition would be redundant. With the help of his ex-lover and her new boyfriend (who both still work for the com- pany) Flynn attempts to break into the locked files that prove his innocence and authorship. 17</page><page sequence="3">The computer-HAL-like-observes Flynn at the terminal. It warns Flynn to quit. Flynn, fingers flying at the keyboard, refuses. The computer dematerializes him with a laser gun (ironically designed by his ex-lover) and deposits him within the computer's circuitry. Once inside, Flynn's adventures "through the looking glass/VDT" begin. His search for the MCP leads him through a series of meet- ings with various characters from the outside world transformed into computer creatures, called programs. A massive, animated world unfolds around him, replete with video gladia- tors pitted in combat (shot live action in black- and-white, the frames blown up and hand- painted, and matted against literally hundreds of thousands of computer-generated color images), high-speed chases on "light cycles" (produced in "Synthavision"-see below), and an assortment of hi-tech-looking death machines, all creating a splendidly paranoid environment of enormous scale. This techno- fascist world provides the context for Flynn's ultimate victory over the MCP, whereupon he is able to return to the outside world and ascend to the corporate presidency in place of the deposed Dillinger. Another computer stars in TRON. Were it not for the development of computer-driven graphics imagery over the past decade, TRON's scintillating visuals would have been impossi- ble. Four computer graphics houses combined their talents to create the finished product, utilizing two main methods of new animation processes. MAGI's Synthavision was respon- sible for the motion sequences. This type of computer graphics generation relies upon building the image from three-dimensional shapes pre-existing in the program. Motion is provided by positioning the object in one place, then in the spot desired for X frames later. The program draws in frames in-between. Commands are given through an authoring- level language. Triple I (Information Interna- tional, Inc.) created the more intricately de- tailed images with its Foonly computer. A digital tablet was used to move a carefully drawn image into the computer, its curved surfaces broken down into infinitesimal poly- gonal parts. These were refined with the addi- tion of thousands of pixels, amplifying color and light properties of the image.3 Perhaps the single most stunning sequence 18 in TRON occurs as Flynn is "derezzed" and sent into the ENCOM computer circuitry. A wrenching, high-speed tunnel whirls past us, its finely etched walls outclassing previous animated corridors in Fantastic Voyage and 2001. We break free into a series of computer- generated planes, which set abstract geometric constructions revolving about one another, dissolving through one plane to the next. This narrative bridge, Flynn's passage between worlds, could stand on its own as a demon- stration of state-of-the-art computer-aided cinematic design. (Evidently the film-makers agreed. They use the same sequence again, in reverse, when Flynn re-emerges.) Oddly enough, TRON participates in a genre stretching back to the first silent black-and- white Disney efforts. From the combined live action / animation of the Alice in Cartoonland series to TRON we could trace more than one line of continuity. Beyond the rather eerie parallel of a "normal" person finding her/ himself inside the representative medium of communications of their era, the hens in Alice's Eggplant, egged on by "Little Red Hensky," go on strike against the automation of their egglaying. The specter of technological forces replacing the hens' natural egg-laying rhythms -at a time when Ford's assembly line was revolutionizing industrial methods-was met with animated unrest and revolt by these feathered victims of progress. (Of course, there are a few differences between the earlier and later Disney products. Alice cost $750; TRON, $21 million.) As anthropomorph, the human qualities of the computer MCP in TRON are the negative characteristics of a technocrat; power-hungry, ruled by profit, authoritarian, unscrupulous- the qualities of a modern captain of industry. Unlike earlier capitalists, this one has the functional narrative advantage of literally lacking a heart. Freed from the banal conven- tional naturalism besetting human beings, this character instead lives through the signs of power. The MCP blackmails Dillinger in the outside world, but literally "bends to its will" Dillinger's program look-alike, Sark, with electrical current inside the computer; it de- rezzes Flynn and throws him into its circuits/ jail. It is all reminiscent-at the level of a parable's innuendo-of our worst-fear scen- ario of what could happen in the technical</page><page sequence="4">transformation of society. When we catch glimpses of the MCP "him- self"-I use the male gender because it speaks with a man's voice, resembling nothing so much as the stentorian tones of the imperial Oz-he is huge, a devilish presence whirling within an infernal machine of awesome dimen- sion, a ghostly face plastered inside a dynamo. This power-mad, technological force-truly technology run amok-holds absolute power over life and death of the people in its circuits, or so it believes. In time-honored fashion, the MCP's hubris proves its downfall. The key for resolution of the problems posed by the evil character's mythic power is to humanize it, make it humanly flawed. This sets the stage for the hero to triumph over the machine's ultimately impossible attempts at being human. Flynn shows up the MCP: people can break the control of the computer over their lives, especially if the machine believes itself above moral constraint. The MCP's depiction raises other consid- erations. The antagonistic computer, soon after the story begins, sheds its more conven- tional trappings as individual anthropomor- phic character for the rather expanded possi- bilities as the situation within which the story appears. When Flynn drops into the circuits of the computer, the insides of the beast (Jonah or Pinocchio and the whale?) become the uni- verse with its own internal laws by which Flynn must make his way. Like the world inside the looking glass for Alice, or the dream from which Dorothy awakens in The Wizard of Oz, the rules bear some sort of relationship to those under which we operate in our world. Just what sort bears examining. TRONis quite explicit in detailing the prob- lems generated by large corporations for the people they employ: deadly competition among executives; dehumanization of workers; en- couragement of immoral acts for profit; stif- ling of creativity when it threatens the status quo. The film is considerably less clear about the larger social relations governing these. For instance, the "bad" corporate executive is simply an updated "bad" capitalist of the Frank Capra/Eddy Arnold variety. The prob- lem here, as for liberal directors in Hollywood in the thirties, is not capitalism or the class of capitalists, but the rotten apple that spoils the barrel. Video warrior in TRON However, the latter view is at odds with other hints dropped by TRON along the way. The old designer who founded the company in his garage criticizes Dillinger, saying he was throttling the creativity of the workers with his tight rein, over-concern with security, and exercise of arbitrary authority. By implication there is an indictment of a system that iron- ically, through security requirements deter- mined by competition with other corporations, must repress the creativity that it ostensibly encourages. But points such as these remain hazy, unacknowledged contradictions within the undertow of two overriding ideological currents. First, Flynn operates within the moral para- meters of old-fashioned, individualist free enterprise. Outraged by Dillinger's theft of Flynn's inventions, these parameters are vin- dicated and consecrated by the hero attaining ENCOM'S presidency. The system works, you see, because given unbridled competition- not fixed by "unfair" abuses of power-the cream rises to the surface. The fact that in Adam Smith's original argument the surface referred to that of the market, while in TRON it has become the corporation (shown earlier in the film to stifle free competition) is appar- ently of no account. Or is the problem the corporation? The film fudges here, as it must if it is not to become 19</page><page sequence="5">Sark (David Warner) in TRON an explictly anticorporate statement. The rotten individual, fingered as the villain, takes the heat for corporate social relations. In turn, the evil individual's responsibility is shuffled off, displaced onto another, more evil and powerful villain, the MCP. The computer represents the other ideologi- cal theme, technological determinism. On this territory the essential argument is made for the film's ending (although once again, not explicitly): that technology, not social rela- tionships, makes the world go round. Com- puter anxiety runs interference for the other- wise logical conclusion that not machines, nor bad individuals, but the structure of corporate capitalism is the problem. We should look at the film's end in this light. From the destruction of the MCP inside the computer, we are taken to the roof of a large skyscraper in Los Angeles. Flynn lands in a helicopter, and hustles down into the building. The camera remains on the roof as the light goes from day to night in stop mo- tion, causing the LA street grid to light up, resembling the animated circuitry of the com- puter. Get it? The whole world out there is one big computer, and we're inside. The ending becomes a dazing reversal of great cynicism: Flynn, innocent of this knowl- edge, is shown by the day-become-night, real world-become-computer to be stuck back within the control of the very forces he be- lieves he had defeated, and inevitably so. Con- cluding the film this way is not only com- pletely unsatisfying for the story (what hap- pened to everyone else?) but also for the ideological themes of individual enterprise's reward, supposedly the moral point against 20 the evil MCP and Dillinger. The happy ending is stilted and artificial, true, if Flynn just be- comes president and that's that. It would make sense neither for the resolution of prob- lems set up by the plot nor for the social rela- tionships it calls into question. Tacking on the street-grid/circuit does make sense, though only for resolving the mythic level of the film -and its success on this score is dubious, considering its despairing, deterministic out- look. It is like dream-conflict resolution: not the threads of narrative tied together, nor dramatic structure, but symbols condensed, unified, and relieved of oppositional force. Thus the problematic ending of TRON should be seen not so much as flawed as re- vealing of its assumptions. If the world is becoming a giant computer, twilight descend- ing, this must be measured against the com- puter-as-world that we've just passed through with Jonah / Alice / Dorothy / Flynn, which has been treated with a moral and social critique implicitly applicable to our society, along the lines of "what is right in a technological sys- tem?" TRON proclaims the belief in people over technology at every opportunity ("Do you think the users still exist?" asks one pro- gram of another. "I hope so. I don't want to break out to find a bunch of cold circuits"). But the overall effect of all this verbal protes- tation is undermined by the constant barrage of special effects, within the giant scale of which the humans are fairly well lost to view. Form recapitulates ideology. In the universe inside the computer, the individual is pitted against the massive weight of corporate competition and bureaucratically controlled technology. The reappearance of the characters developed briefly in the outside world in the computer's circuits merely under- scores the allegorical pointers that the "real world" is becoming programmed the same way. The ending judges the outcome of the struggle between Flynn and computer, us and them4-and they win. By the film's end the dominant image is one of a computer anxiety grown to global proportions. As in the para- noid's dream, the external world has become transformed in terms of the internal dream- scape.</page><page sequence="6">War Games In War Games the Joshua computer also mushrooms from character to world scale. But this growth entails some important differ- ences with TRON. Joshua is presented not as evil but naive; the character's dream that threatens to engulf us is melancholia; and the computer's defeat is not-as in TRON- snatched from us at the end due to inevitable march of technology. War Games articulates a liberal humanism (pacifist, antinuclear) which refuses to be undercut by the conflict with technological determinism that runs through both films. War Games provides a clearer illus- tration of the Janus nature of new computer technologies: the split between their useful- ness and out-of-control qualities are divided between two computer characters, the teenage boy David (and his home PC) and the mili- tary's WOPR computer (War Operations Planned Response), also called Joshua. David is a nice upper-middle-class white boy who goes to high school (where he under- achieves) and lives at home with Mom, Dad, dog, and computer. As an underachiever, he is the "perfect target for the Soviets to manip- ulate into espionage," according to one of the FBI agents that arrest him. Actually less malevolent than this, David loves to play video games. Mom deals real estate over the phone at dinner, while Dad has achieved something really unique: buttering corn on the cob by lathering a piece of bread with butter, and then rolling the slice of bread around the corn. Under cover of these wholesome activi- ties, David sneaks a look at a brochure for the latest offering from a video game com- pany. He goes upstairs and instructs his PC to call all the phone numbers in Sunnyvale, California, and log the responses from other computers, so that he may break into the game company's files and play the new game. When he returns to his room with his hyper- athletic friend Jennifer, a half dozen numbers are displayed, waiting for his followup. Jenni- fer asks what the computer is doing; he replies, "It's dialing numbers." There is no confusion here about the computer's place in the scheme of things-it is merely a tool, a thing. One of the numbers refuses David entry to its files. David-who has already proven his hacking abilities by changing Jennifer's and his failing biology grades to passing-is in- trigued. He goes to a couple of hilariously neurotic young techie friends who work in a computer company (shades of "Eckyl and Jeckyl" in Alphaville). They tell him about "backdoors," passwords inserted into pro- grams by their inventors to allow them privi- leged access that even the clients don't know about. David researches the program's inven- tor-making the sidepoint that properly moti- vated, alienated young public school students can be excellent scholars-and discovers enough to realize the password is "Joshua," after the scientist's son, who died with his mother in a car crash. After Joshua displays its opening menu, David chooses to play Global Thermonuclear War. The rest of the plot revolves around the desperate struggle to stop Joshua from play- ing out the game to its deadly conclusion-for the giant NORAD computer doesn't know the difference between game and reality. David and Jennifer go through a series of misadven- tures, fall into tentative adolescent love, elude the bumbling FBI through David's superior hi-tech expertise, and finally teach Joshua an important lesson through analogy with tic- tac-toe: "Strange game," muses the compu- ter, after it decides not to launch nuclear mis- siles after all, "the only winning move is not to play." The character of Joshua is not shown as a technology gone berserk, because it cannot go berserk-it is not a person, even though it is a character (infused with the spirit of its creator's dead son). On the contrary, the problem with Joshua is its completely rational nature, which renders the computer unable to distinguish between its digital reproduction of input from reality and reality itself. The computer's worldview depends on a flawed, technical semiotic, faulty because it is only logical, and not tempered with other, human qualities-in much the same way that the mili- tary, it is inferred, can only see messages from the "other side" through the prism of its own rigid mindset. Two human characters inform the meaning of the Joshua character: Berringer, the four- star general, and Dr. Falken, the scientist who developed it and named it after his dead son. Berringer is self-admittedly old-fashioned. Machines have their place in his picture of 21</page><page sequence="7">things: under the control of people. Yet even he is forced to bend reluctantly before the dictates of the giant computer's readouts- less literally, but as surely as Sark inside the computer in TRON. The inventor is a modified version of the gentle scientist who, horrified with the evil uses to which his gift to humanity has been put, has turned away from war-related re- search and applied his talents to peaceful and natural pursuits. Dr. Falken spends his time constructing and tinkering with model ptero- dactyls-a rather literal image of his own flight from the hi-tech horrors he has helped create. The effects wreaked on Falken's personality through the combination of personal tragedy and social isolation (encouraged by hi-tech work) complements the insight already illus- trated through the two "nerd" characters: that the computer and related technologies seem to be transforming human relationships and personalities-those closest to the vortex run the risk of getting sucked under. While the character of Joshua is essentially conflated with the bomb, the computer is also humanized to a high degree. It talks, calls David on the phone, mistakenly "believing" him to be Dr. Falken (exhibiting signs of a special "felt" relationship with its creator/ father); it wants to play games. By the end of the film Dr. Falken is referring to it uncon- sciously as gendered. Joshua also demonstrates the fearsome ability to turn himself back on after everyone thought the game was over. Falken, the nerds, and others closest to the computer become involved in a strange dialec- tical balancing act. Something of their own humanity has been sacrificed, the price paid in a Faustian bargain with microprocessor technology. While the nerds are just weird, Falken takes a more drastic ground. Showing the kids dinosaur-filled Willis O'Brien out- takes in his living room, he tells them "It's natural for species to become extinct." Buried in his mourning, Falken is quite willing to allow the main difference between his private world and the rest of the world-that every- one else is still alive-to be extinguished: a subtle psychological point scored by the film- makers, as if to say, "Imagine, after a nuclear holocaust, the private tragedy multiplied a billion-fold." Falken's dangerous confusion 22 of internal and external signs and events in his life forms a personal parallel to the similar confusion evidenced by Joshua. Exhibiting a gentle, naive faith in its pro- grammed worldview that nuclear war is there to be waged and won, just like any other com- puter game, Joshua is afflicted with the same blind spot in its circuits as the society that programmed it, its supposed master: an over- developed technology coupled with an under- developed sense of what to use it for. As in TRON, though, the nuances of this computer character are not fully shaded in until consid- ered in relationship with other characters; the child side, for instance, is overshadowed by another aspect, that of nemesis, when Falken's perception and use of Joshua is replaced by General Berringer's. David's home PC is not a character. It remains simply the tool and plaything of a relatively privileged boy, whose environs look like clones of the house, class, and family of Ordinary People. This computer is an exten- sion of David's personality, which is however thereby transformed into a computer-using personality. The adolescent puts his personal technology to adolescent uses. The potentially powerful applications of a computer are chan- neled into "harmless" and trivial uses, even as the boy doesn't know quite what to do with himself as he grows up. Boy and computer represent a microcosm of the more generalized confusion over uses posed by the new tech- nology already evidenced by Falken and Joshua. Given such a teleological vacuum for the cultural absorption of computers, the tech- nology in War Games, by default, moves into the driver's seat. One computer talking with another brings up to date Marx's description of commodity fetishism: "A definite social relation between people takes on the fantastic form of a relation between things." It is sig- nificant that the boy's PC locks into the most prevalent, socially valued (in terms of time, money and extent) use of computing and new technology, the military use. The seemingly autonomous personal computing subculture is linked with the larger social impact of the new technologies as they spread through the military infrastructure. The personal uses of computers, encompassing the possibilities of individual accomplishment and growth for a youth, run up against the question, Will he be</page><page sequence="8">here long enough to learn to use his computer more productively? War Games reiterates the sense of TRON's ending, and clarifies the power of its determi- nistic imagery; the entire globe is indeed simi- lar to the inside of a giant malevolent computer, when the possibility of nuclear war becoming -however briefly, and finally-our macro- environment rests within the fragile circuitry of a Defense Department mainframe. The film's somewhat flimsy claim to realism suc- ceeds in maintaining our suspension of dis- belief due to this entry point into our daily experience, where we live a slightly more mun- dane and repressed version of Flynn's adven- tures in the evil technoworld of TRON, so long as the nuclear computer's plug remains unpulled. David and Jennifer: WAR GAMES Superman III Neither as tightly scripted as War Games, nor, like TRON, filled with dazzling special effects, Superman III develops above its throw- away narrative a far more incisive and radical critique of the relations between people and technology. Its looseness affords the film the room to explore political and social issues relating to the computer revolution without seeming to, within the protective cover of our comic-book expectations. Raggedly assembled beneath the surface of the two main charac- ters, Superman and Augustus Gordon, runs a reasonably sharp assessment of the effects of new technology on the lives of various sorts of people in their social niches. Evil capitalist Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) wants to eliminate the competition to one of his multinational corporation's enterprises, coffee. A newly hired programmer (Richard Pryor) is, Webster learns, a computer genius. The capitalist blackmails him into writing a program that causes a weather satellite to create weather in order to ruin the coffee crop in Bolivia. When Superman intervenes, Web- ster realizes he stands in the way of his grand plan. He has the programmer, Augustus Gor- don, design a supercomputer capable of kill- ing Superman. Gus has qualms-both moral and fear that it won't work-but is coerced by the blackmail threat and seduced by the tech- nical challenge of creating the supercomputer. Before the computer is finished, however, Gus has another computer design synthetic kryptonite, and exposes Superman with it. It doesn't kill Superman, but does turn him into a Jekyll and Hyde: he nearly rapes Lana Lang; people die because he arrives late at a disaster; in order to sleep with Webster's kept mistress, Lorelei, he punches a hole in an oil tanker, spilling its contents into the sea; and he ends up in a bar, filled with booze and self- hatred. He melts his own image in the bar- room mirror with a blast of heat-vision, and rushes out to do battle-with himself. His good and evil sides split apart, and in a junk- yard, surrounded by the rusting remnants of older, used-up technologies, Clark Kent and the evil Superman struggle until the evil side is vanquished, and the effects of the synthetic kryptonite purged. Meanwhile Webster's supercomputer is completed, equipped with exotic military hardware (including a "real" kryptonite ray and an MX missile-the obligatory link with nuclear fears). Superman is lured into battle; he survives the confrontation through the intervention of Gus, who unplugs his creation, allowing Superman to escape. But then the computer turns itself back on. In perhaps the single most horrifying scene of any of these films, the runaway computer, after draining the Atlantic seaboard of its electrical power, enfolds Webster's equally evil sister in its 23</page><page sequence="9">circuits and transforms her into a hideous, microprocessed Elsa Lanchester. Using her as its tool, the computer pins Webster, Lorelei, and Gus to the walls with bolts of energy until Superman returns and finally defeats it. Consistently, throughout Superman III, things and people are not what they seem. Doubling of characters abounds. In the cases of Superman and Gordon, the doubling ex- plicitly involves their relationship with tech- nology. Other dual characterizations score their points, however, also. For instance, Lorelie, a caricatured dumb blonde, is seen reading Kant in one scene-she quickly stuffs the book under a mattress when Webster un- expectedly returns. Her secret identity allows her to live-briefly-outside her alienated condition as kept woman of the capitalist. However, she knows better than to step out- side her socially assigned role if she wants to maintain the style of living to which she has become accustomed. The desire for wealth and power is Gus's moral Achilles' heel, too; as with Lorelei, it is responsible for his toadying to Webster. The character of Gus is layered with contradic- tions, and is easily the most ambitious and complexly written in the film. It overreaches, but Pryor does an excellent job attempting to pull off its various purposes. It is through his populist-constructed eyes that we view com- puter technology in Superman III. An improbable "little guy" character, to match the improbability of Superman, we meet Gus standing in an unemployment line. Informed his benefits have run out, his eye is caught by a matchbook advertisement for a computer school. Here he rapidly discovers he can do things that, according to his teacher, cannot be done with a computer: he is a com- puter genius. Gus's situation represents the fantasy for everyone who, unlike the kids in War Games, really are "ordinary people," and therefore don't have the means to buy an IBM PC for their very own, nor the education to leap across the technology gap from video game parlors to systems analysis. Compare with Flynn in TRON after he's sacked: you can believe white, young, educated Flynn as entrepreneur, opening his own video-game palace. Unskilled, unemployed, middle-aged Gus as the man who designs the world's most powerful com- 24 puter on scraps of paper and the backs of gum wrappers? Why not-black Horatio Alger in the computer era-just as Superman himself is a why not. Like David in War Games, Gus is a com- puter-user who tampers with powers beyond his ken. In increasing steps he is entranced by the promise of shortcuts to wealth and power, and then pays the price. But Gus's is the mun- dane hubris of a working-class hero. His gran- diose schemes are constantly checked by the real power of Webster, who like capitalists everywhere hold blackmail of one sort or another over the heads of their workers to keep them in line. For Webster, Gus is a tool; he uses Gus in exactly the same way that the supercomputer is to be used: in pursuit of his dream of economic domination. The com- puter's neutral potential is channeled toward evil not by its maker, but through the designs of the holder of the pursestrings behind the inventor. Once more, the comparison with TRON is helpful. For all the contortions of Superman IIIs logic, and all the mythic over- lays across the narrative, it remains clear- sighted on the score of who holds real power, and is therefore able to offer the relationship, including blackmail, of Webster/Gordon/ computer against that of Dillinger/MCP. As a consequence, in Superman III the computer-if fantastic-is not made cuddly or imperial. While in TRON and War Games the computers are anthropomorphic, here it is simply a death machine, bearing closer resem- blance to a Star Wars battle cruiser than teddy-bear Joshua or Oz-like MCP. The social anxiety about control over technology running as a thread through all three films also has a different dynamic in Superman III because of the Superman character, who takes over one of the functions of the computer-as- character-the blurring of human and ma- chine qualities-albeit in reverse. The function of the hero character has re- mained essentially unchanged since Gilga- mesh. As a force for social identification, the mythic hero almost always embodies perfor- mance of essential social tasks, prefiguring their accomplishment. Superman represents the personification of technical power applied to what are perceived as socially necessary ends. (It is no coincidence that the appear- ance of Superman in the late thirties took</page><page sequence="10">place against the backdrop of emergence from the Great Depression through an unprece- dented scale of war production.) However, in his latest incarnation, in Superman III, the character is strangely conflicted, and his inter- personal relations-whether as Clark Kent or Superman-tend to come as a deflating shock to the sign traditionally known as "Superman." Whenever this embodiment of social and technological forces becomes a mere human figure with emotions, sexuality, human frail- ties, etc., the believability of the other, mythic side of his character comes under strain. In Superman III this tendency has been brought forward, called to our attention, through the portrayal of Clark as even more a bumbler than usual. When Superman is not being super, we (like him) are quite aware that he is really someone else: something like an aliena- tion effect is produced, which reinforces that other, customarily repressed awareness that we are watching a film. The narrative asks us to bounce back and forth between accep- tance of mythic, technological powers in a human package, and the redefinition of this character as fallible, mortal, and nonmythic. It is a tall order, and one way the film- makers (Richard Lester directed, from a script by David and Leslie Newman) manage a solu- tion is to play the film for laughs, exaggerat- ing and distorting the already hard-to-swallow aspects of the story, characters, and situa- tions. Winks are thrown in the audience's path, Christopher Reeves, the actor, essen- tially saying to us, "Isn't this silly-you and I know that I'm super/not super." Yet there remains in Superman III a core of realism- through Gus's situation, ideologically articu- lated with real social processes-that asks us not to laugh the entire time; and to laugh at the real social situations that the film depicts absurdly. From Pryor's first moments at the com- puter school, a parallel arises with Superman's impossible feats, and with the wish-fulfillment of a dream about accomplishing some diffi- cult and new activity or task in one's life. This particular dream taps a deep social root today: the belief held by millions of computer-illiter- ate Americans that knowledge of computers is a ticket to jobs, money, power-especially the power felt to be the computers' (but which SUPERMAN III in the absence of direct experience controlling computers can only be imagined). The clarity of Superman IIPs social vision falls down here: far from dispelling the vagueness of this sense about computers, it actively contributes to the confusion. Not in its depiction of the computer's capacities, which is generally better than that of the other films, but in what it takes to become a genuine master of the microchip. The work of moving from illiterate to technical expert is glossed over with Gus's utopian leap. Of course, the ease of the pro- cess is also its appeal. The parallel is drawn between Gus and Superman in a loose but consistent way through- out. Gus doesn't want to kill Superman. Yet, fascinated by the technology he magically knows how to control, he goes ahead and designs a super computer, the purpose of which is to kill Superman. Then again, when Super- man is caught in the deadly kryptonite ray, Gus pulls the plug on his beloved creation to help him escape. He is of two minds about his relationship with the technology, acting out his ambivalent feelings in contradictory impulses. Superman, as the personification of techno- logical power, literalizes his own ambivalence for us. The curious scene in the junkyard-a latter-day battle of Titans-capsulizes the predicament facing Superman: is he a man using his technical powers to help people, or 25 .. . .... - " , "' ,.- .

Superman's dilemma recapitulates Gus's struggle, and provides an alternative to Webster, who unambiguously considers technology his means toward per- sonal aggrandizement and power over others. Although it is as little concerned with natur- alistic representation as TRONor War Games, Superman III actually reflects a more accurate sense of computers and their place in society. In fact, the film's relative clarity of perspec- tive depends on its cartoon-like structure: relying on broad strokes instead of attention to detail, Superman III gets away with slipping a savagely anticapitalist message into "family entertainment." Because the film foregrounds its mythic structure through the Superman figure, the other characters can be dealt with as cardboard cut-outs, too: good girl, bad girl, evil capitalist, wish-fulfillment-all fit snugly within the brightly painted canvas sur- rounding the superhero. And each can then be explored for its own contradictory, mythic qualities. Lorelei hovers between parody of the fifties blonde bombshell and (the Kant scene) addressing our assumptions about her as character in order to undermine them. Webster is so happy about being so evil that we know he's the villain before he opens his mouth. Gus is something different, fitting no pre- fabricated Hollywood type. His character 26 works through playing off roles, one against another, as the occasion demands, from down- and-out screw-up, to Stepin Fetchit when Webster turns up the heat, to modern hi-tech success story. His relationship with computers, while no more fantastic than Flynn's in TRON, is at the same time far more hopeful in its suggestion that the "little guy" might be able to grow in personal and social power through control over computing-a limited perspec- tive, to be sure, but one nowhere to be found in the gaudier, less broadly social visions of people caught in the matrix of new technology presented by the other films. Concluding Notes I would like to summarize my theoretical approach to these three films. My point of departure was that the computer-as-character represented, mutatis mutandis, a structural, common element of each narrative. It served a similar purpose in terms of plot, point of address for its audience, and referred to roughly the same set of ideological assumptions- although the stance of each film in relation to this set of assumptions differed, the com- mon terrain on which the differences were expressed remained that of technological determinism. Despite the often spectacular visual appearance of the films, I concentrated on developing the analysis elsewhere, focusing</page><page sequence="12">on the relationship between the narrative sig- nifier and the mostly unspoken ideological signified. There are two reasons for this approach. First, I find it more interesting. The ques- tion, why has the computer suddenly become a stock character? becomes on reflection various others, including: Why has the char- acter been constituted as a threat? What are the mediations between the "computer revo- lution" and the images that "Hollywood" (generic) produces referring to it? What are the moral issues that have attached themselves to use of new technologies, and how are they explored in the cinema? Each film posed these questions differently, but the differences mostly revealed the film-makers' decision to resolve them at the level of myth. Hence, it seemed necessary to analyze the films at this level. Second, although the special-effects images of each film could undoubtedly have been minutely dissected for the revelation of stylis- tic characteristics peculiar to each, the simple fact is that the image work of computer- assisted film-making is in its historical in- fancy, and the techniques have not yet been tamed to the point where they are used for anything besides the spectacular. Thus in the eighties we are witness to a mono-semic image: the "hi-tech look," the processed mega-frame. Here the image circles back to the same place as the narrative it embodies. Computer technology is being embedded in all three levels in film-making practice: formal/techni- cal, narrative, and ideological. There is an unusually tight fit in these films between the three levels of film experience, due to the his- torical conjuncture. The more things change . . . A new set of visual expectations is being constructed around the old kernel, what does a film look like? The generation growing up with Star Wars expects different images than those who cut their eye teeth on Buck Rogers. But the loaded nature of the issues addressed by the computer films-questions such as the survival of our species, mediated through the computer filter -seem to have resulted in some things remain- ing the same, e.g., the reduction of the ideo- logical theme to mythic status. All ideologies are not mythic. However, all myths are ideological. Myth is a particular form of ideological expression, called into modern usage when the questions are so hot there appears to be no other way to handle them except through the bundling of oppo- sites-good / evil, life / death, ruler / ruled, human/machine-that has assisted in the pro- cess since the time when only faces and flames surrounded by darkness served for visual accompaniment. The hi-tech look would in this sense remain an embellishment, extrane- ous or coincidental to discussion of the issues attached to the computer-as-character, were it not for its creeping movement toward incor- poration in that ever-receding horizon, the language of cinema. Perhaps its significance will turn out to be that it managed, for a time, to restate formally the conflicts addressed in the narrative and ideological levels of expen- sive mass market movies at a moment when only the wealthy could afford to do so. In any event, by living through films in which giant computers "die" or are defeated in their nasty designs, we survive more than a couple hours before the screen. We survive -or come to believe we can or will make it through-the onslaught of the computer revo- lution. Unfortunately, the catharsis' relief- if that is indeed what we are getting-is short. For most of us the new technologies represent something quite outside our control. This common subjectivity lays us open to the sub- terranean work performed by the computer- as-character. Until that power relationship is transformed, we won't see the last of the image that expresses it. NOTES 1. Godard's Alphaville predates the American films by several years, and anticipates their themes. Also, I understand that The Demon Seed-which I haven't seen-explores similar terrain. 2.
