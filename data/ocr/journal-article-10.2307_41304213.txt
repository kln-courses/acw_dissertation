In this sense, any text is a part of a cultural continuum that extends to the very beginnings of humankind. It is, however, anything but easy to trace that continuum, and not just because most of the links are usually missing. An even greater impediment is the uncer- tainty that inevitably surrounds the nature of the relationship between two texts that display what look like parallels. No matter how convincing, these do not nec- essarily attest to a genetic connection by way of conscious or unconscious mime- sis, as the possibility of both compositions drawing from the same diffuse pool of motifs, tropes, concepts, and thought patterns should also be seriously considered, and even accidental convergence cannot be discounted. Further complicating the picture, parallels often point in several directions, sometimes toward texts com- posed in different languages and belonging to different cultures. Since the relative dating of ancient texts - and accordingly the mimetic vector - may likewise be inde- We would like to thank two anonymous JBL reviewers for their helpful comments on this article.

Its texts have been massively absorbed and transformed in Western culture, and more recently beyond it, but until this culture began rediscovering the oeuvres of ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Hittite, Ugaritic, and other literatures, no one could even suspect that the Hebrew Bible may in its turn have absorbed and transformed many of them. Multiple parallels traced between these literatures and the biblical corpus would seem to indicate as much; but what is the import of these parallels? Which of them can be plausibly interpreted as suggesting that the Hebrew Bible mimics an antecedent composi- tion and thus serves as a link between it and modernity? And what exactly are these antecedents? Apart from a few relatively clear-cut cases, the aforementioned uncer- tainties make these questions difficult to answer. A promising way out of the impasse is offered by the approach developed by NT scholar Dennis R. MacDonald about a decade ago. He formulated six criteria against which to check whether a certain composition imitates another: The criterion of accessibility, or availability, assesses the likeliness that the author had access to the hypotext. The more widespread the proposed target of imita- tion, the stronger the case for imitation The second criterion, analogy, seeks to place the proposed . . . parallels within a tradition of imitations of the same model. The more often ancient authors imi- tated a particular story, characterization, or plot element, the more likely the case that [the studied text] did too Density, criterion three, pertains to the volume of contacts between two texts The fourth criterion, order, is related to density insofar as it assesses the sequence of the parallels. The more often two texts share content in the same order, the stronger the case for literary dependence. The fifth criterion is distinctiveness. Occasionally two texts contain distinguish- ing characteristics, such as peculiar characterizations, or a sudden, unexpected change of venue, or an unusual word or phrase The final criterion is interpretability, or intelligibility, the capacity of the pro- posed hypotext to make sense of the hypertext. This may include the solution to a peculiar problem that has eluded other explanations. It also may include emu- lation, or transvaluation 3 2 This is not to say that only mimetic parallels are valuable. Ultimately, it is the audiences prerogative to attach significance to any connection it sees between the texts. However, knowing that mimesis may plausibly be involved brings out an aspect of meaning that is not available otherwise. 3 MacDonald, The Homeric Epics and the Gospel of Mark (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000), 8-9; see also idem, Does the New Testament Imitate Homer ?

Modern scholars mostly highlight the parallels between this account and single-combat scenes in the Iliad.4 Moreover, two relatively recent publications interpret the parallels in question in terms of a mimetic process in which the biblical hypertext emerged at least partly in response to the Homeric hypotext.5 Over against this tendency, we argue that the narrative of the expedition against Humbaba/Huwawa in The Epic of Gilgamesh (SBV II-V) and the duel scene from an ancient Egyptian text commonly known as The Story of Sinuhe better qualify as the chapters hypotexts.6 We shall proceed by applying MacDonald s criteria to Homeric and ancient Near Eastern parallels trace- able in 1 Samuel 17 and comparing the results. I. Hector, Ajax, Paris, and Menelaus A . Availability Imitation of a text obviously requires physical access to it and a degree of com- petency in its language. Moreover, with the criterion of interpretability in mind, the author of the newly created composition has to be reasonably sure that the same is true of his or her intended audience.7 If so, in order to argue that 1 Samuel 17 imi- tates the Iliad , it is necessary to demonstrate that at the time when the biblical chap- ter could conceivably have come into existence some Jews/Israelites were, or at least could have been (1) in possession of Homer scrolls and (2) sufficiently literate in 4 E.g., Cyrus Gordon, "Homer and Bible: The Origin and Character of East Mediterranean Literature," HUCA 26 (1955): 87; Alexander Rofe, "The Battle of David and Goliath: Folklore, Theology, Eschatology," in Judaic Perspectives on Ancient Israel (ed.

The appropriate part of The Story of Sinuhe can be found in its entirety in COS 1:79. 7 Of course, mimesis does not necessarily assume the listeners' or readers' familiarity with the hypotext, but when intertextuality does not exist as far as the target audience is concerned, a genetic link between two given texts becomes considerably more difficult to prove.</page><page sequence="4">454 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 3 (201 1) Greek to detect and appreciate (not to mention create) an imitation of his opus. Both propositions appear dubious. Following M. I. Finley s estimate, "if a Greek owned any books ... he was almost as likely to own the Iliad and Odyssey as anything from the rest of Greek lit- erature," circulation of Homer can be roughly correlated with the spread of seden- tary Greek population.8 Greeks probably arrived in Syro- Palestine already in the seventh century b.c.e., but their settlement was limited to coastal locations, such as "Acco, Dor, Jaffa, Tell Jemmeh, and Ashkelon."9 One of these locations, Mezad Hashavyahu, has yielded both Hebrew inscriptions and Greek pottery, suggesting coexistence of Judean and Hellenic populations.10 However, the site existed only briefly (in Alexander Fantalkins estimate, no more than five years), probably under short-lived Egyptian administration in the late seventh century b.c.e.11 Farther inland, where the Israelite heartland was located, there is no attestation of consis- tent, substantial Greek presence. Yohanan Aharoni, the excavator of Tell Arad, iden- tified the DTD mentioned on several ostraca from the site as Greek mercenaries hired by a king of Judah, but, as pointed out by Ephraim Stern, it is not even clear from the inscriptions that these people were permanent residents of the place.12 The picture did not substantially change in the Persian period, with archaeo- logical data pointing to Greek presence along the entire Mediterranean coast of Syro-Palestine but not in the inland areas.13 This pattern is consistent with those of Greek colonization elsewhere.14 Overall, it would appear that until Alexanders con- quests the Israelites/Jews never lived side by side with the Greeks.

Mastering a foreign language, especially one using an unfamiliar system of writing, has always involved substantial investments of effort, time, and money. Even today, language classes are usually taken for a clearly defined practical pur- pose, and there is little doubt that ancient Israelite/Jewish scribes were trained to read and write in a foreign language only if their sponsor could put the skill to a good use, usually by having the trainee conduct correspondence in that language. If so, reading proficiency in Homeric Greek would amount to an unaffordable lux- ury for even the wealthiest and most educated Israelites/Jews (especially in the harsh postexilic conditions) unless their government was in regular, direct com- munication with that of a predominantly Greek- speaking entity. Such communi- cation is not only unattested but also highly unlikely, both before the exile and in the Persian period. The largely landlocked kingdoms of Israel and Judah and the completely landlocked postexilic Jewish community could contact the core Greek areas across the Mediterranean only through the mediation of seafaring coastal dwellers, Phoenicians or Philistines, who spoke Western Semitic languages. As to the Greek population of the region proper, it was not large enough for its mother tongue to enter official use or become a lingua franca even on a local scale.16 Azzan Yadin emphasizes the suggestion of Joseph Naveh that, "in the seventh century b.c. there was in Philistia a national awakening, some search for the non- Semitic roots."17 However, the evidence cited by Naveh falls short of suggesting that at some point Greek became the Philistines written language of choice (which could in turn stir at least some interest in it among their Israelite neighbors). Not only is this evidence purely onomastic and therefore patently unreliable as far as ethnic and even linguistic identities are concerned, but the very inscriptions possibly con- taining the Greek names are written in a Semitic language and use a modified Hebrew script.18 In sum, chances are that before Alexander the Israelites/Jews had neither access to Homer nor a motive to master written Greek. (A few could, of course, pick up some of the vernacular used by Greek colonists, but that would hardly suf- 15 Herodotus never mentions the Jews in his writings; given his erudition, this may be an additional indication that even in the fifth century Greco-Jewish interaction was minimal. 16 According to Stern, Greek settlers were a minority everywhere in the region ("Begin- ning," 120). 17 Joseph Naveh, "Achish-Ikausu in the Light of the Ekron Dedication," BASOR 310 (1998): 35-37. 18 Seymour Gitin, Trude Dothan, and Joseph Naveh, "A Royal Dedicatory Inscription from Ekron," IE/47 (1997): 1-16; Naveh, "Writing and Scripts in Seventh-Century B.C.E.

To be sure, the situation would dras- tically change in the Hellenistic period, when Greek became the language of the imperial administration and Greek-based culture, with the Iliad and the Odyssey as its flagships, swept the Near East. However, there is no compelling warrant to believe that 1 Samuel 17 is Hellenistic. Yadin and Israel Finkelstein assign it to the late seventh or sixth century b.c.e., and Alexander Rofe, who argues that some of the chapter s features are relatively late, places it in the latter part of the Persian period.19 Even the scholars who generally tend to date biblical texts as late as pos- sible heavily favor this period as the sociohistorical background of the Former Prophets, including 1 Samuel 17. 20 The chapter is thus relatively unlikely to hail from the time when its creators would be most likely to have access to Homer and be able to read him; accordingly, the hypothesis that 1 Samuel 17 imitates the Iliad fails the test of availability. B. Analogy To the best of our knowledge, no one has so far convincingly demonstrated, or even tried to trace, imitation of the Iliad or the Odyssey in the Hebrew Bible apart from 1 Samuel 17. On the contrary, most publications that discuss parallels between the two corpora (n. 4 above) either deny a genetic relationship between them or even suggest that Homer imitates the Hebrew Bible or (more likely) its Mesopotamian and Egyptian antecedents- which appears plausible in view of numerous parallels between Homer and ancient Near Eastern texts that clearly pre- date him.21 With no analogies to it, alleged Homeric mimesis in 1 Samuel 17 pre- sents itself as a unique and therefore improbable phenomenon.22 C. Density MacDonald explains that "density is determined by bulk, not by count; paral- lels between two texts may be numerous but trivial On the other hand, as few 19 Rofe, "Battle," 128-31. 20 E.g., Philip R. Davies, In Search of "Ancient Israel" (JSOTSup 148; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992), 75-133. 21 West speaks about "the Greek poets' debts to Near Eastern traditions" ( East Face , 624; note also the subtitle of his book), while Miller declares that "for the most part the parallels stud- ied in [Miller s] book are of Semitic origin and were adopted and adapted in Greece" ( Western Par- adise, 105). Theresa Carp treats putative parallels between 1 Samuel 28 and the necromantic scene in Odyssey 1 1 in typological rather than genetic terms ("Teiresias, Samuel, and the Way Home," California Studies in Classical Antiquity 12 [1979]: 65-76). 22 Admittedly, the criterion of analogy cannot be decisive because otherwise the exegetes may find themselves in a catch-22 situation: if any individual case of suspected mimesis can be dis- counted simply because there is no analogy, there will never be an analogy. Nevertheless, the cri- terion in question can and should be considered alongside other factors.</page><page sequence="7">Frolov and Wright: Intertextuality in 1 Samuel 1 7 457 as two or three weighty similarities may suffice."23 From this standpoint, Yadins claim that "David and Goliath engage in a contest of champions, a (/.ovo^axfa, a form of battle known exclusively from the Greek epic tradition" is of utmost impor- tance with regard to the "density" of Homeric parallels in 1 Samuel 17. 24 This claim is false on two interrelated counts. First, although single combat is indeed common in the Iliad (which may have more to do with its start-to-finish battleground setting than with an exclusively Greek or Homeric mind-set), it is attested also in ancient Near Eastern literature, including the Hebrew Bible. Readily available examples include the clash of gods in Enuma Elish (with Marduk explicitly challenging Tiamat to a "single combat"), Sinuhe and the anonymous "mighty man of Retenu" in The Story ofSinuhe (hence- forth the Story), and twelve pairs of contestants in 2 Sam 2:14-16. All these duels, just like those in the Iliad and 1 Samuel 17, take place in the course of a military campaign, with the combatants representing the warring sides, but not as a part of a general battle.25 Second, Homeric single combat is of a somewhat different type than the one described in 1 Samuel 17. In the Iliad, one-on-one martial contests take place in the course of a war and do not tangibly influence its outcome. In 1 Samuel 17, Goliath challenges the Israelites to a single combat in lieu of a war , with the battles out- come exclusively deciding which side emerges victorious and gains ascendancy (w. 8-9). Nothing less than the nations independence is wagered here - in a sharp contrast, for example, to the inconsequential stakes in the battle between Hector and Ajax, which do not extend beyond the losers gear and boasting rights ( Iliad 7.77-91). Yadin cites the single combat between Paris and Menelaus in Iliad 3 as "a battle of champions with national consequences," but it is not exactly that.26 The prize of this combat is "Helen with all her goods" (e.g., 3.281-91) rather than Troy or Greece; it would have ended the war (were it not for the inconclusive outcome) not by winning it for one of the sides but by removing the reason for fighting (e.g., 3.94). The fact that both David and Homeric characters engage in single combat consequently does not go a long way in turning the intertextual compass of 1 Samuel 17 in the direction of the Iliad. Likewise contestable is Yadins assertion that the detailed description of Goliaths weapons and armor in 1 Sam 17:5-7 is meant to evoke Homer.27 First, although within the confines of the Hebrew Bible this description is indeed sui generis , this is not exactly the case in the broader ancient Near Eastern literary con- text. The Epic of Gilgamesh (henceforth the Epic) lists Gilgameshs and Enkidu s 23 MacDonald, Homeric Epics , 8. 24 Yadin, "Goliaths Armor," 379. 25 Yadins refusal to see these martial encounters as single combat ("Goliath's Armor," 380) is therefore unwarranted. 26 Yadin, "Goliaths Armor," 388 n. 67; likewise Finkelstein, "Philistines," 146. 27 Yadin, "Goliaths Armor," 380, 390-95; cf. Margalith, Sea Peoples, 55-56; Brown, Israel and Hellas, 1:163-67.</page><page sequence="8">458 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 3 (201 1) weapons, including swords and two types of axes (SBV II vi; OBV III iv); one ver- sion also mentions their belts (SBV II vi), and a Sumerian precursor to the Epic , Gil- gamesh and the Land of the Living , refers in passing to the title characters armor.28 Likewise, the Story , terse as it is, enumerates the antagonists weapons, as does Enuma Elish with regard to Marduk.29 Second, Goliaths gear is not exactly Homeric or even Greek: Finkelstein concedes that two out of six items enumerated in 1 Sam 17:5-7 - scale armor and shield carried by a shield-bearer- are of Mesopotamian rather than Greek origin.30 He speculates that Greek mercenaries in the seventh- century Egyptian army could adopt these elements; however, even if true this would imply that the author of 1 Samuel 17 was describing a typical contemporary hoplite rather than imitating Homer.31 Third, highly distinctive references to the weight of Goliath s armor and spearhead (w. 5, 7) are unparalleled in Homer. As to more specific details shared by 1 Samuel 17 with the Iliad , most of them are integral to the concept of single combat and therefore could not fail to appear in any text depicting it: for example, such combat would be unthinkable without one side throwing down the gauntlet and another picking it up. One notable excep- tion is the explicit oral formulation of the duels conditions by the challenging side (1 Sam 17:8-10; Iliad 7.77-86 and elsewhere); another is the dismay initially caused by the challenge (1 Sam 17:11; Iliad 7.92-93, 151).32 We can note therefore that uniquely Homeric parallels in 1 Samuel 17 include two details of limited "heft." D. Order Finkelstein maintains, following West, that the sequence of events in 1 Samuel 17 approximates that in the battle between Hector and Ajax {Iliad 7): "a hero is 28 ANET, 49. 29 Ibid., 66. 30 Finkelstein, "Philistines," 145-46. 31 Even more likely, the chapter simply throws together culturally disparate elements intended to impress the audience, together with Goliath's gigantic stature (see II.C below); thus Kurt Galling, "Goliath und seine Riistung," in Volume du Congres: Geneve 1965 (VTSup 15; Lei- den: Brill, 1966), 150-69; Rofe, "Battle," 132. Above all, this is suggested by his all-bronze protec- tive gear; thus described, on a sunny day he would cut a supremely intimidating figure, towering as well as glowing. 32 West also points out that in both 1 Sam 17:52 and Iliad 1 1.756-58 the losing side is pur- sued up to a specific point (East Face , 376). However, precise geographic delimitation of such a pursuit is so common in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Num 14:45; Josh 10:10; Judg 4:16; 1 Sam 7:11; 14:31; 15:7; 2 Sam 5:25) as to amount to a cliche, which devalues it as a parallel. Yadin compares David trying on Sauls combat gear in 1 Sam 17:38-39 to Patroclus wearing that of Achilles in Iliad 16 ("Goliath's Armor," 390-91). The parallel founders on vast differences between the cir- cumstances under which it happens. Patroclus prepares to join a general battle, not to participate in one-on-one combat, and asks for Achilles' armor not because he does not have his own (which is the case with David) but in order to rally the Achaeans by creating a false impression that Achilles has rejoined them.</page><page sequence="9">Frolov and Wright: Intertextuality in 1 Samuel 17 459 challenged; his people react in horror; the hero accepts the challenge; the arms of the heroes are described; the combatants give speeches; the fight begins; the chal- lenger is defeated."33 Yet, for the most part this sequence simply could not be dif- ferent. Challenge is to be issued before it is accepted and the fight begins. Exchange of taunts or threats makes perfect sense before the exchange of blows but little or none after it (when one of the combatants may well be dead). And, of course, the challenger can suffer defeat only at the very end (not to mention that Hector, unlike Goliath, does not die at Ajaxs hand and technically is not even defeated: the duel is stopped before the swords are drawn, 7.273-83). Where divergence is possible, 1 Samuel 17 does differ from Iliad 7: thus, Goliath s equipment is described (w. 5- 7) before he addresses the Israelite camp (w. 8-10). Neither does the course of the battle proper correspond to Homeric patterns: whereas in the Iliad several strikes are usually exchanged, David knocks Goliath out in one fell swoop.34 Preparations for the combat and its aftermath in the Hebrew Bible also do not seem to follow any Homeric models. Dissimilarity is even greater with regard to the literary context of the single- combat scenes. As already mentioned, in the Iliad single combat has little, if any, impact on the broader plot, with each one-on-one battle functioning as a largely self-contained vignette. Not so in 1 Samuel, where triumph over Goliath stands out as a pivotal event that shapes much, if not all, of what happens to David thereafter, up to and including his ascension to the throne in 2 Samuel 2-5. More specifically, the battle jump-starts Davids military career (1 Sam 18:5), makes him popular (18:5-7, 16, 30), launches the friendship with Jonathan (18:1-4), and gives rise to Sauls envy and suspicion (18:8-9). Neither the internal layout of 1 Samuel 17 nor its function in the literary context, then, matches those of the chapter s alleged Homeric counterparts. E. Distinctive Features The narrator of 1 Samuel 17 twice refers to Goliath as DT2 UPN, literally "man of in-between" (w. 4, 23). Yadin claims that this term, a hapax legomenon in the Hebrew Bible but attested in Qumran, is here a "caique" of the Greek ^eTcujfliiov, "space between two opposing armies."35 Even if that is correct, the lexeme does not qualify as a distinctive touching point between the biblical text and the Homeric corpus for the simple reason that, as conceded by Yadin, the latter never uses the word tieraixtuov.36 33 Finkelstein, "Philistines," 146. 34 West notes that, like Goliath, Hector is felled with a stone ( East Side , 214), but he fails to mention that Hector is the first to hurl one, albeit to no avail ( Iliad 7.263-67). 35 Yadin, "Goliath's Armor," 380-81. 36 Moreover, in ancient Greek there is no established technical term for "champion" in the sense of "participant of a single combat" (we are grateful to John C. Lamoreaux for his help in</page><page sequence="10">460 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 3 (201 1) Of greater interest is another parallel, pointed out by West and Yadin: Goliaths threat to "give [Davids] flesh to the birds of the sky and to the beasts of the field" (v. 44) somewhat resembles Achilles' promise that "dogs and birds will tear horri- bly" at the slain Hector (Iliad 22.335-36).37 However, an even closer counterpart to this highly recognizable threat can be found in the Epic (see II.E below); conse- quently, no distinctive features of 1 Samuel 1 7 can be confidently identified as Homeric allusions. R Interpretability According to Yadin, 1 Samuel 17 "subverts the heroic conventions of Greek epic" and "so affirms the superiority of Israel over Hellas- a national epic forged in polemic dialogue with a competing national narrative."38 The unspoken presup- position underlying this statement is that the creator of the biblical text viewed Hellas as Israels primary political and cultural rival. With Greeks neither a major- ity of the population nor a dominant power anywhere close to the Israelite/Jewish homeland- as was the case in pre-Hellenistic times when 1 Samuel 17 was likely composed (see I.A above)- this appears unlikely. Why would the biblical authors seek to debunk the martial ethos of a people with which they had little, if any, con- tact and about which they could not care less? Seemingly more plausible is Finkelsteins suggestion that "the duel between David and Goliath- dressed as a Greek hoplite-mercenary, probably the clearest manifestation of Egyptian puissance- could have symbolized the coming clash between Josianic Judah and Egypt of the 26th Dynasty."39 Territorial ambitions of Psammetichus I and Necho II were indeed a threat to the rump seventh-century Israelite state, especially after the downfall of Assyria. However, evoking Egypt through strictly Homeric parallels (neither Goliath nor the side he represents has any Egyptian element) does not look like a reasonable rhetorical strategy, even if Greek hoplites were indeed so central to the Saite military as to become its public face (of which there is no evidence). The audience cannot be expected to grasp a symbol without a "conventional link between its signifier and its denotata," and there is no trace of a "Greek equals Egyptian" convention elsewhere in the Hebrew this matter). Neither is it clear that the biblical DTI WH should be understood as "champion": in the Qumranic War Scroll , 0T3 'WN and DT2 uVt likely mean "skirmishers."

Inter- pretability of the putative parallels between 1 Samuel 17 and the Iliad is therefore questionable at best: as a hypotext of the former, the latter fails to contribute to its meaning. II. Gilgamesh and Sinuhe A. Availability From the late tenth to the late seventh century b.c.e., the West Asian scene was dominated by Assyria; no local political entities in existence over these three hundred years could possibly have avoided extensive contact with it. Accordingly, proficiency in Akkadian - Assyria's vernacular and official language - was a major asset for literate Israelites. And if at least some of them did learn Akkadian, they were likely introduced to the Epic in the process. Judging by numerous extant tablets that betray faltering, highly inexperienced hands, budding Mesopotamian scribes learned their cuneiform by taking dictation of this text, copying it, or try- ing to reproduce it from memory.41 Although there is no direct evidence that the practice was followed in the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, neither is there a com- pelling warrant to believe that it was not, especially with a 1994 find attesting to it in Ugarit.42 A fragmentary tablet from Megiddo further confirms that the Epic was in circulation close to the Israelite home.43 Toward the end of the Assyrian era and especially with the Babylonian takeover in the 610s, Aramaic became the regions lingua franca, but a short time later first some surviving Israelites and then most of them found themselves in Mesopotamia proper, where Akkadian was still widely spoken and used in written documents. The situation is more ambiguous with regard to the Story. Egypt was Israels next-door neighbor and, although much less powerful than Assyria or Babylon, exerted substantial influence on it and on at least two occasions (under Sheshonq I in the second half of the tenth century and Necho II in 609-605 b.c.e.) briefly con- 40 The quotation is from Thomas A.

Biblical and extrabiblical sources report or presuppose political contacts and military cooperation between Israel and Egypt (for example, in an account of the 701 b.c.e. expedition against Judah and its allies, Sennacherib mentions that they "called upon the kings of Egypt" for help).44 Neither could be maintained with- out extensive written correspondence; at the same time, there are reasons to doubt that this correspondence was conducted in hieratics: as attested by the Amarna corpus, in the Late Bronze Age Egypt's Asian vassals corresponded with the pharaohs officials in heavily Canaanized cuneiform Akkadian. Since in the Iron Age the situation could change, it is not entirely clear whether Israelite scribes had the requisite linguistic competency to imitate a composition in Middle Egyptian. But if this was the case, they would likely be familiar with the Story- as suggested by the unusually large number of surviving copies, it was a best- seller of sorts from around 1800 b.c.e. until 1000 b.c.e. at the very earliest.45 There is consequently a good chance that the biblical authors had not only the Epic but also the Story avail- able to them. B. Analogy It is a truism of scholarship that the deluge account in Genesis 6-8 imitates Ut- napishtims narrative in tablet 1 1 of the Epic. The two texts are almost identical in every respect, including such minute details as the sealing of the survivor s vessel with pitch/bitumen (Gen 6:14; SBV XI ii), the release of birds to check whether dry land has appeared (Gen 8:6-12; SBV XI iii), the mountaintop offering after the flood, and Gods or the gods delight at the "pleasant fragrance" of the sacrifice, causing them to forswear further floods (Gen 8:20-22; SBV XI iii-iv). Faithfully reproduced in the monotheistic framework of the Hebrew Bible, the Mesopotamian myth helps it make a uniquely biblical statement that righteous individuals can save not only themselves and their families but also the entire humankind because even when the deity plans wholesale destruction it is prepared to thwart itself for the sake of such individuals (Gen 6:8-9, 18).46 The biblical text, then, clearly engages on at least one occasion not only in close, large-scale imitation of the Epic but also in its emulation; in other words, it uses mimesis in order to convey a new message that is polemically directed against the hypotext. A potential genetic connection between the Hebrew Bible and the Story has been traced by A. Meinhold, who argued that the overall structure of the Joseph 44 ANET, 287. 45 ANET, 18. 46 The Epic does not explain why the gods decided to bring about the deluge but saved Ut- napishtim's family from it. In Atrahasis , an Old Babylonian composition that may be based on the Epic , the chief god Ellil tries to destroy humanity by various means, including a global flood, because they are too noisy and disturb his sleep, but Ea, the wisdom god and designer of human beings, uses the wise Atrahasis to thwart him at every turn (Dalley, Myths , 14-35).</page><page sequence="13">Frolov and Wright: Intertextuality in 1 Samuel 1 7 463 account in Genesis 37; 39-50 is modeled after the latter.47 Tenuous as it is, this anal- ogy may be weightier than the one discussed in the previous paragraph because the Story is much shorter than the Epic and for the most part very terse (the only exceptions are the duel scene that is the focus of the present article and the account of Sinuhe s subsequent return to Egypt). When a composition offers so little mate- rial to work with, even total lack of analogies does not render its imitation implau- sible (see also n. 22 above) and even a hint of an analogy substantially increases the likelihood of mimesis. It should also be noted under this rubric that the Hebrew Bible on occasion uses multiple hypotexts to construct a single hypertext. A possible example of this technique is the "paradise lost" narrative of Genesis 3. No text that is not based on the Hebrew Bible has a wise snake cheat humans out of immortality by tricking the woman into eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge; at the same time, three ancient Mesopotamian compositions display between them all of these conceptual ele- ments. In the Epic, a snake steals the fruit of eternal youth (SBV XI vi); in Adapa , Enki, the god of wisdom, cheats the titular character out of immortality; and The Huluppu-tree associates a female mythological character with a tree and a "snake who knows no charm."48 Even more salient for our purposes, in some cases the amalgamated hypotexts come from different cultures. Thus, while the Song of Songs shares numerous conceptual and stylistic components with secular love poems of the Egyptian New Kingdom, some of the books aspects, such as ubiqui- tous vegetative imagery and celebration of physically consummated passion, rather bring to mind Mesopotamian compositions associated with the goddess Inanna 49 C. Density As explained in I.C above, single combat in 1 Samuel 17 is not exactly of the Homeric type because it determines the outcome of the entire campaign. A much closer parallel is offered by the battle scene in the Story where the conflict between the tribes represented by the title character and the anonymous "mighty man of Retenu" begins and ends with their duel. When Sinuhe wins, the opposing side apparently surrenders, offering no resistance when he plunders their possessions. The single-combat setting of 1 Samuel 17 thus constitutes what MacDonald might term a "bulky" parallel with the Story rather than with the Iliad. The same is true 47 Meinhold, "Die Geschichte des Sinuhe und die alttestamentliche Diasporanovelle ," Wissenschaftliche Zeitschrift der Ernst-Moritz-Arndt Universitat 20 (1971): 277-81. 48 Dalley, Myths , 184-87 (Adapa); Samuel Noah Kramer, The Sumerians: Their History, Cul- ture , and Character (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), 199-202 ( The Huluppu-tree). 49 For the Egyptian love poems, see COS 1:125-30; for the Inanna songs, see COS 1:540-43. Modern scholars for the most part emphasize Egyptian connections of the Song of Songs: see especially Michael V. Fox, The Song of Songs and the Ancient Egyptian Love Songs (Madison: Uni- versity of Wisconsin Press, 1985).</page><page sequence="14">464 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 3 (201 1) of the inventory of Goliaths battle equipment in 1 Sam 17:5-7: by mentioning the weight of his armor and spearhead it evokes the Epic with its references to the weight of Gilgameshs and Enkidus axes, swords, and belts (SBV II vi; OBV III iv) rather than Homer, who makes no such references. Ancient Near Eastern inter- textuality works precisely where Greek connections fail. But it is with regard to the antagonist s physical stature and demeanor that the intertextual vector of 1 Samuel 17 unmistakably points toward an ancient Near Eastern antecedent. Goliath is clearly a giant: he stands "six cubits and a span" (nine feet nine inches, or almost three meters), wears armor that weighs five thousand shekels (126 lb = 57 kg), and wields a spear with a six-hundred- shekel (15 lb = 7 kg) tip (1 Sam 17:4-5, 7).50 This sets him far apart from the combatants of the Iliad, who are presumably of normal human size even when they are partly divine.51 Goliath's enormous stature rather brings to mind Gilgameshs antagonist Humbaba, designed "to be the terror of people" (SBV III v).52 The Epic does not provide Hum- babas exact measurements but says that "[his] shout is the flood-weapon, [his] utterance is Fire, and [his] breath is Death" (SBV II v, vi); since there is no indica- tion of him literally being a fire-breathing creature, this statement is best inter- preted as a metaphorical description of a giant.53 Although often characterized as a monster, Humbaba is definitely anthropomorphic (he is capable of intelligent speech, is bipedal, and has arms and a head) and thus only a step removed from a monstrous three-meter-tall human. Awed by their towering physique, other characters paint Humbaba and Goliath as potent, all-but-invincible warriors; accordingly, both Gilgamesh and David are admonished to banish the thought of confronting them. Gilgameshs announcement of his intention to slay Humbaba meets with strong objections from Enkidu and the elders of Uruk: "Why do you want to do this? Huwawas home is an impossible challenge" (OBV III iii, v).54 Since Gilgamesh remains unconvinced, Enkidu adds, "How can we go to the Cedar Forest? Its keeper, Gilgamesh, is a war- 50 Greek manuscripts (including Codex Vaticanus), Josephus, and probably 4QSama put Goliath's height at "four cubits and a span" (about six feet nine inches, or 206 cm). This reading should be rejected as rationalizing (with David Toshio Tsumura, The First Book of Samuel [NICOT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2007], 440-41, against McCarter, I Samuel 291) and clash- ing with the enormous weight of Goliath's equipment. 51 West (East Face, 370), followed by Finkelstein ("Philistines," 146), claims that Ereuthalion, Nestor's opponent in II 7.132-56, is "characterized as a giant." In fact, Nestor does not go beyond saying that Ereuthalion was "the tallest and strongest man" that he ever slew and mentioning his "huge sprawling bulk" (7.155-56). This does not necessarily mean that Ereuthalion's physique was extraordinary, and in any case, unlike Goliath's stature, it is barely mentioned in the account. 52 Dalley, Myths , 62, 145. 53 Ibid., 61, 63. 54 Ibid., 143. ANET translates, "An unequal struggle is tangling with Huwawa" (p. 79).</page><page sequence="15">Frolov and Wright: Intertextuality in 1 Samuel 17 465 rior. He is mighty, never resting" (OBV III iii).55 When David volunteers to respond to Goliath's challenge, Saul reacts in a similar way: "You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are but a youth, and he a man of war since his youth" (1 Sam 17:33). Apparently cognizant of the intimidating impression they produce, Humbaba and Goliath exude self-confidence that ultimately becomes their undoing: both dis- miss the opponents as puny and therefore unworthy. Upon noticing Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Humbaba greets them with utmost derision: "The fool Gilgamesh and the brutish man ought to ask themselves, why have you come to see me? Your friend Enkidu is a small fry who does not know his own father! You are so very small that I regard you as I do a turtle or a tortoise, which does not suck its mother s milk, so I do not approach you. Even if I were to kill you, would I satisfy my stomach?" (LV V i).56 Likewise, Goliaths appearance in 1 Samuel 17 begins with him "putting the armies of Israel to shame" (v. 10) and ends with him "disdaining" David as no more than "a youth" (v. 42) and his weapons as nothing but "sticks" (v. 43). 1 Samuel 17 also stands much closer to the Epic than to the Iliad as far as the attitude toward the opponent is concerned. Whereas Homers Trojan and Achaean characters generally recognize each other as equally worthy of respect, Gilgamesh refers to Humbaba as "Something Evil, which [the sun god] Shamash hates" (SBV III i), and David dismisses Goliath as "the uncircumcised Philistine" (1 Sam 17:26, 36).57 In accordance with the latter stance, both Humbaba and Goliath are accorded grossly ignominious postmortem treatment that probably would make Homer and his intended audience recoil in horror: their heads are cut off by the victors and sent home as trophies (1 Sam 17:51, 54; LV V vi).58 The protagonist of 1 Samuel 17 likewise resembles that of the Epic rather than the participants of Homeric duels. Many of the latter, for example, Paris, Hector, and Menelaus, are royalty, but this circumstance barely registers in the Iliad. By contrast, David and Gilgamesh primarily are the paradigmatic monarchs of their respective cultures. Even more important as far as the present article is concerned, despite being Israels legitimate king (1 Sam 16:1-13) and therefore a fitting counterpart of 55 ANET , 79. Dalley translates, "Its guardian is Wer [a storm god] He is strong, never sleeps' (Myths, 143). 56 Dalley, Myths , 71-72. 57 On the Philistines as the ultimate "other" in Samuel, see David Jobling, 1 Samuel (Berit Olam; Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1998), 199-243. Gordon notes that "the Trojans and their allies are treated [by Homer] with as much decorum and honor as the Achaeans and their allies,&gt; ("Homer and Bible," 56). 58 In Gilgamesh and the Land of the Living , Gilgamesh and Enkidu present Huwawa's severed head to Enlil (Kramer, Sumerians , 197). This may account for the biblical narrators statement, anachronistic in the context of 1 Samuel 17, that David brought Goliaths head to Jerusalem, the future primary abode of Yhwh (v. 54).</page><page sequence="16">466 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 3 (201 1) Gilgamesh, in 1 Samuel 17 David is not recognized as such even by his own fam- ily (judging by the stern dressing-down he receives from his brother in v. 28) and, like Sinuhe, serves as a retainer of a petty Canaanite potentate. On top of these "hefty" parallels, several relatively minor details of 1 Samuel 17 find counterparts in the Story. In particular, the following elements are evident in both texts: 1. The protagonist picks up the gauntlet on behalf of his suzerain (Saul in 1 Samuel 17; Ammi-enshi in the Story), who is present on the battlefield, and with his explicit or implicit blessing (1 Sam 17:37b). 2. The antagonist is felled with a single projectile (an arrow in the Story; a stone from a slingshot in 1 Sam 17:49). 3. The antagonist collapses face down ("on his nose" in the Story ; "face to the ground" in 1 Sam 17:49). 4. The antagonist is finished off with his own weapon (an axe in the Story ; a sword in 1 Sam 17:51). 5. The protagonists side boisterously cheers his victory ("Asiatics roar" in the Story ; Israelites "shout" in 1 Sam 17:52).59 6. The camp of the losing side is plundered; this is presented in "measure for measure" terms, as the "mighty man of Retenu" allegedly had been after Sinuhe s cattle, and Goliath wanted Israel to serve the Philistines (1 Sam 17:9). Significantly, none of these details can be found in the Iliad. The density of paral- lels between 1 Samuel 17 and ancient Near Eastern texts is thus very substantial, especially taking into account that the biblical fragment is relatively short. D. Order The sequence of the combatants' moves in the clash between David and Goliath approximates that in the battle scene in the Story. In both cases, the pro- tagonist wins with a single remote strike and then approaches to finish off the antagonist with his own weapon; the only difference is that before shooting his deadly arrow Sinuhe dodges the missiles launched by the "mighty man of Retenu." The immediate context of the duel is likewise similar, as both David and Sinuhe meet with their suzerains immediately before and after it.60 It might appear that in 59 This parallel is pointed out in ANET&gt; 20. 60 The verses reporting David's encounter with Saul after the battle (1 Sam 17:57-18:2) do not appear in the LXX. There are reasons to believe nevertheless that they, as well as other MT pluses vis-a-vis the LXX in 1 Samuel 17-18, are integral to the text (see n. 62 below). But even with these fragments recognized as relatively late interpolations, the argument of the present article would not be seriously affected because almost all putative parallels with ancient Near Eastern and Homeric compositions are found in those parts of 1 Samuel 17 that are shared by the Hebrew and</page><page sequence="17">Frolov and Wright: Intertextuality in 1 Samuel 17 467 the battles aftermath 1 Samuel 17 reverses the order of events in the Story ("This ruler Ammi-enshi took me into his embrace. Then I carried off his [sc. the oppo- nents] goods and plundered his cattle") by recounting first the despoiling of the Philistines (v. 53) and then Davids conversation with Saul (w. 57-58). However, v. 57 clearly indicates that the two met, just like Sinuhe and Ammi-enshi, right after the duel. David appears before Saul "upon returning from slaying the Philistine" (not "from plundering Philistine tents"), with Goliath's head in his hand (which he could hardly have with him in the hot pursuit reported in v. 52). The role of the single combat with Goliath in the larger context of David's biography (see I.D above) matches the literary functions of analogous scenes in both the Epic and the Story. In the former, the battle with Humbaba is the first occa- sion on which Gilgamesh prevails over a worthy opponent and is thus the earliest proof of his martial prowess. Everything else in the composition builds either toward it (Enkidu's arrival and his stand against Gilgameshs abuses) or upon it (attracted by Gilgameshs virility, Ishtar proposes to him; rejected, she unleashes the Bull of Heaven against Uruk; when Gilgamesh and Enkidu slay it, the gods decide that Enkidu must die, which sends Gilgamesh on his ultimately futile quest for immortality). Similarly, the victory over "the mighty man of Retenu" is Sinuhe s crowning achievement in exile and the story's turning point, as right after it (and possibly, although not necessarily, because of it) he is recalled to Egypt. With all this in mind, the ordering of content in 1 Samuel 17 and around it matches ancient Near Eastern antecedents reasonably well. E. Distinctive Features In 1 Sam 17:44, Goliath tells David, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and to the beasts of the field." Humbaba threatens Gilgamesh or Enkidu in an almost identical way: "[I shall] leave your body for birds of the for- est, roaring (lions), birds of prey, and scavengers" (LV V i).61 As mentioned in I.E above, a similar intimidating taunt can be found in II 22.335-36; yet it appears that here the Hebrew Bible follows the Mesopotamian model. To begin with, the use of the first person in both 1 Samuel 17 and the Epic contrasts with the third-person formulation of the Iliad, where the subject is "dogs and birds" rather than the speaker. Further, it is only in 1 Samuel 17 and the Epic that the threat is uttered twice. David hurls it back at Goliath (1 Sam 17:46), and the vanquished Humbaba expresses regret about failing to carry it out with regard to Enkidu when the latter urges Gilgamesh to finish off the creature (LV V iii). Greek versions of the chapter. For different approaches to the vexing textual problems of 1 Samuel 17, see Dominique Barthelemy et al., The Story of David and Goliath: Textual and Literary Criti- cism. Papers of a Joint Research Venture (OBO 73; Fribourg: Editions universitaires; Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1986). 61 Dalley, Myths , 72.</page><page sequence="18">468 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 3 (201 1) Another idiosyncratic parallel between David and Gilgamesh is that both arrive on the battlefield from a sheepfold- the latter figuratively, as the city of Uruk, where his expedition originates, is repeatedly referred to as such (e.g., SBV I i; XI vi), and the former literally, as he is responsible for his family's flock (e.g., 1 Sam 16:1 1; 17:15). In both cases, the term has royal connotations: Gilgamesh is the ruler of "Uruk the sheepfold," and David is pointedly reminded by Yhwh in 2 Sam 7:8 that he was recruited for kingship "from the sheepfold." Much more remotely, a link can be drawn between the battleground settings of the Epic and 1 Samuel 17. Gilgamesh and Enkidu attack Humbaba at least in part because they are after the treasure he is posted to guard - a forest of erenu , here most likely Lebanon cedars ( Cedrus libani ), which have been highly prized throughout history for their sturdy, durable, and aesthetically pleasing lumber, espe- cially in Mesopotamia where quality construction materials are in short supply. In the context of David s early career as recounted in 1 Samuel, an expedition to Lebanon would be incongruous- not to mention that in ancient Israel, with its abundance of limestone and native trees, lumber was less of an issue. Nevertheless, the biblical narrative does include a detail that may reflect the arboreal setting of Gilgameshs clash with Humbaba: the showdown between David and Goliath unfolds in nbttn pftD, "the Terebinth Valley" (1 Sam 17:2), that is, in a place closely associated with a tree ( Pistacia palaestina). R Interpretability To state the obvious, one of the central messages of 1 Samuel 17 is formulated by David in v. 47: "The war is Yhwhs." Trusting Israels deity (esp. w. 37, 46), a "youth" (w. 33, 42) experienced in hunting rather than warfare (w. 34-36) and armed with nothing but a slingshot (v. 40) vanquishes a seasoned warrior of super- human physique wielding enormous weapons (see II.C above). Parallels with the Epic add to this message a tinge of religious polemic. In overcoming Humbaba, Gilgamesh also receives assistance from his patron deity, the sun god Shamash (LV V ii); however, Shamash s task is much easier than Yhwhs because in terms of com- bat readiness Gilgamesh is David s polar opposite. Two-thirds divine, with his body "designed" and "made perfect" by the mother goddess Belet-ili (SBV I ii), he is described as "a warrior lord of great stature," "a goring wild bull," "a strong net," and "the raging flood- wave, which can destroy even a stone wall" (SBV I i). He and Enkidu carefully arm themselves with axes and swords weighing ten talents (SBV II vi; OBV III iv), as well as with bows (OBV III vi).62 The Mesopotamian deity 62 Dalley, Myths, 51. The narrators comment that "there was no sword in the hand of David" when he prevailed over Goliath (1 Sam 17:50) makes sense only as a poignant reminder that Yhwhs protege did not have to deploy weapons of the sort used by Gilgamesh and Enkidu to dis- patch Humbaba (OBV IV). If so, chances are that the verse is absent from the LXX because Greek</page><page sequence="19">Frolov and Wright: Intertextuality in 1 Samuel 1 7 469 thus does not go beyond tipping the scales in a clash between two opponents of comparable brawn (not to mention that Gilgamesh is assisted by the equally potent Enkidu), whereas Yhwh proves capable of overturning extremely long odds.63 This polemical overtone would be tremendously inspirational to the Israelite/Jewish audiences that for generations lived in the shadow, or under the heel, of regional superpowers that claimed patronage by the Mesopotamian pantheon. On a related note, by using the Epic as its hypotext, 1 Samuel 17 overturns the Mesopotamian model of an ideal king, operative in the former composition. Just like Gilgamesh, Saul is an elite warrior (the probable meaning of nni, literally "select," in 1 Sam 9:2) of towering stature (1 Sam 9:2; 10:23-24) equipped with con- ventional weapons and protective gear (1 Sam 13:22; 17:38-39). Yet it is David, who is none of the above, who saves the day - in accordance with his own maxim, "Yhwh does not save by spear or sword" (1 Sam 17:47). Since a similar attitude underlies the "law of the king" in Deut 17:14-20 (which forbids accumulation of too much money and too many horses by the monarch, preventing him thereby from building a strong army, but requires him to read and copy the Torah), these obser- vations suggest that 1 Samuel 17 is a Deuteronomistic creation. Yet another important contrast between David and Gilgamesh is that they go into battle for vastly different reasons. Although one of Gilgameshs stated objectives is to "exterminate from the land Something Evil, which Shamash hates" (SBV III i), most of his thoughts are about honor and glory, as well as about enriching Uruk (and himself) with booty of precious cedars: "How strong is the offspring of Uruk I will cause the lands to hear! My hand I will poise and will fell the cedars, a name that endures I will make for me!" (OBV III v).64 And further, "If I should fall, I shall have won fame. People will say, 'Gilgamesh grappled in combat with ferocious Huwawa. He was nobly born" (OBV III iv).65 David, by contrast, is motivated mostly by the desire to "remove the shame from Israel" (1 Sam 17:26) so that "all the land may know that Israel has a god" (v. 46). Although aware that Saul had promised to reward Goliaths slayer with "great riches" and "freedom" (probably exemption from taxes) for his clan, as well as with the hand of the king s daughter, David never brings up any of these in his conversations with Saul before or after the battle (17:32-37, 57-58). The only award he definitely receives is a military com- translators, unfamiliar with Mesopotamian literature, failed to grasp the allusion and therefore dis- missed the comment as redundant. This consideration supports the view that the MT pluses vis- a-vis the LXX in 1 Samuel 17-18 are integral components of the text that the translator dropped in an attempt to remove perceived inconsistencies and redundancies. 63 Bringing to mind the simile of Humbabas cry as a "flood-weapon" (SBV II v, vi), the last of the epithets quoted above strongly suggests that in terms of martial prowess Gilgamesh was not substantially inferior to his opponent. 64 Dalley, Myths , 64; ANET , 80. 65 Dalley, Myths , 144.</page><page sequence="20">470 Journal of Biblical Literature 130, no. 3 (201 1) mission (18:5, 13).66 The implication is that the model king of Israel is supposed to care not about his own glory but rather about Yhwh and the community - again, in accordance with the Deuteronomic "law of the king," which cautions against the monarch's heart being "elevated above his brethren" (Deut 17:20) J 67 Unlike the Epic , the presence of the Story in the intertextual background of 1 Samuel 17 has to do not with the chapter proper but rather with its broad liter- ary context. This presence gives the audience the very first, faint taste of what the narrator has in store for David: he will, after the manner of Sinuhe, have to flee his native country through no fault of his own and build a career with strangers. More- over, just like Sinuhe, he will never abandon the hope of returning home and even- tually will be welcomed there. The Story also throws into deeper relief the unfairness and irrationality of Sauls attitude toward David: while Sinuhe s suzerains, both Asiatic and Egyptian, are highly appreciative of his martial feat (the former embraces him right after it, and the latter grants him a full pardon), Saul meets Davids success with mounting envy and malice (1 Samuel 18- 19).68 The contrast between Saul and the pharaoh is especially stark: while the latter recalls Sinuhe to Egypt after he defeats the "mighty man of Retenu," the former chases David out of Israel in no small part due to his victory over Goliath. By tapping the Story , 1 Samuel 17 amplifies the anti-Saulide agenda of the book of Samuel and the over- all pro-Davidic slant of the Deuteronomistic composition. Imitation of ancient Near Eastern antecedents in 1 Samuel 17 is highly interpretable because it enriches or enhances in multiple respects the thrust of the chapter and the corpus of which it is a part. III. Conclusions The main result of the investigation undertaken in the present article is that the putative ancient Near Eastern parallels of 1 Samuel 17 are substantially closer than the Greek ones to meeting the criteria of imitation suggested by MacDon- ald.69 While the latter fail the test of all six of these criteria, the former satisfy per- fectly at least four of them (density, order, distinctive features, and interpretability) 66 Ironically, when Saul later offers David his daughters, this comes not as a prize but as a potentially lethal trap (18:17-29). 67 Eventually, David does, after the manner of Gilgamesh, obtain a "house of cedar" (2 Sam 7:2, 7) and "make a name for himself" (2 Sam 8:13). However, in a reversal of the Epics trajectory, whereas Gilgameshs quest for cedar and fame rids Uruk of his overbearing routines (SBV I ii) David transmogrifies into the chief troublemaker just two short chapters later (2 Samuel 11-12). 68 The text does not explicitly say that Sinuhe was pardoned as a result of his victory, but the pharaoh appears to change his heart when "told about this situation in which [Sinuhe] was" 69 What makes this result especially trustworthy is that MacDonald argues, based on his criteria, that the New Testament massively imitates and emulates Homer.</page><page sequence="21">Frolov and Wright: Intertextuality in 1 Samuel 17 471 and reasonably well the remaining two (availability and analogy). What is more, on each individual criterion the Epic and the Story taken together substantially out- perform the Iliad. The contrast is especially stark when it comes to the criteria of density (four major and six minor parallels with the former versus two minor par- allels with the latter) and distinctive features (at least two and possibly three dis- tinctive details shared with the Mesopotamian composition and none whatsoever with Homer). Expressed in stochastic terms (as befits the complex and dynamic system that is biblical exegesis), the principal corollary of these conclusions is that the likelihood of the David-Goliath pericope being genetically linked to ancient Near Eastern antecedents is relatively high, while a connection of this kind between the chapter in question and Homer is relatively implausible. The parallels between 1 Samuel 17 and the Iliad are best attributable to accidental convergence, common dependence on ancient Near Eastern literary classics (most of whose oeuvres predate both Homer and the Hebrew Bible by centuries if not millennia), or diffusion of motifs, tropes, and concepts. Chances are that the biblical chapter absorbed and trans- formed, in Kristeva's words, elements of The Epic of Gilgamesh and The Story of Sinuhe and thus, unbeknownst to the Bibles readers until less than two centuries ago, channeled these texts into Western culture.</page></plain_text>
