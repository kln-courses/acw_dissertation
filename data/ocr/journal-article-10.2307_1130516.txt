Speech Patterning of Natural Discourse of Well and De- pressed Mothers and Their Young Children. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1987, 58, 395-400. The speech behavior of 14 depressed and 18 nondepressed mothers during conversations with their 3-year-old children was examined in this study. Given the general motor retardation, reduced energy level, and social withdrawal of depressed individuals, the speech patterns of depressed mothers were pre- dicted to differ from the speech patterns of well mothers. Depressed mothers vocalized less often and responded less quickly to the cessation of their children's speech than healthy mothers. How- ever, in a mildly stressful situation (awaiting a doctor's visit) the depressed mothers, but not the healthy mothers, significantly increased their level of speech productivity. Children of the de- pressed mothers spoke less than children of healthy women, particularly while sitting and eating lunch with their mothers. The observed difference in the mothers' behaviors was interpreted as an indication that the 2 groups of children are exposed to very different patterns of socialization. The offspring of depressed women are being taught both to keep social interaction to a minimum and to be overreactive to even mild stresses. The differences in the children's behavior may indicate that already these 3-year-old children have learned to keep their interactions with their mother to a minimum. This manner of adaptation may have negative effects on the child's continued social, emotional, and cognitive development. Inherent in the diagnosis of depression is the expectation that depressed individuals show generalized motoric retardation. Previ- ous research has demonstrated that when speaking in an interview or asked to tell a story, depressed individuals speak less than normal controls and less than other psychiat- ric patients (Aronson &amp; Weintraub, 1972; Kanfer, 1960). The question addressed in the current study is whether this pattern of re- duced speech carries over into the daily be- havior of depressed women when they are acting in their mothering role as socializers of young children. Even though young children may make demands and rouse their mothers, depressed women may speak less to their young children due to an inability to compen- sate completely for their depression. A second salient aspect of the speech of depressed patients is that their speech is punctuated by long pauses (i.e., greater than 2 sec; see Pope, Blass, Siegman, &amp; Raher, 1970). Such pauses have been attributed to the intrusion of depressed thoughts that inter- fere with the patient's speaking rather than being reflective of overall motor retardation (Siegman, in press). We hypothesized that such slowing down would be apparent in the interaction of depressed women and their children in that the depressed women would respond more slowly than normal mothers to the cessation of speech by their children. Thus, both within-speaker and between- speaker pauses are predicted to be extended in the depressed individual's speech. Prior research has shown that subjects re- spond to stress with faster speech rate, shorter response latencies, and fewer and/or shorter silences (Siegman &amp; Pope, 1972).

De- pressed women were predicted to react to stress more than normal mothers and to re- spond to the situation by both increasing the amount of overall verbalization and decreas- ing the latency of response to the cessation of their child's speech. There were no explicit predictions as to whether children this young would reveal in their own speech behavior the influences of living with and being so- cialized by a depressed mother. Method Subjects.-The sample consisted of 32 mother-child dyads. Families were recruited via newspaper advertisements that solicited participants for a study of child development in families in which mother had no history of psychiatric illness, or mother had suffered from periods of depression. All volunteers were given a standard psychiatric interview, the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS-L; Spitzer &amp; Endicott, 1977), and were diagnosed according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria (Spitzer, En- dicott, &amp; Robins, 1978). The SADS-L was ad- ministered by a psychiatric nurse-practi- tioner. The reliability of the diagnostic procedures, established by obtaining inde- pendent diagnosis of a sample of the inter- views by the staff of the New York Psychiatric Institute, yielded a 100% agreement rating. There were 18 dyads in which mother had no history of psychiatric illness and 14 dyads in which mother suffered from unipolar depression, a major affective disorder. These families are a subset of the larger sample re- cruited for the NIMH Child-rearing Study, Marian Radke-Yarrow, principal investigator.' The families were predominantly middle class, and all were Caucasian. The groups were matched for mother's age, child's age, and Hollingshead ratings of SES and mother's education. The details of these indices are presented in Table 1. Half of each group of children were female. All the children were healthy and free of hearing or neurological deficits.

Procedure.-Each mother-child dyad made 3 half-day visits to an apartment situated on the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. During these visits the mother and child had (1) free time, such as time to watch TV, play with available toys, and read magazines or books; (2) normal family routine time, such as time for the mother to prepare lunch for herself and her child; and (3) scripted time, such as time for a doctor's visit. Three 5-min observations were used for this study: (1) the first 5 min of the mother's preparing lunch, (2) the airst 5 min of the child and mother eating lunch together, and (3) the 5-min waiting period preceding a visit by a doctor. The waiting period was intended to reflect a mildly stressful situation. It was initi- ated by entry of a "doctor" (a white-coated male experimenter) who introduced himself 1The NIMH Child-rearing Study, Marian Radke-Yarrow, P.I., is a large study of child rearing in families in which parents have no history of psychiatric illness or in which one or both parents suffer from affective illness.

He asked the mother to remove the child's shirt, shoes, and socks while he was setting up in the side room. The mother and child then had 5 min of waiting. Measures.-The Automatic Vocal Trans- action Analyzer (AVTA) (Feldstein &amp; Wel- kowitz, 1978; Jaffe &amp; Feldstein, 1970) was used to analyze the sound and silence pat- terns of the mother's and child's speech in each of the three settings. The input to the AVTA was an audiotape of buzzes and si- lences created by a coder who listened to the audio/videotape record of the observation and recorded a buzz on the input tape each time she heard speech. A second coder indepen- dently created an audiotape of buzzes and si- lences for 10 of the dyads. The interrater reli- ability for these 10 cases was 100% agreement for whether mother or child spoke and was 99% for the absolute length of the speech bouts. The AVTA sampled the audio input 298 times/sec. The output of the AVTA system consists of two types of speech and two types of pause or silence. An individual could be speaking, or both mother and child could be speaking simultaneously. In the situations sampled for this study, none of the mother- child dyads engaged in simultaneous speech. An individual may pause in his or her speak- ing and then resume speaking (a pause), or an individual may pause in speaking and the other member of the dyad may be the next person to initiate speech (a switching pause). The time from which an individual begins to speak until the other partner speaks is called a speaking turn. We chose to focus on two AVTA mea- sures: total sum of vocalization (total time of speaking) and average length of the switching pauses. The total sum of vocalization of each member of the dyad is an index of how much speech that individual contributed. The aver- age length of switching pauses reveals how much time elapsed between the time one partner became silent and the other partner responded and provides an index of the back- and-forth flow of the conversation. For ex- ample, if the average length of switching pauses for the child is brief, the mother responded quickly to the cessation of her child's speaking. If the average length of the mother's switching pause is brief, her child responded quickly to the termination of her speaking. Results Four planned comparisons were per- formed to assess the major hypotheses of the study. The first set of hypotheses tested was that depressed women would speak less to their children and respond more slowly to the termination of their children's speech than healthy mothers in low-stress settings. Anal- ysis of data summed across the lunch- preparation and eating-lunch observations showed that depressed women spoke signifi- cantly less to their children than healthy women: the mean sum of vocalization for depressed mothers was 116.94 sec (SD = 41.6) and for healthy mothers was 180.27 sec (SD = 65.6), one-tailed, t(30) = 3.15, p &lt; .002. There was also a trend for depressed women to respond more slowly to the cessa- tion of their child's speech: the mean average length of switching pauses for children of de- pressed mothers was 5.15 sec (SD = 3.63) and for children of healthy mothers was 3.49 sec (SD = 3.04), one-tailed, t(30) = 1.40, p &lt; .09. This pattern of results is shown in Figure 1. The second set of hypotheses was that, when under some stress, the depressed women would increase both the amount of vocalization and the rapidity with which they responded to their children, whereas the healthy women would not show changes in the patterning of their speech. This was tested by comparing the change score in amount of vocalization and in average length of switching pauses from the relatively stress- free situations of lunch preparation and eating to the situation of awaiting the doctor's visit. This was computed as: [awaiting doctor -1/2 (preparing lunch + eating lunch)]. There was a significant difference in the change scores for amount of vocalization: the mean change score for the depressed women was 37.88 (SD = 52.47) and for healthy women was - 19.77 (SD = 50.55), one-tailed, t(30) = 3.15, p &lt; .002. The stress resulted in increases in the amount of speech produced by the depressed mothers, whereas normal mothers slightly re- duced their total amount of speech. Both groups of mothers reacted to the stress situa- tion by decreasing the amount of time until they responded to their children's speech. The average change score for switching pauses for children of depressed women was -3.25 sec (SD = 3.4) and for children of healthy women was -1.19 sec (SD = 2.9). The depressed women, though, showed more of a reduction in the time until they re- sponded to the cessation of their children's speech as a function of the mild stress than</page><page sequence="4">398 Child Development un 120 - Healthy z Mothers o 100 0----O Children of SHealthy Mothers 4U--- Depressed N 80 Mothers "i a 13- O Children of S 0o 60- Depressed  ,/ Mothers 40 - / 0 o S 20 0 Lunch Eating Awaiting Preparation Lunch Doctor c 7 7 0 6 \ U U) 5 % - 4 j " 0 Cn Lunch Eating Awaiting Preparation Lunch Doctor FIG. 1.--Sum of vocalizations and average length of switching pauses for normal and unipolar- depressed women and their children. did the healthy women, one-tailed, t(30) 1.83, p &lt; .04. In order to understand how these differ- ences in the mother's speech behavior were reflected in or interacted with their children's speech behavior, two separate MANOVA analyses were performed: one considered the total speech of each partner and one consid- ered the average length of the switching pauses of the mother and child. As explained by Tatsuoka (1971), the information provided by a conjoint MANOVA-a MANOVA with two dependent variables-is distinct from that provided by two separate MANOVAs. The conjoint MANOVA, in this case, would provide information about how depressed women and their children differ from normal women and their children in terms of sum of vocalizations and switching pauses consid- ered simultaneously. Although this may be an interesting issue, our questions concerned whether there were differences between the mother-child pairs in terms of total speaking to one another, and, separately, whether there were differences in the speed of verbal re- sponsitivity to the other member of the dyad. Since the two measures were analyzed sepa- rately, a corrected p value of .025 was re- quired for significance. For both MANOVAs, the between-subjects factors were group (nor- mal vs. depressed) and person (mother vs. child), and the within-subjects factor was set- ting (lunch preparation, eating lunch, and awaiting doctor's examination), a 2 x 2 x 3 factorial design. A priori contrasts were con- structed for the three levels of the setting fac- tor. The hypotheses tested via the contrasts were: (1) For the nonstress contrast, Did the mean behavior in Setting 1 (lunch prepara- tion) differ from the mean behavior in Setting 2 (eating lunch)? and (2) For the stress con- trast, Did the average behavior observed in Settings 1 and 2 (the low-stress situations of lunch preparation and eating lunch) differ from the behavior observed in Setting 3 (the mild stress situation of awaiting the doctor's visit). These two a priori contrasts, rather than the omnibus hypothesis, were tested in the following analyses. Preliminary analyses- two-way factorial ANOVAs of group x sex for each of the 12 dependent measures- indicated that there was no main effect for sex of child, nor did sex of child interact with the group factor (all p values &gt; .27); hence, sex of child was not considered in further analyses. The main effect of the stress contrast for the setting factor reached significance for both dependent measures: sum of vocalization, F(1,60) = 9.59, p &lt; .003; average length of switching pauses, F(1,60) = 58.10, p &lt; .001. Additionally, the highest-order effect that was significant was the interaction of the stress contrast of the setting factor and the group factor. This also reached significance for both dependent measures: sum of vocalizations, F(1,60) = 8.14, p &lt; .006; average length of switching pauses, F(1,60) = 6.74, p &lt; .01. This pair of results indicated that, although both groups reacted to the mild stress with increased vocalizations and decreased latency to respond to the other member of the dyad, the depressed mothers and their children showed a greater behavioral change in the mildly stressful versus the low-stress settings than did the normal mothers and their chil- dren. Also, the person main effect was sig- nificant for the average length of switching pauses measure, F(1,60) = 10.45, p &lt; .002. This finding indicates that, averaged over set- tings, the children responded more quickly to the cessation of mother's speech than vice versa, that is, the switching pauses for the mothers were briefer than the switching pauses for the children. Last, a discriminant-function analysis was performed in order to ascertain which mea- sure(s) best discriminated between the two groups of subjects. The single best measure, correctly classifying 84% of the dyads, was the amount of child's vocalization while eat- ing lunch with his or her mother: the children</page><page sequence="5">Breznitz and Sherman 399 of depressed women spoke significantly less than the children of healthy women, F(1,30) = 25.17, p &lt; .001. Discussion These data both confirm and add to the body of research that has been directed at ex- amining the noncontent aspects of speech be- havior of clinical and normal samples. Prior research has shown reduced productivity by depressed patients in an interview situation (Aronson &amp; Weintraub, 1972; Kanfer, 1960). The current findings indicate that depressed women have reduced speech productivity in naturalistic situations when the speaking part- ner is their young child. Moreover, as re- ported by Kanfer (1960) for a mixed sample of psychiatric patients, the depressed women in this sample markedly increased their speech productivity as the degree of emotionality in- herent in the situation increased. Kanfer in- fluenced the emotionality of the situation by varying the topic of conversation. In the pres- ent study, changing the emotionality of the situation was accomplished by introducing a mild stress-anticipation of the doctor's examination. In contrast to the depressed women, the healthy mothers did not change their speech productivity when this minor stress was introduced. We interpret these re- sults as indicating that the children of these two groups of women are thus being so- cialized to handle stressful situations in very different ways. Examination of the be- havior of the children indicates that both groups of children were feeling anxious, in that both increased their amount of speech and markedly decreased their response laten- cies (Siegman &amp; Pope, 1972). The mothers' reactions, in turn, served either to confirm or disconfirm the children's anxiety reactions: depressed women affirmed it via the changes in their own behavior, whereas normal mothers' behavior denied this conclusion. Certainly a doctor's visit may reasonably in- voke anxiety when one is sick and not feeling well. But this was not the condition of the staged "doctor" situation. The mother had been told that the doctor was only going to take some measurements of the child. None- theless, the depressed women reacted with signs of anxiety. We suggest that the behavior of the depressed mothers seen in this setting is likely to be representative of how these mothers react to stress in their daily lives. We speculate that through the process of observa- tional learning, the children of the depressed women are learning to react to even mild stresses in an exaggerated manner. The nor- mal women remained calm and thereby in- formed their children that there was nothing to worry about. What is interesting is that al- though the diagnostic groups of mothers dif- fered in whether they altered the amount of speech they produced, both groups of mothers reduced the time until they re- sponded to the cessation of their child's speech. We interpret this change to be a sign of sensitivity to the obvious changes in the children's anxiety level. Thus, although the healthy women did not indicate to their chil- dren that there was anything to worry about, they did change their behavior in a way that showed sensitivity to the change in the chil- dren's state. Because the depressed women both increased the productivity of their speech and decreased the latency of their re- sponses, it is more difficult to know whether the children felt that mother was responding to them and their changed needs, or whether mother was just confirming via a number of behavioral changes that this was an anxiety- laden situation. The results of analyses of the children's data indicated that the cumulative effects of living with and being socialized by a de- pressed mother were already apparent in the speech behavior of very young children; like their mothers, these 21/2-31/2-year-olds spoke less than offspring of healthy mothers. At an age when speech productivity, vocabulary size, and grammatical complexity normally show rapid growth, what may cause a young child to refrain from speaking in general and, as indicated by the discriminant analysis, par- ticularly to refrain from speaking when eating lunch with mother? Our hypothesis is that the child's overtures have not been generally reinforced by the mother, that she has failed to provide a consistent welcome to the child, and that the child has consequently learned to keep interaction to a minimum. These specu- lations are supported by assessments of these children's attachment relationships with their mothers, which show that 71% of the off- spring of healthy mothers but only 53% of those of depressed mothers have a secure at- tachment relationship (Radke-Yarrow, Cum- mings, Kuczynski, &amp; Chapman, 1985). Having learned that mother is not welcoming, these children adapt. Yet at an age where there is much to learn from one's mother and many new cognitive and social skills to practice, the manner of adaptation revealed by the current study appears costly and may have profound negative effects on the child's continued so- cial, emotional, and cognitive development.</page><page sequence="6">400 Child Development References Aronson, H., &amp; Weintraub, W.
