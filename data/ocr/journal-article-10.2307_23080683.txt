<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON GROWTH IN ITS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ASPECTS Ludwig von Bertalanffy * If I am going to speak about interrelationships between somatic and mental growth, such a presentation obviously can consist of only a personal selection from an enormous amount of material which I would not be competent to review in its entirety. I can only remind you of a few aspects which seem interesting and important. To come right to the point let me start with what I will call the biological prerequisites of human development and human culture. One of these prerequisites is the characteristic course somatic de velopment and growth take in man. As a general rule the course of growth in many animals, from clams to crustaceans to fish and to mammals, presents a very characteristic curve. If we plot such a growth curve, with time as the abscissa and body weight as the ordi nate, we obtain an S-shaped curve, meaning that in early life the in crease in body weight is slow, followed by a rather rapid increase, then by a decline in growth rate until the mature size is reached. The one organism which is an exception is Man, in whom a growth cycle ap pears to be added so that the infant period is greatly prolonged (Fig. 1). Animals go swiftly through the period of their somatic growth and soon reach sexual maturity and adulthood; on the other hand, the characteristic shape of his growth curve gives Man his uniquely long period of youth. This characteristic shape of the human growth curve is a quantita tive expression of a principle which was enunciated some 30 years ago by the Dutch anatomist, Bolk. Compared with the development of sub human species human development shows retardation in a number of characteristics. This is found, e.g., in the skull: the cranium of the baby chimpanzee resembles that of a human being much more than does the cranium of the adult chimpanzee; a similar retardation, leading to the preservation of primitive ancestral characteristics, is found in other re spects. Disturbances of the normal hormonal balance may lead, in man, to a reappearance of simian characteristics like prognathism, hypertrichosis, or precocious puberty. This retardation reflected in the human growth curve is very consequential; for the characteristic * Dr. Bertalanffy is Director of Biological Research, Psychiatric and Psychoso matic Research Institute, Mt. Sinai Hospital, Los Angeles and Visiting Professor of Physiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.</page><page sequence="2">14 MERRILL-PALMER QUARTEBLY shape of his curve gives man, with his long period of youth, the op portunity for learning and mental development. Related to this is another interesting characteristic. In birds and mammals we can distinguish between nidifugous and nidicolous species: those in which the young reach independence and leave the nest early, and those in which young are born in a rather undeveloped state and need parental care for a long period. Think of a kitten bora blind and helpless, compared with a young colt. This difference de pends on the index of cerebralization, that is, the ratio of the hemis pheres to the brain stem, nidifugous species being the more advanced forms with the higher cerebralization. Portmann,18 a Swiss anatomist, emphasized that man is unique in representing the case of a secondary nidicolous. According to his cerebralization and owing to a long gestation period, he is born at a stage that anatomically would correspond to that of a nidifugous animal. Nevertheless, behaviorally he is nidicolous. The human baby needs and receives extensive maternal care at a time when his sensory and neural equipment are well completed. Here we possibly have one important biological root of mother fixation, the Oedipus complex, and other psychoanalytic items, possibly related to the so-called imprint ing in young animals after Lorenz. Of course, the uniqueness of man is based further upon the tre mendous development of his brain. The brain is a rather extraordinary organ in that cell divisions do not occur in the post-embryonic state. It is alluring to compare the curve of brain growth with that of mental growth, although we have been warned that the form of the mental growth curve as derived from one test may be radically different from that of another test.13 However, it is interesting to note that both curves, determined by researchers who hardly know of each other, Fig. 1. Growth cycles of Man, Mouse and Abramis.</page><page sequence="3">Fall, 1956 15 show a remarkable similarity. The growth of the brain is rather excep tional. For, in contrast to the growth of the whole body and most of the organs which show an "adolescent spurt," 20 that is, a second accelera tion and hence the characteristic growth curve as discussed, the brain follows a curve resembling a simple decaying exponential (Fig. 2).* So also does the growth curve of intelligence (Fig. 3).

Curves of human growth, showing four main types of growth in various organs. (Redrawn by Tanner20 after Scammon.) Besides these familiar features, I would like to mention one or two theoretical aspects which seem much to the point in view of current discussions and problems. There are certain schemes or models in the biological sciences which, although they should be obsolete by now, still exert consider able influence in the way of thinking. I will call them the utilitarian and the automaton models of the organism and of behavior. * This is perhaps a consequence of the strong negative allometry of the brain, cf. Bertalanffy,3 p· 32S ; 8</page><page sequence="4">16 MERRILL-PALMEB QUARTERLY By this I mean: It is familiar to consider all biological phenomena from the viewpoint of usefulness and survival. Indeed, Darwin's theory of selection was a biological application of the utilitarian model of free competition of the Manchester school of economists. On the other hand, there is what you may call the "penny-in-the-slot-machine" theory of the organism. More learnedly, it is called the stimulus-re sponse scheme. The organism is considered to be an essentially passive system, put into action only by stimuli from outside. Now, these models are far from being realistic. There are in numerable phenomena in the biological world as well as in human culture which only in a forced way can be brought under the utilitarian scheme. Furthermore, the organism is not a passive automaton re acting to stimuli, but rather is an essentially and autonomously active system.5·pp·18·106 The early development of behavior has been studied in embryos and fetuses of various species, from axolotls to birds to human em bryos.5· p·114 ; 10 It has been found that spontaneous activity precedes stimulus-response, that is, the classical reflexes. The first movements of the fetus present a spontaneous activity at random, and these activities are mass actions of the body as a whole or extended body regions Localized reflexes appear only later on, in connection with the estab lishment of reflex arcs and myelinization of the nervous pathways. This form of activity perseveres in the vigorous random movements of the young baby "with everything it has available."14·p- 62 Similarly, stimu ^ CO*fPOS/T£ AG* CUX/f OP fA/T£L¿/G£A/C£ Fig. 3.

(After Bayley.1)</page><page sequence="5">Fall, 1956 17 lation over extended body areas, as in stroking, is effective earlier than is a punctifoim stimulus, like touching part of the skin with a hair. Here a general principle becomes apparent, which has been aptly formulated 10·p·139 as follows: Specific experiences, like specific acts of behavior, become individuated out of totalities rather than first syn thetized from discrete elements. These features : primary activity, be havior as a whole at start, development by differentiation, appear to be of a general nature, and basic for mental as well as somatic develop ment. What I have just said indicates certain dangers of the concept of homeostasis which is so much in vogue nowadays. The notion of homeostasis is meant to signify that the organism, biological, mental, or sociological, tends to maintain some sort of equilibrium. It is to be considered, however, that the theory of homeostasis implies a machine model of the organism. The basic model is not a simple stimulus response scheme with one-way processes as in classical reflexology where the brain is considered a sort of gigantic telephone exchange, with myriads of wires, switches, and connections. Rather it is the feedback model, the prototype of which is the thermostat, with circu lar processes, which provides for the constancy of organismic variables in the face of changes outside, so allowing for teleological behavior and granting the maintenance of the organism. But a machine model it remains, that is, an explanation in terms of pre-arranged structures. But this, as I have emphasized elsewhere,4 does not account for a very important and basic class of biological regulations, namely, those by a dynamic interplay of forces within the living system as a whole and without fixed homeostatic mechanisms. Furthermore, the theory of homeostasis is essentially utilitarian, as it conceives of somatic and mental events in view of the mainten ance or reestablishment of some sort of "equilibrium." This misses what in anthropomorphic terms may be called "creativity," that is, the non-utilitarian aspects of living nature and of the mental world. It is only by a tour de force or rather a sleight of hand that, say, artistic work or horse racing can be said to serve for some homeostatic equili brium—the notion becomes so diluted that it hardly means anything.21 I mention this point because it has rather far-reaching implications. If the notion of homeostatic maintenance is put in the center, then obviously the so-called well adjusted individual will be the ultimate goal of education; that is, a well-oiled robot maintaining itself in optimal biological, psychological, and social homeostasis. This is about the state of affairs in Brave New World, everybody being conditioned to optimal functioning, every conflict solved, creativity eliminated as a threat to psychological and social balance, and recalcitrant elements being deported to some remote island. But at least Mr. Savage in</page><page sequence="6">18 MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY Huxley's novel could not stand this ideal state of affairs, and hung himself by the neck. Now let us see how these biological prerequisites apply to the de velopment of the human mind. In the considerations to follow, I will draw heavily on Charlotte Buehler's basic work, Kindheit und Jugend,9 As I cannot given quotations in every instance, I want my indebtedness to this classic to be understood clearly. The more so since I have ar rived at the viewpoints mentioned from the biological and epistemo logica! side, so the parallelism to Charlotte Buehler's theory of child psychology is the more gratifying. We can formulate our problem in the question, How does man be come Homo sapiens and Homo faber? If, first, we look at how the child orients himself in his surrounding world, it is well to remember a rather basic point. According to Kant, there are universal and a priori forms of intuition and categories such as time, space, substance, causality, and so forth. Today we realize that cognition and the experience of the world does not follow hard and fast rules. Rather, the categories of cognition largely depend on the psychophysical organization of the organism concerned, on the one side, and linguistic and cultural factors on the other.6 For example, the category of substance which is so obvious and unavoidable to us seems to be connected with our linguistic habits, the construction of sentences with substantive and adjective in Indo-Germanic languages, which leads to the Aristotelian separation of "substance" and "attri bute." There seem to be, say, in the language of the Hopi Indians or the Chinese, quite different and, to us, alien ways of bringing order into experience. I shall not develop this aspect further, but I wish to bring out that the categories of cognition, thought to be absolute and a priori, in fact slowly are formed in the mental development of the child. Take the most fundamental category, the separation between the ego and the outer world. It appears that the principle of differentia tion from an originally unorganized whole obtains, which we have al ready mentioned in another context. The separation of the ego takes place sometime during the second year of life. Then the young child first says "I" and "Mine." At the same time, this separation sets the first conflict of the "1" with the outer world and the child enters what is known as his first negative, or sulking phase. Somewhat later value judgments such as guilt, confidence, distrust, lying and the like appear, so that what Freud called the super-ego is born. Something similar is true for the more specific categories of space, time, and so forth. While they seem not to play a role for the child in the first period, they develop with accumulation of experiences, distances to be estimated, and expectations formed about the future.</page><page sequence="7">Fall, 1956 19 So the child of three years already has a universe extended beyond instantaneous experience into the past and into space. Charlotte Bueh ler particularly emphasizes one factor essential for adequate orienta tion, namely, the development of what psychologists call perceptual constancies. Objects are perceived, for example, as maintaining the same size, although the image on the retina of course is smaller when the object is farther away. While the error in estimating size at a distance of 11 meters is nearly 50% in the 2-year old, it decreases to V3 in the 3- and 4-year old. The well-known work of Piaget has given further insight (for a brief survey, cf. Mays,10). One essential conclusion of Piaget's is that the child arrives at categorical notions by way of operations he per forms. In particular, Piaget stresses the mechanism of "reversibility." That is, a general notion such as that of conservation of mass will only be obtained when and if the child is able mentally to reverse the process, to imagine, for example, that a plasticine sausage can be brought back into the initial form of a cake. This is one aspect of an important prerogative of man, namely, his capability of mental as op posed to corporeal trial and error.7 Similarly to an often-stated epistemological theory contending that scientific concepts are defined by operations the physicist performs, Piaget finds the operational principle in the mental development of the child. The refrain, so to speak, in Piaget's investigations is that the cate gories of the adult differentiate out from rather indefinite intuitions. Concepts of weight and volume evolve from an amorphous concept of substance such as of the clay or plasticine which can be brought into various shapes. From a primitive intuition of moving bodies segregate out the notions of space traversed, of a uniformly flowing time, and different velocity moving objects may have. The copying of a figure as a circle, triangle, or rectangle follows drawing a shapeless closed figure which represents the most general topological character istics. The Cartesian system of fixed horizontal and vertical axes de velops after a stage where a tree or house is drawn perpendicular to any odd inclined surface, and so on. This is quite in line with what we have heard earlier about the development of motoric behavior, and with the principles of development in general.5·p· 43 As to the development of Homo fab er, the use of tools, as, for ex ample, the dragging in of some desired object by means of a string, this already occurs in the tenth month of life. This mental age, then, would correspond to the utmost Koehler's famous chimpanzees are capable to do. A still higher achievement is the work detached from instrumental use and enjoyed for itself. This would be the origin of what at a higher level is called Tart pour Tart. But now we come to the supreme achievement and real monopoly</page><page sequence="8">20 MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY of man which I conceive as lying in symbolism or language in the broadest sense.7 According to the theory of language after Karl Bueh ler, three kinds of language are to be distinguished, namely, language as expression, as command, and as representation. Language as repre sentation of things by freely chosen symbols is, so far as we know, limited to man. So naturally, language as expression and as command, as also found in animals, comes first in the crying baby, and language as representation follows later. I have ventured the opinion that historically language is born from the spirit of magic, as naming things gives dominance and control over them. I cannot tell in how far this hypothesis is substantiated by pre-historic and ethnological knowl edge. But it seems borne out well by the study of the mental develop ment of the child. Analogy, as Charlotte Buehler 9·p·129 says, dominates the whole mental world of the young child, all processes in things liv ing and non-living being considered as volitional. This brings us to another aspect. It is a well-known tenet that hu manity goes through an animistic stage before arriving at a so-called objective world view. It can be said that the inorganic and non-living was discovered only in the Renaissance. Even Aristotle's system where everything "seeks" its natural place was still an animistic one, and only with the advent of natural science the barrier between object and sub ject, ego and non-ego, things outside and consciousness inside was com pleted. Whether this is the only correct or the absolutely superior world picture is a question which we don't have to decide here. In any case, the child goes through an animistic phase where, as for St. Francis, everything animate or inanimate is his brother or sister. Whether it is the doll, a pencil, or some other toy, everything is for the child of the second to the fourth year an animate being. Just as, historically, the progress of science can be conceived of as a process of progressive de-anthropomorphization,6 so the empathie experience of oneness in the child—or should I say the child in Western civiliza tion—is superseded by a world of foreign and inanimate things. This process, together with the development of logical inference and hence grasping of universale, is achieved at 12 years 9·p· 226—that intelligence level newspaper reports warn you never to overstep in your communi cations to the press, as it is the mental age of their readers. I, person ally, have a higher opinion of the reading public. Now I come to another point previously mentioned: that the organism should not be considered a responding machine but rather as a primary activity. This viewpoint is fully born out by child psy chology. Primary behavior is spontaneous, stemming from the spon taneous random activities already shown by the fetus. It is further continued in the play activities of the child. This goes along with Funktionslust, a term of Karl Buehler, a pleasure in the activity as</page><page sequence="9">Fall, 1956 21 such, independent of the goal to be reached or the work achieved. Even before Karl Buehler, the great German aesthetician, Johannes Volkelt, has emphasized this pleasure of function as an essential part of aesthetic experience. As a matter of definition, "play" as formation of function can be distinguished from "creativity" as production of an objective work.9·p·102 Factually, they intergrade into each other. In the mental realm, this corresponds to curiosity, love of investi gating, and a tendency to learn whatever the content may be. Curios ity as a non-utilitarian play activity was justly conceived by Lorenz15 as the source from which later on mental activities, up to the achieve ments of science, develop. In a similar vein, Charlotte Buehler em phasizes that learning, grasping of various aspects of reality and facts is, for the young child, not an unwanted duty but rather an inbuilt tendency, as the child cannot get enough facts to be satisfied. Now can we draw any practical lessons from these theoretical con siderations? I think we definitely can. The psychobiological aspects we have discussed have eminently practical implications. I believe many criticisms of the present system of education can be summarized by saying that there is a somewhat exaggerated anxiety not to overload the child, eventually leading to a deplorable lack of information in adults and in college students; and that the school con centrates on so-called practical things, training for a job, and so misses education of the whole man. Being myself a product of old-fashioned Continental education, I know that learning irregular Greek verbs is somewhat less amusing than looking at television. But I wouldn't know of a lasting trauma it has caused, except in a certain class of European novels. It seems that the modern school system makes little use of the natural curiosity and inbuilt tendency to learn, going along with "function pleasure," of the child in his formative period. This appears to be one of the main reasons why "Johnny can't read" and the college or university teacher has such a hard time putting things into his students' heads which in their high-school period they rather would have had fun to learn, as it corresponds to a natural desire. This, of course, ties in with the problem of schooling of gifted children which is so much discussed nowadays. The enormity of this problem is apparent when I am quoting from the Manual of Child Psychology u- "·887 that about one percent of children have an I.Q. over 130, meaning that, in 1946, there were some 110,000 to 140,000 highly gifted children. Today, of course, the number would be even higher of children who, under the present system, are hamstrung or even destroyed in the natural unfolding of their abilities. Furthermore, there is what I have sometimes called culture as a psychohygienic factor. It is the utilitarian model which is at the basis</page><page sequence="10">22 MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY of schooling with "know-how" in a profession or trade as the ultimate goal. But perhaps it isn't so practical after all. Many educators agree to this. For example, I quote from a recent newspaper 10 which says that "America's sick society must rediscover the world of the mind if it is to thrive . . . One of every 20 persons in the United States is ex pected to enter a mental institution during his or her lifetime." And the writer goes on to underscore art education as a valuable means for developing better-balanced personalities. The same would apply to any sort of cultural activity in the broadest sense, from stamp collect ing to learning calculus in one's pastime. I would like to give a quo tation from an early novel by Aldous Huxley which admirably sum marizes this point. A young lady asks her lover: "Why shouldn't I neglect the Etruscans? What have they got to do with me—?" "Nothing, my child. Thank goodness they have got absolutely nothing to do with you, or me, or anybody else." "Then, why . . "Precisely for that reason. That's the definition of culture—knowing and thinking about things that have absolutely nothing to do with us. About Etruscans, for example; or the mountains on the moon; or cat's cradle among the Chinese; or the universe at large." These biological considerations naturally have alluded in some places to the apparent parallelisms which seem to exist between the individual development of the child and stages in the evolution of cultures. Phases like symbolistic preceding representative drawing, s, p. 113 thg relinquishing of an animistic way of thought, bravery,9·p·239 corresponding to an early heroic age in history, an adolescent sulking period with Sturm und Drang 9· p- 246—these all can readily be com pared with stages in the historical evolution of cultures. On the other hand, competent anthropologists like Margaret Mead 17 have warned against such easy comparisons. Now, nobody can realize better than the biologist the dangers of parallelizing the development of an in dividual and that of a culture. For this is, in somewhat different terms, the question of the so-called biogenetic law of the recapitulation of phylogeny in ontogenetic development, a problem that has been dis cussed exhaustively in biology for many decades. This material is immediately applicable to the analogue at the level of human develop ment, ethnology, and history. The outcome of these discussions in biology is something like this: We cannot speak of a recapitulation of evolution in embryonic development, that is, of individual develop ment as an abbreviated movie of phylogeny, undistorted and in the true temporal sequence. However, there is repetition of some ancestral traits or characters, though they may be severely altered and mixed up</page><page sequence="11">Fall, 1956 23 in their sequence, which occurs in ontogeny.12, 2· p173 The same seems to be true at the cultural level. We cannot expect cultural history to be recapitulated in the development of the individual, and we should abstain from making superficial inferences from one realm to the other. In some general way, however, distorted by new adaptations—what the biologist calls caenogenesis—and may be in a considerable se quential confusion, the individual and the civilization have to come to the same end, namely, the adult stage in the cultural period into which the individual is born. To this extent I think the parallelism exists and is illuminating. After all, individuals as well as cultures are living systems and they are born, grow, decay and die, according to some great, although hardly known law and plan. REFERENCES 1. Bayley, X.
