Printed in the Netherlands. 1 The Incorporate Bodies of Recombinant Capital EUGENE THACKER School of Literature, Communication, and Culture, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta Georgia 30332-0165, USA Cut-and-paste bodies In 1973, biochemist Herbert Boyer and molecular biologist Stanley Cohen published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, outlining their procedures for producing "recombinant DNA."1 Working separately at the University of California San Francisco, Boyer had developed a method for using "molecular scissors" - an enzyme known as a restriction endonuclease - to snip bacterial DNA at precise locations. Cohen, working at Stanford University, was simultaneously working on the use of bacterial plasmids - short loops of DNA in bacteria such as E. coli - as a kind of delivery system for novel segments of DNA. Together, Boyer and Cohen, along with other researchers, were central to the development of what became known as genetic engineering. Put simply, genetic engineering is based on the premise that the DNA of an organism can be re-shuffled and engineered; the tools of genetic engineering are the organism's own biology, and its tech? niques are based on the logic of cutting (restriction enzymes), pasting (DNA ligase enzymes), and replication (in the cellular divisions of the bacterial plasmid EcoRI). Boyer and Cohen had not only demonstrated that DNA could be artificially "collaged" into new hybrids, but they also demonstrated that this logic of cut-and-paste could operate across species. They had provided a technical logic for engineering at the molecular and genetic levels, and they had provided a set of powerful tools - many of which are still used - for carrying out genetic engineering research. There were several consequences of this research. Several years after Boyer and Cohen had published their recombinant DNA findings, both researchers patented their techniques for producing recombinant DNA, and they put together a business plan for a company to market these techniques. That company, called Genentech, garnered some $35 million from its IPO in 1980, and is often cited as the first true biotech company. Genentech - its name an abbreviation for "genetic engineering technology" - would focus on</page><page sequence="2">2 EUGENE THACKER the production of unique drugs and therapeutics through recombinant DNA techniques. It went on to produce a number of highly valuable products, including human insulin and human growth hormone, and many industry analysts point to the emergence of Genentech as the beginning of the first wave of the biotech industry.2 But beneath this apparent success story there are some important inter? sections to consider between bodies, technologies, and systems of value. Scientifically speaking, the recombinant DNA experiments of Boy er and Cohen signified an important shift within molecular biology research. While post-war developments in molecular biology were primarily geared towards producing knowledge about the organism on the genetic level (James Watson and Francis Crick's elucidation of the structure of DNA is a canonic example),3 the Boyer-Cohen experiments were focused on the develop? ment of techniques for working on and intervening in the organism. In a sense, such genetic engineering experiments are the first explicit examples of a "bio-technology": the technical design, engineering, and application of biological life. Although there is a long history of selective animal breeding, food preparation (e.g., fermentation), and agricultural techniques (e.g., ecological optimization of crops), the Boyer-Cohen experiments are the first such instances to effectively combine modern life science research with an engineering perspective, a paradigmatic look towards the technological control over the body-as-nature. However, the steps in this narrative of genetic engineering also illus? trate the degree to which "pure" research is never pure, but always networked through economic, institutional, and disciplinary zones: research and discovery, publishing and patenting, business start-up and IPO, and product development and medical application. These intersections are what Bruno Latour has described as "translation," or the production of cultural, scientific, social and technological mixtures and hybrids.4 The networks produced from such translations are often condensed into hybrid objects such as, in our case, recombinant DNA or transgenic organisms. Such hybrid articulations between organisms and technologies come to reflect and even? tually express the adaptability of the biotech economy, in turn affecting technology development and science research itself. In other words, if, on the one hand, we consider the scientific implications of recombinant DNA research - that the body can be "re-programmed" on the molecular level - we must also consider, on the other, the ways in which that capability to re-program is spliced with a business plan and an emerging industry. The dual events of recombinant DNA techniques, and the founding of Genentech, are indicative of the ways in which the biotech industry has been keenly aware of the ability to engineer biological matter so that it can generate both</page><page sequence="3">THE INCORPORATE BODIES OF RECOMBINANT CAPITAL 3 medical and economic value. In such an instance, a "cut-and-paste" body is less a cause for bioethical alarmism, and more an example of the ways in which bodies and economic value systems can accommodate each other.5 The cut-and-paste body of recombinant DNA technologies is a mode of flexible accumulation, the transformation of certain biomolecules into "wet" factories for the generation of a range of custom-tailored proteins. Recombinant DNA can not only surpass nature by providing the molecules nature does not, but it also forms a novel technological infrastructure, in which the body's "natural" processes (for instance, the production of insulin) can be recontextualized in a kind of upgraded, biomolecular black box. It is these connections between bodies, technologies, and economies that is the driving force of the current "biotech century." The example of Genentech not only points to the complex interrelationships between science, industry, and society, but it serves as a moment which illustrates the "encoding" of an economic logic directly into the biotechnological organism. As the new millennium gets underway, the biotech industry maintains many of the elements it did during the 1970s and 80s, but new factors have also transformed it into something quite different. Recombinant capital One of the major dynamics which characterizes the biotech industry presently is the privatization of molecular biology research, encapsulated in the biotech startup company. This so-called corporatization of biotech is illustrated by looking at the Human Genome Project (hereafter HGP). Originally a 15-year endeavor, the HGP was initiated in 1989, and is currently headed by various research insti? tutions in the U.S. and abroad.6 The HGP was, and still is, a "public domain" research project. It is supported by two large governmental bodies - the NHGRI (the National Human Genome Research Institute, part of the NIH) and the DoE (Department of Energy), in partnership with the Wellcome Trust in Britain. The push towards a public domain genome project has the attrac? tion, of course, of appearing to benefit the public generally, as this data may be used for a variety of research projects into the causes, cures, and prevention of gene-based diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, or Parkinson's. This publicly-funded genome project was joined, in 1998, by a small group of privately-funded genome projects, who positioned themselves in direct contrast to the publicly-funded HGP. Celera Genomics (who at the time became involved as TIGR - The Institute for Genomic Research) burst onto the biotech scene by claiming that it was initiating its own human genome project - and that it would complete the map of the human genome for</page><page sequence="4">4 EUGENE THACKER less money, and in less time, than the HGR Celera's claims were followed by Incyte Genomics, who also claimed to be initiating its own human genome project. In constructing their own genomes, both companies are adopting a subscription-only access model to their data, most of which is accessed by pharmaceutical companies for drug development. In addition, Human Genome Sciences, while not taking on the sequencing of the entire human genome, has instigated a series of patent claims for techniques and products based on genes sequenced within the human genome. Each of these corporations and their strategies - Celera's "whole genome shotgun sequenc? ing," Incyte's use of in-house microarray technologies, and Human Genome Science's short-cut strategy of gene patenting - offers a different approach to the molecular biology research that we've seen with the HGP; research does not happen without a business infrastructure.7 But the situation should be explicated in all its complexity. That is, while, in one sense, the bottom line for biotech startups is economics, it would be inaccurate to create of this situation a dichotomy, in which a greedy biotech corporation invades the public good of the federal genome project. The prac? tice of "patent then publish" has been a motto of university-based research for some time, and, while the links between research results and product devel? opment is more explicit within the biotech industry, major pharmaceutical companies have a long-standing tradition of developing products based on academic research. In addition, we need to also ask how "public" the HGP really is. Like the Manhattan Project before it, the HGP is a project of Western "big science," carried out by laboratories and research institutes mostly in the U.S. and Britain. The practice of collecting diverse genetic samples - most notoriously by the Human Diversity Genome Project - has been a common practice for molecular biologists and geneticists for some time.8 Thus the "public" benefit of the HGP of which President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair speak, is enframed within a narrative about current investments and a look towards promised results in the long term.9 Within the U.S., specula? tions on the availability of genetic drugs restrict such expensive treatments to a very small sector of the health care paying public. As most researchers concede, we are very far away from a genetic medicine Utopia in which genetically-designed drugs and gene therapies are commonplace medical practices. We might differentiate the biotech industry further by pointing to several trends. As is evident by looking at corporations such as Perkin-Elmer, Pfizer, Genzyme, or Millennium Pharmaceuticals, both biotech start-ups as well as "big pharma" are participating in the development of complex corporate bodies within the economic framework of global capitalism. A driving economic force is finance capital, bolstered from within by a wide range</page><page sequence="5">THE INCORPORATE BODIES OF RECOMBINANT CAPITAL 5 of "future promises" from bioteeh research (gene therapies, genetic drugs, and so on). The emphasis we are witnessing now in "digital capitalism," to use Dan Schiller's term, is an intersection of economic systems with infor? mation technology.10 As Michael Dawson and John Bellamy Foster show, this trend leads to an emphasis on a "total marketing strategy" that is highly diversified: consumer profiling, individualized marketing, "narrowcasting," "push-media" and so on.11 Such trends are transforming medical research as well. More often than not, the future of a research field within bioteeh can flourish or perish depending on the tides of stock values. In turn, those stock values are directly tied to the proclaimed successes or failures of clinical trials or research results. Most of the stock value of the bioteeh industry is an example of what Catherine Waldby calls "biovalue": either with their being able to produce valuable research results that can be transformed into products (such as genetic-based drugs or therapies), or their ability to take research and mobilize it within a product development pipeline (mostly within the domain of the pharmaceutical industry).12 However, the most significant factor for our concerns here is that the bioteeh industry is, along with bioteeh research itself, becoming an informa? tion science, an informatics. As Ben Rosen, chairman of Compaq has stated, "Biology is becoming an information science ... and it will take increas? ingly powerful computers and software to gather, store, analyze, model and distribute that information."13 The advent of advanced computer-based tools, the Web, and, soon after, a proliferation of e-commerce models, has meant that computer technology offers the exemplary site for the continued exten? sion of biotechnology as a model for future research, and as a business model. Within bioteeh research such as the HGP, the generation of endless amounts of genetic sequence data, as well as endless amounts of genes to be analyzed, has necessitated the incorporation of computer science into scientific analysis in a field known as "bioinformatics." The fastest growing discipline within bioteeh, bioinformatics provides the informational infra? structure wherein the production of scientific knowledge or biovalue can take place. The most prevalent example of bioinformatics has been data basing - where, for instance, up-to-the-minute information on the HGP can be accessed by researchers worldwide via a website and access to a central data? base. But bioinformatics also includes complex analysis systems, molecular and protein modeling applications, "gene discovery systems," data mining tools, and the development of simulation environments in order to further study the function of genes and pathways.14 As we've pointed out, the bioinformatics of database access is inextri? cably connected, in biotechnology, to software and subscription models for</page><page sequence="6">6 EUGENE THACKER research, and this is where bio-informatics intersects with bio-capitalism, or the integration of genetic bodies into an advanced capitalist framework. Discussing the free-floating dynamics of late capital, Fredde Jameson notes that the self-referential feedback loops of finance capital propel it into a zone of "autonomization," a virus-like epidemic that forms a speculation on speculations.15 For Jameson this has resulted in "the cybernetic 'revolution,' the intensification of communications technology to the point at which capital transfers today abolishes space and time and can be virtually instantaneously effectuated from one national zone to another." It is this instantaneousness and total connectivity that has driven many labs to fully incorporate advanced computing and networking technologies (such as Celera), and it is this integration of bio-tech with info-tech which has brought companies such as IBM, Compaq, and Sun Microsystems into the lifesciences. If, in the biotech industry, finance capital and laboratory research are interconnected, how does this transform the "wet," biological materials in the lab, the molecular bodies of life science research? One response is to suggest that it is in the unique, hybrid objects of the biotech industry - genomic databases, DNA chips, automated protein analysis computers - that genetic bodies and a "digital capitalism" intersect. In other words, the correlations between bodies and capital, which enables a biotech industry to exist at all, are currently mediated by computer and information technologies. The use of such technologies is predicated on the assumption that a range of equivalencies can be established between, say, a patented genetic sequence and the marketing of that sequence through genetic-based drugs. Our opening example of Genentech illustrates this, in the correlation between the molecular "tools" of the cell (the enzymes for cutting and pasting genes), and the novel molecules produced through those tools (Genentech's human insulin product). The example of Genentech and recombinant DNA technology is also helpful for another reason. The science behind Genentech - recombinant DNA technologies - is based on the ability to strategically insert, re-insert, and recombine genetic sequences to attain a desired end (for instance, the production of a novel protein). Genentech is an example of a constant modulation of the generative potentials of both science research and capital accumulation; this is hyper-marketing and product management infused with laboratory technique. Boyer and Cohen's challenge in forming Genentech was not about making "health" or health care marketable; it was about creating a context in which both science research and capital accumu? lation would be reciprocally sensitive to each other, with a common goal of maximizing profits (medical and economic). Current biotech companies have realized this, and this is one explanation why the biotech industry is focusing</page><page sequence="7">THE INCORPORATE BODIES OF RECOMBINANT CAPITAL 7 so heavily on the production of "silver bullet" drugs, and side-stepping more complex, "messy" approaches such as systems biology. Because this logic of correlating bodies and value inserts itself at multiple sites within the biotech industry (just as a recombinant gene can insert itself in multiple ways within a strand of DNA), we might do better to refer to this fusion of corporate biotechnology and information technology, as "recom? binant capital." Recombinant capital is not just the prevalence of online stock fluctuations, speculations, and losses; it is a diverse business model which deals with the informatics of biotechnology. At its root, recombinant capital and bioinformatics both begin with the world-view that everything is information. Or, to be more specific, that the world can be reduced to informational pattern, a pattern which identifies the "essence" of, in this case, the human body. Such a process involves a level of technical sophistication (for example, in converting DNA samples into computer databases), but more than that, it requires a constant process of correlation between medical value and economic value. In an example such as the genome databases of Celera or Incyte, the process of converting DNA samples into databases is also a process of creating a relationship between medical value (a possible gene target for a cancer drug) and economic value (the profit potential of such a gene when it is patented). Whether a sequence of DNA in the lab, or a computer-generated stock profile of a gene, whether medical value or stock value, it is information and information technologies which enable genetic sequences to be decoded, and which enable online interactions within the market to fluctuate and interact. Thus, we might say that the balancing act in the biotech industry between medical and economic value is mediated by information technologies, which, by converting everything into data, can establish modes of correlating different value systems. This mode of informatic abstraction means that, technically speaking, both recombinant capital and bioinformatics operate according to an encoding processing-decoding protocol. For example, a bioinformatics approach to database management for one of the research centers in the HGP proceeds by developing a way to translate genetic information into computer information. Once that genetic body is encoded as computer information, it can then be reconfigured and organized into a database structure. Likewise, recombinant capital also encodes the genetic body, but through a much more diluted manner. Many online hubs for the biotech industry list, side by side, a daily update of research results or discoveries and stock quotes.16 As may be expected, glowing reports on phase III clinical trials for a gene-based drug will show significant rises in stocks, while a failed merger between two companies might show a decline. For example, the announce? ment in March of 2000 by President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair that</page><page sequence="8">8 EUGENE THACKER genomic sequence data should be "freely available to all" triggered a panicky downward slide in biotech stocks, especially in those companies like Celera and Incyte who have built their entire stock portfolio on a genomic database subscription model.17 The Clinton-Blair announcement is important not for what it said (it said nothing new of course) but for what it demonstrated polit? ically: a certain point of crisis in the discourse of biotech in the correlations between medical and economic value systems. This is one level of recombinant capital - that of online stock fluctuations, often in direct correlation with either laboratory research results or offline scientific discourse. But stock value must first be developed, or cultured, so that an influx of stock investment can occur in the first place, and this is the level where laboratory research becomes more fully integrated with economic interest. For a biotech startup, there must of course be something to "sell," something to garner the attention of potential investors and the envy of competitor companies. This can be a product - certainly "owning" the genome will be an asset - but it can also be a service or technique - such as genetic analysis or genetic profiling. It can also be related to technology development - such as silicon-based microarrays or DNA chips. Bioinformatics carries this the next step, as the traditional biological "wet" labs become more computerized, with the advent of "labs-on-a-chip." That is, once genetics can be successfully translated into a problem of informatics, programming, and digital encoding, working with biological materials in the lab becomes abstracted into working with code on a monitor. As with other restricted access e-commerce models, the most in-demand data will be the most valuable, and even the most costly to access/download. This will create a real-time value assessment model in which each click by a researcher will correspond in some way to the fluctuations of value in the data accessed, as well as the overall value of the company hosting the database. In this situation, the database subscription business model is simultaneously research, and real-time stock and pricing adjustment. The end result is that the most expensive and most costly research will be dictated first by economic negotiations, secondly by data access privileges, and last by a consideration of the disease or gene being studied. The trends which are clearly foreseeable here is that research done on certain genes or gene based drugs will prosper, only because they yield from the beginning a low-risk, cost-effective guarantee of success in clinical trials, FDA approval, and market utility. More complex diseases such as AIDS, or the study of more complex biochemical pathways (in which genes are NOT the central component), will be assessed as high-risk endeavors, highly unpredictable, and unlikely to turn any returns in the near future. A shift in research will then be encouraged, from knowledge-based medical models of healing, to the</page><page sequence="9">THE INCORPORATE BODIES OF RECOMBINANT CAPITAL 9 full-fledged investment in temporary, genetically-specific drugs which have their own obsolescence built-in. However this is critical speculation based on current trends; does the biotech industry really have anything to sell to begin with? The new dotcom When we speak about the biotech "industry," this is, in some ways, a misleading description. On the most literal level, biotech has rarely been about "industry" or industrial modes of production; even the early interests in chemical engineering and food biotechnology is today built upon techniques and modifications, and not products (that is, in contrast to standard production models, biotech foods are "genetically-modified").18 Research in biotech is more explicit on this point. At the recent BIO 2000 convention in Boston, one panel dealt with the discrepancies between biotech research and production.19 While on the research end there is no shortage of ideas, experiments, and novel techniques, on the production end Big Pharma has yet to deliver on this potential of biotechnology to spark a genetic medicine "revolution." Obstacles such as the excessive amount of clinical data which must be analyzed and correlated before products can be developed are in part responsible for this lag between research and product development. While research labs and biological supply companies are able to output large quantities of needed cells, genes, DNA segments, sequence clones, and other tools of research, there have been large bottlenecks at the product development and consumer ends. But if biotech is not an "industry" proper, if it is not based in the develop? ment of products and services utilized in medical practice, if it is not about the development of novel pharmaceuticals - if biotech does not overtly "produce" anything for medical practice - what then is it? We can begin by outlining three main kinds of companies within the biotech industry: First, what are often called "pick-and-shovel" companies, mostly in the technology and laboratory supply sector, which provide the tools for research. Like the original pick-and-shovel business during the California gold rush, such companies implicitly believe that, while the actual genome may not yield any profits, the need for research technologies on it will. These companies are generally the lowest risk-takers, though radical new tools such as microarrays can be risky, unless they quickly take off (as has happened with microarrays). An example is Affymetrix, which is one of the leading suppliers of microarrays, or DNA chips, for large-scale, efficient sequencing. Secondly, there are the software/service companies, who operate mostly on the level of computer technology, software, and network applications.</page><page sequence="10">10 EUGENE THACKER These companies often provide a counterpart to the pick-n-shovel companies by providing the software tools necessary to complete the work done by pick n-shovel hardware. Such companies can offer software packages (such as Incyte's "LifeSeq" sequencing and analysis software package), they can offer data analysis services (these are mostly computer and network business), or they can offer access to a database on a subscription-only basis (as the private genome companies such as Celera are doing). Finally, there are what we might call the product-makers, those companies - usually large pharmaceutical corporations - who take the information generated by the second group (say, the information generated by Celera on the human genome), and transform it into an array of products, services, and practical techniques. The most prevalent among these is Big Pharma and the emphasis in such companies on drug development and gene therapy-based drug treatments (or "pharmacogenomics"). A consideration of these types of companies not only illustrates the degree to which biotech has become infotech, but it also suggests that the future success of the biotech industry is dependent on the ability to generate value out of the data collected from biological material. All of this is predi? cated on the assumption that biological bodies - tissues, cells, molecules, chromosomes, genes - can be unproblematically translated into data. Such a move indicates the degree to which biotech relies upon the notion of a stable "content" in the genome, irrespective of its material instantiation (be it in cells or in computer databases).20 Recombinant capital demands that everything within biotech have an informatic equivalent; it does not, like biotech research, demand that everything be translated into information, but it does demand a direct link between genetic bodies and relevant data. Recombinant capital touches the population, not through direct genomic database management, but more indirectly through the commodification of such databases. As biotech becomes increasingly privatized, the database corporations such as Celera or Incyte will become the main bio-commerce brokers. At issue is not the buying or selling of databases, but the generative potential of genetic data; in such a case ethnic population genome data? bases, individualized SNP or genetic screening databases, and various animal genome databases important for human medicine, will all become sources of a biopolitical management. A biovaluation of all values As a way of looking at this network between bodies, data, and value, consider the recent strategy employed by some biotech companies to develop participatory models for DNA sampling. During the summer of 2000, DNA</page><page sequence="11">THE INCORPORATE BODIES OF RECOMBINANT CAPITAL 11 Solutions, Inc. announced the creation of the Gene Trust, the first, large scale, organized DNA-sample bank.21 Based on a volunteer-model, interested individuals can register and send in blood samples for DNA analysis and archiving. As an information-business, The Gene Trust will gather genetic samples from a range of individuals, with a range of medical conditions. Such information will help pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories to speed up the process of therapeutics, drug development, and clinical trials. While, on the research and development side, the Gene Trust is exemplary of many biotech endeavors, on the consumer/patient side, it is at the forefront of producing a new type of relationship between medical practice and the biomedical patient. In short, the patient or consumer - who supposedly takes part in and ultimately benefits from the Gene Trust - enters into a unique relationship with his/her own information. The medical patient becomes a "data patient." The data patient is characterized by several constraints, all of which relate to the relationship between patient body and the medical use of computer technology. First, the physical, biological body of the medical patient must be translatable into computer-based information. Anything that cannot be encoded will either be designated as supplemental, or fully excised from the data patient's profile. All medical diagnosis, treatment, and communication in the telemedical context will then take place via information and information technology. This means that even personal consultation may involve remote physicians or technicians. One of the top priorities of medical treatment will therefore be the dataset relating to the patient. Additionally, the data patient will constantly be mirrored by an electronic double, their digital profile. In a sense, the real patient will have to constantly negotiate with this data-double, so that they correspond to each other. This does not only mean changing the data in computers, especially when that data is used to make important health-related decisions. The cycle starts when the medical patient's genetic body is sampled and encoded. From there a loop is initiated, in which the patient's biological body must always first answer to his or her telemedical profile. The types of drugs needed, the types of therapy best suited to this patient, will be decided at the level of informatics first and foremost (this is the basic logic of "pharma cogenomics"). The patient's biological body will have been diagnosed and treated with no mention of the phenomenal condition of embodiment, the blatant gap which currently exists between "wet" genetic molecules and digital codes, or the dynamic and flexible quality of the body. The point here is not to simply go back to those pre-computer days of Galenic bedside medicine, endlessly listening to the patient's testimonies. But we should also be very astute in assessing the ways in which this complex of</page><page sequence="12">12 EUGENE THACKER biological science and information technology structures a certain narrative of progress. The data-patient in genetic therapeutics and telemedicine presents us with a classical case of Baudrillardian simulation, where the simulacrum not only verifies the real (what is real comes to be what can be perfectly simulated), but the simulacrum also threatens to blur the very real/simulated distinction.22 Because patient data cycles back upon and ultimately affects the physical, real patient, there is a confusion of where to locate the object of medical attention; in a sense the real patient is preceded by the data-patient. As its name indicates, the Gene Trust represents itself as a form of volun? tary, altruistic investment. As a long-standing legal concept, a "trust" involves a relationship between a property owner, and a property manager, where the latter is entrusted with the property of the former, with benefits going primarily to the property owner (in the same way that one entrusts one's finances or one's business to someone else). Economically speaking, an investment trust (also called a closed-end trust) involves a financial organization which gathers the funds of its share? holders, and then invests them in a diversified securities portfolio. Simply put, securities (such as stocks) confer ownership of something which is not in the owner's immediate possession; it is a means of rendering property, and materiality, virtual. The owner of a stock can, theoretically, demand the right to receive the property designated in the stock, or, of course, the stock can be traded. As such, stocks can take on a free-floating fluidity - as informational value units - which significantly, if only momentarily, detaches them from any material substantiation. Most investment trusts hand over the majority of the management and control of the funds to the financial organization. With a fixed number of shares, the value of the portfolio will depend on the status of the supply and demand for certain types of shares in the market. We are already witnessing a massive virtualization of finance capital (the actual technological implementation in e-trading is, perhaps, only its latest phase). What happens when we consider an investment trust based on the body? As patenting debates in the past have illustrated, one of the first transformations is that the body becomes, more specifically, biological prop? erty. Bodies as objects certainly have their own convoluted history (in labor, sexuality, cultural stereotyping, etc.), but in the case of the Gene Trust the body is simultaneously genetic and informatic. It is genetic because what the Gene Trust is interested in is not personal testimony, patient-described symp? toms, or even past medical records. The Gene Trust is centrally interested in a molecular pattern that is commonly "read" as a sequence of letters. In contemporary biotech research, that also means that DNA is translated into information, for computer-based analysis and diagnostics. This is a kind of body, framed by informatic and economic concerns, which we might call</page><page sequence="13">THE INCORPORATE BODIES OF RECOMBINANT CAPITAL 13 a "bioinformatic body." As the basic logic of the legal trust indicates, the ownership of this biological property is defined by its absence (the stock holder does not actually have the property designated in the stock). The Gene Trust's central asset will be its databases and the diagnostic and medical information it can tease out of that genetic data. What the Gene Trust volunteer donates is less their body and more bioinformatic value. Under a broad category of medical altruism, the Gene Trust promises a future of humanistic returns (the DNA sample you supply now could save a life in the future). In the meanwhile, the more short-term circulation of bio-data enables the Gene Trust, as a privately-funded venture, to gain immediate economic returns. The Gene Trust, though it may communicate the best of intentions, actu? ally has a two-fold agenda, in that is means "investment" in two different ways. First and foremost, the Gene Trust presents itself through a rhetoric of an altruistic, biomedical humanism. The investment alluded to here is made possible by the over-arching category of collective human well-being. At its basis is a biological essentialism, which implies that, because we are all the same genetically, volunteering for the Gene Trust is an investment in the future of human health. In fact, the sound-bite advertising phrases on the website push forth micro-narratives (the young woman whose aunt has Alzheimer's, gaining a sense of "participating in history" by helping researchers combat disease). All of us have had some experience with the often traumatic effects of disease and death of those close to us. Despite this, however, neither the human genome projects, nor its spin-offs such as the Gene Trust, have mentioned the fact that scientific research still does not know for sure whether genes "cause" devastating diseases such as cancer. And, the complex effects of biological networks, as well as environmental influences, has yet to be considered in a serious manner by researchers. What are the dynamics of change when a novel technology is introduced, via recombinant capital, into biotech research? The introduction of biologic informatic hybrids as part and parcel of biotech research has meant something different; it has meant that the data produced through biotech research always has a direct, linear, and causal relationship to the development of systems for generating biovalue (mostly with pharmaceutical corporations and genetic drug development). We can see this not only in the primary interests of DNA chips (efficiency, cost-effectiveness, instantaneous results), but in the kinds of data they produce, suited for their adaptive utilization in genetic drugs and preventive medicine.23 In this sense, the data produced by DNA chip and related technologies resembles demographics or statistics: a selected range of analytical categories (gene sequence, gene frequency, iterative patterns) together composes a genetic profile of a DNA sample. Once a greater number</page><page sequence="14">14 EUGENE THACKER of genes are "discovered" to have direct and indirect relationships to a wide range of "disorders," it is only a step towards seeing something like DNA chips as sociobiological surveillance systems, biopolitical modes of regulating, and accounting for, individuals and populations. Thus, one of the primary issues in projects such as The Gene Trust, is the ways in which recombinant capital can adaptively insert itself into a range of contexts, from hard lab research to the highest ethers of finance capital. In doing so, it scans, cuts, and recombines the resources inherent in fields such as genomics, articulating them as information-based solutions to an ideology whereby disease is fully accounted for through genes. For recom? binant capital, sociobiological perspectives allow for the quick development of commercial health care models which are based on a simple model of mechanical addition or blockage through genetic drugs. Non-organic life? The rhetoric of DNA-as-information is now a given in biotech research, as it is in textbooks and even popular culture (consider the recent films Gattaca or The Sixth Day). Despite the concerted efforts by many researchers to state that the individual is not, in fact, determined by their DNA, a powerful cultural mytheme has developed around the centrality of DNA in forming the individual and collective (species) subject. Many critics have brought up the problems inherent in this information-based view of genetic life, and, as Evelyn Fox Keller and Lily Kay have shown, the notion of a genetic "code" emerges out of a complex set of historical, institutional, and disci? plinary contexts during the post-war era.24 One of the central tensions in this consideration of a genetic code or a genetic program is the dichotomy it sets up between organic and non-organic matter. While science fiction has given us many intelligent machines, there is still a basic division between carbon based and silicon-based systems, the former assumedly existing "in nature" (that is, supposedly pre-existing technology), and the latter an invention of human beings. In an essay on "non-organic life," Manuel DeLanda suggests that recent research into chaos and self-organizing systems (from phenomena of cloud patterns, to wave solitons, to "chemical clocks") forms a significant paradigm shift in the traditional notions of what is meant by living and non-living.25 DeLanda shows that such systems, which display complex patterning and dynamic interactions with their environment, are more than automated reac? tions. They show how dynamic processes such as bifurcations, attractors, and so on can create the condition for self-organization and emergence - in effect, these "non-organic" systems display evolutionary patterning. As DeLanda</page><page sequence="15">THE INCORPORATE BODIES OF RECOMBINANT CAPITAL 15 states, "what is important for our purposes, though, is that both periodic and nonperiodic oscillations and coherent structures are among the unexpected possible behaviors of 'inert' matter, behaviors of which we have only become recently aware. Matter, as it turns out, can 'express' itself in complex and creative ways .. ."26 When combined with research into cognitive science and artificial intel? ligence, the boundary between the living and non-living becomes even more blurred. The direction which DeLanda takes, however, does not simply cul? minate in the anthropomorphic, humanist subject. Instead, geological forma? tions, crowds, insects, highways, sand dunes, computer networks, cell meta? bolism, and the economy each display unique sets of dynamic structuration which, from one perspective, might contentiously be called "life." We might then suggest that what I have been calling recombinant capital is a symptom of a more fundamental crisis concerning the boundary manage? ment between the living and non-living. The biotech industry needs to effectively separate the human and technological, the living and non-living, in order that bio-technologies can be clearly seen as simple, non-threatening tools or medicines in the service of the betterment of human health. While this is a noble cause, and while motive is not the issue here, this kind of separation is simply not possible if we begin to consider the actual tech? niques, technologies, and the discourse of informatics which pervade current research. The confusion between medical value and economic value can thus be seen as a confusion between organic and non-organic systems. One of the things which the current integration of information technology and biotech? nology has brought us is the challenge of rethinking the still-active vitalist ideology in the life sciences. The question is not whether or not vitalist-based approaches to life are in themselves good or bad; the question is whether the ideological division between living and non-living which vitalist thought highlights is the best approach to dealing with contemporary biotech. This is especially so in biotechnology research, where blood and tissue samples, DNA sequencing computers, "immortalized" stem cells, online genomic databases, and an array of biological-technological hybrids are in the process of redefining the conventional distinctions between humans and machine, nature and technics.

While the recombinant DNA research during the 1970s instigated public outcry at scient? ists "playing God," and while such public anxieties led to some formalized, bioethical debate (for instance, the "Asilomar conferences" held in California in 1973 and 1975), what was left un-problematized was the direct connections between research science, governmental sanctioning, and bioscience business (patenting, marketing, investment).
