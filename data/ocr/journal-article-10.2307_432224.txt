<plain_text><page sequence="1">KIRK PILLOW Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill: Two Views on Metaphor in Kant Metaphor-makers wrench concepts from their customary uses in order to propose af- finities that our habits of conceptual sorting overlook. They defy conceptual rules by ap- plying terms beyond their accepted domains, as in the claim "love is war," where "war" il- lumines a world of romance beyond its ken. But however much a metaphor tests a con- cept's purview, it remains a conceptual prac- tice through and through. It gets nowhere without the concepts that it puts to uncanny use, though it misapplies them to produce lit- erally false statements (typically). Yet in the very moment of falsehood we think our met- aphors contribute to understanding, broadly construed, even as we toy with the concepts on whose legitimate application our knowl- edge is based. Metaphors have historically been con- ceived as the products of a creative imagina- tion. It has long been a badge of philosophi- cal honor to warn against metaphor, and the playful imagination that speaks in it, as dan- gerous distractions from the noble labor of knowing. Thus did Hobbes claim that meta- phors violate good judgment because they "openly professe deceipt; to admit them into Councell, or Reasoning," he warned, "were manifest folly."l Similarly did Locke, court- ing danger by resorting to a metaphor, con- demn all figurative uses of language as "per- fect cheats" to be avoided "where truth and knowledge are concerned."2 If metaphors were but flights of fancy, their status in rela- tion to cognition would be as lowly as Hobbes and Locke thought. That status has remained perennially contested, however, precisely because metaphors do contribute something to understanding, and in virtue of their conceptual mischief. Metaphors extend understanding even as the products of an aesthetic imagination, and they thus make their cognitive contribution from the wrong side of the tracks, as it were. If modern thought has endeavored to separate aes- thetic experience from cognition and its knowledge, metaphor should be seen as a key instance where an imagination engaged in aesthetic play leaps the divide to make claims for an understanding of things unsay- able in literal conceptual discourse. Immanuel Kant certainly did his part to establish our modern separation of aesthetic and cognitive experience. I want to explore Kant's views on metaphor in order to at- tempt a better understanding of it as an imaginative product and of its status as such in relation to cognition. Such an aim would be hindered by the fact that Kant does not actually discuss metaphor explicitly in his Critique of Judgment aesthetic theory, were it not for the fact that several scholars have discerned a nascent theory of metaphor in that work. Exploring Kant's views on meta- phor will reveal not only that he is one of the few modern philosophers for whom meta- phors are philosophically honorable; we will also find that his thinking prefigures the most successful current perspective on meta- phor, known broadly as "interactionism." I will argue, in fact, that Kant forwards no less than two conceptions of metaphor; they must be carefully distinguished, for they have quite different implications. Deter- mining how in Kant's case metaphor navi- gates the gap between imaginative play and The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 59:2 Spring 2001</page><page sequence="2">194 sober cognition will help us assess not only the claims of metaphor but also the legiti- macy of this gap it traverses. I. METAPHOR AND KANTIAN SYMBOLS Section 59 of the Critique of Judgment, "On Beauty as the Symbol of Morality," provides an account of metaphor in the guise of what Kant calls symbolic exhibition. Exhibition or hypotyposis-the vivid sketching or illustra- tion of an idea-involves providing an intu- ition that matches up with a concept and confirms its objective reference. In the case of an empirical concept, such as "dog," an in- tuited or experienced example confirms the concept's reality. When it comes to an a pri- ori concept or category of the understanding, its sketching intuition or schema is given along with it a priori. Kant argues in the first Critique, of course, that the a priori temporal schematization of a category, as in the construal of "substance" as "permanence in time," guarantees the universal objectivity of the concept.4 Kant indicates there that even with empirical concepts, schemata play a role in linking abstractions to real particulars. A concept such as "dog," Kant writes, "always stands in relation to the schema of imagina- tion, as a rule for the determination of our intuition, in accordance with some specific universal concept" (CPR A141/B180). Pre- sumably such schematic exhibition only guarantees the objectivity of a concept in the a priori cases, since we might possess an imaginative schema for an empirical con- cept, such as "unicorn," whose reality would only be confirmed by an actual, intuited ex- ample. If schematic exhibition provides "direct" and "demonstrative" illustration of concepts, symbolic exhibition fleshes out ideas via the indirect route of analogy. Instead of provid- ing an intuition that literally embodies the content of the concept, symbolic exhibition appeals to an incongruent entity whose con- cept shares analogical features with the orig- inal. Symbolic exhibition, according to Kant, "performs a double function: it applies the concept to the object of a sensible intuition; and then it applies the mere rule by which it reflects on that intuition to an entirely differ- The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism ent object, of which the former object is only the symbol" (CJ, Ak. 352). Kant illustrates this obscure formula with his famous anal- ogy between a despotic state and a hand mill. Even though the intuition of a hand mill (imagine a food mill or ricer) bears no direct relation to despotism or any concept of gov- ernment, the action of the mill in grinding down resisting objects can symbolize the overlording power of the despotic state. The isomorphism lies not in their respective ap- pearances, which share no similarity; it lies instead in a similarity between "the rules by which we reflect on the two and on their cau- sality" (ibid.).5 The proportional analogy at work could be specified as: The material fed through a hand mill is to its operator as the subjects under an absolute monarchy are to the despot.6 The analogy does not license the inference that a despotic state is (literally) a machine, like the hand mill, so the intuition deployed in the analogy is not informing us about despotism directly. Instead, the anal- ogy only suggests a rule covering the rela- tionship of cause and effect present in each set of relations (cf. CJ, Ak. 464 n). We imag- ine an agent feeding material into the mill as she or he turns its handle, and we conceive a rule for the actions and consequences or ef- fects involved, which we transfer to the do- main of government and its leaders. The analogy gives flesh to our understanding of the abstract notion "despotism," not to men- tion that it dramatizes our assessment of the institution. Kant in fact distinguishes two kinds of proportional analogy. Quantitative analogies in mathematics allow one to infer a fourth term D from the ratio A:B::C:D when A, B, the relation between them, and C are known (cf. CPR A179/B222). Such an analogy, or proportion, is constitutive of the value of D; that is, it allows one to determine D's exact magnitude. If I know that the relation be- tween 2 and 4 in the ratio 2:4::3:x is multipli- cative, then I know that x is precisely 6. A qualitative analogy, to contrast, does not pro- vide determinate knowledge of the fourth term. The rule it does provide expresses "only the relation to a fourth, but not this fourth member itself" (ibid.), so the only de- terminate content of the analogy is the iso-</page><page sequence="3">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 195 morphic, relational rule it captures (the fact that the rule-content is determinate will be- come important below). This rule aids in "seeking the fourth member in experience" (CPR A180/B222). The hand mill analogy, for example, aids in the identification of des- pots: when you see a state apparatus man- gling its subjects' freedoms the way a hand mill crushes through force, you know you are dealing with a tyrant. The distinction be- tween quantitative and qualitative analogy must be noted, because, as some commenta- tors have stressed, only the latter functions in symbolic exhibition.7 Symbolic exhibition takes on major signif- icance for Kant in cases where it offers the only purchase available to us in our reflec- tions on the supersensibles picked out by ra- tional ideas. "All our cognition of God is merely symbolic" (CJ, Ak. 353), which means, for example, that we think of a divine creative power through an analogy with the human production of artifacts. Kant defines the rational idea as "a concept to which no intuition (presentation of the imagination) can be adequate" (CJ, Ak. 314), so of course no schema, much less any empirical example, can establish its objective reality.8 The first Critique maintains that the idea of God, as well as the idea of unconditioned freedom, must be conceived by finite rational beings for certain practical purposes; even so, such beings cannot have knowledge of the exis- tence of anything determinately correspond- ing to these ideas. Short of an exemplary or schematic exhibition of such ideas, the only means available for fleshing out their signifi- cance is through symbols, that is, through an- alogically expressive intuitions.9 This indi- cates that, for Kant, those of our efforts to peer beyond the limits of possible experi- ence that can be sanctioned by practical rea- son view the supersensible through a sym- bolic, and so analogical, lens. If a nascent theory of metaphor is present in Kant's ac- count of analogical symbols, metaphors (conceived as analogies) will have deep sig- nificance for the aims of the critical project.10 For section 59 of the third Critique, it is the intuition of beauty, of course, that offers a symbolic exhibition of the (directly unintuitable) rational idea of the morally good. In the appreciation of beauty, we expe- rience, Kant thinks, a direct and disinterested liking reflective of a capacity for judging uni- versally, free from the influence of merely sensuous charms. Moral reflection similarly involves the production of universal rules free from the influence of inclination, and so aesthetic experience offers an intuitive em- bodiment of the self-legislative vocation of practical reason (CJ, Ak. 353-354). Through this analogy, "Taste enables us, as it were, to make the transition from sensible charm to a habitual moral interest without making too violent a leap . . . " (CJ, Ak. 354). We saw above that the determinate rule-content of a qualitative analogy is typically a causal rela- tionship between ground and consequent that is present on both sides of the analogy. In the case of aesthetic and moral experi- ence, the common causative ground is a free productivity of universal norms, of taste in the former case and of the moral law in the latter. The proportional analogy expresses an isomorphism between the effect, an expe- rience of beauty, brought about by the free causality of taste and the effect, the moral good, brought about by the free causality of practical reason. Because the analogy oper- ating in beauty's symbolization of morality involves a free human production of beau- ties, Munzel has made an interesting case that the creation of works of art, rather than our appreciation of beauty in nature, truly models the rule-content of the analogy. If this is correct, then it is the beauty we find in art specifically that provides an intuitive em- bodiment of practical autonomy.11 With this sketch in place, one can easily discern an account of metaphor in Kant's theory of symbolic exhibition.12 Metaphors have been construed as implicit analogies since Aristotle, who characterized metaphor as "the application [to something] of a name belonging to something else," most impor- tantly (though not exclusively) through the use of analogy.13 Kant's own language mir- rors this formulation. A symbol works as " . . . a transfer of our reflection on an object of in- tuition to an entirely different concept" (CJ, Ak. 352-353); this transference (metaphora) is the etymological core of the meaning of "metaphor." On this traditional view, the</page><page sequence="4">196 hand mill Kant calls a symbol might as easily be called a metaphor for despotism, as in "the despotic state is a machine." On such a view, a metaphor would simply be an anal- ogy with the "ratio" it expresses left implicit for its audience to unpack. Beauty would be a metaphor for morality, whose meaning can be unpacked by specifying the rule-content at the core of the analogy relating the two, just as Kant unpacks it in section 59. However "natural" it might be to regard Kantian symbols as metaphors, this interpre- tation comes at a price. For one, Kant would get little credit for shedding light on how metaphors work if his remarks merely re- peated Aristotelian doctrine. Causabon might be fascinated to learn that Kant fol- lowed Aristotle on this point, but the discov- ery would not gain the rest of us much. What is perhaps remarkable about the "meta- phoricity" of Kantian symbols is the role this accords "metaphor" in all the Kantian sub- ject's reflections on intuitively indetermin- able rational ideas, and hence on the enact- ment of practical freedom. As Kleingeld has shown, Kantian reason's pursuit of its moral vocation must be articulated through meta- phors of rational needs and interests.14 This means that certain "metaphors" serve an in- dispensable function not only in moral re- flection, but also in the architectonic intelli- gibility of Kant's thought. This result loses some of its power, however, if one notes that each mention of "metaphor" above can be readily replaced with "analogy," since Kantian symbols may be called "metaphors," but only because they are essentially analo- gies. Kant's symbols are metaphors only if one accepts that metaphors are fundamen- tally analogical. The grand tradition of argu- ment by analogy also takes its cue from Aris- totle, so Kant's way of making room for reference to the supersensible in the critical philosophy employs one of the metaphysical tradition's most ancient methods. If this is right, then again Kant has added little to our understanding of how metaphors work. Perhaps more importantly, the venerable pedigree of the metaphor-as-implicit-anal- ogy thesis obscures the fact that the most so- phisticated contemporary theories of meta- phor reject the Aristotelian view as The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism inadequate.'5 The problem with construing metaphor in analogical terms is that an anal- ogy can be reduced to a comparison, specifi- cally to a complex simile. Beauty can sym- bolize morality because aesthetic experience is like moral reflection, owing to the disinter- ested and free universality common to both. Kant enumerates four ways in which they are alike (at CJ, Ak. 353-354), and as Paul Guyer has noted, Kant's fleshing out of the analogy "should exhaust the content of the assertion that beauty is the symbol of moral- ity."116 In other words, the metaphorical meaning of a Kantian symbol can be deter- minately and completely specified by the rule-content of the analogy. The implication is that tying the meaning of a metaphor to a rule specifying a comparison violates the inexhaustibility of metaphorical meaning that current theories uphold. A metaphor such as "Juliet is the sun" can mean all of a variety of things that no single interpretive rule could encompass. No construal could es- tablish its meaning with finality, so the rule-boundedness of Kantian symbols falls short of the richness that current thought at- tributes to much metaphorical language. So however indispensable certain "metaphors" (symbols) may be for the Kantian subject's exhibition of rational ideas, their meaning is not inexhaustible or open-ended, because their meaning is fixed by the analogy. Kant's theory of the symbol also differs from current thinking on the extent of cre- ativity attributed to metaphorical under- standing. If a metaphor merely compares en- tities to point out their similarity, the metaphor at best "creates" a new awareness of an antecedently given but unnoticed com- monality. The metaphor would not create a new affinity between its relata, as current views of metaphor maintain. In the case of Kant's symbols, the rational concepts and empirical intuitions that they relate are radi- cally disjoint, precisely because such con- cepts cannot be directly exhibited in intu- ition at all. In terms of their appearance, "there is no similarity between a despotic state and a hand mill"; but even so, Kant writes, "there certainly is one between the rules by which we reflect on the two," and the analogy that relates them picks out this</page><page sequence="5">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 197 preexisting commonality (CJ, Ak. 352). The symbol is creative in keeping with the fact that symbolic exhibition is the work of the productive imagination active in reflective judgment in general (about which more later). Imagination's reflection makes ex- plicit an isomorphism in our thinking on hand mills and despotic states, and it forges a connection that enhances our understanding of despotism, but it works from pregiven conceptual rules. I will contrast this "weak" creativity of analogy making with the "strong" creativity attributed to metaphor by those who argue that metaphors establish original affinities between features of the world, rather than discovering pregiven ones.17 To anticipate: The other metaphor candidate in Kant's aesthetic theory, what he calls "aesthetic ideas," will enjoy both the strong creativity and the inexhaustibility of metaphorical meaning that recent theory has emphasized. The current vein of thought on metaphor to which I allude is known, across variations, as the interactionist theory. If Kant prefigures this way of understanding metaphor, rather than just drawing on the analogy tradition, the relevance of his aesthetic theory to con- temporary discussion will be more evident. Furthermore, we will be better positioned to assess (1) the sort of cognitive status meta- phor has in Kant's thought and (2) what the implications of that status might be. I shall provide a brief overview of current inter- actionist thinking on metaphor and then turn to the question of where in Kant's aes- thetics such thinking appears to be antici- pated. II. EXCURSUS ON THE INTERACTIONIST THEORY For purposes of a brief discussion, Max Black's seminal 1962 essay, "Metaphor," counts as the source of interactionism.18 The general way of conceiving metaphor is held by, for example, Nelson Goodman, Paul Riceour, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Eva Kittay, and Carl Hausman.19 A meta- phor sparks a semantic interaction when a concept is transferred from its customary do- main to an alien one. Black's metaphor "people are wolves" is literally false owing to its extension of the concept "wolf" to the human domain, but what gets transferred is a set of connotations that flesh out our under- standing of "wolf."20 The metaphor focuses our thoughts about people by invoking the "system of associated commonplaces" or the "implication-complex" we carry around about the ravenous, skittish, pack nature of wolves.2' The past connotations of the sec- ondary subject "wolf" are imposed in the metaphor on a primary subject, "people," the standard connotations of which both resist and invite the transference. In this transfer, as Goodman argues, "a set of terms, of alter- native labels, is transported; and the organi- zation they effect in the alien realm is guided by their habitual use in the home realm."22 By this means, metaphor promotes the reor- ganization of our patterns of discrimination, extending terms into new territory by form- ing novel links between previously unrelated phenomena. The process is "interactive" be- cause the primary subject influences what connotations of the secondary subject seem relevant, those connotations in turn spark a new consideration of the primary subject, and our understanding of even the second- ary subject is transformed through the in- vented isomorphism.23 Assuming we find some truth in the metaphor "people are wolves" (we may well not), our perspective on both people and wolves is transformed in the process. Hence a metaphor communicates broadly only if people share roughly the same conno- tations, about wolves, say. A Park Ranger with a special fondness for wolves might at- tribute a different meaning to the metaphor "people are wolves" than the one our shared commonplaces encourage. Or she or he might "get" the broadly shared meaning but insist the metaphor is false, and substitute "jackals" for "wolves." In any case, the valid- ity claim of a metaphor relies on its success in transferring connotations. Even so, this does not require that a metaphor mean just the same thing to everyone. The array of commonplaces a metaphor calls up for me may differ somewhat from yours; you may see an implication of it that others miss. This indicates that interactionist theory maintains the openness or inexhaustibility of meta-</page><page sequence="6">198 phorical meaning. Because metaphors juxta- pose disjoint and complex domains of con- notation, their meaning varies with the interpretive finesse of their audience, and so cannot be specified by any interpretive rule. One cannot claim that all and only these commonplaces must be transferred success- fully for a metaphor to mean. But neither does this make metaphorical meaning arbi- trary, for not just any commonplace can con- tribute to the transfer it affects. The meta- phor "people are wolves" does not usually highlight that humans have a keen sense of smell, much less that we mark our territory with certain eliminations. A successful meta- phor conveys a particular range of meaning in the array of relations it transfers, but it does not determine that meaning with final- ity, because the transfer varies across hearers and the set of relevant comparisons is in principle open to addition.24 Hence the cre- ation of metaphorical meaning is interactive in the added sense that both speaker and re- cipient of the metaphor contribute to its meaning. Interactionist theorists of metaphor em- phasize the extent to which metaphors serve to organize experience at fundamental lev- els. They orient perception, self-understand- ing, and action, and so the production of new metaphors always poses a challenge to the status quo of participants in a given world. Metaphors shape the network of connota- tions to which they appeal in their transfers; they can alter that network in remarkable ways when people find a transformation of their world compelling enough to validate and enact. Yet such claims for a metaphori- cal ordering of experience might suggest that metaphors determine our conceptions in sys- tematically complete forms, when in fact the openness and indeterminacy of metaphori- cal meaning must again be emphasized. Con- sider the notion of love, and the whole array of metaphors that structure some features of loving. "Love is a physical force," "love is a journey," "love is a patient," "love is mad- ness," "love is magic," and "love is war": all these metaphorical relations express some facets of the rich content of "love."25 Each set of relations captures some features of loving while ignoring others, but none can The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism capture the entirety. As a metaphorically structured concept, no final network of rela- tions can complete our conception of love in any exhaustive way. Each metaphor suggests that what falls under the concept "love" can only be understood in relation to something that falls outside the concept. Each meta- phor resists the closure of the concept by seeking beyond it for its meaning and each metaphor fulfills this search only partially, because it must choose among an array of connotative options. The interactionist conception, then, would have it that metaphor seeks through connec- tion and contrast to express a meaning literal wording cannot capture. Metaphor accom- plishes this by staging a collision between disparate experiential or semantic domains. It thereby achieves something that the or- dering of likenesses under concepts cannot: it illuminates widespread patterns of affinity that organize experience, often in powerful ways. A concept subsumes particulars under an abstract category that deemphasizes their differences; beanbag chairs and Barca- loungers share little but their function, though they fall under the same concept. But a metaphor relates things as different, while insisting on their uncanny affinity, however far-flung the connection. The price that met- aphor pays for what Riceour calls its "imper- tinence" is the indeterminacy of its mean- ing.26 The payoff comes in the form of the open-endedness of its potential meaning in the hands of varied interpreters and the re- markable structural connections across fields of experience metaphor can engender. Hence the point of a metaphor's (frequent) literal falsity: By claiming something is what it is not, a metaphor has the power, as Riceour writes, "to break an old categoriza- tion, in order to establish new logical fron- tiers on the ruins of their forerunners."27 Through this violation of current conven- tions for carving things up, metaphor "con- tributes to the epoche of ordinary reference and to the projection of new possibilities of redescribing the world."28 Earlier we encountered the issue of whether metaphors merely point out preex- isting but unnoticed similarities, as if they were merely acts of comparison, or if instead</page><page sequence="7">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 199 metaphors in some sense create the affinities they express. Interactionist theory embraces the strong creativity of metaphor lacking in the case of Kantian symbols.29 If metaphors produce new affinities between empirical en- tities, such as people and wolves, they in ef- fect ascribe new qualities to the subjects re- lated in the metaphor, in which case they transform our understanding of what those entities are. Contemporary interactionists defend the position that at least some meta- phors generate cognitive insights on the "real" world around us by performatively bringing into being the affinities they "dis- close." Black likens the productivity of meta- phor to the cognitive supplements provided us by new technologies. Before the invention of cinematography, the slow-motion appear- ance of a galloping horse did not exist. This addition to our visual equipment altered the world around us by adding incontestably real but previously nonexistent features to the world.30 Metaphor-as-new-technology is itself a metaphor for what metaphors do, and as with all metaphors on the interactionist view, it must transform, if accepted, our un- derstanding of the subjects it relates. In this case, the metaphor transforms our under- standing of what constitutes a world. Black is clear that the creativity of metaphors, their contribution of new insights on the world, makes sense so long as one understands that "the world is necessarily a world under a cer- tain description-or a world seen from a cer- tain perspective."31 If Kant's aesthetic theory prefigures the interactionist view of meta- phor, it will reflect in some way this convic- tion. III. METAPHOR AND AESTHETIC IDEAS If some scholars have discerned an anal- ogy-based account of metaphor in Kant's theory of the symbol, several have also found traces of metaphoricity in what he calls "aes- thetic ideas."32 They are the subject of section 49 of the third Critique, where Kant argues that "spirit," "the animating [aesthetic] prin- ciple in the mind," is the ability to produce them (CJ, Ak. 313). Kant's initial definition poses the aesthetic idea as the "counterpart" of the rational idea. A rational idea, as we have seen, is "a concept to which no intuition (presentation of the imagination) can be ade- quate" (CJ, Ak. 314); hence it can only be ex- hibited indirectly by analogy. An aesthetic idea, conversely, is "a presentation of the imagination which prompts much thought, but to which no determinate thought whatso- ever, i.e., no [determinate] concept, can be adequate, so that no language can express it completely and allow us to grasp it" (ibid.).33 While the object of a rational idea (e.g., un- conditioned freedom) cannot be met with di- rectly in experience, its meaning is given a priori by reason, and its significance can be fleshed out by means of analogy in symbols. An aesthetic idea, on the other hand, is imag- inatively produced in experience, but its meaning cannot be determinately or deci- sively specified in concepts. It "prompts ... so much thought as can never be compre- hended with a determinate concept" (CJ, Ak. 315). This already suggests that aesthetic ideas enjoy the inexhaustibility of meaning that interactionist theory attributes to meta- phor. The task now is to take a closer look at how aesthetic ideas work, in order to sub- stantiate the claim that they are metaphors on an interactionist reading. Kant characterizes the aesthetic idea more specifically as a presentation of the imagina- tion that spurs an open-ended reflection on the meaning of some given concept. This presentation "aesthetically expands the con- cept in an unlimited way," and this expansion amounts to "expressing the concept's impli- cations and its kinship with other concepts" (ibid.). Kant names these expanded "impli- cations" of the original concept its aesthetic attributes, to distinguish them from the "logi- cal" attributes contained in the pregiven content or meaning of the concept. His pri- mary example (as is so often the case with Kant) is only so helpful: Thus Jupiter's eagle with the lightning in its claws is an attribute of the mighty king of heaven, and the peacock is an attribute of heaven's stately queen. [Through] these attributes, unlike [through] logical attributes, [we] do not present the content of our concepts of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but present something differ- ent, something that prompts the imagination to</page><page sequence="8">200 spread over a multitude of kindred presentations that arouse more thought than can be expressed in a concept determined by words. (ibid.)34 An image of an eagle grasping lightning bolts, a conventional symbol (not in Kant's sense) for Jupiter, is an aesthetic attribute at- taching to the concept of creation's majesty. Such attributes "yield an aesthetic idea" when they prompt the imagination "to spread over a multitude of kindred presenta- tions," the whole of which "serves the mentioned rational idea as a substitute for a logical exhibition" (ibid.). Kant's charac- terization is confusing, because it makes am- biguous whether the aesthetic idea is just the original presentation or instead the outcome of an expansive reflection on that presenta- tion. In one sense the aesthetic idea here is the image of the lightning-wielding eagle that prompts the aesthetic expansion of the idea of a majestic creation. But Kant indi- cates that the presentation of such attributes yields an aesthetic idea, which suggests that instead the aesthetic idea is the aesthetically expanded idea of majesty resulting from the reflection that the eagle-image prompts. The latter alternative makes more sense of an ambiguous text, especially since the eagle- image would not on its own seem to count as an idea at all, whereas the majestic-cre- ation-idea-expanded-through-an-array-of- aesthetic-attributes would. On this reading, then, an aesthetic idea is a concept aestheti- cally expanded "in an unlimited way" by bringing its "implications and its kinships with other concepts" to bear on its rich meaning. It may be that the eagle-image prompts this concept-expanding reflection; that is, the eagle-image may be the original "presentation of imagination" that gets re- flection on the concept going. The fulfilled aesthetic idea, however, is the new, aestheti- cally inflected notion of an "eaglish" majesty of creation, now enriched with images, asso- ciations, implications, and kinships with other features of experience and the icono- graphic tradition. Identifying the aesthetic idea in this way is important because it makes clear that both creator and recipient of the presentation play vital roles in unfolding its rich meaning. The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism The ingenious creator of aesthetic ideas links disparate images and ideas into relationships pregnant with connotations for another to interpret. But when an aesthetic idea in- spires the expansion of a concept into "a multitude of kindred presentations," this ex- pansion occurs in the interpretive play of its hearers, such that thoroughly constituting the aesthetic idea is a shared endeavor. The ambiguity in Kant's presentation allows one to locate the aesthetic idea as either a sug- gestive presentation or the rich complex of response to its suggestiveness, but really the aesthetic idea is only fulfilled through both of these dimensions. And this, of course, is true for metaphors on the interactionist view. Metaphorical meaning is created through a relationship between author and "reader" of a metaphor, and aesthetic ideas share this "interactive" genesis. As indicated earlier, the interactionist the- ory holds that metaphors are "interactive" in the more specific sense of staging a sugges- tive coordination and tension between the terms of the metaphor itself. This is precisely what occurs in the aesthetic expansion of a concept brought on by its being creatively connected to some image or idea that trans- forms its significance. For this reason one can characterize the aesthetic idea as a meta- phorically enriched concept (as "love" was in the previous section). Consider Kant's clear- est statement of what an aesthetic idea is, ap- plied to a second example: In a word, an aesthetic idea is a presentation of the imagination which is conjoined with a given concept and is connected, when we use imagina- tion in its freedom, with such a multiplicity of par- tial presentations that no expression that stands for a determinate concept can be found for it. Hence it is a presentation that makes us add to a concept the thoughts of much that is ineffable, but the feeling of which quickens our cognitive pow- ers and connects language, which otherwise would be mere letters, with spirit. (CJ, Ak. 316) Suppose the original "concept," or as Black would say, the "primary subject," is Juliet, and the presentation that imagination makes regarding it is "Juliet is the sun." This presen- tation spurs a free imaginative reflection on</page><page sequence="9">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 201 "kindred presentations" that express "the concept's implications and its kinship with other concepts." That is, we interpret the metaphor to mean a great variety of things: Juliet gives life to Romeo; he cannot live without her; she makes everything visible to him in a fresh light; she is the center of his universe; he is perhaps endangering himself by making her the center of his universe, since the sun is only falsely conceived as the universe's center, and you can, after all, get burned by it, etc. This reflection expands the concept "in an unlimited way" because the metaphorical enrichment of it is open- ended; there is no point at which we could claim categorically to have exhausted its meaning. The outcome of this process, the fulfilled aesthetic idea "Juliet-the-sun," rep- resents an open-ended transference of at- tributes onto Juliet from the domain of solar "commonplaces" or "entailments," or fea- tures of the "sun" semantic field, as this or that interactionist theorist of metaphor would have it.35 The interaction among things related through the aesthetic idea af- fects a new understanding of Juliet, a new ap- preciation of her meaning for Romeo, and even a deeper understanding of the sun on whose energy we depend even more than love's. In sum, the suspicion of several com- mentators that Kant's aesthetic ideas are metaphors is confirmed by the fact that Kant's very account of how they operate ac- cords with the contemporary interactionist perspective on metaphorical expression and meaning. Aesthetic ideas share with metaphor as currently conceived an inexhaustibility of meaning. The expansive reflection that ac- companies aesthetic ideas, i.e., the open- ended unfolding of connotations in meta- phor, is incompatible with the view that their meaning could be reduced to a literal para- phrase or brought to any determinate com- pletion. Aesthetic ideas, as Kant emphasizes, make us think more "than can be compre- hended within one concept and hence in one determinate linguistic expression" (CJ, Ak. 315). For this reason, aesthetic ideas must be carefully distinguished from Kantian sym- bols, for a number of commentators have at- tributed, incorrectly I believe, a symbolic function to aesthetic ideas.36 The meaning of an aesthetic idea is not specified by an ana- logical rule, and so it cannot strictly speaking have a symbolic function in Kant's sense of the term.37 When the concept that an aes- thetic idea expands is a rational idea, the aes- thetic idea may be said to express its implica- tions and the like. Jupiter's eagle is such a case, and Kant finds other examples of this in the poetic arts, where the artist "ventures to give sensible expression to rational ideas of invisible beings, the realm of the blessed, the realm of hell, eternity, creation, and so on" (CJ, Ak. 314; he seems to have Dante in mind). Even so, aesthetic ideas are not struc- tured as analogies, and hence they do not ex- hibit rational ideas (or anything else) sym- bolically. The view that they are so structured undermines the inexhaustibility of meaning unique to aesthetic ideas, since Kantian symbols do not enjoy this open- endedness. Treating aesthetic ideas as having a symbolic, analogical function confuses the two competing conceptions of metaphor in Kant's aesthetic theory. Hence it obscures the prefigurative "interactionist" insights of Kant's notion of the aesthetic idea, given the limitations of the analogy tradition of con- ceiving metaphor.38 Further, the view that aesthetic ideas are symbolic runs into problems because, strictly speaking, Kantian symbols are of use exclu- sively in indirectly exhibiting directly indemonstrable ideas of reason, whereas aesthetic ideas have a much broader role to play. Kant indicates that in addition to ex- pressing rational ideas, aesthetic ideas may express "[things] that are indeed exemplified in experience, such as death, envy, and all the other vices, as well as love, fame, and so on" (ibid.). In such cases, aesthetic ideas do "em- ulate the example of reason" by attempting to illuminate these topics with a richness "that goes beyond the limits of experience." This going-beyond does not, however, mean aesthetic ideas always make symbolic refer- ence to ideas of reason. Rather, the expan- sive reflection they induce, by relating dispa- rate domains of experience, enjoys a richness in excess of what isolated experiences offer. Indeed, the literal falsity of a metaphor such as "Juliet is the sun" already "goes beyond"</page><page sequence="10">202 everyday experience, in which Juliet is cer- tainly not the sun, in search of a richer ex- pression and communication of meaning.39 Aesthetic ideas must play a broader ex- pressive role than analogical symbols, be- cause in fact they are, in Kant's aesthetic the- ory, the expressed content of works of art. Kant defines artistic genius as "a talent for producing something for which no determi- nate rule can be given . . . " (CJ, Ak. 307). Such an "unruly" talent might produce noth- ing but "original nonsense" were it not allied with the spirit for communication that pres- ents aesthetic ideas. Genius creates in art a presentation "for which an adequate con- cept can never be found," which means that the artistic meanings housed in aesthetic ideas invite an open-ended and inexhaust- ible locus of interpretation for a work's audi- ence.40 Art shares with metaphor this invita- tion to an unlimited elaboration of meaning, and of course many contemporary philoso- phers of art theorize artistic expression as deeply metaphorical in structure.41 On such a view a creative metaphor counts as a min- iature work of art in its own right; like all art worth the name, it brings together disjoint materials to express a new perspective that transforms our understanding of ourselves and our world. Works of art have this power, in Kant's aesthetic theory, because they ex- press through metaphor in the interactionist sense. If there are two conceptions of meta- phor to be found in Kant's aesthetics, the ac- count evident in his notion of the aesthetic idea takes pride of place at the center of his philosophy of art. I noted earlier that the "metaphorical" di- mension of Kant's theory of symbolism dif- fers with interactionism on both the creativ- ity of metaphor and the inexhaustibility of its meaning. The meaning of a Kantian sym- bol is fixed by an analogical rule, and it cre- ates only in the weak sense of bringing pregiven but unnoticed commonalities to light. Kant's theory of the aesthetic idea, on the other hand, models metaphor as both in- exhaustible (not replaceable by a literal paraphrase, or as Kant would say, by a "con- cept determined by words") and signifi- cantly creative. Aesthetic ideas are the prod- uct of an imagination that is, as Kant writes, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism "very mighty when it creates, as it were, an- other nature out of the material that actual nature gives it" (CJ, Ak. 314). Imagination can, through the metaphorical means of aes- thetic ideas, "restructure experience" and can "process [the material that nature lends it] into something quite different ... that sur- passes nature" (ibid.). The productive imagi- nation responsible for metaphor is "free," Kant claims, "from the law of association (which attaches to the empirical use of the imagination)" (ibid.). Noticing antecedently given similarities would be the work of em- pirical association, but we have seen that metaphor on the interactionist view invents new affinities between domains of experi- ence. It thereby transforms our understand- ing of the features of the world that the met- aphor relates. If we maintain Black's conviction that a "world" is always a "world under a certain description," then the cre- ativity of metaphors (at least those we em- brace) transforms the relata themselves. In the context of Kant's thought, a productive imagination, through the invention of a "second nature" in aesthetic ideas, would be the agent of that transformation. Rudolf Makkreel has argued that the Kantian subject creates aesthetic ideas in order to make sense of experience and the world as a coherent whole.42 If this is correct, then the invention of aesthetic ideas would be the Kantian subject's principal means for achieving the creative reconstruals of experi- ence that interactionism situates in the pro- duction of metaphorical meaning. Our inter- pretive perspectives on the world, and the world conveyed through those perspectives, would then be deeply structured in meta- phorical terms, as interactionist theorists would maintain. Some features of the world are made through metaphor, and so meta- phor makes an indispensable cognitive con- tribution to a broad conception of human understanding construed, by Goodman, for one, as "worldmaking." In a strong sense, our perspectives count as creative works of art (second nature), and the world embodied by our perspectives is a product of artistic en- deavor. This will perhaps not sound terribly Kantian to some readers, but the claim can be rephrased in Kantian terms-at least to a</page><page sequence="11">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 203 certain extent, as we will see. To understand what cognitive status creative metaphors may have in Kant's thought, we need to delve more deeply into the intersubjective validity Kant accords to these inventions of productive imagination. We will find that, for Kant, metaphor ultimately gets its cognitive legitimacy from the same transcendental source as "literal" conceptual knowledge. IV. THE COGNITIVE STATUS OF METAPHOR FOR KANT We have seen that there are two conceptions of metaphor to be gleaned from Kant's aes- thetic theory. One construes metaphor in terms of analogy, harking back to Aristotle: It grants metaphor only a weakly creative di- mension and limits metaphorical meaning in accordance with an analogical rule. "Meta- phors" of this sort play a crucial role in giving intuitive embodiment to reason's ideas, espe- cially in the moral sphere. The other can be found in Kant's notion of the aesthetic idea: it grants metaphor the potential for the strong creativity as well as the inexhaustibility of meaning that is emphasized by contempo- rary interactionist views. Aesthetic ideas as metaphors form the core of artistic expres- sion and lend a metaphorizing dimension to the broader sense-making aims of the human subject. What status would each of these con- ceptions grant to metaphor on Kant's view of cognition? Given the central role that the creative (in the weak or strong sense) disclosure of affin- ities plays in both kinds of Kantian meta- phor, investigating the transcendental status of affinity will clarify the validity claim of metaphorical sense-making. It happens that Kant elaborates on affinity as a transcenden- tal condition of all experience in the "A" edi- tion Deduction of the first Critique.43 One of Kant's primary aims there is to establish a firm foundation for empirical knowledge by determining "the a priori conditions on which the possibility of experience de- pends"; these conditions will give experience an immutable form that structures our knowledge of appearances. Accounting for this structure explains how it is possible that "cognition is a whole consisting of compared and connected presentations," connected as a whole by virtue of the universal applicabil- ity of that form to all appearances. In the "A" Deduction, Kant finds an explanation for this experiential unity in his doctrine of a "threefold synthesis" consisting of "the syn- thesis of the apprehension of presentations that are modifications of the mind in intu- ition; the synthesis of the reproduction of these presentations in imagination; and the synthesis of their recognition in the concept" (CPR A96, 97). The initial synthesis of apprehension "goes through and gathers together" the manifold as intuited spatially and temporally, while the final synthesis of recognition in concepts or- ganizes presentations under categories that dictate the form of appearance. But Kant thinks that prior to the synthesis of recogni- tion "we must assume a pure transcendental synthesis of imagination that itself underlies the possibility of all experience"; this synthe- sis of reproduction grounds the possibility of presentations being relatable as such, that is, grounds their reproducibility in orderly ways (CPR A101). The imaginative maintenance of the temporal field of presentations allows temporally separate presentations to be gathered and compared. Only if presenta- tions are a priori relatable can the synthesis of recognition organize them under catego- ries. Rules of understanding " [present], when appearances are given to us, the necessary re- production of their manifold," but a produc- tive imagination grounds their original be- longing together: "The principle of the necessary unity of the imagination's pure (productive) synthesis prior to apperception is the basis for the possibility of all cognition, especially of experience" (CPR A106, 118). For Kant, at least in the "A" Deduction, pro- ductive imagination-which in another con- text creates the open-ended richness of aes- thetic ideas-makes possible the very application of understanding's categories to the manifold. It accomplishes this by first constituting that manifold as a continuous field amenable to determinate conceptual structuration. Kant asks in this account of the preconceptual work of productive imagina- tion how particular instances of empirical as-</page><page sequence="12">204 sociation are possible. He answers, "The basis for the possibility of the manifold's as- sociation, insofar as this basis lies in the ob- ject, is called the manifold's affinity" (CPR A113). Affinity is the indeterminate relatability of the manifold: it grounds the possibility of rule-governed connections be- tween appearances and it is produced prior to rule-determination under categories. The manifold of this affinity will be determined in the end by conceptual rules, and Kant con- cludes, "the affinity of all appearances (whether near or remote) is a necessary con- sequence of a synthesis in imagination that is based a priori on rules" (CPR A123).44 Imagination's synthetic work will be deter- mined conceptually by what the synthesis of recognition in concepts and the work of un- derstanding contribute to the construction of objectively valid knowledge. But in an aes- thetic context, imagination plays with its pro- ductive powers independently of conceptual determination. In lieu of cognizing its object through the understanding's rules, aesthetic imagination "reverts," as it were, to the prod- uct of its prior moment of synthesis, namely, the relatability of the whole. Put another way, imagination reflects aesthetically on what the extent of its synthetic powers, when free of rule determination, allow it to. That is, imagination explores the indeterminate af- finity of the manifold. When productive imagination plays aes- thetically, it celebrates the differential, unde- termined affinity it "finds" in its presenta- tions despite the absence of ordering concepts. Imagination celebrates the inter- connectedness of all presentations, their fun- damental and mutual affinity, and in meta- phorical expression realizes this affinity in instances of uncanny relation. In the process, and most importantly for us, imagination dis- closes the affinity of the manifold to be the aesthetic condition of all conceptual cogni- tion. Only if imagination provides an affin- ity-limned whole to conceptual thinking can elements of that whole be ordered in the manner specific to subsumption under con- cepts. This conclusion is, in a sense, just a re- statement in terms of the first Critique of Kant's third Critique tenet that the free, The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism preconceptual accord of imagination and un- derstanding in aesthetic experience is the condition of possibility for the conceptually determinate experience in which under- standing legislates to imagination. But the status of affinity as a transcendental condi- tion of cognition reveals the sort of end run metaphor does around concepts in order to claim its validity. For Kant, the disclosure of affinity in metaphor gains its objective valid- ity from the same preconceptual transcen- dental starting point as knowledge amenable to literal statement. This much holds true for both conceptions of metaphor I have recovered from Kant, but the respective implications of their ap- peals to this transcendental basis differ greatly. In the case of Kantian symbols, one of the relata whose affinity is disclosed through analogy is a rational idea. These "metaphors" help the Kantian subject think about supersensibles that cannot be directly cognized in experience. The analogy through which we think God as author of the world motivates the reflective search for the unity and the coherence among physical laws that the natural world would presumably display were it a product of intelligence. The analogy that relates the free productivity of norms in aesthetic experience to the enactment of freedom in the moral sphere helps convey the third Critique message that for all its mechanism, nature might have room in it for practical autonomy. These "metaphors" gain their normativity not only from the transcen- dental status of affinity, but from the tran- scendental pedigree of the rational ideas they symbolize. Such ideas are common to the "thought-range" of all rational subjects, and as the finest fruits of reason Kant thinks they are enjoined upon us to think. Recall that the analogy underlying a Kantian sym- bol discloses a similarity between (1) the rule under which we think some idea of reason and (2) the conceptual rule through which we cognize a class of empirical objects or ex- periences. It may be that more than one em- pirical intuition could serve to symbolize the idea. Something other than the hand mill could symbolize despotism, but only so long as its concept shared the same rule-governed</page><page sequence="13">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 205 isomorphism with our idea of despotism as our thought on the hand-mill intuition does. Hence metaphors of this kind have a secure claim to universal validity, within Kant's thought, given their reference to a transcen- dental relatum, although which intuition makes for the best symbol of that relatum might vary across cultural contexts. Because Kantian symbols refer to rational ideas, they have little bearing on cognition of the empirical world. In keeping with this, they do not transform our understanding of the empirical intuition deployed as symbol, because the conceptual rule through which we think the symbol is not altered by being compared analogously to our reflection on a rational idea. These "metaphors" are not creative in the strong sense, but only in the weak sense of pointing out a previously un- noticed, preexisting similarity. The stakes change dramatically when we turn to the view on metaphor embodied in Kant's aes- thetic idea, for these metaphors relate em- pirical particulars (people and wolves, say) and so are deprived of the universal validity assured by the symbol's supersensible refer- ence. Given that, on the interactionist view, metaphorical communication exploits shared connotations about one dimension of experience in order to transform under- standing of another, such connotations must first be shared before metaphors can mean. This assures that their cognitive significance will be localized to "communities" of shared background understanding, however great or small those communities may be.45 In other words, the role a priori affinity plays in giving metaphor-making a transcendental le- gitimation cannot account for the empirical question of why some metaphorical products of imaginative connection "work" and some do not. Transcendental affinity can account, on Kant's view of cognition, for the very pos- sibility of metaphor, but it alone cannot ex- plain why "time is money" works and "ched- dar is money" does not (any more than the categories can account for why I am experi- encing this object, this keyboard, right now). Transcendental affinity ultimately provides only a "formal" measure of the precon- ceptual basis to which metaphorical inven- tion appeals. Put another way, transcenden- tal affinity justifies the practice of inventing sense-making patterns through metaphor, but it alone offers no guidelines for which products of this practice will receive an intersubjectively shared validation. The key issue in assessing the cognitive status of the Kantian metaphors embodied in aesthetic ideas is their strong creativity. On the interactionist view, powerful meta- phors create affinities between components of experience and the world, transform our understanding of those features, and hence transform the world sculpted through our metaphor-inflected perspectives on it. Meta- phor does not merely compare the furniture of our worlds; it helps to craft it. If this is true of Kant's aesthetic ideas, it will be so because they relate disjoint empirical entities, and transform what we make of them, rather than referring an intuition to a rational idea, as his symbols do. As the philosopher of the Copernican Revolution, Kant embraced the idea that human subjectivity gives the empir- ical world ("the totality of possible objects of experience"46) a human shape. The world is the way we "find" it owing to a productive synthesis under the categories, along with the various "axioms," "anticipations," "anal- ogies," and "postulates," that Kant thinks at- tend upon that synthesis. This transcendental act of "worldmaking" is a far cry, however, from the artistic creation of metaphors that purport to transform the empirical world in midstream, as it were. Whether Kant would embrace the strong creativity thesis of interactionism hangs, then, on whether he would extend the transcendental spontaneity of the human mind into the cognition of em- pirical particulars. It is the productive imagi- nation of Kant's aesthetic theory that dis- plays the creative spontaneity in question, and so ultimately the issue comes down to whether Kant would accept an aesthetically reflective dimension to cognition of the world. In a strict sense, we could conclude that the imaginative aesthetic act of inventing metaphor cannot count as cognition for Kant, which on his first Critique terms re- quires schematized rule determination</page><page sequence="14">206 under the categories. Alternatively, we might take seriously the enriched conception of the human subject Kant presents in the Critique of Judgment. Kant grants this aesthetically active subject new powers to imaginatively elaborate the significance of experience and the world as a whole by means of the twin routes of symbolization and expression (which originate the two views on metaphor Kant provides). Aesthetic ideas in particular, in the expressive media of metaphor and art, allow us to interpret and recast our under- standings of the world, which surely counts as a cognitive mission given a broader con- ception of human understanding than Kant's. In the spirit of Goodman's pragma- tism, understanding involves the myriad ways we sort and compose, weigh and order the furniture of the worlds that we make by such means, all of which reflects our practical engagement with those worlds, all of which deeply involves metaphor. Kant perhaps comes close to this more generous conception of cognition at one point in the Critique of Judgment, when he grants that it may be permissible to call a way of construing our experience cognition "if this cognition is a principle not for deter- mining the object theoretically, as to what it is in itself, but for determining it practically, as to what the idea of the object ought to be- come for us and for our purposive employ- ment of it . . . " (CJ, Ak. 353). Kant likely means this to refer to his conception of prac- tical moral cognition, so we cannot make too much of the passage. If he might balk at the notion of an aesthetically and pragmatically inflected metaphorical cognition of the world, I think we can say who (other than contemporary interactionists) would not. Max Black makes it clear that his conception of metaphor is influenced by the early twen- tieth-century work of the literary critic I. A. Richards.47 Richards, in turn, developed his take on metaphor in the context of, among other things, analyzing the work of the Ro- mantic poets.48 Coleridge and Wordsworth in particular, as is well known, borrowed their idea of an artistically ingenious, pro- ductive imagination from Kant's aesthetic theory. Hence there is in fact a genealogy to be written of the literal origins of The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism interactionism in Kant. Most significant at present, however, is the fact that this tradi- tion passes not only through the Romantic poets, but deep into the aesthetic concerns of post-Kantian German intellectual culture, most importantly represented (at first) by Schiller and Schelling. Their embrace of an aesthetic dimension for human understand- ing is lovingly tight, and in the case of Schelling's System of Transcendental Ideal- ism there is no question that the imaginative spontaneity of human understanding has ex- tended into the interpretive crafting of em- pirical particularity. Thirteen years after the publication of the Critique of Judgment, a certain G. W. F Hegel will declare, in his and Schelling's Critical Journal of 1803, "The [productive] imagination is nothing but Rea- son itself . .. [though] it is only reason as it appears in the sphere of empirical conscious- ness."49 Hegelian reason will be the sine qua non of the spontaneous crafting of the order of things, and his system will be the greatest extension of basic insights of Kant's third Critique.50 If Kant might balk at the notion of a metaphorically enriched and construc- tive cognition of the world, contemporary interactionist conceptions of metaphor are heirs to the thought of Kant's "idealist" pu- pils who pushed Kant's aesthetic insights to this conclusion. The powers Kant grants imagination in the third Critique, as an active, artistic "construer" of the world through metaphor, suggest that Kant's aesthetic theory requires us to reconsider his conception of cognition. We have seen that metaphor for Kant gets its validity from the same precognitive source from which objective cognition arises. This result heightens the urgency of this need. In the meantime we might accept the "equiprimordial" legitimacy of aesthetic and cognitive advancements of understanding, as interactionist theorists of metaphor would have us do. Hobbes and Locke, and most of the tradition they reflect (before and after), would want to reassert the hierarchy of con- ceptual cognition over metaphorical play that Kant can be seen (or can be made) to question, if not resolve, at its root. It would be unwise to share with Hobbes and com- pany that all-too-familiar desire.51</page><page sequence="15">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 207 KIRK E.

Proportional analogy will be the basis below for both Kantian symbols and Aristotle's account of some metaphors. 7. See G.

Anthropomorphism is the mistake of imagining that symbolic exhibition of an idea (as in the God-as-watchmaker analogy) provides us determinate knowledge of a divine being's nature. It amounts to a confusion of schematic and symbolic forms of concept illustration. Cf. CJ, Ak. 353 and 457. 10.

Nuyen has argued the same position, but without making any reference to the role of analogy in the symbol; see "The Kantian Theory of Metaphor," Philosophy and Rhetoric 22 (1989): 95-109. Kantian symbols cannot be understood apart from their analogical function; neglecting this leads Nuyen to obscure the difference between symbols and what Kant calls "aesthetic ideas," in which analogy does not play a central role.

This claim is not compatible, however, with the analogical, comparison-making form of Kant's sym- bol, and, as noted above, Nuyen neglects to mention analogy in his interpretation of Kant. A Kantian symbol draws an analogy between concepts based on the al- ready given similarity in the rules governing their mean- ings and applications. Indeed, Nuyen acknowledges, "Some part of the literal meaning of a term (i.e., its rules or logical form) must feature the similarity or resem- blance created by the Judgment as the basis for connect- ing the rational concept with that term" (p. 98). This in- dicates that the symbol-making (analogical) judgment precisely does not create the similarity between concep- tual rules; it only draws on and makes use of it to concretize a rational idea. 18.

Myself included: My position on this issue repre- sents a rethinking of views I presented in "Form and Content in Kant's Aesthetics: Situating Beauty and the Sublime in the Work of Art," The Journal of the History of Philosophy 32 (1994): 443-459. This adjustment does not harm the broader argument of that essay, for which the claim that aesthetic ideas sometimes express ratio- nal ideas does just as well as the claim that aesthetic ideas symbolize them. For other statements of the view that aesthetic ideas symbolize rational ideas, see Coleman, who claims that aesthetic ideas are "examples of analogical reasoning" (The Harmony of Reason, p. 161), and Makkreel, who argues the complex position that Kantian symbols are expressions of aesthetic ideas; see Imagination and Interpretation in Kant, pp. 122-128. The position seems inconsistent with the strictly analog- ical function of the symbol. Makkreel's claim that "the expression of an aesthetic idea . . . can provide a sym- bolic analogue" (p. 128) for a rational idea appears to be at odds with the quite "disanalogical" functioning of aesthetic ideas. 37. It should be noted that Kant does mention anal- ogy once in his discussion of aesthetic ideas (Ak. 314), but each of his several explanations of how aesthetic ideas work, each of which constitutes a sort of variation on the theme, makes no mention of analogy and does not accord with Kant's account of symbolic exhibition (?59). 38. Nuyen's thesis that aesthetic attributes symbolize rational concepts ("The Kantian Theory of Metaphor," pp. 101-103) indicates once again that Nuyen confuses the difference between aesthetic ideas and symbols by overlooking, as noted above, the central role of analogy in the latter and its absence in the former. Nuyen's broad claim is that the same mechanism is at work in both symbols and aesthetic ideas (p. 95), when in fact the mechanism at work in Kantian symbols (i.e., anal- ogy, which goes unrecognized by Nuyen) is not only not central to aesthetic ideas, but would strip aesthetic ideas of the strong creativity Nuyen wants to claim for them, if it were central to them. Nuyen makes roughly "interactionist" claims for the metaphorical nature of aesthetic ideas while confusing their operation with a Kantian account of the symbol, which, when one recog- nizes its basis in analogy, is at odds with the inexhaustibility and strong creativity of the inter- actionist conception of metaphor embodied in Kant's aesthetic idea. 39. Makkreel puts the difference this way: "Rational ideas transcend nature, [while] aesthetic ideas surpass it by transforming and enriching experience" (Imagina- tion and Interpretation in Kant, p. 120). 40. This would not be the case if art generally con- veyed meaning via symbolic exhibition by analogy. In- deed, artforms that admittedly do rely heavily on ana- logical means, such as parables, fall notably short of the expressive richness Kant expects from the art of genius. 41. See, for example, Goodman, Languages of Art, chap. 2, and Arthur Danto, The Transfiguration of the Commonplace (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981), chap. 7. Hausman proposes a theory of art as met- aphor, in the interactionist vein, in Metaphor and Art, esp. chaps. 4 and 5.</page><page sequence="17">Pillow Jupiter's Eagle and the Despot's Hand Mill 209 42. Imagination and Interpretation in Kant, pp. 118-129. Nuyen makes similar claims about the cogni- tive value of metaphor for Kant, "The Kantian Theory of Metaphor," pp. 105-108. The following section pro- vides a more Kant-internal attempt to substantiate such claims than Nuyen offers. 43. The following pages offer only a brief and com- pressed look at the "A" edition Deduction for the pur- pose of clarifying the transcendental basis of the meta- phor-making work of productive imagination. I do not aim to provide a thorough consideration of Kant's argu- ments, their merits, or the way they evolved in the "B" Deduction. It should be noted, however, that Kant's dis- cussion of affinity in the "A" Deduction does not appear in the later version. Given the significance that tran- scendental affinity will grant to the synthetic power of a preconceptual productive imagination, this revision may reflect the "retreat" from transcendental imagina- tion Heidegger detects in Kant's "B" edition. Curiously, despite the centrality of transcendental affinity to imag- ination's a priori productivity, Heidegger never dis- cusses it. Cf. Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, 4th ed., trans. Richard Taft (Indiana University Press, 1990), esp. ??17 and 31. 44. "Whether near or remote": if empirical concepts subsume particulars "near" to each other under abstract categories (e.g., kindred varieties of dog under the con- cept "dog"), metaphors relate "remote" features of the world (e.g., love and war) into a striking and uncanny af- finity. 45. Hence, West Coast high technology workers who convey that they cannot expend time or attention on some issue by saying "I don't have the disk space for that" should not expect that this will communicate their meaning effectively to everyone. Thanks to Amy Binder and Tim Self for the example. 46. Kant defines nature in this way in the Prolegom- ena; cf. ??16-17. 47. Black, "More About Metaphor," p. 27. 48.

Hegel's position on metaphor, however, is quite complex and beyond the scope of this essay. 51.
