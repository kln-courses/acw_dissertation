INTRODUCTION It is widely accepted that the complexities of hominid social life are respons- ible for the evolution of distinctively human mental capacities. Certainly one distinctive feature of human intelligence is social intelligence, and this is often expressed as the idea that we are 'mind-readers', able to develop an intentional profile of other agents in the course of explaining and predicting their behaviour.' Mind-reading and the capacity to negotiate the social world are not the same thing, but the former seems to be necessary for the latter: people with autism are extremely restricted in their comprehension of mental states and they have comparable difficulties in negotiating the social world. And no wonder: while not every social fact is a mental fact, and not every social property definable in mentalistic terms, our basic grip on the social world depends on our being able to see our fellows as motivated by beliefs and desires we sometimes share and sometimes do not. Social institutions are, then, intelligible as (imperfect) devices for harnessing the agreement and resolving the conflict. So it is no surprise that in evolutionary and developmental theories of social intelligence the primary focus has been on our capacity for detecting, thinking about and responding to the mental states of conspecifics, particularly with a view to co-operating and/or com- peting with them. Clearly such social understanding is deeply and almost 'R. Byrne and A.

It is that subdomain of social understanding which concerns us here. Is our mind-reading capacity a modular capacity? The question is inter- esting for several reasons. One of them is this. Mind-reading is a cognitive rather than a perceptual ability. It is not controversial that important aspects of perception are modular; they are subserved by dedicated, specialized and perhaps even informationally autonomous mechanisms. But the suggestion that belief fixation might be modular is controversial. Developing an inten- tional profile is further removed from immediate perception than are the paradigms of modular cognition. So this is a good case for testing the hypo- thesis that there are cognitive modules. We deny the strong claim that there is a modular central system wherein the fixation of social belief takes place. But our doubts are not based on any general animosity towards the idea of modularity in the design of human beings; we think the mind is probably full of modules. We think a somewhat less ambitious hypothesis about the modularity of social intelligence is plaus- ible. We argue that social intelligence exhibits a mix of modular and non- modular aspects. This hybrid character cannot be explained on a strong, centralist version of the modularity hypothesis, but it falls naturally out of the picture we suggest. II. FODORIAN MODULARITY It is very common for people who advocate the modularity of social intel- ligence to represent themselves as revising in some fundamental way Fodor's picture of mental architecture.2 A common observation is that Fodor 'did not go far enough', because he did not recognize that central belief fixing systems can be modular, and that excellent evidence for this is to be found in the domain of social intelligence. Jackendoff, for example, argues that 'there is a module or group of modules (a faculty) that is specialized for social cognition', and he remarks that this is contrary to Fodor's view: 'Fodor, for instance, specifically denies that modularity applies to thought as well as to perception'.3 And Gigerenzer says 'I disagree with Fodor's 2 J.

Shallice, From NJeuropsychology to Mental Structure (Cambridge UP, 1988), ch. 12, for a different approach to reconsidering Fodor's ban on central modules. Fodor himself has suggested that knowledge of folk psychology is innate, which is a quite dif- ferent claim from the claim that it is modular: see his Psychosemantics (MIT Press, 1987), p. I32. ?

Social intelligence involves both perceptual pro- cesses and mechanisms for reasoning and inductive inference.'4 In order to see what this commits advocates of the modularity of social intelligence to, we should remind ourselves of Fodor's picture of mental architecture. In The Modularity of Mind Fodor argues that cognitive systems come in two kinds. Systems of the first kind are domain-specific: they answer questions from a restricted area. Such systems are often, Fodor suggests, encapsulated: in dealing with their thus restricted domains they draw on a narrow and proprietary range of information. In certain specific cases there may be information flow between modules. My visual system imports information about my head- and eye-movements, and thus discriminates changes in the retinal image caused by these movements from changes produced by exter- nal causes. But in their processing they are not susceptible to influence by information from higher levels, levels at or above that at which they deliver outputs. This specific form of encapsulation is sometimes called 'cognitive impenetrability': what we want or believe makes no difference to how the module works. The actual cognitive systems Fodor identifies as encapsulated are the 'in- put systems', those that interpret transduced information and make it avail- able for central processing.5 And the input systems are, he says, perceptual systems plus language processing. These are Fodor's modules. And they are characterized not just by being domain-specific and encapsulated. They are fast; they are independent of voluntary control; they are relatively in- accessible to central systems not just in their informational encapsulation but also in being opaque to introspection; the representations they compute are relatively shallow; they are innately specified and have a fixed neural architecture; they are subject to specific breakdown. Fodor emphasized that he was not offering necessary and sufficient con- ditions for modularity, but merely a list of features one is likely to find together. He also said that encapsulation is the most important of these features (p. 37), and on one occasion that it is the 'essence' of modularity (p. 7I). Perhaps the thought was that while other features like speed and inaccessibility are indicative of modularity, they are all features that might be possessed by non-modular systems.6 But encapsulation, being the essence of modularity, is what really makes a system modular and explains the other features. On this reading, we move from the superficial features of 4 G. Gigerenzer, 'The Modularity of Social Intelligence', in Byrne and Whiten (eds), Machiavellian Intelligence II, pp. 264-88, at p. 273. We come back to Gigerenzer's view later. 5 But this is a contingent claim. 'Module' and 'input system' are not synonymous, pace A. Karmiloff-Smith, Beyond Modularify (MIT Press, I997), p. 2. 6 There might, as Martin Davies put it in conversation, be 'fools' modules'. ? The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 2000</page><page sequence="4">I48 GREGORY CURRIE AND KIM STERELNY putatively modular systems (speed, inaccessibility, and the like) to their best explanation - encapsulation. Thus a modular system is fast because its encapsulation drastically cuts computational demands on it. Its informa- tional autonomy explains its inaccessibility to introspection, and the poss- ibility of selective loss of just that capacity. Some more recent work on modularity takes domain-specificity rather than encapsulation to be funda- mental.7 The trouble is that domains cannot in general be characterized independently of the modules that deal with them. Whether mate choice is a domain, or an ensemble of distinct domains concerning such things as fidelity, desertion, kin help and punishment, depends on whether we think there is a module for dealing with it, or merely a set of modules, one for each of these other domains. Would anyone think that face recognition is a single domain of problems if there were no evidence that highly selective brain damage can wipe out face recognition and leave other recognition functions intact? However, encapsulation is not merely a theoretical postulate. Fodor argued that the encapsulation of perceptual systems is evidenced directly by the fact that perception does not change when it conflicts with belief, as in cases of visual illusion. He also argued along similar lines that the processing of the semantics and syntax of language is encapsulated, but not the pro- cessing of its pragmatics. So arguments about Fodor-style modules should primarily be arguments about encapsulation, and in particular about whether the system in question imports information from specifically higher cognitive systems. Towards the end of the paper we return to one other feature, proneness to breakdown. Fodor did not claim that the mind is wholly or even largely modular. He argued that while input systems are modular, central systems - those which serve to fix belief - are not modular. For when it comes to the fixation of belief, everything is potentially relevant to everything else. While the lines in a Miiller-Lyer experiment look dissimilar in length, you may conclude that they are in fact the same length. You may believe this for any number of reasons: because measurement shows them to be the same, because some- one you think of as reliable said they were, because you know that when people show you such displays they are generally doing so to illustrate a certain perceptual illusion, and so on. What is the moral of this tale for us, whose interest is not perception but social understanding? It is that philosophers influenced by Fodor's frame- work and formulations who claim that social intelligence is modular might be understood in one of two ways. They might be claiming that there really 7 See, e.g., L. Cosmides andJ. Tooby, 'The Psychological Foundations of Culture', inJ.H. Barkow, L. Cosmides andJ. Tooby (eds), TheAdaptedMind, pp. I9-I36. ?

In contrast, there is a more modest modularity thesis: among the determinants of social judgements are outputs from processes that are encapsulated. We start with the strong claim that social belief fixation is cognitively impenetrable. III. THE MODULARITY OF SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE STRONG THESIS Of all the areas one might choose, social intelligence looks the least likely candidate for being an encapsulated system of belief fixation. Deciding what other people think or want, whether they constitute a threat or offer an opportunity, are highly complex judgements. In making them, information from all kinds of areas might be and often is seen as relevant. Machiavellian reasoning seems to depend on integrating information from a wide variety of sources. This difficulty for the modularist view of social intelligence might be eased by taking advantage of Fodor's further observation that encapsula- tion 'comes in degrees'. A system can be more or less encapsulated. But where is the evidence that in making social judgements there is a significant area of knowledge on which we cannot draw? If Max's confederate says he withdrew money from their London bank today there are all sorts of reasons why Max might suspect him: because it is a public holiday there; because there was a total blackout of the city; because the confederate was spotted in New York at lunchtime. Just where are the bits of information to which we are systematically blind in making our social judgements? The whole genre of the detective story depends on our interest and skill in bringing improbable bits of far-away information to bear on the question of someone's credibility. To suggest that we do not have that skill defies belief. We agree, of course, that there are features of social belief fixation which look a bit like encapsulation. In practice we often do make inferences and decisions in the social area on much less than optimal information, quickly and in ways that seem to be at least close to being automatic and manda- tory.8 But this cannot be the test of encapsulation; otherwise you must say that a system is encapsulated unless all the information the subject possesses is always brought to bear on a problem. Only an inferentially and informa- tionally optimal system would then be non-modular, leaving us with an 8 We are indebted to Jay Garfield here. ? The Editors of 77Te Philosophical Quarterly, 2000</page><page sequence="6">I50 GREGORY CURRIE AND KIM STERELNY extremely impoverished and uninteresting sense of 'encapsulated'. The fact that we do not always exploit relevant information is not fixed by archi- tectural features of the mind. Given time, care and inclination we can bring all our knowledge to bear on social questions. To resurrect the termin- ology of bygone days, this suggests that these limitations on access are limit- ations of performance, not competence. It is not surprising, then, that believers in the social modularity thesis rarely argue explicitly that there is a genuinely Fodorian social module, though we have seen that they sometimes advertise their view in this way. We know of only a couple of arguments specifically designed to show that social reasoning is encapsulated - and then only to a degree. One is due to Gabriel Segal,9 and it is an argument that raises issues that will occupy us throughout this paper. He uses the example of fiction-watching to argue (p. I47) that what he calls 'the psychology faculty' exhibits a 'degree of in- formational encapsulation': Watching a good actor can generate a sort of theory-of-mind illusion; even though one knows that he is really not in pain, or in love, or trying hard to solve a problem, it still seems to one that he is. It appears, then, that relevant information about the actor's real psychological states fails to influence the workings of the psychology faculty. Of course it does look to us as if the actor is in pain: the actor is, after all, putting on a pained expression. But Segal needs more than this as evidence that 'relevant information about the actor's real psychological states fails to influence the workings of the psychology faculty'. A psychology faculty, if there is one, provides us with psychological beliefs. Segal seems to be sug- gesting that this faculty, being encapsulated, delivers not merely recognition that the actor's look is a pained one, but the belief that the actor is in pain when we 'know' that he is not. Such an illusion would be cognitive, con- stituted by a belief that is insulated from much else of what the agent knows. This kind of case is central to the argument for the modularity of social belief fixation. If social belief fixation is modular, we ought to find cases where social belief is fixed by salient, largely perceptual, cues and in defiance of general knowledge - just the kind of case that the actor feigning pain offers us. But does the case really support modularity? It can seem so, especially if we attend to the affective side of watching or reading fiction. Good actors can make their make-believe threats feel very menacing; their make-believe offers seem heartbreakingly generous. Do we believe these to be real threats or generous offers? No. Despite various attempts to make it credible, the view that we believe in the fictions we encounter, even when 9 G. Segal, 'The Modularity of Theory of Mind', in P. Carruthers and P.K. Smith (eds), Theories of Theories of Mind (Cambridge UP, I996), pp. I41-57. ? The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 2000</page><page sequence="7">HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE MODULARITY OF MIND-READING 151 we get deeply absorbed in those fictions, remains a non-starter. We do not rush on stage to Desdemona's defence, or seek to intervene in even the most naturalistically staged aggressions. Since belief is a matter of degree, should we say that we give a limited (very limited) credence to the proposition that the actor is in love, or in pain, or whatever? We should not. Any measurable credence we gave to the proposition that he is would be in conflict with our belief, indeed our knowledge, that he is not. If we say that those engaged by a fiction are limited believers of it, we are bound to say that being engaged by a fiction is an epistemic vice. If we say that those engaged by a murder on stage believe, to some degree, that a murder is about to be committed in front of them, we are bound to say that their unwillingness to intervene is a moral vice. But fictions are not entrapment tools, and responsiveness to fiction is an imaginative virtue, not a vice of any kind. We must find some way of characterizing engagement with fictions that does not depend on claiming that fiction induces belief. One answer, already hinted at, is to invoke the imagination. Seeing the actor's contorted face, we imagine he is in pain, and imagining this can cause us to have some of the uncomfortable sensations we would have if we really believed that he was in pain. And it seems that none of this is a matter of decision or inference; about the only way to stop imagining what the fiction makes it appropriate to imagine is to turn the TV off. If imagination is mandatory, it is starting to sound as if we have found the modularity of social intelligence in an unexpected place! A modular theory of the imagination would be little help to advocates of the modularity of social intelligence, whose concern, we take it, is with the formation of social belief and the behaviour to which such beliefs lead. Imagination may be automatic in something like the way a module is. Given the right experience, imaginative engagement kicks in without conscious decision. But it cannot be a Fodorian module, since it is not encapsulated nor domain-specific. Certainly it is not a social module. Responses to fiction are not restricted to imagining just the thoughts and feelings of actors and fictional characters. Science fiction addicts regularly imagine travel through black holes and battles between giant aphids; they do not just imagine, Nagel-style, what it would be like to fight a giant aphid. So what we are capable of imagining goes beyond the realm of the social or the intentional even in the broadest of senses. It is not plausible that imagination is a domain-specific skill. It might be replied that there is an ambiguity in the idea of domain- specificity, and that our science fiction examples are not decisive against one disambiguation of the idea of a domain-specific imagination machine. Dan Sperber has distinguished between the actual and the proper domain of a ? The Editors of The Philosophical Qu3arterly, 2000</page><page sequence="8">I52 GREGORY CURRIE AND KIM STERELNY module - the proper domain is the domain for which a cognitive device is designed. He points out that radical changes in the human environment might have generated a quite dramatic disjunction between the domain for which a device is actually currently used and the reasoning tasks for which it is adapted and which explain its evolution. So the proper domain of imagin- ation could be social reasoning, even though we actually imagine things in the non-social domain. But we would, of course, need some independent evidence that this is so. It is easy enough to tell plausible Just So stories about other possibilities. Imagination may exist at least partly to make it possible for us to predict the results of our actions in our physical environ- ment. If this is right, imagination is not domain-specific in either sense. And it certainly is not encapsulated. The arguments given already for saying that social belief is not encapsulated apply just as well to social imagining. Our responses to fictions are often informationally open, both synchronically and diachronically. For one thing, those responses draw on general knowledge in a potentially unlimited way. We import a great deal of background know- ledge into our responses to fictions, tacitly assuming that the world of the fiction deviates only in minimal ways from the way we take the real world to be. And our emotional and evaluative responses to the fiction are driven by and reflect our desires and evaluative beliefs. This is not to suggest that we respond to fictions exactly as we do to life, but merely to point out that no account of our responses to fictions which claimed that they are encap- sulated from general belief could succeed. And not only is imagination open to the influence of an unlimited range of beliefs; imaginings themselves com- bine in unrestricted ways. The actor's contorted face can cause us to imagine that the character he plays is in pain - but not always. It can be part of the story that the character is faking pain, and if we are sensitive to subtle clues available within what we already imagine, we can come to imagine that the pain is phoney. We note just one other place where someone is tempted to reach for the encapsulation of social belief formation as a solution to a problem. Giger- enzer (p. 270) mentions 'the frame problem in artificial intelligence' as one reason for thinking that social intelligence is modular. The problem, he says, is that an organism which has to take into account all possibly relevant information (he calls this 'the infinite possibilities to combine elements and relations') would be 'paralysed and unable to react in time'. Assuming that distinct domains, including the social domain, are dealt with by systems of interconnected modules solves the problem, since (p. 277) 'modules that are hierarchically organized can act quickly, as only a few of the branches of the combinatorial tree need to be travelled'. ? The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 2000</page><page sequence="9">HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE MODULARITY OF MIND-READING I53 But wait! What exactly is the problem and how is modularity a solution to it? The frame problem is the problem of how to give an artificial system the capacity to take account of all the information we know a human is able to take account of in forming beliefs. That certainly is a problem, but how can thinking that human intelligence is modular help to solve it? Gigerenzer seems to be suggesting that by assuming modular structure, including some degree of encapsulation, we can suppose that the human mind cuts down on relevant information by having fast, dirty heuristics that act on highly restricted information bases. That would be one way for humans to solve problems in the social domain. But we know they do not do it in that way. We know that people often take into account all sorts of information from all over the place in solving social problems, and that is why it is difficult to mimic social intelligence in an artificial system. Indeed, that is why there is a frame problem in the first place. The frame problem is, as Gigerenzer says, a problem for artificial intelligence: how can a machine take into account all that a human believes? Gigerenzer seems to have it backwards: he wants to solve the frame problem by devising a theory of the human mind for which no frame problem would arise. We conclude that the strong view of social modularity is too strong. Social judgements are not produced by an encapsulated mechanism. IV. THE MODEST THESIS Retreating from the strong modularity view, a natural-sounding alternative is to treat our hypothetical social intelligence module as analogous to perceptual modules. Perceptual modules, as Fodor often notes, do not fix belief. Seeing is not believing, for we can sometimes realize (or think we realize) that perceptual appearances are misleading. But perceptions make a powerful and functionally distinctive contribution to the fixation of belief. So a second reading of the social modularity hypothesis is that the fixation of social belief takes inputs from encapsulated systems.10 However, this second reading needs to be strengthened. Visual percep- tion is probably modular. In that case, since visual perception contributes to the fixation of social belief, social intelligence would come out as modular on the present reading. That is too easy a victory for modularity. Instead we need to say something like this: amongst the systems feeding input to the 10 Curiously, at one point (Modularify of Mind p. 73) Fodor appears to argue that en- capsulation is infectious downwards. So a process which contributes to an unencapsulated mechanism is thereby itself unencapsulated. But that cannot be right, for otherwise the whole notion of encapsulation would unravel. ? The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 2000</page><page sequence="10">I54 GREGORY CURRIE AND KIM STERELNY fixation of social belief are modules that are specifically adaptedfor that very role. Modularized systems for perceptual processing may contribute to the fixa- tion of social belief, but they contribute to the fixation of all sorts of other beliefs as well. Our suggestion is that there is a modularized layer between perception and belief fixation, and this layer adds a specifically social content to what are then the inputs to belief fixation. And the inputs of this module will be the outputs of perceptual modules, not transducer outputs. We shall call a module like this a 'second-order module'. Why call it a 'module' at all? We earlier decided to treat encapsulation, and in particular encapsulation from higher cognitive systems, as the essence of modularity. The claim that there is a social module is thus the claim that there is a system which tags information from below with social markers, and does so even in the face of the belief that those markers do not literally apply, as when we believe, and indeed know, that this person is not friendly, that this statue is not an intentional agent, that these are just geometric shapes - examples we discuss immediately below. V. SAVING THE PHENOMENA Can a modularity hypothesis of this kind, one that avoids attributing modu- larity to belief fixation, explain the phenomena that have been thought of as suggestive of modularity in social cognition? We think it can. First, the thesis of modularity of inputs and the non-modularity of central systems was never meant to suggest that belief fixation is like vote-counting in a democratic election. Someone who believes that belief fixation is non-modular will also believe that the perceptual beliefs we acquire will mostly reflect the contents of the perceptual inputs; as we noted above, one does not search through all the possibly relevant data from memory before forming those beliefs. Thus some perceptual inputs play a privileged role in belief fixation, and their influence can be turned aside only in unusual circumstances. So if there is an input system - a system that provides inputs for belief fixation - which adds socially relevant tags to data from perceptual inputs lower down, we can expect that to be reflected in certain biases in social reasoning and judgement.1 And we can expect this without supposing that the fixation of 11 Such biases appear to be manifested in superior performance on reasoning tasks when they are given a social interpretation. It has been argued that these biases show that social rea- soning is modularized: see D. Cummins, 'Evidence for the Innateness of Deontic Reasoning', Mind and Language, II (I996), pp. I60-90; but cf. M. Oakford and N. Chater, 'Deontic Reason- ing, Modules and Innateness: a Second Look', Mind and Language, II (1996), pp. I91-202. Our conclusion is that such biases show at most that social reasoning is modular at the level of inputs, not that there is a modularized central system for the fixation of social belief. ? The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 2000</page><page sequence="11">HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE MODULARITY OF MIND-READING I55 social belief is modular, but merely on the supposition that certain inputs to social belief fixation - the shiftiness of a look, the openness of a smile - play a privileged role in belief fixation. That, after all, is what the social module is for. Just as the data from perception push us in the direction of certain perceptual beliefs rather than others, this social-intentional module will serve to push us in the direction of certain social beliefs, without itself being the mechanism thatfixes belief. Bearing this in mind, we shall look at some relevant features of our response to the social world. Perceptual illusion is often cited as striking evidence for modularity in perception. We think that there are persistent social illusions, that they add weight to the case for the modularity of social cognition, but that they do not involve the fixation of illusory belief. We have three different types of example in mind. First and most obvious are cases of anthropomorphism, where there is no on-reflection temptation actually to form social beliefs. Our responses to cartoons and puppets indicate how easy it is to get us to imagine intentional- ity in something that only vaguely resembles the face of a living creature. And Heider and Simmel's well known experiments with moving abstract shapes show how natural we find it to imagine mental states around which we can then structure a narrative of the shapes' interaction."2 But, as with the experience of watching an actor, we ought not to take this as evidence for the operation of encapsulated mechanisms which serve to fix our beliefs about mental states - we do not end up believing that the shapes have inten- tionality, any more than we believe that Desdemona has been murdered on stage. Attributions of intentionality where they do not belong do sometimes get to the level of belief, as with people who believe their pets understand English; and such beliefs can certainly be resistant to evidence and reason. But this is too general a phenomenon for it to support the modularity of belief in the social domain. Rather it is evidence for the influence of desire on belief; no one is tempted to suppose that beliefs like 'My children are not taking drugs' are modularized simply because they are irrationally formed and persisted with. In the second kind of case, we dislike or distrust someone even while acknowledging an entire lack of rational basis for that judgement (there are cases that run the other way - the honest-faced scoundrel we find it difficult to mistrust). And some of the time these attributions do influence our inter- actions with people. What this suggests is that emotional responses, or some 12 F. Heider and M.

We can experience fear when we know or believe that the man standing there means us harm, but also when a perception, or even a perceptual memory, is tagged with the appropriate intentional marker. In that case we experience the fear contrary to our judgement, and may even be moved to action by it. Perhaps it is this experi- ence of 'being moved to action' against the dictates of reason that provides the most powerful case for the claim we reject, that social belief fixation is modular. If the feeling that this man is dangerous influences our behaviour, though we can find no supporting reason for the aversion, that seems to be a case of a belief to the effect that he is dangerous, but a belief on which our acknowledged lack of evidence makes no impact. Supposing that the deliverance of an input system can trigger emotion, and hence behaviour, provides an alternative way of seeing the matter, and one for which there is independent evidence. Someone may experience fear, and even behave aversively, at the sight of a spider he knows is harmless. Not all human action is routed through belief fixation followed by practical reasoning. One other thing favours our modest modularism. It offers an evolution- arily plausible compromise between two competing constraints, the need for social intelligence to be highy intelligent, and the need for it to solve problems in real time. People do attempt to deceive us, they sometimes smile when they mean us harm; and the costs to us of their success can be very high indeed. So we cannot afford an automatic transition from the per- ception of a smile to the belief that this is a friend and ally. Encapsulated mechanisms are exploitable. On the other hand, smiles are sufficiently highly correlated with friendly intentions for us not to want the belief system to work through all the possible scenarios for deceptive intent every time we see a smile. For one thing, we would have lost many valuable allies during the time it would take us to come to a conclusion. Tagging the perception with an intentional marker serves to push the belief fixation system in the direction of one conclusion rather than another. Without strong counter- vailing pressure from other beliefs, we shall conclude quickly and efficiently that this is a friend. But the intentional marker always leaves room for such countervailing pressure, and for the consequent rejection of the friendliness hypothesis. VI. WAYS TO MAKE THIS MORE COMPLICATED We have been arguing that the modularity of social intelligence is very like the modularity in perception that Fodor and others have advocated, and not at all a radical modularity of belief fixation. The picture we have presented ? The Editors of The Philosophical Quarterly, 2000</page><page sequence="13">HOW TO THINK ABOUT THE MODULARITY OF MIND-READING 157 has been kept simple so as not to lose sight of the contrast between these two options. But there are complications to the simple picture which might be forced upon us by the empirical data, as well as some open questions. For example, we have been supposing for the sake of the argument that perception, or at least some very substantial part of it, is modular in Fodor's sense. That might turn out not to be quite right: perhaps there are ways to train people not to be subject to the Muller-Lyer illusion, and other bits of evidence for the influence of top-down processing on input analysis. Perhaps there are also ways in which belief can influence the application of lower- level intentional markers. So it may turn out that neither perception nor social intelligence is strictly modular after all. We could live with that. Our bottom line is that the evidence, such as it is, for modularity in social intelligence is at best evidence for modularity at a level prior to that of belief fixation. While we believe that perception and social intelligence both exhibit something close to this kind of modularity, it is entirely an empirical question as to how close the relation really is. Secondly, we have suggested that the intentionality module is 'second- order', distinct from and causally posterior to modular perceptual systems. That also might turn out to be a simplification. It might be that social markers get applied at various stages of perceptual processing, and not simply when perception has done its work. Again this would not bother us, for it would not disturb our claim that the adapted mechanisms of social intelligence generate subdoxastic representations rather than beliefs. If those mechanisms exist, their relations to more general perceptual mechanisms will depend on the nature of the outputs from perceptual systems, and the richness and complexity of the social markers that get applied prior to social belief fixation. To those issues we briefly turn. A question that arises concerning an input module is 'How rich are its computations?'. If the concepts deployed in our visual beliefs are also deployed in the outputs of visual perception, the visual perception modules could not be encapsulated diachronically, even if they are synchronically. If 'T-34 ahead!' is amongst the representations a visual module can present to the central processor for acceptance or rejection, the concepts we learn over our lifetime - 'teapot', 'white-crowned babbler', 'T-34', and the like - would have to be made available to the visual modules. Alternatively, one might suppose that the outputs of the module (more precisely, the assembled structure of modules) of visual perception are much more shallow. Perhaps (as Fodor seems to suggest) only something like Marr's 21/2-dimensional sketch is computed by encapsulated processes. An analogous issue arises for our social intelligence module. Social beliefs can be extraordinarily complex, as when I believe that you hope that she believes that I want this or that. It ?

A further possibility is that the outputs use representational categor- ies that are not part of folk psychology at all. It might be objected that it is simply dogma on our part to assume that the markers provided by the social intelligence module are relatively impoverished. But our point is simply that, in line with Fodor's own views on perceptual modularity, we should assume that the descriptive apparatus available to the module is thin unless the evid- ence strongly suggests that it is not. Refinements much beyond this would then be the product of the unencapsulated belief fixation mechanism. This claim about the modularity of social intelligence affects the options for understanding the ways in which a person's capacity to deal with the social world can break down or fail to develop. It makes a great deal of difference to our interpretation of these breakdowns whether we locate them at the level of belief fixation or at the level of what we have been calling a 'second-order module'. In recent years, for example, a number of psycho- logists have suggested that the central features of autism are the result of damage to a 'theory-of-mind module', the purpose of which is to enable the agent to formulate beliefs about the mental states of others.13 There are a number of reasons why such a view is probably an oversimplification, but our proposal suggests a new way of reading it. Up to now the assumption has been that the theory-of-mind module fixes belief. But our suggestion is that it merely provides intentional markers to the inputs which help to fix belief. Damage to such a module would not in itself mean that the agent was unable to formulate thoughts about thoughts - and indeed there is evidence that people with autism do not suffer so pervasive a disability as this. But if people with autism were impaired in their capacity to apply intentional markers to perceptual contents, it would not be surprising if they were then less than fully competent at forming beliefs about beliefs. Indeed, the often heard remark that people with autism are 'mindblind' would be more appropriate on our model, which assimilates social intelligence to perceptual processing, than it is on a model that pictures autism as a disability of belief fixation. Indeed, there is some evidence that autistic people's disability with the social is more like a perceptual disability than it is like a disability in belief fixation itself. Psychologists have studied people's responses to filmed 13 See A. Leslie and T. German, 'Knowledge and Ability in "Theory of Mind": One-eyed Overview of Debate', in M. Davies and T.

Normal adults can recognize the resulting display as indicative of a human figure, even with very brief display times, and infants only three months old respond selectively to them. And it is clear that this is a matter of the provision of intentional markers, rather than of a modularized system for belief fixation. Seeing such displays in the context of, say, a cartoon or mechanized presentation, we are likely to imagine the pattern as indicative of intentionality, in much the way that we respond to Heider and Simmel's shape patterns. But we may very well not believe that the movement is that of an intentionally-animated human body. Peter Hobson and colleagues studied the responses of autistic subjects to such patterns. While the autistic subjects in Hobson's experiment had no difficulty recognizing human figures as well as various objects from the dis- plays, they were much less apt than controls to describe what the human figures were doing in emotional terms (whereas normal subjects readily described a figure as, e.g., 'sad'), and were poor at judging the emotional states of the figures when specifically asked to do so.'4 Conceivably this could be because we have a module that fixes our beliefs about people's emotional states, and because people with autism suffer damage to the module. Our argument throughout this paper has been that the existence of such a belief fixing module is unlikely. But if there is a second-order module which adds (among other things) emotional markers, and if the module is damaged in autism, then autistic difficulty with emotion recognition would be explained without making implausible assumptions about the modularity of belief fixation. Finally, a word on our responses to fiction. We have argued that they are not to be explained in terms of our coming to believe in the reality of the pain or the love that the actor's expression suggests. But the second-order module we postulate would certainly be triggered by the perceptual inputs from such a scene. What, then, of fictions in modes that deny us the relevant kind of perceptual access, such as literature? The words we see and read would not, presumably, trigger those same responses, at least not directly. If second-order modules play a role here it might be via the subject's mental imagery, serving as a kind of intermediary between the linguistically 14 D. Moore, R.P. Hobson and A. Lee, 'Components of Person Perception: an Investiga- tion with Autistic, Non-autistic, Retarded and Typically Developing Children and Adol- escents', British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 15 (I997), pp. 40I-23. Similarly, Sally Rogers and Bruce Pennington argue that 'early social capacities involving imitation, emotion shar- ing, and theory of mind are primarily and specifically deficient in [infantile autism]', SJ.

Whether imagery can really play this role depends on the answers to questions we cannot settle here about how much overlap there is between perceptual and imagistic systems, and in particular whether imagery retains perception-like connections with affect.'5 Literary theorists have disagreed on the role of imagery in our encounters with literature; our suggestion at this point is simply that the question should be treated as partly one of empirical science. VII. CONCLUSION So our responses to fiction, the cognitive illusions generated by our response to the expression of emotion and intention, our anthropomorphizing responses to animals, devices and illustrations, all support the supposition that social intelligence depends on a module that takes its input from percep- tual modules and which itself feeds to central belief forming mechanisms. But believers in the modularity of social cognition make an error when they claim that their thesis entails the modularity of central systems. We have suggested that a more modest thesis, involving second-order modules as in- put systems, is capable of explaining what genuinely needs to be explained. Our beliefs about the social are no more modular than are our beliefs about the shapes, sizes and colours of things.'6 University of Nottingham; Victoria University, Wellington 15 Cognitive scientists are divided on this question. For a recent defence of the view that there is a substantial overlap see S. Kosslyn, W. Thompson and N. Alpert, 'Neural Systems Shared by Visual Imagery and Visual Perception', Neuroimage, 6 (i997), pp. 320-34. Another issue that would have to be confronted here is whether the relevant imagery must always be conscious. 16 This paper arose out of discussions at the ARC-funded workshop on modularity, University of Tasmania, December I998.
