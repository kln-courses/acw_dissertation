<plain_text><page sequence="1">788 Slavic and East European Journal reference sources such as Slater's Handbook of Soviet and East European Films and Filmmak- ers (1992). Growing student interest in Russian and East European film is another reason this is a timely work, and there is much in it that will appeal to current and potential teachers of such courses. Its entries are not limited to famous names, but also include one for each country covered, important institutions and movements in filmmaking (VGIK, Yugoslav Black Wave), and longer entries on topics of special importance ("Gypsies in East European Cin- ema," "Holocaust Film," "Women in Eastern European Cinema" [for which, unfortunately, there is not a Russian counterpart]). These entries will help instructors organize thematic units within courses or entire theme-based courses. If relevant, the entries are followed by a bibliography and list of other films produced/acted in/directed/written. There are informative introductory essays on East European and Russian cinema. The value of this book is further enhanced by occasional plot summaries, especially of lesser-known films, the inclusion of related web resources, the listing of film titles in the original and English translation, and the fact that the authors are not afraid to share their opinions with readers (e.g., "the intellectual but somewhat pretentious work of Hungarian Andrfs Jeles" [96]). Since this reference source is not necessarily intended to be read from cover to cover, it is also helpful that there is a significant amount of overlap among entries and that the entries are cross-referenced well. The BFI Companion to Eastern European and Russian Cinema, which is distributed in the United States by Indiana University Press, belongs in the library of every institution that offers cinema courses. This outstanding volume will be attractive to advanced students and aficiona- dos of film as an up-to-date source of information about major Russian and East European directors, screenwriters, film musicians, film journals, actors, and camera operators. Instruc- tors will find it useful as they prepare and teach film courses.

Among the forty-one contributors to this volume are historians, journalists, literary critics, linguists, philosophers, sociologists, cartog- raphers, ecologists, specialists in art history, architecture, theater, and music. The Interna- tional Conference "The Phenomenon of St. Petersburg," on which the current publication is based, encouraged the expression of opinions, "no matter how nontraditional and daring, about the real or imagined charms concealed in the notion 'Saint Petersburg"' (7). The authors responded with texts of different genres and styles that engage with one another in an internal polemic. Published in anticipation of the city's tercentennial anniversary, this volume heralds what promises to be a surge of publications associated with the jubilee. The title announces the leitmotif of the collection: the phenomenon (or rather the many phenomena) of St. Petersburg. In terms either direct or figurative, each essay in the volume addresses the central question: What makes the city unique? Some authors consider the idiosyncratic features of St. Petersburg in broad, contemplative terms; others confine their observations to individual case studies. For instance, D. L. Spivak proposes to view the city as a self-sufficient local civilization, the systematic study of which should be conducted within an independent field of knowledge, "KyJIbTypoJIorHa rleTep6ypra." V. A. Bachinin analyzes the "phenomenology of the St. Petersburg spirit," the mysterious essence revealed through many</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 789 manifestations of local culture. "Crucified" between East and West, the city's soul is akin to that of Dostoevsky's Stavrogin, an "anthropomorphic micro-model of Petersburg civilization" (28). The city's location at the crossroads of cultures is reflected in its psychological bifurca- tion as well: on the level of phenomenon, St. Petersburg is beautiful; on the level of noumenon, it is demonic. In contrast to Bachinin, G. S. Lebedev foregrounds the multicul- tural synthesis of Petersburg as a unique megalopolis in the Baltic region of Europe. In a similar spirit, I. V. Sakharov represents Petersburg as a "sign of European unity." St. Peters- burg is a "little Europe," he argues, defined by a distinct mentality which is equally receptive of Russia and Western Europe. The unique mentality of St. Petersburg is the main subject of L. N. Pushkarev's essay. According to the author, diverse social groups at the time of Peter the Great-reformers, old nobility, peasants, foreigners-were differentiated by their own, dis- tinct modes of thought, but the city united all these worldviews into a single "Petersburg spirit," which distinguished its inhabitants from the rest of the country. In his approach, Pushkarev's article is reminiscent of another recent publication, ncuxo.ozu nlemep6ypza u nemep6ypwcte6 3a mpu cmojemuR (1999). In the context of the volume's overarching theme, V. P. Leonov draws our attention to specific institutions in which the phenomenon of the city manifests itself. The first Russian library, founded in 1714, is one such institution-a major attraction for foreign visitors and local scholars alike. Memoirs of foreign travelers, reviewed in Leonov's article, testify to the strong impression that the future Library of the Academy of Sciences produced in the early eighteenth century. V. N. Zaitsev's contribution on contemporary libraries analyzes the infor- mation space of St. Petersburg at the turn of the twenty-first century and concludes with a legislative proposal to create a unified network of libraries there. benooMeH Hemep6yp2a invites a broad range of methods and debates. In their historical orientation, however, the majority of the essays gravitate towards the city's origins. The figure of its founder, Peter the Great, looms large in this book and indeed grows into a phenomenon of its own. A polemical contribution by Iu. N. Bespiatykh (editor of the volume, as well as of the recent Hemep6ypz Hempa I uHocmpa-HHbix onucanHux and Ilemep6ypz AHbti HoaHHo6Hbl 6 uHocmpaHHbix onucaltuHx) represents the city's founding as an adventurous, whimsical undertaking of Peter. The author invokes historical evidence to demonstrate that the city came into being simply because the tsar wanted it to, the resistance of nature and society notwithstanding. Peter the Great literally willed into existence what Dostoevsky later described as the "most abstract and premeditated city in the whole world." Understandably, the equestrian statue of the tsar, the Bronze Horseman, has been a recognizable symbol of the city for generations. In the words of S. 0. Androsov, whose essay contextualizes the monu- ment within the European tradition of equestrian statuary, the Bronze Horseman is "a genu- ine phenomenon of St. Petersburg," inseparable from its literature and history. G. G. Proshin, author of another study devoted to the Bronze Horseman, examines the tradition of sculptural representations of Peter the Great. Proshin documents fifteen monuments to Peter within city limits, the majority dating back to the early twentieth century. This tradition, the author opines, came to an end in the summer of 1991 when Mikhail Shemiakin's Peter appeared on the grounds of the Peter and Paul Fortress. Shemiakin's statue is the "other" Peter, "the bronze mannequin" which has long lived in the Russian subconscious, an embodiment of the "Just you wait!" (YKO Te6.a!) that Pushkin's Evgeny hurled at the "bronze effigy." Continuing the theme of this strange-terrible and ridiculous-Peter is V. E. Retsepter's open letter to Shemiakin, where the dramatist engages the sculptor in a dialogue on contemporary represen- tations of the tsar. The city that Karamzin called "the brilliant mistake" of Peter the Great does not yield easily to demystification. This collection does not aim to provide a comprehensive definition of the Petersburg phenomenon; instead, it revisits some of the traditional aspects of the city in light of the contemporary concerns of its citizenry. There is something for everyone in this volume.</page><page sequence="3">790 Slavic and East European Journal Aside from the interests already mentioned, individual essays address a wide range of topics. T. A. Bazarova, V. V. Kukushkina and N. K. Shablaeva review the first plans of the city and current scholarship on eighteenth-century cartography; I. A. Golubeva discusses archival mate- rials pertaining to Stolpiansky's unfinished multi-volume project Hcmopu IHemep6yp2a; M. S. Shtiglits profiles the industrial architecture of St. Petersburg from the 1830s to the 1930s; T. S. Tsarkova writes about the Petersburg tradition of gravestone epitaph poetry; L. Salmon analyzes Dovlatov's Leningrad as "the least Soviet" and "most humorous" city in Russia; R. Sh. Ganelin and V. A. Nardova address the opposition between the city's local government and state power on the eve of 1917; V. A. Znamensky alerts us to the catastrophic condition of the local waterway system; V. M. Gaevsky and V. A. Viazovkina unfold the story of the Petersburg school of ballet and its "absolute embodiment," the white swan. In a tradition going back to Antsiferov's classic ,lyua I7emep6ypza, H. P. Longo represents St. Petersburg as an anthropo- morphic genius loci, which continues to dwell in Russian literature. Contributions to this volume are uneven: some are scholarly articles, others are impression- istic musings. A certain lyrical quality (at times excessive) permeates a number of the essays in this collection. Underscoring this lyrical dimension, poetic photographs of the city's misty vistas are sprinkled throughout the book. It is as if despite the broad scope of this collection, the phenomenon of St. Petersburg still remains a mystery waiting to be fully deciphered. The superlative terms punctuating the text - "the most postmodern city in the world," for example (96)- hardly offer a key to the city's enigma. But then there are images that do express the city's peculiar unity through difference, including the memorable "cJioeHbini napor" analogy (414). PeHnoMeH Iemep6yp2a, dedicated to the memory of D. S. Likhachev, will be of interest to many of the city's enthusiasts. Katia Dianina, Harvard University Mireille Massip. La Verite est fille du temps: Alexandre Kasem-Beg et l'emigration russe en Occident 1902-1977. Preface de Marc Raeff. Geneve: Georg Editeur, 1999. 758 pp., paper. In April 1957, Russian emigres and AATSEEL colleagues were shaken by media reports that Alexander Kasem-Beg, who had disappeared some months earlier during a visit to Switzer- land, had resurfaced in the USSR. An interview in Pravda, apparently contradicted by coded messages, gave rise to a tangle of rumors. Had Kasem-Beg been kidnapped? Blackmailed? Was he really undergoing treatment there for an eye ailment? Had he entered a monastery? Was he a Soviet spy as some had long suspected? Had he gone crazy? At the time of his disappearance, Kasem-Beg was on the faculty of Connecticut College in New London, a family man whose wife taught in the same department (and had to cover his courses until a replacement was found). For twenty more years until his death in 1977, Kasem-Beg was employed at the Moscow patriarchate, a captive perhaps, but a privileged one with a fine apartment and a good salary (500 r). He remarried (under Soviet law his first marriage could be dissolved after three years' abandonment), though he never dared own up to Svetlana Kasem-Beg in New London, to whom he wrote regularly, asking for American socks, toilet- ries, books and writing supplies. Before coming to the US, Kasem-Beg had been the head (Glava) of the monarchist Mladoross party (the Jeunes russes), which supported the tsar-pretender Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich and later his more reluctant son Vladimir Kirillovich. Mladoross members were a mixed group, some having fascist tendencies, others being pro-Soviet, still others vacillating between the two poles as they tried to foster the interests of Mother Russia -and</page></plain_text>
