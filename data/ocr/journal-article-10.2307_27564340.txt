Portland, OR: Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2006. xix, 343 pp. doi: 10.1017/S0364009408001098 I should say at the outset that I am a longtime fan and friend of Menachem Kellner, so anyone who wants to accuse me of bias is free to do so. Still, I think Maimonides ' Confrontation with Mysticism is one of the most important books on Maimonides to be published in the last thirty years and quite possibly one of the most important in the field of Jewish philosophy. The writing is clear and crisp, and the scholarship is impeccable. The book explains not just how radical Maimo nides' dissatisfaction with the Judaism of his day was, but how radical his opinions are for most Jews of our day. Everyone knows that Maimonides went to great lengths to purge Judaism of any trace of anthropomorphism, insisting that much of the sacred literature of Judaism cannot be read in a literal fashion. Beyond that, everyone knows that he also argued that God does nothing that is futile or frivolous, meaning that there are reasons behind all of the commandments, including the hukkim. Finally, everyone knows that he tried to introduce dogmatic content into Judaism by putting forward thirteen principles that every Jew is obliged to 190</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews accept. But not everyone knows that Maimonides' naturalism went so deep that he regarded much of halakhah as contingent in the sense that if historical circum stances had been different, halakhah would be different. Nor does everyone know that Maimonides denied there is an essential or ontological difference between holy things and profane, that Hebrew is inherently superior to other languages, and that Jews are biologically distinct from other peoples. We can understand Maimonides' views as a result of his thorough repudia tion of mythology. The world of mythology is populated with occult forces inha biting such things as angels, shrines, sacred artifacts, magical names, magical numbers, and special incantations. As Kellner shows, Maimonides would have none of this. All that exists is God (who is beyond the comprehension of the human intellect) and the realm of created beings, none of which bear any resem blance to God. Gone are semidivine intermediaries such as angels with wills of their own, demons, sefirot, or anything that offers a substantive interpretation of kavod, shekhinah, or created light. Whether we refer to Maimonides' view as nominalistic or naturalistic is immaterial; the important point is that holiness is conferred on things for historical or institutional reasons?it is not a property they possess in their own right. To use Kellner 's example, radioactivity existed before Geiger discovered a way to measure it. By the same token, many Jews have said or would say that holy places, persons, nations, times, or artifacts possess a special quality that cannot be measured by natural means but that gives them a special status. For Judah Halevi, Jews are closer to God than anyone else, and Jews in the Land of Israel are better able to discern the nature of that God than Jews living elsewhere. For Maimonides, God did not choose Israel; rather, Abraham, the first Jew, discovered God on the basis of rational arguments that were accessible to everyone. Similarly, the Land of Israel is holy not because of what it is but because of what happened there. Suppose, however, that history had taken a different turn?that the first person to discover God by rational arguments had been a Navajo. As Kellner shows, Maimonides' position would require him to say that the Navajo were the chosen people, that Navajo was the language in which God's will was made manifest, and that the Torah would reflect the social attitudes and historical cir cumstances of Navajo culture. Or, suppose the Jewish people had not forgotten Abraham's arguments and turned to paganism during the Egyptian captivity. Then Maimonides' position would require him to say that much of the legislation of the Torah, including the laws dealing with the sacrificial cult, would serve no purpose. In short, sacrificing animals to God brings about no ontological change, nor does the modern equivalent of prayer and worship. These practices were chosen because the people needed institutional reminders of who they were and what they were supposed to be committed to; if the people had behaved in a different fashion, such reminders would not have been necessary. By implication, ritual purity does not describe an objective state, such as dirt or decay, but a halakhic state that is intelligible only within a halakhic context. In regard to the next life, Kellner argues that in Maimonides' hands, the claim "all Israelites have a share in the world to come" should be taken as saying that "Israelite" and "one who has a share in the world to come" 191</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews are coextensive. Because Israelites who do not accept Maimonides' thirteen principles?in particular the first five, which deal with metaphysical issues?are excluded from the world to come, Maimonides cannot be using "Israelite" and "descendent of the patriarchs" synonymously. Rather, "Israelite" must mean "one who has achieved a sufficient degree of intellectual perfection to see that the first five principles are true." This means that there is a whole class of what Kellner, following Steven Schwarzschild, calls "Jewish non-Jews"?people not descended from the patriarchs who nonetheless accept monotheism and reject ido latry. So, Aristotle would qualify as an Israelite and enjoy a share in the world to come, whereas many kabbalists would not. Exit chauvinism, enter universalism. The reference to kabbalists takes us into the historical dimension of Kellner's book. Maimonides strove mightily to pull the ground out from under what could be best described as proto-kabbalist literature, including Sefer yezirah and the hekhalot literature. But Kellner is honest enough to admit that, in large part, he failed. Instead of converting Jews to rationalism and universalism, Maimonides spawned an enor mous protest movement, the kabbalistic tradition, which remythologized Judaism and had much greater influence. As Kellner sadly notes, "little of Maimonidean Judaism can be found in the contemporary Orthodox world" (289). Why? One can only speculate that Maimonides' naturalism is a hard pill to swallow. With the long lens of history, it is also possible to say that Maimonides spawned another movement that would have disturbed him: liberal Judaism. Kellner is right to emphasize that although Maimonides viewed halakhah as contingent in the sense that different historical circumstances would have resulted in different legislation, one is obliged to obey it. Though animal sacrifice affects no ontological change, given that the ancient Israelites needed it to adhere to the teachings of the Torah, it is still part of halakhah. When the Messiah comes and sovereignty is restored to Israel, it will have to be reinstituted. No doubt, reasons can be given for Maimonides' conser vatism (see 239). The problem is that for many Jews, these reasons are unpersuasive. If halakhah reflects the historical conditions in which it emerged, and if these con ditions underwent radical changes, why should we still be obliged to do what we did before? Though animal sacrifice once attracted people to the teachings of the Torah, in today's world, it would have the opposite effect. Plausible as this argument is, Maimonides could not accept it. The only way to exclude animal sacrifice from a rebuilt Temple would be to say that the laws of the Torah are not valid for all time. Though this conclusion would sit well with the contingent nature of those laws given one meaning of the word "contingent," it is not the meaning Maimonides intends. For him, what is contingent can still be obli gatory. The best compliment I can pay Kellner is to say that Maimonides ' Confron tation with Mysticism has clarified these issues in a way that few other books have.
