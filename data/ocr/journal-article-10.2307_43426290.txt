<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICS Eight Lectures OH Theoretical Physics. Delivered at Columbia University in 1909. By Max Planck. Translated by A. P. Walls. [Pp. ix + 130.] (New York: Columbia University Press, 1915.) These lectures which Planck delivered as foreign lecturer at Columbia University in the spring of 1909 have for their object the presentation of a System of Theoretical Physics based on certain points of view which are explained in the first lecture. Whereas, undoubtedly, the materials of Physics are the specific perceptions of man as received through the channels of sense, yet all modern advance in the subject has been attained by a definite elimination from all physical ideas of the anthropomorphic elements, particularly those of specific sense perceptions. This may be seen, for instance, by consideration of such ideas as tone, colour, temperature, etc. Thus the definitions of these quantities are to-day not derived from perception through the corresponding senses, but tone and colour are defined through a vibration number or wave length, and tempera- ture through a scale based on the second law of thermodynamics. The thesis on which Planck proceeds is questionable, but the exposition based on it is interest- ing, and gives an excellent idea of some of the problems now agitating the minds of physicists, in particular the conditions attending irreversible phenomena, the atomic theory of matter, Heat Radiation, Relativity, and the foundation of Dynamics on a single principle such as the Principle of Least Action. Much of the material of these lectures is to be found in the author's t≈• Thermodynamics</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 163 and "Heat Radiation," and in some respects his views on certain points have changed of late, but the lectures present in bold outline the most important advances in the present System of Physics.
