HORNBERGER, MD, MS,*,t ALAN M. GARBER, MD, PHD,*,t'' AND JOHN R. JEFFERY, MD, FRCP(C)? OBJECTIVES. National registry data suggest that mortality rates among pa- tients with end-stage renal disease are lower in Canada than in the United States. Casemix and treatment variables, although limited in such instances, do not explain this difference. Using a more complete set of casemix and treatment variables from clinical databases, this study assesses mortality, hospital admission, and the cost of medical care for patients with end-stage renal disease treated in Manitoba, Canada and the United States. METHODS. Mortality rates were compared in patients with end-stage renal disease treated in the Province of Manitoba and a random sample of US pa- tients enrolled in the US Renal Data System Casemix Severity Study. Hospi- tal admission rates and costs of care were compared in Manitoba patients and in patients with end-stage renal disease in a large health care organization in Detroit, Michigan. RESULTS. Levels of serum creatinine, urea, and estimated glomerular filtra- tion rate indicated more severe renal impairment at the outset of treatment in Manitoba than in the United States. Manitoba patients were more than twice as likely to receive kidney transplants as US Renal Data System patients. No patients in Manitoba used reprocessed dialyzers, compared with 57% of US Renal Data System patients. After adjustment for all casemix and treatment variables, the mortality rate was 47% higher in the United States. The hospi- tal admission rate in Detroit was 41% lower than the hospital admission rate in Manitoba, which primarily reflects the doubled rate of transplantation in Manitoba. Adjusted total monthly costs were $503 higher in Detroit than in Manitoba. CONCLUSIONS. The higher mortality rates in the United States cannot be fully explained by adjustments for observable casemix or treatment vari- ables. Further research is needed to identify factors that explain how Mani- toba achieves a lower mortality rate while paying less for end-stage renal disease care than the United States.

In most cases, data were collected from a nonrandom sample of a country's or region's population or con- tained little information on the baseline demographic and health characteristics of patients. All of these studies examined dis- eases or services in which medical care in the United States is reimbursed through combinations of publicly and privately fi- nanced systems.5'9-11 The wide range of re- imbursement mechanisms may confound conclusions about how a single-payer sys- tem implemented in the United States would influence outcomes. The US Medicare End-Stage Renal Dis- ease program, which reimburses medical care for more than 92% of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), represents a single-payer system for a defined group of Americans.12,13 Comparison of the costs and clinical impact of this program with its counterpart in Canada would provide a unique demonstration of the effect of a sin- gle-payer-financed health care plan as it might be applied in the United States. This study reports the results of multivariate re- gression techniques, adjusting for casemix and treatment variables, applied to data on patients with ESRD in Manitoba and in the United States to assess differences in mor- tality rates, hospital admission rates, and cost of medical care. We secondarily exam- ine the sources of Canadian-US variations in costs of medical care assigned to outpa- tient renal-replacement therapy, physician reimbursement, and inpatient hospital care. Methods We performed multivariate regression analyses of clinical and administrative data- bases adjusting for detailed casemix and treatment characteristics. We describe the data sources, data elements (clinical and cost of medical care), and methods used to perform statistical analyses. Data Sources We obtained data from three sources: (1) the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) Casemix Severity Study (n = 5,192), (2) computerized clinical and admin- istrative records at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan (n = 1,578), and (3) charts of all patients with ESRD in Manitoba, Can- ada (n = 549). Subjects in the USRDS Casemix Severity study included a random sample of 5 % of all patients who began end- stage renal disease treatment in 1986 or 1987. Subjects were followed until April, 1992. Details of this database and its validity have been published elsewhere.14 The USRDS Casemix Severity Study data- base does not include data on costs of medi- cal care. To supplement the USRDS data- base, we collected data from all patients enrolled for ESRD treatment at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan between 1983 and 1990. Henry Ford Hospital has mortality rates comparable with US national averages and is one of the few facilities nationwide to have collected both clinical and cost data prospectively during the study period. Its clinical database has been used extensively to evaluate temporal changes in their pro- gram and to assess the quality of care with time.15,16 We collected, through chart abstraction, data elements similar to those found in the USRDS Casemix Severity Study for all pa- tients treated for ESRD in the Province of 687 Vol. 35, No. 7</page><page sequence="3">HORNBERGER ET AL Manitoba, Canada between 1983 and 1989, inclusive. Transplant and mortality rates in Manitoba are comparable with the Cana- dian national averages.17 Further, adminis- trative procedures by ESRD facilities in Manitoba facilitated chart abstraction to col- lect the detailed casemix and treatment vari- ables necessary to conduct this study. Clinical Data Elements We obtained information on patient demographics (date of birth, gender, ethnic background), cause of renal failure, history of comorbid conditions at the start of end- stage renal disease treatment (eg, myocar- dial infarction), and level of serum chemis- tries at the time of first ESRD treatment (ie, urea, creatinine, phosphorus, albumin, cal- cium). We also obtained information on the modality and date of initiating first and sub- sequent types of end-stage renal disease treatment and date of death, if applicable. We estimated patients' renal function at the start of treatment using the Cockcroft-Gault approximation of creatinine clearance.18 We estimated patients' total body water using Watson's method.19 Cost Data Elements We distinguished three categories of costs for patients with ESRD: physician fees, out- patient services, and inpatient services. Detroit. In the United States, physicians and outpatient dialysis services are reim- bursed at a fixed monthly rate per patient. In 1990, physicians providing dialysis services received a monthly fee of $209. The Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA) also reimbursed outpatient dialysis facilities at a rate of $139 per dialysis session. This reim- bursement covers building rents, staff (nurses, technicians, and administrative), and supplies (machines, dialyzers, water treatment, tubing, reuse materials). For each patient at a Detroit dialysis facility, we col- lected data on the number of dialysis ses- sions performed per month. We multiplied this quantity by the reimbursement per ses- sion to obtain an estimate of total costs of outpatient dialysis per month. We also col- lected data on the Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) assessment and total amount col- lected from Henry Ford Hospital's billing re- cords submitted to HCFA. Manitoba. The Manitoba Health Services Commission provided data on all physician fees for the treatment of patients with ESRD in Manitoba for the years 1984 to 1988. The data included the date, type, and fee for the service rendered, representing all expenses paid to physicians for their clinical duties in the province except for reimbursement to directors of dialysis facilities for their ad- ministrative functions. We obtained data from a detailed cost report of outpatient di- alysis services at the Manitoba Health Sci- ences Center. This center had 75% of the pa- tients in the Manitoba database. We also collected medical record data on the date of admission, date of discharge, and primary admitting diagnoses for each hospitalization between the years 1987 and 1990. Because the per patient cost of providing routine-maintenance hemodialysis varies less than the costs of inpatient services, we assumed that monthly outpatient dialysis expenses were identical across patients in Manitoba. Under Canada's system of global budgeting, medical centers individually con- tract with the provincial government to pro- vide full services for that year. We applied the method for calculating inpatient costs described by Redelmeier and Fuchs.9 Diag- noses were classified into one of the 500 Ca- nadian Casemix Groups (CMG). Canada de- veloped a system of applying Resource-Intensity Weights to each CMG, much like the Diagnosis-Related Group weighting system in the United States. These weighting schemes were designed to reflect the resources needed to provide care for these diagnostic categories. We obtained the weighting scheme from the Hospital Medical Records Institute (HMRI) Resource 688 MEDICAL CARE</page><page sequence="4">COSTS OF END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE Intensity Weight 1990 Redevelopment Pro- ject.20 To convert these weights into costs per CMG, we collected data on total hospital operating expenditures and the distribution of diagnostic categories for the hospital for the two hospitals in Winnipeg, to which more than 90% of patients with end-stage renal disease are admitted in the province. We calculated the cost per CMG as a func- tion of the hospital's total operating expen- ditures multiplied by the fraction of all Re- source Intensity Weights used for patients admitted for that CMG (Appendix A). We then estimated the cost per month by as- signing the cost per CMG for every instance a patient was admitted with a particular CMG. If an admission started in one month and ended in another month, a fraction of the total costs for that CMG was attributed to the fraction of time the patient was hospi- talized during that month. We adjusted costs to 1992 US dollars by inflating costs at a fixed annual rate of 4.04%, based on the Consumer Price Index estimates of the rate of inflations during these years.21 We deflated Canadian to US dollars by 25% using the Purchase-Power Parity Index during 1987 to 1990.5 Because some patients experienced extreme costs, particularly for hospital admissions, we used the logarithm of costs for all statistical com- parisons. Statistical Analyses We assessed casemix- and treatment-ad- justed differences in mortality between sub- jects in the Manitoba database and subjects in the USRDS Casemix Severity Study data- base. We assessed casemix- and treatment- adjusted differences in hospital admission rates and cost of medical care between sub- jects in the Manitoba database and subjects in the Detroit database. Mortality. We performed Cox-propor- tional hazards regression analyses to assess differences in mortality between Manitoba and USRDS patients, adjusting for other casemix and treatment characteristics. We initially assessed total duration from start of ESRD treatment until death, loss to follow- up, or the end of the study period (12/31/90). In Manitoba, we have data on all patients from the start of regular maintenance dialy- sis. The date of the start of ESRD treatment for USRDS patients was recorded from the Medicare Evidence Form (HCFA-2728).22 For many patients, eligibility for Medicare may be delayed up to 90 days after the start of regular maintenance dialysis. Conse- quently, there may be patients who began regular maintenance care and died in the 90 days before Medicare eligibility was estab- lished. To make the start of ESRD treatment comparable between databases, we omitted the 17 patients from the Manitoba database who died in the first 90 days. We also in- creased the date of starting ESRD treatment for all other Manitoba patients by 90 days. To account for the effect of different years of starting dialysis, we included dummy variables for the year the patient started ESRD treatment. Because there were miss- ing data for most casemix and treatment variables (eg, 4% missing data for age, 20% for myocardial infarction), we used the mul- tiple imputation method described by Ru- bin23'24 to assign missing values and also ran regressions by deleting all observations with incomplete data. We estimated casemix- and treatment- adjusted mortality between countries using a time-varying specification of the Cox-pro- portional hazards model. In this model, we assume that there are two observations for patients who underwent transplantation. For patients who underwent transplantation during the study period, the first observation represents the duration from the start of di- alysis treatment until they were lost to fol- low-up, the study period ended, or they re- ceived a transplant. For these patients, the second observation represents the duration from transplantation until they were lost to follow-up, the study period ended, or they died. The model assumes that these obser- 689 Vol. 35, No. 7</page><page sequence="5">HORNBERGER ET AL vations are correlated within a subject. Pa- tients who did not undergo transplantation had only one observation from the start of dialysis treatment until they were lost to fol- low-up, the study period ended, or they died. We assigned patients undergoing dialysis into one of nine dialysis treatment catego- ries. These categories were based on whether (1) the patient underwent hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis; (2) if hemodialysis, whether reprocessed dialyz- ers were used; and (3) if hemodialysis, if the patient had been recorded in one of four di- alysis-treatment duration categories per session (&lt;180 minutes; &gt;180 minutes and &lt;210 minutes; &gt;210 and &lt;240 minutes; and &gt;240 minutes). We performed a separate regression to as- sess mortality for patients during the period they were treated with dialysis. In this in- stance, there was only one observation per subject, the duration from start of dialysis treatment until they were lost to follow-up, they received transplants, the study period ended, or they died. Hospital Admission Rates and Length of Stays. We modeled the monthly admis- sion rate in Manitoba and Detroit, adjusted for casemix and treatment variables, using a logistic regression model. Specifically, the logistic regression model estimated the ef- fect of covariates on the logs odds that the patient will be admitted in a given month. Because the probability that a patient will be admitted in one month is likely to be corre- lated with his or her having been admitted in other months, we estimated robust stand- ard errors using the methods described by Huber.24'25 Specifically, the model permits errors associated with observations within patients to be correlated, but requires errors associated with observations between pa- tients to be independent. Cost of Medical Care. For each month, we calculated the sum of inpatient, outpa- tient, and physician costs for each patient. We used a logarithmic transformation of to- tal costs because the multiple hospitaliza- tions experienced by some patients led to a skewed cost distribution. We used linear re- gression techniques to estimate the differ- ence in log monthly costs between Mani- toba and Detroit, adjusted for casemix and treatment variables. Because a patient's log costs in one month may predict the same patient's log costs in another month, we again estimated robust standard errors us- ing the method described by Huber.24'25 Results Table 1 shows patient demographic and health characteristics for patients in Mani- toba and the USRDS. The average age was comparable in both populations. More men than women were enrolled for renal-re- placement treatment. Blacks comprised a larger fraction of patients in the databases from the United States than in that from Manitoba. By contrast, Native Americans comprised a larger fraction of Manitoba pa- tients. At the start of ESRD, anthropomorphic measures (ie, height, weight, and total body water) were similar for patients in different databases. Rates of diabetes as the primary cause of renal disease were comparable in Manitoba and USRDS patients. Rates of co- morbid conditions were similar in both populations, except for hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients in Manitoba had higher serum creatinine levels than USRDS patients. Manitoba patients also had higher blood urea nitrogen and phosphorus levels and had lower serum albumin levels. Estimated creatinine clearances were approximately 12% lower for Manitoba patients than USRDS patients. With higher phosphorus levels and lower albumin levels, this sug- gests that patients in Manitoba had a more advanced stage of renal insufficiency at the start of ESRD treatment. 690 MEDICAL CARE</page><page sequence="6">COSTS OF END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE TABLE 1.

We in- cluded a second-order polynomial for creat- inine clearance in the model and used indica- tor variables for each 1-unit difference in creatinine clearances between 0 and 20 mL/minute. We found a slightly increased mortality rate for patients with creatinine clearances that were less than 5 mL/minute and greater than 15 mL/minute. Neither of these specifications of creatinine clearance significantly affected the relative mortality rate of USRDS patients compared with Manitoba patients. Patients undergoing hemodialysis who used reprocessed dialyzers at longer dialy- sis-treatment times per session had relative mortality rates greater than 1.17 compared with similar patients who did not use re- processed dialysis at the longest treatment time per session, an effect of reuse described in other studies.29'30 When evaluating only the duration of survival until transplantation or death, the adjusted mortality rate for USRDS patients remained significantly higher than for Manitoba patients. In con- trast, when evaluating the duration of sur- vival from transplantation to death, the ad- justed mortality rate for USRDS patients was comparable with that for Manitoba pa- tients. Sensitivity Analyses. Table 4 shows the results of additional regressions that as- sess the independent effects of the model assumptions on the relative mortality rates between USRDS and Manitoba pa- tients. These regressions help assess whether relative mortality rates change substantially when the specification of the regression model changes. When confining the analyses to just white patients younger than 65 years old (ie, patients who are com- parable in both countries and with a low likelihood of being denied renal-replacement therapy even if a significant number of comor- bidities were present), the relative mortality rates increased to 1.56 compared with the base-case rate of 1.47.

Patients in Detroit had more hospital admissions per year and signifi- cantly shorter lengths of stay than patients in Manitoba. Notably, the hospital admission rate for renal transplantation was 29% lower in Detroit than in Manitoba. The variation in hospital lengths of stay in Manitoba predomi- nantly reflect the year-to-year variation in the rates of transplantation.

The cost of inpatient care in the United States is approximately $120 less per month than inpatient costs in Man- itoba, but physician reimbursements and the cost of outpatient renal-replacement care are higher in the United States. Strengths and Limitations This study overcomes some of the limita- tions of other international comparisons by using representative subjects, improving the casemix and treatment adjustments, and as- sessing a disease for which care for most pa- tients in the United States is financed almost exclusively by the US government instead of by a mix of private and public financing. Representativeness of Subjects. For mortality comparisons, we ensured repre- sentativeness by using a random sample of patients enrolled in the US Medicare ESRD Program and a full sample of patients in Manitoba. Because hospital admission and cost data were not available in the USRDS database, we obtained data from a resource that had collected data prospectively on all its patients during the study period. Results on the costs associated with physician reim- bursement and outpatient renal-replace- ment treatment are likely to vary little from other regions of the country because they are based on capitated reimbursement rates set by the US government. The costs of inpa- tient care may vary across regions of the United States because of variations in hospi- tal admission rates. Our finding of shorter 694 MEDICAL CARE</page><page sequence="10">COSTS OF END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE lengths of stay and lower admission rates, however, are consistent with many other studies comparing the United States with Canada.

We used one of the most comprehensive clinical databases available worldwide-the USRDS Casemix Severity Study-to compare outcomes of ESRD pa- tients treated in the United States with pa- tients treated in the Province of Manitoba in Canada. The number of casemix and treat- ment characteristics used in this study is more extensive than found in most interna- tional studies. In any comparison of health outcomes and costs based on observational data, un- measured patient or treatment charac- teristics can confound the results. The small impact of adding available covariates to the model (see Table 4) was somewhat surpris- ing. Although other unmeasured covariates may explain the variation in mortality, it im- plies that some of the most obvious health characteristics are not responsible for inter- national differences. Mortality also may be determined by differences in the quality of selection of healthier patients for renal-re- placement care in Manitoba, quality of predialysis care, vascular access manage- ment, or attention to the psychosocial as- pects of care.31 Notably, age and the num- ber of comorbidities in patients in Manitoba were not dissimilar from those of patients in the United States. If deci- sions to deny some patients renal-replace- ment therapy because of comorbid status were responsible for our findings, we would expect to see relative mortality rates between the United States and Manitoba closer to one in young, presumably healthy patients. Instead, the relative mortality rate in such patients was higher than the relative mortality rate in other groups. Moreover, we found that increasing the level of detail in casemix and treatment adjustment actually increased the mortality differential, an effect opposite from what is expected from failure to control for confounding patient charac- teristics. Researchers also have found substantial variation in mortality rates among different US facilities and have reported that differences in facility char- acteristics, such as whether the facility was for-profit and the frequency of physician visits to the facility, partially explain vari- ation in mortality.32 Of interest, a history of hypertension was associated with a decrease in the ad- justed mortality rate, a finding that has been reported previously.33 Although hy- pertension is a predictor of cardiovascular disease in the general population, its role in outcomes of patients with ESRD is less well established and warrants further study.34'35 The Study Evaluated the Only Disease for Which There Exists a Single-Payer System in the United States. End-stage re- nal disease is the only disease for which the US government has a long-standing policy of financing care for almost all patients. Other factors-in particular, the presence of for-profit centers in the United States-may affect decisions about the manner in which patients are treated in the United States, such as the duration of dialysis sessions, the types of membranes that are used for hemodialysis, and the mode of therapy available to patients. We did not attempt, however, to assess whether the profit mo- tive in the setting of a single-payer system affects health outcomes or costs of medical care; that is a subject of other evaluations of ESRD in the United States.36 If all care in the United States were legislated (or evolves) into a single-payer system, such a system would likely arise from the institu- tions already in existence in the United States, including for-profit facilities. Nor is it likely that a single-payer system in the United States would adopt all other institu- tional characteristics of the Canadian-style single-payer system. The ESRD program, therefore, offers a unique case of how an American single-payer system affects health outcomes and costs of medical care. 695 Vol. 35, No. 7</page><page sequence="11">HORNBERGER ET AL Single-payer Systems and Relation- ship to Health Outcomes and Medical Costs. Canada's single-payer system of fi- nancing health care has a number of desir- able features and has influenced health care reform debates in the United States.2'37'38 Each Canadian province assures coverage for the medical care of all patients treated for ESRD. The provincial governments influ- ence medical decisions indirectly by pros- pectively negotiating with provider organi- zations on the annual budget, or "global budget,"the organization will receive to pro- vide medical services for all its patients. Once the budget is set, the provider organi- zations decide how to allocate these funds within their organizations. Patients and phy- sicians, thus, have discretion to consider treatments with little risk of administrative in- terference.3 An explicit, negotiated budget, however, may restrain Canadian physicians from offering or providing costly services of only marginal benefit.3'39 The Health Care Financing Administra- tion, which administers the US program, in- fluences medical decisions indirectly through its ability to set rates on outpatient and inpatient services. As in Canada, indi- vidual-level treatment decisions remain pri- marily at the discretion of the patient and the patient's physician. Our findings suggest that a single-payer system for a defined group of US patients does not assure out- comes like those found in the Canadian- style single-payer system. Some analysts argue that a single-payer system in the United States would reduce administrative inefficiencies associated with a private healthcare sector.1'40 The Health Care Financing Administration reportedly achieves a level of administrative efficiency unequaled in other segments of the US health care system and approaching that found in Canada.41 That Canada experi- enced lower costs suggests, however, that the main difference in expenditures for ESRD patients relates more to differences in how care is provided than in the cost of ad- ministering the program. Patients who de- velop ESRD in Canada are more likely to undergo renal transplantation than US pa- tients with ESRD.22'42 Higher rates of trans- plantation, a less costly ESRD modality than hemodialysis, may partially explain lower ESRD transplant cost in Canada.12 We were unable to isolate the attributes of Canada's health care system that led to better out- comes. Perhaps prospective budgeting for both inpatient and outpatient care in Can- ada (compared with a system in the United States in which inpatient services are not prospectively budgeted) encourages clinical approaches that result in better health out- comes and lower costs. Prospective budget- ing may affect care in the United States by providing the necessary incentives for healthcare organizations to explore strate- gies that improve the accrual of organs for transplantation, improve the care of predia- lysis patients, and more aggressively imple- ment cardiovascular risk-factor interven- tions. If prospective budgeting were the key to Canada's better results, it is a feature that is becoming more common in the United States as competitive pressures promote the adoption of capitation and other features of managed care. 38,43,44 With funding of dem- onstration projects by HCFA to examine the effect of prospective budgeting of ESRD care, much-needed data will be forthcoming on the health and costs effects of such poli- cies on the ESRD population. Concluding Remarks For Americans with ESRD who do not have health insurance or who are at risk of losing their health insurance, the US ESRD Medicare Program has succeeded in assur- ing access to life-prolonging medical care. Our findings suggest, however, that adopt- ing universal coverage under a mandatory federal program cannot by itself guarantee that costs of treating Americans ESRD pa- tients will fall to Canadian levels or that out- comes will be equal or better. 696 MEDICAL CARE</page><page sequence="12">COSTS OF END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE Acknowledgments The authors thank Andres Busette and Lis Coutts for assistance in data analysis and Cathy Piumarta for her help in preparing the manuscript.
