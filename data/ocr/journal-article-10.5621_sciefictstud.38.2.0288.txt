<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 288 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) Thomas Van Parys A Fantastic Voyage into Inner Space: Description in Science- Fiction Novelizations Throughout their history, cinema and television have always had a cross- promotional relationship with literature. Even in our almost post-literate age, a new film is nearly always supported by a tie-in book. And if the film is based on an original screenplay, that book will be a novelization. With industry conglomeration and the advent of the blockbuster since the 1970s, the novelization has been firmly institutionalized as part of a network of merchandise linked to film releases. In addition to providing extra publicity, the novelizations of The Omen (1976, by David Seltzer) and Star Wars (1976, by Alan Dean Foster) showed Hollywood that such books had the potential to be financial successes in their own right. The link between the blockbuster film and its attendant tie-ins has led to a significant rise in novelizations and other spin- off works in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. A number of critics feel that this development has been a blemish on the genre, since general readers hardly make any distinction between literary sf and sf novelizations. Even many new writers, as Christopher Priest (an occasional novelizer himself) has pointed out, now accept as a norm that “selling Star Wars or Star Trek tie-ins is a way in to the writing of legitimate SF,” at a time when “the images and ideas of SF have been comprehensively sold out to commercial interests” (qtd. in Gevers). Many authors and scholars do not regard sf cinema very highly in the first place, claiming it to be ideologically inferior to sf literature. James Gunn, for instance, contends that most sf films, “if translated into written form, would be unpublishable because of lack of logic or originality,” regardless of “the success of the novelized versions of a variety of SF films, including Star Wars and its sequels” (45). In this essay, I would like to take a closer look at the much- despised genre of the sf novelization. Structures of Description in SF Novelizations. Basically, novelization can be defined as the adaptation from film to literature.1 In the narrowest sense of the term, it refers to a novel based on a film—or, more precisely, a novel that is essentially a transcription of the screenplay of a film. Just like “adaptation,” however, novelization should be better understood as an umbrella term, embracing an incredible variety of novels and books, including continuation novelizations (i.e., novels with original stories but based within the world of a given film, such as K.W. Jeter’s “sequels” to Blade Runner [1982]—Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human [1995], Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night [1996], and Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon [2000])—spin-off and crossover novels, literary (highbrow) film novels, “cinéromans,” and so on. Since novelizations can depart from their source texts in very different ways, a typology of novelization would no doubt mirror Thomas Leitch’s mapping of adaptation on </page> <page sequence="2"> DESCRIPTION IN SF NOVELIZATIONS 289 an intertextual slope from direct translation to allusion (see 93-126). While academic research into the novelization and its history is still in its infancy, especially in the Anglophone world, there have been a number of pathbreaking publications in this area.2 Much work has already been done to define and demarcate the relevant critical terrain, mostly by Jan Baetens (see especially “From Screen to Text”). Since the time seems ripe for further exploration, I would like to center this analysis on a specific narratological and theoretical issue: literary description, which seems ideally suited to shed light on the relation of novelization to film.  In classical narratology, description is, along with action and dialogue, one of the three pillars that constitute a narrative. Description is often deemed subordinate to the narrative event, however. Considering that a novelization is in essence “the book of the film,” it might be assumed, at first, that its descriptions correspond with the filmic images. Although it might also be expected that novelizations contain much description, since they presumably “describe” the films they novelize, it has been observed that they in fact include very little. Jan Baetens and Marc Lits observe that the majority of novelizations set small store by description and do not seek to rival the visual richness of the films from which they are derived (13). In the commercial novelization, this visuality is generally toned down; Baetens considers such censorship an “antiliterary intervention,” since the “literary” novel usually includes detailed descriptions (“Novelization” 55). In literary works, the setting, for instance, may be thematized or charged with symbolic meaning, in order to establish mood or atmosphere; in a novelization, by contrast, the emphasis is on dialogue and action. Moreover, the visual descriptions that do end up in the text are anything but central. For their part, Hollywood blockbusters play on the appetite of audiences for the latest spectacular special effects; at the least, they exhibit an expressly cinematic form of visuality. The repression of the visual in their adapted counterparts supports the notion that the novelization is merely intended as a reading companion to the film, a promotional product rather than a novel in its own right. Ultimately, the novelization erases itself in order to “reduce the tension between media and discursive regimes” (Baetens, “Novelization” 50), so that the film can hold center stage. In this essay, I will investigate whether description in the novelization can be seen as the point where film and novel meet—if, in other words, it represents the intersection of the visual and the textual. One of the first critics to minutely examine description in literature was Philippe Hamon, in his article “What is a Description?” (1972). Although Hamon’s structuralist approach is somewhat outdated, he introduces basic textual features relevant to my analysis. According to Hamon, the narrator in realist novels generally permits the characters to take charge of the descriptions through focalization. Hamon suggests three ways in which a character can describe someone or something. First, a character can “look at” an object directly; such descriptions are dependent on the character’s limited vision rather than the narrator’s omniscient knowledge. Second, a character can “speak of” an object to another character who is not familiar with it. Third, a character can </page> <page sequence="3"> 290 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) “act on” an object; in this case, description takes the form of a series of activities. Ultimately, the purpose of these devices is the transmission of descriptive information to the reader. Hamon bases his discussion of the internal structure of descriptions primarily on the distinction between readability (“clichés, words of high frequency”) and unreadability (“available specialized vocabulary”) (Hamon 166). The use of a specialized technical vocabulary leaves open three options in fiction. First, the narrator may omit any explanatory predicates, which stands in contrast to the poetic enumeration of metaphors. Second, the narrator may accept a certain degree of unreadability, adding equally technical predicates, so as to encourage the reader to decode and interpret. Third, the narrator may counter the obscurity of some terminology by means of a sequence of clarifying predicates, which mostly involves “comparison, paraphrase, explanatory apposition and the anthropomorphic metaphor” (Hamon 163). In addition, a description may well be sensual in nature, as opposed to the usual metonymical relations. The description “then takes on a highly personalized appearance; this is the technique of impressionism, and also that which is often used in fantasy, adventure, science fiction, or in the riddle” (166). The narrator has the character express his or her own sensory experience in order to clarify the object of description. Hamon concludes that description in realist discourse first pursues a referential function, based on a “linguistic illusion” (169). As Roland Barthes has argued, the linguistic signs of novelistic description trigger a “reality effect,” in that the textual details become in themselves—in their mundane presence and superfluity—signifiers of reality. The second method to achieve realism is to mask the gap between description and action by incorporating the description into the event itself, often by relying heavily on the gaze of the characters. The sf genre employs these devices to its own advantage. In sf literature, description has two distinct functions. As some critics argue, following Darko Suvin, science fiction is based on the principle of “cognitive estrangement,” a term that refers back to the Russian Formalists’ concept of ostranenie. It is a fiction that defamiliarizes the reader’s experience through the depiction of an alternate world, yet actually re-evaluates the known world in a cognitive way. As is well known, this interaction between alienation and cognition is rooted in a discontinuous point of difference, the “novum,” which is scientifically rationalized and logically developed, “grounded in a discourse of possibility, which is usually science or technology, and which renders the difference a material rather than just a conceptual or imaginative one” (Roberts 7; emphasis in original).3 Much sf adopts a realist mode, since this avoids undermining its potential as an imagined reality (see Roberts 18). The first function of descriptions, then, is to counter the inherent “unreadability” of the novum and to convey a spark of “re-cognition” to the reader. They evoke the “alien” novum, yet include a hint of recognizability, so that the reader can connect to the estranged world represented in the text. Reading sf often involves an elaborate sussing of verbal clues, left for the reader to decipher and decode in order to comprehend the textual world (see Angenot; James 115). Usually, the story features one or more characters equally unfamiliar with the novum, </page> <page sequence="4"> DESCRIPTION IN SF NOVELIZATIONS 291 which facilitates indirect explanations to the reader. Sometimes, though, this results in an “info-dump,” a rather awkward technique involving a character lecturing another character in order to provide background with which the reader is not familiar. This use of characters as tools for the plot has led some critics to argue that the narrative venues of sf stories are the real protagonists, with description often “stand[ing] in for characterization” (Mendlesohn 8). But is all of this applicable to sf novelizations as much as it is to sf literature in general? It could be argued that sf novelizations follow first of all the rules of popular fiction and lack many of the genre-specific elements of sf. Of course, there have been some instances of cross-fertilization, including novelizations written by high-profile sf authors: Theodore Sturgeon’s Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961), Isaac Asimov’s Fantastic Voyage (1966), Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Orson Scott Card’s The Abyss (1989), Christopher Priest’s eXistenZ (1999), and Terry Brooks’s Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (1999).4 In what follows, I will base my discussion on commercial sf novelizations that are more typical of the genre, before moving on to my main case study, Isaac Asimov’s Fantastic Voyage (1966). In particular, I will draw from four novelizations, each from a different decade, namely Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), The Terminator (1984/1985), The X-Files: Fight the Future (1998), and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008).5 Rather than provide an exhaustive discussion and schematization of all facets of description, I will focus on a few striking features.6 Reading a novelization, it becomes immediately clear that the images from the film, with which many readers are quite familiar, are not directly translated onto the page. Depictions are ubiquitous in cinema due to its abundance of iconic signs (in contrast to the non-iconic or symbolic signs in literature); in Seymour Chatman’s words, film “cannot help describing” (Story and Discourse 40; emphasis in original). Since this kind of “tacit” cinematic description is usually not mediated through a character, it might be expected that descriptions in novelizations are often directly related by the narrator. This is not, however, the case; instead, as in much popular fiction, the depictions are transferred to highly focalized descriptions. Two special cases are what I call “self- description” and a kind of “inverted focalization.” In the case of self- description, the author inserts reflective mirrors or photographs in order to sustain focalization. In Shaun Hutson’s novelization of The Terminator, this textual device is used several times: “She ... studied her reflection in the mirror inside the locker” (25); “He looked at himself in the mirror, inspecting first his left then his right profile. The lens burned with that hellish red light” (112). Frakes and Wisher’s authorized novelization of The Terminator expands the description even further: “When she was little, her mother used to tell her she had eyes that would one day drive men crazy. She studied them now. The lower lids drooped slightly.... Sarah smiled to herself, then tossed her head back and tightened her face, studying the effects a few dabs of mascara made” (60). Of course, the reader cannot see the characters as the viewer does on the screen. Hence the narrator, who seems to efface himself as much as possible in </page> <page sequence="5"> 292 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) commercial novelizations (in accordance with common practice in the realist novel), reverts to focalized self-description. The reader views over the character’s shoulder. Another sign of the high degree of focalization in novelizations is the adaptation of the often short descriptive shots in films of a person, object, or narrative event that the protagonist in the scene does not see, notice, or understand. The following examples are from the novelizations of the X-Files films: “Cassidy scrutinized her coolly, but she didn’t take note of the other thing Scully had brought back with her from Texas” (Hand 143); “Had her eyes been on her rearview mirror, she would have seen the bulky figure passing behind her, blushed red in her brake lights, ever so briefly. But she did not” (Collins 2); “Cheryl was unaware that someone was watching her, studying her, an angular-featured, muscular man who swam in parallel to her a lane over, but under water, his long dark hair streaming like seaweed” (Collins 65). In cinema, at least in its conventional narrative form, switching points of view occurs much more surreptitiously than in popular fiction. In the above examples, the descriptions are still achieved through the same character that is being focalized, but through a special instance of what Gérard Genette calls “paralepsis”—i.e., “information in excess of what is called for by the logic of the type [of focalization] selected” (Genette 66). Here the infraction of the type of focalization happens through a momentary inversion of the narrator’s filter: what is described is not what the character sees, but what the character does not see. Furthermore, the conflict between the narrating agent and the focalizing character, and the simultaneous shift from a covert to a more overt narrator, often results in heightened suspense and tension, which in fact mirrors the effect of those brief shots in the films themselves.  In novelizations, most descriptions are not clearly delineated, but incorporated into the narrative, for instance as events, the inner thoughts of characters, even in some cases highly descriptive sentences: “As the Expedition glided in darkness along the country road through a seemingly idyllic snowy vista, dawn turned the horizon pink behind lush firs and naked trees alike, the rest of the sky and the world below washed blue” (Collins 48). Indeed, many theorists have argued that in practice there is seldom a clear distinction between narrative and description. Ruth Ronen claims that this distinction is artificial and purely theoretical, and that there is no such opposition in actual literary texts, for “narrative fulfills a representational function no less often than descriptions impose narrative order” (284). In other words, description needs to be analyzed in relation to its incorporation in the narrative.  While the integration of descriptions into the narrative action appears to underplay the (both tacit and explicit) visuality that is characteristic of cinema, the internal structure of the descriptions in novelizations to some degree counters this tendency. Descriptions are interspersed with comparisons and analogies, and these comparisons are usually explicit similes. This device is often used in sf literature to clarify the novum—i.e., to describe an object the reader is not familiar with using recognizable concepts, as in the following examples from Leslie Waller’s Close Encounters of the Third Kind: “three </page> <page sequence="6"> DESCRIPTION IN SF NOVELIZATIONS 293 sequential directional lights flashing red like a ’71 Cougar” (64); “Some of the objects seemed to have been designed by a cosmic art-deco genius; others looked like flying Christmas trees, coloured lights everywhere” (220); “It was the size of a city, Neary thought. Indianapolis. No, bigger. Detroit. The top of it looked like an oil refinery, with huge tanks and pipes and blazing fires and working lights everywhere” (1978: 224). In fact, these comparisons relate to the imagery evoked in the film. Throughout Hutson’s The Terminator, similar explicit comparisons are used, but they are often more overtly metaphorical in effect: “The night sky was like a piece of soggy velvet, wrung out by giant invisible hands” (16); “Night gathered like some beast of prey waiting to spring. Sarah shuddered slightly as she looked out of the motel window and watched the banks of dark cloud advancing across the horizon like some distant army” (140); “In the blackness, his left eye glowed red, like a pool of boiling blood” (144).  In Frakes and Wisher’s novelization of The Terminator, the similes are equally pervasive. They are often anecdotal, simplistic, and far-fetched: “something erupted into existence with a sound like a gargantuan Mean Joe Green [sic] slamming into the Rocky Mountains” (8); “A nightmare place where machines marked you for easy identification like a can of chili as part of the Final Solution for homo sapiens” (131). Occasionally, the comparisons may also add an extra layer of meaning, however corny, in the form of an explicit interpretation of the events: “For a moment Sarah went weak with disorientation. He was moving like a machine, like a cyborg. He was hiding in the machine from her” (204); “She was moving above him now, hovering like a tender antithesis to the Aerial H-Ks” (204); “It made her feel significant but then insignificant, simultaneously. Almost as if she were a cog, a puppet of fate, a mere link in the causal chain” (237). Similes or comparisons such as these are of course typical of paraliterature as a whole. Nevertheless, their omnipresence in novelizations indicates that they function as a stimulus for visualization, a device that novelizers use to invest their transcripts of the screenplays with their own imagery in order to enhance the reading process and compensate for the missing cinematic visuality. In this way, the novelization is a genre that is simultaneously saturated with and devoid of images. Fantastic Voyage: An Internal Analysis. In Isaac Asimov’s novelization of Fantastic Voyage (1966), description plays a central role: it is not only a textual technique to convey the science-fictional spaces in the story but also an essential means to “characterize” these spaces thematically.7 The story of Fantastic Voyage is a variation on the Vernian voyage extraordinaire, the prototype for the exploration of an alternate world, emphasizing the encounter between the explorer and the fabulous unknown terrain. According to Carl Malmgren, the thematic kernel in such stories is “the relation between Self and Environment” (120)—except here the environment is the “other” within another “self,” for Fantastic Voyage involves the miniaturization of four men and a woman, and their journey into the living body of a man. The setting is almost literally a character, interacting with the travellers as they overcome various hurdles to </page> <page sequence="7"> 294 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) restore the man’s health. Outer space turns into inner space, resulting in the estrangement of the body itself. This particular science-fictional world, which is alien to the reader mainly due to the change in scale, is descriptively “characterized” through various means. For one thing, the descriptions frequently take the form of comparative predicates such as similes: “They’re like soft, squashed balloons that have trapped a millions stars apiece” (80); “They were close enough now to see every detail of the wall. The strands of connective tissue that served as its chief support were like trusses, almost like Gothic arches, yellowish in color and glimmering with a thin layer of what seemed a fatty substance” (85). Such comparisons are instrumental in describing what the inner body and its components look like from such a perspective. The result may even be an increasing technicality (or unreadability) in comparison with the described term itself, as in the following example: “The cells they could see were jagged, uneven, with fibrous dendrites jutting out here and there, like a bramble-bush” (161). Essentially, the comparison or simile is symptomatic of the requirement that descriptions relate the unfamiliar back to the known world. Outside the context of the sf novum, the comparisons are also used as auxiliary support for the reader’s imagination and visualization: “They could see the desk-level banks of monitors, at each of which a technician sat, each in his CMDF uniform, a symphony in zippered white” (42); “It came out of the special release hatch like a cobra coming out of a fakir’s basket at the sound of the pipes” (110); “Cora had been holding on to a projection of the Proteus at the moment the vibration had struck. Instinctively, her grip tightened and for a moment she rode the Proteus as though it were an insanely bucking bronco” (148). While the imagery and choice of words are often simplistic, such comparisons are quite pervasive in novelizations, functioning as anchors for visual effects, analogues of cinematic images. The narrator introduces a protagonist, Grant, who is unfamiliar with the story’s novum (miniaturization) and lacks detailed biological knowledge, thus providing a locus of identification for the reader. Accordingly, Grant is frequently given technical explanations through info-dumps in order to enhance the understanding of the fictional science behind the novum and the defamiliarized world. In general, the descriptions of that world are conveyed through a combination of acting, speaking, and looking. As Seymour Chatman observes, conversations and interactions between characters are created “for the express purpose of describing something, relieving the narrator of the task” (Story and Discourse 74). The travelers not only undertake a journey inside the body, they also “collide” with their environment on multiple occasions in which the sensory experience of the characters is emphasized. Not surprisingly, the gaze is especially important; moreover, it is often psychologically motivated by curiosity, which activates sf’s traditional “sense of wonder.” This gaze is usually supported by transparent milieux or light sources that mediate between the observer and the observed: “Grant glanced out through the observation window to see the usual sight of men and women in white” (22-23); “In the light of its headbeams, dim shapes could be seen through the cells” (102). </page> <page sequence="8"> DESCRIPTION IN SF NOVELIZATIONS 295 Naturally, a reversal of this situation—a lack of transparency—results in imperceptibility: “The light of the miniaturizer had flashed on again after submergence and the fluid all about had turned into a glimmering opaque milk, but nothing followed that could be observed from within the Proteus. If the opacity were spreading out and the ship shrinking further, there was no way of telling” (70). Visibility and transparency become the conditions of the narrative transmission of information.  Even the descriptions of characters in the novel are forced to adopt the same narrative principle: “Her mirror told her, plainly enough, that she was not plain. Quite otherwise” (7); “The gray, featureless screen lit up with his own portrait, full-face and profile, looking—as it always did in Grant’s own eyes—darkly and menacingly gangsterish. Where was the open, frank look?” (22). While there is a certain visuality to this technique that may be viewed as an aping of cinematic images, it also invites a short novelistic contemplation (and even internal characterization) entirely absent from the film. It is also an example of the symptomatic covertness of the narrator: if there is no focalization, there will be no description. Focalization through the characters, again, goes hand in hand with the narrator’s retreat into the background and the incorporation of description into the event. It is Grant who serves as the locus of focalization in the novel and who channels the encounter with the new world. Focalization also fosters a certain degree of subjectivity or modality in descriptions. The narrator often registers the progression of the characters’ thoughts: “In her thoughts she could see, all too clearly, the antibodies coating the bacterial cell, fuzzing it completely, then crushing it as inter-molecular forces drew the antibodies together” (150); “He felt his sense of comprehension and awareness slipping away as the dendrites became clouded over with a milky haze. Milky haze? A white cell!” (173). In Fantastic Voyage, this method is quite suitable to convey to the reader the feeling of miniaturization and how it affects and transforms our perspective on the world.8 The descriptions make it clear that ordinary objects are interpreted differently: “They were men, moving toward them—towers of men in the dim outer light, men foreshortened downward, foreshortened upward, as though viewed in giant distorting mirrors. A belt-buckle was a square of metal, a foot either way. A shoe, far below, might have been a railroad car. A head far above seemed a mountainous nose surrounding the twin tunnels of the nostrils” (64); “The Proteus was suspended over a lake” (66). It is also a way for the narrator to translate the “awe” that viewers of the film are expected to feel (and that the characters in the story experience).  In the next step, finally, subjectivity in descriptions lends itself to the characters’ interpretation of the observed environment: “It was a dance! Each object quivered in its position. The smaller the object, the more pronounced the quiver. It was like a colossal and unruly ballet in which the choreographer had gone mad and the dancers were caught in the grip of an eternally insane tarantella” (81). This metaphor describes how Grant perceives the Brownian motion of molecules after they have entered the bloodstream. In novelizations, the narrator is able to insert personal points of view on events in a literal, verbal manner, in contrast with the film camera, which usually reverts to suggestion </page> <page sequence="9"> 296 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) or voiceover. This last example shows how description is integrated in the narration, tying together focalization, subjectivity, and descriptive comparison. The narrator’s covertness in service of the referential illusion is accompanied by a stimulus for visualization, which underscores both the novum of science fiction and the repressed visuality of the novelization. While many of the above characteristics may hold for much popular fiction, they become particularly significant in sf novelizations, where readers know they are reading books based on films dominated by striking and unusual visual effects. In what follows, I would like to consider how the novelization of Fantastic Voyage compares with the film, and whether or not it truly represses the visual. First of all, it is necessary to take into account how the media themselves—and the respective modes of reception inherent in the viewing and reading experiences—are fundamentally different. Since sf is usually considered a realist genre, it is vital to make the viewer or reader empathically invest in the narrative. According to Jay Bolter and Richard Grusin, film not only emulates but also improves upon the novel because it is mimetically closer to the representation of reality. A film such as Fantastic Voyage, however, must deploy pervasive special effects in order to absorb the viewer into its fictive reality. The filmic image, especially in sf, is very much manipulated. In Fantastic Voyage, the actors do not really swim in bodily fluids, but dangle from wires on elaborate sets, which viewers must deceive themselves into accepting as reality. The film, then, is a kind of meta-representation of a science-fictional world. The novel, on the other hand, is a more straightforward representation of that imaginary reality, since readers can directly enter into the linguistic illusion through their imaginations. This also means that the novel leaves more options open, for instance on the level of futuristic devices such as the “tri-dimensional map” (Asimov 38). The imagination is not hindered by the limits of the technology of the day. Perception is thus decisive for the degree of mimesis. In fact, realism always depends on the code in question: the expression will be accepted as “realistic” if the code is familiar to the viewer and serves the story sufficiently. The linguistic code is different from the cinematic code, however, in that the cinema relies to a larger extent on visual perception. In the end, representation of reality is always an illusion, but perception plays a key role in the viewer’s own construction of and belief in that representation. In the case of Fantastic Voyage, film and novel have their own specific strengths. Overall, the novelization has undergone a substantial number of changes from the screenplay version. Besides additional material, sequences have been swapped around, subplots have been dropped, and conversation partners have been switched. There is a considerable expansion of characterization, especially with regard to the hero’s love interest, Cora. More interesting is the loss of cinematic elements in the descriptions: the film contains strikingly few lines of dialogue, leaving room instead for visual spectacle, whereas the novel concentrates on dialogue and tackles the images in explanatory conversations. The film also has a striking main title sequence, mixing the output and sound of a typewriter with synthesizer bleeps and photographic material. Furthermore, the mysterious territories of the body are </page> <page sequence="10"> DESCRIPTION IN SF NOVELIZATIONS 297 highlighted by Leonard Rosenman’s modernist score; while the first part of the film is unscored, the music begins the moment the crew enters the bloodstream, which reinforces the correspondence between the atonal music and the science- fictional world, alternating as it does between the grotesque and the wonderful. By comparison with the obvious cinematic and visual qualities of the film, there are relatively few distinguishable descriptions in the novelization of Fantastic Voyage, and most instances of the descriptive mode are integrated into the narrative action. Instead, Asimov pays a great deal of attention to the scientific foundations of the story. In light of the difficult relationship between sf literature and sf cinema, the latter of which had largely disregarded the innovations of the former and reverted to pulp styles of the 1950s and 1960s, it is significant that in this case a renowned sf author was brought in to add some prestige to the movie tie-in and thereby to the film itself. Basically, Asimov attempts to upgrade the story to accommodate his interpretation of what science fiction should be. Asimov’s additions, which mainly elaborate the scientific and medical facts, are typical of the scientific positivism of the 1940s Golden Age in which he was nurtured as a writer. In the words of Malmgren, the sf author is free to speculate, to fabulate, to invent. But the discourse of the genre does not grant total license to the fictionist. Once the author has posited the representational discontinuity ..., the discursive rules dictate that the author adhere thereafter to the laws of nature and the assumptions of the scientific method.... Moreover, the SF writer must provide a scientific rationale for the discontinuities that he or she introduces into the fictional world. (9) Asimov grounds miniaturization “in a naturalizing discourse which takes for granted the explicability of the universe” (Malmgren 10). It is Asimov who takes credit for rectifying the infamous scientific error in the film: director Richard Fleischer leaves the deminiaturizing ship behind in the brain, which of course would prove fatal to the patient.  What is more, Asimov’s struggles with the story to get the science straight result in innumerable info-dumps by the scientists. These interpolations seek to heighten the plausibility of the science-fictional novum: “It was not merely radioactivity that had to be sensed, but radioactive particles that had themselves been miniaturized; and that, because of their incredibly tiny, infra-atomic size could pass through any ordinary sensor without affecting it. The particles had, therefore, to pass through a de-miniaturizer first” (75); “We’re miniaturized, with lungs the size of a bacterial fragment. The air on the other side of those membranes is unminiaturized” (106); “It means, yes, the air will go through the snorkel only very slowly unless it is miniaturized.... I can extend the field through the snorkel and miniaturize the air on the other side and suck that through” (111). Such quasi-scientific discourse is very prominent throughout the novel. For instance, the moment the ship enters the bloodstream, the film shows close-ups of the spectators and then pauses to depict the first images of inner space thoroughly and in detail. In the novelization, however, the charts are checked first, and then a short description follows, only to be interrupted by a discussion regarding the validity of perception: “Duval said, ‘The color is not </page> <page sequence="11"> 298 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) quite true. If it were possible to de-miniaturize the light-waves as they leave the ship and miniaturize the returning reflection, we would be far better off. It is important to obtain an accurate reflection.... [T]he work done by Johnson and Antoniani indicates that this might actually be possible” (80).  Ultimately Grant does provide the reader with a few descriptions, though interspersed with biology lessons; in this way, Asimov also adds an extra barrier to Hamon’s presuppositions of transparency:  In here, you are seeing miniaturized light-waves with an equally miniaturized retina and all is well. But when miniaturized light-waves go out there into a less- miniaturized or completely unminiaturized world, they are not easily reflected.... We see only intermittent reflections here and there. Therefore, everything out there seems to flicker to us. (77-78)  In other words, the gaze of the observers is distorted, not in the film, but in the novelization. Visuality and perception are not so much repressed as rectified in the novel. The novel, so to speak, presents itself as a scientific improvement on the film. This is the result of the clash, on the one hand, between the expectations of sf literature and the commercial requirements of film tie-ins and, on the other hand, between the rigorous standards of sf literature and the looser conventions of sf cinema. Thus, not only does this case study foreground the different strengths of the respective media, it also illustrates the discrepancies between media within one genre. These kinds of tensions make the study of adaptation from film to novel illuminating. A Lack of Descriptions? As I have argued, the lack of descriptive passages in novelizations is relative. A novelization retains a complicated relationship with description and visuality. Still, the obvious disproportion between the abundant visuality of the film and the descriptive content of the novelization cannot be evaded. Evidently, the commercial novelization is primarily a form of paraliterature aimed at a wider moviegoing audience, especially teenagers, instead of the smaller niche of sf readers. Description needs to make way for action and dialogue because interrupting the fluency of the action is not customer-friendly. Undoubtedly, an important factor is the hybrid nature of novelization and the ambiguity of what its source text precisely is. Sara Martín Alegre has distinguished between novelizations that merely pad out the bare bones of a screenplay and those for which the existing script is merely a launching pad for a more extensive strategy of literary imagination. Since a novelization is generally based on a script, it lacks a direct supply of descriptive details. In screenplays, descriptions of the setting are rather sparse and schematic, in contrast with the dialogue, which is written in full. As Syd Field says: “Dialogue must communicate information or the facts of your story to the audience. It must move the story forward” (28). Usually, descriptions require more research or background information that is not in the screenplay or film (and which is in any case not relevant for the novelization as a commercial product). Furthermore, screenplays are generally written before location scouting or casting, so that novelizers have seldom seen the film when they are </page> <page sequence="12"> DESCRIPTION IN SF NOVELIZATIONS 299 working on the novelization. The minimal use of descriptions might thus be a way of avoiding too much divergence with the film, which, in contrast to adaptation, is generally not allowed. Most readers do expect to read in the book exactly what they have seen on the screen, just as most directors expect the book to be faithful to the screenplay. Besides these contextual factors, there is also an important medium-specific issue to be taken into account, which I have already touched upon, namely that novelistic description is incongruous with the filmic concurrence of image and story. Intrinsic to the sign system of film is the simultaneity or symbiosis of image and narrative, whereas a novel requires linearity. As Hamon remarks, in a novel, “the story ‘comes to a standstill’, the scenery ‘is foregrounded’” (147). In other words, on the level of description, the novel is less saturated than film (to recall Nelson Goodman’s division of symbolic systems on the basis of levels of saturation). In cinema, story and image are interconnected, but in the novelization, the different components, namely description, action, and dialogue, can be isolated more easily from each other. For instance, it is obviously impossible for the novel to describe all the images in the film. In cinema, as Chatman writes, the “effet de réel is intrinsic to the medium: film cannot avoid a cornucopia of visual details, some of which are inevitably ‘irrelevant’ from the strict plot point of view” (Coming to Terms 40). Even though modern narratives characteristically “tend to avoid barefaced pauses of description..., preferring a dramatic mode” (Chatman, Story and Discourse 74), which leads to an increasing integration of narrative and description, the novelization does not always substitute adequately for the inevitable loss of images (or visual signs) in the transfer from simultaneity to linearity. Is description, then, the intersection where film and “the book of the film” meet? My discussion has emphasized the significance of the perception of the viewer and the reader on both a textual and an intertextual level. On a textual level, the reader already imagines sequences mentally while reading a novel (see Baetens, “Novelization” 57), through what Peter Schwenger calls “literary visualization” (2). As Wolfgang Iser argues, in “reading literary texts, we always have to form mental images, because the ‘schematized aspects’ of the text only offer us knowledge of the conditions under which the imaginary object is to be produced” (137). On the other hand, the reader often “skips descriptions” in novels (Hamon 176, n31), relying on action and dialogue to fill in the disregarded information. Since the film already provides the viewer with images, this double perspective questions the transfer of such visual information to the reader. Specifically, the degree of convergence with the film is determined by the reader, who—more often than not—thinks in terms of comparison. On an intertextual level, the question of whether the reader knows that he or she is reading a novelization then plays a key role.  In contemporary adaptation studies, critics have increasingly attached value to the reception of an adaptation, emphasizing the importance of whether the audience experiences it “as an adaptation” (Hutcheon 120; emphasis in original). The same goes for novelization, especially when considering the publishing practices of film tie-ins. For instance, some have assumed that the </page> <page sequence="13"> 300 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 38 (2011) film Fantastic Voyage is an adaptation of Asimov’s novel, instead of the other way round, because the novelization had in fact been published some time before the film due to the latter’s production problems.9 The reception of adapted novels versus novelizations is thus more problematic than it might seem at first sight, because the book market does not offer a clear distinction between the two; both become the “book of the film.” Nünning draws attention to the interaction between textual data and the reader’s knowledge in the reading process, positing that theories of description should be “reconceptualized in a cognitive and pragmatic framework that takes into consideration both the world- model and knowledge in the mind of the reader and the interplay between textual and extratextual information” (99). In novelizations, description is given an additional third layer, for the cognitive experience of reading a novelization will be profoundly different for those who have seen and those who have not seen the film. All in all, the intertextual knowledge of the reader and the viewer will critically influence the status and reception of a novelization. It is my hope that future explorations into science-fiction novelization, which will undoubtedly cover an amazingly diverse range of topics (including a much-needed detailed typology of the broad corpus of novelizations and spin-offs within the genre), will also consider this vital cognitive side to adaptation.  NOTES 1. Novelizations can be based on various media, such as tv series, videogames, and so on; for the sake of brevity, I will focus primarily on film novelizations. 2. My approach in this essay is primarily text-oriented. For a study more attentive to the authorial and commercial aspects of novelization, consult Larson. A brief survey of sf, fantasy, and horror novelizations can be found in Pringle, and a historical contextualization of the Hollywood novelization in my 2009 essay. 3. Suvin borrows this term from Ernst Bloch; for an excellent critical analysis, see Csicsery-Ronay (49-55).  4. Some of these novels, Clarke’s and Card’s in particular, were developed more or less simultaneously with the respective films. while book-to-film adaptation presupposes anteriority and linearity (often along with hierarchy, unfortunately), novelization does away with any clear temporal distinction, however, since many commercial novelizations are solely based on screenplays and are being written before production on the films is completed. Vonda N. McIntyre, author of several Star Trek novelizations, says: “It takes a lot longer to print and distribute half a million copies of a paperback than it does to edit and copy a film, so the manuscript must be finished before filming is complete” (qtd. in Larson 12-13). From this perspective, Clarke’s and Card’s efforts are primarily different from other novelizations in their collaborative nature, as film and novel have mutually influenced each other in these cases. Clarke, of course, also co-wrote the screenplay for 2001 (with Stanley Kubrick), basing it on an expansion/adaptation of his short story “The Sentinel” (1951); his novelization is thus a particularly complex example of the form.  5. The novelization of Close Encounters of the Third Kind was written not by Steven Spielberg himself, as the cover would have us believe, but by ghostwriter Leslie Waller, a pulp author whose stories usually revolved around the mafia and conspiracy theories and who also wrote the novelizations of the film Dog Day Afternoon (1974) and the tv series Falcon Crest (1984), both under the pseudonym Patrick Mann. Incidentally, in 1980 Spielberg released a Special Edition of the film, which also led to the publication </page> <page sequence="14"> DESCRIPTION IN SF NOVELIZATIONS 301 of an edited version of the original novelization. Remarkably, The Terminator has been novelized twice. One novelization (1984) was done by Shaun Hutson, but his publishers ended up pulling the book because they had not cleared the rights; the other, the authorized novelization (1985), was written by Randall Frakes and William Wisher. The latter was based on a more definitive version of the screenplay. The X-Files, the 1998 film adaptation of the renowned tv series, was novelized by Elizabeth Hand, a noted feminist and sf author. Alongside her “serious” work, however, she regularly writes tie- ins, such as 12 Monkeys (1995) and Anna and the King (1999). The novelization of the sequel, The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008), was written by Max Allan Collins, who has built a reputation as both a mystery author and a novelizer. Co-founder of the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers, he is one of the most prolific tie-in authors of the last two decades, having written the novelizations of Waterworld (1995), Saving Private Ryan (1998), and The Mummy (1999).  6. See Nünning and Wolf for recent examples of such schematization. 7. Isaac Asimov would also publish his own independent, “original” version two decades later as Fantastic Voyage II: Destination Brain (1987), which may be considered a novelization too, in that it is an adaptation of the film in the form of a reworking. Only the basic premise is the same; the characters and situations are entirely different. 8. Similar examples can be found throughout Murray Leinster’s novelizations of the tv series Land of the Giants (1968-1970), whose premise is similar to Fantastic Voyage. 9. A similar case is Delos W. Lovelace’s novelization of King Kong (1932), which appeared the year before the film was released (1933).

It has been argued that novelizations contain a small amount of description, which is remarkable considering the emphasis on visuality characteristic of sf cinema. The essay highlights a few striking features of descriptions in novelizations, with examples taken from the novelizations of Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), The Terminator (1984), The X-Files: Fight the Future (1998), and The X-Files: I Want to Believe (2008). Isaac Asimov’s Fantastic Voyage (1966) is presented as the main case study, for description plays a central role in this novel, not only formally but also thematically. Passages from Asimov’s novelization are positioned against relevant scenes from the film, with a focus not only on the difference between the two media but also the discrepancy between media within the sf genre. Finally, the article attempts to open up the discussion, arguing for contextual and medium-specific factors in the disproportion between the abundant visuality of film and the descriptive content of novelizations, and calling for more attention to the vital cognitive side to adaptation. </page> </plain_text>
