<plain_text><page sequence="1">78 TREE-WORSHIP IN INDIA. By S. M. Edwardes, C.S.I. , C.V.O. The worship of trees is one of the most widespread forms of popular religion in India ; and examples of the reverence paid to them by Hindus of all classes occur in every village, town and city, from the Himalayas to Cape Comorin. According to Sir James Frazer this cult, of which instances or survivals can be found in many countries, arises in the first place from the widespread primitive belief that trees have souls of their own like men, that they feel injuries done to them, that the souls of the dead sometimes animate them, and that the tree is the home of a tree spirit, which gives rain and sunshine, causes crops to grow, makes herds multiply, and blesses women with offspring. Thus, all over India one comes across groves and clumps of trees which are firmly believed to be the abode of spirits, and which no villager will therefore injure or cut down. Sometimes these spirits are regarded as benignant, as, for example, at Rajkot in Kathiawar, where the spirits of a certain group of trees cure children suffering from bronchitis, and are in other ways beneficial to the community. Sometimes they are regarded as the very reverse of benign, like those which inhabit the Odiner Wodier trees planted in the backyard of houses occupied by the Kalians (a caste of thieves) of the Tanjore district of the Madras Presidency. The more malignant of these devils have to be propitiated at least once a year by rites conducted under the trees themselves. The fear inspired by certain trees was brought prominently to my notice in 1903, when I was touring in thè Poona district of the Bombay Presidency. On arriving one morning at a new camping ground, I found that my tents had been pitched under a straggling clump of trees which offered comparatively poor shade, while about four hundred yards away was a splendid pipai (Ficus religiosa) which would have amply protected</page><page sequence="2">TREE-WORSHIP IN INDIA 79 them from the mid-day sun. On inquiring of the servants why they had not chosen the pipai, their spokesman informed me that it was inhabited by a munja (i.e., the ghost of a Brahman boy who had died before being invested with the sacred triple thread), of such fiendish malignancy, that none of them dare venture near the tree. To set up tents and carry out one's daily work underneath it was, in their view, simply asking for trouble ; and though, they added, their sole object in life was to carry out the Sahib's orders, they could not be parties to an act which any self-respecting tree-spirit might reasonably regard as an act of trespass. So my tents remained where they were, and the whole native retinue rejoiced at their escape from unknown calamity. Another belief that the tree embodies or represents a fertilizing spirit is responsible, as Crooke points out in his "Folk-lore of Northern India," for the respect paid in India to memorial trees, round which the people of the village assemble, and which frequently serve as the village-shrine or as the centre of the worship of the village-gods. From prehistoric, times the village pipai (Ficus religiosa) has been the hub of Indian village life ; and in some cases groups of village trees represent the ultimate survivals of a primitive forest, " in which the dispossessed spirits of the jungle find their last and their only resting-place.,, The Indian peasant ascribes the weird sounds of the forest by night to supernatural agency and the mysterious waving of leaves and branches to the mystic powers of the trees. The tree, too, is an emblem of life, for it reproduces itself in some strange fashion with each recurring spring, and if it be an ever- green, it is clearly the possessor of eternal life. Hence comes it, doubtless, that tribes like the Khasis of eastern Bengal lay the bodies of their dead in the hollow trunks of trees, or like the Nagas of Assam, hang them in coffins to the branches. Trees often develop into curious and unusual forms, which compel fear or adoration ; and Crooke quotes from one of the ancient Sanskrit works on Hindu ritual, which expressly declares that trees which have been struck by lightning, or uprooted by inundation, or which grow on a burning-ground or con- secrated site, or which have withered tops, or contain many birds' nests, are to be considered totally unfit for 6</page><page sequence="3">8o EMPIRE FORESTRY the manufacture of bedsteads, as they are inauspicious and certain to bring disease and death. Such being the general attitude of the people toward trees, it is not surprising that Hindus regard the planting of a grove as a work of great religious merit, and that they perform various strange arboreal rites, such as the formal marriage of trees to one another or to the well from which they are watered. General Sir William Sleeman,in his " Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official," published in 1844, mentions that the mango- groves which he visited near Jubbulpore in the Central Provinces had all been married . " Among the Hindus," he writes, "neither the man who plants a grove nor his wife can taste of the fruit till he has married one of the mango-trees to some other tree (usually a tamarind tree) that grows near it in the same grove " ; and he gives an instance of an old villager and his wife who sold all their gold and silver ornaments in order to defray the marriage - expenses of a grove which he had planted a few years previously. It is, perhaps, needless to add that the bulk of the money was spent in providing a feast and presents for the Brahman priests who officiated at the ceremony. Trees of a particular species figure in various primitive ceremonies and festivals, such as the highly indecent pantomime held in honour of Bhudevi Panduga, the earth-goddess, by the Koyis of the Godavari district, which centres round a Terminalia tomentosa tree, or the rites for the pacification of the cholera or small-pox goddess, in which the ceremonial booth is invariably erected under a nim ( Melia azadirachta) tree. The wide prevalence in India of Totemism, which has only been brought to notice during recent years, largely through the researches of certain members of the Indian Civil Service, is another powerful underlying cause of the reverence paid to trees. Everywhere can be found tribes, classes, septs or other social groups, who believe firmly that they are sprung from some object, animal, or tree of a particular species, and who ascribe a sacred character to that animal or tree as their totem. One of the best examples of this form of totemism is the devak or family guardian god of the peasantry of Bombay and Berar. Among the Marathas of the Deccan and allied tribes and castes, this family devak is often the jambul (Eugenia</page><page sequence="4">TREE-WORSHIP IN INDIA 8l jambulatta), the ber ( Zizyphus jujuba ), the mango ( Mangi- fera indica) and the banian {Ficus Bengalensis ), while of specially common occurrence are the Kadamba (Nauclea cadamba ), the rui (Calotropis gigantea ), and the shatni ( Prosopis spicigera). Further south in the thickly-forested Kanara district the same ancient system survives. Divisions of castes or tribes, known as balis, are found, which take their name from the pipai (Ficus religiosa ), the screw-pine (Pandanus odoratissimus ), the plantain (Musa sapientum) and the nagchampa (Mesua ferrea). These eponymous trees the people worship on all solemn occa- sions, such as marriage or the occupation of a new house; they rigidly refrain from cutting or injuring them in any way ; and finally they forbid the intermarriage of persons having the same tree as their totem. Members of the nagchampa (Mesua ferrea) group will not even wear the flower of that tree in their hair. Occasionally one comes across families whose devak or eponymous guardian deity is the sunflower or the tamarind (Tamar- indus indica) ; and while there is no objection to a sun- flower man marrying a tamarind girl, the very strictest embargo is placed upon the union of a couple who both worship one or the other of these plants. The Halepaiks of Kanara, who were once freebooters, but are now peaceful tappers of toddy-trees, are divided into two groups, one dwelling on the coast and taking its name (Tengina) from the coco-nut tree, and the other living in the hills and calling itself Bainu , after the sago-palm. Certain sections of the well-known Komati trading caste of Madras have as totems the tamarind, the tulsi (Ocymum sanctum) and the betel-vine. Moving northwards, wft find the wild Bhil tribes of the Satpura hills, the primitive Gonds, and the Korkus of the Central Provinces, wor- shipping all sorts of trees as their totems. The tribal tree of the Kharwars of Mirzapur is the Kar ama , and nothing will induce them to cut it : the Oraons of Bengal will not eat the leaves of the vad (Ficus indica) ; the Rajputs pay special reverence to the nim tree (Melia azadirachta)9 one of their clans, the Raikwars, being forbidden to use its twigs as tooth cleaning sticks; while the Bansetti Binj- hiyas, who take their name from the bamboo, refuse to touch it even at a wedding. Among some castes the most binding oath they know is that sworn on the leaves of</page><page sequence="5">82 EMPIRE FORESTRY the bel ( Aegle marmelos) : it was this oath which Sumar Singh, the murderer of the Peshwa Narayan Rao, was made to take by Anandibai, the jealous aunt of that unfortunate prince. Examples of this ancient system of tree-totemism can be multiplied from all parts of India ; and it is no exaggeration to say that not only are the forests of India very closely interwoven with the traditions and superstitions of its three hundred million inhabitants, but that between the members of certain well-defined social groups and particular species of trees there also exists an intimate and altogether special relation, which in the religious sphere operates to place them in mystic union with their particular guardian tree, and in the social sphere directs the relations in which men and women shall stand to one another. Thus the lives of man and of the forest are indissolubly bound together. The tree is an ancestor, meet to be worshipped like other more anthropomorphic deities : to the tree the devout Hindu turns on the important occasions of birth and marriage ; and when life has passed, it is the tree which feeds his funeral-pyre. Perhaps the most curious custom which prevails through- out India is the marriage of men and women to trees. The practice is largely followed in the case of girls who are to be dedicated to a life of prostitution, but is frequently resorted to in other circumstances, to which no shadow of disrepute attaches. In the Punjab, for example, a Hindu cannot be legally married a third time. So, if he wishes to take a third wife, he is solemnly married first to a babul (Acacia Arabica) or to the akh plant fAsclepia gigantea), so that the wife he subsequently marries is counted as his fourth, and the evil conse- quences of marrying a third time are thus avoided. The same practice is followed by Brahmans in Madras, who believe that a third marriage is very inauspicious, and that the bride will become a widow. Among various classes of Uriyas in Ganjam a bachelor who wishes to marry a widow, or a widower wishing to remarry, is obliged first to go through the ceremony of marrying a sahada tree ( Streblus asper), which is afterwards cut down. In the Bombay Presidency it is a common custom for a man who has lost two wives to marry a rui ( Calotropis gigantea) before he tempts fortune with a third helpmate ;</page><page sequence="6">TREE-WORSHIP IN INDIA 83 or again, a man whose poverty prevents his marrying a bride in the usual way, is similarly married to a rui and then to a widow ; and as the re-marriage of a widow is, according to orthodox Hindu ideas, one of the most calamitous and undesirable transactions, the wedding of the pauper bridegroom has to be performed at dead of night under an old mango tree. Very often, too, a Hindu bride is discovered by the priests to have been born under inauspicious planets, which may prove harmful to her spouse ; and this danger is averted by marrying her first to a tree and afterwards to the bridegroom. Similarly in Oudh, if the ruling stars of the youth form a more power- ful combination than those of his affianced bride, the difficulty is surmounted by solemnizing a marriage between the girl and a pipai tree (Ficus religiosa). In Bengal, according to Dr. Buchanan, "premature marriage is considered so necessary to Hindu ideas of prosperity that even the unfortunate children who are brought up for prostitution are married with all due ceremony to a plantain tree, before the age when they would be defiled by remaining single." The Rautiyas, a large caste in that province, invariably go through the form of marriage to a mango-tree, before the regular wedding; while among the Kurmis and one branch of the Kols, both aboriginal tribes, the bride and bridegroom are wedded, not to each other, but the bride to a mahua ( Bassia lati/olia), and the groom to a mango. According to Crooke, from whose authoritative work several of the above instances have been taken, every girl of the Newar community, who are agriculturists by profession, is married during childhood to the fruit of the bel (Aegle marmelos), which, after the ceremony, is thrown into some sacred river. When she arrives at puberty a husband is selected for her; but should the marriage prove un- pleasant, she can divorce herself by the simple process of placing a betel-nut under her husband's pillow, and walking off. A Newar woman can never become a widow, as the bel fruit, to which she was first married, is assumed to be always in existence. Among the special castes and classes whose traditional occupation is prostitution, as also among certain other castes like the Billavas or toddy-tappers ot South Kanara, who habitually permit prénuptial infidelity, the tree often</page><page sequence="7">84 EMPIRE FORESTRY plays an important part in the girl's initiation. Readers of this article may remember Rudyard Kipling's story, " On the City Wall," which opens with a description of the courtesan Lalun. " Lalun's real husband, for even ladies of Lalun's profession in the East must have husbands, was a big jujube-tree. Her mamma, who had married a fig tree, spent ten thousand rupees on Lalun's wedding, which was blessed by forty-seven clergymen of mamma's church, and distributed five thousand rupees in charity to the poor." That description, with slight alter- ations, might apply to many women in India who follow the hereditary profession of the courtesan. In western and southern India, where these ancient customs still flourish, it is not always a tree that is chosen as the mock husband : it is very often a dagger, a sword, or even the idol in some popular shrine. But in many cases a pipai , a palas ( Butea frondosa ), a sitanti (Prosopis spicigera ) or some other well known tree figures as the pseudo-bride- groom, marriage with which signifies the girl's permanent inclusion in the ranks of the oldest profession upon earth. What are the precise principles underlying the pseudo- marriage with trees and shrubs, it is not easy to deter- mine. "The popular explanation is that it is intended to avert the curse of widowhood, the tree-husband being always alive ; the woman, even if her husband die, can never be a widow, nor can the parents be liable to the contempt which, according to popular Hindu belief, awaits those who keep a girl who has reached maturity unmarried." Some of the cases, however, which have been quoted seem to suggest that the marriage may be intended to divert to the tree some evil influence which would otherwise attach to the wedded couple. The tree, in fact, acts the part of the scapegoat of the Old Testa- ment, and gathers unto itself the evil influences which threaten the life and happiness of the superstitious Hindu. In conclusion one may enumerate a few of the trees to which special reverence is paid, and which occupy a very prominent place in the folk-lore of India. The pipai (Ficus religiosa) has already been mentioned. It is associated with the three great gods of Hinduism, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva : it is worshipped on every Saturday of the Hindu month Shravan (July-August) ;</page><page sequence="8">TREE-WORSHIP IN INDIA 85 its marriage with the tulsi ( Ocymum sanctum) is strongly recommended ; and its dry twigs must be used to feed the sacred fire. Sir Monier Williams tells a story of certain Banias (Hindus of the trading class) who objected to pipai trees being planted in their bazaar, as they could not carry on their roguery under the shade of so holy a tree. But the story is now regarded as an invention for the special delectation of the confiding European or American globe-trotter. The banyan tree (Ficus indica) represents longevity ; it is believed to be haunted by Vetal, the chief of the ghosts and goblins : women in particular must worship it in the month Jesht (May-June), for it grants long life to husbands and the fulfilment of all wishes ; the celebration of its marriage with durva grass ( Gynodcn dactylon) ensures good fortune and a plentiful progeny. The sal (Shorea robusta) is a very holy tree, much reverenced by the jungle tribes who consider it the abode of spirits. The Bagdi and Bauri tribes of Bengal are married in an arbour made of the branches of the salt after they have first been married to a mahua (Bassia lati/olia). Patches of this tree, accord- ing to Crooke, are often reserved as fragments of the primitive jungle, of which it must have constituted an important part. The shami ( Prosopis spicigera ), known in the Punjab as the jand, is very widely reverenced and in western India is regularly worshipped at the Dasara festival. It is commonly chosen to mark the abode or shelter the shrine of some deity ; rags are dedicated to it as offerings; and it is employed in. the marriage cere- monies of many tribes and castes. Brahmans and others perform rites to it, especially at festivals connected with domestic occurrences, and offerings are made to it by the relatives of persons suffering from small-pox. The mahua (Bassia lati/olia) is one of the main sources whence the Indian jungle-tribes derive their food and intoxicants, and is held in the highest respect by the people of the central Indian highlands. It is the marriage tree of the Kurmis, Lohars, Mahilis, Mundas and Santals of Bengal ; and some of the Gonds of Bengal follow the custom of tying the corpses of adult males by a cord to this tree, previous to burial. The aonla (Emblica officinalis) is another sacred tree, worshipped in the month Kartik (December) and again in Phalgun (Feb-</page><page sequence="9">86 EMPIRE FORESTRY ruary), when prayers are offered to it for the fertility of women, animals and crops. Mention has already been made of the nim (Melia azadirachta), in which the god- lings of disease are supposed to reside and which, like the Norse tree Yggdrasil, is closely connected with the worship of snakes. So great is the power of the nim over spirits and spirit disease that in Bombay, when a woman gives birth to a child, nim leaves are placed at the entrance of the lying-in-room, to ward off evil spirits. The Jogis, a criminal tribe of Madras, reverence it and brand their dogs with a representation of it. The Banjaras or wandering carriers use it as a test of their wives' fidelity. Many other trees of great sanctity might be mentioned, such as the salmali ( Bombax heptaphyllum), the naral or coconut ( Cocos nucífera ), the Khair or mimosa (Acacia catechu ), the apta (Bauhinea tomentosa), the palas or dhak (Butea frondosa) and the ashok (Jonesia asoka), which is supposed to bloom vigorously if kicked by a good- looking young woman. But enough perhaps has been said in illustration of the statement that tree-worship plays an important part in the popular ritual and folk- lore of India. The masses of India have little or no sympathy with the forest policy of the Government or with the plans of expert forest officers for the conserva- tion and regeneration of the country's forests ; and they are disposed to resent the regulations and the prohibi- tions which necessarily form a feature of enlightened forest administration. Yet towards special groups of trees, toward trees of certain distinct and widely-distri- buted species, they cherish an attitude of deep veneration, with which is blended a belief that between the living tree and themselves there is an immemorial bond of mutual protection, to be jealously guarded and con- stantly confirmed by the performance of appropriate ceremonies. Among educated and civilized people of Western lands such sentiments and superstitions now find no echo, save perhaps in the old fairy-tales and legends which they tell to their children.</page></plain_text>
