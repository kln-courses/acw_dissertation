<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pastoralism, Puritanism, Imperialism, Scientism: Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation MICHAEL McKEON Boston University In the following essay I will argue that Andrew Marvell's poetic career has a consistency that belies a venerable assumption regarding both the man and his epoch. To understand either, it has been assumed, we must see them as internally divided: we must sharply distinguish the lyric poet from the satirist, the 'poet' from the 'propagandist', the 'metaphysical' from the 'neoclassical', the revolution from the restoration. Of course the immediate political evidence of such a division is obvious enough. To appreciate the more profound element of continuity, for both Marvell and his age, requires a more unified perspective on seventeenth-century literature and history. This perspective is provided by what I will call 'the problem of mediation'. The utility of this term lies in its relevance to diverse human pursuits that we, unlike Marvell and his contemporaries, are inclined to isolate from one another: religious belief, political theory, historiography, the 'new philos- ophy' of scientific method, and the ongoing experimentation with literary form. To see Marvell's career as a perpetual engagement with diverse reformulations of the problem of mediation permits us to understand it as a complex unity. 'Imperialism' has a double status within this unity. First, much of Marvell's poetry, whether political or pastoral, amatory or devotional, is concerned with the imperialistic and deeply problematic relation between unequal entities: dominant and subordinate nation-states, absolute sov- ereigns and aspiring subjects, improving landlords and exploited tenants, artful technology and natural rusticity, imperious loves and argumentative lovers, diffident souls and disingenuous pleasures. These varied contests, and the particular problems of mediation which they entail, are bound together by the seventeenth-century notion and language of empire. But I also will suggest that the theory of empire itself is in process of transforma- tion during this period. By this means the topic of imperialism will lead us to the more broadly epistemological and historical terrain of the seventeenth- century crisis of secularization.</page><page sequence="2">MICHAEL McKEON 47 This crisis is the enabling precondition for Marvell's most compelling poetic activities, and it too must be understood in the paradoxical terms of the problem of mediation. The idea of secularization may imply a faithful accommodation or translation of the sacred to a profane world, of the past to the present, whereby an essential matter is understood to be preserved within an altered form. But to secularize also may be a process of mistransla- tion in which reformation amounts to deformation, purification to corrup- tion - in which to know and experience the given now amounts to a crudely 'imperialistic' act of comprehension, a swallowing up of sacred truth by a secular reduction of it. As the capacity to be moved by this crucial distinction slowly diminishes, secularization attains the status of a relatively unques- tioned good and the crisis itself begins a gradual but inexorable process of evaporation. The early modern rise of secularizing modes of knowledge and action coincided historically with the emergence of the modern theory and practice of imperialism because the connexion is more than an adventitious metaphor. What is presupposed by both developments is that mediation has ceased to be a problem, that the innate authority and consequence of realms apart from our own, suffused with the power of an ideal otherness but for that very reason infinitely difficult of access, no longer carries conviction. I The modest and traditional pastoral dialogues with which Marvell is thought to have begun his poetic life encapsulate, in miniature, the charac- teristic preoccupations of the career that would follow. They are tentatively Christian pastorals: the central contest between human simplicity and sophistication has already been absorbed within the complicating challenge of Nature by Grace. Innocent shepherds struggle to express their rudiment- ary sense of another world in words that will be comprehensible to this one, and still more innocent shepherdesses persist in comprehending more than they ought. Thus Thyris locates their future Heaven at 'the centre of the soul', but Dorinda prods him into adding details that will naturalize the intuition as a concretely rustic utopia of otium and social levelling. 'Oh sweet! Oh sweet!', she says, How I my future state By silent thinking antedate: I prithee.let us spend our time to come In talking of Elysium.1 Can eternity be anticipated in this temporal fashion? Thyris's hopeful translation ('There always is a rising sun, And day is ever but begun' 1 'A Dialogue between Thyrsis and Dorinda', 1. 27: Andrew Marvell, The Complete Poems, edited by Elizabeth S. Donno (Harmonsworth, 1978).

The Damon of another poem is more cautious. He does not so much decline Clorinda's concretely carnal invitations as suggest their spiritual signification, but with such persistent obliquity that she soon gives up and ingenuously inquires, 'What is't you mean?' ('Clorinda and Damon', 1. I6). Damon can offer no more than that he has changed; that 'The other day Pan met me'; that Pan spoke 'Words that transcend poor shepherds' skill' but fill his thoughts and inspire all of nature (11. 19, 21). To sing Pan's praises is a project that Clorinda can understand, but for that very reason we must be left in some doubt as tojust what has changed, what new truths have been communicated. What is Pan to Christ? What is Nature to Grace? What is the letter to the spirit? What is Art to Nature? The problem entailed in the condition that we are able to know what is unknown only by comprehending it within the terms of the known is a venerable one that Christian thought only served to enrich.2 The delicacy of Marvell's early dialogues, written probably in the I640s, consists in their capacity to dramatize this central paradox of Christian pedagogy in such a way that the likely failure to accommodate Christ's truth, within these fictions, only serves to accommodate the paradox itself to other realms of human thought and activity. Marvell's most brilliantly concise access to the paradox of Christian knowledge is 'The Coronet', a palinode whose consummate circuity seems only to replace in form what it retracts in substance. This is not the case in his best-known religious dialogue, for example, where the Resolved Soul is successful in employing the language of martial and material combat, like St Paul, to spiritual ends. Created Pleasure's counter-strategy there is to clothe the fallen delights of Nature with the deceptive language of Grace: Lay aside that warlike crest, And of Nature's banquet share: Where the souls of fruits and flowers Stand prepared to heighten yours. ('A Dialogue, between the Resolved Soul and Created Pleasure', 1. I3) The Soul easily resists these pastoral snares, however, by recognizing the spiritual figure as no more than that, and only then proceeding to translate its sensuous materiality into a figure for truly spiritual nourishment: 2 See, for example, St Augustine, On Christian Doctrine, I. vi: 'Have we spoken or announced anything worthy of God? Rather I feel that I have done nothing but wish to speak: if I have spoken, I have not said what I wished to say. Whence do I know this, except because God is ineffable? If what I said were ineffable, it would not be said. And for this reason God should not be said to be ineffable, for when this is said something is said. And a contradiction in terms is created, since if that is ineffable which cannot be spoken, then that is not ineffable which can be called ineffable. This contradiction is to be passed over in silence rather than resolved verbally' (translated by D. W. Robertson, Jr (Indianapolis, 1958), pp. Io-I1).</page><page sequence="4">MICHAEL McKEON 49 I sup above, and cannot stay To bait so long upon the way. (1. '7) But in 'The Coronet' this resort to translation has become problematic largely because the general strategy upon which it depends, the artful medium of figurative language, now constitutes the principal target under attack. The ostensible aim of retraction assumes the possibility of an artless devotional style, or of an art whose concrete figures accommodate us, like the Resolved Soul's martial habit, to immaterial truths. Yet Marvell's pastoral poems, once embraced as a natural alternative to artifice, must now appear an artful avoidance of Christian humility. However much it is renounced, moreover, pastoral art provides the self-regarding motive and the rhetorical flowers ('my fruits are only flowers' (1. 6)) from which the putatively sacred alternative will be fashioned. This very recogniton Marvell incorporates explicitly within his poem, and it is confirmed both by the unavoidable positing of pastoral matter here even if only to the end of its own negation, and by the tangled syntactical growth which snares the poet and belies the false humility of a paradoxically 'natural art'. Here the act of translation, the use of corrupt language and motives to purify themselves, appears doomed to failure. By calling upon the mediator Christ to disentangle or to destroy his labour, the poet in the end regretfully renounces his own capacity not simply to mediate the gulf between matter and spirit, but even to assign a significance to the present poem, to tell whether it is pastoral or anti- pastoral. At this point, of course, as the power to discriminate is allowed to be Christ's alone and the poet lapses into silence, Marvell may be said at last to enact that genuine renunciation which escaped him so long as the poem's mediating creativity challenged the authority of divine creation. One is tempted to see 'The Coronet' not simply as a Christian but as a Puritan poem, for its exquisite sensitivity to the way human figuration conveys us to error under the guise of truth goes beyond the general paradox of Christian knowledge to what might be seen as a more particularly Puritan problem of mediation. The seventeenth-century attack upon Roman Catholic and Anglican institutions, ceremonies, and images was fuelled by an iconoclastic animus against what Puritans took to be the careless and complacent ease of the orthodox translation from sin to salvation, from works to grace. For episcopal and priestly mediation, Lutheran Puritanism substituted the immediate and personal priesthood of all believers and Scripture readers. For the personal efficacy of good works, Calvinist Puritanism substituted justification by faith: the belief that salvation is to be neither earned nor won by the sinner's own worldly exertions, but can only be received as a gift of Christ's imputed righteousness. Here we must be reminded of the dilemma of 'The Coronet'. The repudiation of all mediators but Christ himself promises to preclude the reduction of spirit to the corrupt standards of</page><page sequence="5">50 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation material approximations; but who then is authorized to know Christ's will, as it were, immediately? The abolition of intervening steps only leaves the single great step, from divine to human knowledge, untaken. In Puritan teachings this gap was filled to a large degree by the system of discipline in the calling, whereby 'good works' (devotional poetry?) may return not as the means by which grace is won but as the visible signifier that grace (the prior and unearned signified) has indeed been given. The reading of individual experience, like the interpretation of the Bible, has become an exercise in the discovery of preordained but personally significant meaning. In other words, it is not so much that dependence on fallible human mediators has been obviated, as that the power and burden of mediation have passed from the political authority of the church hierarchy to the community of believers and to the individual Puritan conscience. As Max Weber's famous and controversial thesis suggests, the historical proximity of Puritan discipline and capitalist industry may lead us to infer the treacherous ease with which signifiers can be transformed into signifieds, material success into the very substance of spiritual fulfilment. To find a professing Puritan willing to subscribe to this thoroughly secularizing transformation is another matter, for it only recapitulates, with greater finality, the orthodox error of human sufficiency against which the incono- clastic impulse of Puritanism was originally directed. As evidence that Puritanism leads to capitalism 'The Coronet' is of no utility. But Marvell's poem vindicates the more general and tentative concerns of Weber's thesis as it reveals Protestant casuistry to be a singularly ambiguous protest against the secularizing tendencies of modern orthodoxy. For in its single- minded devotion to reform - to rationalize and personalize - religious authority, conscientious introspection aggravates the old and deadly desire to become, as if by default, one's own mediator, and elevates the threat of secularization to a more volatile level of consciousness and debate. The precariousness of things in 'The Coronet' is reflected in the indeter- minacy not only of the poet's spiritual status but also of the poem's generic identity. Several related questions are raised. Can the pastoral contest of Art and Nature usefully accommodate to us the Christian one of Nature and Grace, or does the former amount to no more than a skirmish over territory which, from the perspective of the latter confrontation, has long since fallen to the enemy? Does the heuristic adequation of Pan to Christ lead us to Christian truth or confirm us in pagan error? What are we to make of an anti-pastoral whose (pastoral, poetic, linguistic) flowers, invoked only to be renounced, so thrive and luxuriate in the pruning as to be indispensable to the life of the sober structure whose purpose is to kill them off? Although specifically religious in nature, these questions also suggest more general problems of the meaning and persistence of human forms and institutions over time. By exploiting the conjunction of Puritan historiogra- phy with the allegorical resonances of the pastoral mode, Marvell developed</page><page sequence="6">MICHAEL McKEON 51 that highly characteristic style whereby his subjects are saturated with the suggestive aura and immanence of English politics and sacred history. This is less a 'poetic technique' than a delicately provisional world view. Like Clorinda, modern critics tend to ask of these poems, 'What is't you mean?', surely the necessary question so long as it does not seem to require as a response a definitive and irreversible translation from signifier to signified.3 Marvell's turn to a more explicit engagement with politics in the i65os only expands the territory within which the problem of mediation may continue to be addressed. And as before, the central questions concern the workings of what is now conceived as a specifically historical process of translation. What precedents may be available for authenticating the apparently unprecedented events of the English revolution? How amenable are those events to the traditional rhetorical figure of the translatio imperii? II In I65o Marvell composed the 'Horatian Ode' on Cromwell and entered the service of Thomas Fairfax, newly retired Commander in Chief of the republican forces. Cromwell now leads the New Model Army, which he had been so instrumental in modelling upon the principles not of feudal and chivalric service, but of Puritan discipline and the career open to talents. His success is announced in a Roman ode that is replete with the modern statecraft of that most enthusiastic admirer of Roman exempla, Machiavelli, and pointed everywhere to suggest (but not to prophesy) the imminent transformation of the English republic into a renovated Roman Empire. But Cromwell's Vulcanian valour is a decidedly innovative capacity To ruin the great work of time, And cast the kingdoms old Into another mould. (1.34) And the poet's obligatory song of 'ancient rights' therefore must be equivo- cal: Though justice against fate complain, And plead the ancient rights in vain: But those do hold or break As men are strong or weak. (1. 37) The boldness of Marvell's ode may of course be appreciated on many levels. During these critical years, English revolutionaries of diverse political and religious hues were concerned to validate their acquired power through SThe most controversial of Marvell's poems in this respect has been 'The Nymph Complaining for the Death of Her Fawn'; other important instances are 'The Picture of Little T.C. in a Prospect of Flowers' and Upon Appleton House.</page><page sequence="7">52 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation the common lawyers' language of ancient rights and fundamental law even as they also sought a theory of sovereignty (the universal rights of man?) that would not be tied so severely to the argument from precedent or to the monarchal past.4 Marvell's tacit Roman translatio thus counters the realpoli- tik of the last-quoted lines, but the theory of sovereignty with which he flirts depends less on the vision of the Levellers than on that of the Puritan God, who on occasion will enter directly the drama of human history in order to achieve his ends. The equilibrium of Marvell's perspective here seems to be expressed in the alternation between 'heaven' and 'fate', a movement which defines what might be called the political dimension of the problem of mediation. Hebraic thought bequeathed to Puritanism this notion of a God who mediates heaven to earth not just through the epochal Coming of his son, but through the perpetual intrusions of the divine will into the course of history. Cromwell's promise, still muted for Marvell in I65o, is that of one whose talent, formerly lodged with him in pastoral privacy, God now summons into irresistible activity. But as in 'The Coronet', the danger is that the enticingly material means of mediation deform and corrupt its spiritual ends, that to fight and kill for the Prince of Peace is really to fight for Satan. The balance (or 'detachment', or 'ambivalence', or 'irony') which all readers recognize in the 'Horatian Ode' thus appears to express an extension of the epistemological problem of mediation to the sphere of politics and history. And here, as so often, Marvell uses the pastoral choice (contempla- tion vs. action, privacy vs. publicity) to weight the balance evenly. In life and in art, the choice now becomes personalized as 'Fairfax vs. Cromwell', and Marvell spends the next few years first as tutor of the former's daughter, then as tutor of the latter's ward. Yet his deep commitment to both men renders the choice, thus personalized, an untenable one. In retirement at Nun Appleton, Fairfax encloses the great world within his microcosm, and the civil wars themselves are internalized through Marvell's enchanted figures of fort-like gardens, soldierly gardeners, drummer bees, flowery artillery, and starry patrols (Upon Appleton House, Stanzas, 36-43). The enchantment is not to be dismissed as an illusion. The little world here recreated is closer to our first world (the Garden of Eden, the garden ofprelapsarian England) than is Cromwell's revolutionary England, where death and its instruments have unhappily acquired an autonomous significance: Unhappy! shall we never more That sweet militia restore, When gardens only had their towers, And all the garrisons were flowers, When roses only arms might bear, And men did rosy garlands wear? (Stanza 42, 1. 329) 4 See the discussion of Christopher Hill, The Century of Revolution, 1603-z714 (New York, 1966), pp. 6o-68; The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the English Revolution (New York, 1973), Chapter I2.</page><page sequence="8">MICHAEL McKEON 53 Before the Fall, Marvell seems to suggest, the martial arts of death were no more than metaphorical expressions for various aspects of what was in fact eternal life; the Fall has transformed these signifiers into signifieds. Yet this is surely a perverse way to characterize an existence distinguished by the very absence of figuration, doubling, and division, by the unitary reference of human language; and it is a likely irony on Marvell's part that the only way he can express his subject here is by a duplicity of language that accommo- dates the garden to us by attributing to it precisely what it lacks. Fairfax's private imperium now flourishes as England's empire might have done under his martial horticulture (Stanza 44), and the metaphor asserts both similar- ity and difference. For the talent of Fairfax has been to 'ambition weed, but conscience till' (1. 354), an act of Puritan casuistry quite compatible with public effort, but formulated here so as to define an individual rather than a collective discipline and to evoke Fairfax's private doubts about the spiritual efficacy of 'thorough reformation' and regicide. From this perspective, the ends may be corrupted by the means, and so Fairfax's enchanted garden restores warfare to the figurative role that it has exceeded in the public world of contemporary England. Cromwell's equally plausible alternative, chronicled in the three poems of I65O, 1655, and 1658, begins from the assumption that the things of this world may conduct us, through the grace of God, to the next. Already in the 'Horatian Ode', both the promise and the liabilities of the Cromwellian strategy are raised pointedly through the topic of empire. Cromwell has just returned from the brutal suppression of the rebellious Irish, who now 'can affirm his praises best' ('An Horatian Ode', 1. 77). The temptation to irony depends upon a perceived assimilation of ends to means, of right to might. But for this reason Marvell follows it immediately with the figure of the falcon and with the argument that here and in imperial acquisitions to come, Cromwell is himself only the instrument of a higher authority that is implicitly divine and explicitly republican: He to the Commons' feet presents A kingdom, for his first year's rents. (1. 85) In traditional schemes of sovereignty, magistrates have had exclusive access to the arcana imperii, 'reasons' or 'mysteries of state' which transcend the interests and understanding of the individual subject. The experience of the English revolution contributed to the modern discovery that the public interest was not so much a sempiternal and transcendent mystery, adminis- tered by a succession of monarchal interpreters, as the pragmatic sum and interaction of all private interests within a given political and geographical arena.s Some of the problems explicitly associated with the traditional s See J. A. W. Gunn, Politics and the Public Interest in the Seventeenth Century (London, I969).</page><page sequence="9">54 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation model of sovereignty are already familiar to us as problems of mediation, between timeless and time-bound institutions, between the 'political' body of monarchy and its successive, 'natural' incarnations.6 Modern political theory might be said to begin when sovereignty is understood not as a relationship of 'mediation' (of sacred authority to profane vessels, of prec- edent authority to present institutions) but as one of pragmatic, of democra- tic or despotic, 'representation'. This is also one precondition for the modern transformation of 'empire' from a synonym for far-flung 'sovereignty' to a technical term denoting the socio-economic world-system of colonialism. The change may be seen as well in the outdating of the traditional figure of the translatio imperii. The translatio conceives of 'empire' as 'sovereignty', as a static and integral entity that is translated westward from realm to realm and from culture to culture. The great question here is whether each new vessel of empire is truly fit to accommodate it: whether the succession in fact entails a degeneration from a Golden to an Iron Age, a deformation of empire by an attempted comprehension of it within a stunted frame. As empire is slowly brought down to earth and to the immediate contexts of social interaction, it begins to dissolve as a suprahistorical entity, and the argument of its 'translation' loses not only its force but its very meaning. One result is that henceforth the easy justification of power by reference to invisibles will be viewed with increasing scepticism. A less benign result is that imperialism has lost the most powerful, because transcendental, con- straint upon it: the humility attendant upon the belief that all human knowledge and action is profoundly vulnerable because merely creatural, suffered by an indulgent Creator through whose will alone the miraculous mediation of authority may be accomplished. This leap, from traditional to modern imperialism, is evidently related to the putative transformation from the 'Protestant ethic' to the 'spirit of capitalism', for both entail the comprehensive internalization of authority which, however problematic, has been acknowledged to rest until now with a transcendent power. But what I am calling here the 'leap' taken by seventeenth-century thought may then be seen as the critical juncture at which the ongoing problem of secularization, primed by fundamental changes in material and social life, with a desperate grinding of gears shifts its terms and defines itself anew for the modern age. Henceforth human knowledge and power will be con- strained only by the limits which self-conscious humanity, the signifier turned signified, itself undertakes to generate.' For these reasons Cromwell's posture in the 'Horatian Ode' has a compounded equilibrium. He is 6 See Ernst H. Kantorowicz, 'Mysteries of State: An Absolutist Concept and its Late Medieval Origins', Selected Studies (Locust Valley, New York, 1965), PP. 381-98. 7 Compare R. H. Tawney, Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (New York, 1926; 1958), pp. 152-53: 'The law of nature had been invoked by medieval writers as a moral restraint upon economic self-interest. By the seventeenth century, a significant revolution had taken place. "Nature" had come to connote, not divine ordinance, but human appetites, and natural rights were invoked by the individualism of the age as a reason why self-interest should be given free play.'</page><page sequence="10">MICHAEL McKEON 55 balanced not only between a faithful and a deforming mediation of sov- ereignty, but also between these traditional terms of the problem of media- tion and the modern 'Machiavellian' pragmatics of representation. In the later poems Marvell's hard-won trust of Cromwell will be registered by his legitimation according to the traditional scheme, as a successful secularizer of precedent and transcendent authority, while his enemies are invalidated either traditionally, as failed mediators, or as the thoroughly modern proponents of human autonomy and freedom. III During the 165os the type of inimical modernity is the United Provinces of the Netherlands, nurse of economic and religious liberalism. In The Character of Holland (1653?), Marvell makes a complicated use of the translatio which seems to express, among other things, both an ease with the figure's traditionalism and regret and its shipwreck on the shoals of an alien world view: Sure when religion did itself embark, And from the East would Westward steer its ark, It struck, and splitting on this unknown ground, Each one thence pillaged the first piece he found: Hence Amsterdam, Turk-Christian-Pagan-Jew, Staple of sects and mint of schism grew, That bank of conscience, where not one so strange Opinion but finds credit, and exchange. (1. 67) Like everyone else at this time, Marvell knows to associate freedom of trade and freedom of conscience. In both spheres, what has replaced the orderly translation of acknowledged authority is the capitalist system of commodity- exchange, wherein all things are confounded by being equalized on the market of abstract exchange-value. The profound problem of mediation (how to accommodate spirit to matter?) has been decisively secularized as the cheerful challenge of the marketplace (how to transform use-value into exchange-value?). When the translatio ceases to be steered by unchanging principle it becomes lawless and self-interested 'pillage'. In the traditional exchange of commodities, for example, the system of exchange is tempo- rarily serviceable as a means of facilitating the end of acquiring and consuming goods (I trade with you because you have something I need). The attainment of the end coincides with the repudiation of the means. In its capitalist development, exchange becomes a permanent end in itself, and the homogenization of use-values as abstract exchange-value is guided not at all by the law of consumption, not by the determinate need for particular goods, but by the licence to generate endless profit." 8 My language here is borrowed from Marx's comparison of simple commodity production and capitalist production: Capital (New York, 1867; 1967), I. 2. iv, pp. 146-55. 5</page><page sequence="11">56 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation It is this understanding, if not in these terms, that informs Marvell's economic figure for religious toleration in this passage. Thus, by the same token, a limited and thoughtful indulgence of tender consciences would seek to satisfy the particular institutional requirements of different sects to the great end of right worship and salvation. But in Dutch toleration the spiritual ends of indulgence have been replaced by the sheer will to indulge. If no faith is beyond credit then no faith may be credited: all are reduced (or abstracted) to the same equality, which depends strictly on an indifference to substantive spiritual considerations. The medium of exchange with which Marvell and England are concerned in The Character of Holland is not only money but the seas themselves, for the commercial dominance of the Dutch in the early seventeenth century depended greatly on their adherence to the Grotian doctrine of Mare liberum, and to its insistence that nationalist doctrines of territorial sovereignty did not extend to the seas or hence to their mercantile exploitation by enterpris- ing competitors.9 So it is nature itself that seemed to be expropriated from its 'natural' and immemorial rulers, and in his attack on this enemy which impudently neglects even to salute English ships in their own waters, Marvell is content to argue on traditionalistic grounds which at other times would seem to him distinctly problematic: No, but all ancient rights and leagues must vail Rather than to the English strike their sail. (1. 107) In short, no force restrains the unprincipled omnivorous imperialism of the Dutch - except of course for Cromwell. Central to any enlightened defence of Cromwell's foreign policy during the I65os was the view that England's commercial success was inseparable from her championing of the inter- national Protestant Cause against the imperialist aspirations of Roman Catholicism. Rivalry with the Protestant Provinces interfered seriously with this claim, of course, but Cromwell's policy might yet be seen as a successful reconciliation of economic with religious interest, whereas the rapacious Dutch comprehension of 'spirit' within 'matter' was clear (as we have seen) in her indiscriminate toleration of all trading heterodoxy. To be sure, Cromwell's own policy of toleration (and in particular his campaign to readmit the Jews to England in 1655) might be taken to close the gap between Dutch heterodoxy and English orthodoxy, but the return of the Jews at this time was seen by many sympathetic Protestants to have not simply 'spiritual' but millenarian and eschatological import. 10 Marvell himself had become deeply receptive to the view that Cromwell's imperial achievements were an act of Puritan discipline inscribed upon the 9 For direct allusion to the doctrine and to its propounder see lines 26, I13.

The First Anniversary (1655) situates Crom- well at stage centre of international Protestant politics, uncomprehendingly observed by an audience of dull and 'heavy monarchs' (1. 15) whose narrow arcana imperii ignore the imminence of the truly imperial eschatological moment: How might they under such a captain raise The great designs kept for the latter days! But mad with reason (so miscalled) of state They know them not, and what they know not, hate. Hence still they sing hosanna to the whore, And her, whom they should massacre, adore. (1. 109) The dangerous equilibrium of the Machiavellian prince now sounds more like the ideal mediation of the Socratic philosopher king ('Hence oft I think if in some happy hour High grace should meet in one with highest power' (1. 131)), but the model for this mediating power is not of course Platonic philosophy but Puritan messianism. Throughout The First Anniversary, Cromwell's sovereignty is confirmed not only by his translation of Roman auctoritas, but also by his typological fulfilment of Old Testament kingship, an act of successful 'secularization' (the term now sounds paradoxical) that does not simply preserve what has been given but transvalues it from shadowy type to truth, from preparation to actuality. 'If these the times, then this must be the man' (1. 144): Cromwell's messianic mediation of earthly means to heavenly ends distin- guishes him not only from the self-absorbed 'heavy monarchs' but also from his correligionists (Fifth Monarchy Men, Quakers, Ranters, Anabaptists, Adamites) whom Marvell is willing now to see as taking the discipline of iconoclasm so far that it deforms the sacred truths which it was meant to purify: You who the scripture and the laws deface With the same liberty as points and lace; Oh race most hypocritically strict! (1. 315) Now all Puritan sectarians may be homogenized into the same stew of error, joining with Dutch capitalists in the principled espousal of an antinomian 'liberty' which, becoming unlimited, also becomes unprincipled. The poem concludes, in contrast, with that increasingly familiar vision of the later seventeenth century, the apocalyptic yet supremely worldly imperialism of the burgeoning mercantile state. In Marvell's version, the delicate balance of matter and spirit is substantiated by other evidences of Cromwell's mediating capacity, which recall the problematic formulations of the 'Hora- tian Ode' even as they intimate that the problem of sovereignty has dissolved:</page><page sequence="13">58 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation He seems a king by long succession born, And yet the same to be a king does scorn. Abroad a king he seems, and something more, At home a subject on the equal floor. (1. 387) The apotheosis of Cromwell's powers of mediation comes, for Marvell, only with the necessary recording of his death and the disconcerting acknowledgement of his uniqueness (A Poem upon the Death of His Late Highness the Lord Protector ( 1658) ). What Fairfax attains in his private garden, Cromwell, obliged by 'angry heaven' ('Horatian Ode', 1. 26; Upon the Death, 1. 16) to forsake his own preferred retreat, has achieved in the public garden of the world: What man was ever so in heaven obeyed Since the commanded sun o'er Gibeon stayed? ... Who planted England on the Flandric shore, And stretched our frontier to the Indian ore ... He first put arms into Religion's hand, And timorous Conscience unto Courage manned. (11. 191-92, 173-74, I79-80) Cromwell's life has been a unity, a successful materialization of spiritual ends in the treacherous media of space and time and human ambition, a comprehensible translation of transcendence into the fallen language of immanence. Now he 'reigns' and 'pitches' and 'plunges' in heaven, Marvell fancifully tells us, like a frolicking falcon; now he may find and greet those Old Testament kings by whom he was prefigured (11. 287-95). Through these self-conscious figures the poet freely confesses his own incapacity to attain that mastery of mediation which Cromwell's career achieved and of which his death deprives us: And in those joys dost spend the endless day, Which in expressing we ourselves betray. For we, since thou art gone, with heavy doom, Wander like ghosts about thy loved tomb; And lost in tears, have neither sight nor mind To guide us upward through this region blind. (1. 297) On one other occasion, in praise of Paradise Lost, Marvell is moved to a similar gesture of profound humility, now in deference to the great Puritan poet of whose ambition to accommodate heaven to earth and 'ruin the great work of time', like Cromwell's, Marvell had early misgivings: the argument Held me a while, misdoubting his intent That he would ruin (for I saw him strong) The sacred truths to fable and old song,... Lest he perplexed the things he would explain, And what was easy he should render vain. ('On Mr Milton's "Paradise Lost"' (1674), 11. 5-8, 15-16)</page><page sequence="14">MICHAEL McKEON 59 Here, too, the early fears prove groundless: 'And things divine thou treat'st of in such state I As them preserves, and thee, inviolate' (1. 33), a truth which simultaneously elevates Milton to the status of first of poets and raises the Cromwellian question of who shall follow in his footsteps. Thus Marvell's own tacit and tentative imitation of Miltonic periods in the first five lines of the poem is soon put in its place by the observation 'that no room is here for writers left, I But to detect their ignorance or theft' (1. 29).11 IV The problem of empire and of imperialist comprehension, although raised explicitly by the achievements of Oliver Cromwell in the I650s, is subtly implicated within Marvell's first experiments at pastoralism and the para- dox of Christian knowledge. Created Pleasure tempts the Resolved Soul as if it were Eve in the Garden: Thou shalt know each hidden cause; And see the future time: Try what depth the centre draws; And then to heaven climb. ('A Dialogue', 1. 69) The Original Sin of curiosity, libido sciendi, undergoes its own secularization in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century, and the profound ambiguity of this return (the Fall compounded or indemnified?) suffuses the movement from its inception. Francis Bacon is characteristically confident: 'Only let the human race recover that right of nature which belongs to it by divine bequest, and let power be given it: the exercise thereof will be governed by sound reason and true religion.'12 The Baconian promise is of a method of reading God's Nature as Cromwell reads his History. Both are energetically active modes of knowing God through his works, and of learning thereby how to manipulate material reality in simultaneous accord with divine will and practical human benefit. From this perspective the new philosophy is not an instance of, but a response to, the corruption of knowledge at the Fall, and it promises, like Puritanism, to liberate the tradition from the duplicity of false (Aristotelian, ecclesiastical) and deform- ing mediations. When Marvell's enclosed gardens seem relatively successful in accommo- dating the divine plan to us, they may well suggest some of the disciplined but hearty sweat of Puritan industry and Baconian technology. Thus the 11 Thus too Marvell praises Milton's abjuration of rhyme so as self-consciously to admit that his own use of this fashionable means of making his 'sense secure' (1. 46) only subverts the end it was meant to serve: 'I too, transported by the mode, offend, I And while I meant to praise thee must commend' (1. 51; Marvell's emphasis). With the image of Cromwell's survivors left to grope blindly in search of heaven (Upon the Death, 11. 301-02), compare Paradise Lost, ii, 968-1055 and in, 1-56, where Satan and Milton respectively invoke their several 'muses' to guide them up through darkness into light. 12 The New Organon (1620), Francis Bacon: A Selection of His Works, edited by Sidney Warhaft (New York, 1965), P. 374.</page><page sequence="15">60 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation 'warlike studies' and elaborate martial figures of Fairfax, soldier-turned- gardener (Upon Appleton House, Stanza 36). Thus too the 'skilful gardener' of 'The Garden', whose mechanization of nature transforms it into its own sundial, the better to record the fruitful labours in which we and nature now cheerfully participate: 'And, as it works, the industrious bee I Computes its time as well as we' (1. 69). The pun on 'thyme', like the making of the garden into a 'dial new', seems in this context a quite harmless, if inevitable, duplicity. These gardens, though undeniably artful, are distinctly associated with Eden and so enjoy the aura of God's art 'now' recreated in the sempiternal present of pastoral retirement. But when science and technology make a more explicit appearance in the garden they transform it into a sewer of corruption, the concrete and modern aggravation of our original Fall into human sufficiency. The central and extraordinary text here is, of course, 'The Mower against Gardens'. Here gardening is an imperialist takeover: the artful mediation of nature succeeds not in accommodation but in rapacious seduction: Luxurious man, to bring his vice in use, Did after him the world seduce. (1. I) Technological experiments, agrarian 'improvements', the opening up of new markets, and the fabrication of new commodities - all these are part of the rape of nature which consists simultaneously in the debasement of natural ends to perverse human uses and in the transformation of use-values into exchange-value: The tulip, white, did for complexion seek, And learned to interline its cheek: Its onion root they then so high did hold, That one was for a meadow sold. Another world was searched, through oceans new, To find the Marvel ofPeru. (1. 13)13 Commodification, the subjugation of use to the universal standards of exchange, is here our central metaphor of human knowledge and action, the reduction of all that is valued as an end in itself to the terms and standards of that by which it is coveted. This confusion of values, of means and ends, of signifiers and signifieds, is the primal confusion of our fall into moral, sexual, and linguistic duplicity, now rejuvenated by the new science and capitalist industry: The pink grew then as double as his mind; The nutriment did change the kind.... And yet these rarities might be allowed To man, that sovereign thing and proud, 13 Marvell underscores the grotesqueness of the tulip's transformation by expressing its artificial exchange-value ('what it's worth') not in abstract money terms but through its market equalization to something of incomparably greater use-value, a meadow.</page><page sequence="16">MICHAEL McKEON 6 Had he not dealt betwixt the bark and tree, Forbidden mixtures there to see. No plant now knew the stock from which it came; He grafts upon the wild the tame. (11. 9-Io0, 19-24) Thus the hybrid creations of botanical science are like the parvenu creations of the royal sale of aristocratic honours, a usurpation of divine and natural creativity which confounds what should be distinguished and disrupts the authoritative order of genealogical succession. From the perspective of the Mower, then, the hortus conclusus is the product not of God's art but of a strictly human license of enclosure, whose free enterprise consists in a freedom from external constraints and to expropriate and contain whatever lies in its path. The Baconian promise has become a pledge to engineer nature and society strictly according to man's own depraved and insatiable desires. As the Cromwell poems make clear, the search for 'another world' does not always mean for Marvell an adventure in capitalist expropriation, but the 'macro-pastoralism' of the voyages of discovery and settlement always entails for him the complex indeterminacy ofpastoralism itself. A subtle case in point is 'Bermudas' (1653?), the framed first-person narrative of a Puritan colonial party that has fled the sophisticated corruptions of Anglican prelacy to discover the locus amoenus of God's country in the Americas. Freedom of conscience, the dangerous concomitant of licentious market exchange in the United Provinces, may here be viewed sympathetically as the humble goal of godly pilgrims whose only desire is to be left in peace. Yet as we overhear them eagerly anticipating their solitude with God, we may be reminded of the pastoral Dorindas and Clorindas who innocently comprehend more than they ought. This is a related process of 'exchange', the anthropomorphic accommodation of the spirit to the earnest but naively egocentric under- standings of those who, like Bacon, would indulge the vision of themselves at the centre of a restored and oddly materialistic Eden: He gave us this eternal spring, Which here enamels everything,... He hangs in shades the orange bright, Like golden lamps in a green night, ... He makes the figs our mouths to meet, And throws the melons at our feet, But apples plants of such a price, No tree could ever bear them twice. (11. 13-14, 17-18, 2 1-24) The paradisal topics are traditional enough; it is the delicately personalized tone of cheerful self-satisfaction that forces one to linger over the image of God as an improving landlord, to be valued for the 'price' of his natural commodities. This is the religiosity (we might speculate uncomfortably) of</page><page sequence="17">62 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation which was born, in the very decades through which Marvell was living, the manifest destiny of modern imperialism. V The generic instability of much of Marvell's poetry, then, must be under- stood not only in terms of the putatively autonomous life-cycles of literary convention, nor simply as a reflection of the equivocal nature of his persistent and traditional themes, but also in relation to the instability of the social, political, and economic institutions of his times. A year after Cromwell's death and in the midst of the chaos that precipitated the restoration of Charles II, Marvell was elected to sit as Member of Parliament for Hull, a position he would retain until his death in 1678. In the public eye he slowly emerged, during these last decades, as the champion of toleration and parliamentary privilege, of religious and political freedom, whose writings prepared as much as any for the near-revolutionary politics of the Exclusion Crisis. This ideological sharpening of stance continues the movement of the Cromwellian period, and Marvell's own muted pastoral choice of public activism during that time is extended now, upon the hero's death, to an embrace of urban life in the metropolitan heart, punctuated by frequent letters home to the Hull Corporation in 'the country' on matters of commer- cial and ecclesiastical policy. But the general effect of this movement is not (as some have thought) to sacrifice that characteristic eclectic equilibrium which I have discussed in terms of his habitual engagement with the problem of mediation. After I66o this continues to be Marvell's preoccupation, but with the death of the republic and its heroic 'Protector', a subtle yet decisive modulation is required. If the years before the restoration are dominated by heroic panegyric leavened with satire, the succeeding period is marked by mock-heroic satire founded upon the perception of how things ought to be. And if Upon Appleton House (c. 1652) may be accounted Marvell's very singular 'pastoral epic', The Last Instructions to a Painter (1667) is his pastoral mock-epic. In the earlier poem, the poet's ingenuous role as 'surveyor' of the pastoral prospect is systematic (we move through house, garden, fields, woods, and river) yet fundamentally passive.14 This is Marvell as Fairfax: only obliquely are we aware what the successive and dizzying artificializa- tions of nature which are recorded in the poem owe to perspectival adjust- ments in the human camera from which our record proceeds. In The Last Instructions, by contrast, poet and painter join in the strenuously active discipline of a satiric 'reformation' of the prospect, a representation that is also explicitly an act of remaking: 14 See, for example, Stanzas I I, 46-49, 56-59, 63.</page><page sequence="18">MICHAEL McKEON 63 So thou and I, dear Painter, represent In quick effigy, others' faults, and feign By making them ridiculous, to restrain. (1.390) A large part of the difference lies in the prospect itself. As the minute particularity of Marvell's dissection encourages us to recognize, England's body politic has been overrun by a microscopic race of artful vermin bent upon stripping the living carcass to its skeleton. The Cromwellian arts of governmental mediation have failed, and England's leaders luxuriate in the corrupted arts of modern political management, of procurement, bribery, cheating, fraud, influence-peddling, acts of human depravity which Marvell finds it easy to associate with the dubious 'experiments' of the new science and the newly instituted Royal Society. 15 Yet if England's body is poisoned by these arts, it may be cured by others. In adopting now the traditional view of satire as the drastic but necessary antidote to moral and social ills, Marvell resists the chastened circumspection of 'The Coronet' and embraces the power of human art to reform art, to mediate a path to an alternative. No longer afraid to attempt that 'Which in expressing we ourselves betray', Marvell now takes on the role of poet as Cromwellian Hero, which he was soon to admire so greatly in his friend Milton. Thus one dominant mode of The Last Instructions is a confident mock-heroic procedure that consists in imitating his antagonists (as Milton imitates Satan) in the process of separating himself from them. Like the vermin, he indulges the fiction of their greatness, but to such heights that the praise reverses into degradation. Like them, he strips England naked, but it is this film of heroic folly and pretension whose very removal constitutes the cure. Like them he employs a 'scientific' method, but now in the positive and Baconian sense of penetrat- ing nature's laws to the end of reformation; thus the poet instructs the painter: With Hooke, then, through the microscope take aim, Where, like the new Comptroller, all men laugh To see a tall louse brandish the white staff. (1. i6)16 The new poetry is allied to the new science through a shared confidence that human artifice, although it is the disease, may artfully achieve also the cure; that the end need not be comprehended and corrupted by the means of its attainment. 15s See, for example, lines 49-78 on Anne Hyde, which conflate financial corruption, political hypocrisy, scientific duplicity, and sexual perversion. 16 The new Comptroller, Thomas Clifford, crypto-papist, leading fomenter of the Second Anglo-Dutch War, and member of the Cabal, had already tangled with Marvell in the House of Commons. The image of him brandishing his staff of office is compared to an illustration of an enlarged 'louse holding to a human hair', printed in Robert Hooke's Micrographia (1665). Thus Marvell's satiric metaphor transforms the dignified statesman into a parasite on the body politic. Christopher Hill reproduces Hooke's illustration in Century of Revolution, Plate 16 (facing p. I 17).</page><page sequence="19">64 Andrew Marvell and the Problem of Mediation Yet there remains a crucial element of restraint in this hilarious but very angry poem. Throughout, Marvell is willing to take his satiric dissection of parasitic evil only as far as Charles's courtiers and counsellors; the king himself is spared. For Marvell, as for most others in 1667, the Lord Chancellor Clarendon is the great scapegoat, but most of the other ministers (not to mention scores of lesser functionaries), although they escaped Clarendon's actual punishment, are obliged to suffer Marvell's satiric one. In halting the indictment at this point Marvell no doubt responds to a number of poetic, political, and prudential considerations. The result is that he remains in nominal accord with that last vestige of arcana imperii, the doctrine that the king cannot err, however fallible his counsellors may be. These latter are to be repudiated unconditionally in the language of the Mower's satire against enclosure: Bold and accursed are they that all this while Have strove to isle our Monarch from his isle, And to improve themselves, on false pretence, About the Common-Prince have raised a fence; The kingdom from the crown distinct would see And peel the bark to burn at last the tree. (1. 967) But Charles himself is reserved to play the more diverting and hopeful role of special audience and surrogate poet. The final section of the poem is an 'Envoy' addressed to the king, frankly advising the extirpation of evil counsellors and immediately introduced by the suggestion that it is now time for the royal government to undertake that strenuous labour of reformation which thus far has proceeded by satiric means: But this great work is for our Monarch fit, And henceforth Charles only to Charles shall sit. His master-hand the ancients shall outdo, Himself the painter and the poet too. To the King So his bold tube, man to the sun applied And spots unknown to the bright star descried, Showed they obscure him, while too near they please And seem his courtiers, are but his disease. (1. 945) Once again the magnifying powers of scientific technology are compared to those of satiric representation, but now also to the discernment of the king and to his potential capacity for a Cromwellian 'thorough reformation' of the state. The invidious comparison of Charles with Cromwell has tacitly underlain much of this poem's outrage at England's present subjugation to Dutch naval and commercial power. How sincere are Marvell's hopes that Charles may exercise the discipline necessary to reform the political corrup- tions on which the English war effort has foundered? It is difficult to answer this question, but one hint is contained in Marvell's cynical account of</page><page sequence="20">MICHAEL McKEON 65 attempts to blame the several miscarriages of the war on a relatively obscure commissioner of the navy, Peter Pett: Pett, the sea-architect, in making ships Was the first cause of all these naval slips: Had he not built, none of these faults had been; If no creation, there had been no sin. (1. 785) In his unwillingness to be deceived by the scapegoat-fiction as it attaches to Pett, Marvell ominously (if silently) alludes to the arbitrariness of belief in the official Clarendonian version. In a corrupt body, disease spreads to every member. The distinction between the king's political and his natural capacity is an artificial one, not immune from the disease but a symptom of it. This is not Marvell's or many people's public conclusion in I667, partly because few wished to call up so soon the spectre of 1641. Yet the corruptions of the Second Anglo-Dutch War helped persuade him to see not Dutch liberalism but French absolutism, not licentious liberty but arbitrary mono- poly, as the model of what was to be feared most at home. In three years, Charles was to sign the duplicitous Secret Treaty of Dover with the Catholic Louis XIV, and from this point on Marvell's progress into the role of parliamentarian patriot, champion of English freedoms, appears irrevers- ible. When he died in I678 on the eve of the Popish Plot he was being sought by the authorities for the recent publication of An Account of the Growth of Popery, and Arbitrary Government in England, a comprehensively inflammatory tract which nonetheless still forbears to indict Charles himself. A great distance has been travelled, so far as public engagement is concerned, from the circumspect observer of i65o to the Protestant patriot of 1678 and posterity. But Marvell's most central concerns have not altered, and in his gradual discovery of a fully public voice he has continued to meditate, in novel forms, upon the problems of human knowledge and action that preoccupy his entire career. Marvell's dedication to satiric and polemi- cal reformation during the final decade of his life bespeaks a hard-won but permanent confidence in the powers of a 'positive' secularization, in the efficacy of human inventiveness to achieve ethical and spiritual ends. If the seventeenth-century experience of secularization seems to us to have failed in the accommodation of the sacred to a profane world - if economic liberalism served only to licence individual acquisitiveness, if religious toleration of diverse faiths prefigured only secularism and the indifference to faith itself - these are the complex fruits of a historical process that exceptional men like Marvell were supremely gifted at reading and power- less, in the end, to direct.</page></plain_text>
