<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibitions THE AMERICAN LAWN: SURFACE OF EVERYDAY LIFE Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal 16June-8 November 1998; subsequent itinerary to be announced Nike "Air Super Zoom" sport training shoes, glass lantern slides collected in the 1920s and 1930s by the Garden Club of America, a pamphlet published by Levitt &amp; Sons on "The Care of Your Lawn and Landscaping," a copy of Thorstein Ve- blen's Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), illustrated patent applications for turf grass: these items constitute a small but represen- tative portion of the rigorously selected and exquisitely presented objects and ephemera that comprised the concluding exhibition of the Canadian Centre for Architecture's five-partAmerican Century series, TheAmeri- can Lawn: Suface of Everyday Life. Earlier exhibitions were devoted to Americanism in Europe (JSAH55 (1996): 178-182), unbuilt projects by Frank Lloyd Wright (JSAH 56 (1997): 207-210), photographic reinterpre- tations of Frederick Law Olmsted, and Dis- ney theme parks (JSAH57 (1998): 204-207). The lawn project was initiated by Georges Teyssot, coordinated and designed by Diller + Scofidio, and curated by a team composed of Beatriz Colomina, Elizabeth Diller, Alessandra Ponte, Ricardo Scofidio, Teyssot, and Mark Wigley, with Mark Wa- siuta as associate curator and Gwynne Keathley as researcher. For five months last year, TheAmerican Lawn occupied the CCA's six main exhibition rooms, with an "epi- logue" in the museum's octagonal gallery examining the lawn through the work of an impressive array of historical and con- temporary photographers. An accompany- ing publication, edited and introduced by Georges Teyssot with essays by the curators as well as other scholars, contextualizes some of the material included in the exhi- bition, but stands also as an important work in its own right. As is evident from the heteromorphous inventory begun above, this remarkable exhibition largely abandoned traditional curatorial staging techniques such as his- torical narrative or monothematic exegesis in favor of multiple and often divergent readings of a single, precarious figure: the American "lawn." Objects as diverse as institutional archival documents, works of contemporary art, and commercial lawn care catalogues were collected and juxta- posed according to principles of both com- monality and stark contrast, within a con- stellation of themes legible along a variety of axes. Throughout, the figure of the lawn acted as a kind of selection mechanism, binding things together even as its cultural status as a "common ground"-perhaps even the ground for a particularly Ameri- can style of democracy-was unraveled. Precisely this uncompromising struc- ture, along with all of the historiographical and theoretical questions it precipitated, lent the exhibition both force and impor- tance. Not the least was the very question of what, in the end, the exhibtion itself was about. The American Lawn raised the stakes of architectural display, in the sense that it did not allow us to take for granted the didactic or interpretive functions of mu- seum exhibitions in general. By flatly iden- tifying its object in its title, and subse- quently tracking down that object and its consequences in all manner of cultural production, the exhibition recognized the lawn as an indisputably historical phenom- enon, although the particular history to which it belongs was left forever in doubt. The introductory wall text announced a salient aspect of this constitutive ambigu- ity: "The history of the lawn unrolls as if two currents, two genealogies, met and fused into a hybrid: from one side, the 'vernacular,' descended from the small co- lonial garden; from the other, the nine- teenth-century 'aristocratic' tradition that [AndrewJackson] Downing imported from English theorists." By the late nineteenth century these two lines of descent had converged in the American suburban land- scape, "neither city nor country, neither public nor private: it is both the pastoral dream of the 'cabin in the clearing' and a technological surface carved out of the wilderness." Summarily positing the heri- tage of the lawn in this manner, along with the attendant series of "imaginary lines" connecting and dividing the inhabitants of such a landscape, the exhibition con- cerned itself primarily with assembling evi- dence of the multivalent roles assumed by the lawn under such volatile genealogical conditions. In doing so, The American Lawn also mobilized a tension familiar to visitors of museum exhibitions devoted to architec- ture or landscape architecture. This is the tension between the objects to which an exhibition refers (usually buildings or spaces) and the actual objects on view (usu- ally representations of buildings or spaces). Frequently, efforts to overcome the media- tion of technical or photographic represen- tations in favor of a "direct" encounter with the object-through full-scale recon- structions, for example-elide the inevi- table reframings and decontextualizations enacted by the institution. In contrast, the genre of the architectural "installation," a mode in which Diller + Scofidio often work, submits the museum or gallery expe- rience itself to analysis, decoding the condi- tions of display while often doing away with such external referents as buildings alto- gether. But The American Lawn fits comfort- ably into neither of these categories, while inhabiting each of them to a certain ex- tent. It was as much about representations of the lawn as it was about the lawn itself. Or, to put it another way, it was as much about the lawn as a site of representation as it was about the lawn as a subject of the discursive and visual representations that graced the walls of the CCA. Indeed, the first component of the show that visitors encountered was inscribed in 196 JSAH / 58:2, JUNE 1999</page><page sequence="2">the lawn of the museum itself, in the form of a work by the artist Mel Ziegler. Allowing parts of the lawn to grow above its usual manicured datum, the CCA's verdant front lawn recorded in raised numerals the esti- mated number of blades of grass that com- prise that greensward: "325,293,680." The handwriting was that of the CCA's found- ing director, Phyllis Lambert. Also hidden in the CCA's front yard was a sound piece by Diller + Scofidio that coyly invited mu- seum guests to "step on me... walk all over me... sit on me... dominate me." These works hinted at the reflexivity of the entire exhibition, in which the space of display (the museum) was itself folded into the notion of the lawn as a space of display. Immediately and repeatedly, the ostensible subject matter of the exhibition and the conditions under which that subject mat- ter was represented or experienced were fused into a single object of reflection. The exhibition utilized the six main rooms of the CCA's gallery plan as a kind of readymade organizational system, with each gallery in turn highlighting one of the lawn's many valences, introduced by a "Museum of the Lawn" subtly curated by Ponte and encased in a series of vitrines in the entrance hallway. The pyramidal sym- metry of the gallery layout, with a single entrance space positioned before two tiers of three rooms, allowed the exhibition de- sign to set the stage with the above wall text, accompanied by an introductory mise- en-abime of a welcome mat projected onto the floor of the museum, which replaced the traditional rectangle of artificial turf with a bird's-eye video scan following the movements of a lawn sprinkler. As in the introductory vitrines, with a collection of pink flamingoes in close proximity to a series of funereal lawns exhibited through photographs of postmortem front-yard ritu- als, scholarship and humor proceeded in tandem. Alongside the welcome mat was an archaeological collection of latter-day prosthetic lawn implements and garden- ing attire assembled to reproduce a surro- gate human suspended on the entrance wall. The central room, through which ac- cess to the remainder of the exhibition was gained, was dedicated to "the democratic surface." A copy of Veblen was displayed alongside Andrew Jackson Downing's A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Land- -g'.11WER I NOW K. ......... .

The space it- self contained a study in the evolution of lawn morphology, with nine models de- scribing the relative proportions of lawn to house to driveway to sidewalk in represen- tative suburban developments from the nineteenth century to the present, from Downing's Roland Park to Disney's Celebra- tion. These were suspended over nine infra- red aerial photographs of the regions from which they were excerpted. Taken to- gether, models and photographs converted the verdant dream of a suburban quasi- public realm into a striking document of territorial negotiation and realignment. On either side of this room were spaces dedicated to "decoding the lawn" and to "idyll and anxiety," respectively. The pro- cess of decoding was taken literally, as legal codes controlling property rights were con- tinuously interpreted in scrolling textual excerpts of lawsuits and other court cases, with filings by both plaintiff and defendant projected side by side onto the floor. On the surrounding walls was a series of small, obsessive stereoscopic photographs by Rob- ert Sansone of the borders between lawns, each of whose individual, adjustable set of anthropomorphic viewing glasses con- fronted the visitor with the razor-thin preci- pice dividing neighbors forever over issues such as relative grass height. Laterally opposite, "Idyll and Anxiety" juxtaposed cinematic segments featuring sinister lawns of all sorts, from David Lynch's Blue Velvet to Stephen King's Maxi- mum Overdrive, flanked by the serene visual propaganda of The Garden Club of America. The wall text provided interpre- tive historical context, arguing that the status of the lawn in the popular media has shifted since the 1950s from ground of domestic tranquility to site of communal disorder. Such micronarratives functioned primarily as asides to the constellation of exhibits themselves, which throughout the show read more as forensic evidence of some obscure crime than as verification of a recognizable series of events. The three innermost rooms divided the lawn even further, into layers of leisure, power, and pathology. A space dedicated to "the competitive lawn" explored the expansive world of lawn sports as a project of relentless aesthetic manipulation and technical refinement. Upside-down ath- letic footwear was clamped in a quasi- genealogical sequence to the underside of a long glass table (with the footwear incor- EXHIBITIONS 197</page><page sequence="3">porated structurally into the table's "legs") and surrounded by photographs of sta- dium mowing patterns and artificial turf, and of golf courses as improbable oases in the American desert. The post-Taylorist technologies of movement, figured in the complex geometries of the soles of the athletic shoes, were intersected with tech- nologies of public presentation, as the wall text underlined the elevation of stadium groundskeeping to an aesthetic practice with the advent of color television. Immediately adjacent was a more direct analysis of the lawn as a technological sur- face, in a room entitled "engineering the lawn." Here was perhaps the most represen- tative example of Diller + Scofidio's unique adeptness at combining a disarmingly re- fined presentational aesthetics with inci- sive cultural commentary. The room was dominated by a tightly balanced steel-and- glass structure gently cradling freeze-dried samples of "natural" turf grass species, offset against various analogous "species" of artificial turf. An LED text scrolling across a tilted mirror superimposed names and provenance over reflections of the "natural" samples. The production and dissemination of these "natural" species within a system of commercial exchange was made evident by the patent documents hung along one wall. This set of complica- tions converted the vivid visual inventory of turf grass diseases on the opposite wall into evidence of a theoretical principle underlying the lawn's status as object of mass-cultural obsession. The pathology of the lawn, perhaps its most "natural" at- tribute, opens on to the lawn's equally intense artificiality, as it spawns a health maintenance industry that goes under the name of "lawn care." The exhibition's last room was dedi- cated to the "power lawn." Here the lawn became monumental in scale, as the local pacts, bonds, and conflicts of its domestic incarnation were transformed into the ex- ercise of and resistance to state and corpo- rate power. Photographs by Ezra Stoller and others of prototypical postwar office buildings set off against sweeping expanses of grass lined the walls. Suspended in the middle of the space were four video moni- tors screening news footage of political demonstrations and rituals on the White House lawn, the Washington Mall, and other front yards of American public life. What bound these rooms together was also what differentiated them. In each case, the lawn was presented as an image and as a surface-the "surface of everyday life" of the exhibition's subtitle-whose cultural resonances and internalized conflicts run deep. The surface with nothing behind it but more surface is a category running through a substantial portion of contempo- rary historical and theoretical analysis, in- cluding the work of many of the exhibi- tion's organizers. Indeed, the unsteady epistemological status of the architectural, urban, or landscaped surface is what launched this exhibition on its trajectory of theoretical provocation. But to its credit, it resisted the pitfalls of much work in the field of cultural studies from which it drew some of its methods. By foregrounding the artificial/natural oscillation that the lawn lays down before even the most resolute representations of domesticity or power, the exhibition avoided naturalizing so- called popular culture as a source of a new, if highly mediated, authenticity. Not only is there nothing "deeper" lurking below the lawn; the lawn-as-image refuses any claims on a new and ubiquitous second nature as it spreads across the continent through the twentieth century. Consequently, organic grass and plastic grass emerge from this exhibition as equals. They are both as real as the patents, codes, images, and trademarks regulating and re- flecting their distribution and use. Such lateral cross-referencing is afforded by the intense interplay of a curatorial project dedicated to reconsidering the nature of a museum exhibition, and a strategy of dis- play dedicated to rearranging the architec- tural relations between objects and view- ers. The result is more a montage of excerpts or "quotations" from the every- day culture of the lawn and its historical contexts, than a seamless presentation of historiographical conclusions. This presentation of quotations recalls an incident not lacking relevance for ap- proaching this exhibition. Upon receiving the first draft of Walter Benjamin's famous essay on Charles Baudelaire, Theodor Adorno criticized the text's saturation with what Benjamin referred to as "dialectical images," or quotations torn from their historical context and recombined into a montage of effects. Adorno was dissatisfied with Benjamin's presentation of such ex- cerpts in what he called their "simple factic- ity" or, in other words, as historical frag- ments outside of a demystifying or mediating dialectic. It could be said that a similar process was at work in The American Lawn. Dialectics aside, there was no overall historical narrative, chronological or other- wise, overseeing the presentation of mate- rial. There was only the incessant, relent- less, elegant dance of objects and their frames. Contra Adorno, however, the re- sult was not unmediated immanence but, rather, a reflection on the mediating prop- erties of both the exhibition and its sub- ject. Architecture museum and lawn (and even the lawn of the architecture mu- seum) are sent into a spiral of referential- ity. Like the stereoscopes eerily suspended in front of photographs, the museum is converted into a device for seeing the quo- tidian lawn through new eyes. What emerges, however, is not another negoti- ated settlement between nature and cul- ture but, rather, another device-a soft, spongy ground out of which sprout houses and museums alike. - Reinhold Martin Columbia University Publication related to the exhibition: The American Lawn, edited by Georges Teyssot, with a preface by Phyllis Lambert and essays by Georges Teyssot, Monique Mosser, Therese O'Malley, Alessandra Ponte, Virginia ScottJenkins, Beatriz Colo- mina, and Mark Wigley, and a photo- graphic essay by Diller + Scofidio.
