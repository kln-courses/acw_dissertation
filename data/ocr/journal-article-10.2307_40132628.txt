<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pawel: Lysek. Jano i jego zbojniccy \amraci. London. Pol- ska Fundacja Kulturalna. 1977. 204 pages. In "Jano and His Highland-Brigand Comrades," a saga about the valiant exploits of three young Silesian mountaineers-turned-brigands during the last decade of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the author demonstrates a first- hand knowledge of the life, the folklore, the political and social problems of the Beskidy region. The third-person narrative of this work, consisting of fifteen parts, begins with splendid descriptions of nature perceived through the eyes of shepherds and brigands in an anthropomorphic way: "Over Girowa rose the moon which grazed on the immense space of an empty valley." The pastoral backdrop is followed by a ring-structure narrative. An incident in- volving the theft of horses from a wealthy innkeeper intro- duces to us the brigand-protagonists and is succeeded by a flashback to their childhood. Thereafter the plot develops in linear fashion, bringing us back to the initial incident. This structural device lends the narrative an element of suspense and sophistication. The narration, a beautiful blend of literary Polish with the dialects of Silesian, Slovak, Tatra and Hungarian mountaineers, is frequently inter- spersed with lively dialogues, colorful descriptions of cus- toms, legends, authentic folk and brigand songs which add both verisimilitude and freshness to the saga, making it a rare folkloric chrestomathy. The epic quality of the work is intensified by presenting the heroes' growing-up process in an unhurried and ideal- ized manner. Jano and his comrades are romantics at heart. Not wanting to serve in the army of the oppressor and yearning for freedom and adventure, Jano, Anton and Palko join the outlaws, who in the manner of Robin Hood and the native legendary predecessors Ondraszek and Janosik take the law in their own hands, distributing among the needy the booty plundered from the rich. Sensitive and capable of platonic, mutual love, they are not only compassionate, brave and noble brigands but are also capable of expressing the inner struggle between their attraction for the glorified existence of an outlaw and their love for family life and the native soil. The latter wins out at the end. Jano and Palko forsake adventure and freedom to join their loved ones and settle down to a happy but ordinary life. The naivete of this ending lends the work a fairy-tale, nostalgic quality, thus enhancing its folkloric characteristics. I find the portrayal of the protagonists much too ideal- ized. Their wisdom, clarity and power of reasoning and their homespun philosophy far exceed their simple back- ground or their age. However, this idealization becomes plausible if one accepts it as part of a folkloric genre and keeps in mind the author's fervent desire to present re- gional legends of his origin in a most attractive way. Lysek shows a lack of bias in contrasting the idealized protag- onists with villains who, though successful in their treach- erous schemes as brigands, are punished, so that ultimately good prevails over evil. The usage of dialect and some similarities in subject mat- ter and setting remind one of Tetmajer's "In the Rocky Highlands," written between 1903 and 1911. However, Lysek's work, because of its epic, more idyllic quality and its effective characterization, is more compelling in rousing the reader from the drabness of life to a feeling of strong identification with the adventurous spirit of the highland brigands. One has to admire the emigre author's persistence in writing in Polish on an uncommon subject, which shows his strong attachment to the region of his origin. Rochelle Stone UCLA</page></plain_text>
