<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INDELIBLE WEAVING OF TEXTILES Alberto Ruy Sanchez // N othing is deeper than the skin," wrote Paul Valery. Indeed, his provocative statement might be applied to the tradi tional textiles of Mexico, worn as a sort of surrogate skin throughout several regions of the country. For the imaginary threads of the past and present are woven into the colorful threads of a huipil. And in Chiapas, especially, "the woven world" discloses a wealth of truly exceptional forms. In this issue of Artes deMexico, we have made an effort to explore the indelible weft of this woven elegance by gather ing a range of views with regard to these textiles which, admittedly, cloak and uncover more than meets the eye. Andres Fabregas, an anthropologist from Chiapas, invites us to consider these textiles as examples of cultural resistance: a soci ety's fortress of the soul throughout the centuries; a beautifully encoded identity which men and women wear over their bodies like an armor of cotton that is nonetheless stronger than steel. Alfonso Alfaro, another brilliant anthropologist, follows this same thread to show us the diverse meanings of garments worn in Chiapas as well as in other cultures. Meanings that are social, bodily and magical. The writing of desire weaving itself in front of the mirror of the world. Yet in making these textiles, a door and a staircase are also woven to lead us into other worlds. The mythic poems and tales recounted by the women of Chiapas are compiled and translated by Ambar Past. Our per ception is subtly widened as we hear the words of the actual universe in which these textiles flourish. Also turning to the spoken word, historian Margarita de Orellana offers us the voices of several weavers in Chiapas, including that of Pedro Meza, the virtual guardian of the tradition at the weaving cooperative Sna Jolobil, the "House of Weaving." These voices become the point of departure for what might become a study in New History, or the History of Consciousness, taking textiles as the warp in the mindset of a time. De Orellana clearly signals four routes in understanding our relationship to these textiles. All equally important, the first involves the immediacy of their beauty—and our team of editors ancj design ers at Artes de Mexico has made an effort to compel the reader by translating the immediate beauty of those forms into the layout on the page. In the second route, textiles are viewed as a social sign: an index of one's position within the commu nity expressed by each garment, or as the outward emblem of one's community in front of others. An individual and col lective identity. Equally evocative is a third route in which textiles constitute a forest of symbols where the encoded cultural meaning of a community emerges before our eyes. In the fourth route, open to further study, textiles are seen as part of a wider, imaginary warp which includes the play of images that weavers have of themselves and their tradition, in view of the successive presence, throughout the century, of anthropologists from different countries in the Chiapas highlands. A dia logue between collective imaginations that form the texture of a present mindset. The third point mentioned above is thoroughly explored by Walter F. Morris, author of the exceptional book Living Maya. In the article published in this issue, Morris carefully establishes a symbolic interpretation of these textiles in his reading of a ceremonial huipil—and his method, as always, is both compelling and provocative. Among the various activi ties he accomplished throughout the many years spent in Chiapas, Morris systematically compiled textiles that offer a more thorough understanding of the manual art in this region. The result of that singular effort is known as the Pellizzi Collec tion, in honor of anthropologist Francesco Pellizzi who promoted the work and supported its completion. An established Maya scholar, Pellizzi is also the editor of the outstanding magazine RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics, published in New York. Here he describes how the collection was conceived while outlining several possibilities for further development. Finally, we have included some poems by D. H. Lawrence—translated into Spanish by Magali Tercero and Roberto Tejada— to enrich the diverse images evoked by this universal spreading of roots, both deep-fixed and aerial. To synthesize the different contributions in this issue, textiles can be viewed as the indelible weft in the recovered, decoded weaving of images, fortresses, signs, and myths: mysterious, though undeniable examples of beauty. In short, this issue is an invitation to caress these textiles from Chiapas with the fingers of the mind. ^ Translated by Roberto Tejada Alberto Ruy Sanchez Translated by Roberto Tejada</page><page sequence="2">WEAVING a Fortress that has been a key factor in preserving identity.

These pieces are signs themselves: executed with components that obey a very different organization from ours. Theirs, it seems, is a system that does not separate the iconic from the conceptual, nor the various realms of the real the way we do. Theirs is an art performed by fingers that manifest a sensual relation to different textures, the whole body stirring with an enormous force when it works the heavy wool; their models are transmitted, copied, or dreamt. The elements in these pieces are items that can be interpreted by means of very different codes: signs that evoke and explain, invoke and arouse, recall and propose: garments worn by mortals and saints.

The same thing goes with weaving. The goddesses created weaving; they were the first teachers of the art. In dreams, they reveal our duties. Weaving is an art that belongs almost exclusively to women, which ■ 91 is why they know more. In Tenejapa, weaving is beyond the comprehen sion of men; it is too difficult. While a man may cultivate the land, pro vide for his home or cany heavy loads, it is virtually impossible for him to live without a woman. Even the male authorities of the towns fail to per form their duties properly if they don't have a woman at their side to share those tasks." His words prompt a curiosity to know about his own past. We ask how he became involved with textiles, how he became convinced of the importance of this art. Without hesitation, he replies: "My mother contin ued a tradition without stopping to wonder why. She inherited what our ancestors left her. It was important to her because clothing was a neces sity. Not only that: how was she supposed to have felt right if she didn't embroider her clothes? She wasn't the only one: everyone felt it was an obligation. The better the weaving, the more respect they awakened in oth ers. Although they also ran the risk of inciting envy. For some, weaving was a way of excelling, and of bettering oneself; for others, it meant sell ing quickly to those who weren't familiar with the rules of the trade." Pedro recalls his own upbringing: "Since as far back as I can remember I tried learning this difficult art by interweaving any kind of thread I could lay my hands on. Boys are not allowed to weave, nor to use the yarn with which the women make their huipiles. In my house, the boys were for bidden to pass under a woman's loom because, if they got tangled, my mother used to say they might get ill. She also used to say that if a boy put his head through the loom, he would eventually find himself eating ^WBMWi plenty of atole because the threads are starched in corn gruel. However, when she began to notice my tremendous curiosity, my mother put me to the test one day: 'Take this yarn.

This intertwining of images and practices, this Years later, Pedro mastered the craft. Though he sold bags, looms and weaving of separate minds, jointly productive in the traditional arts of other articles, he was still unaware of weaving's significance. "It was like Mexico, poses an interesting phenomenon for any historian open to new living in a forest. Everything in it is ours: it belongs to us. Yet we never perspectives regarding history, particularly to the historian of Mexico's ask ourselves about its value or where it came from. Those questions sur- manual arts. faced later." Pedro now spends his life answering those questions. For years Consequently, textiles from Chiapas can be studied as forming part of he has lived immersed in the complex language of textiles.

Any close examination will have to consider four different levels when approaching the problem which arises Textiles and History in our contact with this phenomenon. The following is a list of these lev els for those who would like to pursue the mental itinerary briefly out One thing seems clear after our visit: both Pedro Meza and the other weav- lined here. ers consider themselves messengers from a bountiful world far back in time. 1.

In their clothes, then, we can recognize the positions 9 2 of the different members of each community, from children, bachelors and married men to eminent figures highly respected for their wisdom. This second level has been studied by many scholars of Chiapanec culture, mainly by anthropologists whose contributions have been extremely im portant. Relevant studies include those of Ricardo Pozas, both in Chamula and his novel Juan Perez Jolote, and those of Calixta Guiteras Holmes in Los peligros del alma; as well as Andres Fabregas Puig in his article published here on textiles as a form of cultural resistance. Despite the importance of this second contact, however, there is still a difficult, symbolic reality for us to decipher: a complexity which eludes conventional analysis. 3. Symbolic level. (Living Syncretism): We know that huipil designs are emblems that emerge from the fusion of Mayan and Christian cosmologies. A case in point is the hybrid statue of the culturally-Spanish Virgin dressed as a Mayan goddess. This example is just one manifestation of the living syncretism that has evolved over the centuries, but there are others in the communal and religious life of the native Chiapanecs, including various fiestas. The Chamula carnival, for instance, displays a blend of Christian and autochthonous mythologies. Among the most moving examples of this syncretism is the interpretation of the life of Christ in Ricardo Pozas' novel Juan Perez Jolote which is also outlined in his important anthropological writings. "Before San Manuel was bom, the sun was cold, like the moon. The earth was inhabited by pukujes who used to eat people. The sun began to glow when the Christ Child was born, the son of the Virgin, and the Lord our Savior. The Virgin's relatives were pukujes—]ews. When she knew she was pregnant, she said to St. Joseph: 'I am with child.' Her relatives knew colorful and decorative abstract figures. In this first contact we appreciate that when the Christ Child came, there would be light, and running from the variety of the designs, the colors and the compositions. Clothes are an their house, they went to the Virgin. Then they mounted a donkey and expression of the collective group. Aesthetic guidelines are established by rode to Bethlehem.
