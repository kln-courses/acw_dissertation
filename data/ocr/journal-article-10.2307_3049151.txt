<plain_text><page sequence="1">VINCENT SCULLY, American Architecture and Urbanism, New York, Praeger, 1969. Pp. 262; 525 ills. $18.50. It would seem necessary at the outset to recognize that this book was created out of its own reservations. Among them is the view that art history should love old and new things, yet not make undue or hasty allowances for the new on the basis of increasing satis- faction with the old. The more informed art historians become, the easier it may be to disregard factors of quality in the present. The customary sequence for the mechanics of interpretation, by casting the image of the building through the particular awareness of the historian, may also cause dislocation. Final accountability must show up where it has always belonged, back on the shoulders of the originator, the architect. For this purpose Mr. Scully intro- duces a new personnage, the historian architect. Thus, "the architect should be regarded as a kind of physical historian, be- cause he constructs relationships across time: civilization in fact." If this new description of the architect can be accommodated, then it becomes much less puzzling that Professor Scully is so absorbed, in a volume supposedly national in scope, with the latest buildings in and around New Haven. (In at least partial vindication, it has to be inserted right away that Yale has of course attracted, over several generations going back to George Howe and farther, a very talented and stimulating architectural company, and many of these buildings are a legitimate outcome of that circumstance.) Mr. Scully explains his reasoning in the preface: "New Haven, Connecticut, receives rather more than its share of space in these pages because it is the field of battle which the author best knows." There has to be immediate, fundamental tilting. Out of the ensuing confrontations will come the revelations for a logic, which then may apply universally. And with such a degree of originality, boldness, insight and dispatch as Professor Scully has brought to all of his writing (including again the intriguing anthropomorph- ism), the effort at synthesis is bound to go pretty far. The cover jacket, the public media, and Mr. Scully apparently identify the book as persuasive evidence of a transformation in his outlook, a radical departure. In a newspaper interview released by the Washington office of the Boston Globe, citing it in connection with "Sweeping up after Earth Day," Professor Scully declared that he was henceforth abandoning his old approach by "trying to get away from the dilettantish point of view on architecture and into its larger social dimensions." He is about to discard what he feels is the aestheticism and restraint of art-historical method to be directly "involved in the whole complexity of urban America - redevelop- ment, highways, zoning and the rest." He wants to consider the bad examples along with the good. The primary role he chooses is obviously to be one of alternative adversary and advocate, but oddly enough Professcr Scully does not next immerse himself in the common lot, the mass culture, the anonymous act, anywhere to the point at which a few of his colleagues at Yale have found themselves. "Historian architects" like Charles Moore, when he writes so tellingly of the vernacular architecture of California, or Robert Venturi, so colorful on Las Vegas and elsewhere, appear by contrast to take the current scene much more on trust, as given for granted. Moreover, the pace of the book is still similar to that of the art-history lecture, swinging along and touching first here and then there - with a marvelous, poetic, beguiling cadence, such as art historians can best appreci- ate. And the illustrations, unusually well-selected as in his previous books, are adjusted to show most effectively in pairs, as indicated at once by the two pictures on the cover. These are details almost as on a classroom screen of the American cut and slash of the fronts of a flat-boarded and black-windowed frontier town and the model of a house at Princeton for Millard Meiss, the "distinguished historian of the trecento," by Yale architect Robert Venturi. One we must think of as vanished and the other as not built - too bad - but the genuine emanation comes from Scully's chronic delight in juxtaposing the primitive and the sophisticated for dramatic impact. So, on balance, Professor Scully may not have departed so far from his older self as first imagined. He resorts also to the older adage that the exception more often proves the rule, just as he utilized New Haven as an aid in exemplifying all the rest of America. He tells us early that his first intuition is that "the general pattern of American architecture is perhaps best introduced by the strongest exception to it, within which, nevertheless, the pull of its influence can be perceived." Hence the claim that Louis Kahn is destined to remain the most influential architect of our age, not by virtue of how many of his buildings get built, or even how they take up and condition their occupants from an open and fluid society, but rather because by exception Kahn arrived at self- realization and the intellectual heights fairly late in life, because he</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 471 cared a great deal about what he was doing, and because he became for many in the next generation a solitary, towering, prophetic figure. The moral is twofold. Intellectualism on the part of architects can be a kind of expiation for the many apparent sins committed in the public domain in the name of building, and in architecture truth may be more early out than in other spheres of human endeavor because it is so highly apparent both to those who do and those who don't see it accurately. The American responsibility is to come back to the man, the architect, rather than the democratic mass, as it did in its time with the help of historians to Sullivan and Wright, those most American of Americans. Architectural history may confer first sensibility for the culture as a whole. There can be little or no substance to this analogy, but it is striking how often Mr. Scully's outreach (beyond the implicit guilt and the identity search) recalls that of the earlier Yale divine, Timothy Dwight. Like President Dwight, Scully wants to discover how it really is by wandering out across the land and assimilating its atmosphere, as the former did in his journals of travel across New England and New York in the early nineteenth century. Many think of Dwight as only a gazetteer, but what he observed of habitation and cultivation suggested to him what people were like intrinsically, deep-down - whether God-fearing or not, industrious or not, worthy or not to shape the American wilderness. The quality of the environment in time derived from the inner quality of the individual. Dwight subsequently revealed that he took to wandering as therapy for a college president faced with the religious controversy then going on at New Haven, in which he had a major part. The perceptual fingers Scully runs over the setting for Indian habitations in the West, the Virginia ofJefferson, the Midwestern towns of Sullivan and Wright, and the New England villages, are sensitive in the extreme, but they have not yet touched urbanism as most people define the term. Histories dealing with the huge, unwieldy, indeterminate, group-centered, everyday problems of contemporary urbanism are urgently needed, but this isn't one of them, at least by the usual definition. As soon as such voluminous issues are raised in the text, Mr. Scully sweeps them off the board with the back of the hand. The lasting benefit from this book, and it is no mean one to be sure, will perhaps come from the descriptive force and skill with which the author addresses his task, item by item, right up to the present, and the bigger question he raises: how has individualism so far worked through architecture on this pluralistic society, financially and geographically gigantic in scale, and is it becoming obsolete at last ?
