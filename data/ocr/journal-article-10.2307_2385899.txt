Abstract: This paper examines how theJapanese public per- ceives the natural world and its conservation, mainly wild- life. Limited comparisons are made to the United States. Data was collected in both countries using similar conceptual and methodological frameworks. Closed-ended surveys were conducted of random samples of theJapanese and American publics, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 50 en- vironmentally knowledgeable Japanese. A central interest was the apparent inconsistency of a pre- sumed special Japanese appreciation of nature concurrent with a pattern of widespread environmental abuse exten- sively reported in the literature. The results of this study par- tially elucidate this paradox. Japanese appreciation for na- ture was found to be very narrow and idealized, primarily focusing on single species and lacking an ecological and ethical perspective. TheJapanese and American publics were both found to possess strong affection for particularly fa- vored species and enjoyed direct experiential contact with individual aspects of the environment Both cultures were similarly pragmatic toward nature, and somewhat indiffer- ent regarding the environment when it possessed little emo- tional value. TheJapanese public placed far greater value on satisfactions derived from control and mastery over nature. Additionally, the Japanese expressed far less ethical or eco- logical concern for nature and wildlife than citizens of the United States. Americans also had significantly greater knowledge of wildlife. Introduction Japan and the United States are among the leading eco- nomic and social powers in the world today.

Resumen: En este documento se examina c6mo es que el ptublico japones percibe al mundo natural y a su conserva- ci6n, principalmente en relaci6n a la vida silvestre; se bace una comparacion limitada con el publico de los Estados Unidos. Se tomaron datos de ambos paises utilizando un marco de referencia conceptual y metodol6gico similar. Se llevaron a cabo encuestas en muestras al azar de piblico americano y de ptublico japones, y se hicieron entrevistas de fondo con cincuenta ambientalistas japoneses. Un interes central fue la aparente inconsistencia de una presupuesta apreciaci6n especial de la naturaleza por los japoneses en concordancia con una amplia distribuci6n del abuso ambiental reportado extensamente en la literatura Los resultados de este estudio aclaran parcialmente esta paradoja La apreciaci6n de losjaponesespor la naturaleza se encontr6 muy cerrada e idealizada; enfocandose primar- iamente a especies tunicas y careciendo de una perspectiva ecol6gica y etica Se encontr6 que tanto el publico japones como el americano poseen una fuerte afeccion por especies particularmente favorecidas y gozan de la experiencia de contacto directo con aspectos individuales del ambiente. Ambas culturas fueron similarmente pragmaticas bacia la naturaleza y de alguna manera indiferentes en relaci6n al ambiente cuando el ambiente poseia poco valor emocional. El ptublico japones le di6 mucho mais valor a las satisfac- ciones derivadas del control y el dominio sobre la natu- raleza Adicionalmente, los japoneses expresaban mucho menos preocupaciones, eticas o ecol6gicas por la naturaleza y la vida silvestre, que los americanos. Los americanos tam- bien revelaron tener significativamente mas conocimientos sobre la vida silvestre. tively, these two nations exert enormous socioeco- nomic and political influence as measured by such criteria as gross national product (GNP), international trade statistics, and per-capita levels of income and con- sumption (CIA 1989). Nineteen eighty-eight data reveal that the two countries account for more than one-third of the world's GNP but comprise just over 7% of the 297 Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="2">298 Japanese Perceptions of Wildlife planet's human population. This level of economic ac- tivity inevitably results in enormous environmental im- pacts. More indirectly, the two countries serve as im- portant models of environmental management and conservation, particularly for many of the world's Third World nations. Given this level of influence, it is relevant to examine prevailing perceptions in Japan and the United States toward the natural world and its management and con- servation. This paper offers some data regarding one particularly important aspect of environmental values and perceptions-attitudes toward wildlife and its con- servation. Previous research using a similar conceptual and methodological framework explored attitudes toward wildlife in the United States, Germany, and Botswana (Kellert 1980a,b, 1981; Schulz 1985; Mordi 1987). This paper reviews the results of research conducted in Ja- pan in 1987 that also employed this study approach. Due to space limitations this data is only compared with results obtained in the United States. Background Information on Japan The Japanese population is about 123 million people, making Japan the world's seventh most populous nation with roughly 2.4% of the planet's human inhabitants (Yano 1984). Japan's population growth has been rela- tively modest, comparable to that found in other indus- trially developed nations. Still, the Japanese population has nearly quadrupled during the past century from an 1870 total of 32 million (Bunge 1981). The size of Ja- pan's human population is underscored by the nation's population density, roughly 323 persons km2 in contrast to 248 in West Germany and 25 in the United States (Yano 1985). Moreover, in relation to existing arable land, the Japanese population is an extraordinary 2256 persons km2 compared with 820 in West Germany and 103 in the United States (Marsh 1987). Three-quarters of the Japanese population resides in urban areas, the population densities in some sections of Tokyo exceed- ing 20,000 persons per km2. This very uneven popula- tion distribution has resulted in nearly two-thirds of the country, mainly the mountainous areas, having less than 50 people km2. Japan's 1988 GNP was approximately $1.8 trillion, making it the world's third largest economy after the United States and the Soviet Union (CIA 1989). Eco- nomic growth statistics have been particularly impres- sive. Japan's 1960 GNP was $306 billion, and the coun- try's exports increasing from $4.1 billion in 1960 to $264.9 billion in 1988. Despite Japan's industrial suc- cess, in 1988 the country still had 4.48 million people engaged in agriculture, compared with 3.3 million in the UTnited States, which has roughly twice the population Keflert (CIA 1989). Japanese society also differs greatly from that of the United States in its much heavier reliance on fish products. Japan is the world's largest per-capita con- sumer of fish and the second largest fishing nation Qap- anese Environment Agency 1982). Although Japan has a relatively large human popula- tion in a small geographic area, the country possesses a comparatively rich and diverse biota. "Compared to ar- eas of similar size, like Great Britain and New Zealand, the number of species is large in Japan" Japanese En- vironment Agency 1982). One hundred and twenty-two mammal species have been identified in Japan, com- pared to 67 in Great Britain and Ireland, an area roughly similar in size. Over 600 bird species, including 100 subspecies, have been recorded in Japan, again roughly double the number found in Great Britain and Ireland. An unusually large number of herpetological species oc- cur in Japan, including 84 reptile and 58 amphibian spe- cies. The endemicity of the salamanoids is especially remarkable; it includes the world's largest amphibian, the Japanese giant salamander, Andrias japonicus. The giant salamander is one of a relatively large number of unique, relic species once found on mainland Asia that migrated and adapted to the ecological conditions of the Japanese islands. Other notable endemics include the Japanese "snow monkey" (Macaca fuscata), serow (Capricornis crispis, an antelope-like animal), crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), and Iriomote cat (Mayalurus iriomotensis) (Shinjiro 1981).Japan is also exceptional for its many insect species, having roughly four or five times the number found in Great Britain, although pre- cise figures are unknown. This exceptional biological diversity is largely a con- sequence of Japan's considerable biogeographical varia- tion and its oceanic character. Three characteristics of the Japanese archipelago are especially important-the nation's highly mountainous terrain, its broad latitudinal variation, and the large number of islands (Trewartha 1965). These factors have resulted in substantial cli- matic and habitat variation. Japan's latitudinal range is approximately 3000 kilo- meters, roughly equivalent to the distance from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, to Key West, Florida (Marsh 1987). This latitudinal range is more than 20 degrees from the boreal and subalpine regions of Hokkaido at 45.5 N to the neotropical islands of Okinawa and the Ryuku chain at roughly 24 N. Japan's highly mountainous terrain and recent volcanic activity are suggested by the fact that more than three-quarters of the Japanese archipelago consists of mountains, more than 24 of these have ele- vations of greater than 3000 meters, and 55% of the mountains possess a gradient of greater than 14 degrees. The Japanese archipelago consists of some 3900 islands and has a total coastline of nearly 33,000 kilometers. While Japan represents just 1/400th of the planet's ter- restrial surface, its shoreline is the second or third larg- Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="3">Keflert est of any country in the world. These latitudinal, ele- vational, and coastal features have created the basis for much of Japan's diversity of plants and animals. The Japanese and Nature It has frequently been asserted that the Japanese culture has an especially high regard, appreciation, and affection for nature (Anesaki 1932; Benedict 1974; Higuchi 1979; Ichiro 1972; Ito 1972; Kato 1971; Minami 1970; Murota 1986; Nakane 1970; Ono 1962; Oyadomori 1985; Rolston 1989; Saito 1983; Stein 1976; Stewart-Smith 1987; Suzuki 1973; Taylor 1990; Tsutsui 1981; Watan- abe 1974). The notion of a relatively unique Japanese "harmony with nature ... has been [suggested by] evi- dence in religion, art and literature, and from traditional rituals and customs" (Oyadomori 1985). Often cited expressions of this appreciation include Japanese tradi- tions of shintoism, flower arranging, plant cultivation (e.g., bonsai), the tea ceremony, Haiku and other poetry forms, rock gardening, various celebrations of the sea- sons, and a reverential focus on particular features of the environment, among others. Watanabe (1974:280) remarked that a basic charac- teristic of Japanese culture is "a love of nature ... [that] has resulted in a refined appreciation of the beauty of nature ... [a view] of man ... considered a part of na- ture, and the art of living in harmony with nature [as the] wisdom of life." Murota (1985:105) contrasted this perspective with predominant views in Europe and North America: "The Japanese view of nature is quite different from that of Westerners ... The Japanese na- ture is an all-pervasive force ... Nature is at once a blessing and friend to the Japanese people ... People in Western cultures, on the other hand, view nature as an object and, often, as an entity set in opposition to humankind." Saito (1983:47) identified three important features of this traditional Japanese attitude toward na- ture: "(1) Nature as friend of man, instead of servant to be used, enemy to be subdued, or an obstacle to be overcome. (2) There is no fundamental difference be- tween man and nature. (3) The relationship between man and nature is ... harmonious and unified." The Jap- anese appreciation of nature has been cited as a major reason for the relatively large proportion of the nation being designated as national park or other protected area (Sutherland &amp; Britton 1985; Oyadomori 1985). Despite claims of a special Japanese respect, appreci- ation, and even "love" of nature, current evidence exists of widespread Japanese abuses of the environment, as well as apparent indifference toward sound resource conservation and management practices (Aoyanagi 1984; Grapard 1985; Hirasawa 1978; Kamei 1983; Lin- den 1989; Luoma 1989; Moreby 1982; Saiki 1988; Snei- der 1989; Stewart-Smith 1987; Sun 1989; Taylor 1990; Japanese Perceptions of Wildlife 299 Terry 1989; Upham 1976, 1979; Van Wolferen 1989). Japan has been prominently identified as a primary con- tributor in many areas of global environmental and wild- life destruction, including damaging whaling practices, excessive wildlife products exploitation (e.g., ivory, tor- toise shell, musk), harmful high-seas drift-net use, and tropical forest destruction. The Japanese have registered more exceptions than any other nation to the rulings of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, and until quite recently had no internal law for the protection of endangered and threatened species. Japan's destructive environmental impacts prompted one conservationist to refer to the Japanese as "environmental terrorists" (Sneider 1989). Although a relatively large proportion of Japan has been designated as protected natural area, much of this land is afflicted by extensive human development (Oyadomori 1985; Kaku 1978). This apparent paradox of a presumed Japanese appre- ciation and respect for nature concurrent with a pattern of repeated environmental and wildlife destruction has puzzled many scholars (Grapard 1985; Ikoma 1970; Oy- adomori 1985; Saito 1983; Taylor 1990; Watanabe 1974). The results of this study, as well as additional literature review, are offered to provide some explana- tion for this paradox. It will be suggested that the Japa- nese appreciation and respect for nature has tended to be very narrow and idealized, primarily focusing on sin- gle species and individual aspects of the environment, and typically lacking an ecological or ethical perspec- tive. A Study of Japanese Attitudes, Knowledge, and Behaviors Data was collected in 1986 and 1987. Two primary methodologies were used-a closed-ended survey of the Japanese public, and in-depth interviews with a sam- ple of Japanese recommended as having an extensive knowledge of Japanese attitudes toward nature. The design and conduct of the survey of the Japanese public was methodologically similar to previous inves- tigations in the United States and Germany (Kellert 1979, 1980b, 1981, 1985, 1989; Schulz 1985). The Jap- anese survey required an average of 43 minutes to ad- minister and was conducted in person. The survey con- sisted of 198 closed-ended questions on the following topics: basic attitudes toward animals and nature, atti- tudes toward wildlife management and conservation, knowledge of animals, awareness of wildlife conserva- tion issues, behavioral interactions with animals and na- ture, and respondent demographic characteristics. The survey was pretested in the United States and Japan. A bilingual research assistant participated in the pretesting and translation of the survey. A Japanese re- search firm was hired to assist in the translation of the Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="4">300 Japanese Perceptions of Wildlife Keflert survey, pretesting, selection of a random sample, per- sonal interviewer training, data collection, interview verification, and data-coding. Faculty members at Kyoto University and the National Institute of Statistical Math- ematics participated in the survey design. Funding for the study was provided by the G. R. Dodge Foundation, the Yale University Center for International and Area Studies, and the Fulbright Council for International Ex- change of Scholars, Japan-U.S. Commission. The closed-ended survey was administered to 450 randomly selected Japanese in the summer of 1986. Be- cause of the limited sample size and costs involved, data collection was confined to four primary sample sites: Tokyo (23 wards); Toyosaka, Niigata; Miyako, Iwate; and Nakashibetsu, Hokkaido. Tokyo was selected as repre- sentative of a Japanese urban area. The other sampling locations were considered rural by Japanese standards, an,d were selected to represent areas known for rice production, fisheries, and dairy farming (Trewartha 1965; Japan Environment Agency 1982). Each rural area was minimally 125 kilometers from a city of more than one million people and 80 km from urban areas of more than 500,000 population. Ten locations in each sample site were equidistantly selected for sample selection purposes from a list of National Census Zones (each zone consisting of roughly 50 households). Within each sample selection area, quo- tas for age, sex, and educational level were met accord- ing to population statistics for these areas. Personal in- terviews were conducted with a single randomly selected individual within the randomly selected house- holds. An initial contact and three call-backs were re- quired before the designated respondent could be dropped and substituted. More than 70% of the initially designated respondents completed the survey. Twenty percent of the interviews were validated for control purposes. A typology of basic attitudes toward animals and na- ture, previously used in the American and German stud- ies, was employed in the Japanese investigation. Brief definitions of the attitude types are indicated in Table 1, although more detailed descriptions are available else- where (Kellert 1980a; Kellert &amp; Clark 1991). Question- naire scales were developed to measure most of the attitude types, based on cluster analysis. The scales con- sisted of statistically independent clusters of individual closed-ended questions. Adequate aesthetic and scien- tistic attitude scales were not developed. Both attitude dimensions were limitedly assessed through in-depth in- terview and specific survey question results. Whenever possible, identical or similar questions wording was used in the Japanese survey and in the United States. Cultural variations and pretest findings did, however, result in alteration in the wording of some questions. Additionally, cluster analysis results produced varying groups and varying numbers of questions as the basis Table 1. Basic wildlife values.

As a consequence of differ- ences in scale development, data collection procedures, and time of the Japan and United States studies, statisti- cal tests of significance were not considered an appro- priate basis of comparison. Attitudes toward varying wildlife conservation and management issues were also examined. Topics covered included conservation of endangered species, animal damage control, hunting, wildlife habitat destruction, and marine mammal conservation. Knowledge of animals was assessed by 25 true-false questions, questions on species endangerment and ex- tinction, bird species identification, and awareness of wildlife issues. The 25 true-false questions were used to create a knowledge-of-animals scale. Questions on behavioral interactions with nature cov- ered the following topics: national park and zoological park visitation, nature-related television-viewing, pur- chase of wildlife products, pet ownership, hunting, fish- ing, nature photography, bird-watching, conservation organization membership, farming and livestock-raising, and insect-collecting. Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="5">Keilert Japanese Perceptions of Wildlife 301 In addition to the survey of the Japanese public, in- depth interviews were conducted with 50 Japanese re- garded as possessing an extensive knowledge of Japa- nese attitudes toward nature. This methodology primarily involved open-ended questions on a variety of broad philosophical, cultural, and historical topics. The in-depth interviews were regarded as a complement to the statistical data obtained in the closed-ended survey of the Japanese public. More than 300 people were recommended as possi- ble in-depth interview respondents. Recommendations were obtained from scholars and government officials in Japan and the United States. Final respondent selection was based on the quality of the recommendation and diversity of interest and professional background. Per- sons selected included scholars, scientists, government officials, conservationists, film-makers, religious figures, journalists, foresters, and wildlife managers. Two bilin- gual Japanese research assistants assisted in the in-depth interviews. The following topics were covered in the in-depth interviews: Japanese appreciation and concern for na- ture; attitudes toward pollution and its control; attitudes toward the conservation of wildlife and biological diver- sity; conflicts between economic development and con- servation; historical shifts in Japanese attitudes toward nature; the meaning and importance of Japanese tradi- tions such as rock gardening, flower arranging, the tea ceremony, bonsai, haiku, etc.; the meaning and influ- ence of Shinto and Buddhism on Japanese attitudes to- ward nature; attitudes toward plants versus animals; na- ture-related television viewing and reading; and national park use and perception. Basic Attitude and Knowledge Results As previously described, scales were constructed to measure basic attitudes and knowledge about animals and nature among the Japanese public. Figure 1 pro- vides a graphic depiction of the relative strength of basic attitudes toward wildlife and nature in Japan and the United States. These results indicate that the most prevalent attitude among the Japanese respondents was the humanistic. This finding suggests that strong emotional attachments to particular aspects of the environment or to single species were quite common among the Japanese public. Despite this finding, the negativistic attitude was also frequently encountered, intimating a more generalized indifference toward natural features or species not in- cluded among the group of especially preferred aspects of nature. The likelihood of this indifference was also suggested by the relatively low ecologistic scale scores among the Japanese public. Naturalistic attitude scale scores were relatively high, ATTITUDES IN JAPAN AND U.S.A. Negativistic _ m Utilitarian _ .. .. - -------------------------fl U.S.A.

The dominionistic attitude was even more prevalent, suggesting that direct experience with nature was most valued in situations involving consid- erable control within strict definitional boundaries or limits. This perspective was also emphasized in the in- depth interviews, as will be described. Utilitarian attitude scores were moderately evident, implying a pragmatic perspective toward the utilization of animals and nature. Comparatively low moralistic and ecologistic scores suggested only a modest willingness to limit the exploitation of nature based on ethical or ecological considerations. Figure 1 also offers comparisons between Japanese and Americans regarding basic attitudes toward wildlife and nature. Japanese and American respondents ob- tained a similar pattern of scores on the humanistic, utilitarian, negativistic, and naturalistic attitude dimen- sions. Both cultures appeared to evince strong appreci- ation and affection for particularly favored species or natural objects, in addition to enjoying direct experien- tial contact with these aspects of the environment. Both the Japanese and American publics were similarly prag- matic toward nature, and somewhat indifferent to as- pects of the environment that possessed little emo- tional, cultural, or historical value. Considerable differences were also apparent when the patterns of attitude scores between the two nation samples were compared. The American public ex- pressed a much stronger ethical and ecological perspec- tive of nature and wildlife than the Japanese. Moralistic differences were especially evident, suggesting a far more pronounced concern among the American than the Japanese public regarding the ethical treatment of animals and nature. Relative ecologistic differences also intimated a greater recognition of conservation values in the United States than in Japan. Very substantial differences occurred on the domin- ionistic attitude scale. The Japanese public appeared to Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="6">302 Japanese Perceptions of Wildife Kellert place far greater comparative value than the American public on satisfactions derived from control and mastery over nature. Relatively high humanistic scores, as well as information derived from the in-depth interviews, sug- gested that the Japanese public particularly emphasized the dominance of nature in situations involving consid- erable aesthetic and emotional appeal. Major differences also occurred among the Japanese and American publics regarding knowledge of animals, the Japanese obtaining lower knowledge scale scores. Knowledge differences are illustrated by the question results of Table 2. American respondents exhibited a greater knowledge of basic biological characteristics, while the Japanese tended to possess superior knowl- edge of animals with practical value. Additional information regarding Japanese attitudes toward nature and animals was obtained through the in-depth interviews. These results were remarkably con- sistent with the statistical data derived from the closed- ended survey of the Japanese public. Because this infor- mation is largely subjective, it is offered only as a complement to the more methodologically rigorous data derived from the survey of the Japanese public. Three outstanding attitudinal patterns emerged from the in-depth interviews. One prominent theme was a depiction of Japanese culture as placing greatest empha- sis on the experience and enjoyment of nature in very controlled, confined, and highly idealized circum- stances. This orientation to nature was described as par- ticularly pronounced in relation to certain species of plants and animals, especially valued landscapes, and in the practice of certain cultural traditions such as bonsai, rock gardening, flower arranging, the tea ceremony, etc. In these situations, the importance of control, struc- ture, and definition were stressed. The objective, as one respondent described, was to capture the presumed "essence" of a natural object, often by adherence to strict rules of "seeing and experiencing" intended to best express the centrally valued aspect of nature. Rarely did this admiration go beyond single species or isolated landscapes to an appreciation of nature in gen- eral or of broad ecological processes. Environmental Table 2. Selected knowledge questions (% correct).

This restricted Japanese appreciation of nature was described as largely emotional and aesthetic; little ana- lytical or biological consideration was involved. One respondent referred to it as a "love of semi-nature," somewhat domesticated and tamed; a desire to "use the materials of semi-nature to express human feelings." An- other respondent described this attitude as reflecting a Japanese preference for the artificial, highly abstract, and symbolic rather than the realistic experience of na- ture, a motivation to "touch" nature but from a con- trolled and safe distance. In a metaphorical sense, one respondent depicted this perspective as a Japanese will- ingness "to go to the edge of the forest, to view nature from across the river, to see natural beauty from a mountain top, but rarely to enter into or immerse one- self in wildness or the ecological understanding of nat- ural settings." One respondent described a Japanese "love" not so much of nature but rather of the artistic and symbolic experience of nature. This tendency, according to an- other respondent, largely reflected a desire to isolate favored aspects of the natural environment and then "freeze and put walls around it." This highly restricted and segmented appreciation of nature was thought often to result in an "antagonistic consciousness toward wild nature." A second attitudinal theme prominent in the in-depth interviews was a depiction of the Japanese people as being very subjective and personalized in their identifi- cation with nature. This orientation was thought to re- flect a limited capacity or desire to separate or distin- guish oneself from nature. This tendency was described as a relatively undeveloped analytical or empirical ap- preciation of animals and the environment. Most Japa- nese were thought to possess limited awareness of the scientific or ecological value of nature, a finding consis- tent with the ecologistic and knowledge scale results. A third attitudinal theme emphasized in the in-depth interviews was a view of the Japanese people as lacking an ethical orientation to conserve nature or scientifi- cally manage it. One respondent suggested that the Jap- anese inclination to identify closely with nature encour- aged an assumption that people could not knowingly harm nature because such an act would constitute an illogical desire to injure oneself. Various respondents described the Japanese as regarding nature as so supe- rior and powerful in relation to people that humans could not have much impact on the environment, let alone possess the capacity to manage it. As one respon- dent described it, "if wild nature is beyond the human ability to control or grasp, if people are fundamentally inconsequential before an all-powerful nature, then one could hardly imagine people as being able to exert Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="7">Kellert Japanese Perceptions of Wildlife 303 much harm or regulation over nature." Another respon- dent suggested, "people have to objectify nature, almost be arrogant toward it, to feel any particular ethical re- sponsibility or capacity for meddling with it." The Jap- anese tendency was depicted as viewing humans as both an insignificant part of nature, yet essentially "taken care of' by nature. Other Survey Results A variety of other statistical results were obtained from the survey of the Japanese public. Basic attitude and knowledge scales were analyzed among various demo- graphic groups, although limited space restricts this dis- cussion to age and educational comparisons. As Table 3 reveals, significant differences occurred amongJapanese educational groups on the naturalistic, negativistic, util- itarian, and knowledge scales. College-educated Japa- nese were significantly more interested, knowledgeable, and appreciative of nature and animals, and also substan- tially less exploitative, than Japanese of limited educa- tional attainment. This pattern also occurred in the United States, as indicated in Table 4. On the other hand, major differences occurred among the Japanese and Americans on the moralistic, ecologis- tic, and dominionistic attitude scales. College-educated Americans expressed far greater ecological and ethical concern for nature and animals, and were substantially less authoritarian in their views of nature, than Japanese of a similar educational level. In fact, the ecologistic and moralistic scores of college-educated Japanese were not significantly different from those of other educational groups, a finding at considerable variance from that en- countered in the United States and Germany (Schulz 1985). A similar pattern emerged when comparing different age groups in Japan. Elderly Japanese obtained signifi- cantly higher scores on the negativistic, dominionistic, Table 3.

This pattern was similarly found in the United States. In both countries, compared to older respon- dents, young adults had greater knowledge and affection and less exploitative and hostile attitudes toward ani- mals and nature. On the other hand, insignificant differences occurred among Japanese age groups on the moralistic and ecol- ogistic attitude scales, quite unlike results obtained in the United States and Germany. Substantially less eco- logical and ethical concern for nature and wildlife was found among Japanese of all age and educational groups, in considerable contrast to that encountered in the American and German surveys. Various questions were asked regarding the conser- vation and use of wildlife and natural habitats. Space limitations preclude more than a brief examination of these results. When confronted with the possibility of building a new industrial plant that could destroy a wetland and endanger a bird species, a majority of the Japanese pub- lic approved of the project while 38% of the American sample objected. A similar result occurred when the question concerned paying higher prices for tuna fish to reduce the killing of porpoises in fishermen's nets. Sev- enty percent of the American public indicated a willing- ness to pay the higher tuna prices, while only 38% of the Japanese public agreed. Japanese and American responses were quite similar, however, regarding the prospect of increased energy development costs to protect varying endangered spe- cies. A majority of the Japanese and American publics approved of increased energy costs to protect endan- gered bird, mammal, herpetological, fish, and butterfly species. A majority of the Japanese, in contrast to only one-third of Americans, supported protecting an endan- gered spider species. Japanese and American responses were also similar on a question regarding water development projects that might endanger an unspecified fish species. A majority of the publics in both countries supported the water development projects if relatively significant human benefits were provided such as increased drinking sup- plies, agricultural irrigation, or production of hydroelec- tric energy. Only a minority of the Japanese and Amer- ican publics approved of cooling industrial plant machinery or creating a lake for recreational purposes if it endangered a fish species. Both the Japanese and American publics were ques- tioned regarding the reasons for species endangerment during the past 25 years. Both samples cited chemical and industrial pollution as a very important reason for species endangerment, although nearly 50% of the Jap- anese sample compared to 32% of the Americans sup- ported this view.

The Japanese were far more inclined ( 16% ) than the American sample (6% ) to regard excess hunting and trapping as a contemporary extinction threat. In both countries, only small numbers (1-3%) recognized the importance of introduced or exotic spe- cies as a major reason for species endangerment. Questions were asked regarding hunting and fishing activities, as well as attitudes toward hunting. The Jap- anese participated far less than did the Americans in hunting (24% v. 8% ) or fishing (44% v. 26% ) activities. In addition, the Japanese public expressed far more dis- approval of hunting than did the American sample. The Japanese but not the American public reported on the purchase of various wildlife products during a previous 5-year period. More than 90% of the Japanese public reported they had not purchased 6 of 11 wildlife products. Between 11 and 15% indicated they had pur- chased ivory, tortoise shell, furs, and 'Yomeishu" (a folk medicine partially made from wild animal parts). The most frequently purchased wildlife product was whale meat. Forty-six percent of the Japanese public reported purchasing whale meat at least once during a 5-year period, while more than one-quarter reported purchas- ing whale meat more than four times. The nonconsumptive use of wildlife and nature was also explored. Eight percent of the Japanese public re- ported bird-watching during a 2-year period, compared to 25% in the United States. Both the Japanese and American publics reported only a limited bird identifi- cation ability, with a majority unable to identify more than 10 species, and just 3.2% of the American and 1.7% of the Japanese publics recognizing more than 40 bird species. A far greater proportion of Americans than Japanese owned a pet. More than 40% of the publics in both countries reported visiting a zoo at least once during a 2-year period. More than four-fifths of the Japanese and American publics had watched a wildlife-related televi- sion show during a 2-year period. Far smaller propor- tions reported membership in a conservation-related or- ganization, especially among the Japanese, with 11 % of the American sample and only 1% of the Japanese re- porting membership in one or more environmental or wildlife-related organizations. The Japanese and American publics were also ques- tioned regarding perceived knowledge of various wild- life and environmental issues. In Japan, these issues in- cluded the whaling controversy, protection of the Japanese Crested Ibis, threats to the Okinawa coral reef, agricultural and forestry damage inflicted by the Ka- moshika (an endemic goatlike animal), the impact of pesticides on birds, the creation of a wildlife sanctuary on Iriomote island, and hunting baby seals for their fur. In the United States, the issues included killing baby seals for their fur, the impact of pesticides on birds, using leg-hold traps, the Endangered Species Act, coyote damage to livestock, the tuna-porpoise controversy, the TVA-snail darter controversy, and use of lead versus steel shot. Only one-third or less of the Japanese public reported a very good to moderate knowledge of any of the issues. A larger proportion of Americans reported this level of knowledge, although no issue was highly recognized by a majority of the American public. The most widely rec- ognized issues in both countries focused on single spe- cies, humane considerations, or human health hazards. The least recognized issues, especially inJapan, involved habitat-related impacts on wildlife. Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="9">Kellert Japanese Perceptions of Wildlife 305 Discussion and Conclusions The study's quantitative and qualitative findings failed to confirm an especially prominent "Japanese love and rev- erence for nature" (Mariani 1971:19), a "relationship between nature and the Japanese people ... based on a feeling of awe and respect ... in harmony with an un- derstanding of nature's totality" (Higuchi 1979:22;13). The results did reveal a Japanese appreciation for nature and wildlife, although typically expressed in a very lim- ited, often idealized and restricted fashion. Japanese ad- miration of nature was largely confined to particular aspects of the environment or to single species, fre- quently admired in a context emphasizing control, ma- nipulation, and considerable contrivance. This affinity for natural objects was often expressed as an idealistic re-creation or artistic rendering of particu- larly valued environmental attributes. This appreciation of nature involved considerable abstraction, emphasiz- ing a concept of "perfection" derived from following prescribed rules and assumptions concerning harmony, order, and logic. One respondent characterized this ad- miration as largely "a tradition of 'stealing' aspects of nature and creating an art form around it." Richie ( 1971:13) made a similar argument: "The Japanese atti- tude toward nature is essentially possessive. Indeed, na- ture is not natural at all until the hand of man ... has properly shaped it ... An ideal is created, beauty is born, precisely because it has been defined." Grapard (1985:243) remarked, "What has been termed the 'Jap- anese love of nature' is actually the Japanese love of cultural transformations ... of a world which, if left alone, simply decays." The results of this study similarly indicated a Japanese appreciation of nature often lacking an ecological or ethical orientation, or a strong sense of responsibility to conserve or protect the natural environment (Iwata 1977; Yoshii 1982; McKean 1981; McLen et al. 1979; Numata 1986). The Japanese nature-oriented traditions of bonsai, flower-arranging, and rock-gardening were typically divorced from issues of ecological function; in many ways, as one respondent described, they were "more like having a 'pet' with no idea of the basis of production, no understanding of these natural objects in a complete life cycle or an ecological sense." Taylor ( 1990:5) described these traditions as emerging from an assumption that "wilderness ... has a true nature which coincides with an ideal form ... In this sense, the Japa- nese cultivation of nature can be ruthless toward raw wilderness." Saito (1983:192) further argued that the Japanese appreciation of nature is largely escapist and indifferent to conservation: "Nature is not lived or re- spected for its own sake but because it allows one to escape ... This appreciation of nature not only implies an anthropocentric attitude toward nature, but also sug- gests [an] ineffectiveness in generating an ethically de- sirable justification for protecting nature." These results are consistent with the findings of other surveys, which have indicated only limited Japanese in- terest in directly experiencing wilderness or nature un- related to man. When asked in a national survey where they would prefer to visit on a tour, less than 6% of the Japanese public, compared to 62% of the German and 48.5% of the Belgian publics, reported wanting to see a forest (Imanaga et al. 1984). When questioned whether they preferred "nature influenced by man" or "un- spoiled nature such as the virgin forests and wilds," 60% of the Japanese public chose the former, in contrast to a minority of the European sample (Shidei 1983). When asked their primary reason for visiting a national park, 47% of the Japanese public responded "to admire beau- tiful ... landscapes," 46% "to enjoy outdoor sports," and only 11 % "to observe the ecology of plants and animals" (Japan Environment Agency 1983). A study by the Jap- anese Prime Minister's Office (1986) reported that only 26% of the Japanese public believed "the reduction of wildlife species is a serious problem to worry about," compared to 42% among Western European respon- dents. Another survey of "14 countries by the United Nations Environmental Program rated the Japanese peo- ple lowest in environmental concern and awareness" (Japan Prime Minister's Office 1989:7). A restricted Jap- anese knowledge of the environment was also noted by Kamei (1983:24), who concluded: "Understanding of environmental issues [in Japan] is at a very low level ... Ignorance of even the most basic concepts of man's relationship to nature or the importance of ... conserv- ing resources extends through every level of society." Usuki similarly remarked (Sneider 1989), "Public [envi- ronmental] awareness in Japan is at the stage of a devel- oping country." Studies by McKean (1981) and Pierce et al. (1986) suggested that environmental concern among the Japa- nese public largely focused on local issues and was far more oriented toward pollution and human health con- cerns than toward the preservation and protection of the natural environment. Similar findings were also re- ported by Upham (1976) and Gressler et al. (1981). Research by Kelly et al. (1976) concluded that the Jap- anese political system was unlikely to produce a pow- erful environmental movement at the national level. These various findings collectively offer some addi- tional insight regarding Japan's relatively poor record of national and international environmental conservation. As Sneider (1989) noted, "Japan is under increasing scrutiny for what critics portray as a pattern of insensi- tivity to global environmental problems." Japan has been particularly criticized for its role in tropical rain forest destruction, ivory consumption, whaling, drift-net fishing, wildlife product imports, and other areas of environmental impact. Japan only recently enacted na- Conservation Biology Volume 5, No. 3, September 1991</page><page sequence="10">306 Japanese Perceptions of Wildlife Kellert tional legislation to protect endangered wildlife, and the country lacks an adequate process for environmental impact assessment of development-oriented projects Japan Environment Agency 1985, 1989). This study must, therefore, conclude that only a lim- ited Japanese appreciation of nature and wildlife has been identified, and then in a typically narrow emo- tional, ecological, and intellectual context focusing on single species or aesthetically significant individual nat- ural objects. This conclusion does not suggest that strong affection for especially valued aspects of nature is unimportant. History has repeatedly demonstrated that an emphasis on single species and natural objects can be a critical basis for an evolving concern for nature conser- vation and protection (Matthiessen 1987; Dunlap 1988). Effective management and protection of the planet's biological diversity will depend, however, on moving beyond a narrow emphasis on the aesthetically and emotionally attractive to a broader recognition of na- ture's value and significance to the human condition. The results of this study suggest that the Japanese, as well as the American, publics have remained largely aloof from the biological matrix of "lower" life forms and the ecological processes that support them. Only recently has Japan or the United States begun to ques- tion assumptions of human superiority and dominance over nature, and then mostly in expressions of sympathy for the downtrodden or affection for the culturally ap- pealing. Effective environmental policies are unlikely to occur in either country until the public becomes broadly convinced of the intrinsic value of nature and its relation to a meaningful quality of life. The attitudes of both Japanese and Americans will be critical in the evolutionary development of a global con- sciousness of ecological concern and respect for nature. These countries exert tremendous influence on the in- ternational community both as vast exploiters of nature and as models of social and economic development. Ja- pan and the United States possess extraordinary oppor- tunities to establish a standard that moves the world from its current excessive exploitation of nature to a more sustainable basis of ecosystem health and stability. Both nations should lead in recognizing how harmful environmental practices represent both material and, ultimately, spiritual deficits. As one respondent re- marked upon the conclusion of the final interview con- ducted in Japan: "In the future, we must turn to a more spiritual-what we Japanese call 'kokoro' [Ono 1982]- basis for life. We need to conserve nature not just to preserve ecosystems, but to save our 'kokoro,' to reduce our hurt. The crisis we face is not just the extinction of species but the need to save our human spirit." Literature Cited Anesaki, M. 1932. Art, life and nature in Japan. Charles E.
