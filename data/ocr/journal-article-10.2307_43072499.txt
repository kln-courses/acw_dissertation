<plain_text><page sequence="1">207 Mesopotamia!! Mythology 1 A. Leo Oppenheim - New York The following notes deal with the epical literature in cuneiform and are meant to prepare, in many respects, a reconsideration and even a reinterpretation of certain crucial and obscure passages. They are based upon a definitely personal approach which attempts to com- bine literary criticism with philological detail-research. The notes are divided into three sections: I) Enûma Eliš, the Epic of Creation; II) the Epic of Gilgamesh; III) the balance of the pertinent Akkadian literature. Each note is numbered and refer- ence will be made to these numbers throughout the study. The Epic of Creation is quoted according to the edition of Labat (R. Labat, Le poeme babylonien de la création , Paris 1935) (4); the Epic of Gil- gamesh according to R. C. Thompson's monumental work. The editions used for the other texts will be indicated. 1 - En. El. I: 1-9. The flow of the initial verses of the poem is interrupted by line 6. " The shrubs (in the marshes) were not (yet) densely grown together, even the canebrakes were not (yet) visible We have to omit this verse as a clumsy addition of a redactor who inserted here a line taken from the well-known type of Sumerian " Myths of Ori- gin " in which the primaeval chaos is wordily described. Thus the proem runs as follows: 1 Before, above, heaven existed (and), 2 below, earth came into being (4) The most recent English translation of this text, A. Heidel's The Babylonian Genesis , The Story of the Creation, Chicago 1942, has been util- ized only as far as it contains new interpretations, novel emendations, etc .

[Apsu and Tiamat). The distich 7 and 8 seems to have been interpolated by a the- ological minded editor alluding here to the division within the world of the gods, between those born or otherwise brought into existence {cf. no. 2) by Tiamat, and those who were to be the offspring of the couple Anšar and Kišar. 2 - En. El. 1:10-16. Against the communis opinio I am inclined to contend that two sets of divine twins were the outcome of the above mentioned union of Apsu and Tiamat. I do not consider Ansar and Kišar as the generation following Lahmu and Lahamu, but as that borne by Tiamat after the first couple proved to be a failure. The first twins were not anthropomorphic in appearance (8) and lacked, above all, the faculty of procreation. This clearly follows from the description of the next generation (Anšar and Kišar) which the text expressly cha- racterizes as eli-su-nu at-ru 4 'more highly developed than they". The poet repeatedly stresses the factt hat the gods Anšar, Kišar, Anu and Nudimmud belong to the same evolutionary level, by using such terms as šāninu " equal ", tamHlu 44 replica " and muššulu 14 to create a likeness ", in contradistinction to banû IV " to be born", wapu III " to make come forth ", which refer to the birth of the direct off- spring of Tiamat.

Acc. p. 140:352) and " to cont(r)act ", the poem refers here probably to the concept of an originally lasting sexual union between the male and the female constituents of the primaeval world which only the new-born Light-god interrupts.

Mythology I 209 The fact that other passages {cf. e . g . En. El. III : 4) do consider Laternu and Lāpāmu to be the ancestors of the dei superi does not disprove my interpretation of these verses. The poem is often condensed from divergent traditions which schools of priestly editors have fused into the preserved text. Lines 11 and 13 of the verses translated below offer a case in point by bearing out cosmological speculations centering around the motifs of slow evolution and of extensive spaces of time in a context of an entirely different ideological background. 10 Laķmu (and) Lahamu were brought forth, came into being; 11 after long ages had elapsed, 13 (4) (after) many days and long years, 1 2 Anšar and Kišar were born, more highly developed than these ; 14 their son (was) Anu - an equal to his parents - 15 (because) Anšar created Anu, his first-born son, after his own [image. 16 Anu (in turn) created (again) a replica of himself: Nudimmud ! Here the evolution conies to an end. After failures and slow developments, the stage is set for the mythological play. All the actors are divine beings of the same level. Only niagic means can increase their individual powers. 3 - En. El. 1:21-28. A hymnical interlude in praise of Ea (lines 17-20) is followed by the description of the first conflict arising in this young world. The epic is strangely evasive as to the reason underlying the tension between the " bands of young gods and their parents (/. e. Apsu, and Tiamat) in the silent darkness of the abyss. The poet wishes us to believe that their " noisy " life caused the fateful wrath of Apsu, disturbed in his sleep. Yet, in the last line of his description he gives away the story which he wanted to suppress: 21 The young gods banded together, 22 their unruly behaviour disturbed even Tiamat (2), (*) The proposed interchanging of verses seems to be required by the context. For the idiomatic expression involved cf. the parallel passage in Sargon II, KB II p. 44 : 38. (*) I propose to read na-mus-su-nu is-tab-bu , connecting namussû {cf. Th. Bauer, Assurbanípal II p. 1 to namussû alâkú ) with namâsu "to go " Orientalia - 14</page><page sequence="4">210 A. Leo Oppenheim 23 (4) confused indeed was Tiamaťs mind (by their doings). 24 Whirling through the " Heavenly Mansions " 25 the noise they made could even be heard (lit. : did not diminish [as far away as) in the abyss ! 26 While Tiamat was acquiescent towards their [behaviour] 27 their doings were greatly annoying to [Apsu] - 28 (because) their actions were not decent any more since they had [reached sexual maturity ! (*) This last and tell-tale verse immediately evokes the age-old and world-wide story of primaeval incest so crassly exemplified e . g . in the Greek myth of Kronos, Rhea and Zeus. The poet, child of a more advanced age, rejects the tale about the radiant young god in incestual relations with his mother, its inevitable sequel of patri- cide, and the eventual apotheosis of the murderer, founder of a new world-order, who slaughters the old and hostile gods or im- prisons them in abysmal regions. Not only did he substitute the motif of " noise " (8) for that of incest, but he attempts also to hide the individuality of the main actor - and we have every reason to assume that Ea was the lover of Tiamat - behind the anonymous plurality of the expression at-ķu-ū ilânini (line 21). {cf. Meissner MAOG 111/3 p. 26) and translating sabâbu (against v. Soden ZA XLI p. 171 note 3 sapâpu = alâku) by " to twitch, jerk, flash". The specific implications of this phrase remain obscure though it is rather clear that some noisy if not flashing activity was referred to. With regard to certain indications, discussed in the note 2, saòâbu could refer to optical rather than to acoustic phenomena. (*) A more exacting critical attitude could easily declare this verse a spurious addition.

Cf. furthermore Jacobsen in JNES IV, p. 167, note 125. (3) The substitution of " noise " for sinful doings occurs also in the myth of Irra (Ebeling, Der akkadische Mythus vom Pestgott Era p. 4) KAR 168 : 39 and Luckenbill AJSL 39, p. 154 : 4-8 (" Atrahasis % Note also that the religious lyric in Mesopotamia effectfully contrasts the noisy activities of mankind with the silent glory of the heavens (cf. the famous " Prière aux Dieux de la nuit 99 and similar passages).</page><page sequence="5">Mesopotamia!!

When Apsu complained, clumsily and with insistence (*), about his sleeplessness, asking permission from Tiamat to u exterminate " (Jjtûlâqu III/II is here term . techn .) the noisemakers, the mother of the gods reacts violently and forbids Apsu in no uncertain terms to interfere. Then a new actor appears on the scene : Mummu, the crafty adviser of the perplexed Apsu. Using a sophisticated technical trick - our poet masters all the devices of his calling - the author chooses not to inform us concerning the " plan of Mummu ", a plan obviously conceived to circumvent the command of Tiamat and tc end definitively the trib- ulations of Apsu. He prefers to describe elaborately the triumphant joy of Apsu when he listens to Mummu, and the pathetic conster- nation of the gods when 44 somebody " gives them intelligence ( us - tan-nu-ni , line 56) of this plan. It is clear that Tiamat herself has warned her lover, an incident which the censorship of our author could not admit into the text. The dreaded attack, of still undis- closed nature, induces Ea to adopt countermeasures which the lines 61-65 describe in a very condensed manner. My translation of these crucial verses runs as follows: 61 He (Ea) invented and manufactured against him (Apsu) a (magic [called) usrat kali (2), 62 making it cunningly so (strong) that its sacred conjuration- (power) [was superior to (the magic used by) him (Apsu) ; 63 he (then) recited it and (thus) transferred it(s power) into water, 64 and he poured this (magic) sleep(ing-draught) over him (Apsu) [while he was sleeping in a cavern, 65 thus lulling Apsu into a (magic) sleep, he (who himself planned [to) pour (over Ea) this sleep(ing-draught) ! Thus, finally, the plan of Mummu is divulged. The cunning vizier had advised Apsu to eliminate Ea, son, rival and " noise-maker ", (4) Elîtam zakâru " to speak with raised voice " (cf. elîtam sasû with a similar meaning in III : 125), in contradistinction to the idiom iaplâti tamii ° to speak with a low voice " (against Deimel ŠL Vol. I no. 33/5). (f) These words remain a crux. For usurtu , denoting an object used by the conjuration priest, cf. e. g. Thompson, Evil Spirits I p. 22 : 210. Ea obviously creates here a specific type of conjuration-technique which his adepts continue to apply : ú-su-rat AÊ-a.</page><page sequence="6">212 A. Leo Oppenheim by means of a magic soporific (šitiu" sleep" and "sleeping-draught") (*), without killing him. Yet, this plan does not account fully for the consternation of, the gods (lines 57-58) when they learned about it. The circumstantial description oí their despair indicates that their very existence was jeopardized by the plan of Mummu. As a pos- sible explanation I would like to refer to the fact that - as other mythological texts inform us - the " Water of Life", stored in the Netherworld, was indispensable for the vitality, even the existence of the gods. It is therefore not unlikely that Mummu's plan was to drug this precious water which the gods could net dispense with without endangering their lives. In his fatal sleep, Apsu is robbed by Ea of the two insignia of kingship : mantle (*) and tiara (lines 67-68). After taking the meiam - mû (3) away from his foe, Ea assumes the supernatural radiance be- fitting the ruler of the universe. This robust mythological interlude with its contest of magic powers is duly concluded by the slaying of the Old Man, while the punishment meted out to his adviser remains somewhat obscure. From lines 72 and 117 it might be inferred that Mummu was not killed on the spot but held on a nose-rope by the triumphant Ea. Line 66, however, remains a crux. It would fit perfectly into the mythological pattern if we could interpret this line as referring to a castration of Mummu, as a substitution of an original castration of Apsu. On the other hand, if the words da-la-piš ku-û-ru could be translated as " too short to run (with) and taken as describing the legs of a Mummu conceived as a dwarf, it would perhaps explain the peculiar way in which Apsu expressed his gratitude for Mummu's clever advice (lines 53-55). He placed him on his lap in order to kiss him. Under these circumstances, the well-known figure of the bowlegged and ithyphallic dwarf (4) on Near-Eastern ( 1 ) For the connexion between si¡uttu and rehû cf. also K 3650 II : 2 published in ZA 4 p. 33 (p. 9 transliteration).

El. 1:71-78. The verses which describe the triumph of Ea are definitely in disorder. Two versions can easily be separated : 73 After he had put his adversaries in fetters and was standing (as [victor) on the(ir) necks, 74 Ea erected a monument (commemorating) his triumph over his [enemies (2), 75 and (then) rested in his cella in order to repose, and: 69 He fettered Apsu and slew him, 70 he bound Mummu, laying him crosswise over him (Apsu) ; 71 then he established his seat upon the Abyss (&lt; apsu ) 76 and he called this (place) Apsu, declaring it a sanctuary. official of high rank in S. Smith, 1st Campaign of Sennacherib, line 33, as mu- nammir têm rubàiièu " who entertains his lordship and the passage Budge- King AAA p. 388 f. (Luckenbill AR I § 63) referring to the scribe of an As- syrian king with the words : mu-ti-ib lib-bi bêli-sú (line 4) " who enter- tains his lord Again, the implications of this phrase escape us. It is not likely to denote a specific rank or position in court because it occurs too rarely but we might hazard the guess that it referred to court-jesters or the like. In favour of such an interpretation is the fact that dwarfs (dancing and playing musical instruments) were used for the entertainment of the Egyptian kings and that the Akkadian word for dwarf ( tigru , cf. Jastrow, Religion II, p. 317, note 7, p. 914, note 1, Holma, Quttulu, p. 90) seems to be con- nected with Egypt. dngt which again is a loan-word from the Ethiopie. Thus these entertaining pygmies seem to have been exported from Central Africa as far as Mesopotamia. ( 1 ) For the more spiritualized aspect of this strange and interesting figure, I refer to the articles of F. M. Th. Böhl (Mummu = Logos) in OLZ 1916 p. 265 if. St. Langdon ( The Babylonian Conception of the Logos) in J RAS 1919, p. 433 if, and of W. F. Albright ( The supposed. Babylonian deriv- ation of the Logos) in the Journal of Bibl. Literature 19?0, p. 143 ff. (2) The use of the nose-rope, the erection of a stele with triumphal inscriptions ( irnittu ), the typical gesture of the victor (sip-ka sa-ad nakri in CT XX pl. 39 II : 12) bespeak a concept of warfare which is well texem- plified in Mesopotamia in the literature and the iconography of the Akkad- period.</page><page sequence="8">214 A. Leo Oppenneim ! 77 There he erected a " Holy Grove " for himself 78 and Ea and Damkina celebrated (lit. : sat down) (therein) in ma- jesty the Sacred Marriage ! This festival terminates the Ea story. In the outdoor sanctuary , of the giparu (4) the new world-era is inaugurated by a solemn co- habitation which is to yield the sun-god and future ruler of the world (*). The above proposed dissection of the verses 69-78 has discarded the line 72, describing Ea as holding Mummu by a nose-rope, be- cause it seems out of place in both versions which our poet was not able to fuse into a harmonious unit. From the literary point of view, it should be noted that the Ea story as told in Enûma Eliš in its condensed form is basilically a doublette of the Marduk story. It is used, however, very skill- fully by the poet as an overture which touches briefly upon the main " Leitmotifs " and thus instills curiosity, and prepares the listener for what is to come. 6 - En. El. 1:87-100. The Marduk-story too has a hymnical introit (cf. lines I: 17-20 of the Ea story) which underlines the fact that this god was born " in the destined sanctuary, the (pre)determined abode " (line 79). Begotten by a god, borne by a goddess, this child takes in additional divine power through his heavenly wetnurses (line 86) a fact which is in line with concepts reflected in Sumerian and Assyrian historical in- scriptions. 87 His figure was luxuriant, sparkling the glance of his eyes ; 88 mature the moment he was born, he was able to beget from the [very beginning (of his existence). When this child, precocity is a typical feature of the " sun-god was presented to his father, probably following an age-old custom (4) This giparu (Sum. g i p a r) (cf. S. Smith, Babyl. Hist .

Koschaker p. 175 f.) has to be differen- tiated from the giparu in line 6 (cf. no. 1) though both shades of meaning go back to the same basic word which denotes a shadowy grove.

Some erratic verses mar the flow of this description. Line 95 " four eyes he had, four ears he had " is either a doublette or an awkward anticipation of verses 97-98, while line 96 4 * when speaking his lips blew forth fire 99 seems to be taken from a descrip- tion of a different tenor. It is evident that our poet understood the double godhead 99 bestowed upon Marduk by his father Ea in a rather rationalistic manner i. e. as manifested in the two faces of the god (#) as well as in the doubled dimensions of his figure. This interpretation of the phenomenon of magically intensified " divine power " (3) is very re- vealing for the spiritual background of the poet. A different ex- planation for the same phenomenon is given in the Epic of Gilga- mesh and I intend to discuss the problem involved in the second part of these notes (no. 23).

For a " doubled godhead" cf. also KAR IV 168 : 21 šu-un-na-[at i]lu-su-un. (3) The tenfold melammù of Marduk mentioned in line 103 reflects a different tradition.

Bad preservation of the text and the use of cryptic and allusive language conceals the reasons given by the poet for the conflict arising between young Marduk and Tiamat. The incest-motif is clearly abandoned and the redactor or compiler is apparently obliged to invent a motivation which the following verses must have contained : 105 [leading on a leash?] the four winds (which) Anu had created, 106 he curbs the griffin - the leader of the pack - 107 and he did [ ] in order to disturb Tiamat (*)♦ 108 Tiamat indeed was disturbed, she became restless day and night. 109 The [lesser gods, or : the brothers of Marduk] with bad inten- sions acted in an evil way 110 and conceived a plot. The incompletely preserved text cannot inform us about the activities of Marduk and his boisterous host which again disturbed the abysmal quiet in which Tiamat was living. It is not unlikely that the term " noise " is again used as a substitute for a specific misdeed of the young god which the pious poet refused to mention in his work. The hatred of the gods against the youngster Marduk may be taken to indicate that ambition and perhaps even an at- tempted rebellion (against Anu's authority) was the crime of Marduk. A line in the second tablet {cf no. 10) will show - according to my interpretation - that stern action on the part of Anu against his teriipestuous grandchild was once necessary to maintain the status quo in the world of the gods, an incident for which obvious parallels may be found in many mythologies. The plea of the jealous brothers to Tiamat is reported in these verses : 1 1 1 They, the brothers, said to Tiamat : 112 "When they killed Apsu, your mate, 113 " you did not help him but you stood silently aside! 114 "Although he (Apsu) had built the terrible šasšaru- weapon (J) The presens ü-dal-lah requires the offered translation.

Here, allusion is made to mythological stories which remain, unfortunately, obscure. Did Apsu create this peculiar weapon to penetrate into the 44 Heavenly Mansions " surrounded by a wait of flame (cf no. 8), just as Shamash used the 44 saw " every morning to penetrate the glow of the dawn ? Far more important, however, than such shreds of lost myths, is the fact that our verse records a dif- ferent version of the Ea story, a version in which Apsu patently had a more 44 heroic " role than in that which the Enûma Elis hap- pened to preserve.

The secession of the gods (line 128 " they separated them- selves (4) and sided with Tiamat ") and the creation of a demonic host by Tiamat precede the decisive revolutionary act, the elevation of one of the rebel gods, Kingu, to leadership. His offices are specified in lines 148-150: leader of the army, captain of the levy, standard- bearer of the melée who gives the sign for the attack, battle-master and booty-warden (?) (2). In a solemn speech, Tiamat further enhances Kingu's position by handing over to him the " Charm of (Supreme) Power " which endows its carrier with magic omnipotence. This powerful amulet, a kind of tag, apparently to be fastened around the neck (cf. IV : 122) is, therefore, no " Tablet of Destinies " in the Epic of Creation or in other texts of this literary type. 152 "I (Tiamat) have given you magic power (tu) and an exalted [position in the assembly of the gods, 153 4 4 making you the counsellor (cf. line 151) of all the gods, 154 " (but now) you shall be elevated to a still higher rank : you [shall be my only mate ! 155 " Your orders shall prevail over (those of) all the (other) An- [nunaki !

" Thus endowed with supreme power Kingu hastens to give the signal for the attack. He pronounces this order in two verses (160- 161) which are rather difficult. In these two lines the remarkably skillfully composed first tablet reaches its culmination-point. The ef- fect of Kingu's order is circumstantially described in the next tablet, yet the order itself remains obscure : 1 58 When Kingu was thus exalted and had assumed the rank of Anu 159 he gave the (following) order to his divine sons : (l) To tnasâru "to draw a line".

Fire and noise are everywhere effective means of chasing demonic powers away. The command of the bearer of the " Charm of Supreme Power however, makes an end of both and the gods consider themselves lost. Their terrible danger is used by the poet to put Marduk's role as saviour in the greatest possible relief. 9 - En. El. 11:73-85. When it is reported to Ea, here patently in the role of a vizier of the gods, that " Tiamat has turned wicked in order to avenge Apsu " (line 3), he hastens to inform his father Anšar.

When Anšar then turns to his son Anu, he has changed his mind and now advocates appease- ment instead of battle : 73 " This is the [right man], the master of the heroes, 74 " whose power is [outstanding], whose attack cannot be checked ! 75 " (Now) [you go] and have an audience before Tiamat 76 4 4 that her mind may be [appeased], her wrath calmed down ! 77 " [li] she does not accept your submission (*) 78 " inform her of our [submission (2), (then) she certainly will be [appeased !

Again revealing the composite and complex character of this poem the quoted verses refer to a &lt;4 plan of Tiamat " (and of Kingu, cf.

Still, the poet does not divulge this " plan of Tiamat " but scattered indi- cations (cf. below lines 90-91) will yield some information, especially the elaborate battle-preparations of Marduk. In a sophisticated stylistic gradation of the. moods of the dei superi , their feelings after this renewed failure are again described.

Lines 90-91 sum up the situation : " None of the gods can penetrate to [Tiamat], (none) can escape alive who has to face her ! " 10 - En. El. 11:96-103, 1 17-129. From the very allusive indications of these lines, the startling fact results that an important episode of the early life of Marduk has been omitted by the censorship of the poet. Marduk apparently committed a deed which not only caused the hatred of his brothers (attempt to seize power?) but also forced himself into hiding before the wrath of Father Anšar. Ea seems to have been instrumental in protecting and hiding his too ambitious son in wise foresight of the emergency now at hand. Suddenly, in this moment of supreme crisis, Anšar a remem- bered " (line 93 'it'-ta-bil lib-ba-su-ma) (4) his grandchild and 96 he called for Marduk. Ea (then) went to his hiding place ( a-sar 'pi-ris-ti-su) 97 in order to inform him (Marduk) of a secret plan of his (Ea's) own 98 (saying) : 4&lt; Marduk, consider my advice, listen to your father ; 99 14 you alone, my son, are able to bring alleviation to his (Anšar's) [heart ! 100 " When you are with Ansar approach him (therefore) daringly 101 " and state your conditions ! (2) Take your stand before him [(without fear) he will be peaceful when he sees you. " Marduk apparently had good reasons to be afraid oí the inter- view with Ansar, and Ea patently tries to allay his apprehensions. The main purpose of this speech, however, is to advise his son to make the best use of the desperate situation of the gods. 102 The lord (Marduk) was happy over the advice of his father, 103 he approached (Ansar), took his stand before him. (4) For this idiom cf. my remarks in JAOS LXI p. 256 b. (2) Pâ epêsu has here a definite idiomatic meaning, while epus pi (noun) in VI : 33 means something like "idea, concept " and in II : 127, VI : 3 simply "command, utterance".</page><page sequence="16">222 A. Leo Oppenheim A lively dialogue ensues in which Ansar informs his grandson of the calamity. Marduk promises victory but Ansar still advocates a policy of appeasement : 117 " Calm [Tiamat] with your holy magic power; 118 "(but) proceed quickly down to her in the chariot (drawn) by [umu-stovms 119 "and do not tarry in her (dangerous) pre[sence], turn back [(quickly) ! " While Anšur thus attempts to protect his messenger, Marduk is far more interested in the reward he is to be fighting for than in the technique to be applied in the battle : 122 " Lord of the gods, (who has) Supreme Power over the great [gods ! 123 " if I shall be your avenger, 124 a(if) I shall tame Tiamat and (thus) save your life, 125 4 4 you must convoke the assembly (of all the gods, you must [pronounce my power supreme !) 126 " All of you must sit down - voluntarily - in the Upšukinakku 127 " (to decide) that (from now on) my command, instead of yours, [shall be all-powerful !

Anšar dispatches Gaga, his messenger, to convoke those gods who had no immediate knowledge of the calamity, their residences being too far away. He picks Gaga because the latter knows how to break gently bad news (lines 5-6 4&lt;Iam sending you . . . because you understand how to be ingratiating and you know (how) to speak "). Gaga's message was to end with the blank statement : (*) While simtu sámu or Hmat NN sámu means 44 to establish/deter- mine the simtu of a person or an object' ' with simtu denoting the totality of the specific qualities of an object, or of the rights of a person, we have in this verse a hendiadys: (w)atâru III plus nabû simtu.</page><page sequence="17">Mesopotamian Mythology I 223 53 " I (Anšar) have sent Anu but he could not face her, 54 " even Nudimmud (*. e.

Five separate acts of this ceremonial may be distinguish- ed : I) Marduk presides over the assembly, he 4&lt; faces " the gods (!)

The first 16 lines of the tablet contain a carefully worded three- point statement of the gods specifying the prerogatives of their " king a statement which sheds an interesting light on the political ideology of our poet : 1 They erected for him a dais (befitting) his overlordship, 2 facing his parents he took (there) his place as (their) ruler. 3 (They declared) : " You are (now) the most important among the great gods 4 " your power is without equal, your order (henceforth) Anu ! 7 (4) " From today (on) your command cannot be changed, 9 4&lt; the word you utter shall be final, your order infallible ! 8 " To promote and to demote (the other gods) is (henceforth) [within your power 10 " while none among them shall infringe upon your prerogatives ! 11 "(Where/whenever) the (re)decoration of a sanctuary is required [(by a divine oracle) (*) 12 " (there) shall (henceforth) be established a holy place for you [in their (the lesser gods') sanctuaries ! 13 " To you Marduk, our avenger, 14 "we have given (herewith) the rank of king oí all the universe, 15 " so that your word shall be decisive when you sit in the [assembly (of the gods) ! 16 " May your weapon never miss, may you smite your enemies ! " The following two lines (17-18 " Lord, spare the life of those who are loyal to you but put to death the gods who joined the evil (powers ! ") constitute probably a redactional addition (perhaps also line 16 as a transitional verse) anticipating the situation of the be- ginning of the sixth tablet. (4) The proposed change in the sequence of verses (after the repetition in lines 5-6) seems to be preferable to that of the tablet.

Here, they change from tribal chieftains electing a king in a period of emergency, to officials who can be promoted or demoted by an omnipotent monarch. They furthermore concede Marduk a place of worship in their own temples as an unequivocal expression of his sovereignty, with the rather technical restriction (smacking of compromise) that this provision should only go into effect in rebuilt sanctuaries. Thus they cease to be rulers within a more or less loosely connected confederation of tribes, to assume the position of governors in whose palaces the shrine dedicated to their overlord patently bespeaks the lost indépendance. How far these and similar passages in the epical literature reflect typical historical situations in certain regions of Mesopotamia remains to be investigated. Lines 33-34 still show the trend of thought which advo- cates appeasement of Tiamat instead of battle (" after his divine parents had transfered their (!) power to Bel they dispatched him on an errand of peaceful settlement ") (A), but the following description of Marduk's preparations for his attack clearly bespeak his true in- tentions. 13 - En. El. I V : 6 1 - 6 2 . For the attack on Tiamat, Marduk is equipped with quite an array of weapons, but only two will actually be used : the bow (line 36 " he topped (the arrow) with an arrow-head and attached the string (to the bow)") (2) and the net the purpose of which is described in the lines 41-44. " He made a net; to encompass Tiamat within it he stretched (it) in all four directions and posted close to the net the South-Wind, North-Wind, East-Wind (and) West-Wind, given to him by his father Anu, so that no part of her (serpent-shaped ?) body could protrude Among the weapons which Marduk was not actually to use in the impending battle we find the miffu- pike (for his right hand) and the abûbu- mace.

Leo Oppenheim and the flaring flames with which he filled his body (line 40), as well as the puhiķtu- mailcoat and the awe-inspiring melammû on his head, are not simply defensive in purpose, they endow Marduk with additional divine power which the religious concept of the ancient Near East visualized in brilliancy, fire and flames. Lines 61-62 reveal, however, that Marduk used still other, magical, means to enhance his " élan vitale "mana- power", etc . : ' 61 On [his] lips are drawn (*) [magic ornaments?] with red paste 62 (and) in his hand he is holding the (i Plant " to annihilate the [(deadly mephitic) smell. These preparations clearly show that Marduk is planning a de- scensus ad inferos, to fight Tiamat in her realm, the Netherworld. This is so dangerous a venture, even for a god, that he is obliged to resort to the use of the most primitive magic known in the history of mankind. He paints his face with lines in life-carrying red (2). The meaning of the second line (62) is illustrated by a parallel epi- sode in the Sumerian account of Ish tar's descent to the Netherworld (cf. S. N. Kramer, Sumerian Mythology [, Proceedings Am . Philoso- phical Society , Vol. 85] p. 297, line 25) which I propose to trans- late as follows : " The aromatic plant (called) i May I persist !

" It cannot be decided whether the aromatic plant which Ishtar as well as Marduk used in order to counteract the mephitic stench of the Netherworld is to be identified with the fabulous " Plant of Life " or belongs to the category of "life-carrying" plants which are considered 44 numinous " on account of their characteristic forms, colors or smells.

In the manner of the single chariot-driver, he fastens their reins to his girdle (line 51) (*) to be able to use both hands in the struggle. 14 - En. El. IV : 73 - 86 . With irritating inconsistency, the text of our poem has, so far, mentioned quite a number of attacks directed or planned by the deities of the abyss against their brothers in the heavenly mansions. Apsu intended to drug them with a soporific, or to attack them with his strange šaššaru weapon ; Kingu ordered an attack with the enig- matic instructions contained in the two last lines of the first tablet, while some verses of the second and the forth tablet (II: 81, IV: 66) mention a specific stratagem of the fiendish couple Kingu and Tiamat which had already proven its efficiency against Ea and Anu (cf above no. 9). It failed, however, against Marduk. " He (Marduk) only looks and already his (Kingu 's) advance becomes confused, his mind perplexed, his actions uncoordinated " (lines 67-68). Only Tiamat u did not turn her neck", and this reveals that none of her allies - although endowed by her with a divine melammû (cf. I : 134-135) could bear the sight of the flaming glory of Marduk with his double godhead (cf. I : 91) or tenfold melammû (1 : 1 03) (and of the above mentioned additional optical phenomena) with which the foresight of his father Ea had provided him. Strange as it may seem to us, neither Ea himself nor Anu was able to face the terror-inspiring glare or Medusa-like stare of the demonic Tiamat who alone proved an equal to Marduk. Without diverting her eyes, she pronounced her conjuration - but without ef- fect on her adversary. Now follows a short exchange of belligerent speeches before the battle is joined. The astute wording of both speeches is worth noticing. In their patent efforts to win over the onlooking followers (*) For very early representations of chariots drawn by four animals, I refer to predynastic clay-figurines from Kish, etc. (2) Text: na-as-ma-di i-du-us-sa i-lul ; to nasmadu and e lé lu cf. my Material Culture index s. v.</page><page sequence="22">228 A.

" 75 The Lord [brandished] the abûbn- mace, his mighty weapon, 76 and addresséd the (following) words to the enraged Tiamat: 77 44 [You alone revļolted, ambitious as you are, 78 4 4 you (alone) conceived the idea of calling to arms ! 79 4 4 [Now they ri]ot and act wrongly against their family 80 " while you, their [own mother], have discarded [all mo]therly [feelings ! 81 " And then you have promoted Kingu to be your mate 82 " thus replacing the authority of Anu with your illegal authority. 83 " You also had evil intentions against Anšar, the king of the [gods, 84 " and you have actually proven your wickedness against my [divine fathers (/. e.

I V : 1 0 3 - 1 14. Tiamat seems to have been invulnerable in the sense that her skin could not be penetrated by any weapon. This may safely be inferred from the fact that Marduk's plan of attack was basically devised to make her open her mouth, obviously because it was her only vulnerable spot. After having encircled the monster with his net Marduk sends forth the imķullu-demon whom he had previously hidden in the rear-guard (line 96). Promptly Tiamat swallowed the imķullu who presently blew up her body and forced her to gape her mouth in pain. This was the moment for which Marduk was waiting. He shot an arrow through the open mouth into her interior, thus killing the otherwise invulnerable Tiamat : 103 (Thus) he brought her down and ended her life ; 104 he threw the corpse (to the ground) in order to mount on it. 105 After he had killed Tiamat, the(ir) leader,</page><page sequence="23">Mesopotamian Mythology I 229 106 he routed her army, scattered was her troupe 107 and the (rebel) gods, her helpers and companions, 108 took to their heels, trembling with terror, 109 trying to get out (of the trap) to save their lives. 110 But they could not flee, tightly surrounded as they were 111 and he made them prisoners, smashed their weapons. 112 Held in the net (of Marduk), they are lying in heaps, 113 stored away in caverns they lament constantly: 114 to be held (there) in (eternal) captivity is the punishment (which) [he (inflicted and which) they (have to) endure ! " These last verses reflect, of course, such mythological motifs as the fallen gods ", the imprisoned titans whose moaning can be heard from deep chasms, etc . We will, however, see later that the col- lective sanction against the rebel gods was eventually converted into capital punishment for the only culprit, while the others were par- doned. Again, our poet did not succeed in fusing together divergent theological traditions. The monstrous beings created by Tiamat are disposed of in a way which a break in the tablet prevents us from learning : 117 He (Marduk) fettered them with a nose-rope, [cut off?] their [hands 118 and trampled upon them and on their tuqumtu ( 1 ). Kingu's fate is death (line 120 44 he (Marduk) reckoned him (Kingu) among the dingiruggu (2) /. e . 1 dead gods ' "), and Marduk seized the powerful 4&lt; Charm of Supreme Power " placing it around his neck and impressing his own seal upon the (clay)-tag over the knot of the string on which the charm was hanging (line 122) (8). (l) For tuqumtu cf. on one hand the epitheton of Ishtar : tuquntu halpat ' 4 clad in tuquntu 99 (King, Seven Tablets 1 p. 222 : 12), and, on the other,, the phrase tuqutta nadù in KAR 76 : 9 (ZDMG LXXIV p. 180).

The text of these lines is definitely in disorder. Verses 126 and 127 mar the sequence (especially 126 " (thus) Marduk, the hero, achieved what Nudimmud strove after (in vain) ") and are probably added by a harmonizing editor (4). 123 After having overpowered his enemies and stood (on Tiamat) [as victor, 124 in order to crush underfoot (?) the head of the arrogant foe, 125 he erected a (monument commemorating the) triumph of Anšar [over all his enemies. 128 (Then) he returned to Tiamat whom he had overthrown, 1 29 (and again) the Lord ascended the flanks of (prostrated) Tiamat, 130 severed her head with his merciless miftu- pike. 131 (When) he split open the arteries (containing) her blood 132 the north wind carried it to remote places. 133 When his fathers saw (this) they rejoiced and jubilated 134 and brought him gifts, the due of the overlord and of the [victorious king ! (*) The scattering of the blood of Tiamat seems to have constituted an essential feature of the task imposed upon Marduk because it is also mentioned in lines 31-32 (when Marduk is given his orders). In view of the well-known concepts of Near-Eastern and Greek mythology that the blood of the gods is golden, and in view of the Biblical concept (8) that the far North was the home of the gods as well as of the gold, it is tempting to assume that our poem alludes here to similar ideas. According to such an etiological myth the Mesopotamians could well have explained the fact that gold is found in the mountains of the North, and hidden away in mines, etc . by linking this to the slaying of the primaeval monster Tiamat whose golden blood the northwind had scattered to these localities.

El. V : I 4 - 2 2 . In a diction which is graced with a rare blend of exact tech- nical language and poetic solemnity, the creative activities of Marduk are reported in the initial verses of the fifth tablet. He constructed celestial stations for all the great gods, creating stars as their representatives. He established the length of the year, determined its subdivisions, and fixed the point called Nîbiru " to establish their exact relations " (line 6), setting up the " stations " of Enlil and Ea " that none (of the planets) might make a mistake or go astray " (line 7). Doors were set up in the East and in the West for the daily course of the sun, the creation of which, however, is not men- tioned in the preserved part of this tablet (*).

" (4) The balance of this important tablet is missing and the few re- maining lines only make us feel this loss more acutely. The main event reported towards the end of the fifth tablet seems to have been a speech of the gods addressed to Marduk. This much can be inferred from the first line of the next tablet. The tenor of this speech is 'revealed by the reaction of Marduk. Ap- parently the gods complained that now - after the world of the dei superi had been saved by the victory of Marduk - they found themselves without servants and compelled to perform all the work necessary for their subsistence. Obviously, they suggested in their lost speech, to use th« captured rebels as slaves as was quite customary with prisoners of war in Mesopotamia. This desire to enjoy the fruits of victory seems to explain better the underlying situation than the assumption that the gods attempted to reintro- duce the status quo ante bellum , because this would characterize the revolt of Tiamat and her followers as caused by " social " reasons. I cannot help feeling that this entire intermezzo constitutes a dry priestly invention with the purpose of serving as a transition, linking the triumph of Marduk and the ensuing organization of the cosmos, to the story of the creation of man. With regard to the latter event, the author was faced with the exceedingly difficult problem of harmonizing his desire to represent Marduk as the only creative deity, with the generally recognized role of Ea as creator of mankind.

For reasons which we cannot guess, the solution proposed by the complaining gods was inacceptable to Marduk, and he offered the following compromise : 1 While listening to the speech of the gods 2 Marduk conceived the idea of creating a clever device (to help- [them) 3 his idea (*) he imparted to Ea 4 that he (Ea) might advise him with regard to what he (Marduk) [had thought out. 5 (Marduk) : " I shall collect the(ir) blood (that of the captive gods) [and create bones 6 14 (and thus) I shall bring into existence (*) a 4 robot ' (3) whose [name shall be * man ' ! 7 " I shall create this hdlu-amêlu (4) 8 " and he shall be charged with the services of the gods, thus [they will be relieved ! " 11 (5) Ea answered him by making him a(nother) proposition 12 and in order to make him change his mind with regard to the [(project of) relieving the gods : 13 Only one of them should be given (to be executed), 14 u this one (alone) should be cut up (6) so that mankind may be [formed (out of his blood). 15 44 (But first) the (assembly of the) Great Gods should convene 16 " that the guilty may be surrendered while the others stay [(alive) !

They are but machines devised to provide their lords with the necessities for their subsistence. It must noted liow cleverly the poet distributes the roles in the dialogue just trans- lated; Ea in his conservative, law-abiding and cautious attitude, in contradistinction to the more radical, hasty if ingenious Marduk. The purpose is quite obvious: to show that the original idea was Marduk's while the function of Ea is that of improving and putting into actual execution as can be seen from line 35 which clearly stresses that Ea (text: dÉ-a-ma) created mankind. Lines 37-38, however, show again the author's desire to make both gods share in the credit for this wonderful work: 37 This work (the creation of man) is impossible to understand, 38 Nudimmud (£. e. Ea) [performed it] according to the clever idea [of Marduk! In a speech which shows the diplomatic abilities of Marduk, he addresses the rebels (4) in ingratiating terms (#): 21 14 J f there was any truth in your first confession 22 " speak under oath (again) the truth to me (with regard to this [question) : 23 4 4 Who was it who stirred up the revolt 24 " and incited Tiamat to rebel, assembled the troupe? 25 44 If (8) he who stirred up the revolt is handed over 26 I shall make him suffer the punishment for his crime - (then) [you shall be released ! " They comply and must themselves cut the arteries of their former leader Kingu (4), an astute stratagem of Marduk who thus (4) They are called here Anunnaki, but when they comply with Mar- duk' s request they are termed dI-gi-gi ilâni rabUti (line 28). From this and other indications it is obvious that the author of the sixth tablet is rather care- less with regard to the designations used for the gods of the Marduk- clan, the imprisoned rebel gods, etc. He often uses indiscriminately, some- times inconsistently, such terms as 44 Great Gods 14 Igigi " and 44 Anunnaki (2) The text stresses that Marduk treated these gods ta-bi-is .

The newly created man is now charged with the service of the gods (i-mi-id du-ul-li line 34, repeated in line 36) while these are exempted ( ilê-ma um- taš-šir). The theme of the reorganization (4) of the universe, already touched upon in line 10 (cf. p. 233 note 5), is now taken up again and treated in detail. The divine spheres of influence are being established with 300 gods taking up guard-duty in the upper realm while as many are assigned to the lower ( irsitu ). After having thus received their commissions (term, techn.: têrtu mu"uru) and been assigned their duties (term, techn.: têrtu muddû ), the gods offer to erect for Marduk a sanctuary roomy enough to harbor them all when they come to visit their overlord and to do him homage (lines 49-54). Again Marduk improves upon this plan (he proposes a parakku ibru instead of the planned parakku nîmedu) but we cannot appreciate his wisdom due to the fact that the technical terms used in these verses (lines 47-58) remain obscure. 20 - En. El. VI : 1 08- 12 1. The organization of the " executive branch " of ihe world-govern- ment is the main topic of the middle part of the sixth tablet. A new banquet-scene introduces the important statement that: 78 the functions (of all the gods) were established, (their) compe- tencies defined, 79 the positions in Heaven and in the Netherworld were set up by [(an assembly of) all the gods; 80 (then) fifty of the gods took over their offices, 81 (while a committee of) seven gods wielded the power [over man- kind proper] (8). Another important statement is contained in verses 108-121, but a break in the tablet has prevented, so far, the correct understanding of this passage. In a very sophisticated and scholarly interpretation of Marduk's position as 4 1 the god of the gods", the poet calls the ( 1 ) Santi II and nakâlu II (hendiadys) (in the verses 9 and 43) require the translation given in the text ("to repeat, to make clever"). (2) Omit line 83 as a clumsy addition in a report which deals exclu- sively with the bow as sacred symbol of Marduk (lines 82-92).</page><page sequence="30">236 A. Leo Oppenheim gods worshippers of Marduk who thus set a pious example to mankind for its attitude towards the gods. The gods call themselves salmat qaqqadi (" black-headed "), a term which usually denotes mankind as a whole, but when they ask humanity to follow their example, they use the term salmat qaqqadi wasba[ ]. 108 (the gods speaking): "He (Marduk) shall be the shepherd of the [black headed (- the gods) [ ]. 109 (and) they shall recite [his name, or: remember his deeds] with- out forgetting for all days to come! 110 He (Marduk) shall allot (as their share) many offerings to his [fathers (= the gods) 111 (so) that they (shall be able to) provide for their upkeep and [(to) louk after their sanctuaries; 112 he (Marduk) shall (furthermore) provide (them) with incense to [smell (and) promote their magic power (4). 113 In (exact) correspondence with (this situation in) heaven they [(/. e . men) shall act/behave on earth, 114 he (Marduk) shall instruct the blackheaded, those who li[ve on [earth ?] 115 to remind them, as subjects, of their gods, 116 his command shall also provide shares for the goddesses. 118 (2) Without (ever) forgetting they (*. e . men) shall worship their [gods, 119 make their land beautiful, erect (new) sanctuaries for them! 120 May the blackheaded ( i . e . mankind) stand (worshipping) before [us, the(ir) gods 121 but he (Marduk) shall be the god of every one of us! " 21 - En. El. VII: 145-148. The hymnal epilogue, with its enumeration of the 50 sacred names of Marduk, is followed by (at least) two groups of verses 145-148 and 149-156 (157 ff. too damaged) which contain pious (4) We should, perhaps, bring the two verbs of this line in a causal relation ("to provide with incense to smell in order to increase (sušqú) their tû") and take this passage as revealing the cultic function of the burning of incense in Mesopotamia. (2) I omitted verse 117 ("they [Le. men] shall [thus] bring offerings to their gods as well as to their goddesses ") because it repeats unneces- sarily the content of the couplet 115-116.</page><page sequence="31">Mesopotamian Mythology 1 237 remarks of the scribe or author, as is customary in this type of cuneiform literature. The first group is of special interest: 145 That (thete verses) be (always) remembered (lit.: kept) the old [traditioner shall explain (them). 146 the wise one and the scholar shall discuss (them) among them- [selves ; 147 the father shall teach (their content) to his son and instruct [him, 148 (even) shepherds and herdsmen shall be given knowledge (of them)! These verses reflect, indeed, an amazingly elaborate program of religious life with regard to both theological studies and religious education. The most characteristic feature of this program is the division made in the religious community between theologians and laymen. Two types of the first are mentioned, maķru, the "old men" who carry the oral tradition with the correct (orthodox) interpre- tation (term, techn . .* kullumu) (*), and the enqu mûdû , the experts and scholars whose task it apparently was to discuss ( malâku ) the text, to study it, etc. Their professional learning separates the theo- logians from the laymen. While the first are differentiated according to their work, the latter fall into two groups on account of their social standing. We have the 44 shepherds and herdsmen " who live in the country-side on a low social and economic level, yet - so our scribe postulates - they should be given some kind of religious knowledge. The city-dwellers, however, are supposed to have had some religious education and they are obliged, by our scribe, to hand it down to their children. 4 4 The father shall instruct his son " says the text using the verb šunnu 44 to make repeat *' Clearly, these lines reflect a priestly concept of religious life which - ephemeral and locally restricted as it might be in Meso- potamia - still challenges a comparison with well-known and still valid requirements and values of the religions of the aķl-el-kitab- type (44 adherents of (a religion with) a (sacred) book '*). This re- semblence is furthermore accentuated when we keep in mind. that the poem was to be recited by a priest on the fourth day of the New Year's festival (2) 44 from its beginning to its end ". (l) For kullumu cf. a forthcoming lexicographical note. (2) This recitation took place in front of the Bel -image while the symbols of the gods Anu and EUil remained covered.</page><page sequence="32">238 A. Leo Oppenheim Further evidence for the concept of a " sacred book" alive in certain circles of priests, will be discussed in the third section. In a final remark, I wish to draw the attention of the reader of the Epic of Creation to its conspicuous lack of literary and stylistic (not philological) homogenety. The literary level of the text shifts with startling suddenness. From the majestic pace of the proem, for instance, it drops to lame verses, obviously meant to provide a stopgap or to bridge a cleavage in the composition. From verses of a dusty scholastic pedantry, it quickly shifts to passages of inspired beauty. Side by side, often in adjacent verses, we find concise, clear-cut diction, and an uneasy allusi veness hurrying over obscure or rejected incidents. A presentation which tells its tale with com- pressed and confusing words, is immediately followed by a passage of comfortable, even rcircumstantious, wordiness full of tiring repe- titions which loves to play with words and to cram the poem with learned theological niceties. There are, furthermore, as I have attempted to show in various cases, quite a number of added, interpolated, spurious and misplaced verses, and, above all, unmistakable traces of a not too consistent censorship with respect to religious ideas, moral concepts, etc. which endeavors to eliminate or, at least, to re-interpret stories and facts which the priestly poet had outgrown.</page></plain_text>
