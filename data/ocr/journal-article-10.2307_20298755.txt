The time has come, he says, for educators to take the lead in uniting the linear-logical and cyclical-metaphoric. &lt;** lexander Marshack has been in volved in creating a revolution in archaeology that promises to become a revolution in education as well. But let's postpone education for a bit and dig into Marshack's archaeology. In a new born classic work titled The Roots of Civilization, this one-time journalist quietly overturned the strata under which other scholars have buried them selves.1 He has done this by discovering lunar charts scratched on a bit of bone by Neanderthal-age humans nearly 8,500 years ago. These traces of activity are far earlier than anyone had previous ly presumed complex mental activity to have taken place in humans. In fact, the discovery has destroyed the "Neander thal" connotation so disrespectfully as signed to certain contemporary humans. Marshack has pushed the origins of cognitive competence to nearly 3,000 years before Sumerians invented cunei form writing. Beyond this discovery, Marshack contributes two new concepts: linear or sequential time and storied, cyclical, or wholistic time. Basically, he means that time, thought, and perception can be viewed in two ways. Linear-sequential ordering of time is cultural. Cyclical and wholistic views are more vividly linked to the natural world. The bone with the lunar markings is the earliest record of human notation in linear time. The ramifications of Marshack's discoveries force us to realize that humans were creating logical and linear concepts long before language and writing appeared on the scene. Thus we must revise our view of early humans. However, language and writing are now here. With them are the attendant linearities. With surprisingly few excep tions, languages are linear. Within the linguistics and grammar of a language lie the residual structures that require logical and linear progressions for the transmission of meaning. Moreover, in the fiber of Western society is woven a predisposition toward logic ? linear logic. Rationality is the style of linear thinking, and the languages we use in reading, writing, and arithmetic are con stantly and unendingly in use to remind us of its presence. In addition, modern humans have all but given up on Mar shack's cyclical time and have replaced it with the more rational linear time ? just as did those humans nearly 8,500 years ago. So much does rational-linear thinking dominate modern thought that it ap pears to have affected our minds! Psychologists Robert Ornstein and David Galin have become spokespersons for the theory that posits a neuro physiological basis for one of the oldest ideas in education: that we have essen tially two "minds" in our heads.2 More than that, they are located in different places. The brain has a long fissure that divides the two cerebral hemispheres. This fissure does not completely sepa rate the hemispheres, for a thick bundle of nerve fibers called the corpus callo sum serves as a communication conduit between the hemispheres. On one side of the corpus callosum lies the rational-linear mind. This is the mind that processes perception and sensory input in logical-linear modes. It requires structure and order; it is the residence of reading, writing, and arith metic. Beyond the corpus callosum in the right cerebral hemisphere lies the metaphoric mind. Its mode is analogic, intuitive, and wholistic. It also possesses the visual acumen of the brain. This side of the brain thrives on multiple relation ships processed simultaneously. In a simplistic way, we could say that the right cerebral hemisphere remembers faces while the left remembers names. Now how about the claim that rational-linear or left-mind thought has "affected our minds"? The answer is distressingly simple. The cultural ecology, with its emphasis on structure, logic, and linear conformity, overtly and tacitly prejudices against the analogic, intuitive, wholistic functions of the right mind. In fact, not only does the culture do so, but so too do psycholo gists with derivative perceptions of how the human mind works. For example, the most influential psychologist in American education to day is Jean Piaget.3 Piaget has created a developmental hierarchy to explain how the intellect develops; it is profoundly influential in the graduate schools and teacher preparatory institutions of America. Moreover, Piaget's stages of intellectual development form the psychological bases of many of the evaluation programs currently being used to establish educational account ability. Quite simply, Piaget's maturation scale has four stages that are roughly linked to age levels. In the first stage (birth to about 18 months), the child is easily distracted and his/her mind func BOB SAMPLES is author of three recent books and is writing five others on psychology, early childhood, learn ing, love, and personality.

This is called the sensorimotor stage. In it one is apparently inept at performing tasks of linear logic. At about age 2 the child enters a period when he or she begins to func tion well in linear tasks. This is termed the pre-operational stage. Children begin to use abstractions, clumsily but ob viously. Words, labels, names are all substituted for realities. Children at this level begin to lise strings of words in sentences. At age 5 or thereabouts children move to another level, concrete opera tions. By now they are well on their way to becoming abstract linear-logical thinkers. They can substitute thought for experience and have formulated laws of logic. If the logic is violated by experience, they presume the ex^erir erice to be at fault, not the logic. At about age 12 most children enter the apex of logical conformity, the formal operations stage. By this time the really good student will seldom make mistakes in reading, writing, an4 arithmetic. He/she will have given up intuitive, analogic explanations for those that are factual and explicit. In other words, the student will have be come left-hemisphere dominant - and will have abandoned cyclical thought for linear processes. hat Marshack describes in his analysis of the human species is in effect duplicated by each of us as we grow up in the rationally oriented Western cul ture ? a sort of recapitulation of the hominoid experience. But here is the catch: Piaget's descriptors are only valid in cultures that have placed major em phasis on linear thought. They apply only in cultures in which the cultural ecology is characterized by linearities in language, in structure, and in philoso phy. Steven Rose, a British neurophysiolo gist, has eloquently summed up the limitations of Piaget's work : Piaget's developmental stages have not been received uncritical ly* [Critics] point out that [the stages] have been derived from a very limited study of a few chil dren in a particular environ ment. ... How cross-cultural? Are they simply an analysis of the life-style of the Swiss child at a particular point in history? Any one who is familiar with the critique of Freudian psychoanaly sis will recognize that the same m limitations may apply to the sort of work Piaget has been doing.4 Moreover, there is evidence that the presence of abstract logic is necessary for people to gain access to Piaget's formal operations stage. This means that we not only need language, but it must be a symbolic written language. Rose says further: ... [T] he development of struc ture in the brain, both pre- and postnatally, runs parallel with the developmental function. But by definition function involves inter action with the environment, and at this point in the argument plasticity becomes superimposed upon specificity.... One important present implica tion [that] must be emphasized, however, is the impossibility of considering any aspect of brain function in isolation from its en vironment. Clearly it is always necessary to consider the brain as part of a system which includes all aspects of the environment of that brain.5 Taking Rose's argument, which of course is shared by many (notably Jerome Bruner, whose recent work ex amines the role of play in the develop mental process), we find that the en vironment, while not being everything, is a very important something. Linguists have never shied away from the role language plays in thpught patterns. Their arguments have shown that logic is wedded to the degree of abstraction in a language. Symbolic languages are by definition abstract; that is, symbols are substituted for sounds and/or meanings. The result is that to become expert in the logical manipulation that is neces sary to engage in Piaget's formal opera tions stage, one must become expert in language use. But there are few, if any, experimental data that have been ap plied to nonsyrhbolic-language humans. This means that what we assess depends upon the medium of assessment. If I choose to evaluate you on nonlogical qualities, I may well come up with an indicator of developmental maturity that has nothing to do with your lan guage or your conformity to external logical schemes. With this in mind (or is it minds?), it seems ironic that the rational validity of Piaget's descriptors is based on a circular and nonrational argument. The culture is used to describe the individual, and the description is used to relate the individual back to the culture. What's more, these culturally dependent argu ments are used to evaluate humans in our culture, which like the Swiss culture is Western and technocratic, and further we are compelled to evaluate other cultures in comparison with ours. But what is an alternative? if only half the mind is favored and ? as ration al test scores nationally seem to indi cate?we are losing ground where we presume to know the most, where can we go? My answer is simple: across the corpus cailosum. In work I have done for a decade and a half I have come to the conclusion that, though the rational mind has been favored, the metaphoric mind is well and waiting.6 In just the way that the idle left hemisphere waited until a period beginning nearly 10,000 years ago to make its presence known, our right hemisphere is r?ady to deal with th? rational overload of con temporary times. his conclusion is hardly unique to me. Hundreds of the teris of thousands of teachers I have worked with across the nation reached it and acted quietly on it years ago. Thus my purpose now is to gather together an awareness base and to weave this into a theoretical framework. During the past sever! years my search has ranged throughout all kinds of cultural and educational set tings, from East Harlem to Navajo schools in New Mexico, from minority less suburbs in Colorado to U.S. Depart ment of Defense Dependent Schools in Asia and Europe. In all of these places my colleagues and I have searched for ways to enhance the dialogue between the hemispheres, the cerebral hemis pheres. With heavy funding from the National Science Foundation, we pur sued strategies that would not only enhance the left-hemisphere functions so aptly described by Piaget but would invite into concert those magical quali ties of the right hemisphere as well. Albert Einstein once spoke of intuition as a sacred gift and likened rationality to a faithful servant. Our basic purpose was to shift the tendency to worship the servant and ignore the sacred. The materials we developed under this federal funding evolved into trans disciplinary, all-grade-level materials. After several years of testing and evalu ating, we came to the realization that when one invites both mind functions into equal partnership, three things characterize the learning ecology: 1) higher feelings of self-confidence, self-esteem, and compassion; 2) wider tf MAY 1977 68?</page><page sequence="3">exploration of traditional content sub jects and skills; 3) higher levels of creative invention in content and skills. Because we were not going into, areas that were well known in the literature or in educational experience, we could not use evaluation strategies that were bound into the standard decimal-placed mentality research models. We operated more in the natural history mode of Charles Darwin than the controlled ex periment mode of B. F. Skinner, more as therapists than as empirical scientists. We described rather than predicted. We gleaned structures from the experiences rather than imposed structures upon the experience ? always alert to how our own cultural biases intruded upon the experiences we shared with others. Out of it all came a series of strate gies related to metaphoric or right hemisphere functions tnat are as explicit as are the functions for the stages of Piaget. Though as explicit, they are by no means the same. The Piagetian stages of intellectual development are derived by conformity to explicit convergent functions. The metaphoric modes I pro pose are related to syntheses of explicit nonvergent functions. Progress in ration al (left-hemisphere) functions leads to the reduction of variables and higher tendencies to separate thought qualities. Progress in metaphoric (right-hemis phere) functions leads to the pro liferation of variables and higher tend encies to synthesize thought qualities. The rational processes are linear, the metaphoric processes cyclical. Rational processes are exclusive while metaphoric processes are inclusive. Now to the metaphoric modes. The four modes of metaphoric thinking are separated as they are on process grounds. I have done this because my interest is in how they can be applied in instructional and life settings. Thus these modes are created out of respect for the verb being rather than the noun philosophy. In children before age 5 these metaphoric modes are absolutely nonhierarchical. However, when the concrete operations stage of Piaget is reached, then a tacit hierarchy of the metaphoric modes is established. I be lieve this hierarchy is cultural, not natural. This tacit hierarchy applies to all adults with whom we have worked. The Symbolic Metaphoric Mode.* The symbolic metaphoric mode exists when a symbol is substituted for an object, process, or condition. The symbol can take two forms: abstract, letters, numbers, written words, etc.; or visual, as in a visual picture of the object, process, or condition being represented. This mode is the easiest metaphoric strategy with which to ap proach adults. It is still part of the contemporary culture, surrounding us in all advertising and even on road signs. The abstract symbolic mode is il lustrated by the word STOP on a red hexagonal sign whose shape is a visual metaphoric mode image. The European road sign tradition is an even better example. Wprds ? abstract symbolic representations ? are being replaced by visual symbolic representations in the form of outlines of the picture message. In language teaching as well as other linear subjects, teachers often do not distinguish between these qualities as they teach. Children with difficulties in linear processing are diagnosed as having learning disabilities; they might even be called dyslectic. In Japan, where two alphabets* are in use, a vivid example of the differences between these concepts arises. One Japanese alphabet, the Katakana, is phonetic. That is, its visual image is a symbol (abstract) of a sound. The other alphabet is called Kanji. In Kanji the symbol (visual) is a picture of a concept. Japanese children, if dyslec tic, are usually dyslectic in the Katakana alphabet and almost never in Kanji. This same condition was discerned in Japanese patients who had suffered left hemisphere strokes. They became aphasie in Katakana but not in Kanji. Although both alphabets possess visual components and thus are processed by the right cerebral hemis phere, the transference of symbolic abstract images seems to require another step. If this transfer is not easy for students, we shift to symbolic-visual images. College and high school students as well as elementary-age students we have worked with all became far more eloquent and language competent if we allowed them symbolic-visual expression when they faltered with symbolic abstract. In simplest terms, if they couldn't write an idea we asked them to paint it, draw it, or sculpt it. Then later we asked them to tell or write the idea. Care must be taken here that the stu dent doesn't begin to think art or visual expression exists solely for rational linear purposes. Too much of this and the metaphoric mind feels like the victim of rape. The Synergic Comparative Mode. The synergic comparative mode exists when two or more objects, processes, or conditions are compared in such a way that both are synthesized into a greater whole as a result of the comparison. Unlike rational comparisons in which the mental processes act to separate and specify, the synergic comparative mode synthesizes and extends. A classic ex ample would be Alfred Noyes's lines from "The Highwayman": *I use alphabet as a metaphor in this context. natural capacity school experience SYMBOLIC 3? ?a ?2?S o H 5 h &amp; &gt; SYMBOLIC FORMAI OPERATIONAL CONCRETE OPERATIONAL PRE OPERATIONAL SENSORY MOTOR W8&amp;WMHnBMMHMMHHHnflHHBH^ FIGURE ONE Natural capacity to perform in the metaphoric mode is shown on the left. The solid color throughout indicates that all modes are capable of being used at all levels of intellectual maturity. The school (i.e., cultural) experience is shown on the right. Only the symbolic-abstract mode is consistently rewarded. All other modes are generally excluded via text materials, curriculum emphasis, and pressure on teachers and administrators in the area of the three Rs. *Much of what follows is adapted from my book, The Metaphoric Mind (Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley, 1976). 690 PHI DELTA KAPP AN</page><page sequence="4">The road was a ribbon of moon light over the purple moor. In an analytic mode these qualities, roadness and ribbonness, would be chal lenged as being different and separate. In the syrtergic comparative mode they are not only the saine but are more than each by being compared. In this mode there are the roots of cyclical thought that in effect link all things in the universe together. It is represented by much of Native Ameri can philosophy, which is deeply cyclical and wholistic. It is a vital component of creativity, in that the creative mind sees unity in diversity. As a result it feels well-fed when there are multiple inputs. The metaphoric mind presumes con nectedness and searches it out. The rational mind presumes separateness and creates it. The Integrative Metaphoric Mode. The integrative metaphoric mode occurs when the physical and psychic qualities of the person involved are extended into direct experience with objects, pro cesses, or conditions outside themselves. This is literally a getting into it mode. Recent research has dispelled the notion that humans possess five senses. Even the tokenism that acknowledges the "sixth sense" is absurd in the face of the abundance of data from this country and abroad indicating that awareness sensors in us may number well above 20. Thus this mode is a reintroduction of the total self in the process of experiencing during learning. It is re markable that this mode dominates in children at exactly the 'time that rational culture observers cite the most profound development in learning. Chil dren in Piaget's pre-operational stage acquire speech and language simul taneously with learning to cope with walking upright. The remarkable part is how this mode is abandoned once adolescence and adulthood are reached. I have had social scientists with Ph.D.s use this mode for nonverbal exploration of highly technical concepts in their fields. When they had com pleted the integrative mode exploration, I asked children present to explain their understanding of the concepts. The so cial scientists were amazed at the depth to which the children understood ? and not a word had been spoken. This mode can be applied in schools through movement activities, charades, mime, and improvisation, but the real payoff comes when participants begin to enter a level of experience and understanding that transcends all of these acts.7 It is a mode of knowing that can only be deemed cyclical. There is total immersion, reaching totally un precedented levels of understanding in the individual's experience. Whereas the rational modes discredit and ridicule anthropomorphism, the integrative mode celebrates it. The Inventive Metaphoric Mode. The inventive metaphoric mode is entered any time a person creates a new level of awareness or knowing as the result of self-initiated exploration of objects, processes, or conditions. The word that matters here is creates as opposed to discovers. Too often rational modes of knowing emphasize discover and deni grate create. This kind of rational em phasis tends to demean individual crea tions by rushing to compare them with collective history. For example, a child who suddenly understands the Archi medes Principle, having just thrust her fist in a glass of water and caused it to overflow, would ordinarily be told (if she were not reprimanded) that Archi medes had discovered that centuries ago. The result: What could have been an act to nurture, an attitude of inven tion, has become part of a putdown. Invention is personal in this mode, and it is the result of a buzzing swarm of variables being juggled simultaneously with no discrete selection taking place other than interestedly sensing that which emerges. Isaac Newton, speaking for the ra tional mind, was reported to have said, "The purpose of the scientist is to sail the oceans of the unknown to discover the islands of truth." Jerome Bruner, the noted psychologist, amended this to read, "The purpose of the scientist is to sail the oceans of the unknown and invent the islands of truth." To nurture this mode, invention in any medium can be encouraged and then, once done, accepted. Acceptance is the key word. A certain amount of invention must be done and accepted before the inventor is strong enough to allow these inven tions to be analyzed. A Nobel laureate once said, "Analysis is a helluva lot easier than invention, which is why so much more of it goes on!" My col leagues and I report elsewhere on this issue: Central to the formulation of the metaphoric modes was the issue of how they could fit into schools as they exist. A second issue was our concern about how the metaphoric modes relate to the rational developmental levels of Piaget. What we discovered was that students from age 4 and at any grade level have the capacity to perform effectively in each of these metaphoric modes. In addi tion, we were able to determine that through use of the meta phoric modes these students were also able to develop more comfort and ability in exploring concepts, ideas, and processes in rational ways. This led us to the next step. We examined existing curriculum materials, standardized tests, and the prevailing psychological vision (cognitive and behavioristic) and tried to determine at which levels of schooling the metaphoric modes were systematically ex cluded. The results are shown irt Figure 1. It was clear to us that the capacity to perform all the metaphoric modes is uniform throughout the rational stages of development. However, it was also clear that in terms of school ex perience there is a diminishing utilization of all the metaphoric modes, except symbolic abstract, as one goes up through the cogni tive stages. The point here is that the capacity for expressing meta phoric knowing persists at all stages of cognitive maturity, yet, in terms of prevailing teaching strategies and curriculum materi als, appropriateness of its use is diminished throughout the school experience.8 These modes of the metaphoric mind all operate at once, yet some are more appropriate in social contexts than others. They have never disappeared from our capability; it is just that they have been given second-class citizenship in the community of thought. Certainly the muse has lived throughout the his tory of humankind, but genius in meta phor is more often rewarded if it results in something useful. More people in our "Recent research has dispelled the notion that humans possess five senses. Even the tokenism that acknowledges the 'sixth sense' is absurd . . .

The metaphoric mind faces the pecking order created by rationality. Schools and tax agencies seem to have been created for each other. Counting and affirming, conforming and analyz ing dominate the educational and social scene. ut the ghost of cyclical thought is quietly emerging again. Widespread cul tural interest in Black Elk, Don Juan, the Senoi people, and a thousand other sources of nontechnological knowing is growing each day. Body awareness and more natural foods are being sought. These are trivial symptoms, some claim, because they are an individual phenome non and not a cultural one. However, it is precisely at this level of individual choice that the birthrate in this nation was brought to a realistic level, so that zero population growth might have a chance. Cynics say, "Folly. ZPG can never work because too many people are being kept alive at the other end. Old people are being 'preserved' by medical science." It's true that medical science has this capacity and has exer cised it, but the fastest growing in dividual movement in this country to day is the "right to die" advocacy. Jonas Salk believes there is a genetic kind of imprint within the biochemical strands of life stuff within us that will provide the wisdom to survive.9 He defines wisdom as the Use of both sides of the mind, the analytic and analogic. Strangely, it was the biologists who gave us the first great metaphor for the poet locked Within each scientist. Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny, they said. Not only did it rhyme, but its message was mind-shattering. It translated as mean ing the development of the fertilized egg from the moment of conception to the time of birth is in effect a metaphoric journey taken by all creatures that have ever lived. That is, the germ cells go from one-celled life to multi-celled forms through the images of sala manders, frogs, fish, and eventually to humans. Piaget in innocence gave us "developmentogeny recapitulates cul turogeny," though certainly not in those words. He showed us in his stages of mental development a mirror of the culture. However, neither the sensorimot?r stage nor cyclical thought ever has left us. Just as the developmental forms in the womb have counterparts in the ocean depths and jungles of today's a world, we are all here. Education and culture have been biased against the whole. They have nurtured a part. But in silence the metaphoric mind has preserved the forgotten parts. The ghost of the genius of all humans lies within each of us. The cyclic time, the natural rhythm of the universe is still within each of us. And there is little doubt that the time has come to unite what we have become with what we have post poned. We have always be?n here, await ing these seasons of synergy. 1. Alexander Marshack, The Roots of Civili zation (New York: McGfaw-Hill, 1972). 2. See Robert E.
