<plain_text><page sequence="1">Subjunctive Imagination in In Memoriam HARRY PUCKETT Abstract. In Memoriam is not primarily the affirmation of truths or the affirmation of a belief but rather the affirmation of will. Using the subjunc- tive, Tennyson sets up a series of imagined worlds, which are then frequently overthrown or qualified, so that the poem moves gradually through a series of flawed imaginings to a higher quality of imagination at the conclusion. Early in the poem the flawed images are usually those of imagined loss or despair, which the poet overthrows in order to recover the will to live and love. But more important are the shabby or extravagant hopes which appear rather early in the poem and continue well into the latter half. These, too, are overthrown as the poet moves toward more perfect images of hope, finally displacing one act of the will (hoping) with another (loving). This process of a gradually perfected imagination, leading to a perfected will, is far more important and more interesting than any set of truths or beliefs that might be gleaned from In Memoriam. The poem may thus be taken as a model by those who, after Keats in the nineteenth century, or Pound and Stevens in the twentieth, regard aesthetic experience, the perfected imagination, as a way of transcending the failure to know and the difficulties of belief. Memoriam is commonly taken to be a philosophical poem, which in certain respects it no doubt is, but too often the poem is treated as though it proceeds like philosophical prose. Tennyson does create an argu- mentative impression, partly induced by his frequent use of subjunctives; but it needs to be noticed that these constructions- typically "if . . . , then . . ." or some related pattern- are not arguments of the kind found in philosophical prose. Tennyson's use of the subjunctive is ordinarily a way of setting up images, a vivid world of possibilities, against which he launches an odd kind of affirmation. Typically the world he sets up in this way is a world of loss, decay, and despair; it is sometimes, however, a world of shabby or extrava- gant hope. In either case, by setting it up subjunctively, Tennyson is in a position to reject it or induce a rejection in the reader. The world that he 97</page><page sequence="2">98 / VICTORIAN POETRY himself wills, imaginatively and subjunctively, thus becomes a stepping-stone, upon which the poet rises to a more perfect vision and a more perfect will. In Memoriam thus constitutes a strong affirmation, but it is not primarily the affirmation of a truth; and there are pitfalls even in calling it an affirmation of faith. It is primarily an affirmation of will. And by means of the repeated construction and overthrow of imagined worlds, it involves the perfecting of that will through a perfected imagination. It is this will that Tennyson is primarily concerned to attain, assert, and perfect; and the Prologue early establishes this concern: "Our wills are ours, we know not how; / Our wills are ours, to make them thine." The first of the numbered sections then suggests the course whereby this unification of human will with divine will may be accomplished, and the poet's somewhat uncertain trust in that course: That men may rise on stepping-stones Of their dead selves to higher things. But who shall so forecast the years And find in loss a gain to match? This element of uncertainty is emphasized in the third stanza of section I, which plunges the reader into the central problem of the poem- the question whether a man can indeed go on loving in spite of grief, loss, and doubts. This stanza also introduces one of the central techniques of the poem- using the subjunctive as a means of presenting an image of loss, against which the poet asserts his will: Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drowned, Let darkness keep her raven gloss: Ah, sweeter to be drunk with loss, To dance with Death, to beat the ground, Than that the victor Hours should scorn The long result of love, and boast, 'Behold the man that loved and lost, But all he was is overworn.' We know from the Prologue that the poet sees his "wild and wandering cries" as flawed, if only because they represent a threat to love. Ironically, however, it is only through a union of love and grief in section I that either can survive; and Tennyson justifies this union, urging his right to grieve, even to the point of intoxicated extravagance, by positing that image of subjunctive loss, the man overworn. The effort expended by Tennyson to posit that image, to drag himself out of inert grief into a creative act, is a crucial part of his self- assertion. Ironically, however, it is precisely in rejecting the willed image of loss- that man overworn- that the poet asserts his need to grieve. Such a will may be flawed, even maudlin, but it is alive, and the progress of the poem toward a more perfect will can begin. The use of the subjunctive in advancing this progress occurs in well over fifty of the numbered sections of In Memoriam, but reference to only a few</page><page sequence="3">HARR Y PUCKETT / 99 of these will serve to show its uses.1 Having called himself delirious in section XVI, Tennyson goes on in section XVIII to posit subjunctively the physical resuscitation of Hallam's body: Ah yet, even yet, if this might be, I, falling on his faithful heart, Would breathing through his lips impart The life that almost dies in me. But then in a quick reversal he turns from this quasi-suicidal and quasi- necrophiliac wish to everyday life: "That dies not, but endures with pain, / And slowly forms the firmer mind." Such expert control over his imagination and his language in scenes of this kind is one of the features distinguishing the speaker of In Memoriam from the often extravagant and ghoulish hero of Maud. Although Tennyson frequently remarks on the wild and imperfect nature of his fears and longings in In Memoriam, these never become loathsome- partly because Tennyson puts some distance between himself and the scene (or his reader and the scene) when he presents it subjunctively. The rather complicated syntax usually involved in subjunctive statement tends to slow the pace, giving us not an urgent cry but a meditative rhythm; and the subjunctive itself places a kind of frame around the scene, making it an object of contemplation, not an occurrence. One needs only to transpose the scene in section XVI into the indicative, so that the action described actually occurs- the poet actually falls on Hallam's body, breathes through his dead lips, and so on-to get an effect totally foreign to In Memoriam but not in the least foreign to Maud. Both poems are concerned with the development of the "firmer mind," but In Memoriam proceeds more subtly, working with a more common situation. Precisely because the flawed imaginings of In Memoriam are relatively common, they are less likely to be seen as flawed by the common reader, who may therefore overlook the poet's sheer aesthetic growth, which powers the moral change from a self-destructive and love-destructive will to the creative and enduring will that Tennyson addresses in the final numbered section. Tennyson, however, is often enough explicit about the dubious fictions spun off from his imagination. In section XXIII he looks back on the past, and his whole imagination is caught up in nostalgia- a state of mind well- 1 Among the "over fifty" are the following: I, VI, IX, X, XI, XIII, XIV, XV, XVII, XXIV, XXVI, XXX, XXXIII, XXXVI, XXXVIII, XL, XLII, XLIII, XLIV, XLV, XLVIII, XLIX, L, LIII, LVI, LXI, LXII, LXIII, LXV, LXXI, LXXIII, LXXVI, LXXVII, LXXX, LXXXI, LXXXIII, LXXXIV, LXXXV, LXXXVI, XC, XCII, XCIV, CVI, CVII, CIX, CXIII, CXIV, CXVIII, CXX, CXXII, CXXIV, CXXV, CXXVII. The count is conserva- tive; other lyrics could be included.</page><page sequence="4">100/ VICTORIAN POETRY known for its tendency to produce distorted judgments, and a state of mind that recurs frequently in In Memoriam. Tennyson arrives at an absurd con- clusion about his days with Hallam: "And all we met was fair and good, / And all was good that Time could bring." In the following section (XXIV) Tennyson sees the absurdity and immediately withdraws from his conclusion, though he does so in the subjunctive, and later in the interroga- tive, thus not quite withdrawing everything: If all was good and fair we met, This earth had been the Paradise It never looked to human eyes Since our first Sun arose and set. He supposes it may be his grief that makes the past appear better than it was, or, as he suggests interrogatively in the final stanza, the past may have its place, as time seen at a distance, with all the imperfections and irrelevancies obscured, as the perfection of a star is achieved by its being far. Since the section ends on a question, it is ultimately inconclusive, except in one respect, which is the most important of all. Tennyson has rejected the raw and deceptive nostalgia of section XXIII, yet without rejecting the past itself. His imagination remains active, to will new images of the past that give it a valid presence in human affairs- a presence similar to that of an art work, in which some aspect of being is given a fictional existence, free from accidents and irrelevancies, but nonetheless a valid existence. The issue is a crucial one for the entire poem. If the poet lives in the past, particularly in an absurdly imagined past, his capacity for love in the present world is damaged. A union of his own will with the Love he invokes in the Prologue can occur only if he reorients his attention from past to present and future. But more than a simple reorientation is required. The poet cannot simply turn his back on the past or on Hallam; he must integrate them, "mingle" them, as Tennyson puts it in section CXXIX, with "all the world." It is not merely the redirection of his will from past to present, but the perfecting of his will and imagination that must be accomplished and is accomplished by the end of the poem. Thus, in section XXIV the subjunctive plays the role already observed in other sections: through it Tennyson carries the faintly corrupt image of the past presented in XXIII to a full-blown and obviously absurd extension of that image in XXIV, preparing the way for a rejection which is also an affirmation. II Sections XXXIV-XXXVI are particularly important to the development of In Memoriam because they illustrate the assertion-withdrawal-affirmation process with regard to the crucial issue of man's immortality- the issue upon which T. S. Eliot bases his attack when he celebrates In Memoriam for the "quality of its doubt" but assails it for the quality of its faith:</page><page sequence="5">HARRY PUCKETT 1 101 The renewal craved for seems at best but a continuance, or a substitute for the joys of friendship upon earth. His desire for immortality never is quite the desire for Eternal Life; his concern is for the loss of man rather than for the gain of God.2 Many sections of In Memoriam do express a desire for personal reunion of the type Eliot describes, and if one reads the poem, particularly the first half of it, as a consistent statement of Tennyson's "faith"- that is, his creed- then it does seem a poor thing, as Eliot calls it. But In Memoriam is, of course, not a consistent statement. By the end of the poem those vivid, extended images of personal reunion in a Miltonically grand and geographied heaven give way to a pervasive though elusive sense of human immortality in which the spirit of Hallam is mingled with all the world in every moment (CXXIX and CXXX). Thus, even to regard the poem in the usual way, as primarily a movement from despair to hope, is to overlook the fact that many images of hope occur in the first half of the poem which have been explicitly rejected or put out of mind by the end. Not merely the quantity of hope but the quality changes. Moreover, Tennyson's concern over what Eliot calls "the loss of man"- death in general and the loss of Hallam in particular- is always secondary to a concern over his own will to go on living and loving. These sections (XXXIV-XXXVI) are also interesting for having been misread in three characteristic ways by three of Tennyson's best readers: Bradley, Gransden, and Buckley. Their misreadings are important partly because they are precisely the sort that invites the attack mounted by Eliot on Tennyson's "faith" and indeed guarantees the success of the attack. Section XXXIV confronts the question of immortality vividly and imaginatively but also in a way fundamentally inconclusive: My own dim life should teach me this, That life shall live for evermore, Else earth is darkness at the core, And dust and ashes all that is; This round of green, this orb of flame, Fantastic beauty; such as lurks In some wild Poet, when he works Without a conscience or an aim. What then were God to such as I? Twere hardly worth my while to choose Of things all mortal, or to use A little patience ere I die; 'Twere best at once to sink to peace, Like birds the charming serpent draws, To drop head-foremost in the jaws Of vacant darkness and to cease. ^Selected Essays: New Edition (New York, 1950), p. 292.</page><page sequence="6">102 / VICTORIAN POETRY The poet accepts, in a subjunctive construction, the dreary view of man's fate from which he develops characteristic images of loss and decline culminating in subjunctive suicide. The section apparently begins with the affirmation of a truth, but in line three this affirmation becomes conditional, and the full energy of the second stanza goes to develop, not the opening affirmation, but the conditional imagery. The last two stanzas set forth images and attitudes reminiscent of "The Lotos-Eaters," with the final stanza emphasizing both the attractive and the repellent features of a total loss of will. Dominating the section, though softened by its subjunctivity, is the half-blasphemous cry at the center: "What then were God to such as I?" The force of this section resides not in the argument, which is at best inconclusive, but in the images to which the argument leads. Logically, one might conclude that the earth is indeed a wild fantasy, that suicide is indeed the appropriate response. But the images do not foster that response. Paradoxically, those images of loss and despair constitute an affirmation- a revulsion against the loss of will induced by that "charming serpent," a revulsion against the dizzy, headfirst drop into darkness- a negative affirma- tion. Part of the affirmation thus consists in the act of creation itself- in the will to imagine a frightening possibility, embodied in vivid images, that contain within themselves the implicit rejection of the images and the possibility. The loss here is not, like the loss of Hallam, a donnee; it is a tour de force. This section does not affirm a belief in immortality. The closing image might encourage such a belief, but the argument itself is inconclusive. The section ends by observing that if man is not immortal it would be better to commit suicide. In a characteristic way, Tennyson dodges or outflanks the question of truth with which the poem appears to open, turning it into a question of feeling, behavior, and will. The question becomes, not "What is true?" but "What would I feel and do?" The subjunctive turn that begins with "else" becomes not a way of developing a conclusion about immortality but a way of developing images of loss and decay. Upon the success of these images the poetry depends; the argument is essentially a way of getting the images before the reader. The argument, however, is not insignificant. It is most significant because it is tainted. Tennyson's trust in God and his will to love and live are made to rest explicitly on the supposition that "life shall live for evermore." If this expectation is not to be fulfilled, then his interest in God is nonexistent; and his power to love and his will to live are dissipated in an unwilled drop into death. Tennyson's sense of priority here must seem flawed to a committed Christian like Eliot, for whom Eternal Life depends on a trust in God and the will to love-not, as in section XXXIV, the other way round. If this section is to be taken as a statement of Tennyson's faith, then that faith must seem not only to Eliot but to many others a "poor thing" indeed. However, In</page><page sequence="7">HARR Y PUCKETT 1 1 03 Memoriam has established itself in earlier sections as a poem capable of including flawed visions which the poet subsequently rejects. A reader may therefore rightly suspect that the subjunctive, quasi-blasphemous dismissal of God in section XXXIV, together with the unchristian order of priorities, may be a state of mind which the poet will later want to slough, as a dead self, on his way to a better vision. Section XXXV does, in fact, struggle against the order of priorities in XXXIV, though again it works subjunctively, moving finally to an image of dissipation; and again it is in reaction against this image that the poet makes his affirmation: Yet if some voice that man could trust Should murmur from the narrow house, 'The cheeks drop in; the body bows; Man dies: nor is there hope in dust,' Might I not say? 'Yet even here, But for one hour, O Love, I strive To keep so sweet a thing alive:' But I should turn mine ears and hear The moanings of the homeless sea, The sound of streams that swift or slow Draw down Aeonian hills, and sow The dust of continents to be; And Love would answer with a sigh, 'The sound of that forgetful shore Will change my sweetness more and more, Half-dead to know that I shall die.' O me, what profits it to put An idle case? If Death were seen At first as Death, Love had not been, Or been in narrowest working shut, Mere fellowship of sluggish moods, Or in his coarsest Satyr-shape Had bruised the herb and crushed the grape, And basked and battened in the woods. The final move of this section is to induce a reaction against the image of subjunctive bestiality, and by contrast to affirm the ultimate value of love and the power to love. The section is concerned only in a marginal way with the question "What is true?" and centrally concerned with the questions "What would we do? What would we be?" The argument is a continuation of XXXIV and is equally inconclusive about the question of immortality. The inconclusiveness of both sections XXXIV and XXXV, and their marginal concern with truth, is emphasized by A. C. Bradley, who nonethe- less hopes to emerge with a truth by appealing to the next section, XXXVI: His 'own dim life' evidently does not show that life is immortal; it shows at most that unless life were believed to be immortal, that which is of most value in it would not have come into existence or continue to exist. Yet XXXVI., stanza I (which corresponds with XXXIV. 1, 2), seems to say that the fact of immortality is implied in human fife; for the truth made 'current coin' by Christ must surely be the truth that man is immortal.3 3A Commentary on Tennyson's "In Memoriam," 3rd ed. (London, 1910), pp., 114-115.</page><page sequence="8">1 04 / VICTORIAN POETR Y By appealing to section XXXVI Bradley hopes to get a clear statement of truth or belief from sections XXXIV and XXXV, thereby subduing one of their most imposing characteristics- a pronounced diffidence toward final conclusions, which shows up again in the way XXXV struggles against the implications of XXXIV, and shows up again in XXXVI, where Tennyson explicitly elevates "the loveliness of perfect deeds" over what he calls "poetic thought." The whole of section XXXVI is quite explicit about the gulf between divine truth and mortal minds which receive that truth not at all from close reasoning (either Tennyson's or Bradley's) but only in tales and deeds. If one is inclined to speculate on precisely which truths are the subject of XXXVI, he would do well to begin by noticing Christ's ample demonstra- tion of the power of love- for it is the importance of love that sections XXXIV and XXXV, and In Memoriam as a whole, assert repeatedly and emphatically. Granted, it would be important to notice also the connection in both Tennyson's poetry and Christ's life between love and the conquest over death. But then it becomes essential to point out that Christ emphasized love of God and man as the way to eternal life, which is a position crucially different from the argument of sections XXXIV and XXXV-that immortality, or at least a belief in immortality, is a necessary condition for the will to live and love. We should not be surprised if a discriminating Christian like Eliot should say as he does of Tennyson that "his desire for immortality is never quite the desire for Eternal Life; his concern is for the loss of man rather than the gain of God" {Selected Essays, p. 292). But Eliot's attack is no better grounded than Bradley's interpretation; indeed, the Bradleian mode of interpreting the poem invites the sort of attack that Eliot mounts. If sections XXXIV and XXXV are to be taken as a statement of Tennyson's belief, then, by comparison with the teachings of Christ, which regard eternal life as dependent upon the power to love (rather than vice versa), Tennyson's faith is indeed a "poor thing." The same might be said if Tennyson's "faith," as expressed in these sections, were compared with that of the Buddha or Lao-Tse (whose teaching influenced Tennyson's late poem "The -Ancient Sage").4 Since Tennyson does not refer explicitly to Christ but instead refers only to "the Word," and because Tennyson sees the essential faith as persisting through many forms (section CXXVII), one cannot assume that Christ is the only religious figure to be considered here. But the obvious allusion to the Gospel of John certainly brings Christ most immediately to mind, and a comparison of Tennyson's thought with that of Christ is 4The Works of Tennyson, with Notes by the Author, ed. Hallam, Lord Tennyson (New York, 1935), p. 975.</page><page sequence="9">HARRY PUCKETT 1 105 consequently in order. Eliot and Bradley err not in making that comparison but only in supposing that an isolated section or two of In Memoriam can be treated as some part of Tennyson's fixed credo. For Tennyson himself is the first to insist, in section XXXVI, that what appears in XXXIV and XXXV is inadequate: For Wisdom dealt with mortal powers, Where truth in closest words shall fail, When truth embodied in a tale Shall enter in at lowly doors. And so the Word had breath, and wrought With human hands the creed of creeds In loveliness of perfect deeds, More strong than all poetic thought- While Christianity is probably the "creed of creeds" that Tennyson speaks of, it is misleading to suppose that he is hereby stating his adherence to some- thing more or less equivalent to Eliot's creed. Eliot, at least, feels that Tennyson's sort of adherence is different from "belief," and that what Tennyson adheres to is different from the Incarnation: He was desperately anxious to hold the faith of the believer, without being very clear about what he wanted to believe: he was capable of illumination which he was incapable of understanding. The "Strong Son of God, immortal Love," with an invocation of whom the poem opens, has only a hazy connection with the Logos, or the Incarnate God. {Selected Essays, p. 292) Moreover, Tennyson makes it clear in numerous writings that the essential "faith" can exist in many different forms (see CXXVII and "The Ancient Sage"). To describe his own faith as "Christianity" would be to ascribe a more specific form to his creed than he himself assigned it: His creed, he always said, he would not formulate for people would not understand him if he did. . . . "It is impossible," he said, "to imagine that the Almighty will ask you, when you come before Him in the next life what your particular form of creed was: but the question will rather be, 'Have you been true to yourself, and given in My Name a cup of cold water to one of these little ones?' "5 At the same time, to say merely that Tennyson believed in Christianity is not specific enough. One may count himself a Christian and still not go through the highly self-critical refinement of will and imagination that Tennyson achieves in In Memoriam. The lyrics there show an intense preoccupation with precision of form- statement, image, and word- which would do Eliot honor. Tennyson's fundamental religious attitudes are inseparable from the exact form they find in In Memoriam. An important part of that form is the element of subjunctivity, which permits Tennyson to set up precise images of his "illumination" without making that absolute or exclusive commitment to them usually implied in the idea of religious belief. Hallam Tennyson, Alfred Lord Tennyson: A Memoir by His Son (New York, 1897), I, 308-309.</page><page sequence="10">106/ VICTORIAN POETRY This mode of expressing his attitudes was apparently a spontaneous feature of Tennyson's mind, as when he was cornered in argument. John Knowles reports such an instance, which strongly suggests the thought and image found in section XXXIV: He formulated once and quite deliberately his own religious creed in these words: "There's a something that watches over us; and our individuality endures: that's my faith, and that's all my faith." This he said with such a calm emphasis that I wrote it down (with the date) [not given] exactly and at once. But he was by no means always so calm. His belief in personal immortality was passionate-I think almost the strongest passion that he had. I have heard him thunder out against an opponent of it: "If there be a God that has made the earth and put this hope and passion into us, it must foreshow the truth. If it be not true, then no God, but a mocking fiend, created us, and" (growing crimson with excitement) "I'd shake my fist in his almighty face, and tell him that I cursed him! I'd sink my head to-night in a chloroformed handkerchief and have done with it all."6 When Knowles reports that Tennyson holds to a particular creed, or that he has a passionate belief in immortality, he is oversimplifying the way the poet's mind works. He seems not to notice the distinction Eliot perceives between a passionate belief in immortality and a passionate desire for it. He seems not to notice that Tennyson uses the subjunctive as a way to reinforce his passionate will to live and love. He consequently overlooks that most interesting feature of Tennyson's mind and poetry, which prompts him to maintain and develop a devout will, expressing that will in the most vivid and precise terms, while holding outright belief at arm's length. His son records a similarly subjunctive approach to individual immortality: Then he said earnestly: "If absorption into the divine in the after-life be the creed of some, let them at all events allow us many existences of individuality before this absorp- tion; since this short-lived individuality seems to be but too short a preparation for so mighty a union." (Memoir, I, 319) Thus, when Hallam Tennyson reports that his father consistently asserted a belief in immortality, it must be understood that such a belief could admit the possibility of personal extinction as the ultimate outcome. This possibility was further suggested to Tennyson by mystic experiences like the one described in section XCV, or the similar experiences described in the Memoir: "The individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this is not a confused state, but the clearest of the clearest, the surest of the surest, the weirdest of the weirdest, utterly beyond words, when death was an almost laughable impossibility, the loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction but the only true life." He continued: "I am ashamed of my feeble description. Have I not said the state is utterly beyond words? But in a moment, when I come back to my normal state of 'sanity,' I am ready to fight for mein liebes Ich, and hold that it will last for aeons of aeons." (Memoir, I, 320) 6"Aspects of Tennyson," The Nineteenth Century, 33 (1893), 169.</page><page sequence="11">HARRY PUCKETT 1 107 This clinging to mein liebes Ich is presented ironically, as occurring in a state of mind doubtfully referred to as "sanity," leaving open the possibility of a higher sanity achieved in mystic or meditative states rendering the "loss of personality (if so it were) . . . the only true life." Under the circumstances it is misleading to argue, as Bradley does, that Tennyson asserts a belief in personal immortality in sections XXXIV through XXXVI. In these sections Tennyson rather pointedly avoids such an assertion; and in view of his complex prose statements on the subject, which have their counterparts in various sections of In Memoriam, it is evident that the mere statement, "Tennyson believes in personal immortality," is so uninformative as to be virtually false. The sense of immediate and personal participation in eternal process achieved by the end of In Memoriam is much more far-reaching than anything usually meant by "personal immortality," even while that participa- tion and that process can also embrace the possibility of man's personal extinction- his ultimate absorption into "light" or "the divine" (XLVII). What Tennyson believes is not particularly important. Much more important is the way his mind and his poem work. The process is far more interesting than any particular outcome at any particular point. And to discuss Tennyson's mind as a set of beliefs, or to summarize In Memoriam as a set of conclusions- no matter how complexly stated- is to overlook the most distinguishing feature of both the mind and the poem. Section CXXVII and other later sections indicate Tennyson's sense of a faith that may persist through many changing forms, just as some of his prose statements argue the absurdity of making exclusive claims for any particular creed. These later sections are probably best regarded as states of mind that supersede, or at least temper, the state of mind in XXXVI, where Tennyson feels impelled to speak of a "creed of creeds." At the same time, any creed that might reason- ably be considered to rank this high is certainly higher than anything to be found in the first thirty -five sections of In Memoriam, and this is what Tennyson recognizes, not only in XXXVI but again in XXXVII, where he admits to having "darkened sanctities with song." These sections, of course, do not constitute an outright recantation. Much of XXXIV and XXXV remains valid to the end of In Memoriam, particularly Tennyson's emphasis on the overriding importance of love and his connection (however inverted) between love and immortality. The affirmation of these sections can stand; but it is a flawed affirmation, as Tennyson insists. Nothing so grievous as heresy is present here, and nothing so violent as recantation. The whole series from sections XXXIV to XXXVII is best understood as successive states of consciousness, all affirmative, which involve a gradual perfection of the will and the imagination. It is enough to notice at this point that by the end of In Memoriam the emphases that appear so important in XXXIV and XXXV have shifted; for at the end it is to "the living will" that Tennyson appeals- not to poetic thought, or truth, or belief.</page><page sequence="12">108 / VICTORIAN POETRY And his love seems no longer shakily grounded on an uncertain belief, or mere preference for belief, in immortality. Rather, it is his love for those around him and for all the world, with which Hallam is now "mingled," that keeps the memory and meaning of Hallam alive. The emphasis has shifted from thought to will, and from love as tottering superstructure to love as the ground of all being. The process of affirmation, self-scrutiny, and corrected affirmation characteristic of XXXIV through XXXVII as well as earlier sections of the poem thus epitomizes the general movement of In Memoriam. We cannot always be sure at any given point what eventually may be seen as flawed in any particular affirmation, nor can we always see precisely what is being withdrawn or corrected. Indeed, part of the interest of In Memoriam lies precisely in the fact that it frequently invites the reader to regard it as flawed, without providing specific or explicit answers to the inquiry thus instigated. The reader is consequently drawn into the process to discover for himself what may be weak or strong in the poem, and through that process to engage his own imagination as well as Tennyson's. To see the poem in this light is to see a very different poem from the one suggested by K. W. Gransden in his discussion of section XXXV: The poet rejects the fruitless hypothesis that Death is extinction: If death were seen At first as Death, Love had not been Or been in narrowest working shut ... Tennyson here adduces his own experience of love as evidence for immortality. To describe the poem in terms of "hypothesis" and "evidence" is to assign it the nature of a quasi-philosophical construct and to emphasize the quality of its logic rather than the quality of its imagination. Gransden, like Bradley, invites the attack of an Eliot by locating the value of the poem in the statement of "faith" to be found in particular sections, rather than in the process that makes the poem both interesting and valuable. Bradley does see, however, what Gransden does not: that Tennyson indeed fails to adduce evidence for immortality. Instead of committing the poet to any belief, or any other unshakable state of mind, the subjunctive permits him to set up states of mind which he can regard from a distance and, given that perspective, perhaps overthrow. To ignore that strategy is to misread the poem, as in the interpretation by Jerome H. Buckley, who indicates that in XXXV the poet "feels himself already 'half-dead to know that I shall die'."8 The words quoted here from the poem are actually attributed by Tennyson to Love, not to himself; and what is here paraphrased in the indicative- "feels himself half-dead"- is actually composed in the subjunctive: And Love would answer with a sigh, The sound of that forgetful shore Tennyson: In Memoriam (London, 1964), p. 53. ^Tennyson: The Growth of a Poet (Harvard Univ. Press, 1960), p. 112.</page><page sequence="13">HARRY PUCKETT 1 109 Will change my sweetness more and more, Half-dead to know that I shall die.' What Buckley treats as a direct expression of moribundity is in fact an active assertion of the poet's will against the loss and decay subjunctively postulated. In sections XXXIV and XXXV and in many other sections, the effect of the subjunctive is to create an absurd or decadent world, reflecting the poet's own sense of alienation and anxiety, while nonetheless keeping the poet himself at one remove from that world, thus allowing him to attack the very world he creates out of his own despair, and through this attack to make his affirmation. As in the series XXXIV through XXXVII it is evident that the affirmation, too, may be attacked or tempered. The tense, tentative approach to reality thus created is a major feature of In Memoriam, not to be underplayed. To turn either Tennyson's affirmation or his negations into flat, unconditional assertions, as Bradley, Gransden, and Buckley each tends to do in his own way, is to ignore the trial mode of both affirmation and negation which motivates and clears the way for the process of gradually perfected imagination that continues to the end of the poem. The subjunctive is not the only mood that gives In Memoriam its tentative quality. The interrogative and the imperative are also frequently used. But these are not so likely to be misread. A reader is not likely to suppose that a question or command is a statement of fact or belief. The subjunctive, however, offers a temptation to those with a tendency toward that "irritable reaching after fact and reason" that Keats deplored in his discussion of "Negative Capability." Most of us do have this tendency, and certainly Tennyson himself engages in a great deal of this "reaching after fact and reason," but just as often he rejects that activity, and ultimately he grounds his affirmation in a marriage of love and will. Ill The rejection of extravagant despair and images of loss is counterpointed in In Memoriam by the concurrent rejection of extravagant hopes and the imagination that gives them form. It is, therefore, inadequate (though true) to describe In Memoriam as a progress from despair to hope. Many sections in the early part of the poem are more hopeful, and present more specific and concrete images of hope, than the final sections, where the hopeful images are more subdued, though more cosmic. There Tennyson is less likely to imagine a private feast with Hallam-more likely to see Hallam as a "diffusive force" quickening all existence. Moreover, images of hope and the act of hoping tend to give way at the close of the poem to images of love and the act of loving- that is, to a different quality of will and imagination. Much of the hope that occurs early in In Memoriam may be described as fanciful, and this accounts for much of what the critics regard as "uneven" about the poem- but Tennyson is engaged in a movement away from cheap imaginings to a more genuine reconciliation.</page><page sequence="14">110/ VICTORIAN POETR Y Section XLVII illustrates the process of rejected hope in a particularly extreme form. Tennyson begins by subjunctively postulating a general merger of all souls into one Soul after death, then rejects this image: That each, who seems a separate whole, Should move his rounds, and fusing all The skirts of self again, should fall Remerging in the general Soul, Is faith as vague as all unsweet. He then goes on to declare flatly that he and Hallam shall retain separate identities after death and meet in that heaven which Eliot describes as a simple continuation of the joys of friendship upon earth: Eternal form shall still divide The eternal soul from all beside; And I shall know him when we meet: And we shall sit at endless feast, Enjoying each the other's good. Here Tennyson makes no use of the subjunctive; here would seem to be an outright, unconditional assertion of his "faith." But immediately in the following lines he alludes to this assertion as a dream, and he poses a question that moves him into a virtually total withdrawal from his previous vision: What vaster dream can hit the mood Of Love on earth? He seeks at least Upon the last and sharpest height, Before the spirits fade away, Some landing-place, to clasp and say, 'Farewell! We lose ourselves in light.' The possibility is thus left open for a kind of "remerging in the general Soul," which is just what the poet rejected early in the section as vague and unsweet. In the very next section, he makes a typical move, commenting on his own poetry, evidently quite alert to its limitations: If these brief lays, of Sorrow born, Were taken to be such as closed Grave doubts and answers here proposed, Then these were such as men might scorn. The question asked in the previous section-"What vaster dream can hit the mood of Love on earth?"- indicates the main problem of the poem in its dealings with images of hope. What imaginative construct-what "myth," we might say today- can embody the human condition and human fate in such a way as to equal our actual experience of "Love on earth"? The relation of In Memoriam to scientific movements of the nineteenth century has often been noted, and it should here be noted that Tennyson's problem in finding a suitable "dream" is rather like that of the scientist who, faced with a set of observable earthly and celestial facts, attempts to construct a theory adequate to the facts. Yet the difference between theory and myth needs to be emphasized. A theory may be proved; a myth is not something to be either proved or disproved. A myth is a construct used to integrate experiences that</page><page sequence="15">HARR Y PUCKETT /111 cannot apparently be integrated by hypotheses or theories or anything else subject to proof or disproof. And the integration is of some value only as it gives motion and direction to the will. An adequate myth or image produces and directs energy. If action and decision could be indefinitely postponed, we could do without myth entirely and live only by established theories and laws. Tennyson, however, is faced with certain problems of the will set forth early in In Memoriam- notably in sections XXXIV and XXXV- whether to go on living and how to go on loving. Given an active imagination, he must either remain stalled in images of loss and despair or send out sorties in search of hope. Yet even these sorties may be abortive; the imaginative work may produce images of hope inadequate to experience. These must then be rejected or temporarily put aside while the search continues. The difficulty is that neither Tennyson nor his reader has any rule for deciding what makes an image adequate. The process of locating adequacy is still largely intuitive. Coleridge's attempt to distinguish between Fancy and Imagination is only marginally useful; and later attempts, such as that by Wallace Stevens- incidentally, owing much to Coleridge- still leave us asking the question, "What is an adequate image or myth?"9 Like "What is justice?" the question may be unanswerable. The adequate image may be discoverable only through trial and error, and this, of course, is the method employed by Tennyson in In Memoriam. Other poems, too, find their success in trial and error, but what distinguishes In Memoriam-whzt indeed makes it an interesting poem- is the clear trail it leaves, not only inviting but challenging the reader (intentionally or not) to consider throughout what is adequate and what is not. The primary images of hope are those involving an imagined reunion with Hallam. In general the poem moves from the kind of reunion described in section XLVII- the kind Eliot attacks as merely "a continuance of the joys of friendship on earth"-to the mystic union of section XCV, and from there to a more complex union, occurring at the end of the poem, for which there is no ready label. Section XCV, which is sometimes regarded as the climax of the poem, should probably be regarded as only a part of and a way to the ultimate union.10 The experience of XCV is, at any rate, displaced if not rejected-although like other sections of In Memoriam which become suspect, Biographia Literaria, ed. John Shawcross (Oxford Univ. Press, 1907), p. 202; Wallace Stevens, "The Noble Rider and the Sound of Words," The Necessary Angel: Essays on Reality and the Imagination (London, 1960), pp. 1-36. Alan Sinfield, e.g., sees the section as climactic in his book, The Language of Tennyson's "In Memoriam" (Oxford, 1971), p. 82: "He is determined to construct a credible present relationship between himself and Hallam, but his attempts must ultimately fail because they have no basis other than common sense or wishful thinking. Only the vision of section XCV can provide a secure belief." Sinfield has two chapters on</page><page sequence="16">112/ VICTORIAN POETR Y it is not simply jettisoned. Something of XCV lives on in the remainder of the poem, as in the case of XXXIV and XXXV, which are called into question by XXXVI and XXXVII, but still remain as assertions of the values that continue to rule In Memoriam: love, will, the need for union, and some sense that the divine or natural process of which man is a primary vessel can never fundamentally be concluded. The "spirit" of these earlier sections still survives in the final sections, just as the spirit of Hallam survives finally in all that the poet sees and feels about him-just, indeed, as the spirit of the poet himself will survive in the higher race to come and that unnamed divine event of the Epilogue. In Memoriam is thus a microcosm of that evolutionary process whereby Hallam becomes a part of all in Tennyson's world, and both become a part, through death, of all that follows. Section XCV is a part of that process, a part of Tennyson's own progress. It is an important breakthrough certainly, but "stricken through with doubt"; and later, in section CXXII, it is flatly questioned and finally turned into a subjunctive experience. Insofar as the mystic experience of XCV survives, its survival is important mainly as a step toward the quasi-mystic union at the end of In Memoriam, where the spirit of Hallam is "mixed with God and Nature" (CXXX) and thus remains near though yet "far off." The movement toward this union begins, if not earlier, at least with section LXXXIV, where Tennyson recalls how Hallam would soon have married Tennyson's sister, Emily, and literally mingled his own blood with that of Tennyson: When thou shouldst link thy life with one Of mine own house, and boys of thine Had babbled 'Uncle' on my knee. The subjunctive "had" is typical here, with Tennyson futilely invoking images of a happiness that cannot be. He continues with the vision, however, at great length, carrying it on subjunctive ly to the point where he and Hallam die together and eventually Arrive at last the blessed goal, And He that died in Holy Land Would reach us out the shining hand, And take us as a single soul. The subjunctive "would" here, like other subjunctive pointers throughout the section, remind the reader of the problematical quality of these reflections; and the reader who has by this time become accustomed to Tennyson's rejection of futile fancies is not surprised at the concluding stanza: What reed was that on which I leant? Ah, backward fancy, wherefore wake The old bitterness again, and break The low beginnings of content. the syntax of In Memoriarh, both quite useful in understanding Tennyson's style of thought and perception, but they do not explore Tennyson's use of the subjunctive.</page><page sequence="17">HARR Y PUCKETT / 1 1 3 Ironically, then, this section adumbrates the ultimate reconciliation to be achieved by that mingling of Hallam's spirit with the world, yet the particular quality of imagination that dominates this section is rejected as a "backward fancy." The next section, LXXXV, carries on from this point with a different quality of imagination, suggesting in the space of 120 lines virtually all the elements that go to make up the final resolution of In Memoriam. Its importance is further indicated by the fact that Tennyson addresses it to his future brother-in-law, whose marriage to Cecilia is celebrated in the Epilogue. Edmund has inquired after the poet's well-being, asking what kind of life he leads: And whether trust in things above Be dimmed of sorrow, or sustained; And whether love for him [Hallam] have drained My capabilities of love. The central problem of In Memoriam is thus reasserted: not only whether Tennyson's love for Hallam might ironically destroy his power to go on loving, but whether human love itself is self-defeating in the face of human loss. Here, too, Tennyson acknowledges the central importance of will- "By which we dare to live or die." He continues to use Miltonic images of heaven despite earlier suggestions that these may be inadequate (e.g., XLVII). Here he goes so far as to use a Miltonic trademark, the capitalized common noun sandwiched between two adjectives: The great Intelligences fair That range above our mortal state, In circle round the blessed gate, Received and gave him welcome there; And led him through the blissful climes, And showed him in the fountain fresh All knowledge that the sons of flesh Shall gather in the cycled times. Tennyson does not explicitly reject this anthropomorphic and geographic perception of immortality. Instead he drops it. The sort of heaven or the sort of immortality that Eliot objected to as bodying forth a mere extension of life on earth is used only once again in In Memoriam (CIII), and there it is not only explicitly identified as a dream but in addition bears all the marks of a dream- allegory. Section LXXXV, in effect, ends one style of imagination and inaugurates another. The new style, which remains dominant to the end of In Memoriam, appears in Tennyson's new sense of eternity as something which he has experienced and continues to experience, not merely in his love of Hallam but in a continued love of life on earth: I woo your love: I count it crime To mourn for any overmuch; I, the divided half of such A friendship as had mastered Time;</page><page sequence="18">114/ VICTORIAN POETR Y Which masters Time indeed, and is Eternal, separate from fears. (LXXXV) He indicates more precisely in what sense the relationship is eternal, invoking the seasons to indicate that they themselves, through Hallam, are a part of eternity; and in so doing, he once again suggests the now-dominant theme- the suffusion of Hallam through all his life: But Summer on the steaming floods And Spring that swells the narrow brooks, And Autumn, with a noise of rooks, That gather in the waning woods, And every pulse of wind and wave Recalls, in change of light or gloom, My old affection of the tomb, And my prime passion in the grave. (LXXXV) While the tone of Hallam's presence remains essentially sad, in the next few stanzas Tennyson holds converse with that presence and feels himself being urged to "seek / A friendship for the years to come." Hallam continues to speak, as if immortal and present: And lightly does the whisper fall; °Tis hard for thee to fathom this; I triumph in conclusive bliss, And that serene result of all.' Not only is his "triumph" here described in far more general terms than earlier, in the Miltonic passages, but Tennyson goes on in the next stanza once again to render his own experience subjunctive: So hold I commerce with the dead; Or so methinks the dead would say; Or so shall grief with symbols play And pining life be fancy-fed. Still remaining, however, is the spirit of that subjunctive experience- the sense that he must reach out to the living, and he does reach out to Edmund apologetically, his love for Hallam still working as both drag and motive. Still to come is that final reconciliation, in which the poet's love for Hallam fully unites with and motivates his love for the life and people around him. Thus, the mystic experience of section XCV needs to be seen as part of the process begun at least as early as LXXXIV or LXXXV, in which the friendship with Hallam takes on the aspect of eternity in the present. It takes on this eternal aspect partly because of Tennyson's intuitive sense that the relationship is simply inconclusible, and in part because that relationship has set off a train of relations with other people which, particularly through the marriage of Edmund and Cecilia, stretches into the indefinite future, even as Tennyson's relation to the dead Hallam establishes a relation with the past, through all evolutionary time- a relation with all that has died to make the poet's existence and his love possible. By comparison with this sense of eternity, existing in every present moment yet connecting all time and so transcending all time, a fugitive mystic experience like that of XCV seems not climactic but only contributory.</page><page sequence="19">HARRY PUCKETT 1 115 Tennyson is acutely conscious of the limitations and dangers of mystic states. Section XC appeals to Hallam: Ah, dear, but come thou back to me: Whatever change the years have wrought, I find not yet one lonely thought That cries against my wish for thee. Section XCI repeats the plea, urging that Hallam appear in visible form, and specifically in the form by which Tennyson knew him on earth. But the following section, XCII, withdraws that plea, postulating subjunctively Hallam's appearance, and asserting with another subjunctive the poet's mistrust: If any vision should reveal Thy likeness, I might count it vain As but the canker of the brain. Section XCIII asserts flatly: I shall not see thee. No visual shade of some one lost, But he, the Spirit himself, may come Where all the nerve of sense is numb; Spirit to Spirit, Ghost to Ghost. At this point, then, Tennyson has rejected his earlier plea of XCI, that Hallam might come in visible form; in rejecting that plea he achieves a purer will- not ultimately pure, of course, but a grade above that expressed in previous stanzas. He arrives at the position held by virtually all the great mystics- that the seeing of visions and hearing of voices is an inferior sort of mystic experience.11 It is rather in the absence of sense experience- "Where all the nerve of sense is numb"- that the highest union occurs. With this observation Tennyson moves closer to that view of Hallam as a "diffusive power" (CXXX), the view that brings In Memoriam to conclusion. It is in this invisible form that the union of section XCV occurs- if indeed a union occurs. Tennyson's experience in this section is certainly crucial, but it is also dubious in several ways. In the first place, if it is a union with Hallam, then it is inferior to mystic experience as traditionally under- stood, an experience involving unibn with God or the Absolute, not merely a lone se'ance in which one enjoys a few moments with the dead. It is significant in this connection that Tennyson altered lines thirty-six and thirty-seven after the poem was originally published, substituting "the" and "this" for "his," thereby suggesting a more general, less personal union than that of the first edition (Bradley, p. 242). Tennyson's uncertainty about the nature of this experience is further suggested by his introducing it with "seemed": "it seemed at last / The living soul was flashed on mine." The X1F. L. Cross, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (Oxford Univ. Press, 1958), p. 936.</page><page sequence="20">116/ VICTORIAN POETR Y experience comes to an end when it is "stricken through with doubt," and it is consequently framed in expressions of uncertainty. Section CXXII casts further doubt when it asks whether in fact the poet was united with Hallam in the experience of XCV (or some experience very much like it): Oh, wast thou with me, dearest, then, While I rose up against my doom, And yearned to burst the folded gloom, To bare the eternal Heavens again. Later in this section the whole experience becomes subjunctive: If thou wert with me, and the grave Divide us not, be with me now. It would seem most reasonable to suppose that this section refers to the experience of section XCV, since no other experience like it is described in the poem, and because XCV itself suggests the dubious nature of the experience (Bradley argues in favor of the view that CXXII refers to XCV [pp. 219-221] ). But regardless of which mystic or quasi-mystic experience it refers to, this section points up the uncertainty of such experience- a subject Tennyson explores at length in "The Holy Grail," where both Lancelot and Percivale are tormented by the ambiguity of their visionary experiences (11. 563-849). This story explores not only the uncertainties but also the dangers inherent in mystic experience, the most important of these dangers being that the mystic may lose touch with the human order: Percivale leaves the Round Table to enter a monastery, while Galahad leaves the earthly order entirely to enter a spiritual realm. Arthur had earlier prophesied loss and disorder if the Quest were carried through, and at the end of the story he reviews that prediction: And out of those to whom the vision came My greatest hardly will believe he saw. Another hath beheld it afar off, And, leaving human wrongs to right themselves, Cares but to pass into the silent life. And one hath had the vision face to face, And now his chair desires him here in vain, However they may crown him otherwhere. (11. 891-898) Section CVIII of In Memoriam expresses virtually identical concerns: I will not shut me from my kind, And, lest I stiffen into stone, I will not eat my heart alone, Nor feed with sighs a passing wind: What profit lies in barren faith, And vacant yearning, though with might To scale the heaven's highest height, Or dive below the wells of Death? What find I in the highest place, But mine own phantom chanting hymns? And on the depths of death there swims The reflex of a human face.</page><page sequence="21">HARRY PUCKETT / 117 Neither Arthur nor Tennyson, however, rejects mystic experience. Although Arthur sees it as his first business to guard and rule the land, he still values transcendent experience : moments when he feels he cannot die, And knows himself no vision to himself, Nor the high God a vision, nor that One Who rose again. (11. 912-915) Likewise, in the very section (CXXII) where Tennyson calls his mystic experience into question and then renders it merely subjunctive, he still cries out for Hallam's presence. Moreover, the extraordinary force and beauty of section XCV, if there were no other test, draws such positive attention to the experience that the reader can hardly suppose it is meant to be dismissed. At the same time, it is obviously not the resolution of the conflicts set up in In Memoriam. One needs only to see the reconciliation presented in the last few sections of the poem to see the shortcomings of the mystic experience. As section CJCXII indicates, the experience is both fleeting and dubious, and the poet is still left crying for his friend's presence. The mystic union can be achieved only by moving out of the everyday world, the world that both Percivale and Galahad did leave in pursuit of vision; but the final sections find the poet very much a part of this world, like the Arthur of "The Holy Grail." Hallam, too, is a part of this world- not simply a spirit from another world paying a momentary visit to this- but mingled with God and Nature, and therefore constantly present to the poet. He is also present in the people of this world, and his presence there makes them dearer, though this point is not emphasized until the Epilogue. In section CXXIII, immediately following the poet's cry for Hallam's presence, it appears that he will retreat from this world, where the hills are seen to be as insubstantial as the mist: But in my spirit will I dwell And dream my dream, and hold it true; For though my lips may breathe adieu, I cannot think the thing farewell. He continues, however, with what he describes as an almost wilful assertion of the primacy of his own feelings, like that of a "man in wrath" or a "child in doubt and fear." The claims of love are reiterated in CXXVI, and in section CXXIX the poet echoes CXXIII, again arguing the ultimate reality of the dream but now with a different result. No longer does he take the stand that "in my spirit will I dwell / And dream my dream, and hold it true." Rather the dream has become a way out to the world: Strange friend, past, present, and to be; Loved deeplier, darklier understood; Behold, I dream a dream of good, And mingle all the world with thee.</page><page sequence="22">118/ VICTORIAN POETR Y The following section (CXXX) draws In Memoriam nearer to its conclusion with the assertion of Hallam's eternal presence-not in a fleeting, passionate, mystical experience- but in a daily converse with all the world: Thy voice is on the rolling air; I hear thee where the waters run; Thou standest in the rising sun, And in the setting thou art fair. What art thou then? I cannot guess; But though I seem in star and flower To feel thee some diffusive power, I do not therefore love thee less: My love involves the love before; My love is vaster passion now; Though mixed with God and Nature thou, I seem to love thee more and more. Far off thou art, but ever nigh; I have thee still, and I rejoice; I prosper, circled with thy voice; I shall not lose thee though 1 die. What Tennyson describes here is not at all the mere "continuance of the joys of friendship upon earth." The presence of a sense of Eternal Life is here, which, if not explicitly or especially Christian, is nonetheless equal to Christianity in scope and nobility. A sense of the poet's having found himself alive in eternity now exists. If Hallam is "mixed with God and Nature"- whatever that might entail, whether personal immortality or not-the poet, too, or his consciousness, is mixed with that same God and Nature, and will be (like Hallam) when he dies. The mystic union has not been rejected; it has rather been developed and expanded into a union not merely momentary but perpetual, involving not merely the unseen Absolute but also this world, Nature, and the spirit of the dead. Likewise, the relatively crude perceptions and priorities of sections XXXIV and XXXV have been refined and rearranged. That tantrum-like insistence on personal immortality as a precondition of love, has been transformed into a sense of perpetual union, a sense even of Eternal Life at least as fine as Eliot's, achieved through love, and not merely love of Hallam but love of God and Nature. Tennyson's emphasis on evolution is important here, particularly as it appears in section CXVIII, for the spirit of man is there seen as related to, or inherent in, the primal heat, the solid earth that developed from it, and the animals that arose from earth. The preceding section (CXVII) presents a naive, childlike sense of time as something wilfully separating the poet from Hallam: O days and hours, your work is this To hold me from my proper place, A little while from his embrace, For fuller gain of after bliss.</page><page sequence="23">HARR Y PUCKETT / 1 1 9 But in the following section (CXVIII) a much saner, less egocentric, more comprehensive sense of time appears. The section opens with the injunction, "Contemplate all this work of Time," and goes on to describe an evolution that begins before life itself and before the earth was formed: They say, The solid earth whereon we tread In tracts of fluent heat began, And grew to seeming-random forms, The seeming prey of cyclic storms, Till at the last arose the man ; Who throve and branched from clime to clime, The herald of a higher race, And of himself in higher place, If so he type this work of time. The subjunctive "if makes it uncertain whether man can indeed achieve a "higher place." But what stands out as particularly interesting is that, when Tennyson sees himself and Hallam as ultimately mixed with God and Nature, diffused as force into "star and flower," he essentially sees them as returning to that from which they emerged; and this idea is made explicit in the final line of the final section (CXXXI). Hallam's personal identity is mixed not merely with God but with Nature as well. Mingled with the world, he becomes a "diffusive power," a part of that energy which originally willed him out of the earth, willed man himself from out of fire and rock. "God and Nature" is the rubric under which this energy moves, but it is the energy itself, the will, that Tennyson addresses in the final section. It is this will, "the higher and most enduring part of man," of Hallam and of Tennyson, that still survives in spite of death, and would presumably survive even the obliteration of the species (which Tennyson has anticipated subjunctively in section LVI). That will which had been embodied in Hallam lives still in that from which Hallam arose; that from which he arose will go on willing new men, new races of men, new beings superior to men. It lives, too, in the poet. And just as that will once drove through the rock to make a man, so it continues to drive through Tennyson, through the "spiritual rock," the resistant stuff through which the will must forge its way to higher being, and at the same time the foundation of all being. The condition asserted in the Prologue has thus been fulfilled: "Our wills are ours, we know not how; / Our wills are ours to make them thine." As Bradley notes, the "living will" that Tennyson addresses in the final numbered section (CXXXI) he describes in the Memoir (I, 319) as "Free-will, the higher and enduring part of man." But this will is "Heaven-descended" (the phrase comes from the poem "Will") and the "Main-miracle, apparently an act of self-limitation of the Infinite, and yet a revelation of Himself by</page><page sequence="24">120/ VICTORIAN POETRY Himself (Bradley, p. 236). Both the will of the dead Hallam and the will of the living poet are united not only with the will of God but with the will of Nature. What any Christian with Eliot's bent for orthodoxy must find unwelcome, as Eliot indeed does, is the emphasis on physical being and physical history as an element in Tennyson's final reconciliation: That strange abstraction, "Nature," becomes a real god or goddess, perhaps more real, at moments, to Tennyson than God ("Are God and Nature then at strife?"). The hope of immortality is confused (typically of the period) with the hope of the gradual and steady improvement of this world. {Selected Essays, pp. 292-293) If there is any confusion, it is not in Tennyson's poetry. The evident answer to the question Eliot lifts arbitrarily and hastily from section LV is that, in the final stanzas of In Memoriam, God and Nature are not at strife, but rather share a common will, with which Hallam is united in death and Tennyson in life. Moreover, there seems to be no confusion about immortality or human, improvement. All Nature is engaged in an evolution of new selves, which often involves the sloughing of the old. From this tendency, this energy, man flows, and he bears the marks of his birth. He, too, is engaged- as the poet is engaged in In Memoriam- m a continual transcendence of the old self, a continual development of new selves. At death, and at those moments in life when he is most fully alive, man flows back to that from which he came. Or, more precisely, that "higher and enduring part of man," his will, flows back to reunite with the primal will, as Tennyson explicitly indicates in the closing lines of the final numbered section. But that union of wills is no longer confined to fleeting quasi-mystic experience, though it does not exclude such experience. Nor is it limited to a union through death. It becomes a part of daily life and death: more precisely, it becomes a perpetual possibility, which is realized only when it is willed, as the subjunctivity of the final section (CXXXI) suggests: 0 living will that shalt endure When all that seems shall suffer shock, Rise in the spiritual rock, Flow through our deeds and make them pure, That we may lift from out of dust A voice as unto him that hears, A cry above the conquered years To one that with us works, and trust, With faith that comes of self-control, The truths that never can be proved Until w.e close with all we loved, And all we flow from, soul in soul. When Tennyson speaks of closing with all he loves, he is certainly no longer speaking naively of a continuation of the joys of friendship on earth, as the previous section (CXXX) indicates: My love involves the love before; My love is vaster passion now; Though mixed with God and Nature thou, 1 seem to love thee more and more.</page><page sequence="25">HARRY PUCKETT / 121 It is absurd to speak now, as Eliot does, of a competition between God and Nature. The suggestion of such a competition, which Eliot finds in LV, has been transcended in a unified perception of eternal process encompassing God and Nature in their action upon all past and future time. The process is epitomized in thfe movement whereby Hallam's death leads the poet to a vaster life and will. That will is eternal and yet appears both in the temporal workings of Nature and also in the temporal work of the poet, who wills himself through flawed perceptions and "dead selves" to finer perception and a more perfect will. To argue, as Eliot does, that Tennyson is more concerned with the loss of man than he is with the gain of God is absurd, since the loss of man is now taken for granted as part of the eternal process manifested in every moment. A sense of Eternal Life could hardly be more evident or more immediate. A Christian of Eliot's sort, with a clearly articulated credo, might well maintain that a "sense" of Eternal Life is not at all the same thing as a clear belief in Eternal Life- and might therefore still maintain that Tennyson's faith is a "poor thing." Any dispute on this score tends to be extraliterary; and it must, in any case, reach an impasse. For it is precisely a "sense," or as Tennyson might say, a "feeling" of Eternal Life that the poem works toward- not precisely a belief. That point appears explicitly throughout In Memoriam, but most emphatically in CXXIV: If e'er when faith had fallen asleep, I heard a voice, 'believe no more,' And heard an ever-breaking shore That tumbled in the Godless deep; A warmth within the breast would melt The freezing reason's colder part, And like a man in wrath the heart Stood up and answered, 'I have felt.' No, like a child in doubt and fear: But that blind clamor made me wise; Then was I as a child that cries, But, crying, knows his father near; And what I am beheld again What is, and no man understands; And out of darkness came the hands That reach through nature, moulding men. The section emphasizes feeling as a way toward an act of beholding or sensing, though evidently an intuitive sensation, which in turn has the effect of tapping that will which reaches through nature to mould men. Feeling and intuition lead to alterations of the will, and if for no other reason than this, Tennyson is much concerned to discriminate one feeling or intuition from another. Many of the lyrics in In Memoriam are primarily ways of trying on a feeling subjunctive ly to see if it fits, and many such feelings are rejected as not fitting, though usually some part survives to generate or help constitute another feeling. The poem suggests that, once the primacy of feeling</page><page sequence="26">122 / VICTORIAN POETRY (particularly love) and will is accepted, then a process of discrimination is entered upon which is practically not to be concluded. This process appears for Tennyson to be the "Way."12 It is not "the Way and the Life" as Eliot understands it, but it is the way of Nature, as Tennyson insists, and it seems to be a way that not only Tennyson but many of his readers find compelling. It is not a Way in which one is ever likely to find a point of rest, or what Eliot calls "the still point of the turning world."13 It is difficult to see how the process could end except in death, and the point of In Memoriam is that not even death ends the process in its larger sense, but only alters the level on which it proceeds. No wonder, then, that In Memoriam seems to be a difficult poem to end. The subjunctivity of the final numbered section makes it clear that the poet foresees the continued need of that "living will"- in himself, in Nature, in God- as a condition for further acts of trust, love, and articulation, "That we may lift from out of dust / A voice." Moreover, the Epilogue, like the Prologue, calls into question the entire main body of In Memoriam, although the Epilogue does so in a blundering way unlike the carefully wrought Prologue. The last three stanzas of the Prologue suggest that, from a higher perspective, even those parts of the poem which appear to have merit may appear faulty. The Epilogue, too, suggests that the poet has reached a vantage point from which the poem seems of little importance: For I myself with these have grown To something greater than before; Which makes appear the songs I made As echoes out of weaker times, As half but idle brawling rhymes, The sport of random sun and shade. Such lines suggest that not even the last of the numbered sections is exempt from the judgment that it may be partial or inadequate. Certainly the subjunctivity of that section makes it clear that the poet has not arrived at the perfected imagination, the perfected will. Rather he invokes the will in order that certain acts and attitudes may ensue. The process begun by the first few sections of In Memoriam is by no means completed, and it is difficult to see just how it could be completed. The Epilogue indicates clearly just how much work yet remains to be accomplished, for here Tennyson turns away from his preoccupation with his own inner life- his own imagination and his own will- to the lives of others. 1 2 Tennyson commonly referred to In Memoriam as "The Way of a Soul": Memoir, I, 393. The image appears both in Coriolan and in "Burnt Norton," and with slight modification in Murder in the Cathedral, all in The Complete Poems and Plays, 1909-1950 (New York, 1952), pp. 86, 119, and 182 respectively.</page><page sequence="27">HARRY PUCKETT 1 123 This turn in the poem calls attention to the predominantly introverted quality of In Memoriam, and particularly of the last several numbered sections-notably section CXXX, with its repeated reference to "I" and "my," and section CXXXI, which despite the shift to "us" and "we" remains a personal plea. From a vantage outside the main body of the poem- a vantage provided by the Epilogue- even these great concluding sections may be understood as states of mind which the poet now sees as limited or flawed. Ironically, they may be flawed by that very preoccupation with the self that made a great poem, but which the poet turns from in the Epilogue with a tone just short of disdain. Most importantly, he does simply turn away. Having described In Memoriam as "echoes out of weaker times," he might have gone on to seek a new will, a new quality of imagination, out of that conflict between his preoccupation with self and his need to participate in the world about him. Instead comes the simple turning away: But where is she, the bridal flower, That must be made a wife ere noon? She enters, glowing like the moon Of Eden on its bridal bower. The process itself must be put aside in order that the poet may take part in the life around him. Strictly speaking, it does not lead to the joy he feels in the marriage; it rather takes on the quality of a purgative- a way to put aside one set of feelings so that another set may hold sway. Even the presence of Hallam is never equal to the pervasive presence announced in CXXX. His presence in the Epilogue is private and conjectural, and it generates in Tennyson a slight sense of guilt: And hearts are warmed and faces bloom, As drinking health to bride and groom We wish them store of happy days. Nor count me all to blame if I Conjecture of a stiller guest, Perchance, perchance, among the rest, And, though in silence, wishing joy. Once again, the level of experience and imagination achieved in the main body of In Memoriam seems to exist only apart from the marriage scene, and to some extent in conflict with it. The very failure of the Epilogue to integrate the process and results of the numbered sections with the marriage scene eloquently suggests that Tennyson still has a great deal of work to do, if he cares to do it- that In Memoriam is not, in any inevitable or even satisfactory way, concluded. Tennyson himself, no doubt reasoning from other grounds, felt the same: It's too hopeful, this poem, more than I am myself. . . . The general way of its being written was so queer that if there were a blank space I would put in a poem. ... I think of adding another to it, a speculative one, bringing out the thoughts of the "Higher Pantheism," and shewing that all the arguments are about as good on one side as the other, and thus throw man back more on the primitive impulses and feelings.

It offers much encouragement, however, and some excellent models, toward a "Way" whereby the imagination may gradually, painstakingly, though with devotion, redirect itself and so redirect the will. In his peculiarly halting and self- doubting manner, Tennyson thus finds a place alongside such poets as Keats in the nineteenth century or Pound and Stevens in the twentieth century, who see the aesthetic process, the perfected imagination, as a way of transcending our inability to know and the difficulties of belief. This process in In Memoriam is thus more important than any position arrived at anywhere in the poem, and it seems unlikely that the process could be concluded in any convincing manner. It is customary, of course, to give a poem a sense of finality at the end, whatever the end, and Tennyson seems to have made an unsuccessful attempt at this in his Epilogue. In the twentieth century it is customary to cope with such a problem through the use of symbol and paradox, as Eliot does in the concluding lines of Four Quartets: We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. And all shall be well And all manner of thing shall be well When the tongues of flame are in-folded Into the crowned knot of fire And the fire and the rose are one.14 This is superb poetry; but it might reasonably be argued that the sense of finality and ultimate achievement in Four Quartets is less instructive and less convincing than Tennyson's botched attempt to conclude a process that his imagination indicated was not to be concluded in any conceivable lifetime.</page></plain_text>
