<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNUSUAL PARTNERS, SYMBIOSIS IN THE LIVING WORLD, Alvin and Virginia B. Silverstein, 64 pp., $4.50, Mc- Graw-Hill Book Company, New York, 1968. This is an interesting and well- written book suitable for the upper elementary and junior high school years. In addition to providing back- ground on commensalism, mutualism and parasitism, there are some other important ideas communicated, ideas about incertitude in science, the con- tinuing quest for scientific knowledge, and the ways in which scientists go about finding things out. This is done unobtrusively and effectively. It is un- fortunate that an otherwise commend- able presentation is marred by an oc- casional anthropomorphism. H.G.</page></plain_text>
