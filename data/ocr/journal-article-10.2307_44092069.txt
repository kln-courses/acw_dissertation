HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE BY Dr. Deena Grant Barry University, USA DGrant@mail.barry.edu Summary Anger is a pervasive theme throughout biblical literature compelling both God and humans to lash out destructively. We survey a wide range of biblical passages in order to identify the characteristics of human anger. We observe that anger is, almost exclusively, the response of an authority figure to disre- garded authority whose expression is aimed at reasserting compromised or threatened authority. We observe also that the outcomes of human anger are predictable, depending, primarily, on the relationship between the angered party and his provoker. Sommaire La colère est un thème répandu tout au long du texte biblique, forçant aussi bien Dieu que les hommes à s'agresser. Nous parcourrons un vaste éventail de textes afin d'identifier les caractéristiques de la colère humaine. Elle est pres- que toujours la réponse d'une personne ayant autorité à un manquement à l'autorité; elle vise à rétablir cette autorité menacée ou compromise. Nous voyons aussi que les résultats de la colère humaine sont prévisibles, dépendant essentiellement de la relation entre le provoqué et le provocateur. Introduction Anger is a pervasive theme throughout biblical literature compelling both God and humans to lash out destructively. However, since anger is ascribed to God, by far more frequently than it is attributed to man, scholars and theologians have tended to limit their explorations of the Bible's anger motif to divine anger. Work on anger has focused on posi- tively distinguishing God's just anger from self-serving human anger or on reconciling God's anger with His presumed righteousness. In</page><page sequence="2">340 DEENA GRANT contrast, few attempts have been made to parse out the nature of human anger in the Bible.1 We find this surprising given that ancient notions of human anger likely influence anthropopathic depictions of divine anger. In this article, we help to fill in the gap in research by examining hu- man anger on its own terms, with an eye toward discerning anger's liter- ary function. Methodologically, our examination of human anger is rep- resentative, not comprehensive. We choose our examples from a wide range of passages and across a variety of biblical genres and time peri- ods because we aim to identify the characteristics of human anger that apply globally throughout the Bible. We do not aim to parse out the pre- cise differences in anger's definition among various biblical sources. In addition, we include in our investigation only those texts wherein anger terms appear in order to ensure consistency within the evidence base. Nevertheless, we do not examine the differing nuances of definition among the various anger terms. This has already been done and, in any case, would divert us from our broader investigation.2 Our examination of human anger in the Bible yields two interesting conclusions. First, biblical anger is, almost exclusively, the response of an authority figure to disregarded authority. Second, the potential out- comes of anger are wide ranging, though not unpredictable. We believe that the consequence of anger is not tied to the biblical source (for in- stance, whether it be deuteronomistic or prophetic). Nor does it depend, primarily, on the nature of the offense. In fact, the same offenses that elicit benign anger in one instance provoke lethal anger in another.3 Rather, the outcome of human anger depends on the relationship be- tween the angered party and his provoker. Throughout the Bible, an- gered people tend to respond lethally to provokers who are not members of their native communities, and benignly to provokers who are kin. In- terestingly, anger at kin typically foreshadows a more extreme loss of authority for the provoked. 1 The exception is Bruce Baloian, Anger in the Old Testament (American Univer- sity Studies; New York: P. Lang, 1992). Baloian examines human anger with the aim of contrasting it with divine anger. 2 Our set of terms conforms with those terms that are defined as "anger" according to Brown-Driver-Briggs Lexicon of the O.T. and the Theological Dictionary of the O.T.

According to a dominant approach within the field of cognitive psychology, human anger is a response to an attack on social status that leads to feelings of weakness and inferiority. Aaron Beck, one of the earliest proponents of the cognitive approach, explains that a self-perception of weakness and inferiority compels an angered party to punish the individual whom he believes diminished his social status and self-esteem.4 Through reprisal, an angered individual will at- tempt to dominate his provoker and, by this, restore a sense of status and control.5 The biblical portrait of human anger accords with this understanding. The Bible ascribes anger to people in positions of political or domestic power (i.e. patriarchs and kings) who face disregarded or threatened authority. While it is not unexpected that biblical anger is attributed to authority figures (especially since a large proportion of biblical person- alities hold positions of power)6 it is surprising that the Bible reserves anger language for this one category of individual - authority figures who face disregarded or threatened authority.7 In fact, out of the twenty- six named individuals who become angry in the Bible, twenty-one are kings, leaders, masters or high ranking family members. It seems then, 4 Cognitive theory of psychology asserts that an emotional response is not simply a reaction to a pre-determined set of behaviors, but rather, derives from the meaning an individual ascribes to these behaviors. Therefore, in order to understand the biblical conception of anger, the angered parties' interpretations of incendiary behaviors must be clarified. Once the meanings ascribed to provocative behaviors are elucidated, the purposes and consequences of biblical anger can be understood more clearly. Aaron T. Beck, Prisoners of Hate: The Cognitive Basis of Anger, Hostility , and Violence (New York: HarperCollins, 1999) 32-33. 5 Peter Lyman, Review of James Averill, "Anger and Aggression: An Essay on Emotion," Contemporary Sociology 13 no. 2 (1984) 202-03. 6 In his book Emotion and Adaptation , the cognitive psychologist Richard Lazarus similarly describes anger as an attempt to preserve ego-identity in response to an assault on one's ego-identity. Lazarus claims further that anger is inhibited when there is fear that the person toward whom one is angry is powerful enough to retaliate. As such, an- ger is usually expressed toward someone lower in the hierarchy whose ready defeat can confer a feeling of self-assertion and invulnerability. Richard S. Lazarus, Emotion and Adaptation (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991). 7 Possible exceptions include 1 Sam 1:6 (though Hannah's status as the preferred wife may grant her authority), Gen 31:36, Job 32:5 and Jonah 4:1-9 (though, in these cases, the angered parties perceive themselves to possess authority supported by Yah weh).</page><page sequence="4">342 DEENA GRANT that biblical anger is conceived in more limited terms than modern psychological theory would lead us to expect. We propose this definition for human anger in the Bible: An experi- ence of displeasure over disregarded or abused authority that, in a predictable set of contexts, precipitates punitive - primarily lethal - acts of violence. Such acts are aimed at reasserting authority over a compro- mised or threatened domain of control .8 Whereas anger is triggered, typically, by a singular underlying offense - disregarded authority - it has a wide range of potential out- comes that range from lethal to innocuous. The severity of anger's outcome depends, almost exclusively, on the relationship between an angered party and his provoker, and has little or no bearing on the na- ture of the offense. Passages that depict lethal anger tend to point out that the provoker is neither an immediate family member nor a member of the angered party's ethno-community. We suggest that the emphasis on the 'outsider-ness' of a provoker serves as a rationalization for lethal anger. Since the angered party assumes he cannot compel his foreign provoker to respect his socially mandated authority, and since he has no familial affection to mitigate his anger, he takes lethal action. By killing his provoker and/or multiple members of his provoker's family or com- munity, an angered party demonstrates that he punishes violators of his domain. By this, he reasserts his authority and dissuades other potential provokers. By contrast, anger at kin typically affects no consequences at all, re- gardless of the nature of the offense. We suggest that the benign nature of family anger is due to self-interest and affection. Since the safety, wealth, and wellbeing of a family leader, such as a patriarch, are defined by the familial group, lethal anger would be self-destructive. Affection prevails and anger is curtailed because the family bond is essential to survival. However, anger language in a family context foreshadows an im- pending loss of authority. Provocation by kin is a sign that the authority structure of the family is eroding from within. On top of this, the senti- ment and self interest that defines family relationships diminishes the force and efficacy of a patriarch's anger at his kin, rendering him unpre- pared to act in a forceful enough way to prevent his own loss of author- ity. 8 We define authority as dominance or control over the behavior of an individual or group.</page><page sequence="5">HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE 343 The Passages Given that relatedness predicts the consequences of anger, we divide our discussion of passages into categories of relatedness. First, we ex- amine the lethal nature of anger at outsiders (Gen 34, Judg 14, Dan 3). Then, we explore the benign character of anger at family members (Gen 27, 1 Sam 20, 2 Sam 13). Finally, we offer exegesis of two passages that, on the face of things, appear to pose exceptions to our two catego- ries (Gen 39 and Gen 4).9 Anger at an Outsider Throughout the Bible, anger at outsiders is lethal. Since, it is as- sumed, outsiders cannot be compelled to respect the native authority structure, angered parties take lethal action in a public show of power, aimed at annulling the threat and preventing future disregard. Genesis 34:1-31 Brothers Assert Authority In Genesis 34, Shehem provokes the anger of Dinah's brothers by having relations with her (Vmora Ì1CT nVai-O *TNa DflV "tm; v. 7). Dinah's brothers respond to the "outrage in Israel" by massacring Shehem's town (vv. 25-29). The aim of their lethal act of anger may be better understood in light of one of the only two other passages in the Hebrew Bible in which an "outrage in Israel" incites lethal anger.10 In Joshua 7, Yahweh becomes angry (Vniœt mrv «1K - in1!; v.l) when Ahan commits an "outrage in Israel" by stealing vessels that are devoted to Yahweh (Vinera nVai; v 15). In response to Ahan's disre- gard for Yahweh's exclusive rights to the vessels, Yahweh kills him, his family, and threatens to kill his entire community, the people of Israel (vv. 25-32). Yahweh's act of anger at this "outrage" has a public, instructive aim. Yahweh demands that all the people of Israel witness and even partici- pate in the execution of Ahan, the thief who violated His sanctuary 9 Other examples of anger at outsiders include Gen 44:18 (Judah assumes Joseph perceives him as a foreigner) Esth 3:5 and 7:7. Other examples of anger at family in- clude Gen 30:2, 31:35, 45:5, 1 Sam 1:6-7, 17:28 and Esth 1:1. 10 There are only three passages in the Hebrew Bible in which an "outrage" in Israel provokes anger. The third is 2 Samuel 13.</page><page sequence="6">344 DEENA GRANT domain (vv. 24-25). Moreover, He does not turn away His anger imme- diately after He executes His provoker. Yahweh's anger abates only af- ter the people erect a permanent monument that publicizes the conse- quences of provoking the deity's anger (v. 26). Thus it seems that Yahweh's lethal anger is a demonstration of power aimed at dissuading the Israelites from violating his domain in the future. Just as Ahan commits an "outrage in Israel" by ignoring Yahweh's exclusive rights to the Tabernacle vessels, Shehem commits an "outrage in Israel" by disregarding Jacob's family proprietorship over Dinah. In view of the similarly lethal outcomes of anger over an "outrage," the public aim of Yahweh's act of anger likely applies to Dinah's brothers' act of anger as well. By massacring Shehem 's town, the brothers dem- onstrate - perhaps to the surrounding towns - the severe consequences of arousing their anger by committing an "outrage" in Israel. The broth- ers acknowledge as much in their response to their father's criticism. When Jacob expresses concern that the brothers have incurred the en- mity of the surrounding towns (v. 30), they unabashedly ask, "Should our sister be made a whore?" (v. 31). 11 Despite their concern for Dinah's reputation, the bothers do not refer to Dinah by her name - only as "our sister" (v. 31). Nicholas Wyatt suggests that this is because Dinah's feelings are of no concern to her brothers: she is simply an element of property."12 More to the point, by referring to Dinah as "our sister," instead of by her name, the brothers convey that their lethal act of anger is intended, not simply to avenge Dinah, but to broadcast the repercussions of committing an "outrage in Israel" by violating a sister in the family of Jacob.13 Ingo Kottsieper and Ronald Hyman suggest that the brothers' ques- tion, "Should our sister be made a whore?" (v. 31) is a criticism of Jacob's inaction.14 This is unlikely. Nowhere does the passage hint that the brothers condemn Jacob's inaction. However, the passage does con- fer upon Jacob a marginalized role. The elder father is introduced as no longer shepherding in the field at this time (v. 5). By contrast, Simeon 11 For a discussion and bibliography on the nature of Shehem' s offense and its bear- ing on the family of Jacob refer to Lynn Bechtel, "What if Dinah is not Raped?"

Thus, the passage highlights the brothers' vital role within the family. The broth- ers have taken upon themselves the mantle of responsibility, previously held by their aging father, to punish a breach of Jacob's family.16 Through their lethal act they demonstrate that the next generation re- sponds harshly to violations against Jacob's tribe. Lethal Anger at Foreigners In response to the brothers' anger (v. 8), Hamor suggests that the women and men of Israel marry the women and men of Hamor (v. 9). At first glance, Hamor's offer seems aimed at satisfying his son's desire for Dinah. However, were Hamor's concern primarily for his son's hap- piness, he might have requested that Shehem and Dinah alone join in marriage. The incongruence between Shehem's singular desire for Dinah (¡TON1? nNTH rnVīl nK v. 4) and the scope of Hamor's request (ÛDT22 una Tinnnn; v. 9), has led scholars to view Genesis 34 as comprised of two separate sources (a Shehem source and a Hamor source), or reflecting a redactional expansion of an original source.17 For example, Claus Westermann suggests that the account of Hamor's mar- riage negotiations was not originally related to Shehem's desire for Dinah, but "merely the occasion; it is a step from family narrative to political event; it is a matter of increasing the extent and wealth of a city by taking into it a nomadic group with large flocks."18 Westermann may be right that economics is Hamor's main interest in an earlier iteration of the narrative in which Hamor's offer reflects a strategy to absorb a rich nomadic group. However, in its present con- 15 Wenham suggests that this dual reference implies that Jacob's failure to act incites the brothers' extreme response. Gordon Wenham, Genesis 16-50 (Word Biblical Com- mentary; Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1994) 315. 16 Alexander Rofé suggests that in an earlier version the account was a clan saga that extolled the deeds of heroic clan leaders, but in its present form, the text is a polemic against intermarriage with impure gentiles. Alexander Rofé, "Defilement of Virgins in Biblical Law and the Case of Dinah (Gen 34)," Biblica 86 no. 3 (2005) 369-75. 17 The passage may reflect one story that was later reworked, or two accounts that were later combined such as an account of a threatened family member by a foreigner and another about occupying land in Israel. Claus Westermann, Genesis 12-36 : A Con- tinental Commentary. (Trans. John Scullion; Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1985) 536-39. Cf. Rofé, "Defilement of Virgins," 369. 18 Westermann, Genesis 12-36 , 536-39.</page><page sequence="8">346 DEENA GRANT text, as joined with the Shehem account and cited immediately after mention of the brothers' anger, Hamor's marriage offer may be viewed as an attempt to avert the typically lethal nature of anger at outsiders. Genesis 34 uses a variety of techniques to stress that the Shehemites are outsiders. At the outset of the chapter, verse 2 notes Shehem 's foreignness, identifying him as a Hivite (1HXn łCOT "nnn Tl»n~p DDP; v. 2). The passage moves on to describe the Hivites as an uncircumcised people (nVlS?) with whom Israel cannot marry because are not "like" the family of Jacob (vv. 14-15). Against this backdrop, the brothers' massacre of Shehem's town can be viewed as the outcome of anger at foreigners. This inteipretation of the brothers' lethal act may shed light on Hamor's proposition that the women and men of his town marry the women and men of Jacob's clan.19 Hamor reasons, "And we will live among you and become one people" (v. 16). Perhaps, Hamor's proposal is an attempt to attain immunity from otherwise lethal anger at foreign- ers. This is particularly likely given that, as we observe below, anger at family is not lethal. Ironically, however, Hamor's request foreshadows the brothers' massacre. Hamor offers his whole town in marriage - not only Shehem. Dinah's brothers' slaughter all the males of Hamor's town - not only Shehem. Judges 14:1-20 Demonstration of Authority Judges 14 offers another example of lethal anger over illicit relations albeit, in this case, non-sexual (v. 18-20). When Samson discovers that Ashkelonites have conspired with his wife to solve his riddle, he kills the perpetrators' kinsmen and then walks away in anger (VlTl löK im liras rp3; v. 19). The passage does not identify the direct object of Samson's anger. However, by juxtaposing his anger against the Ashke- lonites' offense (v. 19 and vv. 12-18), the passage implies that Samson's anger is directed at the Ashkelonites who engage with his wife. Samson's wife is not violated sexually. Nevertheless, the Ashke- lonites' illicit dealing with her is an infringement upon Samson's family 19 Marriage brings economic and social benefits that are otherwise reserved for blood relations. "The Shehemites are proposing something akin to inter-clan covenant which would create an affinity between the two non-kinship groups." Allen Guenther, "A Typology of Israelite Marriage: Kinship, Socio-Economic and Religious Factors," JSOT 29 no. 4 (2005) 387-407.</page><page sequence="9">HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE 347 authority that is an offense against her family, similar to Shehem's violation of Jacob's family with Dinah. Indeed, the Bible likens both acts to theft. Samson compares the Ashkelonites violation of his spousal bond to theft of property when he contends that the Ashkelonites have "used his calf," (VlVwn ontmn nViV; v. 18). Analogously, Dinah's brothers describe Shehem's offense as an "outrage in Israel," which is the same phrase Joshua 7 employs to describe Ahan's theft of vessels.20 Surprisingly, the passage does not cite Samson's anger before or im- mediately after it depicts him massacring the Ashkelonites. Instead, Samson is described as angry only after he delivers the tunics of the slain kinsmen to his provokers. The disconnect of Samson's anger from his lethal act can be attributed to the function of his bestowal of tunics. Whereas Dinah's brothers broadcast their authority over their family domain by killing their provoker and his town, Samson demonstrates his authority to his provokers by offering them the festal garments of their slain kinsmen (v. 19). Thus, it is through his bestowal - not murder - that Samson publicly demonstrates his authority over his violated do- main. Once he demonstrates his dominance, he turns to retrieve his wife and reestablish his family (15: l).21 Lethal Anger at Foreigners Judges 14 parallels Genesis 34 in its definition of foreigners - being uncircumcised- and its depiction of the consequences of anger at for- eigners - murder of kinsmen. Genesis 34 introduces Shehem as a mem- ber of an uncircumcised group with whom the women of Israel may not marry (Gen 34:14-15). Judges 14 similarly records Samson's parents warning him against marrying into the uncircumcised Philistines (D^nrn üTípVdD; v. 3). When Shehem elicits the brothers' anger, they kill him and his town; when the uncircumcised Philistines elicit Samson's anger, he kills their kinsmen (vv. 18-20). Thus, the angered 20 This analogy is not surprising because illicit relations was perceived as akin to theft of property. William Propp, "Kinship in 2 Samuel 13," CBQ 55 no. 1 (1993) 41. Cf. Bechtel, "What if Dinah is not Raped?," 19-36. 21 While this may explain why Samson's anger is not cited adjacent to the massacre, it is still surprising that Samson is described as angry only after he commits the show of power. Typically, in the Bible, individuals are described as angry before they engage in a punitive act, not after. This may reflect an understanding that reprisal alleviates anger as is stated explicitly in Esther 7:10. The statement that Samson returns home angry, even after he massacres the Ashkelonites, suggests that his reprisal does not alleviate his anger. Perhaps this indicates that not just any lethal act alleviates anger, but only reprisal that results in the death of the provoker.</page><page sequence="10">348 DEENA GRANT parties communicate that uncircumcised foreigners' may not violate the spousal bond of a Hebrew man€22 Daniel 3:1-30 Violated Authority In Daniel 3, Chaldean informants elicit Nebuchadnezzar's anger (îm n»m; v. 13 and Nön v. 19) when they reveal that three Jewish subjects, Shedrach, Meshach and Abed nego, refuse to bow to his newly erected statue (vv. 1, 7-20). The men's defiance poses a direct challenge to Nebuchadnezzar's authority as supreme leader, for, as John Goldin- gay suggests, Nebuchadnezzar erected the statue either as a symbol for his own standing, or to facilitate the worship of his own image.23 The Chaldeans accompany their allegation with two pieces of infor- mation: 1) the rebels are Jews 2) and they were granted political author- ity within Babylon by the king himself (vv. 12-13). By reminding Nebuchadnezzar that he was complicit in setting up the circumstances of his disregarded authority, the Chaldeans elicit a sense of weakness which turns into angry reprisal. Foreign Jews and Lethal Anger The Chaldeans stress that the Jews are the only people the king has not successfully coerced to bow to his statue (vv. 7-12). John Collins suggests that by singling out the rebels as Jews the Chaldeans communi- cate that the men's Jewish identity is the key to their disobedience.24 The informants' claim proves justified, for the three Jews assert that they cannot bow to the king's statue because they worship their deity exclusively (vv. 16-18). Thus, the men reveal that their foreign identity - as defined by their exclusive worship of Yah weh - lay at the root of their insubordination. 22 Even though Samson's wife - a born Philistine - participates in perpetrating the offense against him, Samson does not harm her. In fact, later, in Judges 15, Samson wants to reunite with his wife (Judg 15: 1). He even avenges her murder (Judg 15:7b-8). The spousal bond may explain the extreme difference between Samson's response to his wife's disloyalty and his response to the Philistines' offense. When Samson marries a born Philistine (Judg 14:1-3), he acquires her as his possession (Judg 14:18). We sug- gest below that relatedness protects against the lethal consequences of anger. Perhaps then, the marriage bond mitigates Samson anger at his wife. 23 John Goldingay, Daniel (WBC 30; Dallas: Word Books, 1989) 72-73. 24 John Collins, John Joseph, Frank Moore Cross, and Adela Yarbro, Daniel: A Commentary on the Book of Daniel (Hermeneia; Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1993) 186.</page><page sequence="11">HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE 349 Not only does the Jews' foreign identity bring about their provoca- tion, it also determines the lethal nature of Nebuchadnezzar's anger. The king first gets angry after he hears that the Jews refuse to obey his com- mand to bow (n»m Tna nsnsmi fHNS; V. 13).25 However, this initial anger does not compel him to throw the rebels in the furnace. Instead, Nebuchadnezzar gives the Jews a chance to obey his direct order (v. 10). Perhaps he assumes that he can compel them to obey him, just as he coerced all the other foreign peoples of his lands to accept his authority (vv. 1-8). Nebuchadnezzar's anger turns lethal only after he discovers that he cannot coerce these 'outsiders' to accept his authority. Once the Jews explain that their allegiance to a foreign deity precludes them from re- specting the king's authority - they will not bow to his statue because the will of their 'Jewish' deity supersedes his own - Nebuchadnezzar expresses lethal anger. No longer able to compose his visage, the king's face distorts in anger and he determines to kill the rebels (NDtl v. 19).26 Notably, Nebuchadnezzar accompanies his decision with a question, "Could any god rescue you from the furnace?" (v. 15).27 By challenging the power of the Jews' deity to save his worshippers, Nebuchadnezzar challenges Yahweh's worthiness as their singular au- thority. Disregard for Authority by a Family Member Whereas anger at outsiders is lethal in the Bible, anger at kin is be- nign, regardless of the offense. We suggest that it is an individual's af- fection for his provoker coupled with self- interest to preserve his family line that quashes lethal anger against family. Ironically, self-interest backfires; the absence of a punitive response leads to a greater loss of authority. 25 The term, non, signals a dynamic emotion that can be restrained or subsides through reprisal. The term, TD, is an emotion that typically does not compel punishment. TDOT 13:304. Together, these words may signal Nebuchadnezzar's preparedness to wait for his intense non to dissipate without committing a lethal act. 26 The expression of n»n in the king's face coupled with the omission of TD, reflects Nebuchadnezzar's heightening anger. 27 Notably, when Nebuchadnezzar discovers that Yahweh has protected the Jews from the fiery furnace, he blesses their god on behalf of the three men (3:28) and then praises Yahweh himself (3:32-33). By portraying Nebuchadnezzar praising Yahweh, the passage conveys Nebuchadnezzar's newfound affiliation with the Jews. This affiliation may be what contributes his dissipating anger in the face of a failed reprisal.</page><page sequence="12">350 DEENA GRANT Genesis 27:1-46 Loosing Authority In Genesis 27, Jacob incites Esau's anger ("[TIN nan) when he steals Esau's blessing (vv. 41-45). Jacob's theft is set within the context of a fraternal rivalry for authority. This theme first becomes apparent when the brothers are introduced as mere fetuses already struggling for domi- nance in the womb. "And the Lord said to her, 'Two nations in the womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger" (Gen 25:23).28 The struggle for dominance continues when the brothers are grown and Jacob tricks Esau into giving him the blessing of the first-born. The blessing couples fertile land with dominion over brothers, "May God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine. Let people's serve you, and nations bow down to you. Be Lord over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. Cursed be everyone who curses you, and blessed be every- one who blesses you" (vv. 28-29). By coupling fertile land with domin- ion over brothers, the blessing implies that its recipient attains economic success through fertility, and that this success sets him 'in charge' of his brothers ("pnx1? T3S; v. 29).'29 When Esau discovers the theft he cries out (vv. 33-37). Esau has be- come angry ("[TIN nan; v. 44). The passage indicates that Esau' anger derives, particularly, from his loss of authority, by stating the loss three times. Isaac blesses Jacob with dominion over brothers, "Be lord over your brothers ("pníò T3S), and may your mother's sons bow down to you. "(v. 29). Isaac then recalls his bestowal of dominion upon Jacob, "I have already made him your lord (ļV TTiölP T31), and I have given him all his brothers as servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What can I do for you, my son?'" (v. 37). Finally, Isaac offers Esau a new blessing that affirms Jacob's future, albeit temporary, do- minion over him, "By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother ("ns?n "pnx nKI) but when you break loose, you shall break his yoke from your neck" (v. 40).30 28 Westermann suggest that the account of Jacob's theft in Genesis 27 was originally an independent family narrative that has been set in a broader context and adapted along the lines of a rivalry motif.

Before Jacob meets Esau, he sends Esau a conciliatory message. In his message, Jacob refers to Esau as his master (WV TTIÒ; 32:4) and himself as Esau's servant (3pST 32:4). When they see each other, Esau hugs and kisses Jacob and Jacob bows before Esau seven times (33:3). By portraying Jacob bowing to Esau his "lord," the Bible paints a portrait of a man attempting to assuage his superior's anger.31 Softening Anger versus Lethal Hate Chapter 27 highlights the softening nature of brotherly anger by jux- taposing it against the persistent and lethal nature of fraternal hate.32 "pn1? ļV aniña ... vin apsr-nx nnnto &lt;- ws oaon (41-42) nx nsen -pa -pnu aw-ns &lt;- -pnx nan awn-wx i» (43-45) When Esau hears that Jacob stole his blessing, he experiences hatred (Otjun) and wants to kill Jacob (vv. 41-42). The root DO® means, "to bear animosity against." Typically, it connotes animosity that persists,33 and it always heralds punishment, usually of the violent sort.34 In this context, D DV implies that Esau plans to bear his violent hatred until the end of the mourning period when he will kill Jacob. By contrast to Esau's lethal hate, Esau's anger is introduced as a tem- porary passion that subsides. Rebecca instructs Jacob to run away for just a few days until Esau's anger "turns" ("pnx nan awn - IS?; v. 44). She reiterates this point, adding that, when Esau's anger turns, he will forget the offense (i1? m?» -iwx-nx nam -jaa "pnn-*ļN ainï: v. 45). "35 a father passes on his own vitality to his son and therefore, "nothing more can be done with a blessing already dispensed." The fact that Isaac does bless Esau at all may reflect a later narrator's attempt to conform the nature of ancient blessings to a later period. Westermann, Genesis 12-36 , 435-44. 31 He further notes that court rituals in the Amarna letters often include the formula, "I fall prostrate at the feet of my Lord, seven and seven times." Westermann points out that Jacob's conciliatory greeting resembles an interaction "as could take place between an overlord and his rebellious or otherwise culpable vassal." Westermann, Genesis 12- 36, 524-25. 32 Wenham, Genesis 16-50, 212. 33 BDB, 966. 34 See Gen 27:41, 49:23, 50:15, Job 16:9, 30:21 and Ps 55:4. 35 When the subject of 3HP is anger, the verb typically describes someone who turns away from carrying out destructive acts precipitated by anger, "nw," TDOT 14:474-78.</page><page sequence="14">352 DEENA GRANT As Rebecca predicts (though not within the time frame she predicts) Esau's anger at his brother softens and he is no longer consumed by le- thal hatred. We know this because, years later, when Esau and Jacob reunite, Esau hugs and kisses Jacob (33 :4).36 He even invites Jacob to journey with him to Seir (33: 12). Lost Authority Though Jacob goes through the motions of respecting his elder brother, Esau never reclaims the blessing that was rightfully his. Esau's anger over the stolen blessing foreshadows Jacob's eventual independ- ence and success. The younger brother successfully establishes himself as economically independent of his elder brother's dominance.37 1 Samuel 20:1-42 Non-lethal Anger at a Son King Saul becomes angry when his son supports David, a perceived pretender to Saul's throne (jrmrrn VlNtP v. 30). In contrast to most other biblical examples of treachery in which the traitor is ex- ecuted, Saul does not kill Jonathan.38 Instead, Saul demands that Jonathan reaffirm his loyalty and annul the threat to Saul's rule by de- livering David into his hands (vv. 30-33). When Jonathan protests, Saul throws a spear in his direction (iron1? vVtt mnílTiK VlNtP Vtri; v. 33). David Tsumura and Ralph Klein interpret Saul's throw as an attempt to kill Jonathan.39 Though their translation is in line with the Septuagint and Dead Sea Scrolls, it is unlikely. More likely, Saul throws his spear as a benign sign of frustration, rather than an attempt to kill his son. The infinitive construct verb form iriDH1? - the term used to describe Saul's assault on Jonathan - does not necessarily signify a lethal strike.40 On the contrary, Saul's spear appears to miss Jonathan, even though they are close enough to be in the midst of a conversation. Moreover, after Saul throws the spear, Jonathan realizes that Saul is determined to kill 36 For example, Laban to his daughters (32: 1) and Joseph to his brothers (45:5). 37 Gen 31. 38 As is seen by Moses and Korach (Num 16), Haman and Mordecai (Esth 3), Saul and David (1 Sam 18) and Nebuchadnezzar and the three Jews (Dan 3). 39 Tsumura translates verse 33, "and then Saul tries to kill Jonathan." Tsumura, The First Book of Samuel, 521.

See Deut 25:3, 1 Kgs 20:35.</page><page sequence="15">HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE 353 David , not that Saul intends to kill him (v. 33). This explains why Jonathan reacts to Saul's throw by leaving angry and humiliated - not running away in fear because his father has tried to kill him (v. 34).41 It also explains why, when Jonathan leaves Saul's presence, Saul makes no move to pursue him. Saul does not respond with lethal anger because if he were to kill his son and heir, he would compromise the perpetuation of his own dynasty. He indicates as much when he reprimands Jonathan saying, that as long as the son of Jesse lives, Jonathan's kingship will not be established (v. 31). After warning Jonathan against compromising the perpetuation of his royal line, Saul would not try to compromise it himself by killing his own son.42 As set within the books of 1 and 2 Samuel, Saul's relatively benign anger at Jonathan can be attributed to his paternal affection for his son, as well. In David's song of eulogy over Saul and Jonathan, David de- clares that the father and son loved each other in life and remain bonded in death, "Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely. In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions" (2 Sam 1 :23). Even if this poem was unknown to the author of 1 Samuel 20, the song brings to the fore a theme of paternal attach- ment that may have influenced the description of Saul's benign anger in 1 Samuel 20. Loss of Authority Saul fails to uphold his authority with his non-lethal anger for, Jonathan disregards Saul's anger and proceeds to help David (vv. 35- 42). Yahweh has already ordained the end of Saul's dynasty. The king's impotent response to his son's provocation signals that the edict is com- ing closer to fruition. 2 Samuel 13:1-39 Anger versus Hate Amnon provokes his father's anger (*TKD iV "im) when he rapes his own sister, Tamar (vv. 14-21). Despite his anger, David does not punish 41 We noted, in the Introduction, that this is one of the few examples of the anger of a subordinate over the actions of his authority. Nevertheless, we point out that the text carefully describes Jonathan as angry at the situation, not at Saul. 42 McCarter attempts to resolve this difficulty by revocalizing the MT of tikkon as takin , "you and your kingship will not be secure." See P. Kyle McCarter, II Samuel (New York: Doubleday, 1984) 339.</page><page sequence="16">354 DEENA GRANT his son. Kottsieper suggests that David's failure to punish Amnon reflects David's distance from his daughter, Tamar.43 TTiis is unlikely. The passage appears wholly uninterested in exploring David's relation- ship with his daughter. Instead, Tamar' s rape functions, primarily, as the setting upon which the narrator depicts the fatal interaction between two brothers. The passage records Tamar leaving the scene immediately after her rape (vv. 19-20), and quickly passes over her father's anger (v. 21) in order to record the intrigue that leads to Absalom's murder (v. 22). Nevertheless, this passing reference to David's response reveals much about the nature of familial anger. Recalling how Genesis 27 jux- taposes Esau's anger against his hate, 2 Samuel 13 juxtaposes David's anger against Amnon's hate. In both Genesis 27 and 2 Samuel 13, the juxtaposition highlights the difference between anger and hate.44 When Amnon rapes Dinah, David gets angry and does nothing (7XQ V? "im; 13:21) while Absalom feels hate, refuses to speak to Amnon (*137~nVi pias-nx di^bdk xier-o aw-nsn sia1? ņiairos ūVjbon; 13:22) and later kills him (w. 26-29). Toward the end of the chapter, Absalom murders Amnon (vv. 26-29) and David weeps over Amnon's death (v. 36). By juxtaposing the two emotions at the beginning of the chapter, and the outcomes of the emotions again at the end of the chapter, the passage conveys that fraternal hate compels murder, and paternal anger triggers no punitive response.45 Though the passage does not disclose why David refrains from pun- ishing Amnon, it does reveal that David's bond with Amnon remains in- tact in spite of his anger at his son. By describing David weeping for Amnon in the same chapter that it describes David as angry at Amnon (vv. 36b, 39) the passage intimates that David does not act in anger be- cause of his feelings for his son. This explanation of David's inaction is supported by the Septuagint and 4QSama that offer an expanded version of verse 21. Both ancient texts append a phrase that explains David's failure to reprimand Amnon, "Because he loved him because he was his firstborn" (p]TD3 "O 13[nK]; 4QSama and LXX). According to P. Kyle McCarter, the absence of this 43 Kottsieper, "We Have A Little Sister," 61. 44 The only other passage that links anger and hate, Genesis 27, also highlights the differences between the two emotions. We will address this below. 45 The difference in outcomes cannot be attributed solely to a difference between paternal and fraternal anger because fraternal anger usually follows the paradigm of family anger that subsides (cf. Gen 27:44-45 and 1 Sam 17:28).</page><page sequence="17">HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE 355 phrase in the MT is due to haplography.46 If this is so, than an earlier iteration of 2 Sam 13 explicitly expressed the notion that family ties mitigate the consequences of anger. Even if McCarter is mistaken, and the Septuagint and Qumran versions expand upon the MT original, the texts reveal that an early biblical interpreter believed that familial love restrains anger. 47 Familial Anger and Loss of Authority Absalom's assault against Amnon is similar to Dinah's brothers' at- tack against Shehem. Tamar describes Amnon's act as an "outrage that should not be committed in Israel," the same phrase the brothers use to describe Shehem's violation of Dinah (ntrarr1?# Vinton p nwsr-N1? nKTn nVnan-nK; 2 Sam 13:12; npsr-rn-rìK iswh zrn ntra nVni-'o TOST nV pi; Gen 34:7). In both cases, the "outrage" provokes anger and murder and, in both cases, brothers act, in place of their fathers, to punish violations against their families. However, these otherwise analogous passages diverge to conform to our observed paradigms of anger. Whereas anger precipitates murder against a foreigner in Genesis 34, it is benign against kin in 2 Samuel 13. These differing consequences lead to divergent outcomes. Dinah's brothers' lethal anger aims to prevent future violations against Jacob's family ("Should our sister be treated like a whore"; Gen 34:31). By contrast, David's inaction gives Absalom an opportunity to violate David's familial authority even further by murdering David's son (2 Sam 13:26-29). David is caught in a Catch-22. Were he to kill his offender, who is also a healthy heir to the Davidic throne, he could compromise the sur- vival of his own dynasty. However, by neglecting to punish the of- fender, David supplies the opportunity for his own son to contravene his benign verdict and punish the violation against his family. Thus, by doing nothing, David compromises his dynasty anyway. Yahweh has al- ready ordained that David's royal line will continue to fall by the sword (2 Sam 12: 10).48 The king's impotent anger is a step toward the fulfillment of this divine edict. 46 McCarter, II Samuel , 319-20. 47 Notably LXX adds that David's anger subsides over Absalom's murder of Amnon. This is another illustration of dissipating anger at a kin (2 Sam 13:29). 48 "...your (David's) household will never be free of the sword" (2 Sam 12:10).</page><page sequence="18">356 DEENA GRANT Exceptions There are two exceptions to our paradigms of lethal anger at foreign- ers and non-lethal anger at kin. We suggest that in both of these cases (Gen 39, Gen 4), the divergences occur because Yahweh involves Him- self in the relationship between men. Genesis 39:1-20 Disregarded Authority by a Servant Genesis 39 offers a unique example of non-lethal anger at a foreigner in its depiction of Potiphar's anger at Joseph. Potiphar becomes angry when he hears that Joseph advanced sexually upon his wife (1DK v. 19). Joseph's alleged offense is a severe form of disregarded domestic authority, for Potiphar perceives himself to have been violated, not by an equal, but by his mere servant (vv. 14-19). The significance of disre- garded hierarchy in this setting of compromised authority is conveyed by both the language and structure of the passage. The passage calls attention to the significance of disregarded author- ity in eliciting Potiphar's anger by recounting Potiphar relinquishing control over his entire estate to Joseph (vv. 4-6) immediately before it depicts Joseph provoking him (vv. 7-19). "So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him (WN m EH) he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all he had. From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all he had... So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge; and, with him there, he had no concern for anything but the food that he ate" (v. 4-6a). Gordon Wenham notes that the passage employs the root mtP to de- scribe Joseph's service to Potiphar (v. 4). He suggests that the use of the term mttf highlights "Joseph's rise in Potiphar's esteem."49 Whereas the more common root 12V can indicate menial jobs done by slaves, the root mtf "always implies personal service." Indeed, Potiphar set Joseph in charge of his entire household. The significance of Joseph's status as a mere servant is underscored by the accusation Potiphar's wife raises against him. When Potiphar's wife accuses Joseph before the men of the household, she describes Joseph as a foreign man (nns; ttPN; v. 14), but when she accuses him before Potiphar, she refers to Joseph as a foreign slave , "The Hebrew 49 Wenham, Genesis 16-50 , 376.</page><page sequence="19">HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE 357 servant whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me" v. 17). Thus, it appears that Potiphar's wife "adjusted (her story) to make the maximum impact on him (Potiphar)"50 Moreo- ver, similar to the Chaldeans' accusation before Nebuchadnezzar that the rebels are Jews who the king, himself, placed in power (Dan 3:12), Potiphar's wife reminds her husband that his authority has been disre- garded by the very man he placed in his service. Both accusations elicit anger and reprisal.51 Potiphar banishes Joseph to the king's prison, "When his master heard the words that his wife spoke to him, saying, 'This is the way your servant treated me,' he became enraged (1ĎK nm). And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined; he remained there in prison" (vv. 19-20). Notably, the verses refer to Potiphar and Joseph, not by their names, but as "his master" (TTTK) and "your servant" (*p3S7). We suggest that this language is meant to emphasize the purpose of Potiphar's act of anger - to reassert his authority. Indeed, Joseph's 'master' publicizes his high stature as a steward of the king by sending Joseph to the king* s prison. By this, Potiphar demonstrates that violations against his family are punished in the same manner as are violations against Pharaoh. Anger and Foreignness Potiphar's wife arouses his anger by reminding him that Joseph is his Hebrew servant, "The Hebrew servant (na^n *T3S7n), whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me" (39: 17). In view of the passages above, in which anger at foreigners proves lethal, the mention of Joseph's foreign lineage may be intended to evoke lethal anger. How- ever, in contrast to our prior examples of lethal anger at foreigners, Potiphar's anger is not lethal. Potiphar condemns Joseph to the king's prison - he does not execute him (vv. 19b-20). Wenham remarks that Joseph's punishment "is a somewhat unex- pected punishment" because in Deuteronomy (22:33-27) "convicted rapists were executed when both parties were free citizens."52 Wenham reconciles these differing judgments by suggesting that Joseph's protes- tations of innocence convinced Potiphar that his wife might be fabricat- 50 Ibid. 51 We mentioned above that modern psychology understands anger to be caused by a loss of self esteem and a feeling of weakness that leads an individual engage in acts of reprisal aimed at restoring dominance. See above. 52 Wenham, Genesis 16-50, 377.</page><page sequence="20">358 DEENA GRANT ing the story. However, Wenham also concedes that nowhere else does the text hint that Potiphar doubts his wife.53 While our passage does not imply that Potiphar doubts his wife, it does record Potiphar' s prior affection for Joseph, "So Joseph found favor in his sight (WN mtn vr»3 |n *10V KSa-n) and attended him. He made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had" (v. 4). The text's reference to Potiphar "favoring" Joseph may be intended to convey his ambivalence. Should Potiphar respond with lethal anger toward an individual whom he once favored? Such ambivalence would not be surprising since, as we saw previ- ously, affection mitigates anger. However, we observed also in our pre- vious examples that familial affection mitigates anger. While Joseph is part of Potiphar' s household, he is not kin. Perhaps then, it is Potiphar' s ample affection for this non-kin that accounts for this unusual outcome of anger. By banishing Joseph to the king's prison, a place where prisoners are periodically, but not always, executed, Potiphar, in effect, decides not to decide (40:5, 22). Divine Involvement In any case, Genesis 39 does not conform to a typical paradigm of biblical human anger because it reflects an atypical instance of anger within the context of divine intervention. Yahweh bestows upon Joseph the success that curries Potiphar's favor, "The Lord was with Joseph, and he became a successful man; he was in the house of his Egyptian master. His master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hands. So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him. He made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had" (w. 2-4). The deity brings about Potiphar's affection and, by this, mitigates Potiphar's, perhaps other- wise, lethal anger. Genesis 4:3-11 The Cain and Abel story offers an exception to the typical pattern of non-lethal family anger for it is the only example in the Hebrew Bible where anger compels an individual to kill his immediate kin mn m rnx Van-Vx p¡? o¡m ...ras "fren tnö ļ-p1? (nm; w. 5-8). The passage highlights the exceptional nature of Cain's anger by reiter- 53 Ibid.</page><page sequence="21">HUMAN ANGER IN BIBLICAL LITERATURE 359 ating again and again that Cain's victim is his own brother (vv. 8, 9, 10, 11). Scholars endeavor to explicate this passage by speculating about why Yahweh prefers Abel's offering over Cain's.54 Some suggest that the awkward transition between Yahweh 's preference for Abel's sacrifice (vv. 4-6) and Cain's murder of Abel (v. 8) hints to an earlier version of the account in which a different event precipitates Cain's murder.55 Re- gardless, Westermann rightly points out that the passage is simply not interested in explaining why Yahweh prefers Abel's sacrifice. Instead, in its present form, the text focuses on Cain's response to Yahweh's rejec- tion - not Yahweh's intent toward the brothers.56 Mayer Gruber explores the nature of Cain's anger in his article, "The Tragedy of Cain and Abel: A Case of Depression."57 Gruber argues that the Cain and Abel story "cannot be construed as an account of the dangerous effects of ordinary anger." He draws attention to the fact that the passage appends the preposition V- to the subject of the verb mn (1 KD ppV 1WV, v. 5 and Hin; v. 6), rather than employing the more common phrase, by which the verb mn modifies Whereas the latter phrase literally means "the nose burns" and consistently denotes anger, im ppV literally means "it burns Cain" and can denote sadness or depression. As evidence, Gruber points out that Cain's anger is re- flected in a fallen face (V2Ď yph *im; v. 5), and that the phrase "his face fell" was widely regarded in the ancient Near East as a symp- tom of sadness.58 Gruber notes, as well, that Genesis 34 also associates the phrase mn with sadness (TNô Ù7Ò "in^ DTOKíl maSHm; 34 :7).59 Thus, he concludes: 54 Most suggestions focus on the quality of Cain's sacrifice versus the quality of Abel's sacrifice. Cf. Judah Goldin, "The youngest son or where does Genesis 38 be- long?"

John Scullion; Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, 1984) 294. 56 Westermann argues that the passage aims to convey that Yahweh's will is abso- lute and that human "envy" is the most powerful trigger of conflict in the history of humanity. Westermann is right to observe that the passage focuses more on Cain than on Yahweh. However, by characterizing Cain as "envious" rather than "angry," Wester- mann obscures the role of human anger in the passage.

Genesis 34 describes the brothers as both angry and sad (TNö DH1? "im D'WNn instivi; v. 7), and, analogously, Genesis 4 describes Cain as angry and having a fallen face (ppV *im V2D iVön v. 5). While anger is not embodied in a fallen face else- where in the Bible, sadness is.62 Thus we conclude that 'h nin encom- passes sadness only when it is accompanied by a description of sadness. Psycho-analytic theory defines the persistent sadness that is depres- sion as anger turned inward upon the self.63 Such anger leads to feelings of alienation and detachment.64 Westermann and Karel Deurloo suggest that Cain's depression is experienced as an alienation from community ties. 65 We argue that it is precisely this alienation from his family com- munity - from Abel - that allows Cain's anger to be lethal. Indeed, Cain's detachment is strikingly apparent when he protests the role that should be natural, "Am I my brother's keeper?" Divine Involvement The exceptional nature of Cain's lethal anger at Abel can be ex- plained by Yahweh's involvement in the narrative. Typically, affection and self interest mitigate anger at family. However, in this instance, Cain's detachment from his immediate human kin may reflect a self interested desire to be affiliated with his more powerful relation, his father's father, his creator, Yah weh. 60 Gruber, "The Tragedy of Cain and Abel," 94. 61 Another example of anger coupled with sadness may be found in Jonah 4:9. Like some depressives, Jonah's internal experience compels him toward suicide. 62 See Job 29:24 (Jeremiah 3:12 may be an exception). 03 Gruber, "The Tragedy of Cam," 92. 64 Peter Kramer, Against Depression (New York: Penguin Books, 2006). 55 As in Num 6:26.

Through a survey of passages in which anger language is present we have con- cluded that human anger is intimately tied up with issues of authority. Anger is a response to disregarded authority whose expression is aimed at reasserting compromised or threatened authority. We have observed also that the outcomes of human anger depend, primarily, on the rela- tionship between the angered party and his provoker. This correlation may reflect a broader link between emotion and self preservation. Anger compels an individual to murder an outsider who threatens the stability of the collective upon which he depends, but it does not compel him to murder his kin upon whom he may depend. It is therefore ironic that benign anger at kin foreshadows a negative outcome for the angered party. Since anthropomorphic descriptions of Yah weh are undoubtedly in- formed by the Bible's more concrete notions of human experiences, surely our insights into human anger offer an illuminating backdrop against which scholars might examine biblical impressions of divine an- ger. Future directions of study could involve exploring how closely bib- lical depictions of divine anger approach biblical descriptions of human anger and, conversely, to what extent the portrait of Yahweh's anger diverges from biblical depictions of human anger.</page></plain_text>
