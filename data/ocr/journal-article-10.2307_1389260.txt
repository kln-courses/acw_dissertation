STEDMAN JONES* Goldsmiths' College ABSTRACT: This article concerns the relation buweenDurkheim's "rues" for sociological method and Charles Renouvir's Logique. It identifies each chapter of Durkheim's book as relying in a specific way on features of Renouvier's logical and scientific system Certain of the puzzles of Durkheim's thought can be elucidate, if not fully explicated, by an analysis of Renourier's Logique. The Rules is a severe book, written in a didactic, prescriptive manner. Its aim is nothing less than to establish the method for objective knowledge of social phenomena. It echoes both Descartes and Bacon in its attempt to establish universal rules both for the direction of the understanding and criteria for knowledge of phenomena. That Durkheim can, at various times in his thought, call on both Descartes and Bacon is evidence of a more profound influence than either of these separately-that of the "great master" who was "his educator," Charles Renouvier. At each stage of Les Regles de La M&amp;thode Sociologique (hereafter, The Rules), Durkheim shows his intellectual debt to the logic, methodology, and epistemology that Renouvier established in his 'Trait6 de Logique Gen6r6ale et Formelle" (1878) (hereafter, his Logique.) This is the second edition of his Essais de Critique Generale: Premier Essai 1854, which was continued but reformulated and augmented in the second edition. In what follows, I use both editions in my references. (I quote from the Presse Universitaire de France 1987 edition of The Rules and provide my own translations.) Renouvier's Logique is a statement in epistemological terms of the scientific republicanism for which he was so well known and influential during the early years of the Third Republic. The Rules, together with The Division of Labour in Society, was written at Bordeaux, where Durkheim lived for 15 years, from 1887-1902. A member of the Catholic opposition to republicanism, Georges Fonesgrive, was * Direct all correspondence to: S.G.

In "Le Kantisme et La Pens6e Contemporaine," he wrote that "all was impregnated with Kantianism" and that "Renouvier's Citique Philosophique was the philosophical catechism of the young" (1904:3). The Cntue Philosophique was Renouvier's journal established to aid republicanism; it followed and developed the principles of his Logique. This complaint of Fonesgrive tells us two things: first, that in using Renouvier's Logique, Durkheim was drawing on a discourse that was well known, particularly in Bordeaux. Second, it tells us that Durkheim's audience was principally the young. This in itself would have cheered Renouvier, who argued that the task of republicanism was to create new agencies for the republican spirit. Renouvier had a wider audience, however. The critic Thibaudet, writing in 1930, said that Renouvier was the most important philosopher of his epoch, who formed a regiment of Dreyfusian republicains around him (Thibaudet, 1930). Durkheim could thus also be seen to be addressing a republican intellectual elite. The Minister of Education, Louis Liard, was also a follower of Renouvier. Renouvier's Logique established the terms of an approach to reality that is methodologically consistent. Politically, it opposed itself to philosophies which accommodated unacceptable political regimes. Particularly, it opposed itself to Victor Cousin's liberal Eclecticism, which had been the dominant philosophical system in the schools and universities until the fall of Napoleon HI and the collapse of his regime with the Franco-Prussian war. Eclecticism was morally, politically, and methodologically unacceptable to Renouvier, as to other republicans. The stress on an uncompromising method was not value-neutral but inspired by republican principles. Durkheim drew on this method to establish the knowledge of the social and the means by which it can be approached. This method is not something that can be used selectively; to do so would be to return to eclecticism and its lack of principles. Renouvier established a consistent language, which is nothing less than a new grammar for scientific and political discourse. In turn, he argued that this could only be a result of a critique of knowledge: "A general critique must command the elements of a grammar and a universal dictionary to replace the worn and threadbare books of previous centures" (Renouvier 1854:vi). The point of a critique is method: "The result of critique is to formulate a method which is almost enough for science" (1854:vi). The point of this method is "to emancipate the reason of the people," particularly through a critique of authority" (1854:vii). This conception of a critique of knowledge is inspired by Kant: "I thus state clearly that I am continuing Kant ... and (my) ambition is to undertake the serious pursuit of critique in France, which is so lacking in Germany" (1854:x). This established a critical method, which he believed was Kantian in inspiration: it was founded on Kant's "critical intention." This is what inspired the nature and character of Renouvier's scientific enterprise and allowed him to distance himself from positivism. The character of philosophy "has nothing of that ancient metaphysics whose followers penetrated substance, measured the infinite, and constructed the absolute" (1854, I:vi). He particularly attacked the doctrine of substance, as a characteristic of the</page><page sequence="3">Charles Renouvier and Emile Durkheim: Les R6gles de la M6thode Sociologique 29 old metaphysics. We find Durkheim echoing this in his later work "Individual and Collective Representations," writing: "Science does not know substance or pure forms" (1974:23, my translation). This conception of a critical intention establishes what can be known first by establishing what cannot be known. What can be known are phenomena and their relations to "Laws," as Renouvier calls them. An important section of his Logique is dedicated to demonstrating the fallacies in believing that claims to knowledge can move beyond phenomenal relations. This epistemological restriction to phenomenal relations is, I suggest, the leitmotif of The Rules; it is the standpoint by which Durkheim can distance himself from "the positivist metaphysics of Comte and Spencer" (Durkheim 1987:ix), and it allows him to cut a narrow path between subjectivism and objectivism, between realism and nominalism, and to focus on the middle-ground of social facts, collective representations, and the conscience collective as the unique datum of a social science. SOCIAL FACTS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND THE PROBLEM OF EMPIRICISM In chapter one, Durkheim talks of a special order of facts which "consist in representations and actions" (1987:5), or which consist in "manners of action, thought and feeling" (1987:4). A central question for the viability of Durkheim's method is how he thinks that there is such a unique form of data, and why he thinks that they are phenomenally available. I suggest it is a minimum condition of human science that these be available phenomenally, and that in some sense they are available to a method of observation. It is not Bacon, Comte, Spencer, Descartes, or Kant who established this for Durkheim. It was Renouvier, who claimed to be the first in 19th-century philosophy to extend the word phenomena from its restriction to sense-objects to cover ideas, feelings, and "other modes of representation as given" (1878:371). The claim there is a special order of "representations," differentiated Durkheim from empiricism. Durkheim has been frequently accused of empiricism-for example, by Giddens (1977:292) and Benton (1977:89). These accusations appear to overlook Durkheim's own rejection of empiricism in The Rules, which he classes with mysticism "as the negation of science" (1987:33). How can Durkheim argue "that social life is entirely made of representations" (1987:x), criticize philosophical empiricism, and yet claim that sociology is a factual science? The answer to this has to do with the character of representation vis-a-vis the sensory basis of representation, and further with what he regards as the appropriate method for approaching the study of representation. In both cases, Renouvier's thought can elucidate this. First, Renouvier agrees with Kant's critique of philosophical empiricism as leading to a form of irrationalism, indeed nihilism. Its reductionism leads to a dead end, particularly in terms of knowledge and morality. He thus formulates an anti-reductionist concept, which he calls "irreducibility," and applies this to representation. He argues that representation is irreducible to its sensory</page><page sequence="4">30 SOCOLOGICAL PERSPECHVES Volume 38, Number 1, 1995 base, even though sensibility is a crucial aspect of knowledge. Whether in fact Renouvier's concept of irreducibility can bear the heavy epistemological weight which it must cannot be pursued here. Nor can the full implications of the position which follows. Renouvier also taught Durkheim that the appropriate method for the study of representation is that of observation, the method of the natural sciences. Durkheim affirms this in "Individual and Collective Representations": "Observation reveals an order of phenomena called representations" (1974:16). These reflections are fundamental to the possibility of the observation of social facts. Renouvier shows that representations appear, are phenomenal, and are grasped by observation. He dbes this in the first chapter of his Logique. It is for him the very beginning of knowledge. There are two other features of chapter one that show the influence of Renouvier. First is the contentious issue that social facts "present this remarkable property of existing outside of individual consciences" (1987:4). I suggest that we can explain this to some extent through the nature of Renouvier's doctrine of representation. (I will return to the concept of "outside" below.) There is a public, shared quality to his account of representation. "I establish representations, nothing but representations. I do not place them in the I (le moi), for that would be to establish something other than representation" (1854:10). We only know of the self through representation: the self does not constitute a prior epistemological base. In this way, he distances his doctrine from subjective idealism. Social facts exist in this general sphere of representation and, thus, can logically be said to exist in some sense independently of each individual mind. The second feature which indicates the influence of Renouvier is the conception of constraint as defining the presence of the sociaL This power of coercion reveals itself in sanctions. Both the conception of constraint and that of sanction are central to Renouvier's analysis in his La Scence de la Morale (1869). It does not follow that Durkheim uses these concepts in the way that Renouvier does. Renouvier does not talk of "kepouvoircercie of collective representations. Indeed, it may be that Renouvier's intellectual authority for Durkheim may have blinded the latter to the real difficulty of defining the social in terms of constraint. Renouvier does, however, distinguish between good and bad constraint; only the constraint of voluntary agreements is socially acceptable for him. We can see some remains of this in Durkheim's argument that all constraint is not "normal" (1987:6). SOCIAL FACTS AND THINGS- THE QUESTION OF POSITIVISM Durkheim has almost universally been seen as a positivist. This accusation began with Parsons' characterization of The Rules as an example of radical sociological positivism. Recently, this has been continued by Walsh (in Filmer et al. 1972:37). In Britain, students are taught this through Haralambos's textbook which accepts this characterization of Durkheim's position (1980:495). But the characterization appears to overlook, or at the very least to be unable to explain, the fact that Durkheim argues that his project must not be confounded with "the positivist</page><page sequence="5">Charles Rmouvier and Anile Durkheim Les R&amp;ges de la M6thode Sociologique 31 metaphysics of Comte and Spencer" (1987ix). Further, he systematically criticizes Comte throughout The Ruks. The concept of "thing," which he introduces in chapter two, appears to be at the root of these accusations, suggesting that Durkheim wished to found a science of human beings on a science of nature. For Walsh, there is a central vacillation between the postulate that the inner structures of society are forms of consciousness, and treating these as though they are disembodied things. The analysis which foliows will help to rebut this charge. In interpretating Durkheirr, what must be explained is how Durkheim can insist that social facts are "entirely representations" but also must be treated as things. Further, how can their nature be entirely immaterial ("their extreme immateriality," 1987:90), indeed be an elaboration of "faits psychiques" 1987:110), and also be things. Further, how and why does Durkheim use the concept of thing to mean datum, or that which is unmodifiable by the intelligence. It is dear that this cannot be an ontological statement about the nature of social reality, which for him are made up of "manirs de d'~t' which are themselves "maniAres de faire consolidgs" (1987:13). Moreover, Durkheim distances himself from "ontologism" in the Preface to the second edition. Thus, the directive to treat social facts as things, if it is not based on an ontological claim-that is, a daim about the true character of social facts- must be epistemlogical or methodological in character. The phrase does appear after all in chapter two, which concerns rules for the observation of social facts, rather than chapter one, which concerns the definition of a social fact. Further, it differentiates the real from ideologies and the "vulgar" definitions of common sense. The first part of Renouvier's Logque concerns "representation in generaL" He starts with an analysis of the nature of thought: there are two movements of thought: analysis and synthesis. The objects of these two aspects of thought are various sensations, volitions, bodies, minerals, people. All are things, says Renouvier, insofar as they are thought about. The word, he says, has a "sovereign utility" because it does not belong to any system of philosophy. All things have a common characteristic of appearing-of being represented. The concept of thing is tied to his definition of representation. "Representation is that which relates to things, which are distinguished and constructed ("compost") in different ways, and it is that through which we consider them" (1854:6). He distinguishes this philosophical sense of thing from the ordinary use of the word (the worst "thing" the government has done, the most beautiful "thing" or iron is a useful "thing" to people); to use it in this way is "to create idols." The philosophical sense of thing indicates syntheses more or less complex-of representations which are given in experience. This means that, for example, a table as an object of thought is a representation which brings together squareness, brownness, and hardness. A social fact as a thing is thus a synthesis of action, feeling, and thought. Insofar as they are syntheses of representations, they thus constitute things in this philosophical sense. Renouvier insists that this definition is independent of any "definition of school." In particular, it is independent of materialism, which for him is the assumption of positivism. In The Eementary Forms, Durkheim argues that societies "are vast syntheses of complete consciences" (1985:637). This is eminently</page><page sequence="6">32 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECrIVES Volume 38, Number 1, 1995 a thing according to this definition. It is, thus, quite independent of any assumptions about materialism or objectivism, if these positions are understood as holding that only physical objects are objectively real and thereby that persons and their thoughts are in contrast subjective, and therefore in some sense less real than physical objects. It is neutral in relation to the status of the object of reference. The question can still be asked, however, whether persons and their actions do not constitute a unique form of data, which makes it difficult to align them with other aspects of reality. Lukes has dismissed The Rules for its neglect of the micro and hermeneutic level of analysis (1987:14). Durkheim defended himself against the charge of having neglected the mental in sociology by arguing that "he had repeated constantly and in every possible way that social life is made entirely out of representations" (1987:xi). The mental indicates "representation" for Durkheim. Therefore, all questions of meaning and interpretation must be accounted for in terms of representation. EXTERIORITY The next puzzle of chapter two is how Durkheim can claim that social phenomena can be detached from "sujets conscients," who represent them. How can they be modes of seeing or "pratiques constitu&amp;Is" and be so considered? How, if they do this, can social facts be detached from subjects? This is a puzzle that is present from chapter one, where Durkheim introduces the concept of outside ("au dehors de') individual conscience, and throughout the book. This poses a great problem for the understanding of Durkheim's methodology: how, if social life consists in representations and he has repudiated ontologism and materialism, can they have an exteriority? We must note that Durkheim talks of introducing into sociology the revolution that was effected in psychology "thirty years ago" (1987:29). The first edition of Renouvier's Traite de Psychologie Rationelle was published as the "Deuxi6me Essaie de Critique Generale" in 1859. Renouvier, in his Logique, called the analysis of representation "psychologie" (1854:94). It is the logic of representation that gives us the dialectic of reality; the fundamentat unavoidable, irreducible term is "representation." All knowledge and its objects-that is, all aspects of the real-must be accounted for in terms of representation. In Renouvier's thought, we do not encounter two distinct orders of being-mind and the world, or thought and things. He foilows Kant's revolution in epistemology in holding that representations are the true object of knowledge. There is, then, no logical separation between the real and representation. So, there is no access to reality independent of representation. Renouvier condemns ontologism, which purports to establish something independent of representation: it is logically impossible to do this because to identify the real we must use central features of representation. He argues that analysis reveals two poles of representation: these he calls the representative ("representatif') and the represented ("repmment"). These constitute the subject and the object poles of representation. The represented is what we would ordinarily call the object, and thus, in common</page><page sequence="7">Charles Renouvier and tmile Durkheim. Les R6g1es de la M6thode Sociologique 33 sense terms, the objective; it applies to nature or what is felt or perceived. It thus, in a philosophy where all is representation, constitutes the exterior aspect. Hamelin (1927:49) shows that Renouvier rejects both realism and materialism, and argues that this external aspect of representation is all that we need to account for this particular aspect of reality. These are incoherent philosophical positions for Renouvier: both imply something which is anterior to representation, and which would serve as its foundation. Within the perspective of epistemology, rather than "being without knowledge" ("Fte sans connai't"), we must always encounter representations, and these constitute the real foundation of knowledge and science. Further, for knowledge to be possible, the object must be in relation to the subject. For him, this means that the represented must always be in relation to a representative. There is no possibility of taking them separately. Similarly, Renouvier argues that there is no anterior or independent self that is the basis of representation: he rejects subjective materialism just as much as he rejects realism and materialism. The self is not privileged; all that we know of it is given within representation. What makes certain representations mine is that certain phenomena (e.g., sensations) are linked to others (e.g., nature) in such a manner to form a distinct whole. It is a whole which is composed of representations-which are phenomena. These are indicated by a common characteristic, "La Conscience." It should be noted that Durkheim uses this conception in the Preface to the second edition: "Whilst we have constantly repeated that conscience, whether individual or social was nothing substantial but a collection, more or less systematized, of sui generis phenomena, we have been accused of realism and ontologism" (1987:xi). But how, then, can social facts which are eminently human and therefore connected with the subject pole be treated as external? This is a problem of how we examine the subject, for these facts are constituted by practices, and therefore stem from the subject. For Renouvier, although the represented and the representative are always in relation, they are not entirely fixed. That is, the representative can become a represented to itself. This is something related to conscience, and therefore part of the subject pole can be rendered as a represented for the purposes of analysis. In Renouvier's words, it "dedoubles" or "s'objective"; it replicates itself for the purposes of analysis. This is only a point of method or analysis; it indicates how the mind or human consciousness, in examining itself and its products-action, becomes an object for itself. Whether this can be done and, in particular, without epistemological residue is outside the bounds of this paper. Renouvier argues that the common-sense ideas of subject and object establish "idols" and finally lead to absolute subjective idealism because they make the subject a particular, thinking subject which makes all things its objects. For him, common sense ignores the reality of representation as the condition of all knowledge and therefore objectivity. Thus, objectivity is not opposed to representation: it is the condition of any knowledge whatsoever. His logic of representation thus reverses ordinary usage. In this sense, what is human is not</page><page sequence="8">34 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECT[VES Volume 38, Number 1, 1995 thereby automatically opposed to the possibility of objectivity, for it is given in terms of representation as much as any material fact. The statement that follows this famous and controversial passage in Durkheim has not been frequently remarked upon: ,If this exteriority is only apparent, this illusion will dissipate as science advances, and we will see the outside return to the inside" (1987:28). This, I suggest, reflects Renouvier's view that in the final analysis, it is the fundamental principles of representation that make knowledge, and therefore science, possible. These are not given as part of the represented where science begins, but are fundamental to the representative side of representation. These are the laws of representation for Renouvier; they are what contemporary philosophers would call the rules of conceptual organization. Sensation is thus "external" to the conceptual grounding of experience. FUNCTIONAUSM AND SOCIAL FACTS In chapter two, Durkheim identifies functionalism as the method for achieving objective knowledge of phenomena; to be objective, we must study facts or phenomena in functional relationships. We must ask how the concept of function is compatible with representation and the nature of social phenomena as constituted practices. It was Renouvier who instituted functionalism in philosophy in France. In the first edition of his Logique, he argued that functionalism is a concept that originated in mathematics and indicated quantitative relations, but that it must be extended to qualitative relations and logical and causal relations. He was the first to extend the concept to "the general domain of science" (1854:60-64). Renouvier includes, for example, memory, imagination, and space as functional relations. Indeed, the mind itself is a set of functional relations. The significance of this is that it allows Durkheim to apply the concept of function to social relations-manners of being (W) and "pntiques cnstu6s." "'Function," for Renouvier, indicates at a general level the essential interrelatedness of relations (that is, if one set of relations changes, this will have consequences for others). So, for example in a psychological sense, the particular relations of childhood will have consequences for the adult and his/her relations. Therefore, one can say that adult relations are functionally dependent on childhood relations. And Renouvier expresses this philosophically through the connection he establishes between function and relation. Further, "function" indicates not static relations but changing, variable relations. Durkheim argues that we must note both the constant and the variable aspects of social life; the variable aspects are no less scientific than the constant (1987:40). NORMALITY In chapter three, Durkheim makes his famous and controversial distinction between the normal and the pathological. This is presaged by a discussion about the connection between science and action and, indeed, will. Both of these indicate</page><page sequence="9">Charles Rouvier and Anile Durkheinv Les RWgles de la M6thode Sociologique 35 a connection with the general republican interest in transformation, whose voice Renouvier's practical philosophy aimed to be. This aspect has been largely overlooked in the analysis of The Rules. Durkheim argues that generality is the external criterion of normality. Renouvier does not do this, but he does argue that the goal of science is the description and determination of general relations. It thus logically follows that the ideal should be found within the generaL Durkheim, however, uses normality to mean not just what is general and therefore present, but that which is some sense ideal and, therefore, not present. Later in The Rules, he argues that not all constraint is normnal constraint that is founded on power and wealth is not normal Only that which derives from some moral or intellectual authority is normaL This indicates a sense of normality that means rationally legitimate, and Renouvier does use the term in this way. He argues that it is the goal of republcan action to bring around "a normal and rational state of legitimacy" (1878:230). There is clearly an incompatibility between normal as general and normal as legitimate: it indicates a tension between the "is" and the "ought." The belef that this gap was being closed could be explained by the optimism that republcan interest in practical transformation would be successfuL It does not, however, overcome certain philosophical problems-that is, the problem of fact and value, the "is" and the "rought." There is a clear difference between Weber and Durkheim here: for Weber, there is a logical difference between statements of fact and statements of value. Statements of value rely on choice and the determination of final ends by the individual, while the former rely on publc empirical confirmation. Durkheim clearly believes, in contradistinction to Weber, that the determination of value is in some sense collective and publc and not uniquely individual or subjective. Evaluation, for Durkheim, is tied by relations of soldarity and, therefore, is closer to the relations which cover descriptions. TYPES The distinction Durkheim draws between a normality of fact and a normalty of right introduces us to the concept of types which is central to Renouvier's Logique. In chapter four, Durkheim argues that the great utility of this concept is that it allows a path between nominalism and extreme realism. Renouvier's Logique indicates how the concept of "espce" can mediate these two to reveal a middle ground, which shows the diversity of types of humanity. For Renouvier, the most general form of all phenomena is that they are relations. Relation is the most general law; all relations are given in experience under the general form of quality. This category answers the question "quel," the "whatever" of things. This means that all relations are identffied and distinguished. All aspects of the world to be known must be identffied with other things and separated from them. That they are related/identified with other things gives us the "genre": however, things are distinguished from each other. Thus, the logic of relation must make room for</page><page sequence="10">36 SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES Volume 38, Number 1, 1995 distinction-that is, for difference. The synthesis of identification and distinction is "esp?ce"-type. "Species (l'espece) is thus a synthesis of difference and kind" (1854:161) It is this logic of the real that allows Durkheim to argue that the value of the concept reconciles "both the unity which all genuine scientific research requires and the diversity which is given in the facts" (1987:77). Science requires general explanations but must be rooted in a specific set of local facts and details. This is espcially so in the human sciences. In chapter five, Durkheim argues that sociological explanation has a particular character: "The determining condition of social phenomena ... consists in the fact of association" (1987:111). He opposes this to the method of Comte and Spencer. Durkheim rejects Comte's explanation by reference to humanity and its inner tendency toward amelioration and Spencer's individualist explanation in terms of happiness. In other words, he rejects both psychologism and finalism in favor of explanation by social relations themselves, that is, between social facts that are solidary one with another. Thus, he argues that the determining condition of social phenomena consists in the fact of asociation. Association is the cause of all the new phenomena that are found in the course of the general evolution of things (1987:102). This fact of association for Durkheim suggests the "milieu social" as the determining factor of collective evolution. Renouvier established that relation is the supreme philosophical and scientific category, arguing against philosophical monism and for a plurality of relations as fundamental to a scientific philosophy. A plurality of relations always indicates relations between things. The fact of association thus gains philosophical significance in his rationalism, in a way that distinguishes it from Descartes and Kant. Further in his humanistic philosophy, Renouvier sees the relations between persons as a primary factor for philosophical explanation; it is he who argues in "Science de Morale" for ethical consideration of the social milieu as a crucial factor in moral action. By his focus on the fact of association, Renouvier indicated for Durkheim how the reality of society might be found in an association of consciences. This theory of conscience is foundational to the collective conscience which Durkheim uses in chapter five as part of his analysis of sociological explanation. The significant feature of the theory of conscience is that it is a theory of mind that requires relatedness in order to function. In other words, philosophically it requires human association; for Renouvier, this is essential not only for his epistemology but also for his moral philosophy. He enables Durkheim to argue, against classic rationalism, that the fact of association of consciences creates a specific reality which is irreducible to the constituent parts. Further, it enables him to argue that this collective consciousness is historically and socially specific-that is, it is only to be found within specific temporal relational structures. This follows from Renouvier's application of the critical intention; there can be no knowledge of relations outside of their specific expression in particular empirical relations, which are diverse. So, we find Durkheim rejecting Comte's conception of humanity as "ideological" in favor of knowledge of particular diverse societies.</page><page sequence="11">Charles Renouvier and kAmile Durkheim: Les R6gles de la M6thode Sociologique 37 Last, in chapter six, Durkheim argues that a conception of causality as efficient and as concomitantly variable suits the needs of a human science. Both of these claims were developed in the second edition of Renouvier's Logique. Durkheim begins his discussion with an analysis and rejection of Mill's conception: "But that pretended axiom of the plurality of causes is a negation of the principle of causality" (1987:126). In this, he echoes Renouvier's critique of Mill in the Logique. to identify causality as the totality of preceding conditions is to deny the real meaning of cause, which must not only be both necessary and sufficient but also the determinant of the effect. (1912:72-4). Renouvier elaborates his own view of causality, which draws on both Leibniz and Kant. The view of causality as concomitant variation expresses a relational view of causality. It is logically tied to the fact of association as the fundamental form of sociological explanation. It limits knowledge of causality to relations, such that one set of phenomena is given as antecedent and another phenomena is given as consequent. Causality must be understood as a constant connection ("liaison") between phenomena as links of each other (1912:72). The significance of this is that because it applies to relations philosophically, it can thereby be transferred to social relations. Thus, at each stage of The Rules, Durkheim calls on significant features of Renouvier's Logique to constitute the logic of the humanities. He does this not only because Renouvier was the most forceful republican voice but also because his particular version of a philosophical foundation of knowledge and science suits the interests of establishing a human science. That is, Renouvier indicated for Durkheim how the conception of a social reality can be made available to a scientific language and how accurate descriptions of social representation and action can be made. But the question can be raised of why, if Durkheim draws so consistently on Renouvier's LoAue, does he say his own rules are independent of all philosophy? Clearly, to argue for the nature of social reality as representations is not a-philosophical. Renouvier argued that his rationalist discourse was independent of the mythologies and fictions of all varieties of classical rationalism, empiricism, materialism, idealism, ontologism, and monism. It presents itself as a discourse of the real without "idologies" and "dead ends." Renouvier's Logique must not be understood in the narrow sense of logic as the study of principles of correct reasoning, whether inductive or deductive. Although he does deal with these in the context of his work, he has a wider brief. His Logique is concerned with the nature and limits of knowledge; the concern with the structure and principles of reasoning is logically subordinate to this. His Logique is thus a statement of the principles of knowledge, and second a statement of the means to acquire it. In this sense, his Logique has more in common with Kant's First Critique than with Aristotle's Pror and Posterior Analytics. His concern is with the nature of knowledge and with its limitation: like Kant, he believes that we fall into "darkness and confusion" if we overstep the boundaries of experience. Further, like Kant, he also believes that a true epistemology is a first science. His Logique is thus a reworking of Kant's First Critique, but without the dogmatism and contradictions that Renouvier claimed were the flaws of the Kantian system. In a sense, we could say that it is</page><page sequence="12">38 SOCOLOGICAL PERSPECIIVES Volume 38, Number 1, 1995 more Kantian in inspiration than a faithful transcription of the "architectonic" of the Kantian system. Renouvier prides himself on establishing a scientific epistemology that opposes itself to all forms of philosophizing which step outside the boundaries of knowledge. In particular, he attacks Hegel, Comte, and Kant himself for not being faithful to his own critical intention. For Renouvier, thus, as we have seen, knowledge consists in representations, and their fundamental relations. With Kant, for Renouvier, the question of the categories is the fundamental question of this scientific epistemology. And for both thinkers, causality is the key category of scientific thought. But unlike Kant, Renouvier brings the concepts of function and relation into much clearer philosophical focus. Relation is the key philosophical term for Renouvier: it is the foundation of both science and philosophy for him. It is on this basis that Durkheim can argue that the study of human relations is scientific. Both Kant and Renouvier believe that the principle of contradiction is essential to thought. For Renouvier, as for Kant, a truly scientific epistemology is emancipatory. He wrote the first volume of his Essais de Critique Gbrarle in 1854. He had been active in the revolution of 1848, and his Manuel Ripublicain de LHomme et Citoyen, published that year, caused the fall of the Minister, Camot. He left Paris after the Coup l4tat of 1851 and in ten years completed the system of Neo-Criticism, which was the kernel of his Loiue. He did not revoke his republican principles after the failure of the revolution of 1848. Rather, we can see that the dominant romantic, Hegelian ethos of this revolution was severely criticized by his scientific epistemology. Lack of a critical method leads to the failure of republicanism. Further, he extends the emancipatory implications of his scientific epistemology to an attack on antidemocratic politics. Al belief in a transcendent, an absolute in any form, is an illusion-an "idooge'-which leads to false politics. The attack on the absolute is a part of a democratic philosophy. This leads to the humanism which is a central aspect of his philosophy: "The exclusion of the absolute, the infinite and of substance leads to me anthropomorphism, which I forcefully re-habilitate" (Foucher 1927:182). This humanism is pursued in the "indefatigable spirit of science. My doctrine is humanist because human relations are represented there in the character of certain laws" (Foucher 1927:181). The particular quality of this approach to social reality, in its stress on fact, law, and function, has provoked accusations of positivism, against Durkheim. However, if we read Durkheim through Renouvier, then we can see that beneath this language is a concentration on representation and on action, and indeed evidence of concern with will and change. These are not characteristics of classic positivism. Renouvier argued that he accepted only one thing in his Logique from positivism: the reduction of knowledge to the laws of phenomena. This gives the language of fact and law that appears positivistic, but behind it lies a humanistic philosophy concerned with questions of epistemology, practical transformation, and action that are lacking from Comte's system. This, I suggest, explains why Durkheim can repudiate classical positivism, whilst sounding so positivistic.</page><page sequence="13">Charls nouvier and Anile Dukhinm Les R6gles de la Mthode Sociologique 39 In his methodological stance, Durkheim can be compared to both Bacon and Descartes. For Renouvier, the great importance of Descartes is that he focused on representation, whilst Bacon exemplified the spirit of the sciences. As Gaston Milhaud (1927:72) argued "The originality of Renouvier is to simultaneously oppose himself to dogmatic and empiricist philosophies, whilst at the same time being dose to both." It was Kant who showed how these two themes could be merged without contradiction in the concept of the critical intention. The Rulks focuses on collective representations which are the heart of social reality for Durkhei. These are grasped as facts under specific historical social conditions. Fact, law, function, and causality are all different aspects of the logic of representation for Renouvier. It was he, thus, who developed Kantianism towards the needs of a human science by drawing together the spirit of the sciences with the epistemological concern with representation. In this sense, his system was the starting point for Durkheim's sociology. REFERENCES Benton, T. 1977. Phiosophical Foundaions of the Three Sociolgies.
