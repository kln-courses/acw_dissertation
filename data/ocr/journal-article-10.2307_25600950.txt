<plain_text><page sequence="1">G D DONNA RICHARDSON An Anatomy of Solitude: Shelley's Response to Radical Skepticism in Alastor Shelley says of his poem alastor: or, the Spirit of Solitude that it allegorizes "one of the most interesting situations of the human mind,"1 and much effort has been expended to illustrate that this is so. In fact, the poem has been interpreted more often and in more ways than any other poem by Shelley, leading some interpreters to say that its major philosophical and moral issues are unresolvedly ambiguous.2 The poem probably has stimulated so many interpretations, especially interpretations focused on its philosophical assumptions,3 because of its i.

The more recent exponents of this position include Norman Thurston, in "Author, Narrator, and Hero in Shelley's Alastor," Studies in Romanticism 14 (1975): 126, and Lloyd Abbey, Destroyer and Preserver: Shelley's Poetic Skepticism (Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 1979) 29. 3. Among those who believe the poem makes a sufficiently determinate statement, opinion divides as to whether the basic theme of the poem is moral or more fundamentally philosophical. The former school of thought concludes that the poem is primarily a moral critique of extremely solitary communion with nature. Evan Gibson, "Alastor: A Rein terpretation," PMLA 62 (1947): 1027-34, and Kenneth Neill Cameron, Shelley: The Golden Years (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1974) 220-24 are two of the most classic, thorough exponents of this interpretation. A more recent interpretation which concentrates on the moral and psychological rather than the philosophical dimensions of the poem is William Crisman's "Psychological Realism and Narrative Manner in Shelley's Alastor and The Witch of Atlas," KSf 34 (1986). Increasingly, though, interpreters have seen this as a necessary but not sufficient account of the issues involved. To many, the Poet's visionary maid represents less the need for human love than the even more basic human desire for some certain knowledge about ultimate truths. The Poet's inability to find an objective correlative for his ideal is a comment on the impossibility of obtaining any such knowl edge, particularly of any metaphysical absolutes, when the phenomenal world is radically SiR, 31 (Summer 1992) 171</page><page sequence="2">172 DONNA RICHARDSON pivotal point in Shelley's career. It represents a fundamental retrench ment from the optimism of Queen Mab, and as such it has often been taken as establishing the philosophical groundwork for Shelley's later writing. Unlike Ian the in Queen Mab, whose vision gives her sufficient certainty and hope to align her will with a necessitarian Spirit of the Universe, the Poet in Alastor has a vision of a "veiled maid" embodying "knowledge and truth and beauty" for which he can find no objective correlative in nature. Interpreters have inferred from this failure that Alastor expresses Shelley's own rejection, not just of the idea that certain knowledge is possible, but also of any hope that an extramental reality can serve as a positive source of tentative knowledge. The prevailing interpretation of Shelley as a radically skeptical idealist is consistent with, and is often directly based on, the presence of such a rejection in Alastor. Few of Shelley's interpreters claim that he flatly denies the existence of a reality independent of consciousness. But they believe he initially privileges consciousness as a source of categories and uses utility or coherence rather than correspondence as a criterion for discriminating among perceptions. Nature is dismissed as irresolvably ambiguous with respect to the human condition, or as a source only of negative conclu sions about human limitations.4 deficient?mutable, meaningless, unresponsive to searches for meaning except for reflect ing back whatever humans project onto it. The poem may also be a moral cautionary tale warning against abandoning all human responsibility in the face of such metaphysical disappointment, but the disappointment is the primary issue. Representative expressions of this viewpoint include Harold Bloom, "The Unpastured Sea: An Introduction to Shelley," in Romanticism and Consciousness, ed. Harold Bloom (New York: Norton, 1970) 379, and Earl Wasserman, Shelley: A Critical Reading (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1971) 6, 33. Interpreters since Wasserman have tended to agree with his account of Alastor as expressing a radically skeptical position according to which the natural world is unre solvedly ambiguous. Such interpreters include Thurston and Abbey (see n. 2); Edward Strickland, "Transfigured Night: The Visionary Inversions of Alastor/' KSf 33 (1984): 150; and Christopher Heppner, "Alastor: The Poet and the Narrator Reconsidered," KSf 37 (1988): 106. 4. Earl Wasserman and Jerrold Hogle make two of the most comprehensive and rep resentative attempts to connect the supposed indeterminacy of phenomenal nature in Alastor and Shelley's subsequent idealism. Wasserman interprets Alastor as analogous to an irresolvable skeptical dialogue, in which "passive sensory perception" of nature "is not an act of knowledge, not a union of world and mind, despite the Narrator's claim, but only a mindless mirroring" (32). This denial that sensory nature offers any order or even any positive corrective to imagination clears the way, according to Wasserman, for an "objective idealism" based entirely on a coherence theory of truth in which the most nearly perfect orderings of imagination are more probably real than "misleading phenom ena" (149 passim). In Hogle's even more complex analysis of Alastor, nature similarly emerges as a "pole</page><page sequence="3">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 173 The text of Alastor, however, may concede less to both romantic and modern doubt than has been thought. The poem has been generally, and accurately, construed as denying the certainties about metaphysical issues found in Queen Mab. It explicitly rejects the assertion in Words worth's The Excursion that mind and nature are so "fitted" to each other they can experience a "wedded" union.5 In repudiating this metaphor, Shelley denies that phenomenal experience can provide any knowledge sufficient for the kind of certainty and emotional grace figured in Chris tian thought as the soul's marriage with Christ the bridegroom.6 But of existence" which is discovered to provide no absolute center and which offers only "an incoming confluence of elements from many different quarters receding back into an endless and 'deepening' departure at the same time" (Shelley's Process [New York: Oxford, 1988] 60). Mind itself is less fully constituted in Hogle's account than in Wasserman's; the radical ambiguity of nature is due as much to the fact that our apprehension of nature "is a verbal composition made from symbolic figures" which are themselves indeterminate in origin as to nature's also being "but one emerging modification of an advancing and withdrawing (Necessity-like) movement that the mind can neither contain nor control" (60). But as in Wasserman's interpretation, the narrator of the poem is left futilely desiring a source and center, trying "to ground and repress" the "vast relational exchange" of thought, though inadvertently being "forced to manifest it" (57). Consequently the poem is "a critique of [Shelley's] predecessors" but "they still frame his discourse. The Alastor Poet's story ends up enveloped in Wordsworthian mother-worship" when the Poet's quest fails (61). Not only is nature radically unknowable. Apparently, any determinacy which might be put on the flux of the vast relational exchange by some correspondences between nature and mind would be a hindrance rather than a help toward moral decision-making, since the one hope latent in the process narrator and Poet try to repress is "the verbal extension of the self's desire toward the desire of others, the self seeking (and thus losing) itself in different forms" (57). One infers that, as in much discourse proceeding from deconstructive origins, Hogle is attributing freedom, morality, and going beyond the self to movements of unhampered flux, while attributing tyranny, limitation, and selfishness to any limits upon the freeplay of thought. 5.

The history of this originally biblical metaphor is traced by Meyer Abrams in Natural Sup er naturalism (New York: Norton, 1971) 43-47 ff. Abrams' discussion of the Christian evolution of this metaphor, particularly of its eventual form in medieval mysticism?the apocalyptic spiritual marriage of the individual soul as bride with the bridegroom Christ? is a highly important contribution to understanding the background for Wordsworth's metaphor and Shelley's criticism of it. However, Abrams' and other mythopoetic critics' claim that this metaphor was usually reinterpreted by the romantics as casting the auton omous human imagination in the role of God/Christ and nature in the role of the passive bride is, I believe, precisely the kind of relation to nature which Shelley is questioning in Wordsworth. It is even dubious whether Wordsworth takes the relation to imply a predom inance of mind over nature, since he appears to be deliberately ambiguous about the sex</page><page sequence="4">174 DONNA RICHARDSON the more original, unrecognized purpose of Alastor is to criticize the opposite extreme represented by the Poet's despair, especially the con clusion that if it is impossible to derive absolute grounds for knowledge from phenomena, no objective, empirically-based knowledge is possi ble. On the contrary, Alastor implies that denying significant human relation to nature because nature provides no certainties is as much an error of human egotism as are the egotistical sublime and the pathetic fallacy. I will explore the philosophy developed in the poem by addressing three consecutive interpretive cruxes in the poem?the relation of Shelley to the narrator and the Poet, the nature of the Poet's vision, and the meaning of the Poet's long journey which occupies the last half of the poem. Shelley, who can be identified with the narrator,7 uses the Poet to question the assumption that certainty is essential to knowledge, an assumption underlying the Poet's radical skepticism as well as Words worthian natural piety. The narrator suggests that the Poet's frustrated insistence on seeking such certainty implies a desire for self-centered solitude in its most ultimate form. He then uses the Poet's vision and subsequent journey to articulate indirectly an epistemological process which provides an alternative to both absolutism and radical skepticism about empirically-based knowledge. The Poet's vision is only partly a projection of his desires; it is also an interpretation, though a highly of both "mind" and nature in both the Prospectus and The Excursion itself. Human soul and mind are twice described using female pronouns in the Prospectus (12, 20), as well as in Book 1 of the poem (66-68). In the same book nature is both definitely female (263 68) and arguably male (a force by which many Poets are "sown," 77-78, and which "subduejs]" the Wanderer in his "first virgin passion of a soul / Communing with the glorious Universe," 282?86). Though the gender-categories remain traditional (and sexist), the ascription of them to nature and "man" do not. Even Wordsworth seems to consider Nature an equal partner rather than a passive thing to be formed by the male god of imagination. 7. It has not been traditional to use Occam's razor on Shelley's rhetorical strategy in this poem. As Heppner points out, interpreters since Wasserman have generally accepted his contention that the narrator is not a spokesman for Shelley but instead is treated ironically as a separate character who undercuts his own Wordsworthian pantheism by the narrative he relates (Heppner 92). Heppner contends, as I do, that the narrator is, as one might reasonably expect from his rhetorical situation, a stable character in control of his own narrative and a spokesman for Shelley (106-7). But Heppner makes this claim at the expense of attributing to the Poet what rhetorically appears to be the narrator's opening invocation to the muse (95). My assumption, more simply, is that the narrator, a spokes man for Shelley, speaks the opening invocation and everything else which he does not obviously attribute to the Poet. The reason for previous attributions of excessive rhetorical complexity to the poem is, I think, an attempt to avoid ascribing to Shelley what has seemed to be a Wordsworthian invocation to the muse. I argue that this opening invocation is Shelleyan, but not Wordsworthian.</page><page sequence="5">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 175 erroneous one, of the mysteries underlying the universe which he has previously experienced in his encounters with nature, and a more in nocent version than that presented in Queen Mab of how people create gods and other fixed concepts to explain these mysteries. In the last half of the poem, the narrator's description of the landscape through which the Poet travels shows how some tentative knowledge can be derived by interpreting such private experiences as his dream in the light of more frequent and sharable empirical perceptions of nature. In short, although the poem is a romantic elegy to the lost possibility of attaining metaphysical certainty in any form, it also lays the ground work for a relatively traditional, if unusually tentative, romantic panthe ism which is anything but traditional epistemologically. This pantheism is based, not on the domination of imagination over empirical experience and rational analysis, but on a partnership among them more compatible with scientific method than is the case in most romantic philosophies. I. Varieties of Solitude and Their Moral Implications: Wanderer, Poet, and Narrator One of the most disputed issues regarding Alastor has been the relation ship of the narrator to the Poet. This relationship directly involves the question of how Shelley uses the poem as a comment on Wordsworth's poetry, particularly The Excursion, and whether either the Poet or the narrator represents, as many have suggested, a Wordsworthian perspec tive.8 It also involves the question of rhetorical structure and its episte 8. Paul Mueschke and Earl Griggs, in "Wordsworth and the Prototype of the Poet in Shelley's Alastor" PMLA 49 (1934): 229-45, first pointed out both the many Words worthian phrases in Alastor, most of them borrowed from The Excursion and the Immortality ode, and the fact that the Shelleys read The Excursion immediately prior to the composition of Alastor. Mueschke and Griggs' idea that the Poet represents Wordsworth in his decline is, however, contradicted by the Poet's entirely un-Wordsworthian rejection of external nature as "blind" and "deaf" to him. Other interpreters have suggested that the Poet has his model in the Solitary of The Excursion (Bloom 378). However, although both characters reject the world because of its mutability, the Solitary despairs because he has loved and lost a real woman and hope for political liberty, whereas the Poet has never found or sought any comfort in either. Earl Wasserman suggests that the closest parallel to the Poet in The Excursion is Margaret; the narrator describes the Poet's death due to lack of love just as the Wanderer describes Margaret's death due to her loss of her husband (20). Wasserman concludes that Shelley "corrected the theme" of The Excursion by implying that the truly imaginative spirit seeks some ultimate ideal higher than the human love for which Margaret pines, something "absent because it can have no existence on earth" (20). I will argue that the Poet occupies the rhetorical position of the Solitary?the figure being criticized for some form of excessive solitude?but that the Poet is primarily compared and contrasted with the Wanderer, in a thoroughgoing critique of Wordsworth's entire concept of solitude and communion with nature.</page><page sequence="6">176 DONNA RICHARDSON mological implications. The most influential account of this issue, that of Earl Wasserman, maintains that the poem is rhetorically analogous to a skeptical dialogue because the Wordsworthian narrator is brought by his own narration to entertain the Poet's irresolvable skepticism about nature (Wasserman 15, 38). Shelley does use the two characters to comment upon and criticize Wordsworth's multifaceted analysis of solitude in The Excursion. But neither the Poet nor the narrator of Alastor represents a perspective which could be attributed to Wordsworth or his Wanderer. The structure of the two poems is similar: after invocations to the muse, Shelley's nar rator and the Wanderer are presented as spokesmen for the authors' positive versions of solitary communion with nature, after which the stories of the Poet and Solitary are presented as negative contrasts ex hibiting more extreme, destructive forms of solitude. But by implicitly contrasting the Poet's career with the Wanderer's, Shelley suggests they share the problematic belief that nature is only relevant to human knowl edge if it can be possessed in a "wedded" union, i.e. if it yields certain knowledge and sufficiently fulfills human definitions of the good. Shel ley implies that this marital metaphor self-contradictorily entails, not mature marital communion, but the egocentrism of Oedipal desire. The narrator steers a course between faith in and despair over the possibility of such a union between mind and nature. He can discover "enough" imperfect, probabilistic knowledge from earthly beings and does not demand complete satisfaction from the Spirit of Nature itself. Shelley contrasts the vision and subsequent career of the Poet with those of the Wanderer not only to criticize Wordsworth's views but also to express points of agreement with them. As many have noted, Shel ley's epistemology is closer to that of Wordsworth than to that of anyone else Shelley read. Both poets espouse the general romantic belief that imagination has a vital constitutive role in perception, adding feeling and unifying structure to sense-impressions. But more than many other romantics, they also believe that we receive from as well as give to phenomenal nature, especially in the early stages of mental development. Accordingly, Shelley describes the Poet's career as being initially similar to the Wanderer's. Both leave the influence of society and build up a stock of experiences from direct contact with nature. Both have visions of some metaphysical ideal that depends upon the cognitive content of these previous experiences as well as on their morally sensitizing effects. The effects of these culminating visions on the two, however, could hardly be more different. The Wanderer becomes permanently fulfilled and attracted toward suffering humanity, while the Poet sinks into despair because he cannot have the maiden of his vision, and he neglects</page><page sequence="7">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 177 not only himself but also any responsibility for relating to others. As a criticism of "the spirit of solitude," this difference is a comment on the ontological solitude of the mental state the Wanderer possesses and the Poet longs for?the "wedded" union between a nature and human mind "fitted" to each other which is the central metaphor in the "Prospectus" to The Excursion. Shelley denies the possibility of such a relation by analyzing the implications of the metaphor more thoroughly than does Wordsworth. This metaphor implies more satisfaction than human beings could ever receive from a non-anthropomorphic universe prior to and more comprehensive than human mind. By implicitly contrasting the Wanderer's and Poet's reactions to vision, Shelley suggests that neither character finds anything very spousal in his relations with nature. Wordsworth grants the Wanderer a perfect communion in the form of a vision imaged as sexual possession, as "intercourse" and being "possessed" (The Excursion i.220-21), but this possession is passive, un sensual, and almost exclusively visual. "Sensation, soul, and form, / All melted into him" (207-8), but the Wanderer's experience and consequent certainty that he possesses the truth are gained only by looking at nature. "He looked?"; he could "read / Unutterable love" in the clouds; his "feeling" of faith results from the fact that "nor did he believe,?he saw" (200, 204-5, 232)- Sound is excluded from the sensations he feels (205 6); the clouds rather than he are "touched" (203); and the drinking by his spirit is only a metaphor for seeing ("his spirit drank / The spectacle, " 206-7). Moreover, his response to all this stimulation is purely passive (207-8, 221). Actually, the experience is not only insufficient but also unnecessary for belief, since the Wanderer has already accepted his re ligion as a result of reading the Bible and merely has its authority emotively confirmed by his vision (222?26). Shelley's later skepticism about the intensity of Wordsworthian vision and therefore about its veracity is summed up in the lines from Peter Bell in which call Wordsworth/Peter a "moral eunuch" because "he touched the hem of Nature's shift / Felt faint?and never dared uplift / The closest, all-concealing tunic" (iv. 313-17). In Alastor, the Poet's ex perience of and response to vision are in ironic contrast with the Wan derer's. The Poet's entire sensory, intellectual, and emotional being is overwhelmed by a synaesthetic assault on all his senses at once, and his intense response certainly implies an intent to lift the tunic (or in this case, veil) and have sex with his visionary maid. Although the Wanderer may be satisfied with an abstract, Platonic vision, the Poet's response to vision implies that Shelley believes all the senses together, especially touch, must convince the body that the world and its mysterious un derlying causes are heaven or hell. Shelley, like Blake and Keats, often</page><page sequence="8">178 DONNA RICHARDSON dwells graphically on the physicality of death in a way Wordsworth seldom does. By insisting on the full logic of the sexual metaphor, Alastor implies that a merely visual experience is unlikely to convince the senses that there is abundant recompense for the reality of suffering and death. It is hard to say what so profoundly shook Shelley's faith in the adequacy of the visionary experience he depicted with such confidence in Queen Mab. But whatever may have precipitated the change, there are plenty of problems with Ianthe's experience in Queen Mab, which he seems to have realized are much like those he implicitly criticizes in the Wanderer's experience. Ianthe, like the Wanderer, seems to achieve a state of cognitive and emotional grace after experiencing a complete sensory, emotional, and intellectual apprehension of the universe. But Shelley never does present a sensory image of Ianthe's experience ade quate to justify the sweeping metaphysical conclusions Mab deduces from this image in the rest of the poem. All he actually presents is a purely visual panorama of a mechanistic cosmos, accompanied by an assertion that it feels "wonderful" and includes sufficient moral harmony revealed through natural appearances.9 Moreover, like the Wanderer who already has knowledge of God from the Bible before he experiences him in nature, Ianthe is already of "resolute mind" before she has her vision; in fact, the vision is a reward for her resoluteness (ix.200-205). So the evidence most necessary to verify her vision?the motivation of her will by means of this vision to fulfill its part in the self-perfection of Necessity's will?is vitiated. As its preface suggests, Alastor more realistically recognizes that contemplation of "objects infinite and un measured, " some panoramic visual image of universal harmony such as Ianthe's, does "cease to suffice." No sensory perception in vision, and therefore no later concept based on that perception, is ever adequate to capture the deep truth, much less to persuade the visionary that this truth is sufficiently harmonious to satisfy the deepest human longings and fears. g. Donald Reiman, in Intervals of Inspiration (Greenwood, Florida: Penkevill, 1988) 234, has noted the fundamental disparity between what Queen Mab tells Ianthe (that what Ianthe can see of human destiny within the evolving natural world is sufficient for happiness) and the implications of the pedagogical method (that she must be separated from her natural body, taken to a cosmic vantage point, and didactically lectured by Queen Mab in order to be convinced). Whatever the details of the philosophy expressed in the poem?a rational Holbachian determinism, as Reiman believes, or a belief in some more immaterial Necessity with outwardly mechanistic appearances, as I would suggest?Mab tells rather than shows Ianthe that the world's evils evince sufficient harmony to make Ianthe intellectually convinced and morally resolute.</page><page sequence="9">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 179 The contrasting metaphors involving "seeing the light" in Words worth's Immortality ode and in the poem of Shelley's besides Alastor most influenced by this ode, Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, further show the crucial difference between Wordsworth and Shelley on this point. Like his Wanderer, Wordsworth can retain "embers" of philosophical thought and belief in later years even after the experience of seeing the light has faded, because in his youth the child intuitively "beholds the light, and whence it flows" (133, 69). But the young Shelley never sees the light in the Hymn?only its shadow?and therefore cannot retain even the grace of certain knowledge once the grace of direct perception and feeling passes. Hence the elegiac tone at the end of Alastor over the loss of possibility represented by the Poet's fate, a loss even of hope for the knowledge Wordsworth is left to make do with at the end of the Immortality ode. In Shelley's rephrasing, we are left with inconsolable "woe" rather than more hopeful "thoughts" lying "too deep for tears" (713). By portraying the Wanderer's and Poet's relations with other people as nearly identical, however, Shelley suggests that the urge to penetrate nature's secrets is egocentrically solitary in its effects whether or not the visionary believes he can achieve it in this life. After his fulfilling vision, the Wanderer relates to other people as a friend, father, or brother (470, 499, 923)&gt; observing and commenting detachedly on the agonies of others such as the bereaved Margaret. He holds slightly aloof from the mutability and mortality in human relations and is comforted for human losses, mostly other people's, by speculations on immortality (917-56, 780-90). As Wordsworth says with unintentional irony, "He could afford to suffer / With those whom he saw suffer" (370-71). The Poet treats people with almost the same detached, distant kindness as the Wanderer because his mind, too, has been focused on higher things by his vision. The only real difference is that neither the Poet nor the maidens he encounters find such a relationship satisfactory. The maidens call the Poet a "brother" and "friend" (269), much as the Wanderer is a "brother" to other people, and the terms represent about the same degree of intimacy. These names are called "false, " not because the Poet is unkind, but because the maidens desire and deserve more than a brother. This parody of the Wanderer's relationships suggests that Shelley finds Wordsworth's ideal a self-contradictory account of love. Rather than representing any sort of mature love, a "wedded" union with nature could be the ultimate form of self-centered solitude, if it causes the visionary to seek or rest satisfied with a private communion between himself and some universal principle. Such communion vitiates any need for lesser objects of love and therefore any motivation to sympathize</page><page sequence="10">180 DONNA RICHARDSON with the pains of ordinary mortals. (The Poet believes himself to be in such a state of mind before his vision, when he is oblivious to the Arab maid's pain; appropriately, the preface says that at this time he is "self possessed.") Even if such a union is impossible or uncertain of fulfill ment, the ideals of satisfaction and certainty promised by such a concept can undermine the ability to accept any less perfect love and to make the compromises of self-interest necessary to such love. The narrator takes a position between the Wanderer's absolute faith and the Poet's despair over all knowledge based on empirical experience. The narrator's opening comments, which recast the invocation to the muse in The Excursion, show he knows that when one lifts the "painted veil" or closest tunic one won't find things to love?or at least, to love possessively. Rather than seeking or claiming a lover's possession of nature's "mysteries" (28), the narrator is content to address nature as a mother (2, 18) and aspects of nature as kindred (15). He recognizes his own being and desires as in some important degree separate from the love and harmony which pervade nature. He does not participate inti mately in "Spring's voluptuous pantings" (11) because they represent a separate intercourse among his "brethren" who have the same mother but are not appropriate objects of his desire. He also resists lusting after an even more inappropriate object. In Freudian terms, he recognizes and controls his Oedipus complex; he accepts the "unfathomable" nature of his mother, the world (18), and can accept knowing "enough," the fact that there does exist such a reality, without demanding a more intimate penetration of nature's "in most sanctuary" (38?39). He images his partial understanding in terms more fully explored in Hymn to Intellectual Beauty. He has watched only nature's "shadow" and the "darkness" or her steps; he has gazed at the "depth" of her "deep mysteries" rather than at the mysteries themselves (31-33). Insofar as he cannot entirely resist the desire for total communion, the narrator is a more civilized wooer of the truth than the Poet. Instead of "overleap[ing] the bounds" (207) and trying to grab the truth like the Poet, he "mixed awful talk and asking looks / With . . . most innocent love, until strange tears / Uniting with those breathless kisses, made / Such magic as compels the charmed night / To render up her charge" (34-38), and he waits courteously for nature herself to "unveil" her "inmost sanctuary" (40). The narrator's more courtly wooing of nature exposes a further moral consequence of seeking an understanding of nature imaged as sexual communion. Both Poet and Wanderer desire a truth which will make them self-sufficient by gratifying their deepest needs. But they seek this truth from a remote universal less like them</page><page sequence="11">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 181 than human objects of love, and relationships with people require some sacrifice of one's own desires. A relationship with the unhuman Spirit described in Queen Mab would have to involve a far greater degree of self-compromise than any human relation?or it would have to be a totally one-sided Oedipal relation in which the remote Other did all the giving. The narrator's comprehension of nature is thus both less complete and more profound than the Wanderer's. Like the Poet, he understands that humans desire more than any detached, purely visual "vision" can reveal. But unlike the Poet he concedes that humans must, and can, rest content with not possessing the mystery. His metaphors imply we are part of the phenomenal world?born of it?and not even the favorite or heir of Mother Nature at that (though perhaps we are fire, the one element left out of the invocation to natural "kindred" in line i). We can never penetrate the secrets of a mother prior to and greater than ourselves. But what we cannot experience directly in our mother and kindred we may partly learn by analogies between ourselves and na ture?especially between human love and what Queen Mab termed the "loves and hatreds" of every atom (iv.146), the forces that drive all modes of being and which can be inferred from observation and sym pathetic identification if not directly experienced. The narrator may not have the embers of certain knowledge left from his perceptions, but "enough" has "shone" within him and been shown by nature so that he patiently awaits further inspiration from the "Great Parent" (39-49). And there seems to be a greater moral grace in his recognition that all other modes of being are unknowable mysteries than in the Poet's possessiveness. According to the Hymn, what we desire is dear for its grace but "dearer for its mystery," for exceeding our ability to appro priate it and reduce it to our radically limited selves. II. Generous Error: The Poet's Maid and the Believer's God The narrator's tentative realism is based not only on his own experience but also on the problems he dramatizes in the Poet's epistemology. The Poet's initial mistake lies not in fabricating the truth but in misinter preting it, in a way which Shelley implies is an archetypal pattern caused by the limits of human understanding and the strength of human desire to overleap those limits. The second major interpretive crux of Alastor is whether the Poet's vision is subjective projection, as the statement that "he images to himself the being he loves" in the preface might suggest, or whether the vision is a perception of an objective truth "sent" to the Poet from without, as lines 198-205 imply. Most recent criticism maintains that the Poet merely projects his needs, either for</page><page sequence="12">182 DONNA RICHARDSON human companionship or for some ultimate metaphysical communion, onto a universe which may contain the former but not the latter.10 The Poet's vision, however, is depicted as a combination of objective per ception and purely subjective wish-fulfillment, of truth and error. The Poet's mental processes parallel closely the origin of religion as described in Canto vi of Queen Mab, the creation of a false anthropomorphic image to make the unfathomable mysteries of the universe sufficiently comprehensible. Like the believer, the Poet denies the source of his conception in the manifold natural mysteries he has experienced and takes the one part of the conception which is entirely projective?its unifying anthropomorphic form?to be the essential quality of a god head. Shelley selects a character who fabricates this particular image of the deep truth, and who becomes, unlike the narrator, irrevocably fixated on its unreal qualities, both to mourn and epistemological limitations of even the most imaginative people and to warn that such people are particularly susceptible to the "generous error," as the preface puts it, fostered by these limitations. Since even the Poet's most "illustrious superstition" of communion with the universe, a beautiful wedded union rather than the rule of a power-god, has no natural correlative, the narrator mourns the fact that every individual must endure a significant degree of metaphysical solitude. Worse, since there is no absolute cor respondence between the universe and human desires, all conceptions will be tainted with some anthropomorphic and egocentric distortions. But the Poet's example also proves these limitations can lead further to a fixed, destructive error?more often, in fact, in the case of superior spirits, who are more likely to be attracted by such apparently ideal concepts as religious dogma or the Wanderer's self-possessed solitude wedded to nature. Able to place their hopes in a myth of metaphysical communion, instead of in imperfect human love, those with strong imaginations may be all the more devastated and alone if they discover such myths are unrealizable. They then make themselves into spirits of a totally solipsistic solitude, unable to do anything but spread alienation to others rather than alleviate it. In Queen Mab, Shelley says that religion, which he apostrophizes as an "untutored youth," found its ignorance "reproached" by the wonders and mysteries of the universe, so it summed up "the elements" of all it knew in nature and "their causes" and "converged" them to "an abstract point" with the shape of a human ruler (vi.90-110). The fatal irony in this imaginative convergence is that the religious identify the purely io. Cameron 223; Wasserman 22-23; Gibson 1028; Bloom 368; Abbey 24-27.</page><page sequence="13">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 183 human elements of this conception?anthropomorphic form, emotions, rationality?as the essential attributes of gods, since they would rather have evil but comprehensible gods than unknowable mysteries. Shelley implies this point when he equates purportedly benevolent gods with frankly evil ones in a blacklist of divine names, and when he says that "human pride" invents these names to hide its ignorance and to make itself "partners of [gods'] power" (vii.24-40). Though the Poet's "god dess" is beautiful and benevolent, she is the result of a similar error. The Poet mistakes the purely subjective elements in the image he has created in response to nature's mystery for the essence of the mystery itself. Although the Poet interprets his dream as referring to an ideal tran scending the "empty scene" of nature, the dream is largely a reflection of his previous encounters with nature. As a result, the more he subjects himself to what he believes is a transcendent ideal, the more he and his conception become passive mirrors of nature. Whereas the narrator watched nature's steps and shadow and appreciated their deep mystery, similar imagery implies that even before his dream the Poet was a passive mirror in direct proportion to the aggressiveness of his pursuit of na ture's mysteries: "Nature's most secret steps / He like her shadow has pursued" (81-82). The Poet's dream, too, is largely a reflection of what he has sensed before. Not only is the form taken by his vision a delayed response to the Arab maid. More immediately, his dream occurs in a bower "where odorous plants entwine [by] a sparkling rivulet" (146, 148). So it is not surprising that the content of his dream involves odors and music "like woven sound of streams and breezes" (155). When he awakes and despairs because "the hues of heaven that canopied his bower" and "the sounds that soothed his sleep" have "fled" (196-99), he believes these sensations were caused by a purely supernatural object, as implied by his subsequent "doubts" that phenomenal nature contains only emptiness, whereas death may lead him to his vision (209-21). But the description of these hues and sounds applies better to the natural phenomena which were the external stimuli causing his dream, and which are still present. The simile describing the Poet's feelings at this point ("His wan eyes / Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly / As ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven," 200-202) ironically implies that the scene is "vacant" because of his passive, unsympathetic interpretation of it; the scene is the reality ("moon in heaven") and he the vacant reflection ("ocean's moon"). The Poet has absorbed and projected "the magnificence and beauty of the external world, " in the words of the preface, then repressed the source of that magnificence. Besides mistaking the source of his vision, the Poet idolizes the one feature not present in the natural mysteries he experienced?a unitary, anthropomorphic form. A comparison of the Poet's vision with others</page><page sequence="14">184 DONNA RICHARDSON representing Shelley's point of view reveals that the only element unique to this vision is the "veiled maid." The Poet experiences the message of the maid's "music," "knowledge and truth and beauty," through a synaesthetic "web / Of many-colored woof and shifting hues," and through an auditory web "like woven sound of streams and breezes" (155?57). This message recalls the sensations of Ianthe and the narrators in Alastor and the Hymn. Although the latter two visions are not de scribed, they leave the perceivers with "enough" to suggest that there may be a universal Spirit underlying the multiplicity of sensations, and each narrator describes either the object of vision or hope for future inspiration in terms of interwoven sensations. Moreover, just as the content of the Poet's vision is "knowledge and truth and beauty" and "lofty hopes of divine liberty" (158-59), the Hymn narrator's vision lets him hope the Spirit would "free / The world from its dark slavery." Since the only difference between the Poet's vision and these others is that the Poet, as the preface says, "attaches all of wonderful, or wise or beautiful" to an image of a woman, this image appears to be a projection he makes to comprehend the mystery underlying nature. His interpretation of the anthropomorphic element in his image as the very essence of some objective ideal is signalled to be an error in other ways. Not only are the impressions and human figure sensual and un ideal. The "woven" appearance of the vision is explicitly described as a "veil" and as "many-coloured." In Adonais and other later poems, such veils are lovely approximations of the Ideal which nevertheless "stain," i.e. conceal and distort, "the white radiance of eternity." The content of the Poet's dream reflects Shelley's belief that people feel compelled to comprehend the universe but can only do so imper fectly by projecting necessarily incomplete and egocentrically-generated images. Even the narrator uses the anthropomorphic metaphor of a mother to describe his sense of the world. But the Poet also exemplifies how people tend to make a human limitation into a destructive, fixated error. The process of mind which leads to his projecting this particular image and to misinterpreting it so irrevocably suggests why people are not only unable to grasp the nature of the universe fully but also insist that the form of their desire is the substance of reality. As Shelley describes the progress of emotional growth in On Love (473-74), it is an endless process of moving out from egocentrism toward a love of the good in everything that exists. We first perceive an ideal prototype of what we value in ourselves, then seek the antitype of this image in the world. Since, as this essay says, we are never fully satisfied with what we discover, but also, as the Defence implies, love represents some degree of successful identification with "thought, action</page><page sequence="15">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 185 or person, not our own" (487), apparently partial success makes it possible to identify with things increasingly unlike ourselves, while the lack of total satisfaction drives us to continue. This precarious dialectic of love differs from Neoplatonic descriptions in the inaccessibility of the ideal and in the stages of development. "On Love" implies there is no image which can represent "the invisible and unattainable point to which Love tends." Indeed, the essay begins by implying that the writer has encountered continual rebuffs in trying to find the antitype of his desire. There is no progression from the sensory and material to an immaterial Platonic sun of truth, no escape from earth to the center of the universe as in Queen Mab. People are children of nature, not superior to it, and will always have perceptions distorted by their local, sublunary perspective (which may account for Shelley's shift from Copernican to Ptolemaic metaphors in this and later poems). But there are still discernible stages in going out from the self to the whole?and, just as there was much consistent knowledge accurate to the human condition in the Ptolemaic system, knowledge and morality can be developed even within a limited, conditional perspective. The preface to Alastor asserts that the closest approximation to our own prototype is other people ("The intellectual faculties, the imagination, the functions of sense, have their respective requisitions on the sympathy of corresponding powers in other human beings," 69). "On Love" suggests it is more difficult, but still possible, to love "the trees, and the grass and the water and the sky" when "in solitude" or among unsym pathetic people. Even concern for a paper nautilus can bring Cythna back from self-absorbed madness in The Revolt of Islam. But if one has not first loved other people, in whatever imperfect degree, it would be almost impossible, even seriously thwarting, to skip stages and to iden tify with something more cognitively and emotionally alien. These differences between traditional accounts and Shelley's suggest why Wordsworthian solitude is, in Alastor, the most dangerous of ap parently noble illusions. Ironically, perhaps the Poet's very superiority of imagination makes him find other people inadequate and makes him able to feel, as few can, that the pursuit of nature's spiritual mysteries may be more fulfilling than his "cold fireside and alienated home" (76). But like many an ascetic seeker of spiritual truth before him, the Poet, however innocently, has developed no capacity for communion with other people; not long before his dream he ignores the attentions of an amorous Arab maid. So, in the words of the preface, when the mysteries of the universe awaken his sympathies to the inadequacy of self but these "objects infinite and unmeasured" prove inaccessible and "cease to suffice," his "thirst for an intercourse with" a kindred "intelligence"</page><page sequence="16">186 DONNA RICHARDSON leads him to commit two acts which together constitute a fatal error. First, he projects a "form" originating from repressed need for that most like his own prototype, rather than from any objective perception of a unifying form in nature, to comprehend the mysteries he has previously experienced in nature. Second, he mistakes the image itself for the ideal mystery and pursues this image as a super-human ideal, rather than concluding that love of other human beings is the most complete and immediate "form" in which he can realize whatever degree of harmony there is between human desire and the universe. Both the particular form of this image and his inability to consider that it might have another meaning than he initially gave it suggest that trying to love nature first will not lead to love of man?and may well have the opposite effect. The nature of the Poet's error is further elaborated by the parallel Shelley makes between the Poet and Endymion. Although it is a com monplace of Keats studies that his Endymion is a response to Alastor,11 even the most extensive scholarly work on the Endymion myth omits Alastor as a version of the myth.12 Like most who used this myth,13 Shelley interprets Endymion as a lover of divine truth and beauty. The Poet is enslaved by the moon after a dream; he is compared with the moon (200-203) and becomes "wan" as the moon wanes from the full right after his dream ("low in the west" at sunrise, 194) to a last quarter when he is at sea ("at midnight / The moon arose," 351-52). He dies, in a cave, as the new crescent sets (645-62), and like the tide responding to the moon his pulse has always "beat in mystic sympathy / With Nature's ebb and flow" (652-53). But as this last quotation ironically indicates, the goddess by which he is enslaved is anything but the transcendent universal he takes her to be. The moon is identified by the narrator with ever-changing nature, and its realm is definitely sublunary; the moon is actually identified with the most transient and (to science il. Leonard Brown, "The Genesis, Growth, and Meaning of Endymion," Studies in Philology 30 (1933): 646. Brown minutely details the structural parallels between Alastor and Keats's Endymion (628-54) t&gt;ut omits all the references to the moon in Alastor which suggest that Shelley uses the content of the myth as well as an analogous narrative structure. 12. Edward S. Lecomte, Endymion in England (New York: King's Crown Press, 1944) cites Shelley's explicit references to the Endymion myth in Epipsychidion (63) and The Witch of Atlas (19) and notes the analogy between the myth and the union of Earth and Moon in Act iv of Prometheus Unbound. But he mentions Alastor only as a source against which Keats reacted in Endymion, without finding any hint of the myth in Alastor itself. 13. Lecomte describes many nineteenth-century interpretations of the myth which see Endymion's union with Cynthia as a metaphor for the meeting of divine and earthly love (131-51).</page><page sequence="17">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 187 in Shelley's time) atmosphere-bound celestial phenomenon, a "meteor" (551). The Poet's female image doesn't even represent this sublunary nature as a whole. The poem suggests that this image has its more direct objective correlative, and probably its unconscious psychological stim ulus, in the Arab maid, i.e. human love as one partial manifestation of natural harmony. Before his dream, the maid "watches his nightly sleep" (134) as Cynthia watched Endymion, and at daybreak, which makes "paler the pale moon," the Arab maid too returns home "wildered and wan and panting" and virginal (138-39). According to this use of the myth, there is a true meaning to the Poet's dream which he has mis understood. One can hardly commune with a remote, unhuman uni versal if he "overleaps the bounds, " skipping rungs on Shelley's version of the Neoplatonic ladder, without first learning how to love a more immediate antitype of his internal prototype. The Poet, in sum, does project his needs onto nature. But this is only half the story. Shelley dramatizes an epistemological process which in volves both passive reception and active imaginative projection, and implies that imagination inevitably distorts what is perceived. In the Poet's case, his desire for the impossible solitude of a perfect union with nature leads him to distort his experiences and to create for himself a solitude much worse than the isolation of individual consciousness which can be mitigated by human love. III. The Purest Ministers of Nature: Testing the Vision Although many agree that Alastor criticizes the Poet's "self-centred se clusion" and irresponsibility toward other people, it is a commonplace that the second half of the poem, the Poet's journey, is little more than an overlong affirmation that nature contains no comprehensible com ment on the Poet's vision. This section, however, contains a largely unrecognized distinction between the Poet's pessimism and the narra tor's more complex view.14 In terms which echo the science of both Shelley's and our time, the narrator shows how humans can learn "enough" from nature to justify some qualified, probabilistic knowl edge. Ordinary perception of phenomenal nature can be used with 14- Heppner alone has noted that there is a difference between the narrator's commentary and the Poet's perspective in the last half of the poem (100-105). However, he describes this difference primarily as a perception of the Poet's moral error, not as a comment that nature is less inimical than the Poet thinks. Heppner implies that the narrator's view is more philosophically skeptical than the Poet's; the narrator denies the Poet's attempt to find an "escape" from the world, while the more skeptical narrator sees "the world [as] a 'phantasmal scene' [and] death [as] the total dissolution ofthat private inner world" (106).</page><page sequence="18">188 DONNA RICHARDSON visionary experiences as it is used with scientific hypotheses, to identify errors and tentatively affirm positive truths. True to the metaphors used by the narrator in his invocation, nature does not let the Poet participate directly and completely in its "loves and hatreds," but it does present analogies with his own being. These analogies suggest the animate, amorous qualities in all natural things and imply that he should interact accordingly with oth?r people. But though the scenes traversed by the Poet reinforce much of what he dreamt, he sees only what corresponds with his feelings and feels only the absence of what he most wanted. His example suggests that, while there may be no wedded union with nature, radical epistemological solitude is a condition the perceiver im poses on himself. Having rejected the people who "ministered" (255) to him and having implied that he, unlike the swan he sees, can find no mate on earth, the Poet passes out of the realm of any kindred animal or human spirits. He embarks seaward in a frail boat, assuming that the "genii" of waves and wind will be "ministers" to him by drowning him and conducting him "to the light / Of those beloved eyes" (304-7). His subsequent experience suggests, however, that even the lowest forms of nature contain mysterious processes that do not always follow predictable, determinate laws and that may sometimes minister benevolently to humans. The fate of the Poet and his boat suggests how far Shelley has come since his use of mechanistic, Holbachian metaphors to describe nature in Queen Mab. Whether the "eternal spring" of Necessity is to be taken as literal materialism or as metaphoric of a more immaterialist determinism in Queen Mab, Shelley's use of Holbach suggests he believes each atom in a whirlwind is fully determined and predictable. In Queen Mab's paraphrase of a passage from Holbach, although to a shipwrecked mariner the actions of wind and waves seem "unlinked contingency and chance, / No atom of this turbulence fulfils / A vague and unnecessitated task, / Or acts but as it must and ought to act" (vi. 165-73). Shelley never ceases to affirm that the individual "self" is "an atom to a universe" (Defence 474). But in Alastor the narrator uses turbulence to refute rather than to support Holbach. In an intriguing anticipation of recent chaos theory,15 turbulence affects one human atom in a more conditional, less destructive way. 15- Despite many misapprehensions about the scientific study of complex systems ("chaos theory"), this study emphasizes not chaos but forms of order in nonlinear systems once thought to be merely random. N. Katherine Hayles, in Chaos Bound: Orderly Disorder in Contemporary Literature and Science (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1990) 9-10, points out that the two branches in this field emphasize "the spontaneous emergence of order out of chaos"</page><page sequence="19">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 189 First, the leaky boat, which has been identified with the frailty of the Poet (301-3), "safely fled" the tempest, "as if that frail and wasted human form / Had been an elemental god" (349-51). At the base of the Caucasus mountains, the waters of the Caspian Sea16 then reverse the normal progress of a stream into the sea, the archetypal symbol of the entropie course of individual life which Shelley uses frequently throughout his work. On a rugged, volcanic coastline, the sea flows through a cavern into a whirlpool, the waters of which then plummet over rocks to the base of the mountains like some marine waterfall. The Poet's boat is caught in the whirlpool, which rises higher and higher, at every moment threatening to capsize the boat or send it shooting downward into the abyss. But although the "reverting stress" which runs counter to the whirlpool's "ascending stream" may ultimately be "resistless," the boat will not fall "now" (395-97). Shelley considers the Poet's predicament and the mathematically nonlinear patterns of order, such as strange attractors, existing within apparently random systems. The latter branch in particular has studied phenomena which contain patterns too complex for complete predictability, and in which causes are not equal in magnitude to effects?phenomena such as water and wind turbulence in which "a wandering breeze" can disrupt the apparently determined activity of an object caught in a whirlpool. Surprising as it may seem, part of Shelley's own paradigm shift between Queen Mab and Alastor seems to have included a similar recognition, not that nature lacks significant knowable order or Necessity, but that Necessity involves natural order too complex to be fully determinate and predictable. His conclusions as well as his examples imply, as does chaos theory, that "nature, too complex to fit into the Procrustean bed of linear dynamics, can renew itself precisely because it is rich in disorder and surprise" (Hayles n). And, as noted below, Shelley may also have anticipated nonlinear dynamics in suggesting, with surprisingly similar examples, that there is less merely destructive, positivistic determinism in the interaction of living beings than is asserted in more me chanistic scientific models. 16. This reverse-river journey "beyond all human speed" (361) through the cavern is a bending but not necessarily a breaking of natural law. There seems to be some critical debate about whether the Poet's boat embarks in realistic fashion, sailing westward on the Caspian sea and fetching up in the Caucasus Mountains between the Caspian and the Black Seas, or whether the boat sails east on the Aral Sea and thence on a supernatural journey up the Amu Darya river back to the Indian Caucasus (see particularly Poetry and Prose 76 n. 8, and Cameron 610-11 n. 10). One is inclined to agree with Cameron since, as he says, the Poet can see the mountains from the sea before entering the stream flowing through the cavern, and the Indian Caucasus is at least five hundred miles from the Aral Sea?suggesting in sum that the journey through the cavern is a realistic rather than a supernatural one. Moreover, the description of the journey through the cavern to the base of the mountains, where the water forms a whirlpool before cascading downward over some rocks to the base of the cliff, is a realistic description of how a sea may act particularly around a rocky, volcanically-formed coast. Since it is midnight when the Poet first sees the mountains and daylight when his boat emerges from the cave, one can ascribe about six hours to his voyage through the cavern.</page><page sequence="20">190 DONNA RICHARDSON in a series of rhetorical questions which imply that although death may ultimately be "resistless" like the fall of the water, there is also an "ascending" process countering entropy which makes the time and place of death uncertain (he asks of the boat, "Now shall it fall?"). At this moment, instead of drowning him, nature sends a breeze which pushes the boat onto a bank above the whirlpool and deposits him in an Edenic grove which provides as much instruction in the mystery and majesty of earth as possible. Besides being unpredictably benevolent, the nature through which the Poet journeys also refutes his claim that it is "deaf" and "blind" to his thoughts. On the contrary, there are repeated intimations that he is ignoring evidence for his dream rather than failing to find any. The grove into which he sails recapitulates all the elements of his dream except the unifying form of a "veiled maid." The "Spirit" which "seemed to stand by him" represents neither the appropriate object of his vision nor his false interpretation of that object. It is the sum of the phenomenal appearances around him rather than either anything human or a visionary object with a veil "borrowed" from nature (479-88). Yet the appearances around him affirm a great deal of his vision. The scene is a network of intertwined plants "wedded," "embracing," and loving in the manner of mother and child (433, 440-45). Like the female form of his dream, the Darwinian loves of the plants imply all things in nature, including the Poet, find the greatest satisfaction by seeking others of their kind. The synaesthetic "weaving" of sensations which cornprised the Poet's dream is present in the grove and similarly implies that there is some harmonious unity, some beautiful but inaccessible mystery, underlying their diversity. The "darkest glen" which sends forth "a soul dissolving odor, to invite / To some more lovely mystery" (451-53) further intimates that there is a lovelier mystery informing nature and partially revealed by phenomenal appearances. Unlike his model Erasmus Darwin, Shelley stops short of attributing qualities of human mind to the plants and tentatively compares general processes rather than individual behaviors in making his natural analo gies. Darwin's decorative "poetic" analogies are often too specific, ma terial, and anthropomorphic to apply to more than a few decorative and arbitrary points of relationship (typical is his description of female Val lisneria flowers as "admiring" the males, "love-sick," sighing vows to Venus, and clasping their lovers "in their arms"17). Even his more serious "philosophical" analogies are typical of eighteenth-century science in 17- Erasmus Darwin, The Temple of Nature (London, 1803) 11: 280-86.</page><page sequence="21">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 191 overgeneralizing from a few likenesses to hypotheses such as the essential similarity of plants and animals. Yet analogies are as fundamental to scientific theories as to other metaphysical conceptions of the universe.18 Shelley has evidently learned from the problems in Darwin's analogies (as well as from Queen Mab, where he thought mechanistic models were adequate metaphors for the operations of Nature's Spirit), and he is careful to make his analogies more tentative as well as less inappro priately anthropomorphic. The "embrace" of oaks and beeches (431-32) is a more gradual but equally deadly form of the competitive forest succession described at the beginning of Canto v in Queen Mab, as is the entwining of parasitic vines around the trees' "wedded boughs" (444-45). Yet the analogy with humans is all the more realistic for representing positive and negative. Children and creepers are parasitic upon parents as well as "gamesome" and "innocent," and imperfect human marriages (as Shelley well knew) contain tensions of mutual support and competition similar to those in a climax forest. The grove implies that such support can produce positive, if never permanent, instances of beauty and harmony in nature.19 But the Poet is unable to see any evidence which contradicts his feeling that if there is no perfect spousal union with nature there is no mean ingful relation at all. In each experience he reads only his own superiority 18. Philip C. Ritterbush, in Overtures to Biology (New Haven: Yale UP, 1964) traces the major problems with excessive "speculation" in eighteenth-century biology, particularly its enthusiasm for overly-sweeping analogies. Ritterbush, however, seems to imply that science managed to free itself substantially from the errors of analogy, which were part of the fallacious quest for hypotheses which offered "total explanation"; the nineteenth century saw a "revolution in technique" which made biology a "positivistic science em ploying experiment and more modest programs of observation according to the principle of limited explanation" (156-57). He makes only passing reference to Thomas Kuhn's then-recent Structure of Scientific Revolutions, a work which implies that all science has been based upon paradigms which make global claims whatever the conservatism of their methods, and that analogy is essential to the articulation of all paradigms, including positivism. 19. Shelley's descriptions of succession and evolution are both pre- and post-Darwinian (Charles) in suggesting that cooperation is as essential to biological systems as competition. See, for example, 158 and following in John Briggs and F. David Peat, Turbulent Mirror: An Illustrated Guide to Chaos Theory and the Science of Wholeness (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1989). Even some of the language and categories describing species cooperation in this book are eerily Shelleyan ("where species occur naturally, they appear woven into their environment in such a way that they regulate their own population numbers," 158? emphasis added; Charles Darwin's negative model of ruthless competition is an "anthro pomorphized" and "[circular] nature-is-like-man-therefore-man-is-like-nature analogy" less applicable to animal behavior than to "human aggression," which "unlike animal aggression" is "almost always based on ego," I59n).</page><page sequence="22">192 DONNA RICHARDSON to all else in nature and the limits nature places upon his desires. This inability to see nature's positive and mysterious qualities is most evident in those few instances where he addresses nature (he speaks only thrice in the poem, twice to compare himself with phenomena). Unlike the more dialogic narrator, the Poet does not make requests, use impersonal analogies recognizing both positive and negative processes in nature, or show any humility before nature's mysteries. On the contrary, he im poses purely personal analogies, and only when they affirm his precon ceived beliefs. Directly addressing the problem raised by eighteenth century science of how far to carry natural analogies such as Darwin's, Shelley suggests how such analogies can be either the means to some conditional knowledge or the vehicle of self-imposed alienation from nature.20 When the Poet sees a swan flying out to sea, he makes a quintessen tially egocentric and contradictory interpretation of its meaning. He assumes the swan is seeking its mate and identifies with this impulse, since subsequently he feels "a restless impulse" to seek his visionary maid by drowning. But he does not follow the logic of his own im pulsive identification and seek a natural mate as he presumes the swan does. Instead, he claims he is superior to all things in nature such as the swan, and thinks he is deserving of something more than such a mate: And who am I that I should linger here, With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes, Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned To beauty, wasting these surpassing powers In the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven That echoes not my thoughts? (285-91) 20. Metaphor is, indeed, the model for discriminating among scientific representations according to at least one realist but anti-positivist version of chaos theory: Observations, then, are culturally conditioned and anthropomorphically determined. Thus we can never know how our representations mesh with reality, for we can never achieve a standpoint outside them. Nevertheless, within the range of repre sentations available at a given time, we can ask, "Is this representation consistent with the aspects of reality under interrogation?" If the answer is affirmative, we still only know our representations, not reality itself. But if it is negative, we know that the representation does not mesh with reality in a way that is meaningful to us in that context. The difference between a representation that is consistent with reality and one that depicts reality is the difference between a metaphor and a description. In this sense all theories are metaphoric. . . . (Hayles 223)</page><page sequence="23">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 193 Exhibiting a classic anthropocentric fallacy, the Poet assumes the swan is perfectly content in an unconscious oneness with nature (how does he know it has a mate? or what it thinks?) whereas humans are distin guished by a superior, tragic self-awareness of mortality?yet the bird's searching flight has motivated him to comment on this human dissat isfaction. With further irony, considering he has just sympathized and made analogies with something in nature, the Poet claims nature in general "echoes not" his "thoughts." As his own words inadvertently imply, it is he who is "wasting" his powers by failing to sympathize more fully and consistently with what nature gives him, not an empty nature which denies him meaning. His attitude is unlike that of the later Shelley, who says of the skylark, "What thou art, we know not" and asks to be taught "half the gladness" of a song whose "joy we never shall come near." The Poet's second analogy, between himself and the stream flowing from the well in the grove, is slightly less alienated; having been swept into the beautiful grove rather than drowned, he perhaps no longer assumes nothing in nature bears any analogy to his condition. But he still sees and sympathizes only with that which echoes his own sense of superiority and of nature's limits upon him. Emotionally, his "strong impulse" of solitude (445) makes him unable to "deck ... his withered hair" (413) with flowers, Maenad-like. Since he is not directly feeling them, he has little sympathy with the loves of other beings around him; spring's voluptuous pantings may be dear to the narrator but not to him. Cognitively, of all the suggestive intimations in the grove, he notices only two?the self-absorbed narcissi, with whose blooms he "longed to deck his hair," and the well which merely reflects all that passes over it. Indeed, the "two eyes" in the well he takes to be the veiled maid's (490) are really his own, as signalled by the narrator's previous comparison of the Poet's seeing his own eyes in the well to the anthropomorphic mistake of conceiving a god and an afterlife similar to this life (469-74). He doesn't even take the "inaccessibly profound" source of the well literally as an example of nature's deep mysteries. He only sees it as a metaphor for the superiority of his own spirit to anything phenomenal, and for the uncertainty of his fate when death disperses his physical being. Having identified the stream as the only thing in nature which sig nificantly reflects his own condition, he follows the stream to its and his own point of dispersion in an act which could be taken literally or symbolically. Either way, he identifies with a landscape which ages unnaturally and prematurely, like his hair?a sign that his choice creates more rapid and complete destruction than any limitation imposed by nature. Literally, he identifies with the unnaturally swift aging of the</page><page sequence="24">194 DONNA RICHARDSON landscape around the stream as if flows to the cliff edge, and he wills himself to die at the place where the stream falls over the cliff. More symbolically, he is like many romantic heroes who see themselves as superior to nature. In such diverse guises as Manfred and Bartleby, these heroes "prefer not" to take part in the uncontrollable complexities of life, opting instead to live an isolate existence in negative defiance of the only certainties nature offers?limitation and mortality. Their attitude is self-fulfilling; it makes their lives empty and their deaths premature. The Poet even fails to recognize the points of correspondence in the analogy he himself has made. The stream neither simply becomes dis persed nor meets with some wondrous wedded union as it meets its end. The stream eventually disappears over a cliff from which a sunset scene is visible, "islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams, / Dim tracts and vast" (555-56). Nature extends to the Poet a sublime and harmonious panorama, much like the sunset scene in Queen Mab that causes "thy fancy" figuratively to soar above the earth and literally to believe there is a Spirit of Nature (11.19). If the Poet is going to identify his life with the stream, he might then entertain the prospect (so to speak) that the human spirit returns to a harmonious whole. But the "near scene" which the Poet chooses as his deathbed is apart from the harmony of the big picture. This scene "In naked and severe simplicity / Made contrast with the universe" (559-61). The solitary Aeolian pine beside the cave "to each inconstant blast / Yield[s] one only response" (563-64), like the Poet who can make only a single, "pining" response to nature. The monotoned pine, the rapid "aging" of the scenery, and the dead leaves filling the Poet's cave recall the "autumnal dirges" played by the prematurely gray Aeolian hair of the Poet. The Poet has literally made his bed and chosen to lie in it. Alastor does indeed analyze, as its preface says, "one of the most inter esting situations of the human mind, " because the problem of solitude in all its facets is the problem of the self and its relation to the world. Recent criticism has made a significant step in revealing that Shelley was one of the first to question thoroughly the permanence of any ordering conceptions the mind projects. But such questioning does not necessarily entail a radical form of skeptical idealism. Alastor suggests that the human rage to fix on apparently absolute truths is less the result of a known absence of any order in nature than of our inability to mediate the conflict between the ego and the order that does appear to exist. Seeking what initially seems the ultimate in altruistic ideals, the Poet illustrates how the moral and cognitive limitations of egocentrism are inextricable from the most generous of human conceptions. Even more</page><page sequence="25">RADICAL SKEPTICISM IN ALASTOR 195 insidiously, the more powerfully sympathetic the imagination, the greater the danger that it will seek to exceed its own limits, become unable to accept them, and end by aggravating them. Those who insist on the unambiguous certainty and goodness of any idea, especially metaphysical ones, risk worshipping the selfish along with?or instead of?the altruistic elements in such an idea. By insisting on the superiority of his vision to the possibility of a mortal mate, the Poet idolizes the egocentric and impossible rather than the altruistic and feasible impli cations of his experiences. Out of the best possible motives, he inflicts a solitude on himself and others greater than any his natural condition alone would have imposed. As the narrator says in first speaking of the Poet, "he lived, he died, he sung in solitude"; he was an unmourned and unproductive poet who communicated only pining and wasting to those unfortunate enough to cross his path. But as the narrator also says at the very end, we must avoid shedding any further tears?not only because the inaccessibility of a wedded union and the "unheeded tribute of a broken heart" (624) in search of it is a woe too deep for them, but also because in mourning we replicate rather than learn from the Poet's error. Emotionally, it is all too easy to become an "alas!"tor, like the Poet who thinks "alas!" twice when his vision disappears and he interprets this disappearance as an unmitigated calam ity (207), and like the narrator, very close to his material, who near the end includes, but does not conclude with, one "alas!" (698). The only way to mitigate the solitude of self is to seek the good dispersed through out nature and to test the feasibility and altruism of one's conceptions about this good against subsequent experience.
