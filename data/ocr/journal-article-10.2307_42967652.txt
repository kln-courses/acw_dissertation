<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liquid Fairy: The Nineteenth-Century Fairy and Cultural Anxieties Rosemary Mitchell Fames in Nineteenth- Century Art and Literature by Nicola Bown. Cambridge University Press, 2001. £40. ISBN 0-521-79315-7 'Fear, ANXIETY, DOUBT AND PESSIMISM cannot be magicked away... but they can be given an enchanted form' (p. 1), claims Nicola Bown in her study of the nineteenth-century fairy as a cultural site for the exploration of middle- class neuroses provoked by industrialisation and modernity. Her book is adapted from her thesis, and although scholarly in approach, it is more readable than many such publications and should appeal to the general reader with an interest in fairies. Bown has a good story to tell, one which shows how the fairy became Proteus, shifting shape to reflect a range of responses and reactions to the circumstances of the Brave New World: a liquid fairy, no less. Bown traces the origin of the Victorian obsession with fairies in the Romantic reaction to the 'deadening rationalism' of the Enlightenment. Early nineteenth-century enthusiasts such as Thomas Keightley saw fairies as the folklore survivals of ancient deities, or supernatural explanations for natural phenomena in a pre-scientific age. Her first chapter, though, is primarily about gender: while men turned to the fairy for a Romantic relief from rationalism, she argues, women were rejecting her as the embodiment of an image of femininity which they wished to escape. She explores this gender divide through an examination of the responses of the Romantic artist Henry Fuseli's Titania and Bottom , which views the story as a pessimistic figuring of human destiny, in which the masculine virtues of rationality and order are eroded by the feminine and fairy-like vices of sensuality and debauchery. Bottom, exhibiting a Michelangelo-esque physique, represents the classical until Titania turns him into a donkey. Bown links this to late eighteenth-century concerns about the power of 'fancy' to overthrow reason, which she illustrates in the works of early feminists such as Wollstonecraft and Mary Hays. In chapter 2 the fairy represents other anxieties. Bown argues that the advent of industrialisation and scientific and technological advances eroded a traditional sense of scale and proportion, and that the miniaturised figure of the fairy reflected this disorientation. She demonstrates effectively how the fairy was used to attempt to stabilise scale in the age of the balloon and © The Editors, The Cambridge Quarterly, Vol. 33, No. 1 2004.

Here, Bown suggests, the figure of the demon Kuhleborn is represented as massive, while attendant fairies are perfect miniature humans, thus nor- malising the proportions of the central human figures. Equally well, she demonstrates how the fairy painting was used to destabilise scale: an analysis of Richard Dadd's Come unto these Yellow Sands (1842) shows how the shell in the foreground makes a nonsense of the size of the arch of the rock in the background. In chapter 3 Bown considers the fairy and the natural sciences, analysing how many Victorians regretted the pre-modern fairylands disenchanted by the advance of scientific knowledge. She makes telling use of the complaints in Edmund Gosse's Father and Son (1907) about the destruction of the magic of the rock pool by the botanical investigator and collector. But, she argues, the language of the fairy was used to register the magic as well as lament the advance of scientific knowledge. The geologist Hugh Miller, for instance, in The Old Red Sandstone (1841), chose to include footnotes recounting fairy legends, thus restoring the supernatural to his strata even before he turned scriptural geologist, reconciling Genesis with the evidence of geology. But Bown's best work here is in her analysis of the use of the fairy in works of popular science aimed at women and children and the works of fairy paint- ers such as John Anster Fitzgerald. She demonstrates that popular scientific works often resorted to the metaphor of the fairy to gloss over the uncom- fortable truth that nature - the work of God for the devout Christian - was 'red in tooth and claw'. She links this perceptively to such works by Fitzgerald as Cock Robin Defending his Nest , where fairies in medieval dress engage in the courtly pastime of hunting, thus disguising both sentimentally and nostalgically the struggle of nature. Nevertheless, she argues, the disguise is not an entirely successful one, as the companion piece, Who killed Cock Robin?, showed. Here Bown ventures to introduce some of her most unusual pieces of evidence - the anthropomorphic taxidermies of Walter Potter, which - although they certainly do not contain fairies - do suggest the same sort of dis-ease as Fitzgerald's works. Bown's pièce de résistance , though, is an analysis of Richard Dadd's enig- matic painting The Fairy Feller's Master-Stroke (1855-64). Traditionally, this masterpiece has been seen in terms of his mental condition, as a possible reflection of schizophrenia, but Bown interprets it as 'at least partially culturally determined' (p. 155) - and she is surely right to do so. It is, she believes, an extreme response to the Victorian scientific revolution and the concurrent crisis of faith: a sterile and supernaturalised version of the 'entangled bank' in the last paragraph of Darwin's On the Origin of Species. Unable either to accept the Paleyite metaphysical reading of the natural</page><page sequence="3">LIQUID FAIRY 65 world or to face the materialistic universe of Darwin, Dadd resorted to the construction of a world peopled with fairies who neither relate to or repro- duce with each other; a world in which the symbol of fertility - a nut - is eternally on the point of destruction; a world of stasis. Whether or not one agrees with this reading, Bown's attempt to relate the works produced by Dadd during the period of his mental instability to his cultural context is a particularly welcome one. Bown's final chapter explores turn-of-the-century use of fairies, when the fairy had become a figure of nostalgia for the adult audience. She points to the increasing number of poems preoccupied with the departure of the fairies, such as R. M. Watson's 'The Fairies' Valediction' of 1889, and fairy plays, in which only children were able to see the fairies. In these cultural artefacts, she argues, fairyland stood for a lost golden age, either a pre-modern period or childhood - or the former represented as the latter. She analyses the telling moment in J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan (1904), when the children in the audience are exhorted to signal their belief in fairies by clapping, thus saving the dying Tinkerbell. For Bown, the fading fairy is symbolised by his or her appearance as a solitary figure in turn-of-the-century art, as in H.J. Draper's The Kelpie (1913), or by their representation as transparent, evanescent wisps of smoke, as in Estella Canziana's The Piper of Dreams (1914), popular with the soldiers in the trenches for its nostalgic and escapist vision of Blighty. The centrepiece of the chapter, somewhat predictably, is an analysis of the Cottingley fairies episode, in which faked photographs of fairies were published in the Strand in 1920-1, through the agency of Arthur Conan Doyle. Bown disputes the usual readings of the aifair as an attempt to prove the existence of fairies or an attempt to document a dying species: for the girls involved, she argues, the project was not to record fairies seen by girls, but girls who imagine fairies - whatever the adult participants believed. The debate provoked by the publication of the photographs served, Bown argues, to kill off the final fleeting adult interest in and fascination with the fairy. As Bown herself indicates, there is much relatively unexplored ground here. There is, for instance, little on the links between interest in fairies and British nationalisms, even at a time when the issue of national identities is high on the agenda for the British historian. This is perhaps a particularly disappointing omission: Noel Paton's Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania and The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania can be read, as Richard Schindler suggested, as an attempt to make fantasy painting into history painting and to engage with issues of national identity and audiences. Bown's study is also presented explicitly as an examination of the significance of the fairy for an adult audience: the development of the fairy tale, for instance, is not a subject for discussion. This means that the entertaining controversy of Dickens's</page><page sequence="4">66 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY entertaining attack on the temperance crusader George Cruikshank's efforts to turn the fairy tale into a moral tract goes unmentioned - and, indeed, anyone who has attempted to read the fantasy novels of George MacDonald might well question the assumption that the fairy tale was either intended for or only read by children. Equally, there is also no attempt to consider the working-class perception of the fairy, a subject which Bown believes has been amply considered by Diane Purkiss. However, authors rightly curse reviewers who criticise them for not writing the books they have consciously and explicitly avoided writing, and these self-imposed limitations are all sensible in the light of the potentially vast subject area. There are, however, other areas where the historian of middle-class culture might have hoped for a more comprehensive analysis: there is clearly space for a far more extended consideration of the role of the fairy in the definition of Victorian gender roles. Bown's analysis of the representation of the fairy as a symbol of female irrationality and sensuality in the Romantic period could have been followed by a study of the manifestations of the fairy in the later Victorian age of the 'New Women': did the representation of the fairy reflect angst about modernity in the form of the new roles and ambitions of the middle-class woman? There is a growing interest in the Victorian fairy and issues of sexuality which could have been reflected in this study. There are also some omissions in terms of source materials: there is, for instance, very little coverage of book illustra- tions, apart from the images featured in botanical and natural history pub- lications. However, this book remains a significant and scholarly contribution to our understanding of the Victorian attempt to comprehend and cope with the impact of modernity, as well as an important addition to the scholarly literature on the subject of fairies.</page></plain_text>
