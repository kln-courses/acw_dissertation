The Spectacle Shall I be of any use to you in the discovery of that which shines as promise beams? How can we advance, touch with our eyes that which moves, a dose of light in concentrated darkness, these pale threads or grains, shadowy shafts of light, occasionally constrained by color, in a dim presence which, by its very foundation, enchants as attention wanes: a presence that receives the projected: as an obstacle as well as a spectacle? How can we speak otherwise of this cinema, come from else- where, Arab and multiple, to be impressed upon then erased from the memory of a Parisian screen for a month's duration? 2. Misrecognition So that the word is received truly different in this very space though present circumstances are eager and duty-bound to rec- ognize any exacerbated identity; so that thought avoid the som- nolence, the apparently comfortable bed offered in hospitality; so that vigilance fuse us to rigor; so that we may finally choose our own intoxication; it goes without saying that the strategy of difference, which weaves its web over that which pleases out of misrecognition , deserves to be unveiled, were it only to preserve the disparity permitting the irreducible, the irreconcilable to remain brilliant, out of reach: there lies our raison d 'être. 3. The Mark For the circuit of alliances responds and amplifies words which play on their objective differences to confirm the similar, the dis- tinct: what a relief to discover that what is proposed as non-seen, as other is eventually subjected to an already-seen, an already-known. The exchange is thus instituted, and its products circulate according to a technique of deliverance that foregrounds the mark distin- guishing them and guaranteeing familiarity to the gaze in search of disorientation. 4. The Take And the result is all the more startling when the support con- veying it stems from cinema. In other realms of expression, such a task might well perish in the system of its very difficulty. Thus it is with painting, which problematizes the question of the take and of its represented density in relation to the real. While in</page><page sequence="3">16 Discourse 21.1 cinema, the take of the real (we say: film take) does not need to be conquered, is not determined by an elusive skill; it is obtained at the very moment of doing; the real reflected there is manipulated and possessed from the outset: and it is not rare to discover a beautiful shot as indifference passes, a shot moving in itself, to be detached from a work restricted in all mediocrity to seeking refuge in the conspicuousness of a doxa! 5. Exile Cinema, as the technique of an era, inevitably acts on an iden- tical deployed in the space of a difference. And it is in that place that we play the epigraph by Goethe against the truth of that by Flaubert. Here we put forth what we gain in irreducible through language in the assault on the standardizing potentialities of the machine. If only through the effect of scenery and language, and in an immediate way, such a difference progresses according to the graces of its echoes. That which obstructs an immediate given are the series of actions which program the manipulation so that legibility be standardized. And the work, like the eye, conscious of such an implication, is that which is thought, fabricated, shown on the very site of our speech: that of exile. The exile deepens the gaze on its origin as much as it limits by the ambition that incessantly fabulates its I. Projects are pushed upon these limits, realized, then lost. And as soon as the work is invested by the father, as soon as the signature protrudes, as soon as the representativity is intensely required, the work moves on both in the desert of eyes, unbearable, invisible to the very ones who are filmed, who present themselves as matter and subject, yet also acts on the marginal fringe of those seeking salvation or delight or power in a domain that itches them in its strangeness. II. The Instance of the Imaginary 6. The Double Pitfall Still it is worthwhile to question cinema from the point of view of the Arabic esthetic tradition. We know that in this tradition, the problem of the image continues to be the specter haunting the scene of representation. In order to avoid superficial, conventional considerations declaring that Islamic law would not tolerate the sight of the image and that the latter only gave rise to an activ- ity that was late, marginal, condemned, hunted, reduced to the</page><page sequence="4">Winter 1 999 1 7 illumination; to escape the ricochet response to such an affirmation which strives to show, with myriad pieces of evidence and exhibits, that the Arabo-Islamic iconoclasm was one of the most relative and that as early as the Omayyad era the image occupied the monumen- tal space of painting and that we are right to discover great masters in the art of the figure drawn and painted in miniature (Master of Leningrad,1 Wâsitï, etc.); in order to remove the problematic of the image from this inefficient alternative, we would do well to seek elsewhere the terms which return to the question the dimensions of its complexity as well as the key to its resolution. 7. The Path Such a displacement requires cardinal extrapolations which, frankly, go beyond the scope of this text. That being the case, we shall have to be satisfied with the premises of such an investigation, to discover in the immensely rich reading of Sufi literature, which has thought and worked so ardently on the edges, where form, vision, dream, the degrees and levels of the individual that hierar- chisize experience, come into play, succintly put, a common space in which the image is drawn out either in its entirety or in shreds. 8. Hadrat al-Khayãl At the outset of such a reflection emerges the key concept of Hadrat al-Khayãl (that Titus Burckhardt [Sagesse], like Corbin, translates as Imaginative presence, but that I translate, to insist on the passive, exterior form of such an event as Presencing the Imagination, a concept that allows us by pushing it out of a transaction to entitle this effort the instance of the imaginary, meaning the place of representa- tion, of figuration, the receptacle of the form, of the image: Hadrat al-Khayãl wa Ч-Mithãl) . This is a concept to be situated in its origins, which is the summa of Muhyï al-Dïn ibn al-' Arabi, Fusils al-Hikam, in particular the chapter devoted to the "The Wisdom of Light in the Word of Joseph" (Ibn al-' Arabi, Sagesse 107-119; Fusils 99-106) and which I shall outline here from memory. 9. Anecdote 1 Hadrat al-Khayãl, that welcomes the true vision, that announces inspiration: the dazzling, vigorous, imminent and inevitable inspi- ration depends on its clarity, its purity. So it was with the prophet Muhammad, his favorite wife 'Ä'isha reports: six months of dreams preceded the dictation of the text of the prophecy through the intermediary of the Angel.</page><page sequence="5">18 Discourse 21.1 However, the world of the imagination ( 'Ãlarn al-Khayãl) is sym- bolic: reality which is itself in one form appears in yet another. And through interpretation ( Ta'wïl) we can bring about a "transposition of the form perceived by the dreamer to the appropriate form of the implied reality- supposing that it has been surmised." 10. Anecdote 2 Hadrat al-Khayãl can occur outside of sleep. A stranger arrives, questions the prophet: "Greet the man," the latter says; completely aware that he is being visited by the angel Gabriel, the prophet calls him by the name of the form he inhabits, the form he assumed in order to reveal himself. Then he says: "It's Gabriel": through interpretation, the second form is designated in the first; and the two names are correct. Ibn al-' Arabi adds: "The apparition is visually true and it was truly Gabriel." The first form takes on a perceptible truth, the second an actual truth. In this case, the name, the word designates the perceptible; through it the symbolic is unveiled; it describes the successive stages of the real. The word says the image. 11. Anecdote 3 This one justifies attributing the wisdom of light to Joseph, the master interpreter of dreams. Hadrat al-Khayãl is expressed in him through the dream which opens the sùra: "I have seen eleven stars and the sun and the moon and I have seen them bow down before me" (Qur'ân, XII, 4) . The interpretation is simple indeed: Joseph saw his brothers as stars, his father and step-mother as the sun and moon. It is a vision, Ibn al-'Arabï explains, typical of Joseph; it attracted only his own imagination; it presented itself only to him, unbeknownst to those concerned. This is a remark which corresponds to his general theory of the imagination (developed in another text), which is divided into two categories: an imagination attached to the individual and to him alone (Khayãl muttasil ), and a separate imagination, which can be drawn upon as a being continues on its path (Khayãl munfasil) . Joseph's narrative thus finishes in a Qur'anic way: "Here is the interpretation of my vision; my Lord has fulfilled it" (Qur'ân, XII, 100). That is, that "it appeared in the perceptible world after appearing in imaginative form." 12. The Second Dream But Ibn al-'Arabï criticizes the limits of the interpretations of ' A' isha- regarding what she reported- and of Joseph.</page><page sequence="6">Winter 1999 19 'A'isha does not know that we never leave our dreams, that the world is made of dreams, that the world of visions, of dreams, is but a dream within a dream ( Manãm fi manãm) . While Joseph believes his dream has been realized, he separates the vision and its concretization. Now, the imaginai world is a part of the perceptible world: it is the same world, translated, interpreted according to two different modes. "The imagination proposes only perceptible objects, nothing more." And we only leave the dream state on dying, which is an awakening. 13. The Shadow of God The world is to God what the shadow is to man; the world is the shadow of God. For there to be a shadow, there must be a support upon which light is projected. The perception of shadow is produced through light. "Light is being ( Wujüd )." 14. Intermediary How can you see red and green and pink before seeing light? If not your spirit would wander aimlessly through colors becoming veils hiding the light. When such colors disappear in darkness you will know that seeing colors depends on light. (Rùmï, Kafafì 1:1121-23) 15. The One and the Multiple If the world is the shadow of God, all is in him: all is reduced to one, though its forms may vary. The world is one in that it is God; it is multiple in that it is the world. The shadow of the one appears in the multiple: the world also concerns the imagination; and the imagination englobes the whole world. But the world of the imagination ( 'Alam al-Khayãl) is real in itself. "Truth (God, al-Haqq) in relation to a given shadow, small or large, pure or not, is like light in relation to the glass which protects it: it is colored by its color though in itself it is colorless." Thus it is with all things in relation to divine reality. "If you say: light is green like green glass, you speak the truth and you bear witness through the perceptible; if you say: light is not green, it is colorless, you speak the truth and you bear witness through proper reasoning." "The being is imagination within imagination ( Khayãl fi Kha- yãl)." In existence ( Kawn ), everything designates unity, while the</page><page sequence="7">20 Discourse 21.1 imagination serves to speak the multiple. And the name, the word is multiplied to call the one, it is endlessly combined in the imaginary, it dies in creation. III. The Image and the Letter 1 6. The Feminine Completes the Androgyne What is expressed when the space/ time that is the imagination presents itself to us? How can we translate the visions created there? Is the letter alone to manifest the image? And why would the image not attach itself as an icon to some support, the projection of its mental presence? The appearance of imagined form is hindered by the existence of perfect form in woman, the source and receptacle of creation, the encounter in which the face of God is consumed in adoration by the intense sensual pleasure of coitus, by an act of nuptial annihilation ( nikãh ). In Ibn al-4 Arabi (. Fusils 214-220; Sagesse 196-206) inter- preting one of the Prophet's words, woman, through her presence, assures the very principal of creation. Keeper of the greater part of the enigma, she organizes the dual passive /ас tive contribution (Munfa'il/Fä'il) which allows us to admire the presence of the one. Meanwhile the masculine assumes only a passive position (Ibn al- ' Arabi, Fusús 217; Sagesse 201) .2 In this new division the myth of the androgyne comes to an end: for the power of the gathered para- dox (active/passive) is attributed to the eternal feminine (Corbin, L 5 imagination créatrice 121). Woman is not merely an object of desire she is the light of God Say: she is creative or say: she is not a creature. (RùmI, Istillami I: 2448) 1 7. The Light of the Eye The love of woman helps the individual to cross the successive stages transposing him from one world to another, for she is the true figure (real/imagined). The plasticity of the vision is materialized in her, and nothing should disturb the concentration she suggests. Our own ascension is projected from her, from her appearance, toward that which she arouses in the occult, while the manifest image would have</page><page sequence="8">Winter 1999 21 fallen short of the mystery of the plastic and mental vision of God. The image, if it shows itself (imagination in imagination), can only constitute a regression in the hierarchy of lights, falling from the light of the heart to the light of the eye: "Know that the light of the gaze is characterized by its shortcomings: the eye sees the other yet it does not see itself; likewise, it does not see that which moves away from it, nor that which is behind a veil. It sees only the apparent side of things, never the hidden; it sees only a part of what is. It sees finite bodies, but not the infinite. It errs endlessly in viewing: it sees the large as small, the far as near, the immobile as mobile, the mobile as immobile. These seven shortcomings remain always with the apparent eye . . ." (Ghazãll 43). The light (the eye) of the heart can make up for each of these shortcomings, overcoming such obstacles: "The eye is light in relation to other objects, but it is darkness compared to the heart. . . . The eye is a mine of colors and forms conveying information to the heart" (Ghazãll 46). 1 8. The Letter Interprets the Image Had the image become manifest through painting, the subtle process of the vision would have disappeared, and this would have created another level of representation in the hierarchy of imagina- tions, a degree to which it would have been conceivable to create the keys of its interpretation to go from multiple to multiple to the one, from imagination to imagination to Reality, from shadow to shadow to light. An existence which, without favoring the complexity of the ascent, would have simply slowed it, hindered it. That would have opened an accidental, non-essential ceremony, which has existed as such in painting. The renewal of creation, which is not the repetition of the identical, which is not assimilation, but resemblance, simulacra (ruled by the famous "as if" - Kaannahu - of Balqïs, Qur'ân, XXVII, 42; a saying of the Prophet: "Worship God as if you see Him."), is sufficient for the imagined but not represented image, for a strictly mental plasticity which is expressed in the word, in the science of the interpretation that it founds (ta'wü). "I saw my Lord in a form of the greatest beauty, like a youth with flowing hair, seated on the throne of grace; He wore a robe of gold (or green) ; a gold mitre on His head; gold sandals on His feet" ( Hadïth ar-Ru'ya, qtd. Corbin 203). It is a fabulous vision, visio smaragdina, reported by the word. Like so many other visions or Qur'anic images (such as the sleepers in the cave, their dog at the opening: "You would have seen them awake though they slept." Qur'ân, XVIII, 18) where the word/ sign,</page><page sequence="9">22 Discourse 21.1 premiss if not of the image, then at least of the representation, returns after so many stories, in which each verse is called a sign ( aya ), thus prompting its enrichment through gesture and voice (calligraphy, psalmody). Like so many other clarifying, reviving images in Sufi texts. The word, the name which rules over the multiple suffices through its degree of abstraction, as a trace- which implies a jour- ney, a passage - to testify for the vision: in it is fixed the form, the apparition body in which the perfect image is created and radiated. Form was born of the verb, then died thus does the wave return to the sea Form emerged from the formless then returned to where we must all return. (Rùmï I, Isti'lami: 1148-49) 1 9. The Calligraphy of the Visionary The emphasis on the image in Ibn al-'Arabi's metaphysics, the apex of Sufi theorization, is so renowned, so fundamental that it sets his text apart from what can appear as "pantheistic monism," as a reference to neo-Platonism, or as a resemblance to certain accents close to those of Western mystics (in this case Master Eckart: Such Was Sister Katreß) , for he calls for an intimacy with God in a clearly personalized form, particularly recognizable in its burning desire ( Shawq ) for woman. The non-manifestation, the iconic non-realization of the image does not thus imply its absence, nor its submission to prohibition. The iconoclasm is only an appearance ( zähir ). The image is still present but hidden ( bãtin ). It is inserted, then erased and born again on the whims of the mirror of the heart. But the visionary ability may manifest itself, beyond the tran- scription by the word, in the spell of the letter. Ibn al-' Arabi himself visualizes divine Ipseity, the huwiyya , in the form of the Arabic letter hã' "dazzling with light, as if set on a red carpet; between the two branches of the hã' the letters h and w shine forth ( huwa , Him) while the /¿«'projects its rays into the four spheres" (Corbin 175). The invitation to the opulence, the jubilation of the calligraphic gesture is already suggested by the enigmatic letters- perilous for meaning- which open many sùras, among them that of Joseph, which begins with the meditative declamation of the letters a , /, r (Aliß Lãm , Rã ') , spoken independently as an announcement of "the verses- the signs- of the bright book"! They are letters enlightened</page><page sequence="10">Winter 1999 23 by this inaccessible plus introduced as an enigma into creative femininity. The letter, magnified in its migration from the text to the monument, refers through reminiscence to an entire scenography. Such is the range of the verse-sign of light, so frequently repeated as a wall piece in mosques: Light upon light (Qur'än, XXIV, 35) . So read the letters giving rise to the image of the niche, the lamp, the glass, the shining star, the tree (the olive tree, no less) , oil, and fire, a play on these terms, with each word an image exuding letters through the interlaced or overlapping concentration of the sentence. Such is the intuitive understanding of the visual background illuminat- ing the verse-sign of the throne (al-Kurst, al- Arsh), reputed to be more prophylactic than the eye, than the seven seals of Solomon, protecting, through its illegible mazes, so many mihrabs in whose half-light the affirmative direction, the mental door opening on the space of the invisible is kept. The letter in its calligraphic expression is consequently sup- ported, haunted even, by the image that it sustains. The rest is merely rhetorical, an artisan's dexterity eager to break the levels of the expression (the hidden/the visible) to route the circuit of the letter back to anthropomorphic/zoomorphic complacency. Thus is the letter driven on by the analogy of the place it occupies with painting. But to declare, to attest that calligraphy is to Arabo-Muslims what painting is to Westerners (al-Masraf 29) is to say very little. The essential was to recreate the whole process that gives credence to such a declaration, and then to move on.4 Thus does thought draw to a close through the feverish evo- cation of Rúml's final resting place in Konya, where calligraphy as text invades the hangings, gilded mouldings, embroidered velvet, colors- red, black, green, gold letters- and light, whose fire burns the dazzled eye. There, calligraphy constitutes its own scenographic logic, a pure theatricality, the decor of the celebrated death, all signed by the master Muhammad al-Halabl. Thus the destiny of thought is perfected through the nostalgic memory of the gray-green plate ( Lawha ) - earth and olive tree - of which, child or adolescent writes the ephemeral, recollected sùra, the demonstration of the ability to learn ( Hifz ) in order to seek that which would complete the lesson, obole or offering for an obscure master of mnemotechny. The letter crosses the space limited like a line of ants surrounded by flowers or the architectural outline so as to measure itself by the fréquentation of the imagined, non- represented image. A short time passes, and the practice of people erases the letter, then reproduces it with a gesture which is perpetu- ated by the recommencement of a resemblant which differs; that's</page><page sequence="11">24 Discourse 21.1 where an art is acquired, a technique permitting the theory to be refined and spoken in the dazzle of the illumination. IV. Questions for the Narrative 20. Recapitulatory In this long, floating development which has led us, by way of a shortcut, to the discovery of the image's true place, our entry through the door of difference in the machinery of cinema- ap- paratus and circles, infrastructure and functioning- has been com- plicated. And if this segment of our itinerary has gravitated around the shadow of painting, the immobile, unmoving, wan, and mute projection of easily deciphered scenes, the horizon to come strays into the narrating verb, speech and words, exchange, dialogue, mise en scène, the brief narrative to be followed in its genesis and the evolution of its structures according to the place of its saying, to the support which diffuses it. A way of articulating the field of cinema with that which nourishes it by sending it down successful paths, back to that which betrays and takes upon itself, through the univocal and the unilogue, the mission of imposing by hegemony a culture with infinitely renewed but, for the lucid, easily neutralizable means: have you already guessed that this phantom which differs in name is called literature ? Through the double origin of the novelistic and the theatrical which attacks it, the cinema dies to itself, confined to the repetition of ideological dominance as long as it doesn't contribute by happy contamination to the undoing, indeed, the prompt breakdown of the law which gave birth to it. Taking apart the process and the machine: this is the little secret that opens us up to a fragmented future. 21. Qur'ânic Intermittence But before we examine the relationship between Arabic litera- ture and cinema- once that which occupies our century has been described: technique, nahda , modernity, this preciously deferred question will dissolve on its own, become minor- we need to go far back, to the source. Belief aside, if we consider the Qur'an, the text around which the corpus of Arabo-Muslim thought has emerged, we occasionally recognize snatches of narrative. A narrative in pieces, in edifying parcels, integrated through discontinuity into discourse, serving to reinforce idea with example, to put the quality of parable or the proof of mystery in its proper place.</page><page sequence="12">Winter 1999 25 Thus figures and stories are linked together through biblical, evangelical, mythological, and apocryphal reminiscences; figures and stories constituting the collective heritage of this orient, to be crossed in its rivers and deserts, and which are always interpreted, set in motion by a specific game; figures and stories rectified by the coherence of a dogma claiming to be the last link of the open chain which anteceeds it. They are figures and stories which are quoted either in the division and dissemination of the work or in laconic comments, figures and stories which emerge and vanish according to inspiration. We have left the biblical narrative with its linearity, its continuity, which follows a chronological framework, relating events and impressions in great detail, and with a simplicity that, like Qur'änic dissemination, is of a distinctly archaic quality. An example: the narrative about Abraham (not to mention the references) is divided as follows throughout the Qur'änic text: II, 124-140; XI, 69-76; XIV, 35-41; XV, 51-60; XIX, 41-50; XXI, 51-73; XXVI, 69-103; XXIX, 16-25; XXXVII, 83-113. Here are three examples illustrating the linking of narratives within the unity of a single súra: - In the sùra of the Cave (Qur'än, XVIII), meant to express divine power and will as well as the unfathomable depths of mys- teries, after the opening in the form of exhortations begins the wonderfully enigmatic narrative of the story of the seven sleepers of Ephesus ("the men of the cave," 9-27) , followed first by two parables (that "of the two men," 32-42; and that of "life in this world," 45-46) , then by a sequence of the life of Moses (60-82) , finally by Alexander the Great's excluding the yajúj and majïij, Gog and Magog, from the world (83-98). - In the sùra of Mary (Qur'än, XIX) the succession of anec- dotes concerning Zachariah (2-15), Mary (16-35), Abraham (41- 50), etc. - In the sùra of "The Ants" (Qur'än, XXVII) the coupling of events concerning Moses (7-12) , Solomon and the queen of Sheba (a very beautiful narrative, 13-44), the prophet of Thamùd, Sãlih (45-52), Lot and the damnation of Sodom (54-58). Thus do the characters appear and overshadow one another, commanded only by the force of vision in a hasty narrative. But it has been promised that the book contains the most beautiful of narratives in the story of Joseph, the only one to be told from begin- ning to end, from the dream to its "realization," in the splendor of a single sùra (Qur'än, XII) . It is a complete, exemplary, total narrative in which projects and characters confront one another through the destiny of the hero as he ascends in all his purity, having overcome hardships, to power and triumph. It is a narrative organized in</page><page sequence="13">26 Discourse 21.1 a series of sequences emphasizing a triple progression: the plots (that of the brothers: 8-18; that of the unnamed intendant's wife: 21-29); hardship and prison (35-49); intercession, science and power (50-100) . This is a narrative of great stylistic richness, of rare density in certain scenes (particularly the one in which, on seeing Joseph, the women guests- enchanted- cut their fingers, proof of the irresistible beauty of the nubile one [30-32]), of astonishing narrative economy, with in certain parts matching scenes that could facilitate a filmic cutting (the coming-and-going between Jacob and Joseph, the desert and Egypt: the major moments of articulations and cuts between these two spaces appear in verses 67-69, 82-83, 87-88, 93-94, and 98-99) . It is a narrative to be abandoned, at this moment of writing, because of the sketchiness of these undeveloped notes. It is a tale requiring the fragile, interrupted brilliance of a supreme mise en scène. 22. The Polygon of the Sufi The word grows, pursued in its very evolution by its primary meaning; it is not diverted to the point of implying a hidden or buried meaning. Etymology is therefore a relative science in Arabic: to recount ( qassa : to cut is the primary meaning) we are simul- taneously confronted with cutting, with size, with shaping, with assemblage, matching, montage ( tarkib ) of a subject matter to be related by the motor of the discontinuous. The way in which the Sufi relates is, as one would expect, inspired by the Qur'än: in its form, its theme, its techniques, and meditation. He flies up into the vastness of the didactic poem, pruning the underbrush of knowledge in order to rise through the teaching to the summit of being. Like Rùmï who, in his Masnavi, unfurls thousands of verses relating the world according to the plural orders of its complexity: we sense that this master of the exact science is confronted, through his gift and defiance, with the elaboration of a text as total as the one which within him, if favorably glossed, blazes with light: the Turko-Iranians read the Masnavi as a Qur'ân ' ajami ' All of the word's possible resources are interpreted, woven together in it. In a plurality of registers, the narrative is manipulated with the fantasy of flagrant mastery: Rùmï begins a story, abandons it, tells another, then yet another engendered by the second one, develops a commentary, proposes principles of wisdom, laws, engraves a few gnomic verses with his incisive pen, only to return at last to the abandoned story, taking it up again, pursuing it, refining it, making you forget it again in yet another embedded story, once more</page><page sequence="14">Winter 1999 27 finding it, incomplete, in the heart of this new plot, and finishing it the third time. Thus does the endless text unfold, with no particular insistence, with neither argument nor scenic justification, with no dramatic alibi other than its own unfurling, its doubling back, the dispersal of its riches in ears subdued by the song's unfailing unity of tone. If in Rùmï's text and other Sufi texts we find the metaphor of the starry polygon and the calligraphic emblem of the Kufic labyrinth, both joyfully visualizing the rhythm, the breath, the composition generative of a loss of self in ecstasy and rapture, in another major Sufi work, that of Farid ud-Din 'Attar, Mantiq at-Tayr, the narrative structure refers us to the tree , to the river and its tributaries, to the body and its members. Inspired by the Qur'anic episode of the lapwing in the story of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (Qur'an, XXVII, 13-44; the title of the work Mantiq at-Tayr being a partial quotation of verse 16), 'Attar recounts the birds' journey to the Simorgh, a symbol for the progression of the individual toward the one, through the valleys which signify the hierarchical stations of the quest (the valley of love, ' ishq ; of knowledge, ma'rifa ; of sufficiency, istighna ; of unity, tawhid; of anxiety, hayra' of destitution and annihilation, faqr wa fana). But the central plot is constantly interrupted by anecdotes, tales, fables, teachings drawn from the edifying survey of Asian, Islamic and other traditions. The return to the body, to the trunk, occurs through acceleration, then is suspended, remaining nevertheless an intransigent presence, for coming back to life through one's own vigor is the rule. Thus is the parabolic plot advanced and activated, then immobilized at each break. This more mechanistic discontinuity is better oriented dramatically, but pulverization remains the driving force of the text even though the branches never spread so far as to cast a shadow over the entire trunk. 23. An Undeceived People As comfortably incantatory, brief, elliptical, evanescent, rem- iniscent, and visionary as Qur'anic narrative is, as much as Sufi narrative practices the scattered/gathered method, as much as traditional narrative institutes a laborious, insistent, ruminating, lengthy, endlessly deferred continuity, attempting to act by enlarg- ing the field of language through a succession of events, multiplying phatic signals, a profusion of redundancies, the will to exploit the slightest springboard in order to revive interest in the fiction, so does the word ascend the episodes, through a protuberance and quantitative investment in the infinity of a marvel rich in inex- haustible repetitions of the same narrative model (see Miquel).</page><page sequence="15">28 Discourse 21.1 But such continuity is forcibly broken by crossings and move- ment, by travel to real and imagined countries. But such unity does not ignore the provocative necessity of the overlapping that disrupts the apparent calm of the serial narrative. Beyond the concretization of literality, beyond the need to paint the world in rosy colors (in a popular, Egyptian version, Joseph's Qur'anic triumph, eloquent though modest, was not enough for the narrator; he had to have the hero find the wife of 'Aziz, the intendant, and marry her- a marriage leading to great happiness and many children!), beyond the non-originality of the narrative framework which never tires of the same processes, the depth of signs is relentlessly acquired in insignificant traces, the grandeur of the text moves toward the dawn of myth, insidiously stimulating the body to risk that which exceeds it, a mad gesture braving the impossible and affecting the apparent optimism in order to mark the place of the drama: the layer of dust which covers so many public places and which collects in the certain pleasure at hearing the story exaggerated by the derision that flies from mouth to ear so as to learn to restore the unerring echo of song, the one of nothing to lose, of not giving a damn - swinging lanterns that light, through storms and windy weather, the way of those who gladly take us onto their boats. 24. Khayãl az-Zill In the preceding pages, we have profiled a precondition, a shortcoming yet to be unearthed in the still fresh archeological dig around the image and the narrative. It is a precondition con- cerning literature and painting as much as cinema, an exploratory moment in which these three regions of expression, in spite of their constantly proclaimed relative autonomy, blur the boundaries that protect them. It is a precondition which leads us, in slow and patient certainty, to the theater of shadows, the neighboring and as if prospective form of cinema, by the shadow of a candle, of an analogical cinema, whose origins lie in the photo and its being set into motion, of a make believe dating from the pre-machine, pre- electricity era. For Arab cities have also known the silhouette theater whose presence and popularity were recorded as early as the Xllth century under the name of Khayãl az-Zill (the illusion of shadows).5 This was a shadow theater whose most famous author was a certain Ibn Danyal (1248-1311), a Mesopotamian active in Cairo and who pro- duced texts characteristic of the genre ( Tayf al-Khayal , al-Mutayyam , etc.) or staged tales from the popular, oral tradition (the Sudan war, the Persian war), manipulations and narratives transmitted from master to disciple, through the initiatic chain governing guilds.</page><page sequence="16">Winter 1 999 29 It was an expression which can only satisfy the parabolic mind of the Sufis, who have woven a metaphor which has since become proverb: Of the characters and shadows which pass and fade All disappears The puppet master alone remains. (Wajld ad-DIn Diyã') It was a type of spectacle perpetrated with dissemination throughout the south-Mediterranean of the Turkish character of Karakuz, delighting in a disrespectful, obscene, pornographic, and scatological popular evening's entertainment. From Istanbul to Tunis, many travelers have testified to the presence of its efficacy: "... then behind the gauze we saw a decoration depicting a square in Constantinople, a fountain and houses in the foreground. Next passed in succession a kavass, a dog, a water-bearer, and other mechanical characters in distinctly-colored clothes; they were not mere silhouettes as in the shadow shows that we were accustomed to," writes Nerval from Istanbul, a text to be consulted for the pages devoted to a session of this type of spectacle (Nerval 476-85; see also Gautier, ch. 14). "A little stage, with a curtain of transparent canvas is set up as a background for the shadows," Gide reports while traveling through Tunis in the spring of 1896 (71-72). Such plays attained topicality through their critical, satirical, anti-Ottoman and anti-colonial notations, the cause of their periodic ban in Egypt and Tunisia, and their definitive ban in Algeria in 1943. V. Art/Technique/Ideology 25. Techne To refuse Ibn Khaldùn's historical outline, to denounce its ideological shortcomings and pretentions, to clear away its speech place or makhzanian ,6 does not mean to erase what he has written. It remains a precious source for he who wishes to understand the mechanisms of Arab society in certain of its details. His text, on the edge of declining central powers, doubled by the perpetration of the regression of peoples, constitutes an exact synthesis of the states of a bygone world persevering to live on the body of its experiences, with the ups and downs of decadence, with no major perturbation up to the intrusion of modernity and Technique onto its native soil. So we return to Ibn Khaldùn to deepen the very foundation of the problematics of modernity, namely Technique.</page><page sequence="17">30 Discourse 21.1 In his classification of the social activities and practices of "civ- ilization," Ibn Khaldùn uses two categories: sinaãt and 'ulürn (Al Muqaddima 349-81 ) . If the former (from the root 'a.l.m. = knowledge, 'ulum = sci- ences) covers theoretical practices- those of thought, reflection - with two great directions, on the one hand philosophy, the intel- lectual sciences, the sciences of numbers; on the other hand the religious sciences (Qur'an and Hadïth) and their derivatives (law, linguistics, mysticism) . The second (from the root s.n. ' a . = to make, to do, sinä'ät = skills) includes all modes of know-how: writing ( kitãba ), calligraphy ( khatt ), architecture, agriculture, carpentry, medicine, sewing, music, various applied arts and crafts, in a word, the equivalent of the Greek techne , with no distinction between craft, artistic, and industrial practices. This is the source of the primary meaning of technique : "A set of processes used to produce a work or obtain a determined result" (Le Robert ), while fann, which in Ibn Khaldùn 's work meant the set of rules characteristic of a given craft, and thus analogous to one of the primary meanings of art (ars, artis)-3. means, a method - is used today to name the fine arts (the seventh art = al-fann as-sabi '). The sinä'ät, Ibn Khaldùn says, are acquired through practice, through experience passing through the body, through the confir- mation of a mastery (malaka), (from the root m.l.k. = to possess), obtained through the repetition of the same series of gestures until a reflex is produced. For such teaching, a master (mu'allim) is necessary, so that with time work emerges from ability: only duration can fructify latency. 26. Technique Finally we approach the century, we approach cinema. So many inevitable detours, ephemeral arabesques into history and its signs. So many pauses, too, to be repeated by the graph in all their imposing silence. Where thought breathes, attempting to choose the sap or to swarm. Where it congeals on knotting the broken thread. Moving down the road of the word, we discover an Arab world traumatized in its élite by the shock it suffered in the confrontations that opened it to the covetousness of Western powers. It receives the violent offer of a hegemonic world armed with Technique, a set of gigantic processes dedicated to the transforma- tion of nature. Vain attempts were undertaken to change its own</page><page sequence="18">Winter 1 999 31 space through the possession of new knowledges and applications, the procurers of power: the inaugural experience of the Khedive Muhammad 'Ali, in Egypt, was short-lived, that of Khayr ad-DIn, in Tunisia, could not afford its own policies. The major figure of 'Abd al-Qãdir, an eloquent representation of the fecund cohabitation of the learned and the popular, the theological and that of the brotherhood, the mystic and the progressive, was historically de- feated; all that remained for him was recourse to the fertile retreat of damascene retirement, broad enough to allow him to restore the buried text of Ibn al-' Arabi, a magnified ash-Shaykh al-Akbar, through his gloss. Time passes, nations fall. Craftsmanship is lost and Technique slips away. Time passes and skill spoils. Duration could not favor latency. 27. Ideology of the Nahda Voices are heard. Extreme solutions are imposed. But incom- petence persists. And the golden age haunts the mind living a vile today. Only the worst of the dominating West is retained- its new theology- positivism, in order to advocate a return to the source articulated with a justifiable entry into modernity. From this fact, all manner of debates and conflicts settle into a place, where by common agreement, the famous part, through excess and immoderation, the indomitable part of tradition is banished, buried away, its very preoccupations associated with wandering, the cause of a paralyzing historical backwardness. Sufism and its continuous relationship to the people, the texts which allowed our thought to grow and act in this very place, were rejected, brushed aside, condemned- fabulated non-reason, barbary- by scholars, a mixture of traditionalists and modernists, that the era of the ersatz may prosper, that minds and hands may be harnessed to the task of the Arabization of the by-product. Of the great intellectuals of the end of the preceding century and of this century, only the Pakistani Muhammad Iqbal escaped as a poet from the intrusion of the reduction of the word's power, an original attitude in spite of the tired formulation of its problematics. Such is the operation now famous under the prestigious name of Nahda , whose henchmen have stubbornly insisted on obliterating the oriental pole of thought and being in the very orient itself. 28. The Appendage But the peoples eluded such projects and traps. Archaism tena- ciously survived on the fringe. Success was produced as the flashy decor of the copy loomed up in a sort of excrescence. To live</page><page sequence="19">32 Discourse 21.1 abroad without leaving the country. Devoid of retro nostalgia, a form of glory shone between the two wars in certain spheres. This was the era of the tango Arabized by the passionate Asmahãn, with make up like Garbo's and a voice like Marlene Dietrich's; that of private circles listening to an as yet unsymphonized/unsiphoned Umm Kulthùm, still accompanied by an 'ùd and discrete percus- sion instruments; that of Italian-style, neo-baroque and neo-classical villas in Garden City; that of the Prince of Poets Ahmad Shawqî, declaiming neo-romantic odes; that of 'Abdelwahab, smooth and full in his song and juvenile presence, appearing to advantageous on-screen swoonings in al-Warda al-Baydã '; the time of an aristocra- sized bourgeoisie cultivating the good life in a carefree moment of history; the cheapness of decadence before the irremisable end; the era of the learned Taha Husayn, perhaps the most frequently read author and thinker of Arab modernity, introducer and defender of the Cartesian method, of the Sorbonnard processes in bibliographic literary criticism, a sort of Sainte-Beuve; the era of the bank Misr, founded in 1920 by Tal'at Harb, a bank instituting a "national" cin- ema, a cinema-ghetto, cinema-studio, dispensing a certain mastery, in eternal genres; the era of the illusion of a believable "national" capitalism, to be directed by the very ones who got rich through their political collaboration with the colonizers (Riad 76-84) . This was an aristocratic ghetto, Garden City, Zamalek, Studio Misr, Shäri' Fu'äd, the opera. Maydãn al-' Ataba al-Khadrã' was the border separating worlds, classes, which did not communicate. From a ghetto which is not that of the submissive minority, a hege- monic ghetto, diffusing models of being in the cities and in the heart of Arab petty bourgeoisies. Then, through the force of history, they wanted to integrate the abroad into the country, rather than proceed to the removal of the appendage, the eradication of the excrescence. Lanterns and lusters were carried off in the ensuing panic. An entire unadapted infrastructure was sought after through inappropriate gestures. The division between the worlds no longer exists: no more Jamaliya, an historic proletarianized neighborhood, or Tawfiqiya, a chic Euro- peanized neighborhood- the entire city is crossed by the same inco- herence, permeating all its buildings, constructions, monuments, dead and living, abetted by ruin, the suspension of the separation mobilized by history. So much for Cairo. For Algiers, no more Casbah on the one hand, no more rue d'lsly on the other. Have you crossed Algiers at the time of the sacrifice commemorating our ancestor Abraham? The mastery of the immolation itself is lost and blood stains the floors and walls, the balconies and terraces, a blood bath in a city evading the desacralized gesture through its hesitation before the act itself, hands trembling beneath the fragile verticality</page><page sequence="20">Winter 1 999 33 of TV antennas shaken by a dizzying wind. Two landscapes to relate, through the irrefutable image controlled by the word, the status of our ideological condition, and the vigorous, sad monstrosity of our present suffering from a heterogeneity in which it is necessary to look/ see, to live, so that analysis may progress without crushing the eye or smashing the skull, without pausing to sing any tarnished refrains. European forms of expression were adopted, but only rarely did they include the countries and peoples. They were of an impasse going beyond people. Plays were written, characterized by a light vulgarity, or an awkward emphasis of historical drama. Novels were put on, at best in the fashion of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, of Mau- passant, or in a bold naturalism like that of Zola. Nothing, aside from rare, important, and very recent experiments - that of the Sudanese Tayeb Salih, or especially of the Palestinian Kanafani, whose texts hold together by their violence and their survival on the flesh of the earth, the blood of the people, the spark of the event- outside of the worn processes secreting a particular procedure for each subject matter. Nothing written like we breathe, according to that which innately appeals to our sensibility, in the dissemination and discontinuity succinctly described above. Nothing if not a few mum- bled words, if not Nedjma, by Kateb Yassin, written in French, which relativizes the question of language. Paintings were made, but only pseudo-works were produced, devoid of all mastery. Nothing was thought or created with what we have revealed of the topics of the image. Nothing if not a few painters who, though they had the skill, never really came to grips with their reality. Shirqãwl, one of the best Arab painters, who occasionally attains a well-balanced luminescence, cannot be seen, in spite of his innate intuition of color, without reference on the basic level to Klee and Rouault, on the historical level to the Paris school of the 60s, Bissière 8c Co (see Maleh, et al.). Films were shot. To this end novels were adapted (practically all of Cairo naturalist Naguïb Mahfùz's work): nothing that goes beyond artful balminess, dramatic hoodlumry, or weight of stereo- type, if not certain works which deserve, for the justification of this filmic instance, to be discussed without complacency. VI. On National Cinema 30. Preferences - Here we are on the extreme edge. This we which at times veils a modest I, is at other times weighted down with a common destiny.</page><page sequence="21">34 Discourse 21.1 -What right have you to demand this we? Who dares bear it? What shoulders, what backbone can support its history? -A we drifts between the intimacy of the individual and the hearth of perseverance; an unconsidered we, required by instinct. -What? You fear the hearth may go out. Let the priestesses' swift fingers bring fire back to the ashes. Come back to the text woven here. - From beginning to beginning, it builds up, it splits up, it advances. -What have you to say now that the density of saying has nearly wrapped you in the purple veil bearing you away to lands that have lost the haggling of the word? - Patience; wait. The crossing is nearly complete. - Say it. Be brief: like the arrow flying toward its target. - I would like to speak of films loved through their positions in the space of the machine, their subject matter, their writings. -What orients your choice, your preferences? -What rises from the ruts, what dares repeat stereotypes as it surpasses skill, what is not deceived by the tricks of the machine. - But still . . . - First a word about the national cinema that all Arab countries are calling out for. It would exist in each country if the bureaucracy were to found it; but production belies the institution; the only Arab cinema is the Egyptian one: through its history, the quality and the quantity of its works, the relative research of its directors. Other Arab films hark back to another analogy than the simple love/hate story that monopolizes the shooting of every film; they make up a perilous, exhausting adventure, in search of a specific voice, a voice to be modulated in the jargon accompanying the discrete humming of the machine, between shadows and light, between tensions and balances of power. -You are unfair. Hasn't Algerian cinema transformed other Arab cinemas through its thematics? Hasn't it offered up history to free them from the limitations of genre? Does it not qualify as a national cinema? It never stops harping- through its heroes and victims- on the events leading up to national liberation. - Indeed! Not that a national cinema shouldn't repeat the same scenery, the same characters, the same subjects in every film. The main thing is to achieve the rigor of the film within the framework of technical, economic, and thematic incarcerations. Surely, the novelty of the present appeals to us in Omar Gatlato, in which the misery of the petty bourgeois, Algiers sister of Naples, gets a good laugh. From an ordinary cinema that will toss us into the current of a knowing mockery.</page><page sequence="22">Winter 1 999 35 -Which films will you now discuss? -There are seven of them. Four from Egypt: al-Azima (1939), by Kamãl Salïm; The Journal of a Country Prosecutor (1965) , by Tawfiq Sãlih; al-Bustaguï (1968), by Husayn Kamãl; finally an indepen- dent film, one from outside the machine, like all of the following, The Mummy (1968), by Shãdí 'Abd al-Salãm; from Tunisia, Sejnane (1973), by Abdellatif Ben Ammar; from Morocco, Washma (1970), by Hamid Bannani; and from Syria, Daily Life in a Syrian Village (1974), by 'Umar Amiralay.7 -Just a moment! why don't you mention It's Not Enough That God Be with The Poor , a censured film? After all, you wrote the scenario, participated in location-scouting, in making preparations, in filming and editing. - I contest that film down to its very title. A film-amputee, hobbling between voids and unable to breathe in the creeping slowness of the scenery and the accents of the militant, timid doxa alone; a film on space which it only reproduces for lack of anything better. What a discrepancy between the final product and the initial project, which set out to gather up- by the very speed of the image - the fragments of contemporary Arab ideology through the crystalline mirror of architecture! A poisoned gift in the hands of he who takes credit for it, incensed, demanding his due, by the swift oligarchy as counter-power to reproduce all the constructions of power! 31. Happy Ending Al-' Azima, "will," is the narrative par excellence, brought off without a hitch. It functions on the confrontation of the hero, M'hammad, a serious petty bourgeois who, diploma in hand, is busy climbing the social ladder in spite of difficulties and unemploy- ment, and the anti-hero, Ttr, the successful neighborhood butcher. The former is as perfect as the latter is detestable. They constitute two matrices representing two differing points of view. Every event has two functions: on the one hand evil and wickedness, on the other good and kindness. An infallible symmetry of the double morphological function. These two adventures center on the girl, the object of their quest. She is the product of a complete per- version: a passive father, totally repressed, sympathetic, her ally; an authoritarian, virile mother, her potential enemy. The story unfolds through this duality governed by the pair amelioration/ degradation : when M'hammad loses, Ttr wins, and vice versa; one's failure is the other's success, each one supported by his clan (adjuvants/ opponents) .</page><page sequence="23">36 Discourse 21.1 It's an interminable narrative that could go on for hours, so worn out is the narrative scheme. It ends with the ultimate victory of M'hammad, aided by his allies, professional dedication, conjugal bliss, universal success in the face of an analogous failure, and supreme good after pitfalls and unexpected incidents. Through a strengthening of will, the nearly final debacle was transformed into a triumphant epilogue. The diversion is now obsolete. This film is an exemplary rep- resentation of stereotypical Egyptian cinema in its recourse to this universal narrative scheme. It is a work whose lineage will be as- sured by Salãh Abü Sayf, with his characteristic simplification and exuberance. A work which, through the fastidious complexity of its narrative, proposes a sort of density recognizable in the nostalgia of the principal space, the alley-way, the neighborhood, the hero's place of origin, felt each time we move toward the place of gilded, frivolous youth or of irresponsible, capricious bureaucracy. The shadow of American cinema is seen in the proximity of certain signs and continuities: shots like that of the telephone, the office, the ashtray, the woman, hat and tailor, appearing unexpect- edly, strongly recall similar images in Frank Capra. Through its skillful writing, al-'Azïma impresses one as exem- plary work, through its very representativeness of a studio cinema historically called upon to describe the promotional possibilities of the petty bourgeoisie on the stage of technocratic, national power. 32. The Stolen Urn There are those sovereign directors who can create ambiguity in the very conventions they adopt, emptying them out from within, denouncing their inefficacy by applying them, and wearing them out by the unorthodox way in which they use them. Such is the case of Tawfïq Sãlih in The Journal of a Country Prosecutor ; a film inspired by the novelesque work of Tawfïq al- Hakïm. A rare case in which the filmic adaptation outshines its written source, in which the image better demonstrates what was supposedly sufficient in the word. From a criminal investigation, from the confrontation of au- thority, represented by the machinery of the judicial system and the police, with the population of a rural region. Nothing if not by the strategy of withdrawal typical of the peasantry, it is impossible to capture or take up that useful speech which moves the investigation along to witnesses who seem submissive enough in their good- natured allegiance to the State.</page><page sequence="24">Winter 1999 37 Consequently the film functions in emptiness; the administra- tive ritual turns back on itself without being able to reach a success- ful conclusion. Three attitudes cross at the heart of the trial: that of the young intern terrified by his discovery of the breach between reality and newly-acquired theory; that of the old judge, a finicky, routine-bound, scrupulous, inconsequent daydreamer more famil- iar with a fantasized topography than with what he sees and hears; and finally that of the prosecutor, a mature, self-assured young man who respects administrative regulations without ever being deceived by them, in no way resigning, but possessing a lucidity which tempers his basic ardor. On the side of the police, a villain quick to turn over any criminal case to the most careless investigator so as to devote himself to carrying out the instructions of the Minister of the Interior to direct elections in any way possible toward a vote favorable to the government. The plot is merely a pretext to show scenery and people, and the film ends without ever resolving the enigma from which it issued. The knot which shook the village at the outset, in the middle of the night, was never untied. Dramatic positivity is canceled, and instead of the body we expected to be fished out of the river, an urn emerges, the fleeting, pathetic sign of a democracy that was known to be if not drowned, murdered, then at least ridiculed. This type of denunciation runs throughout the film, implicitly, never getting carried away in the flames of sermon or diatribe. In every respect, it is the non-positive work par excellence. It shows and describes a country and the distrust it harbors toward institutions which do not emanate from its own reality, but are the voluntaristic adaptations of modalities whose play, affinity and duty cannot be understood except by the fringes of the Cairo populace and big cities. A report made to us from the point of view of the administration even when it is not deceived by its own authority. A report whose origin, history, and archeology are described by Husayn Fawzi. There is speech which says nothing, in spite of a meritorious delivery which is hardly parsimonious. The more it delights in circumlocutions, the more it hides, creating a labyrinth of words so that reason panics to the point of getting lost. It's the speech of the ordinary witness. There is metaphoric, poetic speech, a rebus to be deciphered for he who can. It's that of the madman, accompanied by a gaze torn from its softness and provocative in its social gratuity. The character of the madman haunts Arab cinema. Many films have gotten around it. Never has a work integrated it so well in its flow, outside folklore, outside sketchy vaticinations. There is the precocious young woman with her enchanting beauty, the source of lechery or love troubles, the main part of</page><page sequence="25">38 Discourse 21.1 the crime committed. She possesses a disconcerting ingenuity so ambiguous that we do not know if she is being playful or sincere. A woman of few words, she is both fleeing and present before the additional complication of her disappearing for good. Woman is thus shown in an intangible, almost magical reality, which is rare in Egyptian cinema, whose women are either lively and fulfilled or hysterical and frustrated. 33. The Conspiracy of Genres Like personalized destinies, al-Bustagui (The Mailman) tells of the irreconcilable differences separating the city from the country. A lower middle-class Cairo mailman is more than exiled when he is assigned to a Sa'Id village with its bare rock, its astral drought, and its hellish heat. He finds the village a hostile, closed, hierar- chized, clannish world, a citadel of bodies, and feels he must either submit or resign. His own fierce incomprehension drives him into an unbearable solitude, a cloister crowded with a growing pile of tin cans. The film settles into the slow but steady description of the post- man's decline, though he is anxious at first to disassociate himself, in his elegance, punctuality and professional consciousness, from the village and its unscrupulous officials who live by archaic laws that he reviles. But the dialectic of energies, the weighing up of personalities, the logic of the landscape, and the uninterrupted duration of the plot eat away at the character from the very beginning to the point of dispelling all doubt at his own inescapable future as a victim. All we shall see is the successive crumbling away of a resistance mechanism, vulnerable in its individuality, and built on an erroneous foundation designed with the illusory belief in the invincibility of his urban origins in the all but autarkic reality of the village, with its sense of closure and self-sustenance, a consciousness which renders his function as connection through the word between the village and the outside world all the more artificial, as such connections are hardly necessary. Were they to be cut off, the village would not perish. So many postures encouraging the public to willingly adopt a sadistic perversion so as to admire the ruin to which the irrevocable mechanism will inevitably lead. Yet the social and psychological entropy is doubled, on the way, by the clandestine romance between a village girl and a young man that she met in a boarding school in Asyùt, and the film, though it makes no claims to an esthetic of the heterogeneous, combines genres: the psycho-social drama of the mailman on the one hand,</page><page sequence="26">Winter 1 999 39 and the typically Egyptian melodrama on the other, and the intense meeting of the two storylines through the connection of the letters exchanged between the hunted lovers and read by the idle mailman. The atmosphere is stifling with interdictions, stirring up the storm that will explode in the final scene when the father kills his daughter who is bearing the child of her banished lover; the patriarch avenges himself of what the superego identifies with tarnished honor in a crescendo scene orchestrating the duration of the village under the sign of its own law which unfolds according to the accepted ritual of death, stripped bare, dust, the black gowns of the mourners, the tears of the father, faced with the distraught, guilty, troubled, weak, dumbfounded gaze of the mailman, with his unshaven face, irretrievably lost. 34. The Instance of the Father All I have to say about The Mummy- it is enough to recall the stream of gibes that this work elicited from the Cairo public at the time of its furtive commercial programming to realize just how strange it must have appeared to movie-goers more used to turning away from, scoffing at, or shouting down standard films, since, sitting in the dark, it would have been torture had they not laughed, their way of affirming out loud that they couldn't be taken in - is the instance of the father. With the death of the real father, the initiation to the secret by right of inheritance, the turmoil, the anguish and refusal to perpetrate paternal economic reason; with the emptiness that such hesitation and anxiety provoke; with the scenery haunted by signs of death; with the will of the madman/idiot to keep the child from searching for its father; with the broken friendship, the threatening shadow of the tribe, the refusal of fathers who offer themselves through uncles, the accumulation of pain, the ups and downs of stalling, out of need, through an imperious safeguard, the traumatized adolescent gives himself entirely to the archeologist, the new man, the stranger, the city floating for days on an immacu- late, white boat; he gives himself, betrays his own people, reveals the secret, dashes the hopes of the tribe, an offering so that the chosen father may act out of recognition. The approval of the outsider with the calm aggressiveness procured by the favors and competence of science, protected by the army, was vital to the rebellious child. The curious scene in which the acceptance of the young man by the archeologist, the child by the father, is sealed by an engagement, an apparently nuptial intimacy, having entered the enclosure of the confessional, a far too Christian procedure in which the avowal frees him of guilt through the symbolic donation of the body.</page><page sequence="27">40 Discourse 21.1 To see another aim in The Mummy, to make us believe that it is a parabolic work on the threshold of contemporary Egyptian history, is to be either short-sighted or gullible. For the film is not about the authenticity of events, nor the symbolism of history which could be read into it; rather it concerns the clues revealed by the writing itself, by the insistent esthetic of the image, by the literary quality of the word. It is a work of writing, idiolectal, of a musical composition in which the author is authenticated through the harmony of movements. If the filmmaker's argument were to evoke or even echo history, the plurality of Egypts, he would have obtained a meager truth, for in view of the space he has described, the important thing- the Pharaohnic remanence in the imaginations, the capacities for withdrawal, the future of archaism- would have quickly slipped through his fingers like a handful of sand dropped by degree of summer incandescence. 35. Of Equal Blood I shall not follow Sejnane down the road it so cleverly opens to us. I shall not first see it as a double film on political awareness and the oppression of women. I would simply be falling into a trap out of an overly insistent concern for its construction. I shall leave aside the slowness, the occasional lethargy of its rhythm, the thinness of certain anonymous characters. I shall turn away from the lack of passion that transluces the work to the point of extreme lactency. To judge by the signs, we return to or discover the Tunis of the 50s, depicted with the proper intensity of good-natured violence which nevertheless took its toll in human life, with the reveal- ing nuances of preliminary analysis, with the variety of historical spaces - Sadiki College, the seat of the UGTT, the meetings in which the internal contradictions of the nationalist movement discreetly and implicitly came to light, a place of work and paternalism of the worker/boss relationship, the salon of Tunis decadence in which the blind musician (perhaps the film's most accomplished character) gives lessons-. Spaces crossed by the main character, a highschool student expelled for political agitation, having lost his father, a militant nationalist who was assassinated, seeking the support (demanded as a necessary phase) of a paternal shoulder, of an image of the father disseminated through those of the timorous teacher, the resemblant musician, the owner of the printing house, his future boss, and finally the unionist whose friendship liberated the character, so to speak, allowing him to surpass the question of the father and repudiate at least two of them (the teacher and the boss) , to become</page><page sequence="28">Winter 1999 41 even more involved in political-unionist activities, and pay for his advanced sense of logic with the unforseeable blood sacrifice, the equivalent of a loss of self, a symbolic death penetrating the body of the young girl, in an arranged marriage, the consenting victim for an inaugural phallus which is neither cherished nor desired in its fabulated idiosyncrasy, the instrument whose immediate efficacy was to be demonstrated in blood, the simultaneous function at the very moment of knowledge of the other: the spouse. All in all, the two young people- boy and girl - are destined, according to highly divergent degrees of awareness, to a victim's truth, for the finality of the sacrificial altar. Thus, and through the two deaths, the meeting will have taken place any way. If the barely pubescent girl seems if not to accept, then at least not to go against her tragic destiny, the boy, hardly rejoicing over his liberation at turning in on oneself through a course of action now possible in the political field, fails at the event that he and his friends have most certainly provoked but whose effects he could not control: the strike in which he took part was most likely the cause of his death. His death has probably nourished, perhaps hastened, a consolation from beyond the grave, the inescapable historical process in which he participated while still alive. 36. The Trace and the Child It is precious that the work which, more than any other, drew its sustenance from life at its most personal, renders in substance and reality the cultural space in which it appears. So it is with Washma , a meditative, quiet film, tinged with a tender cruelty. The child, the passive rebel of adoption, endeavors to affirm his independence by constructing a secret world in which stolen objects will take their place on the stone table of fetishes, before crossing the fear and shudder of punishment. But this trajectory would have perished in a mechanically and intellectually connoted psychologism were it not for the ambiguity and unplanned density which saved the work from such a risk. And the sign which was filmed to illustrate psychological accumulation, flees the pursuing intent and ends up working like a series of traces , culminating in the mark on the body, the tattoo (washma), the indelible sign which will be used, through narrative economy, to guarantee the passage of the fragile, reserved body of the child, to that of the adolescent, member of a gang of thugs forming their own territory at the edge of the city, in the shadow of a wall, a ruin, familiarizing us with their home, in which friendship is built and protected, an enclosure for love, power and affinities, possessing at night and in the forest, the unreal, mythical</page><page sequence="29">42 Discourse 21.1 woman with the audacity of an apparition, signifying the absence of women in daily life, in social life, in physical life. And the entire film revolves around a diffused, ambiguous, unnamed sexuality which is heavy at times, hovering as on the edge of a terrible threat, the exact equivalent of that which social life covers, that which the cultural system contains when it shapes, in the home, what retains bodies in capacities holding back the explosion in them, or differing coital concretization. 37. The Lesson of Cinema To begin Daily Life in a Syrian Village with a light sandstorm in which the temporality of erasure and burial is inscribed is a way of describing through an effect of nature what a camera can do by filming space: the eye offers the imagination a reality in the process of transforming itself evolving, in the silence inhabited by natural music. Thus does the eye enter the daily life of a Syrian village, Mawal- iyya, at the approach of the desert, on the fringe, in an archaism seeking to remain clear-sighted while invigorating itself through an initiation to the protest of class struggle, which is more apt to wake rather than bury it. Thus does the daily chronicle decompose, exacerbated as it is by the presence of the camera which provokes that which lodges there like an irritable latency. Thus is the revealing function of cinema activated, through the intervention of a strangeness which is that of neither the bureaucrat nor the technocrat (doctor, engineer), nor the instructor (the militant school teacher who is hardly embarrassed by an inadequate manual) . Thus is the somber word recorded on obscure images, in dis- couraging and sullen times, by the people stuck on the one hand between social relationships perpetuating an ancestral domination and oppression overdetermined by the intelligence of those privi- leged enough to open themselves to modernity so as to enlarge their own experiences; and on the other the agents of authority, local representatives of the State, recruited to stamp out such latency, to repress it even, to soothe anything which could conspire to express or agitate it. Speech and faces eloquent by their very presence, to the point that it was only out of conventional naïveté to finish off the beauty of the film with the final sermon which seeks to establish the spectator's guilt through its militant loquaciousness.

Consequently, his contemplation of God in woman is the most perfect of the three, for he then contemplates God as he is both active and passive, while in the purely inner contemplation, he sees her only as passive." 3 Paris: Editions Cahiers du Sud, 1954. 4 We are referring only to monumental calligraphy here; regarding book or manuscript calligraphy, as well as the analysis of techniques and styles or metaphysics behind them, we refer the reader to the significant,</page><page sequence="38">Winter 1999 51 beautiful text by A.
