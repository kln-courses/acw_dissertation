<plain_text><page sequence="1">In the Company of Crows and Ravens . By John M. Marzluff and Tony Angeli. Illustrated by Tony Angeli. Foreword by Paul Ehrlich. New Haven: Yale UP, 2005. 384 pp. Cloth $30.00. Crows are "prominent features of urban landscapes in much of the world," according to ecologist Paul Ehrlich, with "high intelligence and humanoid behavior" that have captivated humans for centuries (ix, x). After years of archival and field research, John Marzluff and Tony Angeli have published In the Company of Crows and Ravens , the definitive work on crows, focusing on the interrelationship of crows and humans, particularly on how they affect each other's culture, ecol- ogy, and evolution. The authors concentrate on all species in the genus Corvus, including crows, rooks, and jackdaws (omitting other close relatives within the corvid family, such as jays and magpies). Humans have interacted with crows for millennia, as evidenced by stone-age cave drawings. Crows are also well represented in literature, from ancient legends such as that of the Norse god Odin, to the poem that coined the term "Jim Crow," to Edgar Allan Poe's famous poem "The Raven," to contemporary litera- ture. The authors also stress the ongoing relationship between crows and humans. Human settlement and its accompanying agriculture and trash have influenced crow ecology and evolution, while crows have become an important part of ours. Humans have not consistently viewed crows as smart or wily or valuable, in part because these om- nivores contribute to the cleanup of carrion and eat many destructive agricultural pests such as grasshoppers and gypsy moths. Marzluff and Angeli argue convincingly that crows deserve special consideration in any discussion of the relationship between humans and animals, but they occasionally anthropomorphize these birds. Crows are clever social creatures with complex vocalizations, so</page><page sequence="2">282 isle perhaps the anthropomorphism is not surprising. Although many of the case studies are persuasive, the authors occasionally overreach, for example, with the assertion that "crows had apparently learned to associate the [McDonald's] restaurant's logo with a tasty snack" (225). (Perhaps the crows recognize a variety of colorful bags as likely con- taining fast food scraps.) In other cases they attribute an exceptional character to the behavior of crows, behavior that is not unique to them. An example is the assertion that "crows culturally pass the behavior of using [bird] feeders and the food therein to their offspring," which ignores the fact that many species of birds "bring" their offspring (or are perhaps followed) to bird feeders (297). Tony Angeli drew the cover's beautiful pen-and-ink drawing of a crow on a cornstalk; unfortunately, the quality of the book's printing does not do his illustrations justice. The book includes an index, foot- notes, and references, as well as appendices on how to observe crows and a bibliography of children's literature that involves crows. In the Company of Crows and Raven's use of both scientific and literary sources provides a compelling argument for crow exceptionalism, and argu- ably it is this commingling of science and the humanities that makes this book significant.
