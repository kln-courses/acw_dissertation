<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Yogi and the Devotee: The Interplay between the Upanishads and Catholic Theology. By Ninian Smart. Pp. 174. London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1968. 30s. 'To explore the possibility of a Sanskrit theology for Christianity' as a 'better basis than the philosophical theology of Aquinas' was the aim of the Teape Lectures delivered in Delhi in 1964, enlarged here in a lively and readable form, ranging through Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist thought. The 'cultural tribalism' of the West is attacked in van Buren's secularism, in the 'unconscious fraud' of evangelical Pro testants like Kraemer, and in the Indian seminaries that teach Aquinas instead of Shankara and Ramanuja. But Smart also has criticisms of modern Indian syncretists, like Radhakrishnan, who hold that all religions are the same and monistic. The pretence that meditation (dhyana) is the basic form of mystical religion is countered by showing the prevalence of devotion (bhakti) in most religions, and since both dhyana and bhakti are indispensable they can only be held together in a theistic context. This disqualifies Shankara, the prince of monists, and it leaves Ramanuja as the model Indian teacher of natural theology, though it is not clear why this theology should be called natural, since Ramanuja believed in a personal God of grace. Ramanuja taught a 'qualified non-dualism' in which souls were regarded as the body of God though not identical with him, and he held 'a clear doctrine of divine transcendence' without becoming victim to 'the illusions of a superstitious anthropomorphism'. The Buddha is mentioned, but can hardly be fitted in, as an 'atheist' who did not even believe in the soul,</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 715 and at the end he reappears on the sidelines after Christ has been compared with Vishnu. But the questions of the Buddha's own faith, and that of others in him, and whether these were really atheistic, need fuller examination. In conclusion a 'Christ Upanishad' is sketched in which the Lord appears as the Holy Power of Brahman expressing itself in the Guru, Christ, in the human condition. This is a popular work and one of Smart's most interesting, not only a good introduction to Indian thought but sparkling with challenges and discussions of problems of great importance.
