<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON CHEKHOV'S CRAFTSMANSHIP: THE ANATOMY OF A STORY BY GLEB STRUVE In January, 1888, when Chekhov was working on his first long story, "The Steppe," he wrote to his friend, the poet Pleshcheev, at whose instigation he was writing that story for the review The Northern Messenger: All through January I have been working away at my steppe, not writing anything else, and am therefore absolutely ruined. If the Steppe is pub- lished later than March I shall howl like a wolf. I'll mail it to you by February 1st. If you foresee that there will be no room for it in the March issue, let me know, my dear man: I shan't hurry with the Steppe and shall write something for the New Times and the Petersburg Gazette for the sake of an honorarium. To write long things is most boring and muci more difficult than to write trifles.' In reply Pleshcheev told Chekhov that it would be a great pity if he were to put aside his Steppe and write some trifles for the newspapers for the sake of money. (Chekhov's elder contemporaries among the writers kept dinning this into his ears.) He urged Chekhov to give his shorter stories also to serious literary magazines. It pains me to think [wrote Pleshcheev] that you have written so many charming, truly artistic pieces and enjoy less fame than the writers who are not worthy to untie the strings of your shoes. And all this because of some lousy newspapers which are read one day and used as wrapping paper the next.2 But Pleshcheev's appeal came too late. Chekhov wrote back to him: My dear, dear Aleksei Nikolaevich, Many thanks for your kind, sweet note. What a pity it didn't arrive three hours earlier. [This was probably just a figure of speech: its arrival MR. STRUVE is professor of Slavic languages anid literatures at the UnZiversity of Cali- fornia, Berkeley.

In viewv of the approaching first of the month with its payments falling due I played a coward and sat down to a piece of hasty work. But that doesn't matter: the story did not require more than half a day and now I can go on with my Steppe (XIV, 23). The story which Chekhov thus described-perhaps not without a hint of false modesty-as "rather poor" and scratched in haste is one of the best stories of his middle period, if not one of his best short stories tout court. The story, called "Sleepy" ("Spat' khochetsia"), is about a thirteen-year-old girl who wvorks as a nursemaid in a cobbler's household -and is so cruelly exploited, and so utterly exhausted from lack of sleep, that in the end, in a state of complete befuddlement, she strangles the baby in her charge and, feeling relieved, at last falls sound asleep. The story is a model of terseness, of a truly compact use of most ef- fective artistic means, and can serve as an excellent illustration of the compositional and stylistic devices which underlie Chekhov's mastery as a short-story writer. Before discussing those devices, I should like to touch upon what may appear to be one of the secondary aspects of the story-its por- trayal of the state on the border line between waking and sleeping, as well as its portrayal of dreams. Thoiugh not a story about a dream, dream sequences play an important part in it. Dreams and reality jostle each other, intrude one upon another, merge into one another. There is nothing fantastic about Chekhov's dreams; they are pre- sented rcalistically; and they are used most ingeniously to broaden the story itself, both spatially and temporally. Although the action of the story is set within twenty-four hours and in the narrow confines of a cobbler's dw elling, Chekhov uses the intervening dream sequences as flashbacks, to show the reader Varka's past and her background. Her father's illness and death, her and her mother's long trudge from the native village to the city in search of w ork, when they are reduced to begging for alms on the way-all this is seen through Varka's dreams. I repeat: "Sleepy" is not a dream story, but one feels that in wiriting it Chekhov was very much interested in the portrayal of dreams in lit- erature. I should therefore like to dwell for a while on certain cir- cumstances wvhich I think are related to the genesis of this story. It appears more thanl probable that the idea to wriLe a story in which dreams would play an important part was suggested to Chekhov by a story of his older contemporary, and literary "benefactor," as he once called him, Dmitrii Vasil'evich Grigorovich, published just a year earlier, in January, 1887. Grigorovich was the man who had, in 1885, in- troduced Chekhov to serious literary circles and thus had a considerable influence on his literary career. Grigorovich was sixty-five years old</page><page sequence="3">On Chekhov's Craftsmanship 467 at the time and was looked upon as a venerable literary veteran, one of the very last of the writers who had flourished in the great age of Russian literature, a friend of Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Nekrasov. A writer of much less caliber than these (all except Tol- stoy, who kept away from the literary circles, had died by 1883), Gri- gorovich played in the 1880's the role of the dean of letters in St. Petersburg. His literary heyday had been long left behind; his work written in the 1880's and 1890's attracted little attentio andc is now well-nigh forgotten, including the story which prompted Chekhov. in February, 1887, to write him a long letter. This story, called "Karelin's Dream" and published in the January issue of the monthly review Rtisskaia Mysl', was presented to the read- ers as a fragment from a novel. The novel, however, never material- ized. As for the story, it deserves to be rescued from oblivion, if only because of the interest that Chekhov showed in it; though it is not devoid of interest per se. It is quite a long story, told in the first person by a certain Karelin, a man about town, an habitue of the Petersburg beau monde. Karelin describes his dream, which begins in the streets and squares of St. Petersburg. The leitmotiv of this description is the unbearable cold. There is a curious, somewhat grotesque picture of a funeral encoun- tered by Karelin, the deceased turning out to be a high-ranking civil servant whom Karelin knew a little, and this gives rise to reflections on the vanity of all earthly things. The theme of sharp social con- trasts is also introduced in a description of street sights that is some- what reminiscent of Dostoevsky. There is also a long description, sustained in a satirical tone, of a society party attended the same eve- ning by Karelin (still in his dream). At this party Karelin sees a beau- tiful young lady whom he recognizes as a certain Mary whom he had known in her girlhood and who later made a very unsuitable mar- riage. After this long episode, during which the reader almost forgets that all this is supposed to be happening in a dream, the author re- introduces a note of nightmarish grotesque. After leaving the party, Karelin is driven along the Neva in a strange vehicle, with two odd and silent individuals, their faces hidden in shaggy fur collars, sitting one on either side of him. Karelin has strange, anguished forebodings. Finally, seized by an indescribable terror, he shouts out that he has never harmed anyone or sinned against his own conscience, that he has only voiced his personal opinions about what appeared to him to be mendacity and hypocrisy. Suddenly one of his silent traveling companions speaks out and says in an even voice: "You could have thought so as much as you liked." His cold and polite voice makes Karelin feel chilled to the marrow of his bones. This is followed by an equally strange scene when Kare- lin's vehicle crosses a field intersected by rails along which a train is</page><page sequence="4">468 Slavic Review approaching. Karelin sees an ant crawling towards the rails; he wants to save the ant from the oncoming train but fails. (In some of these details Grigorovich succeeded quite well in conveying the incongruity of the dreams and the dreamer's behavior in them.) Suddenly Karelin sees, through the windows of the train carriage, various society people whom he had just seen at the party. They laugh gaily, and when Karelin inquires the reason of their mirth, they answer: "Because we are a power while you . . . you are an ant." Karelin replies with an impassioned monologue on the true meaning of power and freedom and ends by asking them to set him free. His carriage in the mean- time continues to glide on the snow in absolute darkness, then enters an endless tunnel. Karelin, exhausted, closes his eyes. When he re- opens them the scene is completely changed. He sees himself in a sunny birch copse, and beautiful Mary is coming towards him. This encounter seems to him to be the culmination of his life. She stretches her arms to him, he throws himself at her feet-and wakes up. From the courtyard outside his house comes the monotonous cry of a Tatar rag-and-bones man. Thus ends this story, or rather this fragment from Grigorovich's unwritten novel. Of course, as stories, "Karelin's Dream" and "Sleepy" have nothing in common. It is worth noting, however, that Chekhov became greatly interested in Grigorovich's attempt to give literary expression to a dream. After reading the story he wrote to Grigorovich: . . I am wondering very much to what extent the dream portrayed by you is a dream. It seems to me that the brainwork and the general sensa- tion of the sleeping person have been conveyed by you with remarkable artistry and physiological veracity. Chekhov then goes on to say that since dreaming is a subjective phe- nomenon, every reader will size up Karelin with his own yardstick and every critic must needs approach him subjectively. As for him, his judgment is based on his own dreams, which he sees quite often. He admired Grigorovich's fine portrayal of the sensation of cold: When at night my blanket falls off me, I begin to dream of huge slippery rocks, of cold autumn water, of bare shores-all this indistinct, in a mist, without a scrap of blue sky. Dejected and anguished, as though lost or abandoned, I look at the rocks and somehow feel the inevitability of cross- ing a deep river. At this time I see little river tugs which pull enormous barges, floating logs, rafts, etc. Everything is infinitely stern, melancholy, damp. And when I run away from the river I come across a dilapidated cemetery gate, a funeral of my former school teacher . . . And at this time I am all filled with that peculiar nightmarish chill which is inconceivable in a waking state and can only be experienced by sleepers. It is brought to mind very vividly when one reads the first pages of "Karelin," and espec-</page><page sequence="5">On Chekhov's Craftsmanship 469 ially the top part of page five where the cold and solitude of the grave are evoked. Chekhov then says that whenever he has these "cold" dreams he also dreams of human beings. He disagrees with one of Grigorovich's critics who said that human characters in the story introduced a discordant note. According to Chekhov it is not the human beings as such but their descriptions which "in several places interrupt the picture of the dream." Chekhov continues: ... of people one does dream, and they must be unpleasant. In my case, for instance, the cold sensation in a dream always brings with it a good- looking and learned archpriest who insulted my mother when I was a boy. I dream of wicked, implacable, intriguing, maliciously smiling, vulgar peo- ple, such as you'll never meet in reality. The laughter in the carriage win- dows is a very characteristic symptom of Karelin's nightmare. When in a dream you feel the pressure of evil will, the impending doom caused by that will, you always see something like that laughter.... But when my body gets accustomed to the cold, or someone in the fam- ily covers me up, the sensation of cold, solitude and oppressive evil will gradually disappears. Together with the warmth, I begin to feel as though I were walking on soft carpets or on turf; I see the sun, women, children. . . . The pictures change gradually, but more sharply than in reality, so that on waking up it is difficult to recall the transition from one picture to another... .This sharpness is felt quite well in your story and it intensifies the dream impression. Very conspicuous is also one natural trait noted by you: those who dream express their emotions by fits and starts, in a sharp form, childishly. This is so true! The sleepers weep and cry out much more often than the wak- ing people. Chekhov then says that he liked Grigorovich's story so much that he might write a dozen sheets about it but is afraid that he has noth- ing new or valuable to say, and therefore restrains himself and stops: I shall merely say that your story seems to me magnificent. The public finds it "misty," but for one who writes, who relishes every line, such mists are more transparent than holy water. Hard as I tried I could detect only two unimportant little blemishes in the story, and even that at a pinch: (1) descriptions of characters interrupt the picture of the dream and give the impression of explanatory notices which are affixed to trees in gardens by learned gardeners and spoil the landscape; and (2) at the beginning of the story the sensation of the cold is somewhat blunted in the reader and becomes a habit through the frequent repetition of the word "cold" (XIII, 279-81). In conclusion Chekhov even applied to Grigorovich's story the word "brilliant." Grigorovich was both pleased and surprised by Chekhov's reaction to his story, and in thanking him for his letter said that he wasn't</page><page sequence="6">470 Slavic Review spoiled by such compliments. At the same time he admitted quite frankly that he was least of all concerned with that which Chekhov liked most in the story. A true portrayal of the process of dreaming as such and its impressions occupied me incomparably less than the idea of giving the outward and social picture of a certain milieu in Petersburg-of expressing the dissatis- faction, the boredom with the surrounding falsehood and vacuity, and of resolving this nightmare with a conciliatory bright impression. The epi- sodic characters and their descriptions detract perhaps from the harmony and wholeness of the story, but without them my object of creating a pain- ful impression would not have been attained, and this is what I was pri- marily concerned with. In our profession is it not, however, often the case that that about which one bothers comes out weakest of all, while that which has been sung unconsciously, like a bird sings, comes off best? You nust have experienced this yourself more than once.3 This exchange of letters is interesting and symptomatic. Chekhov ignored the social-satirical element in Grigorovich's story, although for the author himself it was its raison d'etre, and was fascinated by what for the author was of secondary importance, a means to an end-the portrayal of a dream. This may not have been Chekhov's experience in his early period but a year later, in 1889, he gratefully noted that G-rigorovich was the only one who had appreciated his description of the first snowfall in the story "A Nervous Breakdown." This is, of course, characteristic of Chekhov-this attention to impressionistic de- tail in a story which the public and the critics saw first of all as a problem story on the theme of prostitution. But what this exchange of letters reveals also is Chekhov's interest in dreams and their portrayal in literature. The late Aleksei Remi- zov, whose own work often was a retelling of dreams and who wrote so interestingly about dreams in Russian literature, once said that Chekhov apparently neither had dreams nor ever portrayed them. This seems to have been a rash statement. That Chekhov had dreams, that he was interested in their physiology, in the relation between dream and reality, is demonstrated beyond all doubt by his letter to Grigoro- vich; it was not often that Chekhov reacted so enthusiastically and spontaneously to another writer's work. Given that interest, it is easy to imagine that sooner or later Chekhov himself would try to intro- duce dream experience into a story. This he did in "Sleepy." The two stories are, of course, quite unlike. There are less than six pages in "Sleepy" as against Grigorovich's thirty. There are no social-satirical and philosophical digressions which, as Chekhov rightly pointed out, interfere with Grigorovich's narrative and, one may add, weaken its dreamlike quality. And yet, whatever was the source of Chekhov's little gem of a story (social-minded critics often juxtapose it with an- 3 C0OO, II, 204-5.</page><page sequence="7">On Chekhov's Craftsmanship 471 other-and much more sentimental one-"Vanka," as being on the same theme of cruel exploitation of child labor), it is tempting to think that when Chekhov sat down to write it he remembered Gri- gorovich's attempt to give literary expression to dream sensations, and his own comments upon it, and decided to try his hand at this sort of thing, doing it, of course, in his own way. Little Varka's dreams which are worked into the texture of the story illustrate some of Che- khov's observations in his letter to Grigorovich. Consciously or not, Chekhov was giving Grigorovich an object lesson in the portrayal of dreams in literature. As Varka falls asleep while rocking the cradle in which the baby cries, she sees dark clouds that chase one another and cry like the baby. Then the wind blows, the clouds disappear and Varka sees a wide highway covered with watery mud. On the high- way, wagon trains stretch, people with bundles on their backs drag them- selves along, shadows of sorts flit back and forth; on both sides, through the cold, raw fog, forests can be seen. Suddenly the people with bundles and the shadows fall on the ground into the watery mud. "Why is this?" asks Varka. "To sleep, to sleep," they answer her. And they fall asleep soundly; they sleep sweetly while on the telegraph wires crows and magpies sit, shrilling like the baby and trying to wake her. Some details here-the cold, raw fog, the watery mud, the dark clouds-recall both Grigorovich's story and Chekhov's letter about his own dreams. Then Varka relives, in her dream, the sad day when her father wNas taken ill and was removed at night to the nearby county hospital; and the next morning when her mother went to inquire about him and returned with the news of his death. Varka goes into the woods and cries there, but suddenly someone hits her on the back of her head with such force that she bangs her forehead against a birch tree. This is a transition from the dream to the grim reality; the birch is still part of the dream, but the knock on the head is reality intrud- ing upon the dream: She raises her eyes and sees her master, the cobbler, standing before her. "What do you think you're doing, you mangy brat?" he says. "The child is crying and you're asleep?" He jerks her painfully by the ear, and she tosses her head, rocks the cradle, and purrs her song... When she falls asleep again she once more sees, in her dream, the highway covered with watery mud: . . . the people with bundles on their backs and the shadows have stretched out and are sound asleep. Looking at them Varka feels a passionate long- ing for sleep: what a joy it would be for her to lie down, but her mother</page><page sequence="8">472 Slavic Review Pelageia is walking beside her and urging her on. They are both hurrying to town to look for work. Not long before Chekhov wrote his story, he praised very highly, in a letter to Vladimir Galaktionovich Korolenko, the latter's story "The Sokolinian." It was, he said, written like a good musical composition, according to all those rules which are suggested to the artist by his instinct.4 Coming from Chekhov, this was a great compliment. His own short stories, including "Sleepy," certainly have the qualities of good musical compositions. If closely analyzed, "Sleepy" can be easily broken up into musical phrases. Recurring images and verbal for- mulas play an important part. The story begins with a masterly de- scription-brief and yet pregnant-of the setting. Small realistic details, emphasized by very short sentences (in Russian some of them consist of one or two words) alternate with those impressionistic brush strokes which Tolstoy had in mind when he said: Chekhov as an artist cannot even be compared with previous Russian writ- ers-with Turgenev, Dostoevsky, or myself. Chekhov has his own peculiar manner, like the Impressionists. You look and it is as though the man were indiscriminately dabbing on whatever paints came to his hand, and these brush strokes seem to be quite unrelated to each other. But you move some distance away, you look, and you get on the whole an integrated impression. You have, before you, a bright, irresistible picture of nature.5 Tolstoy may have thought, in the first place, of Chekhov's descrip- tions of nature (and in this connection one recalls that Chekhov re- garded Turgenev's famous, much-vaunted descriptions as old-fashioned, and said that something new was needed). But those words of Tolstoy are applicable to Chekhov's manner, to his technique, in general. Here is the beginning of "Sleepy": It is night. Nursemaid Varka, a girl of about thirteen, is rocking a cradle, in which a baby lies, and barely audibly purring: "Rockabye, baby, In the treetop..." Before the ikon a green light is burning; across the room, from corner to corner, stretches a line on which hang diapers and a pair of roomy black trousers. The ikon light throws a large green patch on the ceiling and the trousers cast long shadows on the stove, on the cradle, on Varka. When the light begins to flicker, the patch and the shadows come to life and are set in motion as though by a wind. It is stuffy. There is a smell of cabbage soup and cobbler's ware. The baby is shrilling... One should note here the passage about the green patch and the 4 eXoBB, HoAnoe co6panue . . ., XIV, 12. 5 Quoted in 10. Co60oeB, UIeXoo (Moscow, 1930), p. 59.</page><page sequence="9">On Chekhov's Craftsmanship 473 shadows coming to life. In Chekhov's stories of this period (a good example is "The Post," one of the most "Chekhovian" of Chekhov's short stories) we often find inanimate objects animated. Later Che- khov was to reproach Gorky for his anthropomorphic excesses (Gorky's famous "The sea was laughing..." in "Malva"). However, what Che- khov protested against was Gorky's pointless, gratuitous anthropomor- phism-anthropomorphism for its own sake. In Chekhov's stories these animated objects have their own compositional and stylistic functions to perform, and in "Sleepy" the green patch and the shadows return again and again and play an important part. They serve as musical refrains and at the same time form part of Varka's sleepy obsession, of her hallucination. The ikon light flickers. The green patch and the shadows are set in mo- tion, they force their way into Varka's half-open, staring eyes, and in her half-dormant brain form into hazy dreams. She sees dark clouds which chase each other across the sky and shrill like the baby. When her employer hits her for dozing instead of minding the baby she tosses her head, and .. . the green patch and the shadows from the trousers and diapers waver, wink at her, and soon again take possession of her brain. One important detail here can be easily lost in translation. In Rus- sian the verbs "to flicker" or "blink" (of the light) and "to wink" are closely related. So when Chekhov speaks of the green light flickering and the green patch winking at Varka he uses different forms of the same Russian verb. It is a surprisingly modern device that we con- stantly find in Chekhov. One of the Russian Chekhov students called it "verbal suggestion."6 Another striking example of it in "Sleepy" is Varka's dream that she and her mother are begging for alms on the road: here the words "Give us . . ." are echoed by the mistress's angry command to give her the baby. Its function here is dual, however, for it also serves as a link between dream and reality. Another recurrent image is the cricket which chirps in the stove, its chirping becoming in Varka's sleepy, befuddled mind identified with the crying of the baby. Here in translating the story into Eng- lish one must at all cost find one verb which will do both for the cry- ing of the baby and the sound produced by the cricket; that is why I have used the verb "to shrill." The same verb is used before for the cawing of crows and magpies, which is also a link connecting the dreamn with the crying of the baby. Just before the story ends, those images -the green patch, the shadows, and the cricket-return in combination: 6 II. BHurJI.mZ, &lt;&lt;TaopuecTno QTeXOa.

The green patch and the shadows from the trousers and diapers on the ceiling force their way into Varka's half- open eyes, flicker and befuddle her brain. "Rockabye, baby," she purrs. And the baby shrills and is exhausted with shrilling. Varka again sees the muddy highway, the people with bundles, Pelageia, her father Efim... The description of Varka's pastime between the morning, when the baby is fed, and the next evenin-g, when she goes back to her noc- turnal watch over it, is also musically organized with the aid of curt staccato orders which progress crescendo and punctuate the narrative into a series of brief realistic descriptions of Varka's typically dreary and exhausting day: "Varka, light the stove!" "Varka, get the samno- var ready!" "Varka, clean the master's overshoes!" "Varka, wash the staircase outside!" "Varka, get the samovar ready!" "Varka, run and buy three bottles of beer!" "Varka, run for some vodka! Varka, where is the corkscrew? Varka, clean the herring!" Without describing the life of Varka's employers, Chekhov gives us a complete picture of their daily routine. Note the double order for the samovar. The final order is: "Varka, rock the baby!" The story has come round full circle; it has returned to its initial point: the last order can easily be imagined as preceding the beginning of the story. The circle begins to repeat itself: In the stove the cricket shrills. The green patch and the shadows on the ceiling from the trousers and diapers again force their way into Varka's half-open eyes, flicker and befuddle her brain. "Rockabye, baby, In the treetop," she purrs. And the baby shrills and is exhausted with shrilling. Varka again sees the muddy highway, the people with bundles, Pelageia, her father Efim. But this time the vicious circle is broken. Chekhov has in store for us one of his most effective and dramatic surprise endings. About a dozen lines are given to the preparation and motivation of the de- nouement: She [Varka] understands everything, she recognizes everyone, but through her dozing she just cannot understand this force which shackles her hand and foot, weighs down on her, and interferes with her life. She turns round, looks for this force in order to rid herself of it, but cannot find it. At last, exhausted, she strains all her strength and vision, looks up at the blinking (flickering) green patch and, after listening intently to the shrilling, finds the enemy that interferes with her life. That enemy is the child. She laughs. She is surprised. How is it that until now she could not understand such a simple thing? The green patch, the shadows and the cricket, too, seem to laugh and to be surprised. A false notion takes hold of Varka. She gets up from her stool and, smil- ing a wide smile, without blinking her eyes, walks about the room. She is</page><page sequence="11">On Chekhov's Craftsmanship 475 pleasantly tickled by the thought that presently she will be rid of the baby which shackles her hand and foot... To kill the baby and then sleep, sleep, sleep ... These words "sleep, sleep, sleep" very effectively echo the answer which the people with bundles and shadows give to Varka's question at the beginning of her dream. There is, perhaps, in this passage just one false note: the sentence about "false notion" seems superfluous, un-Chekhovian. On the other hand, one should not, perhaps, trans- late it that way; Chekhov may have used this expression instead of the medical term "hallucination." The denouement itself is quite short. Its dispassionate terseness and finality contrasts with some of the endings in earlier stories of this middle period, which are either overmuffled or not free from a some- what obtrusive didacticism (e.g., in the story "The Enemies," 1887, otherwise a most effective story on the subject of mutual unintelligi- bility and isolation of human beings). In the final paragraph of the story the green patch and the shadows which, as we have just seen, seemed to share Varka's joyful surprise, reappear again, acquiring a new significance (and remember what has been said about the near-identity of the verbs "to flicker" and "to wink" in Russian): Laughing, winking at the green patch and shaking her fingers at it, Varka steals up to the cradle and bends over the baby. Having strangled it, she quickly lies down on the floor, laughing with joy now that she can sleep, and a minute later is sleeping already as soundly as if she were dead. This ending is the very limit of the detachment which Chekhov prized so highly in a writer, and which made Mikhailovsky so indig- nant (in referring to the callous indifference with which Chekhov chose his subjects, he mentioned, among other stories, "Sleepy").7 It is strange to think now that in the story as printed originally in the newspaper the last sentence ("Having strangled, etc.") was absent. It occurs first in the version-otherwise almost unrevised-included in the volume Khmurye liudi (1890).8 Whether the sentence was an after- thought, or whether Chekhov had it in mind from the very outset but had decided to spare the susceptibilities of the readers of the Pet- ersburg Gazette, we do not know; its manuscript does not seem to have 7See HI.

In his artistic detachment Chekhov is closer to Pushkin than to any other writer in Russian literature. It is interesting to note that Pasternak's protagonist in Doctor Zhivago brings the two names together when he writes in his diary: "What I have come to like best in the whole of Russian literature is the childlike Russian quality of Pushkin and Chekhov, their modest reticence in such high-sounding matters as the ultimate purpose of mankind or their own salvation. It isn't that they didn't think about these things, and to good effect, but to talk about such things seemed to them pretentious, pre- sumptuous."

There exists also a remote possibility that this final sentence was struck out by the editor, but if this had been the case it would probably have become known. Although Chekhov sometimes attained excellent effects by leaving things unsaid (this was part of his "Impressionism"), it seems to me that here, by spelling things out, he enhanced the effect of the story, without making it in the least melo- dramatic. "Sleepy" is said to have been very highly regarded by Leo Tolstoy. It is certainly a very good confirmation of Tolstoy's opinion of Che- khov as an impressionist artist.9 It may be worth mentioning that Chekhov's impressionism was noted, even before Tolstoy, by the same Grigorovich, though he did not use the word; in one of his letters to Chekhov he discussed Chekhov's impressionistic technique in the story "Agaf'ia." The same impressionistic technique is skillfully and effec- tively applied by Chekhov in a number of stories written between 1886 and 1889, in which pictures gradually acquire breadth and depth as a result of similar brush strokes, seemingly laid at random but actually contrived very cleverly. To name only two, such stories as "The Post" and "Typhus," which usually are not considered among Chekhov's best, would repay a close compositional and stylistic analysis in this light. Such an analysis would confirm the impression of Chekhov's exquisite mastery even in this early middle period. There is much to be said for preferring those stories, and certainly "Sleepy," to such more famous ones as "A Dreary Story," "The Duel," or "Ward No. 6." 9 Chekhov's place in Russian literature as an impressionist is discussed pertinently by Professor D. Tschizhewsky in the same volume in which my paper on Chekhov and Grigoro- vich was published ("Vber die Stellung cechovs innerhalb der russischen Literaturentwick- lung," in Anton Chekhov: 1860-1960, pp. 293-310).</page></plain_text>
