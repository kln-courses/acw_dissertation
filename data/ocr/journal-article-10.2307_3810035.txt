<plain_text><page sequence="1">Deep Ecology versus Ecofeminism: Healthy Differences or Incompatible Philosophies? ROBERT SESSIONS Deep ecology and ecofeminism are contemporary environmental philosophies that share the desire to supplant the predominant Western anthropocentric environmental frameworks. Recently thinkers from these movements have focused their critiques on each other, and substantial differences have emerged. This essay explores central aspects of this debate to ascertain whether either philosophy has been undermined in the process and whether there are any indications that they are compatible despite their differences. INTRODUCTION One measure of the strength and importance of the feminist movement is the extent to which philosophers from a broad spectrum-from conservatives to radicals or from historians of ancient philosophy to deconstructionists- now see the discussion of gender issues as an important part of their discipline. Using a parallel yardstick, the environmental movement has grown rapidly in strength and importance: the range of philosophers who address environmen- tal issues is probably as broad as that discussing gender. Given this rapid and dramatic rise of philosophical concern for environmental issues, we should expect and welcome serious disagreements about both the underlying concep- tual and historical reasons for human destruction of the environment and the proposed solutions. In this essay I will focus on the debate between deep ecology and ecofeminism, two of the several philosophies that criticize and attempt to supplant the prevailing environmental philosophies. The controversy between deep ecology and ecofeminism has been going on for nearly a decade.1 On the positive side, many thinkers from these two camps have helped each other Hypatia vol. 6, no. 1 (Spring 1991) ? by Robert Sessions</page><page sequence="2">Robert Sessions understand better their own views and those they oppose, and they have deepened their own and our understanding of the difficult issues we face. In contrast, some of the exchanges have been rather rancorous: some deep ecologists have accused ecofeminism of shallowness, anthropocentrism, short sightedness, and environmental naivete, while various ecofeminists have called their accusers sexist, shallow, ahistorical, stoical, and even fascist. In this essay I will attempt to show how and why deep ecology and ecofeminism are at odds, and I will examine whether and how these differences could be overcome. I will conclude with a discussion of the key issues and differences that I believe need further attention if the "versus" in the title of this essay is to be replaced by a more compatible relationship. DEEP ECOLOGY According to Ame Naess, who coined the "deep ecology" label and who is looked upon by most deep ecologists as a seminal thinker in this tradition, deep ecology has eight basic characteristics, the first four of which he claims are conceptually fundamental: "(1) The well-being and flourishing of human and non-human Life on Earth have value in themselves. These values are inde- pendent of the usefulness of the non-human world for human purposes. (2) Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves. (3) Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs. (4) The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of non-human life requires such a decrease" (Naess 1986, 14). Naess and the many deep ecologists who agree with him begin by asserting the fundamental equality and inherent value of all beings and then draw inferences for human action from their original anti-anthropomorphism. Warwick Fox sums up deep ecology as wanting to encourage an egalitarian attitude that "within obvious kinds of practical limits, allows entities (includ- ing humans) the freedom to unfold in their own way unhindered by the various forms of human domination" (Fox 1989, 6). This central concern with "ecocentric egalitarianism" (Fox's label) leads deep ecologists to oppose, above all else, the historical Western propensity to place humans at the center of the moral universe (to be anthropocentric). Deep ecologists trace most environmental destruction to the anthropocentric attitude that says (1) nonhuman nature has no value in itself, (2) humans (and/or God, if theistic) create what value there is, and (3) humans have the right (some would say the obligation) to do as they please with and in the nonhuman world as long as they do not harm other humans' interests. Thus deep ecologists criticize the human centeredness of prevailing Western attitudes and ethics by claiming that there are no good reasons in general for valuing a member of a species or a whole species over another individual or species or over any given ecosystem. They are not against 91</page><page sequence="3">Hypatia human flourishing, but deep ecologists believe that this flourishing can generally occur without the destructive domination of nonhuman nature by humans, and insofar as it can, it should. Naess and other deep ecologists believe we need an ethic that is not a mere extension of existing humanist ethics. Animal liberationist Peter Singer, for example, argues that we can provide a theoretical basis for vegetarianism by extending utilitarianism to include all sentient beings. Deep ecologists criticize Singer and other "extensionists" for holding onto "an increasingly arbitrary perspective in an age when the ecological imagination can shift reference points within the system and imagine the world to some extent from the standpoint of the muskrat and its environment" (Naess 1973, 96). Extensions of human-centered ethics perpetuate an unjustifiable bias humans have toward their own. Thus, just as an ethic that begins with men as distinct from women is sexist, utilitarianism (the best of the humanistic lot in this regard) and other Western ethics are "speciesist." Deep ecology tries to begin with a foundation that does not arbitrarily set "man apart" (to borrow a phrase from Robinson Jeffers). Hans Jonas puts the difference between shallow and deep ecology this way: "Only an ethic which is grounded in the breadth of being, not merely in the singularity or oddness of man, can have significance in the scheme of things" (Jonas 1983, 284). The critical side of deep ecology, then, is aimed at anthropocentric domina- tion of nature. The alternatives to anthropocentrism it recommends vary, depending on the non-domination-of-nature tradition(s) to which particular deep ecologists turn.2 We will look at some of these frameworks briefly at the end of this essay; for now three points are important. First, given the very general nature of the change in attitude deep ecologists desire-from anthropomorphism to egalitarianism-we find greater diversity in the prescriptions given by deep ecologists to solve the problems caused by anthropocentric philosophies and practices than in the diagnosis of the sources of the problems. Deep ecologists are more unified in their analyses of the problem than in their recommended solutions. Second, while no specific prescription necessarily follows from the diagnosis, a type of alternative is demanded- one that eliminates anthropocentric domination. Finally, while the alternatives offered by deep ecologists are fairly diverse, they tend to be characterized as proposing that we seek a higher unity in the diversity of the world: for example, Naess often turns to Buddhism for a higher Self that transcends the ego-self of the individual; Fox talks of the transpersonal; and Devall and Sessions look to the unity of Spinoza's philosophy (see note 2). When we examine the disputes between deep ecology and ecofeminism, it is crucial to separate their critiques of anthropocentric and androcentric environmental frameworks from their positive alternatives, for disapproval of one or several (or even all?) of deep ecology's positive frameworks is not to dismiss that movement's analysis of the domination of nature. On the other 92</page><page sequence="4">Robert Sessions side, a dismissal of antianthropocentrism is to reject deep ecology. I hope to show that ecofeminism at most modifies (in important ways) deep ecology's negative analysis, and that while the tendency of ecofeminist solutions is perhaps contrary to the standard interpretations of deep ecology's images of unity, they are not logically incompatible with the negative side of the deep ecological framework, and they may not be incompatible with certain versions of the positive side either. ECOFEMINISM Finding a spokesperson for ecofeminism is more difficult, and this difference from deep ecology is not insignificant. While both men and women are to be found within each of these varieties of environmental philosophy, most deep ecologists are men, while women make up the strong majority in ecofeminism (see note 1). Part of the ecofeminist critique of deep ecology is that the masculinist nature of deep ecology can be seen in its rather unified program as well as in its use of language and logical style. I will return to this issue briefly at the end of this essay; for now bear in mind that the diversity of thought seems much greater in ecofeminism than in deep ecology. As a starting point I will use Ynestra King and Karen Warren as examplars of ecofeminist thought: they have both written a number of influential articles on ecofeminism, and they both identify strongly with this movement, as illustrated by their ardent defenses of ecofeminism against feminist as well as deep ecologist critics. Warren says that ecofeminism is based on the following general claims: "(1) There are important connections between the oppression of women and the oppression of nature. (2) Understanding the nature of these connections is necessary to any adequate understanding of the oppression of women and the oppression of nature. (3) Feminist theory and practice must include an ecologi- cal perspective. (4) Solutions to ecological problems must include a feminist perspective" (Warren 1987, 4-5). She further contends that what feminism today needs is to be "transformative," to move beyond the current debate over the four leading versions of feminism (liberal feminism, traditional Marxist feminism, radical feminism, and socialist feminism) "and make an ecofeminist perspective central to feminist theory and practice" (1987, 5). Ecofeminism contains both a critique of the dominant "patriarchal conceptual framework" and offers a feminist frame work that is "grounded in familiar ecological principles." The former, according to Warren, is one which takes traditionally male-identified beliefs, values, attitudes, and assumptions as ... the standard; it gives higher status or prestige to what has been traditionally identified as "male" than to what has been traditionally identified as "female".... A patriarchal conceptual framework is charac- 93</page><page sequence="5">Hypatia terized by value-hierarchical thinking.... Such ... thinking gives rise to a logic of domination... which serves to legitimate inequality when, in fact, prior to the metaphor of Up-Down one would have said only that there existed diversity. (1987, 6-7) For Warren, the ecofeminist critique of patriarchy is grounded in ecological principles: "Everything is interconnected with everything else; all parts of an ecosystem have equal value; there is no free lunch; 'nature knows best'; healthy, balanced ecosystems must maintain diversity; there is unity in diversity" (1987, 7). Warren believes this critique must embrace feminism because otherwise "the ecological movement will fail to make the conceptual connections between the oppression of women and the oppression of nature (and to link these with other systems of oppression)" (1987, 8). Warren sharpens this analysis in a recent article (1990) by showing the parallel structures between the domination of nature by humans and the domination of women by men. Her version of the logic of the domination of nature (anthropocentrism) has five steps: (Al) Humans do, and plants and rocks do not, have the capacity to consciously and radically change the community in which they live. (A2) Whatever has the capacity to consciously and radically change the community in which it lives is morally superior to whatever lacks this capacity. (A3) Thus, humans are morally superior to plants and rocks. (A4) For any X and Y, if X is morally superior to Y, then X is morally justified in subordinating Y. (A5) Thus, humans are morally justified in subordinating plants and rocks. (Warren 1990, 129) Warren next shows how women can be (and have been) substituted for plants and rocks in this argument and how women are identified with nature and men with mind. Thus (Al) becomes (Bl): "Women are identified with nature and the realm of the physical; men are identified with the 'human' and the realm of the mental" (1990, 130). She goes on to argue that the second and fourth premises are unwarranted value assumptions and that without them the arguments for domination of nature and women fail. Warren contends that this ecofeminist analysis not only exposes and successfully criticizes the domination of nature but also shows that the same logic is used to dominate women. Therefore, she argues, feminism is (should be) ecological (against naturism), and those who oppose naturism are (should be) simultaneously against sexism. King emphasizes a further dimension of ecofeminism by showing that ecofeminism is naturally closely aligned with the peace movement and other 94</page><page sequence="6">Robert Sessions struggles to end domination of people as well as nature. In a classic essay (1981) she calls ecofeminism "cultural feminism," which rejects both the denial of the nature/woman link (rationalist feminism) and the belief that women are more "natural" than men (radical feminism). King claims that "both these positions are unwittingly complicit with the nature/culture dualism. Women's oppression is neither strictly historical nor strictly biological. It is both" (King 1981, 13). Moreover, King believes that gender is a meaningful part of a person's identity.... As women we are naturalized culture in a culture defined against nature. If the nature/culture antagonism is the primary contradiction of our time, it is also what weds feminism and ecology and makes women the historic subject. Without an ecological perspective which asserts the interdependence of living things, feminism is disembodied. (1981, 15) Ecofeminism's critique of predominant Western environmental attitudes is at least in part quite like that of deep ecology: the central fault is an attitude, logic, and practice of dominating nature. Deep ecology's anthropocentrism and Warren's naturism appear to be the same. The central difference between their negative analyses seems to be that while deep ecology focuses exclusively on human domination of nature, ecofeminism insists that a proper analysis must also emphasize the intimate logical and historical connections between the various forms of domination-the same logic and attitudes of superiority and practices of domination humans (men?) display in their relations toward the nonhuman dimensions of the world are found in men's relations to women and in imperialistic, racist, and classist structures and practices. Some ecofeminists claim that deep ecologists reveal their male chauvinism when they at most allude to the connections among these various forms of domination, and they emphasize the deeply masculinist nature of all these interconnected forms of domination by proposing that the central problem is androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism.3 THE CONFLICT BETWEEN DEEP ECOLOGY AND ECOFEMINISM In this section I will address this central ecofeminist criticism of deep ecology that it is androcentric. I will also examine the counterclaims by some deep ecologists that ecofeminism is shallow-that it does not get to the heart of environmental issues because it focuses on the connections among the various forms of domination rather than on the domination of nature itself. At the core of deep ecology is the call for a new (or the return to an old) sensibility. Modem humans have lost touch with nature and thus with their own natures-we no longer feel the rhythms of nature within ourselves, we have split ourselves from the world (dualism), and we live at a distance 95</page><page sequence="7">Hypatia (alienation) from what is natural, leaving us fearful (insecure) and able to deal with the world only on our own terms (control). We have become insensitive to ourselves and others by losing our natural sensibilities. Deep ecologists thus look to premodem and/or holistic traditions for suggestions about how to experience the world-to American Indians, Buddhism, Spinoza and others (see note 2), or to the science of ecology. 4 In short, their critique focuses on the bifurcation of humans and nature that has its sources far back especially in Western history and deep within many inherited philosophies, and the basic strategy deep ecologists recommend for ending the domination of nature is to somehow reverse this dualism, to join together what humans have split asunder. As we have seen, ecofeminists agree that domination of nature is much the issue, and many of them would further agree that historically the dualism of humans and nature is a major part of the mental substructure undergirding that domination. But they would not agree that this is the whole story. Warren, for example, says that "deep ecology makes a big conceptual error in supposing that the way to reduce a bad dualism is to affirm the neglected or historically undervalued member of the pair! The bad dualism is the problem, not simply what got undervalued."5 She raises a parallel challenge to radical feminism, which wants to frame "the feminist debate over ecology in terms of the question 'Are women closer to nature than men?' In order for the question to be meaningfully raised, one must presuppose the legitimacy of the nature-cul- ture dualism" (Warren 1987, 15). Ecofeminists such as Warren are concerned that nature has become a disconnected abstraction (and in some cases an obsession) for deep ecologists, with the result that although they are devoted to "nature," they relate to nature in a way parallel to that of the dualists they oppose-nature is a lost part of one's self (or one's self is a lost part of nature) that needs to be rejoined. Jim Cheney puts it this way: In discussing naturalism, it is natural and to a large extent unavoidable to rely on the familiar terminology of philosophi- cal tradition to explain it. Since a considerable amount of that terminology is the product of dualism, the question arises as to whether this language can be used effectively to convey the different perspective of naturalism. Although philosophy has always involved a great deal of innovation in new terminology, the defenders of ordinary language argue that philosophical meaning can be adequately expressed in everyday terms. But what if the ordinary view of the world which is embedded in ordinary language is what one wants to avoid and wants to correct? (Cheney 1987, 111) Throughout his article Cheney tries to paint a different picture of how we might conceive of our relationships with humans and nonhumans alike. He 96</page><page sequence="8">Robert Sessions turns for his inspiration to the rich material to be found in recent feminist literature about friendship, love, care, and gifting.6 Cheney believes deep ecologists reveal their ties to the patriarchal traditions they are trying to overcome by the sources and images they use for "reversing" the bifurcation of culture and nature. Despite its sincere concerns, deep ecology remains androcentric, and androcentrism is the real culprit. Thus deep ecology does not, according to this ecofeminist criticism, transcend the perspective it criticizes. While there are intimate ties between analysis and solution, let us begin sorting out this dispute by differentiating deep ecology's diagnosis from its prescriptions to see just where and how ecofeminists find deep ecology lacking. Warren's analysis of the logic of domination concentrates on the diagnosis, while Cheney's alternative to deep ecology's images of unity is concerned mainly with prescriptions. At first glance Warren's analysis seems to add to or extend the basic critical analysis of deep ecology. Warwick Fox quotes "one ecofeminist-cum-deep ecologist" who read Warren's 1987 article and wondered "why she doesn't just call it [Warren's transformative feminism] deep ecology?" (Fox 1989, 14). For what Warren does, says Fox, is to show that the logic of domination that deep ecology sees as the source of naturism has its parallels in sexism, racism, and classism. According to Fox, anthropomorphism is what deep ecologists call this logic and attitude ("ideology") in human/na- ture relationships (Fox 1989, 19). He further contends that deep ecologists encourage an attitude of egalitarianism "toward all entities in the ecosphere- including humans" (1989, 21). Moreover, deep ecologists "completely agree with ecofeminists that men have been far more implicated in the history of ecological destruction than women. However, deep ecologists also agree with similar charges derived from other social perspectives: for example, that capitalists, whites, and Westerners have been far more implicated in the history of ecological destruction than pre-capitalist peoples, blacks, and non- Westerners" (1989, 14). Human centeredness, not a particular group of humans, is the target of deep ecology; thus, Fox claims that contrary to Cheney and other ecofeminists, deep ecologists are not androcentric. Is Fox correct in his contention that the crucial difference between deep ecology and ecofeminism is a matter of focus-that deep ecology has its eye on environmental relations while ecofeminism is more concerned with how the logic of domination is also played out on women? Not according to Warren. She believes that the gendered nature of the logic of domination is more than an accident of history. She believes that feminism should be ecological at its core because the domination of nature and the domination of women are parts of a whole, and she believes that any satisfactory environmental philosophy must be feminist for the same reasons. She gives three arguments for the latter claim: (1) for the sake of historical accuracy we must "acknowledge the feminization of nature and the naturalization of women as part of the exploita- 97</page><page sequence="9">Hypatia tion of nature"; (2) the oppressive dual dominations of women and nature at least in the West are "located in [a] patriarchal conceptual framework," and to ignore this connection is to give, at best, "an incomplete, inaccurate, and partial account of what is required of a conceptually adequate environmental ethic"; and (3) at least in contemporary culture the word feminist helps to clarify how the domination and liberation of nature are conceptually linked to patriarchy and its demise. Warren adds that "without the addition of the word 'feminist,' one presents environmental ethics as if it has no bias, including male-gender bias, which is just what ecofeminists deny: failure to notice the connections between the twin oppressions of women and nature is male-gender bias" (Warren 1990, 144). This exchange between Fox and Warren, who are in many ways quite close in their concerns and analyses, helps to pinpoint what seems to be a critical difference between ecofeminism and deep ecology with regard to their diag- noses of the philosophical sources of environmental destructiveness. Warren and Cheney talk about this difference by emphasizing that the logic of domination is accompanied by a set of values: The third feature of oppressive conceptual frameworks is the most significant. A logic of domination is not just a logical structure. It also involves a substantive value system, since an ethical premise is needed to permit or sanction the "just" subordination of that which is subordinate. (Warren 1990, 128) According to this ecofeminist criticism, Fox, like Naess and other deep ecologists, emphasizes an abstract equality between humans and all other beings, while ecofeminism is against the logic of domination and the particular historical values that result in the domination of a particular set of entities. Fox defends deep ecology against this line of criticism by arguing that anthropocentrism is the most "fundamental kind of legitimation" that has been used to justify domination, whether of nature, of women, or of particular groups of people or nonhumans (Fox 1989, 21-25). He believes that "these classes of social actors have not sought to legitimate their positions on the grounds that they are, for example, men, capitalists, white or Western per se, but on the grounds that they have most exemplified whatever it is that has been taken to constitute the essence of humanness .... [They] have ... habitually assumed themselves to be somehow more fully human than others, such as women, the 'lower' classes, blacks, and non-Westerners" (1989, 22). Fox further defends deep ecology as non-sexist by pointing out that ecofeminists can be guilty of overemphasizing the domination of women and its link to the domination of nature. Since the logic of human centeredness can be used to justify domination of anything or anyone deemed lacking the magic essence, why don't ecofeminists give equal weight to the domination of people of color, aboriginal people, or poor people? In Fox's view: 98</page><page sequence="10">Robert Sessions There appears to be two reasons for this. First, to do so would detract from the priority that ecofeminists wish to give to their own concern with androcentrism. Second, and more sig- nificantly, these charges could also be applied with equal force to the ecofeminist focus on androcentrism itself. (Fox 1989, 14) At the very least, this exchange and others like it in the literature serve to warn us to be careful to understand these philosophies before criticizing them; but such debates also highlight that the process of exchange itself is formative of the positions. Given these caveats, what are we to make of the current exchange? Is deep ecology sexist? Is deep ecology's analysis fundamental? Is ecofeminism "simplistic on both empirical and logical grounds" (Fox 1989, 15)? My answers to these questions will in certain ways support both contingents. First, I think that Warren's analysis of the logic of domination shows that at least one ecofeminist understands clearly that what Fox calls "human centeredness" is the problem: the logical strategy is to place some person(s) in domination over other persons or entities based on the in-group possessing a special quality exclusively or more fully than the others. Thus I do not see that Fox levels a telling criticism of ecofeminism by insisting that anthropocentrism is fundamental; ecofeminists don't disagree, as far as that logical point goes. Second, while it is important to understand the logic of domination, it is also important to understand how, where, and on what it has been used. To simply insist that the logic of anthropomorphism is the problem is like criticizing technology for extending human control over nature without looking at which technologies are used in which ways to do what for or to whom. Furthermore, just as uses of technologies can be good or bad, not all forms of domination are bad, and not all bad forms are equally bad. To ignore the particular uses of the logic of domination is to be guilty of ahistorical and possibly essentialist philosophizing. Thus it is no accident that the characteristics of ecofeminism given by Warren emphasize context and process. Third, the supposed sexism of deep ecology is no simple matter. Fox and others are quite emphatic that the scope of their ecocentric egalitarianism includes all humans as well as nonhumans. In theory, they are not androcentric or misogynistic. Is this a situation where, as Warren claims, not to be for us is to be against us? Fox does not think so-he sees nothing in the logic or values of deep ecologists that precludes them from being concerned about sexism. But that is not the same as being actively concerned about the actual victims of dominance, nor is it to be sensitive to the particular uses to which the logic of domination has been put. Deep ecologists perhaps do not deserve to be put into the same camp as those who practice the logic of domination on women, but they are guilty of complicity if they do not recognize the particular dominations of the day and work to alleviate them at least by revealing the common logic and values of sexism and naturism. 99</page><page sequence="11">Hypatia In summary, while I can see why a deep ecologist might wonder why Warren does not call herself a deep ecologist since she begins with the logic of domination, at least with regard to the negative analysis of naturism I think one could as easily wonder why deep ecologists like Fox don't call themselves ecofeminists. For ecofeminism not only comprehends the problem of anthropocentrism, but adds the crucial dimension of history- the actual ways in which the logic of domination has been used against particular beings and systems. A central tenet of ecofeminist thought is the rejection of either/or thinking; thus a good ecofeminist would say that both anthropocentrism and androcentrism are the problem. Fox contends that ecofeminists can be guilty of the same transgressions of which they accuse deep ecologists if ecofeminists assert that androcentrism is the problem and mean that men are by nature or in history the only ones who have used or can use the logic of domination. I believe Fox is correct about this, as does Warren: "matriarchy is not the solution to patriarchy any more than saving nature and letting humans die is the solution to the problem of environmental destruction." 7 As demonstrated by the foregoing quotations from Warren and King, however, ecofeminists take pains to distinguish them- selves from radical feminists in denying the very strategy Fox accuses ecofeminists of being tempted to adopt. Furthermore, it is important to note that the culprit is patriarchy, not all men, and the evidence from historians and anthropologists alike indicates that male dominance is ubiquitous if not universal. Another of Fox's charges is that ecofeminists need to avoid overemphasizing the oppression of women and ignoring the domination of people of color, poor people, and aboriginal peoples. I believe Fox is again correct in asserting that this exclusion could happen as ecofeminists attempt to link feminism with ecological concerns; but again, the evidence from even the few quotations above shows that this warning has been heeded. If anything, deep ecologists are less prone than ecofeminists to take seriously the connections between the domination of nature and other forms of domination.8 The most serious challenge deep ecologists raise to ecofeminist thought is that it is "shallow." Are Naess says that a philosophy is deep when it has "ultimate premises" (the "deepest") from which a system of belief and action flow (Naess, 1986, 28). Fox contends that ecofeminists show their lack of "depth" when they criticize deep ecology for not seeing that the root cause of environmental destruction is androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism: Empirically [ecofeminism] is simplistic (and thus descriptively poor) because it fails to give due consideration to the multitude of interacting factors at work in any given situation .... Such thinking fails . . . to adopt an ecological perspective with respect to the workings of human society itself. Logically, such 100</page><page sequence="12">Robert Sessions thinking is simplistic (and thus facile) because it implies that the solution to our ecological problems is close at hand-all we have to do is remove "the real root" of the problem-when it is actually perfectly possible to conceive of a society that is non-androcentric, socioeconomically egalitarian, nonracist, and nonimperialistic with respect to other human societies, but whose members nevertheless remain aggressively anthropocentric in collectively agreeing to exploit their en- vironment for their collective benefit in ways that non- anthropocentrists would find thoroughly objectionable. (Fox 1989, 15) Fox seems to be asserting that the nature/woman connection is an historical accident that, if it had not been made by patriarchy, would leave ecofeminism indistinct from other feminist philosophies. The ecology-feminism link is accidental because it does not flow from the philosophical foundations of ecofeminism; instead, ecofeminists are concerned about ecology because his- tory has linked women to nature. Is this criticism sound? We have already seen that the ecofeminist critique of "shallow" environ- mental perspectives shares deep ecology's rejection of human centeredness and that it adds a crucial historical dimension. Thus if ecofeminism is shallow in its critique, deep ecology is as well. Furthermore, deep ecologists should be careful not to confuse abstractness with depth. For a critique to be historical and include details of the sort ecofeminism adds to the analysis of the logic of domination is not to destroy the purity of a conceptual discussion, it is to tie that discussion to the real world. The fact that particular women (or trees or aboriginal people) have suffered from an "application" of the logic of domina- tion should be understood by deep ecologists as a reminder that only in Platonic realms of ideas are logics separable from historical realities, rather than as a lack in ecofeminist thinking. Ecofeminism is, I believe, on solid ground against the deep ecologist's challenge that it is shallow, if we are speaking of ecofeminism's critique. What of the depth of various ecofeminist alternatives to naturist frameworks? And can deep ecology respond adequately to ecofeminist challenges to its "unity" solutions to the dualism deep ecology finds at the heart of anthropocentric environmental frameworks? POSITIVE IMAGES OF ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONS: UNITY OR SOLIDARITY? SOME PRELIMINARY POINTS While space does not permit a thorough examination of the positive environmental philosophies proposed by deep ecology and ecofeminism, I believe the following points help clear the way for well-focused discussions of 101</page><page sequence="13">Hypatia the crucial issues. The most serious challenge by ecofeminists to deep ecology's "unity" alternatives to anthropocentric environmental frameworks seems to be that these proposals remain trapped within the dualistic mode of thinking they reject-in seeking unity nature becomes an abstract and glorified "other" with which one becomes unified in some kind of self-transcending love. The major challenge deep ecology raises to ecofeminism's "solidarity" proposals is that they are shallow-they do not encompass the breadth of perspective necessary to transcend the anthropocentrism they should oppose. I hope to suggest how both of these criticisms mainly miss the mark, and that the real work to be done is in articulating and justifying environmentally egalitarian communities. What ecofeminists like King and Warren seem to object to in the deep ecology unity proposals is the assumption that the best way to solve our environmental problems is to rejoin the poles of a faulty duality. For not only does this strategy accept this dualism as definitive of how we relate to the world, but in seeking this unity, differences-the crucial and manifold features of the world-become obliterated. Is this accurate- does the deep ecology quest to transcend dualism and its unhappy consequences logically entail or otherwise imply destruction (or at least ignoring) of difference? Naess says that his environmental philosophy, Ecosophy T, has as its fundamental norm "Self-realization": But I do not want to give this expression any narrow, in- dividualist sense. I want to give it an expanded meaning based on the distinction between Self and self conceived in certain Eastern traditions of "atman".... [My maxim is: ] maximum (long range, universal) Self-realization. [This philosophy has three crucial implications: ] first, a somewhat extreme appreciation of diversity ... ; enthusiasm for "the mere" diversity of species or varieties within a genus of plants or animals.... Secondly, I have a somewhat extreme appreciation of what Kant calls beautiful actions in contrast to dutiful ones ... maturity in humans can be measured along a scale from selfishness to Selfishness, that is, broadening and deepening the self, rather than measures of dutiful altruism.... Thirdly, I believe that many-sided, high level Self-realization is more easily reached through a "spartan" life-style than through the material standard of average citizens of industrial states. (Naess 1986, 28-9) If we add to this Naess's statement quoted earlier that we must learn to use our "ecological imagination [to] shift reference points," I do not believe deep ecology is necessarily guilty of the charge some ecofeminists level against it. 102</page><page sequence="14">Robert Sessions For throughout the literature of deep ecology there is not only affirmation of Naess's commitment to this "extreme appreciation of diversity" but also much discussion (and practical attempts to intervene on behalf) of actual and diverse entities and systems. Thus if unity means obliteration of diversity (or disrespect for diversity), then deep ecologists are thinking and acting inconsistently. More likely, I believe, is that deep ecologists do not, as discussed in the previous section, pay enough attention to the complexity and diversity of human ecology, and furthermore they need to communicate more clearly what they mean by things like "unity" and "Self-realization." I am not saying that deep ecologists have not attempted to articulate their positive philosophies. My suggestion is more specific: they need to attend to the question of the compatibility of diversity and unity. Naess's idea of imaginative variation of perspective takes us partway toward this goal in that it indicates an understanding that unity is one among many possible standpoints we can (and should, deep ecologists argue) take. And just as ecofeminists warn us not to take only a holistic view less we forget the diversity of the world, deep ecologists believe we (in the West especially) have forgotten the whole and the links between the parts. Bear in mind too that deep ecology is urging a shift in attitude (sensibility) as well as in paradigms. Thus, while we should not ignore the values of (and differences among) individuals, we should also train our imaginations insofar as we can to observe, evaluate, and ex- perience from (as?) the whole. Finally, I believe Fox's emphasis on egalitarianism helps to clarify this issue for deep ecology. Equality does not mean identity and does not imply ignoring of differences. In fact, egalitarianism seems to be precisely what ecofeminists desire when they advocate difference but not distinction. In the previous section I argued that ecofeminism's negative critique is no shallower than that of deep ecology. What of its positive proposals? Recall that "depth" is a kind of code word for being antianthropocentric and also for thinking ecologically. When ecofeminists talk about community, solidarity, and unity in diversity, are they measuring up to this yardstick? First, I believe it is important to avoid beating people up with a yardstick, especially (if I may mix my metaphors) with a vague one. Surely the "breadth of being" deep ecologists wish to be considered in any deep ecology can be discussed in terms of community as well as in terms of unity. If anything, the science of ecology uses the language of community much more than referring to unity or whole- ness. Furthermore, many images of community can focus our attention on the interrelationships among the diverse elements of the whole better than can many images of the whole. The real complaint of those accusing ecofeminism of shallowness seems to be a caution not to forget the nonhuman world and the complex and intimate human relationships with it when discussing sexism, racism, and other forms of domination. There are many perspectives, such as radical feminist or 103</page><page sequence="15">Hypatia socialist frameworks, in which people end up slighting the domination of nature. While these examples point to a real danger, there is nothing in the logic or details of ecofeminism which would encourage such a lapse, and in fact many ecofeminists take pains to criticize socialist and radical feminism precisely for this oversight. Furthermore, ecofeminists such as Warren insist on the intimate connections between the domination of women, blacks, and others with the domination of nature. The real challenge to ecofeminism, I believe, is to articulate notions of community that include, in a comprehensible way, nonhuman nature. Spotted owls and aquifers are not our literal relatives, at least not in precisely the same ways as other humans can be. How are we to comprehend our relationships with the elements and inhabitants of the nonhuman world such that they are equal but different? This is the task to which ecofeminists and deep ecologists alike should turn, and the spatial metaphor of depth is not a particularly helpful guide in this part of the project. NOTES I would like to thank Karen J. Warren and two anonymous Hypatia readers for their help with this essay. 1. It would be very difficult to list all of the relevant sources on either deep ecology or ecofeminism-happily, a great number of people are turning their attention to environmental ethics and philosophy. I have tried to select sources of special import to these two positions for inclusion in the references at the end of this paper. For discussions of the conflict between deep ecology and ecofeminism I call your attention especially to the following: the special issue of Philosophical Inquiry 8 on ecology and philosophy; Biehl (1987); Cheney (1987,1989); Fox (1989); Kheel (1988); King (1981,1983); Naess( 1973, 1984, 1986); Salleh (1984); Tobias (1984); Warren (1987, 1990); and Zimmerman (1987). Environmental Ethics is the journal that most consistently runs articles on deep ecology and ecofeminism and their interactions. 2. Devall and Sessions (1985) look to Spinoza's philosophy as an alternative to the inherited frameworks of the domination of nature; Naess (1984, 1986) looks to Buddhism; Jonas (1983) borrows heavily from the science of ecology; LaChapelle (1978) draws on Heidegger, systems theory, and Taoism; Macy (1987) looks to Buddhism, evolutionary ecology, systems theory and transpersonal psychology; Matthews (1988) looks to Spinoza; and Walsh and Vaughan (1980) and Weber (1986) draw on systems ideas from modern science and on Eastern and Western spiritual traditions. 3. Besides Cheney, the following assert that androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism is the problem: Biehl (1987), Kheel (1988), Salleh (1984a) and Spretnak (1982). 4. Aldo Leopold is a forerunner of deep ecology, and his admonition to "think like a mountain" (Leopold 1949) has been an influential image in shaping the positive philosophies of many deep ecologists. 5. Quoted from a response by Karen Warren to a draft of this essay. 104</page><page sequence="16">Robert Sessions 6. Cheney's article includes a discussion of Hyde's (1983) analysis of gifting, Raymond's (1986) discussion of friendship, and Gilligan's (1982) analysis of the differen- ces between male and female styles of moral thinking. Warren (1990) discusses the importance of narrative and context in an attempt to show some crucial differences between feminist and masculinist ways of being moral. 7. Quoted from a response by Karen Warren to a draft of this essay. The reference in this quote to saving nature and letting humans die is to a now infamous interview with deep ecologist David Foreman wherein he advocates a callous process of human depopula- tion as a necessary step in saving the environment. Many deep ecologists as well as ecofeminists and others have criticized Foreman for his intemperate remarks. Fox (1989), for example, carefully disassociates deep ecology's philosophy from Foreman's statements. 8. King (1981, 1983) is especially strong on this point, as is Daly (1978).
