<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWENTIETH CENTURY ART Jacques Villon French, 1875-1963 The Dining Table 1912. Oil on canvas, 253/4 X 32" (65.4 x 81.3 cm). Signed and dated (upper right): Jacques Villon I912. Purchase, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Justin K. Thannhauser, by exchange. 1983.169.1 Entries by William S. Lieberman, Chairman; R. Craig Miller, Associate Curator; Lisa M. Messinger, Curatorial Assistant rom I9IO to I914, Jacques Villon was associated with such artists as Gleizes, Metzinger, Leger, and Picabia, whose styles were derived from the Analytical Cubism of Picasso and Braque. The Dining Table, one of Villon's masterpieces from this early period, shows how he assimilated Cubist ideas into his own freer, more lyrical mode to produce an individual statement. The still-life subject of the painting, infrequent in Villon's work before the First World War, was one favored by Picasso and Braque in their contemporaneous works. This particular arrangement of domestic objects-a vase of flowers, 92</page><page sequence="2">a carafe of water, a Chianti bottle, and various dishes placed on a table set for a meal-provided the imagery for a fascinating series of four drawings, three paintings, and one print that Villon did in 1912 and I913. Two of the preliminary drawings are also owned by the Museum (one a recent acquisition [I983. 69.2], the other in the Robert Lehman Collection [I975.1.753]). The Dining Table is a summation of Villon's experiments in depicting form and space. The architectural details of the interior scene are generalized, and the pictorial space is shallow and intimate. The table and the items on it are thrust diago- nally to the fore of the picture plane in a treatment very unlike the frontal perspective of Picasso's and Braque's still lifes. Villon used overlapping, transparent geometric planes of light and dark tones to denote space. The volumetric forms of the objects are defined by a network of black lines that meander over the faceted planes. The artist has animated the charac- teristically sober Cubist palette with blue, green, white, and touches of yellow. In spite of Villon's methodical revising of the scheme from previous works in the series, the result is marvelously poetic and spontaneous. WSL Willem de Kooning American, b. The Netherlands 1904 Still Life: Bowl, Pitcher, and Jug Ca. 1921. Conte crayon and charcoal on paper, 18/2 x 24 /4" (47 X 61.6 cm). Signed (lower left and on verso): DE KOONING. Van Day Truex Fund. 1983.436 mong the large number of our recent acquisitions, none is more surprising than Willem de Kooning's meticu- lously drawn Still Life: Bowl, Pitcher, andJug. Done as an aca- demic exercise when the artist was seventeen years old, the work displays de Kooning's mastery of the exacting realism and technical draughtsmanship taught in Rotterdam's Aca- demie voor Beeldende Kunsten en Technische Wetenschappen in the I920s. The sheet offers a fascinating counterpart to the later Abstract Expressionist paintings for which he is famous, primarily figurative compositions, brightly colored, spatially flattened, and enlivened by broad, gestural brushstrokes. Important because it is the artist's earliest known work, this still life is also probably the first extant creation by any of the Abstract Expressionist painters. Here, de Kooning has ren- dered with realistic if academic precision an arrangement of three worn pieces of crockery on a tabletop, paying particular attention to convincing modeling, shading, and the reflections of light on the glazed surfaces. The artist first outlined the shapes in charcoal and then used conte crayon for the interior contours to create the convincing illusion of volume. As a last step, the crayon was rubbed with a cloth to produce a uniform texture. De Kooning's technique is notable for its use of the blank paper to suggest highlights, otherwise achieved with overmarkings in light chalk.

Switzerland, 1899-1972 Relational Painting No. 64 1953. Oil on canvas, 20 x 20" (50.8 x 5o.8 cm). Gift of Celeste and Armand Bartos. 1983.579 T his painting is the first canvas by Fritz Glarner to enter the Museum's collection. It typifies the geometric ab- stractions he produced in New York after emigrating from Europe in I936. His mature work was most strongly influ- enced by the Neo-Plastic theory of Piet Mondrian, with whom he was associated in New York during the I940s. However, his commitment to nonrepresentational art had begun in Paris in 1929, when he was a member of the Abstraction-Creation group. Glarner adopted Mondrian's simplified vocabulary of forms and colors that were arranged, without representational reference, according to an architec- tonic structure. He modified the severity of Mondrian's ge- ometry by introducing diagonal lines that changed rectangles into trapezoids and created irregular rhythmical patterns. In addition to the three primary colors of Mondrian's palette, Glarner included shades of gray. These alterations in color and form added a spatial dimension to his compositions, as well as the sense of movement and vitality that characterizes his best works. Although Glarner's treatment of elements in Relational Painting No. 64 is strictly nonobjective, there is nevertheless a sense of urban architecture and dynamism. LMM David Smith American, 1906-1965 Seashell and Map 1933. Oil on canvas, 26 x 36" (66 x 91.4 cm). Signed and dated (lower right): David Smith I933. Purchase, Lila Acheson Wallace Gift. 1983.438 MWyhile in the Virgin Islands for eight months during 1931-32, David Smith made several paintings, draw- ings, and his first relief constructions, all based on Caribbean imagery. Upon returning to New York, he continued to paint island themes, working from objects that he had collected there. The images produced during this early period of his career (1930-40), in both his two-dimensional and three- dimensional works, suggest his assimilation of various con- cepts of modem European art, that is, Cubism, Construc- tivism, and Surrealism. This painting perhaps most reflects Smith's Cubist experience, filtered to him through his studies with Jan Matulka in New York. In the center is a large, flat, triangular shell shape, painted brown and outlined in yellow, that acts as a ballast for the composition's generally disjointed forms and its rhythmical linear and decorative patterning. Although created solely with oil on canvas, the overlapping arrangement of different shapes gives the impression of a collage, a medium favored by the Cubists. The irregular configurations derive from those on a map that describe the contours of land and water. The painting's subdued color scheme is also adopted from Cubism. The linear frontality and gestural qualities of Smith's mature sculpture have always been associated with the paintings of the Abstract Expres- sionists. It is revelatory, however, to see that his early paint- ings anticipated that movement by more than a decade. Furthermore, Seashell and Map is essential for a complete understanding of Smith's metal sculptures of the I95os and I960s, two of which are represented in the Museum's collection: Tanktotem II (Sounding) of 1953 (53.93) and Becca of 1965 (1972.127).

Unfortunately, her con- siderable achievements at that time were often eclipsed by those of her husband, Jackson Pollock. For the next two decades Krasner energized her paintings and collages with 94</page><page sequence="4">gestural markings and overall imagery. In the early 1970s she began working in a new direction and produced a series of extraordinarily beautiful, large paintings that utilized sim- plified, flat, "cutout" shapes similar to those of Matisse, with linear accents. These compositions-virtuosic arrangements of balance and order in which visible brushwork is kept to a minimum-differ stylistically from Krasner's earlier paintings but nevertheless refine aspects of her previous use of color and form. The lyrical curves that appear as repetitive strokes in her canvases of the I940s and I950S are distilled in pictures I such as Rising Green into a few essential shapes. Krasner's unusual palette of pink and green, which she developed in the late I950s, is enhanced in the present painting by large areas of beige. The spiky, leaflike forms that the artist creates here are suggestive of trees and other plants, although the imagery of this piece, and of other pictures from the same period, is entirely nonrepresentational. A masterwork of Krasner's mature style, Rising Green realizes her powerful lyricism on a monu- mental scale.

Purchase, Gift of George A. Hearn, by exchange. 1983.439 avid Park is an important link between the Abstract Expressionist movement of the 1940s and later figu- rative painting. From 1946 until 1952 he taught at the Califor- nia School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, where Clyfford Still, the major proponent of Abstract Expressionism in California, was the most prominent instructor. Park's deci- sive turn from abstraction to figuration in 1949 was as much a reaction against Still as it was against the formal, stylistic emphasis of the New York Abstract Expressionists. By I957 Park was a principal member of what has been alternatively referred to as "The California School" and "Bay Area Fig- urative Painting," a movement that included Richard Diebenkorn and Elmer Bischoff. Women at a Table exemplifies Park's later style, which joined representational imagery with the Abstract Expressionists' sensuous exploitation of the medium of paint. Pigment is thickly applied with broad brushstrokes, and the surface is glossy and textured. Al- though imposing in size, the painting is quiet in spirit and unassuming in subject. It is a sympathetic depiction of two people engaged in the simple, everyday activity of reading. LMM 96</page><page sequence="6">Frederick Brown American, b. 1945 The Ascension 1982. Oil on litnent, 9' x 84" (2.74 tn x 213.4 cm). Edith C. Blum Fund. 1983.259 I n The Ascensiot Frederick Brown employs with striking effect an expressionist style popular with contemporary artists. Painting with bold, glaring color and broad brush- strokes, he creates a compelling image that is of equal visual and narrative import. The large, bloodied figure of Christ, eyes closed, rises above the clouds as his disciples watch from below. This event is described in the New Testament by Luke, who recounts that "he was lifted up before their eyes, and a cloud took him from their sight" (Luke I:9). Brown's picture captures the moment just before the witnesses grasp the full significance of the Ascension: by leaving the physical world, Christ will be able to return in the form of the Holy Spirit that will inhabit all human beings. In the painting, Christ is almost completely obliterated from view (only his feet are still within the cloud), and the crowd is stunned by his departure. Most of the small figures on the hilltop look up toward him, their arms raised. Several have their heads smudged out with paint, as if they too are surrounded by a cloud. One bearded man with an agonized expression looks directly at the viewer. A trail of cloud connects the village below to the ascending Christ, a promise of his return.

The canvas is divided into three sections, and the narrative it relates is as ambiguous as it is compelling. At the right, a single trash can stuffed with refuse--empty bottles, old strips of studded wood, a shoe- stands in a street. Disembodied limbs, hairy and paw- like, jut out into the center of the composition, holding the lids of several trash cans as shields. Beneath the limbs crawl two black spiders. At the left is a jumble of skinny legs with knees bent and feet wearing oversize shoes. It is unclear in which direction the legs are running. The painting's unset- tling color combination of pink, red, and black adds to the turmoil and the despair expressed. LMM 98</page><page sequence="8">,...

Signed and dated (on verso): Chuck Connelly/I984. Edith C. Blum Fund. 1984.108 Adisturbing urban scene is created in Chuck Connelly's strange and somber necropolis. An array of buildings, both inventive and menacing in their architecture, is aligned along the diagonal axes of the picture. The varying heights of these parallel, vertical structures produce a disjointed rhythm. In the eerie silence conveyed by the setting, which is completely devoid of human presence, the only suggestion of movement is the red road that rises to pass under a gate and then continues through the city. Except for this path and one isolated accent of yellow, color is ominously absent. Even the sky is roughly overpainted to white. The scene seems drawn from a nightmare.

Blum Fund. 1983.389 he powerful subject of this painting by Cham Hendon probably derives from a photograph of a disaster repro- duced in a newspaper. A large airplane has crashed to the ground and is engulfed in a blaze of fire. Nine men, seen from behind in dark silhouette, stand helpless before the inferno. Thick swirls of smoke rise from the grotesquely bent wreckage. It is not difficult to imagine the sound and the heat of the fire, as well as the acrid smell of its fumes. The fluid look of the paint surface is a result of Hendon's unusual combination of rhoplex, a colorless synthetic me- dium requiring intense heat to harden, and acrylic, a colored synthetic paint. The viscous mixture is poured onto the canvas one color at a time, then baked under heat lamps until it sets rock hard. Even the artist's method seems appropriate to the fiery calamity that he depicts. LMM 99</page><page sequence="9">John Moore Rackstraw Downes American, b. 1941 British, b. 1939 Thursday 198o.

Two windows illuminate the neat setting and its sparse furnishings and also offer a view of the city panorama with its varied but anony- mous architecture of warehouses and offices. The time is probably a summer's morning, and work in the studio has either stopped or not begun. Traces of human presence are found in the arrangement of items on the glass-shelved table: a telephone, a container of iced tea, and empty food wrappers. The recessed windows establish the room's sym- metry, and other architectural details enhance it. Located between these openings is the exact center of the composi- tion, which is also the vanishing point for the artist's strictly disciplined perspective. The tonalities of the painting are muted and subtly varied: soft, neutral browns, whites tinged with blue and gray, suggestions of lavender, a passage of green. In spite of Moore's precise description, the scene remains mysterious. IRT Elevated Station at Broadway and I25th Street 1981-83. Oil on canvas, 25 x 47V2" (63.5 x 120.7 cm). Signed (lower right): RD. Purchase, Louis and Bessie Adler Foundation, Inc. Gift (Seymour M. Klein, President). 1984.93 T he British artist Rackstraw Downes, one of the best- known realist painters working today, has for several years depicted meticulously detailed aerial views of Manhat- tan. He delights in the task of accurately recording a great number of particulars-place, light, time of day, weather-on a relatively small canvas that may take him years to finish. IRT Elevated Station at Broadway and 125th Street measures less than four feet in width, which seems hardly large enough to contain the expansive panorama presented. Downes, how- ever, exploits this physical limitation by cramming the space full of myriad images to underscore the congestion of the urban scene depicted. Although not shown directly, the thou- sands of people living in the old tenements and newer high rises in the neighborhood of I25th Street can be imagined by the viewer. As one studies this painting, the extraordinary specificity of the artist's complex vision becomes apparent. Included are such details as the cloudy sky after a rainfall, the still-wet streets and rooftops, men at a construction site, a flock of white pigeons, and various billboards. Downes's realism is influenced by modern photography, evidenced by his awareness of peripheral vision and its attendant distortions.

Gift of Karl Bornstein. 1984.222 he eerie brightness of an unseen moon fully illuminates a summer's night to reveal a violent confrontation. Sus- pended in the sky, two dogs, each ghostly white, bare sharp teeth and claws, anticipating an encounter that can end only in bloody, mangled death. Neither beast, however, is yet victor or victim. On the ground another pair of white dogs leap gracefully across a well-kept lawn that stops just before a row of luxuriantly foliated trees. Once again the beasts are neither conqueror nor conquered; the lateral rhythm of their race contrasts with the furious meeting above. The two scenes, both washed in blue light, appear to be unrelated. But, in fact, are they? Other recent paintings by Leonard Koscianski repeat the subject of animals involved in pursuit and confirm the artist's reluctance to portray death itself. The recurrence of Koscianski's ambiguous narrative suggests that there is a more symbolic interpretation for these works. In such landscapes, might the viewer discover parallels to his own disquieting dreams? WSL IOI</page><page sequence="11">Rafael Ferrer American, b. 1933 Merengue in Boca Chica 1983. Oil on canvas, 60 x 72" (152.4 X 182.9 cm). Signed and dated (lower right): Ferrer 83. Emily andJerry Spiegel Collec- tion, Purchase, Jerry Spiegel Foundation Inc. Gift. 1984.2 In 1966 the painter and sculptor Rafael Ferrer, who was born in Puerto Rico, settled permanently in the mainland United States. The artist's Caribbean heritage and his insis- tent but sometimes conflicting memories of it remain ingre- dients essential to the spirit and the subject matter of his work. Merengue in Boca Chica is painted in an expressionist tradition and combines sophistication and deliberate naivete; the colors are exuberant and bright. On a beach, five figures face front; each seems posed as if waiting to be photo- graphed. Dressed for the sun, a blond, blue-eyed, pale- skinned woman lounges in a wooden chair. In the center of the composition, a trio of strolling musicians play a small drum, a guitar, and a guiro. Palm trees already bent by the wind appear to sway to the tropical rhythms of the combo's merengue. A fourth man, seated, stares away, unmoved by the improvised serenade. Ferrer's distortions in representation are awkward as well as revealing. Scale and proportion shift dramatically among the various elements in the painting and within the figures themselves. For instance, the heads of the musicians, oversize in relation to the slender bodies and dwarfed arms, are considerably larger than that of the man nearby. Even more puzzling are the dimensions of a diminu- tive beach chair in the right foreground. This is a ramshackle paradise, depicted with compassion and humor. WSL Rufino Tamayo Mexican, b. 1899 Children Playing 1959. Oil on canvas, 51'4 X 76-Y4" (130.2 x 194.9 cm). Signed and dated (upper right): Tamayo '59. Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Ralph E Colin. 1983.208 his picture is the first work by Rufino Tamayo, one of Mexico's best-known artists, to enter the Museum's collection. It is a large, abstract composition, painted in Paris, and reflects Tamayo's personal style, which is informed by Latin American culture and art, as well as by adaptations of Cubist modes of representation. Tamayo delights in the medium of oil paint, spreading it on the canvas with agitated strokes that create decorative patterns and textured areas rem- iniscent of frescoes. Although the work is highly colored, it uses a relatively limited palette of orange and pink with touches of blue and brown; the hues are mixed to produce multiple nuances of tone. Tamayo has adopted the Cubists' geometric analysis of form but without their sense of volume and space. His figures are segmented by divisional outlines into abstract shapes and are placed in an ambiguous, spatially flattened setting. The figure at the right, seated in profile, legs ex- tended, is the most realistically drawn. At the far left, a small child seems to stand, arm outstretched, head in three-quarter view. Between them is a radically abstracted figure who ap- pears to be facing front. The three children are literally joined in a circle within the composition by the artist's careful ar- rangement of lines and shapes that direct the viewer's eye clockwise around the elements.

Anonymous Gift. 1983.251 ernando Botero's inflated images astonish and delight. The artist is a great teller of tales, especially when in- spired by scenes remembered from his native Colombia. Nostalgia selects and enhances such memories, and what is recalled is picturesque and lively. In the present depiction of a seedy cafe, the room is overcrowded with seven musicians, two dancers, and miscellaneous items added for decorative effect: a jukebox, oranges, cigarette butts, and exposed light bulbs. The artist's selection of details is as idiosyncratic as his treatment of forms: the cellist wears a wedding band; the stringed instruments lack strings; the rotund, tubular shapes of the instruments are mimicked in the stout, thick-necked people. Curiously, there is a vast difference in demeanor between the two groups of figures. The musicians stare blankly and seem to be part of an inanimate still-life arrange- ment. They are the backdrop for the inexplicably smaller couple who dance before them with wild abandon, hair and legs flying. In recent works such as this, Botero's painting has become increasingly smooth, with few traces of brushwork; color is muted, although small areas of red, yellow, and green appear garishly bright.

Anonymous Gift. 1983.540.1 Jcta- Juan Hamilton has been active as a potter since the 1970s, J and two examples of his stoneware are in the Museum's collection. His recent transition to sculpture grew out of such early abstract work and continues his exploration of simple shapes, like the sphere and the column. Curve and Shadow es No. 2 suggests these ongoing concerns, now realized in an duce oversize format. While this sculpture is very large, measuring eight feet wide, its emphasis is on linear gesture rather than on volume. The shape is elemental and abstract: a bridgelike LMM structure that stands on two "legs" curves up gracefully to create an off-center arch. As the title indicates, the shadow thrown by the sculpture is an integral part of the piece. The dark coloration of the object is similar to that of some of Hamilton's pottery, although the mediums are quite different. Here, the artist has cast the work in bronze (this is the first of seven castings) and then coated it with black lacquer, vigorously polished to a high luster. The fluidity of the sculp- tural form is enhanced by the mirror-smooth surface that readily reflects light. Beautiful and sleekly elegant, Curve and Shadow No. 2 illustrates the artist's ability to produce memo- rable designs with a limited vocabulary of basic shapes and a monochromatic color scheme.

Dial Foundation Gift, in memory of Morse G. and Ethelwyn Dial. 1984.5.2 Perhaps the most important works to be added to our collection this year are two figure drawings by Pablo Picasso that illuminate distinct moments in the artist's early development-just before and just after his immersion in Analytical Cubism (1909-1913). The first sheet, executed during the summer of I908, is typical of Picasso's proto- Cubist style, which was informed by his knowledge of Afri- can sculpture and Cezanne's paintings. This monumental drawing of a standing peasant woman with clenched fists was the primary study for a slightly larger, more representational painting of the same subject, now in the State Hermitage Museum, Leningrad. In the Metropolitan's piece, Picasso focuses on a sculptural analysis of form, anticipating his imminent preoccupation with advanced Cubist segmenta- tion. He draws the imposing, solid figure with decisive strokes that reveal the tensions between the opposing hori- zontal and vertical lines. The impact of the image is immedi- ate and powerful; the construction of the massive figure emerges like a carving from a single block of stone or wood. Picasso had no intention of portraying a likeness here, al- though the figure seems to be based on the stout physique of Mme Putnam, at whose farm the artist rented a room in August 1908. The style of Two Players at a Table (1914) is completely different from that of Thle Peasant Woman. The later piece reveals a wonderfully whimsical and irreverent depiction of form quite unlike the serious geometric analysis of either the I908 sheet or of those works created during the intervening period of Analytical Cubism. Twvo Players at a Table clearly demonstrates a Cubist structure in the handling of planes, although the flat surfaces lack depth, shadow, and weight. The discipline and formal sobriety of Cubism are flaunted, outrageously so. Anatomy is not simplified, it is radically altered. Two seated men confront each other at a table on which a game has been placed. Their bodies are not built from bones; rather, they resemble constructions of boards to which token humanoid parts have been added. The facial features of the figures resemble those of the small dog who lies beneath the table. The player at the left turns toward his companion. His severely abstracted head, however, can be read full face as well as in profile, a device Picasso developed further in the 1920s. His opponent has two alternative torsos. The features of his full face, symmetrically arranged, are personalized by a furrowed brow and a tiny, bristly mous- tache. The subject of this drawing finds an obvious parallel in Cezanne's earlier sequence of five paintings of cardplayers, all of which Picasso studied.

Pencil and watercolor on paper, 15 /4 x 22 V2" (38.7 X 57.2 cm). Titled (upper right, in Italian): Ricerca di volumi di un edificio isolato. Purchase, Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust Gift. 1984.91 uturism was primarily concerned with images of speed and motion, which were intended to represent the spirit of the modern age. Although the greatest expression of Fu- turism is found in the medium of painting, there were some sculptural pieces executed as well, most notably by Umberto Boccioni. Architecture, a later focus for the movement, provided another three-dimensional forum for Futurist ideas about dynamism. The resulting schemes were visionary imaginings that were difficult to translate into actual struc- tures and so remained, for the most part, studies on paper. In its upwardly spiraling movement, this drawing by Virgilio Marchi typifies Futurist architectural design. It is one of several renderings made by Marchi in I9I9 and 1920 for an ideal contemporary city that was never erected. His plans indicated the preoccupation of the period with technological advances in transportation and construction. The building in the present study resembles a cone-round at the bottom, pointed at the top. There are tunneled areas and open archways below, with stairs leading to various flat levels. The two towers that rise from the center are openly constructed with stairs and columns. A spotlight is perched on a beam that extends from the peak of the left tower. The sweeping curves and the strong, linear slashes of this beautiful drawing are reminiscent of Giacomo Balla's earlier painted imagery. Marchi produced his mature work after the First World War, when the major proponents of the original Futurist movement were either dead or were experimenting in differ- ent directions. He was associated with the group of artists in Rome who were affiliated with Enrico Prampolini's review Noi. His designs followed closely the Futurist principles of architecture that had been spelled out by Antonio Sant'Elia in 1914, ideas that Marchi reiterated in 1920 in his own Manifesto of Futurist Architecture.

Watercolor, gouache, and pencil on paper, overall 22 /2 X 951/" (57.2 x 241.9 cm), six sheets, each 22/2 X 163/4" (57.2 X 42.5 cm). Signed and dated (lower right): Jennifer Bartlett I980. Kathryn E. Hurd Fund. 1983.456 arly in 1980 Jennifer Bartlett began work on At Sea, Japan, a large environmental wall piece constructed of enameled metal plates that was commissioned for the Keio University Library in Tokyo. While completing the mural in Japan, she simultaneously developed this drawing of the same title, intending its image to be translated into a wood-block- and-silkscreen print. Although used as a preliminary drawing (there are instructions to the printers written on the composi- tion), the work also exists as a finished statement. Made of six joined sheets of paper, it is dramatic in size (almost eight feet wide) and unusually narrow. The lengthy sequence depicts a narrative without being representational. It is an intimate journey into a deep, mysterious seascape, from which the viewer emerges refreshed. The abstract imagery reads from left to right and follows the random placement of twelve elliptical "swimmers" submerged in water. Reflected in the water are trees, buildings, and lights. The hues change from pastel tones of pink and blue to dark blue-blacks before returning to paler tones. Paint is applied in short, vibrant 4'- '., '- . - . . .. A. S ?, brushstrokes. In terms of color, brushwork, and cinematic "reading," Bartlett's drawing recalls Monet's panoramic water lilies, done after I899. Her early work, from the I970S, belongs to revived Conceptual and Minimalist traditions. This later watercolor is characteristic of her recent output, which, when at its best, combines gestural, coloristic paint- ing with a grid or sectional format. LMM Agnes Denes American, b. 1938 Study of Distortions: Isometric Systems in Isotropic Space 1978. Watercolor on graph paper, pen and ink on clear-plastic over- lay, 17 x 14" (43.2 X 35.6 cm). Signed and dated (lower right): Agnes Denes '78. Gift of Sarah-Ann and Werner H. Kramarsky. 1983.501.3 T his intriguing drawing is the first composition by Agnes Denes to enter the Museum's collection, and it reflects her characteristic application of science to artistic expression. Denes does not fit comfortably into any specific school, al- though her philosophical subject matter and grid motifs align her with Conceptual art and Minimalism. It is her concern with aesthetics, however, that distinguishes her work. While the viewer may not be able to understand fully the intellec- tual subjects of Denes's drawings, he can appreciate their beautiful execution and unusual analysis of form and space. Study of Distortions: Isometric Systems in Isotropic Space is typ- ical of the topographical imagery that has been the focus of the artist's creations during the last decade. In this piece she alters one's perception of space and time by projecting a section of a globe onto a cubic configuration. The work is actually made up of two sheets-underneath, a piece of graph paper on which a map is painted with watercolor, and, on top, a clear-plastic leaf on which the cube is precisely drawn with pen and ink.

Blum Fund. 1983.261 ouisa Chase is among a group of young American artists currently working in a style that is at once romantic and realistic. Her compositions utilize recognizable imagery (fig- ures, landscapes, weather conditions) in imaginative, unfa- miliar situations to suggest emotions that are often only acknowledged in the subconscious. Chase's expressionistic method of painting is the means through which she achieves her desired end. As the artist has recently written: "The physicality of the work, of the gesture is so much closer to the uncontrollability of the feeling than a symbolic depic- tion." Our untitled oil on paper illustrates this emotive qual- ity with its richly textured surface created by successive layers of paint that are thickly applied in some areas and flattened smooth in others. Intense, almost ritualistic slashing lines, evocative of arms and of tree branches, are incised into the paint. In the upper-left section of the canvas a multitude of small, linear markings encircles a decapitated torso in a manner suggestive of camouflage or flagellation. Diagonally below the figure, larger, treelike forms are amassed in a trian- gular pile, perhaps in preparation for a sacrificial offering. The connection between the two areas of the painting is unclear, and the seemingly primitive narrative depicted eludes definition. Related reference: Louisa Chase.

Hungary, 1902-1981 Armchair German (Weimar, Bauhaus), 1922. Oak with wool upholstery, 37Y4 X 221/4" (94.5 x 56.5 cm). Purchase, Theodore R. Gamble, Jr. Gift, in honor of his mother, Mrs. Theodore Robert Gamble and Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust Gift. 1983.366 This extraordinary armchair constitutes a major acquisi- tion for the Museum: our first object from the Bauhaus and our first piece of furniture by Marcel Breuer, one of the most important industrial designers of the twentieth century. The chair was conceived during Breuer's early years at Weimar and indicates the profound influence on him of those artists and architects associated with the De Stijl movement, in particular Gerrit Rietveld. The piece features a dramatic juxtaposition of minimal upholstery with a highly articulated wood frame. RCM Hugo Alvar Henrik Aalto Finnish, 1898-1976 3I Armchair Ca. 1930-33. Birch plywood, laminated wood painted black, 253/4 x 231/2" (65.4 x 59.7 cm). Purchase, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Meltzer Gift. 1984.223 Along with Marcel Breuer, the Finnish designer Alvar Aalto produced some of the most notable experiments with molded plywood during the I93os. The 31 Armchair was part of an early series developed for the Paimio Sanatorium. Aalto found that with laminated wood he could make canti- levered forms that had the strength of bent tubular steel while also providing texture and warmth. In this design he achieved a lightweight and economical chair by suspending a scrolled seating panel between two U-shaped wood frames. RCM Frank Owen Gehry American, b. Canada 1929 "Easy Edges" Side Chair Los Angeles, 1969-72. Corrugated cardboard, masonite, 333/8 x 145/16" (84.6 X 36.4 cm). Gift of Paul F. Walter. 1983.409 apier-mich6 was one of the most popular and innovative materials used for furniture in the nineteenth century, though it was most often japanned or inlaid with mother-of- pearl. Frank Gehry's chair, an extension of Alvar Aalto's work with plywood, employs laminations of corrugated cardboard. This industrial product may be stained or painted but is perhaps most appealing in its raw state. In the present object Gehry has devised an elegant but inexpensive solution to a problem that has fascinated twentieth-century designers from Gerrit Rietveld to Verner Panton: the manufacture of a chair made in one piece and from one material.

Purchase, The Berhill Fund Gift. 1984.70 he phrase "drawing into painting," which has been used to explain Jackson Pollock's mature work, exactly de- scribes this large, untitled abstraction by the American artist Cy Twombly. In his personal style, Twombly transfers the mediums and techniques of drawing, in this case colored crayon used in a calligraphic manner, to a painted canvas surface. Unlike Pollock, whose imagery was in part the result of chance as he flung paint onto the canvas, Twombly main- tains control over the creative process by applying pigment directly onto the surface in an action akin to writing. His expressive gesture is highly disciplined, though it seems to produce scribbling. Here seven horizontal registers defined with crayon cross the painted, neutral background that uni- formly covers the canvas. These parallel bands consist of loosely coiled lines drawn in shades of black and orange. Moving from top to bottom, the bands grow in size and deepen in color as their rhythm and intensity increase. Thus, the top register offers a single meandering line drawn in gray. The lowest and widest band presents an elaborate overlap- ping of multiple lines, some drawn decisively in black and orange, others rubbed into the background. The gradation of sizes and hues creates a sense of movement and suggests depth. The painting is an exceptionally fine example of Twombly's later work, in which color and line, devoid of representational allusion, provide a visual and aesthetic heir to the first-generation Abstract Expressionists.
