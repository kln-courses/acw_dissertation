The features were associated with a neighborhood populated primarily by recently-arrived Irish and German immigrants. Minimum vessel counts from the samples are employed to establish the basic consumer patterning of a number of products, ranging from ceramic tablewares to bottled foods. Also examined is the frequency and character of more "folk" associated artifacts, such as regionally made crockery and smoking pipes. The visibility of cultural identity is considered in the context of large samples of domestic debris, retrieved from rarified social settings but also dominated by mass produced and mass marketed goods. Keywords Antebellum • St. Louis • Irish • Consumption • Identity Introduction Before Chicago began its ascent during the 1850s, the city of St. Louis, Missouri, represented the principal entrepot for the Midwestern states east of the Wabash River. That city was the principal link between the merchants of this extended region to the manufacturers of the eastern seaboard, and to the wholesalers and importers of Philadelphia, New York, and New Orleans. It could be argued that a large percentage of the goods discarded during the first half of the nineteenth century in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, and Iowa spent time in a warehouse along the Mississippi River. Although the history of St. Louis, beginning as it did in the 1760s, is an unusually rich one for a Midwestern city, little professional archaeology has been conducted R.

This is particularly the case with large-scale projects that might have mitigated the effects of late twentieth century development. The interstate highway construction that cut through the heart of the city predated the historic preservation laws of the early 1970s. Predating most historical preservation acts, the construction of the Gateway Arch and the surrounding park grounds (1963-65) also received no archae ological attention, thus destroying 80 % of St. Louis's colonial footprint. More recently, however, massive construction projects such as the Cervantes Convention Center Expansion (1992), the Trans World Dome Stadium (1993), and the New Busch Stadium (2005) have skirted archaeological mitigations despite numerous relevant preservation laws. These projects have destroyed the archaeolog ical records of entire neighborhoods—including hundreds of features and tens of thousands of artifacts dating as early as the 1820s. Most of the archaeological record of antebellum St. Louis no longer exists. Only recently has professional archaeology begun to address large-scale construc tion projects downtown. Formal archaeological excavations at the site of the Eagleton United States Courthouse (1994) produced some archaeological data, but were thwarted by the mechanical removal of the majority of deep features (wells, privies, cisterns) as "hazardous waste" just days before the arrival of archaeological crews (Naglich 1999). The 2005-06 excavations at the Cochran Gardens Housing Complex examined an Irish and German neighborhood immediately north of the sites discussed below. That project, however, sampled less than 10 % of the developed area, and was also significantly limited by looting that occurred after archaeologists mechanically exposed privy features. The recent work conducted by the Missouri Department of Transportation for the 1-70 bridge crossing promises to provide new information concerning mid-to-late nineteenth century remains on the north side of the city's riverfront. Despite the significant damage caused by trespassing and looting (as in the case of the Cochran Gardens project), the excavations conducted by bottle collectors prior to and during large-scale demolition projects have been the principal form of antebellum artifact salvage in St. Louis for over 40 years. In many cases, this digging (primarily of deep features such as privies, cistern, or wells) is conducted legally with landowner or developer permission, and is often aided by construction crews themselves. Unfortunately, this type of digging generally consists of uncontrolled excavations designed only for the retrieval of intact specimens. These objects and their contexts are rarely recorded, and the fragmentary artifact assemblage of which they are part is not collected or maintained. During the mid-1990s, the Sangamo Archaeological Center (SAC) attempted to address this problem through the creation of the Urban Deep Feature Salvage Project. The goal of the project was to salvage artifact assemblages that were being unearthed and then discarded by collectors. Professional archaeologists instructed selected collectors or avocational archaeologists in basic recording and collection techniques, allowing for more controlled excavations. These efforts focused on urban, pre-Civil War sites threatened by imminent destruction by private construction projects not eligible for state or federally funded salvage. The result was the creation of one of the largest urban, antebellum data sets ever collected in the Midwest. As the principal goal of the collectors' efforts was to retrieve intact bottles or other small objects, those items were usually removed from the samples. However, intact £) Springer</page><page sequence="3">686 int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 objects generally represent less than 5 % of the vessel counts in such assemblages, and most mass produced bottles were easily recorded. In 2011, the SAC donated the 172 boxes from 61 features salvaged in St. Louis between 1993 and 2003, to the Illinois State Archaeological Survey, for permanent curation. Dating circa 1840-65, most of these assemblages have yet to be analyzed. However, a sample of ten of these features was examined and tabulated prior to the transfer, and is the subject of this report. Those features produced a minimum of 1,198 ceramic and glass vessels. Averaging 120 vessels per feature, the entire St. Louis feature collection may represent well over 7,000 vessels, all discarded by the end of the Civil War. Goals of this Study The circumstances of the salvage project resulted in an unusually large, tightly bracketed sample of artifact assemblages. As will be discussed below, these were affiliated with a rarefied social context—an antebellum neighborhood populated primarily by Irish and German immigrants. The initial goal of this study was simply to establish a set of broad consumer patterns associated with a grouping of basic durable goods from a statistically significant archaeological sample. Frequencies of ceramic and glass product types were compared between ten feature assemblages. Because those individual assemblages could be parsed into two brief, overlapping periods, patterning was also compared between these two eras. A surprising result of the study was the fundamentally homogeneous pattern of consumption of these goods, between individual feature samples and also across time. Further, there was little in the way of ethnic markers or variable patterns of con sumption that might reflect the distinctive cultural heritage of the neighborhood. This suggests that material assemblages from mid-nineteenth century urban contexts may be difficult realms in which to explore ethnic-based research questions. This article does not attempt to serve as a technical report on the collections, or as a historical study of antebellum St. Louis. Nor does it provide a review of pertinent topics concerning the archaeological study of ethnicity. Instead, it is hoped that the presentation of this data set (and the patterning contained within) may simply provide a comparative foundation from which to further explore the character of regional, mid-century artifact samples from urban contexts, and the practices and choices that these samples may or may not reflect. The study also serves as a cautionary example of the resistance of mass-produced, mass-marketed material goods to the visibility of aspects of social identity such as ethnicity. Study Area The 10 features in this study were collected between 1993 and 2002 in an area bounded by O'Fallon Street on the north, Biddle Street on the south, 6th Street on the east, and 9th Street on the west (Fig. 1). The neighborhoods immediately north of Biddle were subdivided during the early 1840s. The Study Area was part of the 4th ward in 1840, the 6th Ward in 1845, and part of the 10th Ward by 1870.

A few features contained a minority percentage of post-1860 bottle glass (discussed below), indicating they were in use until the close of the Civil War. These were probably sealed with the arrival of city sewers during the mid-1860s. In some cases, archaeological evidence indicates that privy vaults originally constructed during the late 1840s and 1850s were sealed during the early-to mid 1860s, and the upper portion of the shafts converted into cesspools for indoor plumbing. Based on the Palmatery Bird's Eye Map (1858), the Compton and Dry Bird's Eye Map (1875), and the Whipple Fire Insurance Maps (1876), the bulk of the features collected during the 1990s reflect courtyard privy vaults associated with tenements, rooming houses, and apartment buildings constructed between 1840 and 1860. These residences ranged from one to three stories tall, and single lots often contained dwellings that fronted both the street and the alley. The result (in the densest portions of the neighborhood) was the construction of small courtyards where one or two contemporaneous outhouses would have served as many as six to eight families at a Ô Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 time. Such multiple-family use, as well as the presumed high degree of turnover in apartment tenancy, suggests that there will be few instances when specific single family identities can be assigned to the samples. Instead, the artifact assemblages should be regarded as reflective of the practices and choices of a particular neigh borhood, as opposed to the reflections of individual household habits. The neighborhoods straddling Biddle Street during the mid nineteenth century are generally remembered as densely populated residential districts inhabited primary by working class Irish immigrants (e.g., Hägen 1970; Primm 1990). During the second half of the nineteenth century, locales within the district between O'Fallon and Washington Streets east of Jefferson Avenue were known by informal names such as "Kerry Patch" (referring to County Kerry in Ireland), "Castle Thunder", and "Clabber Alley" (referring to sour milk). The latter two place names referred to circa 1850s alleyways located directly south of the Study Area (Hägen 1970). The Kerry Patch designation actually "floated" across this district (Primm 1990), probably moving from east to west between 1840 and 1880. St. Patrick's Irish Catholic church (1844) was located on the east end of these neighborhoods (at 6th Street and Biddle), and St. Lawrence O'Toole Catholic church was on the western edge of the antebellum portion of the neighborhood, at 14th and O'Fallon Streets (1855). Census information from 1850 indicates that these neighborhoods were also well populated by German immigrants. A recent study of a neighborhood immediately north of this Study Area found that immigrant families comprised 86 % of the population in the two-block area bounded by 7th and 9th streets, O'Fallon Street, and Davis Street (modern Cass Street). Of that immigrant population, 58 % were enumerated as Irish immigrants, 29 % were German immigrants, and 11 % were English immigrants (Harl 2006, p. 7). This represents a much more mixed demo graphic than is implied by the nineteenth century reputation of the neighborhood. The Irish simply received more attention from those living outside of the district. It should also be noted that, while the popular conception of the neighborhood was that of a "slum," antebellum neighborhoods in St. Louis were often mixed ones socioeconomically; factory owners often lived on the same blocks as those who worked in their factories (Naglich 1999). However, the reputation of the present Study Area neighborhood as primarily a working- class one is actually supported by the 1845 city directory, which provides a look at the occupations of the residents of this neighborhood during its early years. That year reflects the beginning of the Group 1 archaeological samples discussed below. Thirty-one occupations were enumerated between 6th Street and 9th Street, north of Biddle (which may include areas north of the study area). Carpenters and laborers are the most common occupations, followed by stoneworkers and masons, blacksmiths, and other tradesmen. Three "rivermen" and a "pilot" were also living in the neighborhood, as was a "smoke pipe maker" and sexton (Table 1). There may be a few exceptional instances when an individual mentioned in the archival record is perhaps visible in the archaeological record. For instance, the 1845 city directory lists Henry Nolle, a smoking pipe maker, living on 7th Street north of Biddle Street. It was on the east side of this block that collectors excavated an idiosyncratic anthropomorphic pipe during the 1980s (prior to the establishment of the SAC salvage project). A few elbow pipes made of similar, otherwise unusual white clay have been recovered in other parts the Study Area (Fig. 2). &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="6">Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 689 Table 1 Occupations in the study area, from 1845 St. Louis City directory Blacksmith 2 Painter 1 Bookkeeper 1 Peddler 1 Bricklayer 4 Pilot 1 Butcher 2 Porter 1 Cabinet-maker 1 Quarricr 1 Carman 1 Rivcrman 3 Carter 2 Saddler 1 Carpenter 19 Sexton 1 Clerk 1 Shoemaker 4 Coal merchant 1 Smoke-pipe maker 1 Drayman 5 Stone-cutter 2 Engineer 4 Tailor 3 Laborer 12 Teamster 1 Mason 4 Tobacconist 1 Mechanic 1 Turner 1 Merchant 1 Nolle may have been of German descent, as a Henry Nolle was enumerated in the 1850 census at nearby St. Charles, Missouri as a German immigrant.

Basic notes on vault construction and fill sequences were made by the excavators, and the fecal zone was isolated and collected. In some cases, photographs were taken of the excavations in progress (Fig. 3). From these, and the accompanying notes, it is clear that some deep features were still filled with wet, partially preserved fecal material that under professional conditions could not have been excavated within OSHA standards without pumps, Tyvec suits, and respirators. Indeed, processing artifacts from these features, partic ularly intact leather shoes, was a fragrant challenge. The shafts of the mid-nineteenth century privy features in this sample were of both wood and brick construction, typically ranging from 7 to 14 ft (2 to 4 m) deep. Only three stone-lined vaults were encountered out of a total of 61. Table 2 illustrates the basic morphological breakdown of the 10 features in the sample. The Group 1 vaults (in use between ca. 1845 and 1855) were wood lined and reasonably uniform in size and shape, with surface areas ranging from 12 to 20 ft2 (3.5 to 6 m2). Their depths ranged from 5 to 10 ft (1.5 to 3 m). The profile of Feature K-6 was tapered, which is an unusual aspect in mid-century St. Louis privy vault construction. After circa 1850, privy vault construction became more variable in the neighbor hood. The Group 2 sample includes wood, brick, and stone-lined vaults, which are deeper but not necessarily larger in plan. Essentially, two or three-seat outhouses became deeper during the 1850s, and were probably constructed by an increasingly diverse range of builders. The Group 2 Feature L-3, which was in use into the 1860s, was retrofitted into a cesspool for indoor plumbing sometime during the mid-late 1860s. This involved filling over and capping the fecal zone (at approximately 8 ft m Fig. 3 Privy vault excavation photos: M3 (brick-lined), K10 (brick-lined), G14 (wood-lined), K14 (brick-lined) Ö Springer -10A Fig. 3 Privy vault excavation photos: M3 (brick-lined), K. 10 (brick-lined), G14 (wood-lined), K14 (brick-lined)</page><page sequence="8">Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 691 Table 2 Basic privy vault mor phology, Group 1 and Group 2 features Feature Lining material Shape Length-width (ft) Depth (ft.)

This resulted in a completely waterlogged, oily fecal zone below. Exact addresses of these features were not recorded by the excavators, often due to the fact that they were exposed on sites where original lot boundaries were no longer visible. However, it was noted that Feature F2 was adjacent to Fl and that both probably served the same building, with Fl apparently replacing F2 around 1850. These are the only two features in this sample that had obvious relationships to one another. Mid-century privy vaults in St. Louis are characterized by reasonably predicable and easily recognized fill sequences, regardless of their construction. The fill within the vaults can usually be divided into three basic cultural zones: a use-era fecal zone, a closing capping zone, and a series of layers comprising a slump-fill zone. Fecal zones generally range from 1 to 4 ft thick. The soils of such zones often consist of a loose, light gray-brown soil in the more shallow features. More com monly, however, deeper privy shafts (and particularly those capped with clay) contain fecal zones consisting of a very wet, greasy, soil smelling strongly of decomposed organic material. Both types of zones often contain fecally deposited seeds, as well as moderate-to-large quantities of primarily-discarded domestic debris. Due to the soft and wet nature of fecal fill, the use layers of these features are usually found to be temporally jumbled, with heavier objects having sunk deeper into the unstratified fecal material. The temporal range and diversity of materials found in otherwise homogenous fecal zones strongly suggests that artifacts were deposited during the entire use life of the privy, which generally ranged from 5 to 15 years. This does not preclude last minute abandonment-related dumping that would have been inspired by the imminent closing of the shaft. Clearly, the secondary function of deep privy shafts in urban contexts, following their use as toilets, was as repositories for household garbage. This usually included a range of primarily-deposited ceramic vessels, food and medicine bottles, and faunal remains. A number of the St. Louis assemblages also contain large samples of shoe leather. Only a small percentage of debris found in the fecal zones appears to have been secondarily-deposited, after having been discarded onto the ground surface or nearby rubbish heap. The result is a ceramic and glass vessel population in which 50 100 % of many vessels is present.

It seems likely that the clay used in capping was borrowed from the excavation of new privies nearby. Above the capping zone are often one or more thinner layers of soil and debris, used to fill the long-term slump of the clay capping fill. Artifacts from these upper layers can postdate those in the fecal zone by as much as 40 years, and represent a different form of trash deposit. While the salvage conditions at most of these sites precluded the collection of artifacts from capping and slump-fill levels, the artifacts from the bottom, use-era fecal zones were easily recognized, isolated from the less temporally sensitive zones above, and collected in a controlled manner. The bottle collectors who excavated these features generally kept only intact bottles, small items (such as smoking pipes or marbles), and in some cases, fully restorable ceramic artifacts. Considered together, such artifacts usually represent less than 10 % of most samples, by vessel count. As the majority of the items kept by diggers were mass produced bottles, they were easily documented and included in the vessel counts discussed below. The collectors usually left the ceramic population of each feature even more intact. The occasional unusual or idiosyncratic objects retained by the excavators (such as regionally-made crockery or clay smoking pipes) were photographed before they were dispersed among the collecting community. The Salvage Project curated artifacts only from the basal, use-era fecal zones of the privy features, and the data presented below was culled from only those base zones. The extraction of complete assemblages from use-era zones has provided sealed, short-term samples of primarily-deposited domestic refuse associated with one or more families living in an associated dwelling. These assemblages offer important glimpses into domestic material culture consumption and foodways practices, usually reflecting a 5-15-year period. The Samples Minimum vessel counts were created for all ceramic and glass vessels. Counting was vigorous and employed all types and sizes of sherds, not only rims or large fragments. Refined ceramic vessels were separated by ware type, decoration, and vessel type. Rim, body, and base profiles were used to determine the latter. With regards to ware type, creamware, pearlware, whiteware, ironstone and porcelain are the relevant types for the era. Unrefined ceramics were separated into three classifications: redware, stoneware, and yellowware. The identification and separation of glass vessel type is based on vessel shape, lip or base shape, and glass color. Open glass rod or iron pontil scars are recognized as predating 1860 (e.g., Farnsworth and Walthall 2011). Present in the collections are olive green wine bottles; "black" glass ale or porter bottles; whisky flasks in common aqua class; and food, soda water, and medicine/grooming/utility bottles in aqua and other-color glass. Flint glass medicine or utility bottles are also present. Tablewares (such a drinking glasses and small dishes) are of flint glass. During analysis, it became clear that two overlapping eras of deposits were repre sented in the collections: features in use during the period ca 1845-55, and features in use ca. 1850-65. For comparative purposes, 10 features representing five samples from each era, were chosen for this study. â Springe:</page><page sequence="10">Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 693 Several horizon markers were used to date the assemblages. Firstly, any significant sample devoid of ironstone was assumed to have been closed before ca. 1845. References to the product familiar to archaeologists as ironstone appear in St. Louis newspaper advertisements as early as 1839 (Mazrim and Walthall 2002). It was certainly available by the early 1840s, advertised as white granite. Thus, any signif icant sample of domestic debris postdating 1845 should contain ironstone. In this neighborhood, embossed soda water bottles are an ubiquitous artifact type — present in nearly every feature collected and often in significant numbers. Bottled soda water was introduced in St. Louis in 1845 by druggists Rudolph and John Adams (discussed below). The presence of St. Louis soda water bottles in an archaeological assemblage, like ironstone, creates an important terminus post quern for that sample. The shape and style of soda water bottles changed rapidly in St. Louis between 1845 and 1870, and coupled with the often well-documented nature of short-term soda water bottlers, this artifact type is an excellent dating device (Walthall et al. 2008). Between 1845 and 1853, for example, the most common lip finish on St. Louis soda water bottles was a sharp, tapered lip. In 1853, that lip style was entirely abandoned by the glass houses that supplied these local merchants in favor of what is known as a "shouldered blob top" (Farnsworth and Walthall 2011; Walthall et al. 2008). The ubiquity of soda water bottles in these collections allowed this techno logical marker to bracket the terminus ante quern for Group 1 features at circa 1855. Group 1 samples, then, date circa 1845-55. Group 2 features contain ironstone ceramics and blob top sodas. A general lack (at least in significant numbers) of taper top sodas suggests that most of the Group 2 privies were constructed around 1850 or slightly later. In most cases, the glass bottles in Group 2 samples (like those in Group 1) have pontil-scarred bases (either open blow pipe or iron pontil marks). However, some of the Group 2 feature also produced a minority of smooth base glass bottles, finished using a "snap case" that was introduced in Midwestern glass factories in 1860 (e.g., Farnsworth and Walthall 2011). There is little evidence in these samples of post-1865 deposits (such as soda-lime bottle glass, post-war embossed product bottles, or later ceramic makers marks). Thusly, Group 2 samples terminate at either circa 1860 (pontil bases only) or circa 1865 (a minority of smooth base bottles present). As a group, then, they are dated circa 1850-65. General Assemblage Composition Most of the artifacts found in St. Louis privy vaults represent primarily deposited kitchen refuse, comprised of food-related ceramic and glass vessels and bottles, and faunal remains. Medicine bottles also play an important role in the assemblages, and they too may have been kept and dispensed in the kitchens. Obviously non-kitchen related objects are in the minority, and include household chemical or inkbottles, as well as cosmetic, scent, and hair care product containers. Tools, hardware, furnish ings, or other forms of non-kitchen related refuse are surprisingly rare in the 61 feature sample. An important exception to this rule is shoe leather—a commonly occurring artifact type. Small items such as smoking pipes and marbles are present in £) Springer</page><page sequence="11">694 Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 small numbers, and these kinds of artifacts are probably unrepresented due to the lack of screening of feature fill. None of the 61 features in the St. Louis collection appear to have served strictly commercial buildings. In the circa 1845-55 Group 1 sample, feature assemblages were composed of nearly equal numbers of refined ceramic vessels and glass bottles, averaging 35 and 31 vessels, respectively (Table 3, Fig. 4). On average the features produced about half the number of unrefined ceramics, and during this period crockery counts are elevated by the presence of stoneware product bottles. Little kitchen crockery was broken and discarded by these households. Glass table vessels (primarily flint glass tumblers and some stemware) were usually in the small minority, except in Feature Gl, which produced over three times the number of vessels than the second-highest count. Most of these were drinking glasses. In the circa 1850-65 Group 2 sample, the number and overall percentage of glass bottles tripled, from an average of 31 vessels in Group 1 to an average of 98. This significant change was the most notable difference in the general assemblage of consumer goods between Group 1 and Group 2 samples. In general, features from this later era also tend to contain more refined vessels, averaging 50 up from 35. Complimenting ceramic wares at the table, the average number of glass serving vessels (again mostly drinking glasses) doubled, but still represents a small percent age of the overall assemblage. Against this pattern of increased consumption, unrefined ceramics actually fell slightly from the previous period. Refined Ceramics With regard to refined ceramic ware types, Group 1 samples were dominated by whiteware, which outnumbered ironstone by a margin of approximately 5:3 (see Table 3). Most of the privies in Group 1 were installed at about the same time that ironstone was becoming common in the homes of most St. Louis residents during the early-to-mid 1840s. Thus, these features contain the first decade of ironstone dis cards, along with whitewares that both predate and parallel the sale of ironstone. In the post-1850 Group 2 samples, ironstone dominated the refined assemblage by a large margin, indicating that this product overtook whiteware very shortly after 1850. In the group two samples, the average number of ironstone vessels («=30) is nearly twice as high as whiteware («=16). Informing the question of the "heirlooming" of common Queenswares is the presence of pearlware in the Group 1 features, which were established about 15 years after the discontinuation of pearlware by British potters. Notably, only three pearlware vessels (out of a total of 177 refined ceramic vessels from Group 1) are present. Clearly, the pearlware vessels that received daily use had been broken and replaced well before 1845. Those that did wind up in post-1845 samples often consist of vessels that were used or cleaned less intensively, such as large platters or saltcellars. Very often, they are deep blue, scenic, transfer printed vessels; some of the most formal and vividly decorative Queensware products before 1830. No creamware (discontinued around 1820) is present in the study samples, although a few late creamware (ca. 1820) chamber pots have been found in 1840s contexts in St. Louis. These were obviously the last forms of creamware in use in the region. £) Springer</page><page sequence="12">Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 695 Table 3 Frequency of various product types (by MNV) for Group 1 and Group 2 features Feature F2 Gl J18 K6 L4 AVG All Fl G5 K7 L3 AVG General assemblage Refined Ceramic 40 48 39 24 26 35.4 23 40 68 79 40 50 Unrefined Ceramic 30 4 18 8 14 14.8 5 12 13 26 9 13 Glass Serving Vessels 1 14 4 3 4 5.2 10 1 30 12 10 12.6 Glass Product Bottles 41 15 40 19 38 30.6 35 46 183 126 101 98.2 Refined ceramic wares Cream ware 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pearlware 1 1 0 0 1 0.6 0 0 0 2 0 0.4 Whitewarc 22 27 22 16 11 19.6 6 11 15 28 20 16 Ironstone 15 10 17 8 12 12.4 13 29 45 42 20 29.8 Porcelain 1 10 0 0 1 2.4 4 0 7 4 0 3 Tin Glazed 0 0 0 0 1 0.2 0 0 0 0 0 0 Refined vessel forms Tableware 15 16 19 10 9 13.8 11 19 30 37 16 22.6 Teaware 19 25 14 13 16 17.4 7 19 30 36 21 22.6 Toiletware 3 4 4 0 0 2.2 2 0 5 2 1 2 Other 1 1 0 1 0 0.6 1 1 3 2 2 1.8 Refined decoration White/Molded 9 21 10 3 10 10.6 17 18 43 33 17 25.6 Edged 6 I 3 2 2 2.8 1 3 2 8 3 3.4 Annular/Dipt 2 2 3 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1.6 Painted/Sponged 8 7 8 5 4 6.4 1 3 10 13 9 7.2 Printed 12 8 8 9 4 8.2 1 12 5 10 4 6.4 Flown 0 1 I 1 3 1.2 1 1 2 2 2 1.6 Gold Band 1 1 0 0 0 0.4 0 0 1 0 0 0.2 Other 1 1 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 5 1 1.4 Unrefined ceramic wares Redware 3 0 3 1 3 2 0 3 0 5 2 2 Stoneware 22 2 10 5 5 8.8 1 0 2 11 0 2.8 Ycllowwarc 5 2 5 2 5 3.8 4 9 10 11 8 8.4 Unrefined vessel forms Storage 2 1 3 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0.8 Preparation 3 0 2 1 3 1.8 1 1 0 3 1 1.2 Service 2 0 4 1 4 2.2 1 2 2 6 1 2.4 Product Container 18 0 7 4 3 6.4 0 0 0 0 0 0 Chamber Pot 1 1 1 0 1 0.8 3 3 4 4 6 4 Glass product bottles Wine 3 2 1 0 3 1.8 1 3 4 7 10 5 Ale/Porter 6 0 5 2 3 3.2 5 4 6 12 1 5.6 Whisky 4 1 2 0 3 2 0 6 4 2 5 3.4 £) Springe: Table 3 Frequency of various product types (by MNV) for Group 1 and Group 2 features Feature F2 G1 J18 K6 L4 AVG All F1 G5 K7 L3 AVG General assemblage Refined Ceramic 40 48 39 24 26 35.4 23 40 68 79 40 50 Unrefined Ceramic 30 4 18 8 14 14.8 5 12 13 26 9 13 Glass Serving Vessels 1 14 4 3 4 5.2 10 1 30 12 10 12.6 Glass Product Bottles 41 15 40 19 38 30.6 35 46 183 126 101 98.2 Refined ceramic wares Cream ware Pearlware Whitewarc Ironstone Porcelain Tin Glazed Refined vessel forms Tableware Teaware Toiletware Other Refined decoration 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0.6 0 0 0 2 0 0.4 22 27 22 16 11 19.6 6 11 15 28 20 16 15 10 17 8 12 12.4 13 29 45 42 20 29.8 1 10 0 0 1 2.4 4 0 7 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 0.2 0 0 0 0 0 0 15 16 19 10 9 13.8 11 19 30 37 16 22.6 19 25 14 13 16 17.4 7 19 30 36 21 22.6 3 4 4 0 0 2.2 2 0 5 2 1 2 1 1 0 1 0 0.6 1 1 3 2 2 1.8 White/Molded 9 21 10 3 10 10.6 17 18 43 33 17 25.6 Edged 6 I 3 2 2 2.8 1 3 2 8 3 3.4 Annular/Dipt 2 2 3 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 1.6 Painted/Sponged 8 7 8 5 4 6.4 1 3 10 13 9 7.2 Printed 12 8 8 9 4 8.2 1 12 5 10 4 6.4 Flown 0 1 I 1 3 1.2 1 1 2 2 2 1.6 Gold Band 1 1 0 0 0 0.4 0 0 1 0 0 0.2 Other 1 1 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 5 1 1.4 Unrefined ceramic wares Redware Stoneware Ycllowwarc Unrefined vessel forms Storage Preparation Service Product Container Chamber Pot Glass product bottles Wine Ale/Porter Whisky 3 0 3 1 3 2 0 3 0 5 2 2 22 2 10 5 5 8.8 1 0 2 11 0 2.8 5 2 5 2 5 3.8 4 9 10 11 8 8.4 2 1 3 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0.8 3 0 2 1 3 1.8 1 1 0 3 1 1.2 2 0 4 1 4 2.2 1 2 2 6 1 2.4 18 0 7 4 3 6.4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0.8 3 3 4 4 6 4 3 2 1 0 3 1.8 1 3 4 7 10 5 6 0 5 2 3 3.2 5 4 6 12 1 5.6 4 1 2 0 3 2 0 6 4 2 5 3.4</page><page sequence="13">696 Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 Table 3 (continued) Feature F2 Gl J18 K6 L4 AVG All Fl G5 K7 L3 AVG Soda Water 14 1 12 1 12 8 3 17 65 54 20 31.8 Foods/Condiments 0 8 3 1 5 3.4 3 0 12 7 12 6.8 Patent Medicines 1 0 0 1 1 0.6 4 2 9 1 5 4.2 Apothecary Vials 9 0 4 10 10 6.6 11 II 44 15 17 19.6 Porcelain is present in features of both eras, in nearly equal amounts. Generally consisting of French gold band or British bone china vessels, porcelain in these features is in the extreme minority, comprising about 3 % of the vessel assemblages on average. Of course, porcelain was as much as 14 times more expensive than common earthenwares (e.g., Miller 1991), and thus it was probably less common in the cupboard and used more judiciously. However, French and British porcelain was in use in this low-income neighborhood throughout the period. The tin-glazed category in these mid-century St. Louis samples consists only of French faience salve or cosmetic pots. The small, straight-sided, tin glazed vessels are of a variety that post date circa 1800, and which were in use into the 1850s (Mazrim 2011; Walthall 1991). They are generally glazed in solid blue or green, with white enamel interiors. While they are present in a number of the antebellum St. Louis collections (generally as single examples), the present study sample produced only one, from Group 1, Feature L4.

The "other" category is comprised mainly of gift plates or child's mugs, which play a negligible role in these samples. In both 10-feature assemblages, toiletwares (which consist almost entirely of chamber pots) also played a surprisingly small role in the overall sample—averaging well under 10 % of refined vessels during each era. These whiteware and ironstone chamber pots were supplemented (and often outnumbered) by yellowware products, however, which have been placed in the unrefined ceramic category (see below). Between 1845 and 1855, teawares generally outnumbered tablewares, often by a large margin (see Table 3). Cups and saucers were counted separately, as they often reflect different cup-and-saucer sets. A similar dominance of teawares has been noted in rural, pre-1840 samples in Illinois, where teawares usually outnumber tablewares by even larger margins (Mazrim 2002,2008). This pattern shifts after 1850. On average, the Group 2 samples produced equal amounts of tablewares and teawares, and only one feature produced fewer tablewares than teawares. There is no evidence in these samples of a replacement for earthenware teacups and saucers (such as mugs), and while coffee had probably superseded the consumption of tea by the 1850s (if not much earlier), hot beverages of any kind would have continued to be served in ceramic cups. The decline in teawares after 1850, then, would seem to reflect either the durability of ironstone (which should also reduce tableware counts), or perhaps the more pragmatic purchase of vessels designed for tea. In other words, the fashionable nature of teawares as a class of decorative, consumer goods (that were not necessarily tethered to their intended func tion) may have been waning during the 1840s. Figure 5 illustrates the breakdown of decorative motifs on refined ceramic vessels. It should be noted that certain decorative types were often tied primarily to certain vessel forms, and as such, the choices made regarding vessel type affected (and in some cases limited) the types of decoration that appeared at the table. For instance, edged decoration was generally applied primarily to tablewares (mostly flatware), and in Midwestern archaeological samples this is exclusively the case. Particularly after 1830, annular or "dipt" decoration was generally used on hollow tablewares (e.g., Rickard 2006). In St. Louis after 1840, that decorative motif is found primarily on table bowls and pitchers. Higher tableware counts, then, will automatically increase edged and dipt percentages, and do not reflect aesthetic decisions on the part of the consumer. Plain white tablewares and teawares become increasingly important during the 1840s and 1850s. In the Group 1 assemblages, plain white (as well as some plain or "c.c." whiteware) was the most common single form of surface treatment on refined vessels, but also generally composed less than 50 % of the refined sample. During the 1850s the number and percentage of white vessels increased considerably, reflecting a change in fashion that occurred shortly after the introduction of ironstone around 1840. Importantly, the average number of white vessels increases from 11 to 26, while the number of other-decorated vessel types stayed nearly static. The popularity of white ironstone rose dramatically over a steady baseline of still-relevant edged, painted, and printed Queenswares. Painted motifs occur primarily on whiteware, as do edged and annular designs. Although some products of the 1840s and 1850s were thick bodied, it could be argued that no edged or dipt products were manufactured in true ironstone.

The latter included "White Granite," "Paris White," as well as printed or flown table and tea sets (Mazrim and Walthall 2002). While there are some painted vessels in the St. Louis samples that must be classified as ironstone, they are in the minority. A variety of hand-painted whiteware is present in the St. Louis collections. The earliest consist of fine-line "sprig" type polychrome motifs, and concurrently manufactured broad floral patterns, executed in the same primary red, green, blue, and black colors. These remained popular and only subtly changed between circa 1835 and the early 1850s. By the mid-1850s, cut sponged and new painted motifs (including distinct green, blue, and black annular edging on flatwares) became popular, and remained so into the mid-1860s. In the small minority during both eras are dipt whiteware table bowls and pitchers, along with flown ironstone and the occasional piece of gold-banded French porcelain. Dipt motifs include plain polychrome banding, and less commonly, "mocha" (dendritic) and "cats eye" patterns. The small "other" category includes relief molded "Chelsea" ironstone, as well as copper luster and painted pink luster motifs. Legible makers' marks (printed or impressed on the bases of some refined vessels) were enumerated for this 10-feature sample (Table 4).

From approximately 650 refined vessels, only 38 easily legible marks were collected—representing approximately 5 % of the sample. Even considering the fragmentary marks (and the number of vessels represented by only small sherds), it seems unlikely that more than 30 % of the tablewares and teawares in these 1845-65 assemblages were actually marked. Such marks occur on a variety of vessels, but ironstone plates are the most common. Eighteen British companies are represented. Only two of these were represented by five or more examples: Edward Challinor and T.J. &amp; J. Mayer. Mayer products were imported directly into St. Louis by Queensware importers E.A. &amp; S.R Filley during the 1840s and 1850s (see below). If a St. Louis merchant had a direct relationship with the Edward Challinor Company, there have been no marked specimens to indicate as such. Four vessels from the ten-feature sample are marked with St. Louis importer's marks. From Group 1 samples are two marks from St. Louis importers E.A. &amp; S.R. Filley (a printed mark on a white ironstone plate, and a printed mark on a white ironstone saucer). From Group 2 samples are two different printed marks from St. Louis importer R.H.

These include St. Louis importers Giles Filley, E.A. and S.R. Filley, Chauncey Filley, N.E. Janney, and Adolphe Heinicke. Non-local importers marks found in St. Louis feature include Lewis &amp; Wilkes (Louisville) and William J. Kerr (Philadelphia). Also present in some of the samples (including Group 2 Feature K7) are ironstone plates, platters, and calling card trays with printed images of the Planter's House Hotel in St. Louis. The K7 example was made by William Ridgway, Son, and Company before 1848. These products (made for use in the hotel) were printed in several variations, each depicting the facade of the hotel in black or brown transfer prints. They probably wound up in residential St. Louis privies via hotel employees; at least one resident of the study neighborhood was listed as a porter in 1845. Unrefined Ceramics Unrefined ceramics in St. Louis during the period include redware, stoneware, and yellowware. The overwhelming majority of redware and stoneware products are of domestic, often regional origins. The semi-refined yellowware vessels may have been of Upper Ohio valley origins, or they may also be imported British yellowware. The differences between such products, if both exist in these samples, was not apparent. The ratios of unrefined wares in a given feature sample changed substantially between the two study eras (see Table 3, Fig. 6). Between 1845 and 1855, stoneware dominates the crockery samples. This is in large part a reflection of the popularity of stoneware product bottles (primarily regional root beer or porter-type beverages) during the 1840s. These bottles comprise a large percentage of the stoneware counts in Group 1 samples. Feature F2 produced a minimum of 18 such bottles. The most common marked stoneware bottles from 1840s contexts include Smith &amp; Fotheringham, and W. McCann; both St. Louis bottlers. Other stoneware vessels (present in both study groups) include medium capacity pots and jars, as well as jugs. Most vessels have salt-glazed exteriors with thin, Albany slipped interiors. Stoneware storage vessels generally represent less than 20 % of a given crockery assemblage (including yellowware). Stoneware was manufactured in nearby Commerce, Missouri, by the 1840s (Van Ravenswaay 1951). At least one marked Commerce vessel ("A.A. Austin &amp; Co.") was recovered (from Feature J26, outside of the selected study group), and similar, unmarked pots are common in the samples. Illinois stoneware also played a role in St. Louis. Group 2 Feature K7 produced a distinctive Albany-slip, dipped jar, diagnostic of the Wamack factory of Upper Alton (Walthall et al. 1991). Further, recent archival research has suggested that at least some of the popular stoneware bottles used by St. Louis bottlers were manufactured by potters in west-central Illinois (Walthall et al. 2008). Redware vessels are few during each era, and their paucity seems to reflect the lack of a local redware manufacturing tradition in St. Louis before the Civil War. The nearest probable makers of some of the redware found in these features were German potters working in nearby St. Charles and Hermann, Missouri (Van Ravenswaay 1951), but the need for redware crockery was clearly not a strong one in this Irish and German neighborhood. Between 1845 and 1855, features produced on average only two redware vessels. This number generally did not increase during the 1850s.

Storage pots and jars are present, as are chamber pots and a few kitchen bowls. However, across the entire 61-feature collection, there are a moderate number of similar, finely-potted, clear-glazed storage pots and chamber pots that may represent the work of the nearby St. Charles or Hennann potters (Fig. 7). Redware tableware service vessels (such as small pitchers) are also recovered, in contrast to rural settings where redware at the table disappears after the mid-1830s (Mazrim 2002, 2007, 2008). Group 1 Feature L4 produced at least two Germanic style redware cooking vessels — a spouted "bean pot" and a lid from a pipkin or Fig. 7 The most commonly-occurring type of rcdwarc from antebellum contexts in St. Louis, probably made by the same local pottery during the 1850s fi Springer</page><page sequence="19">702 Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 second bean pot. The frequency of these cooking vessels increases after circa 1860 in St. Louis (outside of the samples selected for this study). This may reflect an increasing German population in the growing and diversifying neighborhoods, or simply the arrival of a cottage industry designed to meet their more traditional tastes. Yellowware was nearly twice as common as redware during the 1840s, and increased sharply during the 1850s. These products were relatively new to the market, having been introduced in the region sometime in the late 1830s or early 1840s. Small amounts of yellowware are recovered from pre-1845 rural contexts in Illinois (e.g., Mazrim 2008, p. 76). The nearest maker of yellowware was the Kendall pottery in Cincinnati, which began making yellowware at least as early as 1842 (Genheimer 2011). The range of yellowware vessels in the Group 1 samples is generally eclectic. While often consisting of small table bowls and chamber pots, other vessels (includ ing an unusual teapot from Feature L4) are recovered. During the 1850s, the increase in yellowware consumption (averaging over eight vessels per feature) seems to be due to a sharp increase in the use of yellowware chamber pots. The lack of a corresponding increase in whiteware or ironstone chambers is curious. Yellowware table bowls, which remained popular through the 1850s, are often decorated in annular motifs that would have complemented British dipt Queenswares. Glass-Packaged Products Glass-packaged products represent one of the most striking trends in product con sumption between the 1840s and 1850s. The quantity and variety of bottled bever ages, foods, and medicines increased substantially in the St. Louis market during the 1850s. On average, Group 1 features produced 31 bottles. This number tripled to 98 in the Group 2 samples, which extend through the late 1850s and early 1860s (see Table 3, Fig. 8). While there is a range of product types present in the 1840s samples, they are generally limited in number. Wine bottles, "black" glass ale or porter bottles, and American figurai or cylindrical whisky flasks represent commonly occurring liquor related artifacts, which are usually infrequent in number. In the Group 1 samples, black glass bottles are the most common liquor bottle form, averaging three vessels per feature. Embossed ale bottles tend to be few. In the combined 10-feature sample, six clearly legible ale bottles are present (Table 5). All are St. Louis products. Four of these are from the various incarnations of the ale and porter business operated by the Evans Brothers between 1848 and 1859 (Walthall et al. 2008). The most common figurai whiskey flask in antebellum St. Louis is the elaborately molded "scroll" flask, a familiar bottle type in the Midwest from 1840s and 1850s contexts. Made in Pittsburgh as early as the mid-1820s, the flasks were manufactured closer to St. Louis after 1850, in Louisville-area glass houses (McKearin and Wilson 1978). Scroll flasks disappear during the Civil War, however, perhaps in part due to the introduction of the snap case, which may not have accommodated the large, oddly-shaped bottles.

The number and range of bottled foods increase steadily during the period. A ribbed, wide-mouth food bottle from Feature L4 in Group 1 is embossed on its shoulder Wm. Lewis &amp; Co., for a prominent Boston food bottler during much of the nineteenth century (Zumwalt 1980). In general, the large, more familiar "cathedral" style pickle bottles are found in 1850s contexts, while their smaller counterpart—molded sauce bottles—may have appeared slightly earlier. Soda water represents a surprisingly high percentage of glass bottles in Group 1 features, and the quantity of soda bottles rises dramatically during the 1850s. One out of four bottles from Group 1 samples is a soda water bottle, and in Group 2, soda water represents nearly one out of three. Soda water was first bottled in St. Louis in 1845, by druggists Rudolph and John Adams. A newspaper advertisement placed by the druggists in the spring of that year actually explains to local consumers that their product was "bottled by machinery in such a manner as to retain the fixed air perfectly, which renders it a beverage quite as delightful as being drawn from the fountain itself' (Peoples Daily Organ 1845). Being the earliest form of the bottled, flavored soda pop that is so ubiquitous today, these products were also marketed for their health effects during the mid nineteenth century (probably most often as relief for stomach complaints). For instance, R. &amp; J. Adams offered their product for sale to local physicians (Peoples Daily Organ 1845).

Of the 141 legible soda water bottles in the 10-feature sample, only two were made for merchants outside of St. Louis (in Cincinnati and Richmond). A third non-local product, not included in Table 5 due to illegibility (Feature L4), was bottled in New Orleans. Table 5 includes an inventory of legible soda water bottles present in the samples. Twenty-four different proprietors or partnerships are represented — the majority of the known soda water bottlers in St. Louis. In these near north side samples, the most common («=43) are those sold by Henry Grone (a son of German immigrants) after 1859. These are present in three Group 2 features. The next most common are bottles marked "Hassinger &amp; O'Brien," which date between 1860 and 1862. This is followed by bottles filled by Edward Lester (an Irish immigrant) — the only example in this study of a soda water product reasonably popular in both eras. For the most part, soda water consumption rises dramatically after 1855 in this neighborhood. Finally, medicine and utility related bottles also play an important role in the glass bottle samples from both eras. Only dip-molded apothecary bottles or embossed medical products are included in the counts in Table 3. Small, two-piece-molded bottles of various shapes probably also contained medicines, but may have contained a variety of grooming products or household chemicals as well. Their product indeterminate nature excludes them from this product-based study. While in aggregate the Group 1 sample produced more soda water bottles than medicines, on average the numbers were equal (see Table 3). Patent medicines, at least those bottled in embossed bottles, played a very minor role in the products residents of this neighborhood took home from the apothecary, however. Seven of the eight bottles in this five-feature average were dip-molded, unembossed vials.

Larger varieties are sometimes multi-paneled. Dip-molded vials were generally filled by local apothecaries with a variety of compounds, often mixed by the druggist himself. Paper labels identified common oils or medicines, while others were printed with the druggist's name, and a space for hand written contents and directions. Such vials were also used for nationally distributed patent medicines, however. Of course such labels rapidly disintegrated in the ground. For this reason, what is a ubiquitous artifact type in urban privy features is also largely mute of the specific medicinal content it once contained. Many of the features dating to the 1850s within the 61-feature sample produced a number of distinctive flint glass, dip-molded bottles. These are much heavier than their aqua glass counterparts, are usually multi-paneled. Smooth based examples of these bottles of these may also represent the earliest snap case- finished bottles found in St. Louis features, as they are in glass assemblages otherwise composed of bottles with pontil-scarred bases. It seems possible that these distinct bottles were among the flint glass products advertised by the St. Louis Glass Manufacturing Company, as early as 1846. If such were the case, they were some of the first glass bottles to be manufactured west of the Mississippi River. Embossed medicine bottles discarded in the pre-1855 Group 1 samples include Essence of Peppermint, one of the earliest embossed medicinal bottles to be distrib uted across North America (Jones 1981) and C.D Knight/Philadelphia, presumably a Pennsylvania druggist's patent medicine once identified with a paper label. The paucity of embossed or patent medicines before the mid-1850s is notable. Within the post-1850 Group 2 samples, the average number of unembossed vials nearly triples, while the number of embossed medicine products quadruples. Vials still outnumber embossed medicines by a margin of 5:1. Embossed products consist primarily of those made by (or licensed to) St. Louis druggists and merchants (see Table 5). These include the proprietary McLean's Volcanic Liniment (developed by James McLean) and Mexican Mustang Liniment (licensed to Addison Bragg, McLean's former partner) (Walthall et al. 2008). Nationally distributed products appear more frequently in samples extending into the early 1860s. These include Ayers Ague Cure, Balm of 1000 Flowers, Jayne's Carminative Balsam and Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup. Not included in the breakdown of product types in Table 3 are grooming-related products and inkbottles (see Table 5). Group 2 Feature G5 produced three embossed ink bottles and a French, flint glass toilet water bottle. Group 1 Feature Gl produced a Berry's Tricopherous hair care product. More common in early-to mid nineteenth century samples in St. Louis are the distinctive Bears Oil hair oil bottles, found in 1820s through 1860s contexts. Smoking Pipes Smoking pipes represent an artifact class that is both diverse and frequently occurring in mid- century St. Louis samples. A minimum of 28 clay smoking pipes was recovered from the 10-feature sample (Table 6). This count is based on bowl or bowl fragments only.

Eight out of 10 of the features in this study produced at least one pipe, and the average number is three. Four basic types of pipes are present; long stem, white clay pipes of European origins; glazed earthenware elbow pipes of European and American origins; stone ware elbow pipes made in the Ohio Valley region; and porcelain pipe bowls, primarily of German origins. The most common type is the long stem white clay pipe, recovered in both Group 1 and Group 2 samples. These comprise nearly half of all pipe bowls found in the combined sample. Four basic varieties of white clay pipes are commonly recovered. These consist of plain bowls or bowls decorated only with a molded leaf pattern on their vertical seams; bowls molded with vertical ribbing, pipes molded with the initials "T.D." surrounded in stars, laurel wreaths, or with no other form decoration; and pipes with more elaborate decorative molding. The latter is generally rare in the collections, although two of the study samples produced such specimens: one is decorated in a thistle motif (Al 1 in Fig. 9) and the other in with an image of an eagle (Fl). From the entire 61-feature sample, it appears that the more elaborately decorated white clay pipes generally appear after about 1860. Glazed earthenware ("redware") elbow pipes (into which a reed stem was inserted) are commonly encountered, and they represent an eclectic type. One of the most common styles is the anthropomorphic "Presidential" pipe, made in Germany during the late 1840s and 1850s. These feature images of George Washington as well as mid century presidents Taylor, Fillmore, and Pierce (Pfeiffer et al. 2006). Stoneware elbow pipes usually consist of the well-documented types from the 1840s and 1850s factories at Point Pleasant Ohio (Murphy 1967, 1985). From the study sample are six such pipes, three of which are plain, undecorated bowls. Finally, distinctive, long-profile German pipe bowls made of porcelain are occa sionally recovered. The bowls were attached to large, elaborate decorative reeds, and these pipes are very probably a valid marker of the presence of German immigrants or their immediate descendants. Many of the porcelain bowls were probably painted â Springer Table 6 Frequency of smoking pipe bowl types F2 J18 L4 All F1 G5 K7 L3 Total Long stem white clay: plain/leaf seam 1 1 2 Long stem white clay: ribbed 2 2 Long stem white clay: TD (various) 1 1 2 3 7 Long stem white clay: decorative molding 1 1 2 Earthenware elbow: plain 1 1 Earthenware elbow: ribbed 1 1 Earthenware elbow: rockingham 1 1 Earthenware elbow: presidential 1 1 2 Stoneware elbow: plain 1 1 1 3 Stoneware elbow: Pt.

One such porcelain pipe (recovered from Group 2 Feature L3) was elaborately painted (on the front of the bowl) with a soldier and civilian shaking hands against a coat of arms, and the text "Fr. Wilh. Englebrecht 1857" (see Fig. 9). On the rear of the bowl, facing the smoker, was additional text (now incomplete) that includes "FIERMANN/b. Keis. Franz/Grend. Reg 4/en/Berlin." Summary Homogeneity in the types and ratios of various consumer goods is the dominant pattern with this 10-feature, 1,200-vessel sample. The ratios of refined ceramic, crockery, table glass, and bottled products change little between features, and broader changes follow only a basic chronological trend toward more bottled products and less crockery over time. None of the 61 features collected from St. Louis produced equal or larger quantities of crockery over refined ceramics, nor did any feature produce more glass tableware than bottle glass or ceramic tableware. White ironstone was usually the dominant form of refined ceramic in most households, and its percentage increased over time, displacing printed earthenware. The use of painted teawares and edged plates remained relatively consistent throughout both periods, suggesting that the purchase of ironstone table and tea services was not necessarily tethered directly to the use of the older-style Queenswares. The new ironstone fashions seem to have been added atop of the old, and did not replace them for 20 years. If residents of this neighborhood owned refined ceramics that were more than 20 years old, they cared for them and rarely broke them. With very few exceptions, they discarded few crockery storage jars, kitchen bowls, or other food preparation vessels. The families in the neighborhood consumed predicable quantities of wine, ale, whisky and other bottled foods, and only a single feature produced a notable spike in any of these categories. That feature (F2) contained an unusually high percentage of food-related bottles, and also produced an unusually large number of regional stoneware root beer bottles. Sample F2 stands out against the other nine Vj Springer</page><page sequence="26">Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 709 features in the sample with a rare degree of relief. Bottled soda water was so ubiquitous that the only notable pattern in its consumption, at a single feature level, is its occasional paucity (as in the case of Feature All). Even medicine bottles were consumed at a predictable level, with few features straying far from the average. In an age of cholera, only one feature in this sample (K6) produced an abnormally high number of medicine bottles. While ethnicity might be hinted at in these samples (after prompting from the archival record), such visibility remains largely elusive. Basic material representa tions of regional cultural traditions include distinctive German porcelain smoking pipes and Germanic-style redware cooking vessels. These are occasionally recovered in the samples. However, deeper symmetry between these markers and the patterning of other associated goods is missing. In the ten-feature sample, features with larger quantities of redware that might be attributable to German culinary traditions are not those that produced German porcelain pipes. More significantly, little else about the patterning in the samples containing traditional items stands out against neighboring samples. The sheer popularity of bottled soda water in this Irish and German neighborhood seems notable, and should be tested against other districts or cities of the same era. In general, however, attributing ethnicity-driven choice to assemblages marked by porcelain pipes or redware pipkins seems as hazardous as attributing socioeconomic status to the occasional evidence of marked ironstone pilfered from hotels and steamboats. Even the likely poverty experienced in the district north of Biddle Street during the 1850s is difficult to see archaeologically. For instance, the neighborhood privies produced large numbers of complete soda water bottles, which could have been returned for a refill or deposit, but were discarded instead. Thus, the expected frugality of this working class neighborhood is turned on its head. Expensive French or British porcelains are also present in many of these households. Conversely, as the average uselife of these privies was about 10-15 years, an average of five broken wine bottles or three broken whisky bottles does seem rather conservative. However, how does one parse that apparent frugality with an average of 23 broken ironstone plates (most of which were less than 5 years old) over the same period? These archaeological samples may not necessarily address the questions we are accustomed to asking. Considered together, these artifact samples will provide one of the best pictures of life in mid-nineteenth century St. Louis that will be available to us archaeologically. That picture includes an abundance and variety of middling goods, and what appears to be a reasonably casual practice of their consumption and disposal. In aggregate, the archaeological picture of the material universe inside the tenements, boarding houses (and the occasional private home) suggests a neighborhood-wide subscription to table settings and basic foodstuffs that were familiar across the Midwest before the Civil War, regardless of underlying ethnic heritage. This increasingly "generic," mass-marketed catalog of ftimishings and consum ables was supplemented by a number of new local industries, such as soda water bottlers, brewers, pottery importers, and apothecary-entrepreneurs. Their marketing strategies may have created certain locally-accented aspects to this mass-produced material landscape during the 1840s and 1850s. At an individual feature level, however, there is little evidence for idiosyncratic preference. With a few exceptions £) Springer</page><page sequence="27">710 Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 (such as Feature F2), these samples basically look the same. Anomalous objects are just that—anomalies. The patterns of consumption appear rigid, and are probably modulated primarily by archaeological sample variability. The general invisibility of distinct patterns between samples may be a result of the multifamily use of privies in a crowded, high-turnover neighborhood. However, it also seems likely that the character of the objects themselves, coupled with the nature of their wholesale and retail marketing, denies clear pictures of identity on the basis of durable goods used in the kitchen. While the neighborhood was composed primarily of those bom overseas, the shelves in their kitchens were clearly stocked with ceramic and glass products that bore little resemblance to the ethnic or cultural traditions of their home countries—at least as we imagine them to be. Nearly all tables in this St. Louis neighborhood were set with the same types of white ironstones that were identical to those used in a variety of social contexts across the country. Most families used little traditional crockery in the kitchen, and most emptied new yellowware chamber pots into the outhouse. There was a pervasive choice of apothecary products over patent medicines, and ale over wine at the table. Such apparent sameness in consumer choice has been charged with impressive symbolism by a number of researchers. Wall (1994, pp. 153—154) has suggested the common purchase of gothic-pattern white granite in New York reflected the powerful influence of gothic revival churches in that city. Brighton (2006, p. 209) briefly questioned whether white granite assisted Irish families in their assimilation into Victorian American culture. Beaudry et al. (1991, pp.171—172) suggested that the ceramic assemblages of the period from tenements at Boote Mills (in Lowell, Massachusetts) reflected a "discourse" and a "set of ideals" developed as a response by the working class to changing social conditions. As Orser (1996, p. 171) has pointed out, however, the popular middle class goods in question hardly represented the targets of idealized expression or emulation. It seems just as likely that Irish (and German) immigrants in St. Louis, as well as their "non-Irish" neighbors, were simply shopping at the same middling stores for the same middling goods chosen for all customers by a handful of wholesalers and jobbers who owned the warehouses along the river. In other words, "consumer choice" was rapidly becoming a false choice, relative to decisions made by those who stocked the warehouses. Considering the reach these merchants had across the mid-continent during the 1840s and 1850s, the ramifications of this should be rather chilling to anthropologists. But of course, this is essentially an early manifestation of the problem we face today at Wal-Mart. Just how does one express one's traditional cultural identity at that store with one hundred dollars in his pocket? Certainly there is practice and choice visible in the shopping cart. But these are probably less influenced by the old ways learned from a grandfather, and more informed by a common denominator of current fashions and demands. "Kerry Patch" must have been a distinctive neighborhood in St. Louis before the Civil War. Irish and German names, stories, attitudes, practices, and songs played after dark. To be sure, the recipes followed in their kitchens were a more direct reflection of heritage, but the types of activities and choices visible in the artifact classes available to archaeologists are less attached to those traditions. Even faunal samples generally speak only of basic meat choices, and not of the nuances that make a dish "Irish," "German," or simply "St. Louis" in 1850. £) Springer</page><page sequence="28">Int J Histor Archacol (2013) 17:684-712 711 It is probably not surprisingly that there are few Irish or German artifacts in this mid nineteenth-century archaeological assemblage. Even at a folk-object level, tra ditional symbolism can be complex: the unusual pipe that might be attributable to German Henry Nolle, is decorated with a portrait of Napoleon. However, it does seem surprising that there is also little evidence (at least within the basic product categories outlined above) of Irish or German patterns of consumption. Instead, what such samples may offer is a suggestion of choices tied more to then-current fashions and emerging cosmopolitan identities, as opposed to the persistence of past traditions. Allusions to the problems of modem mass consumption are relevant here, as these artifact collections clearly contain the beginnings of many of the products and tastes with which we are familiar today. And like ours today, the consumer patterns that are discernable in these samples were associated with mass-produced, mass-marketed goods that carried with them little "built-in" identity. Some of these product types were generations-old by 1850, such as British Queenswares. Others were reasonably new ideas in marketing, such as bottled soda water or heavily advertised proprietary medicines. After the Civil War, the importance of British Queenswares faded in this country, regional crockery was industrialized, and eventually Pepsi (the descendant of the soda water sold by druggists such as Rudolph Adams) became not only a popular product, but a template for lifestyle. We may not see the remnants of post-medieval Irish or German traditions in these 1850s assemblages, but we can see the beginnings of choices that were still quite familiar to Midwestern consumers a century later. Inevitably, this will redirect our research questions away from identifying the practices of the historical "other," and toward the foundations of those practices we ourselves follow today. A certain commonality can be defined by how consumers in both nineteenth and twentieth century St. Louis appropriated post-industrial material culture. The myriad groups in each era presumably invested certain mass-produced goods with their own heritage based meanings, on a situational basis. How visible this can be to archaeologists, however, remains to be seen.
