Bertolt Brecht's ironic question, 'Can the Moses of Michelangelo take hold of us only after a professor explains him?', is answered by Claudia Echinger-Maurach, as by Brecht himself, in the affirmative. For Brecht, understanding works of art requires knowl- edge, and even more the art of observation, which the author possesses in a high degree. Her book is first of all an apologia for the finished monument that we see in S. Pietro in Vincoli - a defence of the monument as a whole in all its dignity and grandeur and an attempt to rescue it from its fate of neglect, and ultimately from the overshadowing dominance of the Moses, of the prolonged history of its genesis and of the portrayal of the monument as a personal and artistic tragedy in Michelangelo's biography. The Entstehungsgeschichte is re-explained to demonstrate how the final redaction of the monument grew out of Michelangelo's first idea. Instead of distinct phases in the tomb's development, the author sees an almost con- tinuous and fluid development in Michelan- gelo's ideas. Surviving drawings appear to validate this interpretation. The genesis of the monument is explained in terms of the intersection of successive conceptions with other determining factors: artistic, logistic, collaborative, deadlines and the incidence of the many participants. The final form of the monument began to emerge as a project for a two-storey structure in S. Pietro in Vincoli in 1532. The first level, apian terreno founda- tion, was erected in 1533-34, using marbles carved two decades earlier. Its resemblance to Michelangelo's drawing of 15 18 for the first level in London is astonishing (British Museum, 1859-5-14-824*). If the design of the first level emerges from the monument's history, the second level was designed anew. This much taller second level is a kind of piano nobile, conceived in the style of Michelangelo's 'new' architecture expound- ed in the Laurentian Library. Viewed architecturally, the Julius Mon- ument is simply a Hermengrabmal - with anthropomorphic herms as supporting ele- ments substituting the classical column orders: below, four robed men, their arms wrapped around themselves to help them support the structure's weight - the same fiction found in illustrations of the Persian Porch in sixteenth-century editions of Vitru- vius with muscular male supporting figures variously called herms, terms, atlases (e.g. Giocondo, Cesarino, Goujon, Barbaro, Riv- ius) - here embedded in an opera di intaglio context. Above, herms again, with long tapering abstract shafts, in a new architettura piana 'with, as ornament, only opera di quadro in Michelangelo's dramatic manner, a hybrid architecture, enlivened by a tension between nature and geometry. Here the canonical head-and-bust formula of the herm is nearly drained of its human element, and faces are reduced to simple grimacing unreal masks set on diminutive necks and shoulders. Michelangelo's herms are what remain of his grandiose plans for prisoners and victories - a herm was also called a prigione. Owing to the recent restoration, we can better see the monument as it is proposed in this book: an architectural membrane through which pass light, sound and rite, in an building context of wall, door, sacristy, cantoria and church. Echinger-Maurach re-identifies the centre of meaning of the monument. It is not Moses, but the papal effigy. The Imago Pietatis of Julius, in conjunction with the Madonna and Child, is already present in Michelangelo's drawing for the Julius Mon- ument of 1505 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). This deictic centre reap- pears in all the project drawings, and it forms the centre of the completed mon- ument, where its expression becomes more conventional and muted. Ultimately Julius's monument is not a paean to pagan or secular virtue but a Christian one, infused with the hope for salvation. The Moses is the only statue not made expressly for S. Pietro in Vincoli. In the course of the monument's history so many statues, finished and partially executed, were cast aside that one must wonder if Michelan- gelo himself really wished to include the Moses in the final tomb, or was he forced to do so by his patrons? On the lower level, the centre of the monument seems conceived almost as a blank, a void waiting to be filled or used, perhaps a real or fictive entrance with an inscription above. The monument is anepigraphic. The concluding chapters examine the individual statues. The effigy of Julius and the statue of the Madonna and Child finally receive their due as works conceived and partially executed by the master. A half-cen- tury ago the Rachel and Leah were viewed unfavourably in a way that is now difficult to imagine. One facet of the monument that deserves greater emphasis is the ambiguity that surrounds the identity of four of its seven statues. Condivi and Vasari identify the lateral female personifications as Rachel/ Vita contemplativa and Leah/Fïta attiva (Matilda). The Leah, at the right, clearly looks into an object which she holds in her right hand, and this object is, just as clearly, a hand-mirror with a concave upper surface, a fact verified in situ some years ago. Thus it is visually obvious that the lateral personifi- cations, among their other identities, repre- sent Hope (Rachel prays, kneeling, hands folded, eyes raised) and Prudence (Leah studies circumspectly the mirror of past, present and future). The implications of the resemblances of the two statues to Hope and Prudence are doubtless open to interpre- tation, but the resemblances themselves are inescapable and too apparent to be ignored. Although Hope and Prudence do not accord fully with the testimony of written sources, works of art, in this case unchanged in the course of nearly five hundred years, are equally valid testimonies to their own iden- tities as are narrative primary sources.</page></plain_text>
