<plain_text><page sequence="1">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS DAVID MACRITCHIE IN his interesting monograph on the Fairy-Faith, recently published,' Mr. W. Y. Evans Wentz refers to the theory that the existence of that faith is largely to be accounted for by the existence of the druids. As Mr. Wentz's treatise formed the starting-point of a paper of mine which appeared in the October (1909) number of the Celtic Review,2 wherein, for reasons of space, the 'Druid Theory' was very briefly noticed, it seems desirable to discuss that theory at some length in these pages, and to repeat in full the synopsis of it given by Mr. Wentz. It is in these words :- 'The Druid Theory to account for fairies is less widespread [than those denominated ' Naturalistic' and ' Pygmy ']. It is that the folk-memory of the Druids and their magical practices is alone responsible for the Fairy-Faith. The first suggestion of this theory seems to have been made by Patrick Graham, in his Sketches Descrip- tive of Picturesque Scenery on the Southern Confines of Perthshire, published in 1806. Alfred Maury in Les FIes du Moyen-Age, published in 1843 at Paris, appears to have made liberal use of Patrick Graham's suggestions in setting up his theory that the fees or fairy-women of the Middle Ages are due to a folk-memory of druidesses. Maury seems to have forgotten that throughout pagan Britain and Ireland, much more important in studying fairies than Celtic Europe during the Middle Ages, druids rather than druidesses 1 Rennes, Imprimnerie Oberthur, 1909. 2 Pp. 160-176. VOL. VI. R</page><page sequence="2">258 THE CELTIC REVIEW had the chief influence on the people, and yet despite this fact Irish and Welsh mythology is full of stories about fairy-women coming from the Otherworld: nor is there any proof, or even good ground for argument that the Irish fairy-women are a folk-memory of druidesses, for if there ever were druidesses in Ireland they played a subordinate and very insignificant rOle. As in the case of the Pygmy Theory we maintain that the Druid Theory also is a partial and inadequate one. It discovers a real anthropomorphic influence at work on the outward aspects of the Fairy-Faith and illogically takes that to be the origin of the Fairy-Faith.'' This last sentence, it will be seen, begs the whole question; because it assumes that those who regard the tales of the daoine-sidhe as a memory of the druids are radically in error, which is the point at issue. If the view taken by the advocates of that theory should prove to be correct, there would be no anthropomorphism in the case. In order that Mr. Wentz's position may not be misunder- stood, I have placed his synopsis before the reader ; although several of his statements appear to me to require correction. But instead of controverting these in detail I shall go on to adduce considerations which tend to support the opinions of the other side. In doing this I cannot avoid introducing at the outset the well-worn subject of the druids; with regard to which, however, there is still a great deal to be said, especially from the point of view of Gaelic chronicle and tradition. The conventional idea of a druid is aptly sustained by the dignified and venerable personages, with long beards and flowing white robes, who figure in the opera of Norma. For this conception, there is no doubt a certain amount of authority. Druids, nevertheless, are often represented to us under aspects which do not suggest either dignity or veneration. O'Curry2 speaks of them as 'little better than conjurers . . . sorcerers, and rain-doctors, who pre- tend to call down the storms and the snow, and frighten the people with the fluttering wisp and other childish charms. 1Op. cit., pp. xix-xx. 2 Manuscript Materials of Ancient History of Ireland, 1861.</page><page sequence="3">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS 259 They divined by the observation of sneezing and omens, by their dreams after holding a bull-feast, or chewing raw horseflesh in front of their idols, by the croaking of their ravens and chirping of tame wrens, or by the ceremony of licking the hot edge of bronze taken out of the rowan-tree faggot. . . . The chief or Arch-Druid of Tara is shown to us as a leaping juggler with ear-clasps of gold and a speckled cloak ; he tosses swords and balls into the air.' Dr. Whitley Stokes defines drith as denoting a wizard, buffoon, and jester.' Professor Kuno Meyer takes the last of these terms as the equivalent of druith; and the word is also thus translated by Dr. Hayes O'Grady in his Cath Mhucrama, at which battle, we are told, ' Maccon proceeded to confer with his jester, Dodera by name, whose precise origin was of the corca Luighe.' " Some of these references, particularly the description of the chief Druid of Tara, denote a caste closely resembling the jougleurs and mountebanks of the Middle Ages, and are certainly not antagonistic to the theory broached by Dr. John MacCulloch in 1824, that modern gypsies are descended from the druids ; it being understood, for the moment, that only the question of common char- acteristics is considered. Gaelic accounts agree in making the druids fortune-tellers, necromancers, and professors of occult science; and that they understood hypnotism is evident from their use of 'the druidic sleep' and 'illusion.' 1 Revue Celtique, t. xvi. : Paris 1895. ' Dil, daughter of Lugmannair, eloped from the land of the Men of Falga (the Isle of Mann) with Tulchainde, Conaire's wizard.' The Gaelic is Tulchainde drai Conaire (p. 62). Stokes adds: 'His druid (or rather chief buffoon) Tulchinne or Taulchinne is described in LU. (Leabhar na h- Uidhre) 92b-93a.' Again (p. 74): 'Tollchenn, the jester of 3nna Cennselach or of Eochaid, Enna Cennselach's son, fell in a battle against the Saxons on the Ictian Sea [the English Channel], when Niall of the Nine Hostages was mortally wounded by Eochaid's hand [A.D. 405, Four Masters]. The jester's head was cut off, and together with it the helmet.' The Gaelic is Tollchend, druth Enna Cendselaig. A druidess is thus referred to (p. 34): 'Dreco, daughter of Calmael son of Cartan, son of Connath, was a druidess and a female rhymer.' The Gaelic is bandrui agus banliccerd. Another version describes her as 'a wizard and a good poet' (drui agus degfili). She was also a poison-monger. 2 Revue Celtique, 372-397, t. xiii.: Paris, 1892. 3 Silva Gadelica, Irish Text, p. 311; Eng. trans., p. 349.</page><page sequence="4">260 THE CELTIC REVIEW The Scottish medioeval legislation directed against those who practised 'charming' and other 'abused sciences' certainly points to a survival of druidic ideas. The word 'druid' (for the capital letter may be dis- pensed with) is, however, so comprehensive that it is somewhat difficult to know when it ought to be held as solely applicable to the magic-workers of a special race. Skene furnishes us with illustrations of this complication. He cites two tracts in the Leabhar Breac in which the Magi of the New Testament are called druids; and he quotes the well-known line attributed to St. Columba, 'My Drui is Christ the Son of God.' Then, again, there is mention of Drostan the druid of the Picts, and of Broichan the magus or druid of King Brude. St. Patrick is also described as in conflict with the druids or magi of King Laogaire; and the saint prays to be protected 'Against snares of demons, Against black laws of heathenry, Against spells of women, smiths, and druids.' 'He fought against hard-hearted druids,' is said of the same saint in an ancient hymn; while other druids of the Irish Picts are referred to as 'demon-like.' 'Necromancy and idolatry, illusion, In a fair and well-walled house; Plundering in ships, bright poems, By them were taught; The honouring of sreod and omens, Choice of weather, lucky times, The watching the voice of birds They practised without disguise.' Skene further shows that the son of a druid did not always follow his father's profession, for he quotes Adamnan who 'tells of a robber who dwelt in the island of Colonsay and was in the habit of crossing to Mull and stealing the young seals which were bred for the use of the monastery of Iona, and whom he terms Erc Mocudruidi, or Erc the Druid's</page><page sequence="5">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS 261 son.' That the son of a druid should be a thief seems to point to a lack of moral teaching on the part of the father. But the stealing of young seals is, from the moral stand- point, a venial offence when compared with the picture given in the Book of Fenagh of the obscene behaviour of the druids of Leitrim and Cavan, referred to in a very suggestive connection by Dr. J. H. Todd in his Introduction to The War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill.2 Whatever be the origin-Accadian, Turanian, or what not-of that blend of science and empiricism which con- stituted the system of the druids of these islands, it is evident that trickery of one kind or another entered largely into its composition. This fact is clearly illustrated by an incident in which an Irish druid, Mailgenn, played a leading part. The wrath of Mailgenn and his brother-priests was aroused against Cormac Mac-Art, King of Ireland, because Cormac refused to worship their idols. According to some accounts, Cormac's offence was that he declined to reverence the druids themselves. The two versions are not irreconcilable, because priests of any kind are always ready to take to themselves the reverence paid to their deity. The particular deity whom Cormac objected to worship was the great wooden idol known as the Crom Cruach that, all resplendent with ornamentation of gold and silver, stood in the plain of Moy Slacht, in County Cavan, surrounded by twelve lesser deities adorned with brass. These appear to have been also made of wood; but the story suggests that the term ' druid circle,' as applied to megalithic circles, may not be so much amiss as modern scientific archaeologists are inclined to think. In any case, the Crom Cruach was a mighty god. Whether he was the same as the Crom Dubh, and what is the significance of crom in this connection, I do not know. ' The crooked maggot ' is one interpretation ; whatever that may mean. Sir Samuel Ferguson, in his Lays of the Western 1 Skene's Celtic Scotland, vol. ii. p. 115: Edinburgh, 1877; see pp. 110-121 for other references, the authorities being all carefully given. 2 London, 1867, p. cxxii, footnote 2.</page><page sequence="6">262 THE CELTIC REVIEW Gael, thus describes Cormac's contemptuous attitude to- wards the Crom :- '" Crom Cruach and his sub-gods twelve," Said Cormac, "are but carven treene; 1 The axe that made them, haft or helve, Had worthier of our worship been. '"But He who made the tree to grow, And hid in earth the iron-stone, And made the man with mind to know The axe's use, is God alone."' That the idols whom they revered, or wished people to revere, should be spoken of in such terms was too much for the druids of Cavan. So, accordingly, they met in daily convocation and, with many heartfelt curses, turned the magic pebbles-the clocha breca, or speckled stones-from left to right, in order that their evil wishes might be duly fulfilled. 'They loosed their curse against the king; They cursed him in his flesh and bones; And daily in their mystic ring They turn'd the maledictive stones, 'Till, where at meat the monarch sate, Amid the revel and the wine, He choked upon the food he ate, At Sletty, southward of the Boyne.' That is how the death of Cormac at Sletty, or Cletech, is described to us in sonorous numbers by Sir Samuel Ferguson. But, although his death was actually brought about by Mailgenn the druid, the method employed was much more direct and practical than that of invocation and priestly rites. It was simply this. A fish-bone was designedly kneaded into some bread which was placed on the royal table, for the king's use, and the bone stuck in Cormac's throat and choked him.2 i This denotes that all the thirteen idols were of wood, like the idols of the Lapps and Samoyeds; but possibly Sir Samuel Ferguson has merely assumed this to have been the case. b See ~svae Gadelica, Eng. Trans., p. 289; also the Leabhar na h-Uidhre, fol. 41b (as quoted by Petrie, Round Towers, pp. 96, 98).</page><page sequence="7">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS 263 According to the Four Masters, Cormac's death re- sulted from 'the enchantment (siabrad) which Mailgenn the druid practised upon him, after Cormac had turned against the druids, because he worshipped God rather than them." From the other account, just quoted, we have seen that the so-called 'enchantment' was merely a malicious and successful trick. But the most striking statement in the Four Masters version is that Cormac was killed by the druids 'because he worshipped God rather than them.' What had roused the murderous hate of those heathen priests was the fact that their sway was imperilled by the conversion of the king; and they felt themselves already beginning to slip from the exalted, semi-divine position which they had arrogated to themselves. In this passage, the Crom and his twelve sub-gods are passed over in silence ; the worst phase of the offence was the refusal to acknowledge the supernatural character of the druids. It will be noticed that Mailgenn is said to have accom- plished his end by means of siabrad. This is a significant word, for it denotes the form of magic employed by the siabhras, or daoine-sidhe, otherwise the Tuatha De Danann. Now, there is a passage in which this association between Mailgenn the druid and the siabhras, or Tuatha De Danann, is brought much more closely together. The passage referred to occurs in the Senchas na Relec, or History of the Ceme- teries. It does not appear in the twelfth-century Leabhar na h- Uidhre, of which the Senchas na Relec forms a part, but in 'a second copy of the same tract [i.e. the Senchas], preserved in an ancient vellum manuscript in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin, Class H. 3, 17.'2 In this manu- script the death of King Cormac is also chronicled. But it is there stated that he was killed by 'the Siabhras, i.e. the Tuatha De Danann, for they were called Siabhras.' From this statement, one is bound to infer (1) that the chroniclers 1 See Dr. Whitley Stokes at p. 512 of Folk-Lore (London, D. Nutt), December 1892. 2 See Petrie's Round Towers, p. 96,</page><page sequence="8">264 THE CELTIC REVIEW differed as to the authorship of the death of Cormac, or (2) that the chroniclers did not differ, and that, conse- quently, the Siabhras, or Tuatha De Danann, were the same people as the druids. In other words, that the druids were daoine-sidhe, or mound-people.? Here, then, if nowhere else, the supporters of what Mr. Wentz calls 'the druid theory to account for fairies' will find their opinions strongly confirmed, and in direct words. But there is also much indirect evidence of the same kind. Mention has been made, for example, of King Conaire's druid, jester, or buffoon, named Tulchinne, who eloped with Dil, the daughter of Lugmannair.' Now, we are further informed with regard to this druid Tulchinn that 'there was friendship between him and the Morrigan.' Dr. Whitley Stokes, who supplies these statements, adds the explanation: 'The Morrigan was one of the Tuatha d6 Danann.'3 Thus, in this case, a druid appears as the intimate friend of a bean-sidh, or hillock woman. The same association is seen when we consider the habitations assigned to druids and to hillock folk. The rude, bee-hive huts which, in the islands of St. Kilda and Boreray, are traditionally known as 'druids' houses,' are closely related to, and are sometimes identified with the earth-covered structures of stone which are attributed to the daoine-sidhe. To outward appearance mounds (sidhe), these latter are, in many cases, found to be stone buildings of the same primitive order of architecture as the bee-hive huts; and indeed are actually such huts heaped over with earth and stones, and covered with green turf. In the course of an instructive monograph on Beehive Houses, Duns, and Stone Circles, Mr. W. M. Mackenzie, M.A., cites two references of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to druids' houses. 'A reference to bee- I In the preceding number of the Celtic Review (October 15, 1909), there is a special reference, at p. 167, to the meaning of sid, or sidh, and its compounds. 2 See p. 259, ante, note 1. 3 Revue Celtique, t. xvi., pp. 62-63: Paris, 1895,</page><page sequence="9">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS 265 hive structures,' he observes, 'is almost certainly intended in the words of Martin (c. 1695) speaking of Skye, where none, however, is said now to exist. After describing some " earth houses," he writes: " There are several little stone houses built above ground capable only of one person, and round in form. They are called Tey-nin-druinich, i.e. Druids' House."' Mr. Mackenzie, although not himself attaching weight to traditional lore, further refers to Pennant's mention of similar structures in Glenbeg, Glenelg : ' Almost contiguous to this entrance, or portico [of one of the dcns in Glenbeg], was a small circle formed of rude stones, which was called the foundation of the Druids' houses. I was told there were many others of the kind scattered over the valley." It is necessary to discriminate when one considers the various buildings of this special order of architecture. While many were obviously built for human habitation, there are others of a more doubtful description. Those little stone houses of which Martin speaks, 'capable only of one person,' may indeed have been cells occupied by solitary druids, after the manner of Eastern hermits at the present day. But, on the other hand, they may have been built for some other purpose. They may have been sweat- baths, such as were formerly used in Ireland; or they may have been lamb-cotes.2 Although keeping these possibilities in view, one must nevertheless remember that a great number of such buildings, whether covered by earth or not, were of much larger dimensions, and were obviously used as human habitations. 1 See pp. 184-186 of vol. xxxviii. of the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland (1903-1904), in the course of Mr. Mackenzie's article. 2 Forty-three years ago, the late Captain Thomas uttered a word of warning in this respect. He had found several tiny beehive huts which seemed much too small for human habitation. They were situated beside a buaile crothaidh (gathering fold), and proved to be merely cotanan in which lambs and kids were placed while they were being speaned. ' I have thought it necessary to notice them,' observes Captain Thomas, 'as in a few years' time it might be the matter of controversy whether they were erected by the Picts or the Druids.'-Proc. Soc. Antig. Scotland, vol. vii. p. 176.</page><page sequence="10">266 THE CELTIC REVIEW It is often hastily assumed that, because of their primi- tive nature, buildings of this kind are always of great anti- quity. In a certain number of cases, such an assumption would be quite misleading. 'The continued use of the cahers, lisses, and raths is very interesting,' observes Mr. T. J. Westropp,' ' and has been treated at greater length in these pages.2 Donough Cairbreach O'Brien, some time before his death in 1242, made " a circular fort and princely palace of earth " at Clonroad-probably the last "digging of a royal rath " in Celtic history. Conor na Siudaine before 1267 made his father's rath into "a permanent stronghold with earthworks." Mortough O'Brien's men, when among the De Burgos, "successfully contest their fair share of the cahers." Mahon Macnamara came " to the very caher " where his friends were dealing for his release. On the other hand, Ruan's cahers were grass- topped in 1317, and " even every man in a caher's souter- rain" (ooan means both " caher" and " artificial cave" in northern Clare) was summoned by Prince Donough to the fight of Corcomroe [in 1317]. The following winter " every ollave rested in his rath, every coarb in his church, and every layman in his liss." ' From these references it appears that the underground structures of County Clare were in regular occupation in the year 1317. If might also be inferred, from the use of the qualifying ' even,' that the inhabitants of the souterrains were not regarded as specially good fighting men, and were only called out in extreme cases. But the statement that 'every ollave rested in his rath ' is perhaps more striking. In Irish folk-lore the raths are intimately associated with the daoine-sidhe, and this passage indicates that in 1317 they were the abodes of a learned or druidic caste. Another Irish reference, dealing with an earlier date, has similar suggestions. On the eve of the battle of Clontarf 1 In the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. xxxii., Section C, Part II., p. 158. 2 0p. cit., vol. xxxi. pp. 624-632.</page><page sequence="11">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS 267 (A.D. 1014), Prince Murchadh informs his friend Dunlang O'Hartigan that, in mounds and mound-burghs, 'i sithaib ocus i sithbrugaib,' he had been tempted with the promise of worldly advantages and eventually eternal life, ' but I never abandoned for one night my country nor my inheritance for them.' 1 Turning from these mediceval chroniclers to the modern advocates of 'the druid theory,' let us see what the latter have to say. ' The first suggestion of this theory,' observes Mr. Wentz, 'seems to have been made by Patrick Graham, in his Sketches Descriptive of Picturesque Scenery on the Southern Confines of Perthshire, published in 1806.' This statement requires to be slightly amended, for the Rev. Dr. Cririe, minister of Dalton, Dumfriesshire, had previously offered the same hypothesis in his Scottish Scenery, published in 1803.2 It is not unlikely that the two reverend doctors had discussed the matter together in the manse of Aberfoyle. Dr. Cririe remarks as follows :- 'A belief in fairies prevailed very much in the Highlands of old, indeed over all Scotland; nor has it wholly ceased at the present time. A small conical hill, called Sien, was assigned them for a dwelling; from which melodious music was frequently heard, and gleams of light seen in dark nights." . . . Most of the traditional stories respecting fairies, especially such as represented them as embodied spirits, might perhaps be accounted for upon supposition that the druids, or rather some conquered Aborigines, had fled from their enemies, and taken up their residence in those subterraneous dwellings so frequently discovered in digging in various parts of Scotland, and in some places called Picts' Houses. Covered with artificial mounts, they were generally green hills. When the country came to be inhabited around them, a regard for their own 1 The War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill, by Dr. J. H. Todd, pp. 172-173: London, 1867. Dr. Todd points out (p. clxxix, footnote) that in another account Dunlang O'Hartigan is himself designated a sioguidhe. 2 London, Caddel and Davies, pp. 347-348. 3 The Gaelic chroniclers of Ireland quite recognised the existence of mound-dwell- ings in Scotland. Thus, in The Colloquy of the Ancients, Cormac asks his men to seek if there be any tidings of Finn ' in any hillock of Ireland's or of Scotland's mound- burghs,'-i sid do shidbhrogaib Eirenn nd Alban.--Silva Gadelica, Irish text, p. 203; Eng. trans., p. 230,</page><page sequence="12">268 THE CELTIC REVIEW safety would induce them to lie hid by day, and to come abroad only in the night : it would be of consequence, if at any time their occasions should force them abroad in daylight, that their clothing should be as like the ground as possible; hence they were always dressed in green. Their narrow dwellings kept them much confined by day; hence the exercise of dancing by moonlight must have been to them most delightful, and frequently repeated in remote glens and sequestered places. Hence also their music by night in the open air; by day in their dwellings it might have betrayed them. Hence also, in dark nights, those gleams of light, which were necessary to find their way to water, or anything else they might need. Their stock of provisions might at times run short; hence their females, appearing in green gowns, borrowing oatmeal, and repaying it. Their families, in that confined state of life, from putrid or infectious diseases, might become thin, or wear away; and hence their carrying off women and children to recruit their stock : hence also the return of those carried off, being permitted to depart, after several years of absence from their own families, under a promise of keeping their secret. Difficulties may be started ; but such a supposition 1 serves to account for stories that passed current with people who, though superstitious, and apt to be imposed upon by their own imagination, were not indifferent with regard to what they thought to be truth, more than people of the present age.' This is the hypothesis set forth by Dr. Cririe in 1803. Three years later, the Rev. Dr. Graham published his Sketches of Perthshire, in the course of which work he gives expression to opinions identical with those already advanced by Dr. Cririe. Sir Walter Scott thought Graham's hypothe- sis highly deserving of mention, but he only gave it a qualified approval. In the second edition of his Sketches, published in 1812, Graham observes in a footnote :2 'Mr. Scott, in Note vii. to Canto iv. of the Lady of the Lake, expresses his dissent from this theory. . . . Without pre- suming to provoke a controversy with Mr. Scott on the subject, the author may be permitted to retain his theory until objections sufficiently valid are advanced.' 1 At this place Dr. Cririe weakly interjects the alternative clause 'or that of a diminutive lunar race.' As the mention of this alternative disturbs his main argument, it seems desirable to relegate it to a footnote. 2 Pp. 260, 261.</page><page sequence="13">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS 269 Although Dr. Graham's views coincide exactly with those of Dr. Cririe, it is important to state them here in his own words. By way of preface, the following items of local folk-lore may be quoted :' 'The men of peace 2 [hillockmen] are believed to be always dressed in green; and are supposed to take offence when any of mortal race presume to wear their favourite colour ... 'They are believed to inhabit certain round, grassy eminences, where they celebrate their nocturnal festivities by the light of the moon. About a mile beyond the source of the Forth, above Lochcon, there is a place called Coir-shi'an, or the cove of the men of peace [hillock], which is still supposed to be a favourite place of their residence. In the neighbourhood are to be seen many round, conical eminences; particularly one near the head of the lake, by the skirts of which many are still afraid to pass after sunset. It is believed that if, on Hallow Eve, any person goes alone round one of the hills nine times, towards the left hand (sinistrorsum), a door shall open, by which he will be admitted into their subterraneous abodes. 'The Reverend Robert Kirk, the first translator of the Psalms into Gaelic verse, had formerly been minister at Balquidder; and died minister of Aberfoyle in 1688, at the early age of 42 . . . He was walking, it is said, one evening in his nightgown [dressing- gown] upon the little eminence to the west of the present manse, which is still reckoned as a Dun shi'. He fell down dead, as was believed ; but this was not his fate ... ' Dr. Graham then, some pages later, proceeds towards his conclusion :- ' Before we proceed farther in this account of the still prevalent superstition of the Daoine Shi', it may be observed that it evidently appears to be founded on the history and fate of the druidical order, who formerly, in matters civil and ecclesiastical, held the supreme sway in Celtic Europe. That this hierarchy existed in Scotland can be proved satisfactorily from other sources ; but it is presumed that, to an inquiring mind, the still remaining traces of this superstition of the Daoine Shi', or men of peace [hillockmen], will furnish the best evidence of their identity with the ancient Druids, as well as the best 1 Pp. 248-250 and 253.

In whatever way, however, this opinion may be now [1806] estimated, it may be permitted to suggest that it is by no means improbable that in the slight sketch which is here offered of a mythology which is daily losing ground the principal features of the polity and doctrines of this ancient and powerful, though, in many respects, horrible hierarchy will one day be clearly recognised. 'Even in the little legends which have been given, degraded as they are by many puerile extravagancies, may we not recognize some traits of the druidical institutions which theyso studiously concealed ? May we not trace in them something of the mode by which the Druids procured the necessary supply of members for their order ? May we not trace in them the period of the noviciate of the disciples, which, when it had elapsed, fixed their condition irrevocably, as well as the general reluctance which must have been felt by young persons of either sex, to seclude themselves for ever from the gaieties of the world, and to devote themselves to retirement and a course of painful studies ? '1 After further remarks to the same effect, he goes on:- 'Accordingly, we have the best grounds from history to conclude that the Druids were enabled, by such practices, to maintain some traces of their order for many centuries after its great catastrophe.' Again, on a later page (p. 268) :- 'The deceptive power [illusion, charming, or hypnotism] by which the men of peace are believed to impose upon the senses of mankind is still termed in the Gaelic language, Druid'-eachd; i That Mr. Wentz is not entirely opposed to this interpretation may be seen at pp. 134-135 of his Fairy-Faith, where he recounts a meeting between St. Patrick, in company with the King of Ulster and his nobles, and a young man who announces, on being questioned, that he has come 'out of the sidh of the Daghda's son Bodhb Derg, out of Ireland's southern part.' He further states: 'I am Cascorach, son of Cainchinn that is ollave to the Tuatha de Danann, and am myself the makings of an ollave ' (i.e., an aspirant to the grade). With this passage may be compared the account (Fairy-Faith, p. 21, note), of a certain Welsh cromlech in connection with which 'tradition says there was once a flourishing pagan school for neophytes, and that the cromlech, instead of being a place for interments or for sacrifices was in those days completely enclosed, forming like other cromlechs a darkened chamber in which novices when initiated were placed for a certain number of days-the interior being called the " Womb or Court of Cariadwen."'</page><page sequence="15">DRUIDS AND MOUND-DWELLERS 271 founded, probably, on the opinion entertained of old concerning the magical powers of the Druids.' Finally, and with special reference to a story of a country girl who bore three children to a young fear-sidh, who was in consequence killed by the girl's brothers, Dr. Graham thus concludes: - 'In this legend there seems to be an obvious reference to a period when the men of peace [hillockmen], that is, the Druids, were considered, with the exception of the sacred mystery and solemn obligations of their order, as mere ordinary mortals. And it would even seem that, in certain cases, and under certain conditions, those who had been initiated in these mysteries might be relieved from their vows. All this is human, and belongs to the order of man. The shades of this ancient institution, it is true, have, with the lapse of many centuries, become very faint ; but in the eye of the antiquary and philosopher it may appear of some importance to exhibit the faintest tints, and to concentrate, from every quarter, the remaining lights which tend to illustrate the history of this august and once powerful order.' Two of the nineteenth-century exponents of this theory have now been quoted with sufficient amplitude. Mr. Wentz also cites Alfred Maury, who, 'in Les Fies du Moyen-Age, published in 1843 at Paris, appears to have made liberal use of Patrick Graham's suggestions in setting up his theory that the f/es or fairy-women of the Middle Ages are due to a folk-memory of druidesses.' As I have not yet seen Maury's book, I am not in a position to pass any remarks upon it. In my previous paper upon this subject,2 I observed that 'the theories known to Mr. Wentz as " Pygmy" and " Druid " are one in substance, whether they are in agree- ment with each other or not.' They are one in substance, because both seek to explain the traditional stories of mound-dwellers as the memory of a race of real people.

It will be seen that the two are not necessarily in conflict. If Scandinavia had been the region under survey, it would be evident that the two theories are simply two aspects of one theory. The 'druids' of Scandinavia were the Lapps, known generally as 'Finns' in Norway; and Nilsson, not to speak of others, interprets the Scandinavian stories of pygmies as a memory of the small-sized race of the Lapps and their mound-dwellings. The main object of this paper, however, has been to state the leading arguments in favour of the view that the druids of the British Isles were a caste of magic-workers, not very different from Lapp shamans, whose permanent homes were chambered mounds and souterrains. To what extent these arguments will appeal to the readers of this Review remains to be seen.</page></plain_text>
