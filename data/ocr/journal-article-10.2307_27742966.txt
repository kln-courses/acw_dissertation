<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAST WORDS BY DIANA FUSS Suppose "you are on your deathbed," the poet C. Day-Lewis ponders in a poem entitled "Last Words"; "with what definitive sentence will you sum / And end your being?" Betting that the premature deathbed speech is "just the game for a man of words," Day-Lewis s question stands as a provocation, both to himself and to other poets, who find themselves attracted by the idea of authoring a death, even and es pecially their own.1 But can any life be summarized and ended in a single definitive sentence? And if not, why are poets repeatedly drawn to the precise moment beyond which language is no longer possible? Pushing voice to its farthest limit, what exactly do poets hope to learn by imagining, and reimagining, the dying hour? What follows are my first thoughts on last words, inspired by more than two centuries of British and American lyrics that take as their central subject the dying words or speeches of the unhappily condemned, mortally ill, or piously prepared. Last word poems can be found in ballads and sonnets, parlor poetry and political poetry, dramatic monologues and poetic dialogues, and elegies and epitaphs. As a group they transcend the formal properties of any one poetic type, sharing instead a single thematic preoccupation: the challenge of dying a linguistically meaningful death. Last words are, at base, a specifically literary problem. Whether written or oral, the question remains the same: what words are the right words for one's final conscious moments? Poetry of course is not the only genre fascinated by the drama of the deathbed and the power of last words. Early-nineteenth-century Evangelical revivals produced a host of religious tracts, mourning manu als, published sermons, popular magazines, and fictional works, all of which idealized the power of dying words to ensure a good death and an even happier afterlife. Deathbed scenes in the nineteenth-century novel invariably incorporate what historian Pat Jalland identifies as the central distinguishing features of an Evangelical good death: a slow, painful, but fully conscious demise, borne with great fortitude and equanimity by the dying, who, in their final hour, dispense farewells and blessings to attentive family and friends.2 In a good death, the ELH 76 (2009) 877-910 ? 2009 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 877</page><page sequence="2">dying offer proof of salvation through words of contrition, confession, conversion, faith, forgiveness, wisdom, or grace. Informed by three centuries of Ars moriendi literature, Victorians in particular valued last words for the spiritual, social, and familial functions they could perform: saving one's soul, settling one's affairs, leaving one's legacy, instructing one's heirs, planning one's funeral, and consoling one's fam ily and friends.3 Yet actual deathbed scenes rarely approximated the idealized version promoted by didactic deathbed literature. Recordings of family deaths, in diaries and letters, suggest that "holy dying" was extremely difficult to achieve in practice, with most private reports of the deathbed recording "bland or banal" last words, if such words are recorded at all.4 Dying words of any kind are, in fact, hard to find in an age when newly discovered narcotics like morphine, chloroform, and ether made speech itself an unlikely event in one's dying days. More than any other literary genre, poetry played an especially central role in Protestant death chambers, at once promoting the ideal of a good death and compensating for its absence.5 At the Victorian deathbed, relatives frequently read aloud poems, hymns, or favorite scriptural passages, made readily available in collections for the sick and suffering. Popular bedside companions compiled for both the dy ing and their watchers, like Mary Tileston's Sursum Corda or Priscilla Maurice's Prayers for the Sick and Dying, include entire sections of poems "Suitable to be read to Persons in their Last Hours." These books not only arm the sick with edifying lyrics on how to die well, they also provide deathbed attendants with exact instructions on how best to read the poems aloud ("very slowly, distinctly, with intervals; not in a whisper or in a loud voice, but clearly and calmly").6 Because the Evangelical model of a good death required words of uplift, poems were often at the ready to provide meaningful last words when the dying were unable to do so themselves. Consolation poetry was not just a postmortem genre. Its powers of consolation extended to the act of dying itself, by providing final words of solace both to watchers and their dying charge, when the requirements of a good death threatened to fall distressingly beyond their grasp. For British vicar and Oxford Chair of Poetry John Keble, the source of poetry's special powers of consolation lies in its two most distinctive formal properties: rhythm and rhyme. Author of The Christian Year (1827), the nineteenth-century's most popular volume of poetry, Keble believed that only the controlling power of versification can "regulate and restrain" strong emotions like mourning.7 While today we tend to view the whole body of Victorian consolation poetry as an extravagant 878 Last Words</page><page sequence="3">over-indulgence of grief, at the time such verse was believed to achieve the very opposite, relieving minds overpowered by strong emotion. "The sigh of poesy steals without startling," explains Lydia Sigourney, nineteenth-century Americas most celebrated poet of mourning. Consolation writers on both sides of the Atlantic identified poetry as the most appropriate literary genre for the death chamber, finding versification alone subtle and harmonious enough not to interrupt either the dying or the mourner's "season of solitude."8 Of the hundreds of verses which might be readily categorized as last word poems, roughly half are traditional elegies, commemorating another's memorable or untimely passing, while the other half are self elegies, memorializing the poet's own future death. Last word poems thus look either backward or forward, capturing the dual temporality of the deathbed itself, poised on the threshold between two worlds. If poets are repeatedly drawn to the deathbed, and to the scene of love and loss enacted there, it may well be because the promise of an all-seeing "dying eye" conveys precisely the kind of privileged vantage point that poets themselves strive to attain in their writing.9 Belief in the revelation of life's mysteries on the deathbed, and faith in the unlimited insight of the dying hour, mark poetry's own claim to otherworldly or expanded vision, elevating the deathbed itself to the status of a living poem. In this essay I aim to map the richness of an unsung elegiac tradi tion of last word poems, while simultaneously examining the problem "lastness" poses for poetry. I end my consideration of the dying voice with a discussion of the significance of last words for poetry itself, a literary form fundamentally concerned not only with words that come last but with words that will always last. But first, I survey four main types of last word poems: the consoling last word, the defiant last word, the banal last word, and the new last word. These many variations on the dying voice, in both British and American poetry, suggest that poetry's last words comprise a dynamic literary convention evolving in tandem with changing cultural attitudes towards the deathbed. If in the beginning a poet's primary responsibility is to preserve words that may otherwise be lost, in the end a poet's central job is to provide words that may never have been left. In either case, last words remain, for minor and major poets alike, emblematic of the very medium of poetry, a genre preoccupied, perhaps more than any other, with the power and finitude of voice. Diana Fuss 879</page><page sequence="4">I. THE CONSOLING LAST WORD As Evangelical literature promoting exemplary Christian deaths be gins to proliferate in the nineteenth century, so too does the poetry of last words. One need look no farther than devotional poetry published by ministers to find last word poems uncritically perpetuating the fiction of a good death. Henry Ware's "Seasons of Prayer," a favorite consolation poem from The American Common-place Book of Poetry (1831), offers deathbed watchers advice on how prayer might be used to "strengthen the perilous hour": Kneel down by the dying sinner's side, And pray for his soul for him who died. Large drops of anguish are thick on his brow? O, what is earth and its pleasures now! And what shall assuage his dark despair, But the penitent cry of humble prayer? Kneel down at the couch of departing faith, And hear the last words the believer saith. He has bidden adieu to his earthly friends; There is peace in his eye that upwards bends; There is peace in his calm, confiding air; For his last thoughts are God's, his last words prayer.10 Ware, a leading Unitarian minister, explains to his flock that the watcher's responsibility differs according to the disposition of the dy ing: with the believer, the watcher receives the prayer, and learns by example how to die a good death; with the sinner, the watcher is the one who prays, lessening the sinner's despair by petitioning God on his behalf. Last words are not always the province of the dying; they can be shared or even shouldered, taken on by the voice of another in the very act of intercessory prayer so strongly recommended by the Ars moriendi.11 Last word poems spoken in the first person operate as a form of ventriloquism, with poets often assuming dying personas in order to imagine their own final moments on earth. Such literary exercises in premature dying may themselves represent attempts to spiritu ally prepare for death, in an age when the faithful were persistently encouraged to imagine their own "perilous hour." These premortem first-person consolation poems, frequently entitled "Last Words," rou tinely adopt the voice of Ware's departing believer, bidding farewell to "earthly friends" as the "eye upwards bends." Thomas Westwood, a minor British poet and Tennyson contemporary, imagines as a young 880 Last Words</page><page sequence="5">man what he might say on his deathbed to his sister, whom he envi sions weeping and "watching thro' the long night hours, / By a sick brother's bed": Weep not for me! soon, soon the weary one Will be at rest, his throbbing pulses stilled, His spirit free.?E'en now methinks I hear Sounds that are not of earth, the solemn tones Of our home s parted band, that seem to call Their child away.?Oh! Do not mourn beloved, Too long and bitterly when I am gone, And doubt not we shall meet in that bright world, Beyond the grave.12 Westwood's "Last Words" incorporates all the conventions of nine teenth-century consolation literature: a dying hour, a faithful watcher, a prepared speaker, and a promised family reunion in Heaven. The poet's projected last words?"Farewell! farewell!"?echo the simple "adieu!" of Ware's exemplary Christian death. In their sustained focus on not just the dying speaker but his attentive audience, these representative lyrics highlight the most fundamental feature of the last word poem: its irreducible sociality. Last word poems seek to shore up social and familial relations at the very moment of their irrevocable loss. The poet achieves this paradox through a subtle manipulation of audience, doubling the poem s point of address. Helen Vendler has recently identified two main forms of address in lyric poetry: the horizontal (lyrics addressed to an immediate human audience) and the vertical (lyrics addressed to a distant divine audience).13 Last word poems are horizontal and vertical at once. With their final words, the dying console the bereaved, but always with an eye toward heaven. Seeking to bridge the seen and the unseen, the poetic rehearsal of last words is conscious from the beginning of its dual audience and purpose: the human audience that must be consoled and the divine audience that must be convinced. Helen Hunt Jackson's "Last Words" (1881) is a master of the dual audience address. In this commanding speech from the deathbed, written four years before her actual death, Jackson wagers that a gra cious final farewell to family and friends may in fact be the best way to prove her soul's sanctity to God: Dear hearts, whose love has been so sweet to know, That I am looking backward as I go, Am lingering while I haste, and in this rain Of tears of joy am mingling tears of pain; Diana Fuss 881</page><page sequence="6">Do not adorn with costly shrub, or tree, Or flower, the little grave which shelters me. Let the wild wind-sown seeds grow up unharmed, And back and forth all summer, unalarmed, Let all the tiny, busy creatures creep; Let the sweet grass its last years tangles keep; And when, remembering me, you come some day And stand there, speak no praise, but only say, "How she loved us! 'Twas that which made her dear!" Those are the words that I shall joy to hear.14 Embedding the vertical address within the horizontal, Jackson looks forward and backward, demonstrating to her audiences both near and far that she is that very sentimentalist embodiment of female virtue: a woman both loving and beloved. If the central condition of dying well is to approach death gladly and willingly, with a pure heart and a clean conscience, then Jackson, by her own testimony, is on the fast track to heaven. To modern ears, Jackson's boastful modesty sounds presumptuous, self-satisfied, and not a little controlling. The sonnet s inflexible meter, tightly rhymed couplets, and heavy use of imperatives depict a woman determined to master every detail of her own memorialization, from the tending of her grave to the words spoken over it. Significantly, there are many more last word consolation poems by women than by men, a gender imbalance that can be attributed not merely to women's socially sanctioned role as ideal mourners, but to the freedom the deathbed provides to women to finally speak their minds. The death bed, historians now recognize, is one of the few areas where a woman's words have not historically been devalued.15 By artfully assuming the empowered position of a woman on her deathbed, Jackson forbids her mourners from engaging in the traditional elegiac consolations of adorning a grave or praising the dead, and instead demands from them in death something she may only have dreamt of in life: the fulfillment of her every last wish.16 Last words are, in the nineteenth century especially, a powerful platform for many of the socially and politically disenfranchised. In her poem "Last Words of an Indian Chief," Lydia Sigourney adopts a dying voice not her own in order to protest more effectively the mas sacre of Native Americans: Hear my last bidding, friends! Lay not my bones Near any white man's bones. Let not his hand Touch my clay pillow, nor his hateful voice 882 Last Words</page><page sequence="7">Sing burial hymns for me. Rather than dwell In Paradise with him, my soul would choose Eternal darkness and the undying worm.17 Professing the government's displacement of Native Americans "one of our greatest national sins," Sigourney narrates the consequences of America's immoral actions by drawing in her poem on three related traditions: the romantic literary tradition of the Noble Savage's power of oratory, the dramatic stage tradition of the Red Man's curse on the White Man, and the religious missionary tradition of the Indian Saint's dying speech.18 To express her strong opposition to the violent appropriation of the unnamed Senecan Chief's land, Sigourney ironi cally finds herself occupying his voice, his thoughts, and indeed his very interiority. Imagining the proud "pagan" chief's indignity at being memorialized by a white burial hymn, Sigourney's first-person lyric paradoxically constitutes precisely such a tribute: a burial hymn like so many others in the Christian tradition, memorializing the noble last words of the martyred dead.19 African American poet Frances Ellen Watkins Harper also turns to the device of the deathbed speech to lend political urgency to the most famous of her many last word poems, "Bury Me in a Free Land." Part of a larger group of nineteenth-century last word poems which might be labeled the "bury me/bury me not" tradition, Harper's impassioned call to "bury me in a free land" galvanizes her audience by summoning the considerable moral authority accorded to the deathbed wish.20 Make me a grave where'er you will, In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill, Make it among earths humblest graves, But not in a land where men are slaves.21 Unlike Sigourney's political last word poem, Harper's abolitionist lyric? which rhymes "will" with "hill" and "graves" with "slaves"?works not by concealing an ideological contradiction but by disclosing one. In Shira Wolosky's concise summary, "the land of the free is exposed as the home of slaves, and liberty comes to the dead, not the living."22 And yet it may be truer to say that even the dead cannot rest easy until slavery has been eradicated. In a slave nation, the poet implies, no one dies a good death. While Jackson, Sigourney, and Harper all exploit the personal and political potential of last words to command attention and to provoke response, at least one other nineteenth-century consolation poet hesitates to extol or exaggerate at all the power of last words. Unlike Diana Fuss 883</page><page sequence="8">her contemporaries, Emily Dickinson uses the deathbed address not to claim agency but to relinquish it. Her well-known "I heard a Fly buzz?when I died" (P, 591) deploys a postmortem voice to question the power of the dying speech and to undercut the sentimentalist fiction of the momentous final hour. As speaker and watchers silently await the climactic moment "when the King / Be witnessed?in the Room," they hear only the sound of an "uncertain?stumbling" fly? a grim reminder of the body's imminent decomposition and decay.23 Strikingly, none of Dickinson's many deathwatch poems include last words. These resolutely discreet poems emphasize instead the radical privacy of death: "No Notice gave She, but a Change ? / No Message, but a sigh" (P, 860). Any "changes" recorded by Dickinson's watchers are nearly imperceptible, more gestural than verbal: I've seen a Dying Eye Run round and round a Room? In search of Something?as it seemed? Then Cloudier become? And then?obscure with Fog? And then?be soldered down Without disclosing what it be 'Twere blessed to have seen? (P, 648) Dickinson's dead protect their secrets. Whatever new knowledge the dying obtain at the moment of crossing over is aggressively withheld from the living, who must look elsewhere for signs of the deceased's state of grace. The longest of Dickinsons deathwatch poems, "The last Night that She lived" (1865), concludes elliptically: We waited while She passed? It was a narrow time? Too jostled were Our Souls to speak At length the notice came. She mentioned, and forgot? Then lightly as a Reed Bent to the Water, struggled scarce? Consented, and was dead? And We?We placed the hair? And drew the Head erect? And then an awful leisure was Belief to regulate? (P, 1100) 884 Last Words</page><page sequence="9">Speaking from the side of the deathbed, Dickinson's speaker adopts the voice of the communal "We," waiting intently in the company of other watchers for any sign of the dying's spiritual readiness for death. The "notice," when it comes, remains characteristically elusive, no more than a brief mentioning and a quick forgetting. The great est evidence in the poem of imminent salvation turns out to be the single all-important word "Consented," preceded by the poet's own lyrical description of the woman's tranquil demise, depicted as the soft bending of a fragile reed toward water. Yet the poem does not end, as it might, with the actual moment of death, but continues to focus on the actions of the mourners, as they gently compose the stiffen ing body. The final cessation of activity in the room is presented, not as the "still hour" described by mourning manuals, but as an "awful leisure," afflicting the watchers no less than the corpse.24 With no more to do, and no definitive last words to temper their grief, these mourners have nothing but faith to fall back on, nothing but "Belief to regulate their despair. In a Dickinson deathwatch poem, it is the observers who are ob served most closely. If consolation is to be had, it is found not in the elusive words of the dying but in the sheer collective force of the poem's powerful communal voice. For Dickinson, it is the poet's job to provide last words, to offer lyrics which compensate readers for the gap between the ideal of holy dying and its all too painful real ity. Dickinson's deathbed poems aim to console the bereaved not for their grief but for their disappointment. Their purpose is to temper expectations of a glorious holy death, while at the same time redefining what a good death might be in the first place. Consoling the reader for the ultimate failure of consolation itself, Dickinson intimates that a good death is a modest, mundane, even mute death?the very op posite of a dramatic, scripted, loquacious death, in which salvation or damnation hangs entirely, and often vicariously, upon a fortuitously selected last word. II. THE DEFIANT LAST WORD The genre of poetry that goes farthest in debunking the fiction of a good death is not the Dickinsonian literary ballad but the more tra ditional folk ballad. Heir to the English execution broadsides, which depict the dying speeches of often penitent criminals before the gal lows, the nineteenth-century folk ballad relies no less heavily on the convention of last words, though these words are typically anything but Diana Fuss 885</page><page sequence="10">edifying. In the folk ballad, one finds a roster of characters?thieves, highwaymen, drunkards, cowboys, suicides, jilted lovers?who come to spectacular, violent, and irreligious ends. With its roots in a vernacular oral tradition, the popular ballad speaks to an audience least likely to find themselves in the Evangelical portrait of a peaceful and comfort able middle-class death. Actual deathbeds are few and far between in the ballad s tragic tales, set not in the comfortable confines of house, parlor, and bedroom, but in the remote and open spaces of cabin, corn field, and creek, to paraphrase Louise Pound's apt description. Pound, an early folklorist, collected and published one of the first anthologies of American ballads in 1922.25 Often reworking the many English, Scottish, and Irish ballads before them, American murder ballads in particular, more than any other type of folklore literature, depend principally on the narrative power of last words to create suspense, surprise, and dramatic resolution. In the American murder ballad, there are few penitent deaths, and even fewer distraught mourners. Indeed, more often than not, the mourner may turn out to be the murderer, exposed and condemned by the victim's last words. In the ballad "Johnny Randall," first recorded in a Colorado railroad camp, a mother poisons one of her sons at breakfast. In his dying breath, the son wills his brother a horse and saddle, his sister a watch and fiddle, and his mother "a twisted hemp rope, for to hang her up high."26 Upending the pious convention of last words, the fallen son bestows neither love nor forgiveness but death itself upon the murder ous mother who betrayed him. Similarly, in "The Cruel Brother," a newly wedded sister, stabbed in the breast by her possessive brother, uses her last words to bequeath "a pair of gallows to hang him on."27 These grim family romances represent the underside of the Ars moriendi: the capacity of last words not just to exhort and edify but to curse and condemn. Disdaining religious piety, the dying speech in the typical murder ballad constitutes a lethal last testament, abjuring saintly forgiveness in favor of vengeful retribution. Forgiveness is not entirely absent from the murder ballad. In the well-known nineteenth-century American folk song, "The Jealous Lover," a woman violently murdered by her rebuffed lover forgives him in her dying words: Down on her knees before him She begged him for her life; Deep, deep into her bosom, He plunged the fatal knife, "Dear Willie, I'll forgive you," Was her last dying breath; 886 Last Words</page><page sequence="11">"I never have deceived you," She closed her eyes in death.28 Rose Terry Cooke's 1888 poem "Faithful" features another dying woman refusing to name the man who viciously assaulted her. "Nobody hurt me!" They see her die, The same word still on her latest breath, With a tranquil smile she tells her lie, And glad goes down to the gates of death. Beaten, murdered, but faithful still, Loving above all wrong and woe, If she has gone to a world of ill, Where, oh! Saint, shall we others go? Even, I think, that evil man Has hope of a better life in him, When she so loved him her last words ran: "Nobody hurt me! Tve saved you, Jim!"29 The ballad tradition is replete with women afflicted with what we might call "the Desdemona complex": women who prove their love and fidelity by using their dying words not merely to forgive their abusive or jealous lovers but, more often than not, to exculpate them. And yet even here, in ballads seemingly eager to transcend the violent events they recount by embracing the practice of forgiveness that marks a good death, the faithful woman's last last words indict her killer after all. The final line of Cooke's poem, "Nobody hurt me! I've saved you, Jim," points the finger directly at the jealous lover, publicly naming him, if not to the police than to the reader, whose sympathy is entirely for the unfortunate woman, "Slain by the man she learned to love, / Beaten, murdered, and flung away."30 The last words of the Desdemona ballads provide not truth but lies?virtuous lies which of fer forgiveness and redemption with the one hand while taking them away with the other.31 Ultimately, for all their irreverence, last word ballads remain them selves ambivalently faithful to the moralizing consolation literature they seek to defy. Ballads like the immensely popular "Wicked Polly," in dramatizing the horrors of an unholy death, endorse, by negative example, the many virtues of its opposite. Too busy frolicking to attend to God, young Polly realizes when she falls mortally ill one morning that it is "too late now to repent." Pollys violent death throes are described in vivid detail: her eyes roll, her face discolors, her nails blacken, her Diana Fuss 887</page><page sequence="12">tongue bleeds, and her voice fails, though not before she tells her parents that she is "a lost ruined soul" condemned to "burn forever more." Polly's lack of spiritual preparation sentences her to eternal damnation: "When I am dead, remember well / Your wicked Polly groans in hell!"32 No less sermonizing than the conventional consola tion poem, this moralizing tale, part of a long tradition of monitory literature, offers its own cautionary lesson on how not to die well. Indeed, the poem would parody perfectly the Evangelical deathbed scene, were its tone not so earnest and its language so clich?d. Such poems, in seeking to bring forcefully into view a truly bad death, in the end simply strengthen belief in a good one. A more successful challenge to the rigid pieties of deathbed dogma comes in the literary satire, for almost as soon as last word collections appear on the scene, a subgenre of mock last words emerges to check them. In the many eighteenth-century anthologies recounting "last days," "last hours," and "last farewells," readers found confirmation of the final estate of sinners and saints alike.33 Abandoning simple refusal in favor of canny parody, the satirical ballad responds to the vogue in last word anthologies by stripping last words of their weighty preten sions and placing them in the mouths of animals. In Robert Burns's "The Death and Dying Words of Poor Mailie, The Authors Only Pet Yowe: an Unco Mournfu' Tale," the poet's ewe delivers a lengthy dying speech from a ditch where she has fallen entangled by a tether. Advis ing her master against the use of a leash next time, the ewe charges Burns with the care of her two lambs, before blessing her "bairns" with her dying last breath.34 James Robertson chooses a less innocent lamb for the satirizing of last words in his 1773 poem "The last Speech and Dying Words of Willy, a Pet-Lamb, who was executed by the Hands of a common Butcher, for gnawing, tearing, and murdering one of Miss -lac'd Ruffles." Parodying the execution broadside, this satirical ballad's "little lambkin" foreswears ruffles, begs forgiveness, and pleads for mercy from his mistress. Finally realizing that he must "atone" for his sins with his life, Willy's loyal "last request" is to be not butchered but turned into lamb-skin gloves to warm his mistress's hands.35 As the specific and symbolically weighted choice of a dying lamb might suggest, these comic satires go farther than the more somber murder ballads in challenging the foundational Christian allegory un derpinning the convention of last words. In both poems, the shedding of lamb's blood goes unredeemed. Mailie's master, despite the ewe's death, never agrees to stop tethering his lambs, and Willy's mistress, "distant and deaf to her pet lamb's entreaties for mercy, clearly cares 888 Last Words</page><page sequence="13">more for her ruined ruffle than for her wooly pet.36 Moreover, each personified lamb, though closely adhering in its dying declaration to the stock conventions of the Ars moriendi, nevertheless dies less like a holy savior on the cross than a hapless animal on a r?tisserie. If these poems never quite achieve the status of blasphemy, it maybe because, through their whimsical acts of literary anthropomorphism, they challenge the hubris of even people attempting to die like a god. Insinuating that to die in imitation of Christ is nothing if not presumptuous, the satirical religious ballad might be said to challenge the founding principles of Christian devotional literature no less effectively than the explicitly secular last word poems that appear more than a century later. III. THE BANAL LAST WORD Mock last word ballads detect the sanctimonious in the saintly, the uproarious in the upright. Undermining the confident assertions of devotional deathbed literature, these late eighteenth-century satires foreshadow what will become a much more serious worry for their twentieth-century counterparts: the unpredictability and utter triteness of the everyday deathbed declaration. Most last word poems of the twentieth century attribute the poverty of last words to the numbing effects of modern medicine, which offer few the opportunity to "rage, rage against the dying of the light."37 Poet and critic Sandra Gilbert, herself no stranger to the devastations of modern death, articulates its losses best: "most of the dying do go gentle?or sedated?or anyway barely conscious into death's mysterious 'good night.'"38 By the end of the nineteenth century, death's increasing bureaucratization?its rationalization, depersonalization, and objectification?brings with it a growing recognition that dying speeches may always have been much duller than presumed.39 In openly confronting the tendency of last words to be hackneyed, tired, unimaginative, unoriginal, or simply unintentional, the banal last word poem interjects a note of frank, some times jaded realism into the history of traditional mortuary verse. Adrienne Rich, in her poem "The Parting," laments that "Last words, tears, most often/come wrapped as the everyday/familiar fail ure."40 This everyday familiar failure of last words to live up to their press can be attributed partly to the problem of knowing, even on one's deathbed, exactly when one has entered the fateful hour. "How shall we know it is the last good-by?" American poet Louise Chandler Moulton, a descendent of Calvinists, ponders in the opening octave of her fin-de-si?cle sonnet: Diana Fuss 889</page><page sequence="14">How shall we know it is the last good-by? The skies will not be darkened in that hour, No sudden blight will fall on leaf or flower, No single bird will hush its careless cry, And you will hold my hands, and smile or sigh Just as before. Perchance the sudden tears In your dear eyes will answer to my fears; But there will come no voice of prophecy,? No voice to whisper, "Now, and not again, Space for last words, last kisses, and last prayer, For all the wild, unmitigated pain Of those who, parting, clasp hands with despair:"? "Who knows?" we say, but doubt and fear remain, Would any choose to part thus unaware?"41 The turn into the concluding sestet answers that we can never know "it is the last good-by": "there will come no voice of prophecy,? / No voice to whisper, "Now, and not again." For Moulton, such uncertainty deprives us of the full significance and experience of last words. The final goodbye can only be truly meaningful if all parties involved un derstand that there will be no further opportunities for "last words, last kisses, and last prayer." No one, in the poet's own concluding surmise, would "choose to part thus unaware." Or would they? Moulton s question is more than merely rhetorical: "Would any choose to part thus unaware?" Presumably some might, and for the first time in the history of the consolation poem, a new possibility has been broached: are unconscious or random last words necessarily any less meaningful than prepared or sanctioned ones? Or could it be the other way around: is it the most devout and familiar last words that have been, all along, the most habitual and "unaware"? In many ways still an earnest consolation lyric, one that places full-hearted faith in the power of "the last good-by," Moulton's traditional poem is also a surprisingly modern one, questioning how much control we truly have over the staging, timing, and content of our final farewells, and giving anxious voice to the compelling desire to know (in advance, in the moment, or in retrospect) when any spoken or written words are, in truth, last words.42 The problem banality poses for a continuing tradition of Ars moriendi literature only intensifies in cases of sudden death, when words never intended to be last words are made to shoulder the heavy burden of consolation. In the first major work of her career?an early elegy and last word poem called "Interim"?Edna St. Vincent Millay adopts the 890 Last Words</page><page sequence="15">persona of a grief-stricken husband struggling to make sense of the prosaic last words of his wife, who died unexpectedly after scribbling in her diary, "I picked the first sweet-pea today." How strange it seems That of all words these are the words you chose! And yet a simple choice; you did not know You would not write again. If you had known? But then, it does not matter,?and indeed If you had known there was so little time You would have dropped your pen and come to me And this page would be empty, and some phrase Other than this would hold my wonder now. Yet, since you could not know, and it befell That these are the last words your fingers wrote, There is a dignity some might not see In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea today."43 The grieving speaker at first detects "dignity" in these ordinary dying words, before realizing over the course of the poem that their "trivial expression" is in truth "hideously dignified." Millay's 1914 "Interim," which historically stands at the join between Edwardian faith and modern skepticism, openly rejects the consolations of Christianity, or what the poet calls in her blank-verse elegy "that frenzied faith." Secular mourning practices are also found wanting, as the poem's newly bereaved husband refuses to disturb or insult the dead by weeping over his wife, planting flowers on her grave, or conjuring up her ghost. The convention of last words is the one mourning tradition Millay's inconsolable speaker labors to hold onto, though eventually he discov ers that he has displaced the meaning of his wife's unassuming last words as surely as he unknowingly discarded the season's first flower that she picked for him: Twas much like any other flower to me, Save that it was the first. I did not know, Then, that it was the last. If I had known? But then, it does not matter. Strange how few, After all's said and done, the things that are Of moment. A last word, like a last love token, may be less a sign from the dead than a consolatory fiction of the living. In the end, Millay's "Interim" discredits the power of last words to tell us anything much at all about life, death, or the proper way to grieve. Refusing to view last words as either the sum of a life or the prediction of an afterlife, Millay Diana Fuss 891</page><page sequence="16">presents them instead as simply innocent and inconsequential words, random words whose significance remains difficult, if not impossible, to recuperate. Twenty-five years after Millay's fictional dramatic monologue, Wil liam Carlos Williams publishes an autobiographical poetic dialogue even less sentimental than the despairing "Interim." In "The Last Words of My English Grandmother" (1939), Williams vividly recalls the dreary sadness of his maternal grandmother's deathbed. This de-idealized portrait of modern dying replaces the spare and tidy Victorian sickroom with a dirty and disordered bedroom, less a final resting place than a temporary waystation on the now obligatory trip to the hospital.44 There were some dirty plates And a glass of milk Beside her on a small table Near the rank, disheveled bed? Wrinkled and nearly blind She lay and snored Rousing with anger in her tones To cry for food, Gimme something to eat? They're starving me? I'm all right I won't go to the hospital. No, no, no Give me something to eat Let me take you to the hospital, I said and after you are well you can do as you please. She smiled, Yes you do what you please first then I can do what I please? Oh, oh, oh! she cried as the ambulance men lifted her to the stretcher? Is this what you call making me comfortable? By now her mind was clear? Oh you think you're smart you young people, 892 Last Words</page><page sequence="17">she said, but I'll tell you you don't know anything. Then we started. On the way we passed a long row of elms. She looked at them awhile out of the ambulance window and said, What are all those fuzzy-looking things out there? Trees? Well, I'm tired of them and rolled her head away.45 Last words, Williams insists with this arresting poem, are not always profound; they can be negative, defensive, sarcastic, angry, imperious, and accusatory. They can also be simply ordinary, as the grandmother's weary "I'm tired of them" illustrates. This is not to say, however, that banal last words are devoid of poetic meaning; only that, for a poet like Williams, preoccupied with the immediate, the tangible, and the ordi nary, banality is consequential precisely by virtue of its inconsequence. Everything about the poem?from its unrhymed iambic trimeter (which breaks down early and never fully recovers) to its metaphorical invoca tion of all five senses (rank smell, impaired vision, raised voice, acute hunger, sensitive touch)?aggressively advance the theme of a failing body, dying an embittered death. In a series of tonal shifts offset by the unwavering emotional equilibrium of the poet himself, rage tempers to petulance as the old woman peevishly dismisses the passing trees visible from the ambulance window. Even the actual trees?ordinary American elms rather than the symbolic yews and willows of traditional mortuary verse?testify to the unromantic and unhappy demise of Wil liams's ill-tempered yet indestructible grandmother, who by the time of her death had already outlived all four of her children. Importantly, Williams writes two versions of this powerful family elegy. In the first and longer draft, written fifteen years earlier, the poet includes a crucial detail missing from the final poem: a direct reference to his grandmother's dying request for "Mother Eddy's Science and Health."46 Emily Dickinson Wellcome, it turns out, was a practicing Christian Scientist who did not believe in doctors or modern medicine. Taken to the hospital against her will, Williams's dying grandmother had good reason to be hostile; her grandson, an aspiring doctor, was depriving her of the one thing she desired most?an undisturbed death Diana Fuss 893</page><page sequence="18">at home. In choosing to omit this critical piece of information from the poem's final draft, Williams, years after this traumatic family death, may well have sought to absolve himself of guilt and responsibility for ignoring his grandmother's dying wish. The last words of Williams's grandmother, recorded in a moving ambulance, reflect the new reality of dying modern, in which hospital deaths increasingly replace home deaths, and medical professionals become the new custodians of the dying. As numerous historians have noted, in the twentieth century the good death has been replaced by a shameful death?a new type of dying that is as solitary and secretive as the Victorian deathbed was once public and performative. If poetry's banal last words retain deep significance after all, it is by testifying to the banalization of death itself in the modern period. And yet, as the deathbed slowly recedes from view, early twentieth-century poets like Millay and Williams nonetheless choose to hold on to the convention of last words, concluding, in the end, that banal last words are still better than no last words. IV. THE NEW LAST WORD Remarkably, as death is driven into hiding and the deathbed virtu ally disappears from public consciousness, the convention of last words survives into the present, outliving the historical circumstances that produced it. The dying voice proves to be a surprisingly adaptable one, able, through the animating properties of language, to assume voice-altering and shape-shifting form. In twentieth-century poetry, last words endure by becoming gestural last words, humorous last words, or someone else's last words. While the traditional deathbed may have largely disappeared, belief in the power and importance of last words has not. Few it appears, and poets least of all, wish to die "verbally intestate."47 More than any other body of contemporary literature, AIDS writing is especially invested in reviving the deathbed and restoring authority to last words. Often estranged from family, concerned over inheritance rights, or anxious about funeral arrangements, gay men on their deathbeds have long turned to the power of last words to wield whatever control they can over an uncertain postmortem future. And yet AIDS poetry rejects the overtly Evangelical conventions of Protestant deathbed literature, striving not merely to secularize the genre but to sanitize it of the preacherly cant that even now tends to judge all AIDS deaths as bad deaths, signs of sinful behavior or moral 894 Last Words</page><page sequence="19">decrepitude. The single most important feature of an Evangelical good death?spiritual readiness and reconciliation?is exposed, in an age of epidemic, as little more than a tired anachronism. And when at last the whole death was assured, Drugs having failed, and when you had endured Two weeks of an abominable constraint, You faced it equably, without complaint, Unwhimpering, but not at peace with it. You'd lived as if your time was infinite: You were not ready and not reconciled.48 Nothing, Gunn's "Lament" admonishes, could possibly reconcile one to a death as arbitrary and agonizing as AIDS. The very idea of being "at peace" with such a premature passing is a cruel joke, even a literal one in poems like Greg Johnson's elegy on the death of his friend, Ted Rosen, who with his last ragged breath in a hospital intensive care unit manages to get off a line for the ages: "Many are called, you know, but few are Rosen."49 Vowing to be memorable if it kills him, Ted Rosen reworks the deathbed exit line into a borscht belt punch line, further challenging Protestantism's historical monopoly on last words. If the original literature on dying well emerged during the late medieval plague years as manuals for those left to manage their final hour alone, then this newer, more secular Ars moriendi returns the genre to its roots, once again serving as guides for those often dying without the benefit of clergy or family, during history's newest and most lethal pandemic.50 AIDS poetry revives one of the most impor tant features of the late medieval Ars moriendi: its central emphasis not just on the words of the dying but on the offices of the bystander. The very first line of the 1497 Here begynneth a lytell treaty se called Ars moriendi counsels its readers that, in the likelihood of death, it is vital to have a "special friend" to aid and pray for you.51 A historian of the Ars moriendi notes that this confusion of audience characterizes nearly all early deathbed manuals: "ostensibly writing to teach a man to die, the author sometimes sounds as if he were teaching a man to help a friend to die."52 Nowhere is this truer in contemporary poetry than in the most passionate of Paul Monette's many elegies on the death of his lover Roger Horwitz, entitled "No Goodbyes." Despite a title that appears to refuse the ritual of the final farewell, this poem simply shifts the burden of last words from the dying to the watcher. If modern medicine has deprived the dying of a chance to deliver last words, then it is the friend's responsibility to perform this service in his place. Diana Fuss 895</page><page sequence="20">At 4 you took the turn WAIT WAIT I AM THE SENTRY HERE nothing passes as long as I'm where I am we go on death is a lonely hole two can leap it or else or else there is nothing this man is mine he's an ancient Greek like me I do all the negotiating while he does battle we are war and peace in a single bed53 Our deaths are the most singular thing about us, philosophy now tells us; no one can die in our place.54 Quite so, Monette's poem seems to respond, but like the ancient Greeks one can at least die accompa nied, with a sentry keeping guard by one's side. The watcher standing sentry must do what his charge no longer can: deliver the last words which will direct the dying safely across the abyss. As Melissa Zeiger has observed of AIDS poetry, the traditional elegiac distance between mourner and mourned begins to dissolve when the mourner may also be infected.55 "We are war and peace in a single bed," Monette remarks in "No Goodbyes," effectively erasing the line between the dying and the living. Writing out of certain knowledge of his own impending mortality, Monette climbs into the actual deathbed to negotiate a truce on Roger's behalf, using the powerful agency of his own dying voice to give final safe passage to his lover. Contemporary cancer elegies are no less invested in preserving some of the more traditional features of the deathbed, openly embracing many of the observances venerated by Victorian mortuary culture. Two deeply affecting poetry volumes, Douglas Dunn's Elegies (1985) and Donald Hall's Without (1999), share AIDS poetry's respect not only for the all-important devotional offices of the friend but also for the courageous physical labors of the dying. Recalling the nineteenth century memorial diary?which recorded, in often excruciating detail, the daily and even hourly activities of the sickroom?both books re count the long illness and last days of a wife dying of cancer. Dunn's poem "Thirteen Steps and the Thirteenth of March" remembers the many "days of grief/Before the grief when, "like a butler," he served tea, sherry, biscuits, and cake to endless streams of visitors, anxious to pay their respects to his wife Lesley. Invoking Dickinsonian discre tion and decorum, Dunn declines to reveal the content of his wife's final goodbyes, electing instead to record their salutary effect on her watchers who, one by one, depart from the deathbed "with their fears of dying amended." "Turning down painkillers for lucidity," Lesley Dunn refuses to be cheated out of her deathbed scene: 896 Last Words</page><page sequence="21">Honesty at all costs. She drew up lists, Bequests, gave things away. It tore my heart out. Her friends assisted at this tidying In a conspiracy of women.56 Feeling partly excluded by the authority women have long wielded over the deathbed, Douglas Dunn, like any good Protestant mourner, pronounces his wife's slow wasting a sad but nevertheless "beautiful" death.57 Donald Hall's Without, an elegy for the poet Jane Kenyon published three years after her death from leukemia, recalls similar deathbed rituals after Kenyon, too, "threw her medicines into the trash." Hus band and wife spend their final days together editing a collection of Kenyon's poems, picking hymns for her funeral, and co-authoring and revising her obituary, before summoning "the oldest and dearest, to say goodbye." Even more candid than Dunn, Hall records for poster ity his wife's last word ("O.K."), last kiss, last look, last spasm, and last smell, as well as his own last gesture?closing the corpse's eyes with his thumb.58 Literature's newest deathbed poems, like the early deathbed diaries that inspire them, never hesitate to describe for their audience the physical transformations that they see. In so doing, they bring the most intimate details of bodily death back into public view. What is new then about "the new last word" poems is not so much their bold originality as their subtle familiarity. These poems abjure Ezra Pound's dictum to "make it new" in favor of Robert Lowell's invitation to "tell what happened." As the poet Dana Levin might put it, what is new about the new last word poems is their refusal to fetishize the new. Writing against contemporary poetry's too ready embrace of the first, the experimental, or the avant-garde, Levin has recently cautioned: "When Pound tells us to make it new we shouldn't first ask how?we should first ask why"59 AIDS and cancer poets pose precisely this query, finding in the tradition of consolation literature powerful paradigms for reviving the lost art of the deathbed. As these contemporary elegists show, last words can survive, in somewhat altered form, even in the most hostile of modern environments, including the sterile seclusion of a hospital ICU. By focusing on the physical realities of the deathbed, and by reassigning responsibility for last words from the dying to the living, late twentieth-century elegy keeps an expiring literary tradition alive long enough for the deathbed to finally make a comeback, eventually reclaiming last words as a uniquely shared privilege between mourner and mourned. Like consumption a century before, cancer and AIDS provide the physical conditions necessary for Diana Fuss 897</page><page sequence="22">last words; both are gradual and often fatal diseases, in which the dying might remain fully cognizant to the end. Modernity's chronic illness elegies thus announce the latest shift in mortality's cultural landscape, as end-stage patients increasingly choose to forego consciousness numbing drugs in order to participate, once again, in the deathbed's most time-honored rites. V. THE LAST LAST WORD In concluding this investigation of the dying voice in poetry, I would like to give poets themselves the last word. Exactly what are last words to a poet? And why has the poetry of last words lasted? Poetry's abiding interest in last words is partly a function of the capacity of last words to mimic poetry. Like any good poem, last words reflect a heightened awareness of audience, an acute concentration of language, and a pro found intensification of meaning. A deathbed declaration, no less than a poetic utterance, draws power from its highly charged investment in a comparatively small number of words. Crafted to have special and lasting significance, last words, like finished poems, command our at tention while deflecting our response. The most salient feature of last words might even be said to characterize literature as a whole: with the literal and figurative death of the author, last words remain unchal lenged, inviolate. The power of last words derives precisely from their lastness, from the structural impossibility of dialogue or debate. But what of the premature last word?the last word that arrives too soon, gets ahead of itself, outlives the moment? Here, too, last words retain their fundamental unanswerabilty. As the very existence of a robust tradition of last word poetry might suggest, last words can never come too soon. Dying declarations take preparation, modifica tion, and imagination. As early practitioners of last words knew so well, because we do not know when our death may be upon us, and because we may not be conscious when it happens, last words ideally should be executed in advance.60 For poets, long invested in Wordsworthian visions of immortality, it is perhaps more important that last words last long than come last. Must I be the scribe of each word I speak, never knowing if it will be my last? Or should someone else be my full-time scribe (in case deathfits keep me from writing them down) Always ready to put ear to my lips in case it should be a whisper? 898 Last Words</page><page sequence="23">"Rosebud." "More weight." "More light." "Now it is come." "Now I die." "So this is death?" "Thank you." "Farewell!" "Hurrah!" "Boo!" "Can this last long?" "It is finished." Or like H. G. Wells?"I'm alright. Go away." Or like Sam Goldwyn?"I never thought I'd live to see the day." Or like John Wolcott when asked if anything could be done for him? "Bring back my youth." I tell myself what my last words will be, Hoping I don't get stage fright. Hoping I don't get laryngitis. Hoping someone will hear them. Hoping I'm not interrupted. Hoping I don't forget what they are. From now on everything I say and write Are my last words.61 In the final stanzas of this fretful poem, Antler, a former poet laureate of Milwaukee, not only obsesses over his own last words, but wonders how they will stack up against an entire tradition of famous last words, including the most famous last words in literary history, Goethe's "More light."62 Determined not to miss his death like he missed his birth, this Whitmanesque poet vows to treat all his words as last words. The reasoning is logical enough: if all a poet's words aspire to be last words, then every poem is potentially a deathbed poem, a written guarantee that no poet will ever die without a lasting literary legacy. Rainer Maria Rilke thought much the same, insisting in his eighteenth elegy that "Whatever we do, we are in the posture / of one who is about to de part." Or again: "that is how we live, forever / taking our leave."63 For these poets, all words are last words because we are never not taking our leave; being itself is defined by our perpetual passing out of it. Yet how exactly do words last? In a posthumously published poem penned just before her suicide, Anne Sexton depicts last words in naturalistic terms, insisting that words, like ripened fruit, must be ar tificially preserved. "I have on a mask in order to write my last words / and they are just for you, and I will place them / in the icebox saved for vodka and tomatoes, / and perhaps they will last." Behind her hygienic mask, Sexton fears that, despite all precautions, words can go rancid or stale before they even "reach the icebox / and its hopeful eternity."64 Picturing how last words might last, Sexton's poetic conceit Diana Fuss 899</page><page sequence="24">for literary preservation?the icebox?articulates a powerful temporal contradiction embedded in the very phrase "last words": last words survive precisely because they are frozen, final, spent, quotable, repro ducible. It is the chill finality of last words that secures, paradoxically, their enduring afterlife. Through citation, the dying words of others live on, conferring responsibility and authority on the one who preserves them?a fact that goes a long way toward explaining poets' particular fondness for commemorating the dying words of other poets. Twentieth-century writers as different as Lawrence Durrell, Theodore Roethke, Linda Pastan, and David Ray have all devoted poems to Goethe's dying words, seeing in his cry for "More Light!" ("Mehr Lichtl") an invita tion, if not a command, to literary succession: "Friend, you exist, and you lift me up now. / Is that not what Goethe said to the light?" asks David Ray, his very name an embodiment of enlightenment.65 These poets use the convention of last words to insert themselves into liter ary history, claiming, as so many elegists do, an inherited mantle of poetic authority. If last words can never arrive too soon, they also can never arrive too late. Last words are often (if not always) apocryphal words?literary or cultural fictions bequeathed by the living onto the dead. Of the many deceased poets discussed in this essay, almost none left last words that can be easily authenticated. Deathbed sayings featured in last word anthologies rarely match up with those recorded in biographies, which may themselves be extravagant exercises in mythmaking, imaginative attempts to make the circumstances of writers' deaths fully consonant with the meaning of their life's work. Lydia Sigourney's widely an thologized last words, "I love everybody," duplicate a dying declaration from Sigourney's own Margaret and Henrietta, a. biographical sketch published three decades earlier; as Ann Douglas notes, in her final days Sigourney "re-enacted a deathbed scene which she had in part invented."66 Sigourney's saintly proclamation of universal love does not, however, appear to have been her actual last words; in a postscript to the poet's posthumously published autobiography Letters of Life, Sigourney's daughter reports two far less edifying final utterances: "I am so tired, so tired" and "Thank you."67 Last word anthologies record two completely different final sayings for Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns, who reportedly exclaimed either "Don't let the awkward squad fire over me" or (in response to a creditor's bill) "That damned rascal!"68 Neither message though was delivered from Burns's actual deathbed, where the poet, in his final delirium, may have done 900 Last Words</page><page sequence="25">no more than twice call out his brother Gilbert's name. Contrary to literary mythology, poets' last words are rarely more profound than anyone else's. Sean Day-Lewis, who kept a diary of his father's "oppres sive last days," cannot conceal his disappointment when, alone at the deathbed for a final farewell, C. Day-Lewis merely thanks him "for a lovely afternoon," to which his son responds "see you soon."69 In cases of a poet's sudden or sensational death, in which inadequate last words or no last words are provided, the temptation to make poetry stand in for inappropriate or absent dying declarations proves too much for most biographers to resist. Edna St. Vincent Millay, who broke her neck in an accidental fall down a staircase, left no last words, which did not deter her biographer from finding them in a notebook the poet was carrying at the time, containing a draft of an elegy for her deceased husband: "I will not flaw perfection with my grief. / Handsome, this day: no matter who has died."70 More speculation than fact, these artfully selected last lines convey the intended irony: at the moment Millay finally manages to overcome her intense grief for her dead husband, she herself joins him in a post-elegiac afterlife. Sylvia Plath's suicide note, "Please call Dr. Horder," would seem to offer far more genuine last words, a rare instance of a verifiable, indisputable dying message. Yet finding little to inspire in Plath's final instructions, biographers inevitably turn to the first lines of Plath's last poem to summarize her death: "The woman is perfected. / Her dead / Body wears the smile of accomplishment." Judged by one critic to be Plath's "poetic epitaph," the poem "Edge" is considered a more triumphant and eloquent ex planation of the poet's purposeful death than the mundane message to call her doctor.71 Anne Sexton, who left no suicide note, is similarly "perfected" by her poetry, in this case an uncompleted poem called "The Green Room" found later in her purse, or even the entire volume The Awful Rowing Toward God, which Sexton had corrected in galley form with Maxine Kumin the afternoon of her death. For biographers attempting to explain a poet's suicide, it appears that there are no more sufficient last words than the poet's own final verses, a position that flies in the face of Sexton's insistence to Plath that "suicide is, after all, the opposite of the poem."72 Poets, too, are not averse to dramatizing another writer's last words. Creative citation can give way to outright fabrication in a poem like Tom Clark's "The Last Words of Hart Crane as He Becomes One with the Gulf," which purports to be Crane's final thoughts right before he jumps overboard.73 Written in the first person and recounting, in broken sonnet form, Crane s own broken spirit and drunken despair, Diana Fuss 901</page><page sequence="26">Clark's act of poetic ventriloquism may do no more, in the end, than reveal that a suicide without a suicide note is intolerable to survivors. Last words are intended to be a lifeline, not to the dying but to the living, whose chief means of respecting the dead has always been to quote the dead. Putting words into the dead man's mouth, as Clark freely does, can be viewed as not merely a hostile act but a homicidal one, killing off the dead all over again by refusing to let them speak. Yet pure citation is not without its own dangers. As Jacques Derrida cautions in his memorial tribute to Roland Barthes, while an avoidance of quotation simply erases death in a triumph of narcissism, a reliance on quotation merely returns us to death in an excess of fidelity. For the survivor, the poetic stewardship of last words is never uncompro mised, even if one somehow manages to avoid the ever-present risks of simplification, totalization, calculation, and appropriation.74 Given these very real dangers, one is compelled to wonder anew: why does poetry remain drawn to last words? Perhaps because last words are simply another name for poetry, another way to describe the loss of self, or sense of surrender, which all literary endeavor demands. "When I die, may I be taken in the midst of my work," Ovid once fervently pleaded.75 Last word poems reveal that the romantic notion of dying a writer's death, expiring with pen in hand, is for literature a simple redundancy. Writing is dying, a way to experience, over and over again, one's own sudden, inexplicable disappearance. As the very term Ars moriendi reminds us, Plath was by no means the first to suggest that "dying is an art." But is not the inverse also true: is not art a dying? As the many poems surveyed in this essay might suggest, the Ars moriendi cuts both ways. All literature, and arguably poetry in particular, demands a willingness to disappear into the text, to pass, in Heideggerian fashion, from being out of time. i?Whoever delves into verse dies," Maurice Blanchot bluntly ac knowledges in The Space of Literature, a book that in many ways reads like an extended commentary on St?phane Mallarm?'s conviction that to be a poet is to be lost in the "abyss" of Nothingness. While such a statement may be too totalizing to describe all poetry, or even all mortuary verse, Blanchot s conviction that a poem requires a "volun tary death" does capture, quite precisely, the view of last word poems that the passion that drives poetry is not the knowledge that the poem will come to an end, but the fear that it may never end. The terror of literary confinement happens the moment the poet realizes that to remain any longer inside the poem is to "die in the undertaking."76 Could the poem be the very opposite of suicide for the simple rea 902 Last Words</page><page sequence="27">son that poetic closure provides a way out? Without closure, no poet would survive the loss of self which a genre like the last word poem insistently demands. Mortality, then, is associated not with poetic closure but with poetic composition. Whereas poetic composition denotes an act of dying, poetic closure represents not death, but the defiance of death?a running for one's life. Perhaps this is why so many last word poems, surprisingly, do not end with last words but begin with them. More often than not, poems which memorialize specific last words position them in an epigraph, title, opening line, or first stanza.77 While some poems, satires especially, are comprised entirely of dying speeches, only the last word ballads, with their strong narrative structure, tend to place last words at the very end of the poem, though even here, they are often contained within a recurrent refrain. In the twentieth century, the poetry of last words must negotiate the modern preference for anti-closure, poetic endings that favor ir resolution and indeterminacy over the conclusiveness and clarity that last words would seem to provide.78 Of the poets discussed here, only Williams, celebrated in his own time for his "open verse," chooses to close his poem with his grandmother's actual last words ("Well, I'm tired of them"). Invoking the strong closure that only death can promise, this poem comes to rest more securely than most, yet it is a soft landing all the same, as the voice of the mature Williams extends the poem s final line with one more narrative detail, "and rolled her head away." These final words, which figure the dying woman's literal withdrawal from the external world, also bring the reader firmly back into that world, into the time and space of the here and now, the place of the survivor. Williams further resists the pull towards teleology by placing the words "last words" in his title, reinforcing the view, prevalent through out last word poetry, that the final words of the sick and dying are valuable, not so much as means to poetic closure, than as incitements to poeticize in the first place. If last words tend to gravitate toward the beginning of poems, their early placement suggests that, for poets at least, last words are never the last last word. As James Richardson puts it in his second-to-last poetic aphorism from Interglacial, "there is no last line we don't have to go beyond."79 Princeton University Diana Fuss 903</page><page sequence="28">NOTES 1C. Day Lewis, "Last Words," in The Complete Poems of C. Day Lewis (London: Sinclair-Stevenson, 1992), 529-30. 2 See Pat Jalland, Death in the Victorian Family (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1996), 26. Helen Burns's longing to return to her "last home," in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, provides one of the best known examples of a good death in British fiction. On Jane Eyre as the "locus classicus" of Victorian deathbed literature, see Michael Wheeler, Death and the Future Life in Victorian Literature and Theology (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1990), 38-39. Wheeler argues that "the last words of the dying . . . had a special significance for the Victorians, and became something of a literary conven tion in their own right" (30). The lingering passing of little Eva St. Clare in Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Toms Cabin provides the most famous American model of a virtuous death, designed in part to show that "some people die young in order to aid in the spiritual development of those whom they leave behind" (Lora Romero, Home Fronts: Domesticity and Its Critics in the Antebellum United States [Durham: Duke Univ. Press, 1997], 22). Romero further notes in her canny reading of Stowe's preco cious consumptive that, in antebellum America, "a woman's dying gospel is perhaps even more potent than her living one" (22). 3 For exemplars of the perfect Christian death, Victorians turned back to the Sev enteenth Century and to its flourishing literature of the Ars moriendi. Already in its seventh American edition by 1836, Reverend Charles Drelincourt's 1651 French Protestant guide to dying well, entitled The Christians Consolations Against the Fear of Death (Philadelphia: James Kay, Jun &amp; Brother, 1836), was a common bedside companion in nineteenth-century sickrooms. Intended in part to relieve the dying of the tremendous burden of last words, Drelincourt's deathbed manual offered prayers for every conceivable type of death, from dying as a king, general, or judge, to dying young, on the battlefield, or in a foreign country. Victorians also were drawn to the example of John Bunyan, author o? Pilgrim's Progress, whose dying words were report edly found among his papers after Bunyan's own sudden death from fever in 1688. Bunyan's last words, written years before his actual death, provide not only proof of his spiritual readiness to his redeemer but a direct admonishment and exhortation to his sons to do their duty to God, to their mother, and to one another. See Bunyan, Rest for a Wearied Soul: or; The pilgrim at his journey's end: being the last legacy of John Bunyan, of Bedfordshire, left to his children when he lay on his death-bed (New London, Connecticut: T. Green, 1765). 4 Jalland, 34-35. 5 The post-Enlightenment interest in last words is predominantly a Protestant tradi tion. In nineteenth-century Catholicism, last rites trumped last words as the necessary determinant of a good death. The Catholic deathbed accorded far greater authority to clergy than did the Evangelical deathbed, where the faith of the dying alone, rather than the power of priestly intervention, was believed to secure salvation. Subject even on the deathbed to the sacramental offices of the priest, Catholics appear to have had considerably less agency or responsibility for dying well, although Protestants too felt dependent on others?family especially?to help spiritually ready them for death. For more on the differences between Protestant and Catholic deathbeds in the nineteenth century, see Jalland, 31-33. Philippe Aries's monumental The Hour of Our Death: The Classic History of Western Attitudes Toward Death Over the Last One Thousand Years (New York: Knopf, 1981), while aiming for full historical coverage, bases its account of western deathbed rituals predominantly on Catholic deathbed traditions. 904 Last Words</page><page sequence="29">6 Priscilla Maurice, Sickness, Its Trials and Blessings, to which is appended Prayers for the Sick and Dying (New York: Thomas N. Stanford, 1856), 322. Maurice at times appears troubled by the aggressive behavior of friends and family at the deathbed, eager to receive last words from the dying. She cautions deathbed attendants not to ask the loved one too many questions, not to literally prod or touch them, and not to say anything in the room they would not normally wish the sick person to hear, for "hearing is the sense that last goes, and first returns" (321-23). See also Sursum Coda: Hymns for the Sick and Suffering, ed. Mary Wilder Foote Tileston (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1877), 265-91. Most of the poems included in Tileston's "last hour" section are composed by women poets, including Alice Carey, Eliza Scudder, Dora Greenwell, and Elizabeth Charles. As primary attendants in the sickroom, women witnessed many a deathbed scene, and frequently wrote about what they saw. Lydia Sigourney, for one, devotes an entire memoir, and many poems, to the short life and dying words of her nineteen-year old son Andrew. An aspiring writer who died a lingering death from tuberculosis in 1850, Andrew wound his watch and notified his family and friends that "at twelve o'clock, I shall be gone" (The Faded Hour [New York: Robert Carter &amp; Brothers, 1853], 235). 7J. C. Sharp briefly summarizes for his Victorian readers John Keble's theory of prosody in the preface to The Christian Year (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1827). Keble, who held the Oxford Chair of Poetry from 1831 to 1841, affirms that "high and tender feeling controlled and modified by a certain reserve is the very soul of poetry" (Sharp, vii). For a fuller introduction to Keble's thoughts on prosody, see Keble, Keble's Lectures on Poetry, 1832-1841, trans. Edward Kershaw Francis, 2 vol. (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1912). Wheeler, in his Death and the Future Life in Victorian Literature and Theology, notes the importance of Keble's widely reprinted verse volume while Jalland further observes, in her Death in the Victorian Family, that Keble's devotional book of poems maintained its immense popularity even against such formidable challengers as Alfred Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam. See Wheeler, 57; and Jalland, 281-83. 8 Lydia Sigourney, The Weeping Willow (Hartford: Henry S. Parsons, 1847), v. 9 Emily Dickinson is especially fond of the trope of the "dying eye," which appears most prominently in the poems "I've seen a Dying Eye" (The Poems of Emily Dickinson, ed. R. W Franklin, 3 vol. [Cambridge: Belknap Press Harvard, 1998], 648; hereafter abbreviated P and cited parenthetically by page number), "Dying! To be afraid of them" (P, 946), and "Robbed by Death?but that was easy" (P, 838). For the Em ily Dickinson poems discussed in this essay, I follow the chronology and numbering employed in Franklin's edition. 10 Henry Ware, "Seasons of Prayer," in The American Common-place Book of Poetry, ed. George B. Cheever (Boston: Carter and Hendee, 1832), 143-44. 11 Nancy Lee Beaty, in The Craft of Dying: A Study in the Literary Tradition of the Ars moriendi in England (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1970), argues that of all the helpful offices which bystanders could perform at the deathbed?including providing a crucifix and holy water, or persuading the sick that there is little time to waste?prayer on behalf of the dying was considered by devotional literature as the most important role of the witness. See Beaty, 29. 12 Thomas Westwood, "Last Words," in his Poems (London: H.

Press, 1999). Last words, Seeman notes, transformed "ordinarily marginalized female speech into the center of male and cleri cal attention" (75). Last words were also viewed quite differently by clergy and laity: "ministers argued that they demonstrated the possibility that a person was saved, while most laypeople regarded them as proof that a person was saved" (Seeman, 65). 16 Jackson's own last wishes (which included her strong desire that her husband marry her niece) were in fact fulfilled. The rustic grave on Cheyenne Mountain, the plain granite tombstone, and the simple funeral proceedings all accorded with the direc tions Jackson enumerates in her poem "Last Words," read aloud at the gravesite per the poet's request. See Kate Phillips, Helen Hunt Jackson: A Literary Life (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 2003), 271-74. 17 Lydia Howard Sigourney, "Last Words of an Indian Chief," in Pocahontas, and Other Poems (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1841), 181-82. 18 Sigourney, Letters to Young Ladies (Hartfield: P.

The "bury me/bury me not" lyrics may well be the most political poems in nineteenth-century literature, for in an era when the dead were believed to live in their tombs, nothing incited public passions more than the (mis)treatment of dead bodies. 21 Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, "Bury Me in a Free Land," Anti-Slavery Bugle, 20 November 1858, n.p. This pre-Civil War poem sees the land itself as so contaminated by the blood of slavery as to be unfit for human burial. Yet, in "Sacred Land Regained: Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and The Massachusetts Fifty-Fourth,' a Lost Poem" (Pennsylvania History 62 [1995]: 90-110), Donald Yacovone convincingly argues that the 1858 "Bury Me in a Free Land," with its strong dismissal of a nation s soil poisoned by the blood of the lash, needs to be read in relation to a later 1863 poem memorializing the first army unit of free blacks, whose fight against slavery during the Civil War now transformed and redeemed the American land through blood voluntarily shed. 22 Shira Wolosky, Major Voices: 19th Century American Women's Poetry, ed.

This useful anthology includes Harper's poem on pages 163-64. 23 Scholars disagree on whether or not Dickinson attended more than one deathwatch, her mother's in 1882 (just four years before the poet's own passing). The poet was, however, abundantly familiar with the Evangelical literature on the subject. 24 See Austin Phelps, The Still Hour: or, Communion with God (Boston: Gould and Lincoln, 1860). 25 See Louise Pound, American Ballads and Songs (New York: C.

Gilbert, Inventions of Farewell: A Book of Elegies (New York: W W. Norton &amp; Company, 2001), 35. Gilbert describes the tragic death of her husband, just hours after routine surgery, in her memoir Wrongful Death (New York: W. W Norton &amp; Company, 1995), and no less movingly in her ambitious scholarly study Deaths Door: Modern Dying and the Ways We Grieve (New York: W W Norton &amp; Company, 2006). All three books, Gilbert suggests, have been attempts to claim her grief "at a historical moment when death was in some sense unspeakable" (Deaths Door, xix). 39 On the bureaucratization of death in the twentieth century, see Jahan Ramazani's Poetry of Mourning: The Modern Elegy from Hardy to Heaney (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1994). Ramazani locates the modern desire to impose order and dis cipline on dying "not only in such three-dimensional spaces as the funeral parlor, the cemetery, the hospital, the war monument, and the columbarium, but also in such two-dimensional spaces as the newspaper, television, and film" (18). 40 Adrienne Rich, "The Parting: II," in her Collected Early Poems: 1950-1970 (New York: WW Norton &amp; Company, 1993), 274.

According to an account provided by friend and fellow writer Harriet Prescott Spofford, Moulton died "unaware of the immanence of death" and "crossed into that unknown without suffering or recognition of it" (Spofford, introduction to The Poems and Sonnets of Louise Chandler Moulton [Boston: Little, Brown, and Company, 1909], xix). 43 Edna St. Vincent Millay, "Interim," in her Collected Poems, ed.

Flanders explains, "it was recommended that, at the commencement of illness, the sickroom be emptied as much as possible of all furniture and ornaments. In the second half of the century, disease theory indicated that bare, spare rooms were more conducive to patients' recovery" (353). 45 William Carlos Williams, "Last Words of My English Grandmother," in The Collected Poems of William Carlos Williams, ed. A. Walton Litz and Christopher MacGowan, 2 vol. (New York: New Directions, 1986), 1: 464-65. 46 There are two versions of Williams's poem, with the slightly altered titles "Last Words of My Grandmother" and "Last Words of My English Grandmother." I have quoted from the latter; the former?the earlier poem?also appears in The Collected Poems of William Carlos Williams, 1: 253-55. The poem's early incarnation provides the narra tive context missing from the second and shorter version. In the first version, Williams carefully chronicles the time, place, and progression of his grandmother's dementia, from the moment she takes ill to her dying words in the ambulance. Adopting a voice oddly distanced from the events described, the poet initially speaks of his grandmother as "the old lady," "an old woman," or "the dazed old woman," while describing himself as "the boy" or "the young grandson, nineteen/whom she had raised." In the poem's final streamlined revision, Williams drops the third person voice, omits the lengthy narrative exposition, and elects to begin inside the sickroom, on the morning of his grandmother's death. These extensive changes shift the poem's emotional tone from impersonal to personal, and its narrative tenor from story to memory, all the while refocusing the poem around the grandmother's last words proper. 47 Nigel Dennis, "Arthur from the Barge: A Study of Last Words."

O'Connor rejects the common wisdom that the Ars moriendi were written for clergy as manuals for ministering to the sick; the emergence of epidemics in the late Medieval period, she argues, neces sitated that Christians "be given a method of directing their own passing to a happy eternity" (7).

In Monette s book of elegies, composed in the five months following Roger Horwitz's death, warfare imagery permeates even the book's short preface. Writing from "the front lines," the poet explains that he writes of "only one man's passing and one man's cry, a warrior burying a warrior" (xiii). Monette, who himself died of AIDS in 1995, provides a prose account of Horwitz's death in one of the first published AIDS memoirs, Borrowed Time (New York: Avon, 1990). 54 In The Gift of Death, trans. David Wills (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1995), Jacques Derrida writes that "death is very much that which nobody else can undergo or confront in my place," adding that "no one can die for me if 'for me' means instead of me, in my place" (41). 55 See Melissa Zeiger, Beyond Consolation: Death, Sexuality, and the Changing Shapes of Elegy (Ithaca: Cornell Univ.

The churchman's death in 1669 from apoplexy, recounted in the preface to The Christians Consolations Against the Fear of Death, offered readers an inspirational model of proper deathbed decorum. Despite a racking cough and raging fever, Drelincourt managed in his final hours to summon friends and family, recommend his family's care to his son-in-law, settle his domestic affairs, plan his church service, instruct his children to live in perfect union, reward his deathbed attendants, bless his children, and "glorify God to the last gasp." Drelincourt requested that his own "Consolation Prayer for a Dying Minister" be read back to him in his dying hour, demonstrating that this famous minister of the Reformed Church of Paris, who had spent a lifetime instructing others in a holy death, was nothing if not prepared for his own (v-xxiv). 61 Antler, "Last Words," in his Last Words (New York: Ballantine Books, 1986), 13-14. 62 The text most responsible for canonizing "More light!" as Goethe's dying declara tion would appear to be George Henry Lewes s The Life of Goethe (London: Smith, Elder, and Co., 1864), 559.
