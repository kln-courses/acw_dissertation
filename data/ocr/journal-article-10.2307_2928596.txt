<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSE PH KERMAN Representing a Relationship: Notes on a Beethoven Concerto IN E. M. FORSTER'S MISCELLANY Abinger Harvest one of the items is an aggressively familiar essay about music entitled "Word-Making and Sound- Taking." "Capricious insertions of words, parallels, images, jokes, ideas, makes listening to music a rocky and romantic affair," says Forster, and he gives as an example an account of the Andante con moto of Beethoven's Piano Concerto no. 4 in G Major, op. 58: This famous little movement consists of a dialogue between orchestra and piano, the orchestra rough, the piano plaintive, the orchestra gradually calmer. It is very easy music; it strikes or strokes immediately, and elderly gentlemen before myself have called it "Beauty and the Beast." What about Orpheus and the Furies, though? That is the idea that has slipped into my mind to the detriment of the actual musical sounds, and when the music begins I always repair to the entrance of Hell and descend under the guidance of Gluck through diminishing opposition to the Elysian Fields.... The piano turns into Orpheus and via him into Miss Marie Brema, whom I best remember in that role, and the strings and wind, waving less and less their snaky locks, sink at last into acquiescence with true love.' Forster seems to have thought up the Orpheus "program" for himself, unaware that it has been a persistent feature of the concerto's reception history since almost the very beginning. No matter: despite a cultivated naivete about musical matters, misinformation ("strings and wind"), and faded personal memories, there are notable insights in this glancing comment on Beethoven's "famous little movement." The first of these insights has not, I expect, exactly been missed, but has not been-cannot be-sufficiently emphasized. The concerto movement is, to For- ster, "very easy music"; there is a basic gestural, almost premusical quality to it, or at least to much of it. The orchestra and the piano speak separately (for we personify them as speakers) in accents that are as disparate as their instrumental sounds. They alternate, they answer one another, they answer closer and closer. Then one fades and the other prevails. It is very characteristic, this way Beethoven has of representing the primal, the essential, the pith of music. Charles Rosen has remarked how it extends even to the supposedly esoteric matter of tonality; at some point in every Beethoven work, says Rosen, he strips away "all decorative and even expressive elements from the musical material-so that part of the structure of tonality is made to 80 REPRESENTATIONS 39 * Summer 1992 0 THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</page><page sequence="2">appear for a moment naked and immediate."2 One has the same sense of naked immediacy in Beethoven's treatment of simpler musical parameters. The opening of the Ninth Symphony, the end of the Funeral March in the Eroica, the transition to the finale in the Fifth, and other such famous gestural effects-I am not speaking of the complete pieces-are also "very easy," in the sense in which I want to read Forster's predicate. No doubt it is principally response on this primal level (as we may call it) that makes listeners like Forster associate music with nonmusical categories or, as he chose to put it, "insert. . . words, parallels, images, jokes, ideas" into music. Notice the word insert, with its slight implication of the illicit, to say nothing of detriment, also the phrase "a rocky and romantic affair"; Forster had evidently been told by some musician-probably his high-table companion at King's College in the 1930s, Prof. Edward J. Dent-that the right way to listen to music was by attending to "the actual musical sounds" alone. Certainly there has long been a climate of disapproval around nonmusical associations with music. We are urged not to think of "pictures" while listening to music; we are relieved when Beet- hoven, Berlioz, and Mahler back away from the seemingly forthright programs they have attached to their symphonies. The copious philosophizing occasioned by this phenomenon has mostly tried to explain it away. I believe, on the contrary, that such associations are the essential interpretative moves that we make in music criticism. We make them, of course, in covert as well as overt ways. I will try to demonstrate this general proposition-I will not try to argue it-in the following reading of Beethoven's G-Major Concerto. Notice that the one place where the reading breaks down will be the one place where I am at a loss to make such an association. As for the philosophizing, that has to begin with the banal observation that such associations are very widely made by music lovers or "competent listeners" within the culture. Rough is forte and staccato, unharmonized octaves, jumpy melodic lines, and odd, jagged rhythms. Plaintive is molto cantabile, smooth har- mony, songlike melody with appoggiaturas, and an even, unobtrusive rhythmic flux (example 1).3 The axiomatic nature of such representation is the premise behind Leonard Ratner's theory of "topics" or topoi in classical music, as well as the lexicon in Deryck Cooke's once popular "language of music." And Ratner and Cooke are open to criticism not because they are wrong about this, but because they do not deal adequately (or at all) with the association of music with extra- musical categories on other levels, beyond the primal. II "The orchestra rough, the piano plaintive, the orchestra gradually calmer": what is primal about Beethoven's Andante is notjust that he is deploying Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 81</page><page sequence="3">conventional topoi but also that he forces the contrast between rough and plaintive by using altogether distinct musical materials. This is a sharply contrasted dia- logue. So far, so very easy. It is a little less easy to account for the gradual "calming," even though this may seem intuitively just as clear as the roughness and the plaintiveness; a process or an action is more than the sum of certain qualities exposed over time. At issue is the relationship between solo and orchestra, in particular their changing rela- tionship, and this we cannot grasp by an appeal to musical pith. The appeal must be made to musical syntax, to the way notes and groups of notes, harmonies, and rhythms follow one another and "make sense." A moment ago I called the primal effects in this movement "gestural in an almost premusical way"; it would be better to say "in a presyntactical way." It is true that the orchestra gets quieter and quieter, the solo higher and higher, and that these are means which anyone would count as primal (ex. 2). But an additional and more refined contribution to the total effect is provided by the musical syntax, of which one important aspect is harmonic. The process takes place over four clearly distinct stages, each begun by the strings and continued by the piano, and Edward T. Cone has pointed out that each stage is similar in its harmonic structure.4 Each time the strings attempt to move away from the tonic key or at least the tonic triad, and each time the piano guides the music back to where it started (ibid.). When the last, quietest orchestral statement resolves in and accepts the tonic, the calming process is complete. Music can represent nonmusical feelings, ideas, and action on the syntactical level, then, as well as on the primal level. The above account of the calming action attributes human action-qualities to the strings and the piano: they are seen as agents who attempt, guide, accept, succeed, and enjoy or suffer a relationship. The modulatory urge of the strings counts as another of their rough attributes, no doubt-a syntactical attribute, this time, rather than a primal one. The piano's refusal to let them do so, on the other hand, would seem to be better characterized by words like entropic or tenacious rather than plaintive. Thus if there is an orphic analogy to be drawn with the musical action, it would have to be a steadfast singer causing wild beasts to become tranquil, rather than a suasive one causing obsti- nate Furies to become flexible. Syntactical associations can probably not be said to be axiomatic in the sense that every music lover makes them. (Notice that according to me, Forster got the orphic parallel slightly wrong; when you are not quite at home in a language, you may gather that a murder has taken place without being sure who it was who killed whom. Still, Forster got lively satisfaction from the music just by grasping the big picture-calming, a murder-without needing or really wanting to com- prehend the details. A concerto is not a detective story.) However, associations on the syntactical level are habitual within another interpretative community, the 82 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="4">professional community of critics, music theorists, and musicologists. Donald Tovey, for example, never hesitated to draw on literary parallels, images, ideas, and jokes for his explications of musical compositions. Harmonic effects, in par- ticular, brought out his most unbuttoned displays of emotive or anthropomorphic language. And Fred Everett Maus has recently stressed that even musical analysts with a reputation for formalism, such as Arnold Schoenberg and Heinrich Schenker, use language of this sort.5 The use of such language and the tacit acknowledgment of its importance is also becoming more and more common in recent academic music criticism. As we shall see, a specific Orpheus program gets harder and harder to main- tain as the rest of the Beethoven's slow movement unfolds, but I do not think there is anything "capricious" about a generalized orphic interpretation of the music. It is not necessary to invoke the evidence, most of it circumstantial, showing that Beethoven himself had Orpheus in mind when he composed this music;6 there is no need for the philosophically charged appeal to intentionality. Like Orpheus, the individual who is the piano in Beethoven's op. 58 overcomes a hostile community and then (as we shall see) experiences some kind of failure; hence the interpretative tradition that has grown up in a culture that knows them both. The fact that Forster could dream up Orpheus for himself in this connec- tion, years after it had first made an appearance in a book by A. B. Marx in 1830, tells us something. III The sharply contrasted dialogue that Beethoven sets up at the begin- ning of the Andante con moto of the G-Major Concerto seems archetypical of concerto relationships. In fact, it is quite unusual. In the standard (classical- romantic) concerto repertory, most of the dialogues, encounters, exchanges, or confrontations between the solo instrument and the orchestra deploy the same musical material, not utterly different material, as here. It is hard to think of many moments in the canonic concerto repertory that are as stark as Beethoven in this regard.7 Using the same rather than different musical material complicates and enriches a relationship: the second element somehow refers to the first, as does not happen in the Andante. The second may act as a varied repetition of the first, a sort of echo, a response, a rebuttal, a correction, a completion, or some combi- nation of these things. One must attend to individual cases. An instructive passage to examine is the very beginning of the first movement of the same G-Major Concerto, encompassing the initial encounter of the two concerto agents. A quiet phrase is played by the piano alone, followed by a longer quiet phrase Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 83</page><page sequence="5">played by the orchestral strings, also alone, using the identical musical material (ex. 3). (To be precise, the piano statement includes three distinct melodic cellules which all recur in the string answer.) As the piano phrase is syntactically (har- monically) "open" and the string phrase "closed," they can be categorized as an antecedent-consequent pair: a technical term of little hermeneutic power since such patterns are ubiquitous and infinitely various in the classical-romantic rep- ertory. A consequent is said to "answer" an antecedent. What kind of an answer? In this case, one which, because of its new instrumental color and its greater extension, melodic span, harmonic range, and cadential weight, makes the quiet statement seem naive. Except for instrumental color, all of the above-mentioned criteria are not primal but syntactical: the key term, greater, arises from the relationship. Hence our sense of the relationship established in these phrases can be refined by the musical equivalent of explication de texte, along the following lines perhaps. At first, the piano statement dwells rather simply on and around a single note (it is B), and then begins to grow melodically more expansive. But this little spurt of growth is cut short, so that the piano ends prematurely, its rhythm in disarray, as though it has suddenly become unsure of itself. Then during the evocative rest- no more than a catch in the voice-at the end of its statement, the piano seems to invite guidance. The entry of the strings, in consequence, is calm, assured, and beautifully measured-as though they have been considering: a lesson rather than a retort (ibid.). Where the piano's rhythm faltered, the strings take a slow, deep breath which sustains them to their conclusion. The string phrase corrects the piano phrase while enriching it. Put another way, the strings' consequent phrase does not so much complete, expand, or even answer the piano antecedent as reinter- pret it-starting with the harmonic reinterpretation of the note B. The luminous new chord (under and upon B) with which the strings enter is usually singled out as the most distinctive feature of the passage; it is hard to argue with that, except by saying that no one feature should be singled out from the passage as a whole. The luminosity derives as much from textural as harmonic factors; as well as breaking out of the prevailing diatonic harmony, making a cross-relation with the previous chord, asserting a third-relationship-as well as performing all these harmonic functions, the chord is played by a new sound body. (Also-do we hear this?-the chord is a little throatily scored, with the violas above the second violins. The double basses are silent.) The relationship between the dialoguists does not feel conflicted. On the con- trary, they remain in a state of perfect sympathy. Yet the strings are clearly freer in their phrase, more at home; perhaps even more important than the compar- ative features mentioned above, the material itself when the strings play it feels more genuinely idiomatic. Their confidence contrasts with the tentativeness of 84 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="6">the piano. It is no wonder that after this lesson the piano falls silent, and that it is still sounding subdued when it next appears, some seventy bars and a couple of eventful minutes later (ex. 4). A Parenthesis The attribution of feelings, motives, and so on to the concerto agents has snowballed in the above explication; in theory, at least, these attributions are sustained by specific aspects of the musical gestures and phrases that the critic can point to and describe technically. The very last sentence of the discussion, though, moves into new conceptual territory. When the piano returns after sev- enty bars of orchestral music, its rhythm, melody, and dynamics are such that a word like weak could be fairly attached to it, on the basis of what has been said so far. But why and by whom is the piano "subdued"? And what is the force of still? These are rather complicated "associations"-one relational, the other tem- poral-that would not arise after hearing the piano reentry alone, or the piano reentry only in relation to the immediately preceding orchestral music. The lis- tener remembers the earlier relationship, at the beginning of the movement, and the combination of events that made the piano seem weak two and a half minutes earlier. That was, we reflect, rather a long time ago. We attribute yet another human quality to the piano, memory. The level of representation on which the musical effect operates is not the gesture, not the phrase or period, but the larger reaches of musical form. I shall call this the level of reflection. By definition, this must be the ultimate level of aesthetic response to works like the Beethoven con- certo in its totality; and it must also be obvious that as compared to the primal and syntactical levels, response on the reflective level is more subtle and problem- atic. Two problems in particular will occupy us, contextualization in the first of these parentheses, and linearity in the second. Reflection as defined here is not of course always innocent; listeners some- times know what to expect. They know, in particular, what to expect of instru- mental compositions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, whose musical form was accommodated to standard plans, called "musical forms" or even, some- times, "plots" on the analogy of narrative theory. "A work (in creation and per- ception) will resonate from and with its genre and established patterns of musical composition," or it may "unfold in a transgression of the convention or a trans- formation of the model," writes Carolyn Abbate, in the course of a strenuous demonstration that this does not validate the analogy with narrative.8 Of this, more later. No doubt prior contextual knowledge is more important for appre- hending musical form, on the reflective level, than musical syntax and gesture. Anyone who is surprised by the "Surprise" Symphony can grasp the rough and Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 85</page><page sequence="7">the plaintive of Beethoven's slow movement, and anyone who appreciates "Happy birthday to you" can also appreciate the initial encounter of the first movement; more learning is required to appreciate the piano reentry that started the present discussion. What listeners will have learned from the classical concerto repertory in gen- eral is that a concerto consists of three movements, and that the first of them is inevitably in what Charles Rosen calls "concerto sonata form."9 The piece begins with a ritornello-a long orchestral statement of the main discursive materials that will be dealt with, ultimately, by both the orchestra and the solo. The solo instrument waits in the wings until (or almost until) the ritornello has achieved strong closure before making its entrance. Then in a new section the solo and the orchestra present or discuss the material again, but with significant changes: the solo, for example, asserts its individuality by modulating to a "bright" new key (as Tovey, whose insight this was, would have said). It is this new section, the exposi- tion, of the G-Major Concerto that is initiated by the piano reentry. For future reference, the rest of concerto sonata form consists of a development section and a recapitulation, both of which engage both the solo and the orchestra; a solo cadenza; and a short conclusion or coda. Things are more than a little different in Beethoven's G-Major Concerto. This is because for the first time in the consequential history of the genre, Beethoven brought the solo in at the very beginning of the first movement. It was probably a foregone conclusion that he would make this move sooner or later, if only to display the soloist more effectively. This accorded both with his own self-image- he himself, of course, was the soloist in his piano concertos-and with the emphatic new style that he was developing in the years after 1800. A concerto is an engagement between solo and orchestra, and a soloist bred up on the Waldstein Sonata could hardly be expected to stand tamely by while an orchestra dilates at some length in the style of the Eroica Symphony. Bringing the soloist in at the beginning of the first movement led Beethoven to a new construal of concerto relationships. The plan was this. After the solo opens the concerto by quietly starting a theme, the orchestra, without fuss and almost without effort, answers the solo in such a way as to make its quiet seem naive. The solo's subsequent waiting in the wings during the ritornello is there- fore rationalized; the solo has motivated the opening orchestral argument but cannot, or will not, participate in it further. What is more, the ritornello is charged because we are anticipating not the entrance of an unknown solo but, more viv- idly, the return of a known one. This anticipation is increased, perhaps, by Beet- hoven's use of as many as three distinct cadential themes at the end of the ritornello, that is, short themes which seem designed to close themselves off and write finis to the whole section. When closure finally occurs and the solo reenters to commence the solo-orchestra exposition, it is simply more palpable than usual 86 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="8">at this point in a traditional concerto-for it has already been heard. Also, it has earned a certain pathos from its unequal exchange with the band. If this is a case of "transgression of the convention" or a "transformation of the model," it is a case of a special kind: a rethinking of the genre to make it less conventional, more primal. IV Certainly the solo in Beethoven's Allegro moderato recovers from its initial setback. Witness its bold introduction, subsequently, of new themes in very remote keys-B-flat major and C-sharp minor, both of which unquestionably sound remote-its imperturbable and very beautiful decorative commentary on both of the orchestra's main themes, and its forceful preemption of the recapit- ulation. Yet this is a concerto movement unusually low on virtuoso writing, and our final memory of it is likely to be of its mild, retiring lyricism. One small detail may perhaps be taken as emblematic. In an unassertive coda at the end of the movement, where the solo takes over two of the ritornello's cadential themes, it also takes over a disruptive bass E flat associated with them that has delayed cad- ential action several times earlier in the movement, always with a sforzato (ex. 5). The solo now smooths this over into a pianissimo (ex. 6). ' To return to the exposition: the entire ending of this section is unusually quiet, as far as the solo is concerned." There is no special passage devoted to virtuosity, such as Beethoven inserted into all his other concertos at this point in the form. Instead, the piano has to make do with playing florid accompaniments to the first of the ritornello's cadential themes, an energetic item originally played by the full orchestra, now played by the winds (ex. 7). This circular effect is turned to the solo's disadvantage. In the ritornello there were three cadential themes, as has already been mentioned; when the piano settles into a long trill after just one of them (the first), the cadential section seems to have been cut drastically-and with it goes the usual opportunity for virtuoso display. Beethoven has something else in mind. Rather than resolve the trill and let the orchestra take over, which is what the concerto "plot" prescribes for such trills, he has the piano play the same theme again, not energetically but in its own char- acteristic way, dolce e con espressione. This tender episode-altogether unexpected at this point in a concerto-is beginning to get louder when it is cut off abruptly by the full orchestra (ex. 8). One is tempted to say that it is dismissed as a sen- timental irrelevancy; which is harsher treatment than the piano has received at any point up to now, or will receive later. This is, of course, another reflective response. Only because we have heard the theme before, played by a single agent all the way through, does its division now between two agents strike us as fraught Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 87</page><page sequence="9">with tension. Even after modulating to a new key, the soloist has been denied closure there. V Since my reading of the first movement of the G-Major Concerto stresses the vexed, often subordinate position of the piano in its changing rela- tionship with the orchestra, I must not seem to gloss over the development section and the beginning of the recapitulation, where the piano positively thrives. The difficulty is that I cannot read the beginning of the recapitulation. In brief: the solo picks up very notably during these portions of the concerto. At the beginning of the development section, it converts its tentative entry into an eloquent new theme with rich modulatory energy; it rides the orchestral wave that develops out of this theme; and it breaks free of the orchestra in the most brilliant passage in the entire movement-fifteen bars of tense bravura preparing a remote new key and yet another new solo theme. What the bravura prepares is not so much a theme as a somnolent searching for a theme: a moment of high mystery, the one uncanny place in the whole concerto (ex. 9). Then there is a remarkable sense of relaxation, in a retransition passage inspired by a light-hearted sense of play that will also mark the concerto's finale.'2 Solo and orchestra are suddenly involved in repartee, as the various wind instru- ments race to wrench the key around the tonic. Piano and orchestra in collusion develop a fantastical little fugato, a whimsical Mendelssohn scherzo avant la lettre. Also whimsical is the hasty crescendo and the horn call that announces the reca- pitulation with unanticipated pomp (ex. 10). The new character is unexplained, except, perhaps, as a radical vision of new possibilities of relationship. For even the agency seems to have fragmented or diffused. During this episode one has less the impression of piano-orchestra duality than of a single new agent-a new ad hoc orchestra including a piano, such as Stravinsky uses in the Symphony in Three Movements and Bartok in the Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta. It would not be hard, in fact, to envisage this episode located somewhere else in the movement. There is no overriding reason for it to be situated just where it is. Its unique charisma does not emerge from the developmental process that precedes it, and does not lead consequentially to the very forceful recapitulation that follows. On the level of reflection, the beginning of the recapitulation is the climactic moment in the first movement of the G-Major Concerto, as in so many other works by this composer. My difficulty is that almost alone among such moments in Beethoven, this one leaves me bewildered. What is being represented here? Of course it is clear that the opening theme is completely transformed in mood-the 88 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="10">piano's quiet antecedent phrase now beginning fortissimo, with a sharp rhythmic jar, and ending with extravagant ornamentation. But as the dynamic fades, con- tinuous piano figuration or filigree appears high above the string's consequent phrase, so that the all-important sense of solo-orchestra exchange is lost (ex. 1 1). It is also clear that the buoyant new mood of this recapitulation has been carefully prepared by the previous passage of dissociated, spirited play (notice how the all- important note B is anticipated by the horn call, both as to pitch and to rhythm); but that is not to say that it has been rationalized. I don't come up with any asso- ciation to "explain" it. The mood fades as rapidly as it materialized, and seems to have no reflection or influence later in the musical argument. This amounts to saying that it lacks continuity with or reinforcement in the coda (for it is just not Beethoven's way to use the later stages of the recapitulation for action of this kind). Indeed, the coda positively deepens the passive mood of the end of the exposition, which as always has been recalled circularly at the end of the recapitulation. Once again a piano trill is not resolved-this trill is the traditional signal for the end of the cadenza-and once again the piano plays its favorite cadential theme, in a newly nostalgic version. For the dynamics are now p dolce-poco cresc.-pp, and this time the piano is not cut off by the orchestra (ex. 6). (The pp smooths out the disruptive E flat mentioned above.) And at this late date the piano provides a new touch of espressivo by playing a theme it has never played before: the last of the ritornello's cadential themes. The orchestral strings play this theme an octave below the piano, acknowledging the appropriation-a relational effect of Mozartian delicacy (ex. 12). The insistent mildness of this coda is not dispelled by the hasty four-bar crescendo at its conclusion, which has more the feeling of a formal echo of the ending of the development than of a gesture in its own right. Since the last theme played by the solo (the theme it had never played before) is a derivative of the first theme, the solo does end up engaged with the move- ment's main subject matter. Just before this, of course, it has played a cadenza, the traditional demonstration of the soloist's virtu' while the orchestra waits silently for a comeback-a comeback that Beethoven here denies it. For in the coda the orchestra backs away, evaporates; that is why the piano can be as gentle as it is. It is probably the case, in fact, that the orchestra has as many irresolute and unas- sertive moments in this movement as the piano does, when the development, recapitulation, and coda are all taken into account. It would be a mistake to appre- hend this concerto relationship as one of domination and submission. Though the piano may often present itself as vulnerable, the orchestra usually declines to press its advantage. All of this could perhaps have been predicted from the concerto's haunting initial encounter. At the end of the movement, in any case, the uneasy relation- ship of the opening has not been resolved. Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 89</page><page sequence="11">VI It is resolved at the end of the Andante con moto. The piece may be short, but I can't agree with Rosen that "much of the poetry of this slow movement derives from its incomplete nature: it defines and establishes, not itself, but some- thing to come."' 3 After the initial "calming" process which was discussed earlier- we can call it the orphic agon-the drama receives its completion in two further phases whose function is clarified, once again, by classical models. A striking written-out cadenza provides a peripeteia. A final phrase has all the weight of a classical exodos, and with it the resolution of musical action over two movements. The first movement surprised by beginning so quietly; the second movement shocks by beginning so angrily. The return of the same agents in dialogue-piano and string orchestra-clearly marks a return to unfinished business broached at the beginning of the Allegro moderato. Reflective memories of the earlier rela- tionship are perhaps stirred by the piano's first chord, of the luminous first string chord in the Allegro, and other details; but things have deteriorated badly. The strings are now harsh, practically grotesque, and the piano dangerously cool (it is marked una corda-left pedal-almost throughout). The uneasy face-off of the Allegro is replayed in the Andante as a confrontation. Cone's analysis of the harmonic process in this movement can be amplified by analysis of register (height or lowness). All four stages of the agon are initiated by the strings from the same rather low note (E above middle C, supported by lower octaves; ex. 2); in general, the strings occupy lower ground than the piano, and the gap between the registers increases until at the climax of the fourth stage the piano soars up to its highest reach in the whole piece, high G above the staff, to begin a peroration of incomparable eloquence and grace. But although the piano has prevailed over the strings, it now seems to experience difficulty in making its final cadence-that is, in finding its way down to the strings' low E, two and a half octaves below. It swoops down too fast, perhaps, hitting some obstacle that drives it up again as though on a rebound, its harmonies turned anxious and chromatic (ex. 13). The piano is experiencing a sudden crisis. In an extraordinary terse cadenza, attended silently by the strings, crude thrusts at D sharp are disrupted by the blur of D natural and C in a fortissimo trill a tre corde, and by a harsh nonechoing figure G sharp-A above (ex. 14). (It is possible to interpret the pitch configuration here as a flashback to the first dissonant sounds in the Allegro moderato, but surely this must be a primal effect, not a syntactical or a reflective one.) The agon was a process; this cadenza is an aporia, its violence unexplained and completely unex- pected, even given the omens of the preceding chromatic passage. Rosen speaks of "a brief cadenza of the utmost despair."'4 The feeling represented is perhaps closer to desperation, frustration, loss of control, breakdown. One waits to see how this excessive emotion will be discharged. How, in tech- 90 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="12">nical terms, can Beethoven resolve the immoderate dissonance-using the term broadly, to include textural and rhythmic tensions as well as harmonic ones-that the cadenza has injected into the movement? The piano does not accomplish the resolution alone; that seems to me to be the important point. There has been too much furious energy in the trills and the dissonant thrusting action to be disposed of by Beethoven's gesture at the end of the cadenza-two very thick, quiet piano chords proceeding to a hollow double octave E (ex. 15). In itself, this resolution would not suffice. It is made solid, and given special expressive force, by the reentry of the strings at exactly this point on their original pitch, low E. They are marked ppp, to be sure-a rare indication for Beethoven-and they add no new pitches to the piano's double octave. But what they do add, their sonority, or texture, is like a sustained territorial memory. This exodos is a reconciliation, a reestablishment of community. Once they have reasserted themselves, however weakly, the strings are able to reach a new state of equilibrium with the now weakened piano. A new syntactical basis for the relationship emerges in these last bars-a new motif uttered just once by the strings and the piano; the strings reflectively absorb the appoggiatura character- istic of the piano material, while the piano adopts the repeated notes character- istic of the strings, each for the first time.'5 No longer hostile, the antagonists reach a muted mutual goal together. If we are ready to think of them confronting one another earlier in the piece, we can also conceive of them comforting one another at the end. Forster spoke of "true love" at the conclusion of this move- ment: a true insight (ex. 16). A Second Parenthesis Starting with primal qualities, roughness and plaintiveness, we moved on to the expressive syntax of the opening calming agon and ended up with a complete minidrama-speaking loosely, a narrative. Theorizing about narrativity in music and narrative interpretations have occupied a number of music critics recently, among them, I think it is fair to say, some of the most interesting.'6 Many would call Carolyn Abbate the front runner in this field, and yet it is also she who is throwing the most distracting apples. She makes us all pause for a moment. Her remarkable recent book Unsung Voices deals primarily with opera, espe- cially Wagnerian opera, where real, robust, nonmetaphorical narratives occur and hold up the dramatic action. Abbate makes the powerful point (new, perhaps, to some musical narratologists) that the essence of narrative resides not in plots but in the distancing effect of the narrator and in the performance situation. One of her projects, furthermore, is to work back from opera to the field of instru- mental music and apply there her particular intuition into the unacknowledged (unsung) voice of narrative-a displacement, a disruption, an intrusion of the Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 91</page><page sequence="13">phenomenal into the noumenal world. It seems that an elaborate and insistent polemic against "programmatic" interpretation was necessary to clear space for the latter project.'7 An ironic writer, Abbate points out that structuralist narrative theories of instrumental music turn up in music criticism at just the time when our other structuralist methodologies are in full retreat. She is bemused by the "nostalgic" reappearance of nineteenth-century programmatic interpretations in what she calls "softened incarnations." Like most everyone else, she deplores Mickey Mouse, "isomorphous" linkages between drum beats and sixteenth notes and event sequences in some story; narrative readings trivialize music when they treat it as merely mimetic, as "miming without distance." What gives pause is her rejection of dramatistic readings when they do not offer themselves as narrative. Mimesis, which by definition lacks the temporal distance of diegesis, need not however lack what Abbate calls its moral distance; mimesis is not always "mere" mimesis, in music any more than in drama. A good demonstration of this, one might think, is Wagner's treatment of leitmotifs, as analyzed by various critics, but for Abbate the leitmotif (or, rather, leitmotivic interpretation of Wagner) is a major obstacle that had to be cleared out of that space. She seems to end up registering a global aversion to representational analysis whether it presents itself as narrative (Cone, Owen Jander, Stephen Hefling), quasi-narrative (Anthony Newcomb, Leo Treitler), or dramatistic (passim). Thus as an example of a traditional "narrative" reading, which would be more correctly called a "mimetic" reading, Abbate cites Berlioz on the Funeral March of the Eroica Symphony (and Forster on the concerto Andante would have served her purpose just as well). "La marche funebre est tout un drame," Berlioz remarks; at the end of this drama the march theme returns in "fragments broken by silences ... and when these shreds of that sorrowful melody have fallen, one by one, back to the tonic note, alone, naked, broken, and effaced, the wind instru- ments cry out: the warriors' final farewell to their companion in arms." Berlioz also evokes the convoy for Pallas in the Eneid, and for Abbate that is evidently reason to assume that in his mind the music was "isomorphous" with that specific funeral tableau. I am not able to follow this argument-actually, there is no argu- ment-nor can I follow Abbate in taking Berlioz's one direct analogy between music and imagined event (the warriors' outcry in the final wind chords) as a confirmation of isomorphism. It can just as easily be taken as a one-time-only exception. And one cannot believe that Berlioz, however laconic his comment, believed that Beethoven was merely tracking the imagined event rather than dis- tancing it, entering into it imaginatively.'8 In the Beethoven concerto, as I read it, specific events in an Orpheus story are indeed eschewed. This music represents a developing relationship-a "rela- 92 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="14">tionship story" that has a shape of its own, but which can and should also be followed throughout the other movements as well. I see no reason to jettison Orpheus, any more than Pallas, but if he stays on board he stays with the under- standing that none of the tales he tells after Ovid or Virgil, Monteverdi or Gluck, is isomorphous with the relationship story. The issue is forced because, in the unusual case of this concerto slow move- ment, the music, while not isomorphic with anything, reads unproblematically in a direct, linear fashion. This is not the case with most music by Beethoven, and Abbate rightly zeroes in on the most obvious problem in relating music in time with drama or narrative-the presence of large-scale repetitions and recapitula- tions.'9 How can a biographical interpretation of a symphony, say, deal with the repetition of the exposition-is this a slice of the hero's life replayed? Long stretches of Paul Dukas's L'Apprenti sorcier, Abbate remarks sourly in the course of her virtuoso reading of this piece, "simply motor along" without intimations of bisected brooms or floods or incantations. Cone once suggested formal repeti- tions are "often best interpreted as representations of events rehearsed in memory" (not as often, though, as we might like).20 Hermann Danuser's attempts to draw on the story/discourse dualism of narrative theory-Danuser treats recapitulative sections in Mahler symphonies as "epic syntheses"-are among the few initiatives in recent criticism that seem to gain Abbate's qualified approval. The question of linearity comes up as soon as we start thinking "reflectively" about music. In the case of concerto sonata form, one can say that generally speaking the ritornello will be experienced linearly, and so will the development section. The first time the discourse will seem to double back on itself is in the exposition, when the piano and orchestra go through much, all, or most of the matter already presented by the ritornello. Karol Berger, interpreting concerto sonata form in Mozart and early Beethoven, has ingeniously posited a narrative genre in which the same story is told three times in three different versions by means of two narrative voices. First, in the opening ritornello (that is, the first main period), the orchestra tells the story as it knows it. Then, in the first solo [i.e., the exposition] . .. the soloist tells his version. Finally, [in the recapitulation] . . . both narrators reconcile and synthesize their two versions, with the orchestra beginning and the soloist taking over, to produce the final, full telling of what happened.2' (For told read enacted throughout.) But Berger's apportionments seem too neat; in the exposition, is the solo really operating on its own, or conferring with the orchestra, and is the new version of the story really "his version" or a consensus product? The latter, to judge from the completely fresh exposition theme con- tributed by the orchestra in the present concerto, as in some others by Beethoven and Mozart (and Brahms). There are similar difficulties with the recapitulation. Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 93</page><page sequence="15">The matter of linearity in sonata-type music remains problematic in the extreme. The reader will not have missed the studied vagueness about linearity in the above account of the Allegro moderato of op. 58. VII The slow movement of op. 58 has a story but no standard "form" or plot, no conventional schema of repetitions, modulations, recapitulations, and the like, which are more or less prescribed from work to work (as in the concerto sonata form of the first movement). The finale of the concerto has a plot but no story, I think, even though it includes actions that are well defined. Rather, the finale represents a steady state of relationship, which I can best characterize briefly as a state of communal free play. It is true that the state is not entirely steady-that the feeling of play deepens as the music proceeds, especially with the burgeoning of the form toward the end of the movement. Except in this very general way, however, the music is not experienced as a linear progression. The plot is well known, and Beethoven names it: "Rondo. Vivace," a scheme to bring a vivacious-playful-tune back over and over again, with or without variations. (Nobody dares improvise rondo variations today, but luckily in this concerto Beethoven wrote them out in the score.) Unlike the slow movement, then, but like the vast majority of pieces in this repertory, the finale has many large-scale repetitions which do not admit linear reading. A rondo is in fact the paradigmatic case of a musical form with circular repetitions or recapitulations breaking the story line, and in this rondo the theme appears no fewer than six times. Formal repetitions, says Cone, "are often best interpreted as representa- tions of events rehearsed in memory," and this certainly fits the case of the third rondo return here, with its nostalgic clarinet skeletonizing the theme as a back- drop for the piano's newly invigorated reduction of its surface (ex. 17). Concerto rondos have their own particular turn of plot, not present in other rondos: the alternation of solo and orchestra in playing the basic rondo theme or, more often, its constituent members. The classroom representation of Beet- hoven's rondo theme is a (orchestra) a' (written-out piano variation) b (orchestra) b (piano). These are formal repeats, with no syntactic force; there is no sense here of the piano responding to the orchestra-as the strings answer the piano at the beginning of the first movement. There is, in fact, no sense of relationship between the two agents, simply of their coexistence and joint participation in a single musical action (ex. 18). So far, so traditional. Untraditional-in fact quite astonishing-is a little flurry of piano-orchestra repartee that emerges after the theme's second element, b (or "countertheme," as Tovey called it).22 The minuscule fragment from the end of b, with its acceler- ating echoes, is playful in the same primal, axiomatic sense that the string and 94 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="16">piano phrases in the slow movement are rough and plaintive (ex. 19). Things happen so fast that we are hardly aware of the glimmer of relationship that has been introduced. This sinks in after a second, more dramatic reversal of expec- tations a few moments later. I may seem to be making a great deal out of less than three seconds of music; but besides disrupting the plot, the repartee fragment is beautifully calculated by its rhythm and harmony to set in relief the next order of prescribed business, which is a forceful orchestral presentation of the rondo theme. (It is particularly forceful in this concerto, since trumpets and drums enter here for the first time- a spectacular effect.)23 The concerto-rondo plot prescribes solid closure at the end of such orchestral presentations, with a tonic cadence, either at the end of the theme or phrase (as in Beethoven's Piano Concerto no. 1, for example) or after an extension (as in his Violin Concerto). What had never happened before in a concerto, I believe, was for the solo instrument to interrupt this forceful orchestra statement in full cry (ex. 20). Taking these two reversals together-and we are still only about forty seconds into the movement-we have the impression of an exceptionally feisty relation- ship between solo and orchestra. The cutting off of the newly enlarged orchestra seems an act of special impudence, until the orchestra cuts the piano off just as abruptly, and this back-and-forth continues, the interruptions growing closer and closer until they merge in feeling with the earlier repartee. The total effect is of tussle. Like the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip, this music embraces sprightly action only in order to articulate a steady state, a state of communal play. There is no story. Sometimes the piano comes out on top, sometimes the orchestra. The tussle just mentioned ends with the piano in the ascendancy, preparing a new, self- repeating theme which it then abandons impatiently, whereupon the orchestra urbanely gives a completed counterstatement in rich polyphony-the richest sound-texture in the whole concerto, in the manner of the Pastoral Symphony, making the piano sound very naive: and not for the first time. Unembarrassed, the piano breaks in again with flashy arpeggios (ex. 21). .. and so the movement goes. It does not matter, perhaps, if some of the gestures-indeed, some extended trains of gestures-have been heard before. It would indeed matter, though, if the repetitions began to sound redundant. The formal must not regress into the merely formal, and this the composer guarded against by a remarkable expansion of horizons that gets under way when more than half of the music is still to come. Tovey, who rightly called Beethoven's rondo an "audacious masterpiece of gigantic and inexhaustibly varied propor- tions," and who wrote about this so well,24 did not pinpoint a virtually extempo- raneous quality to the composition itself, to the sequence of events that enabled the expansion in dimensions and mood. There is a paradoxical but palpable illu- sion of musical form being improvised-though just who is doing the improvi- Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 95</page><page sequence="17">sation, whether the solo, the orchestra, or a master-mind composer, is impossible to say. The new mood has only been hinted at earlier-a mood of inspired comedy, intellectual delight in musical manipulations, and above all a celebration of spon- taneous play. Some of its more playful features tread a fine line between the irre- pressible and the irresponsible. Orchestral developments of the main theme's (a) three-note cadence figure (ex. 22), unexpected at this late date, grow unexpect- edly boisterous (ex. 23). The second theme appears for the last time as a kind of phantasmagorical-comical collage, with a new childlike accompaniment for the piano and in an utterly implausible key. When this key corrects itself, a fragment of the first theme intervenes bizarrely to readmit the second theme played by the orchestra (ex. 24). After the cadenza-"La cadenza sia corte," wrote Beethoven on the score; with his improvisational energies channeled into the form, he wanted no competition from the soloist-sheer foolery takes over as the piano next begins a wistful little scale study (ex. 25). The whole last part of the finale abounds in various whimsicalities, based especially on the three-note cadence figure. VIII Finally, on the matter of the global relationship-story traced by the concerto as a whole, I have only one or two simple and, probably, obvious things to add to what has been said above. My sense of the concerto as a whole emerges from my impression of the initial encounter in the first movement, and from the conviction that the relational dissonance remains unresolved within that move- ment itself. The action has been complex, vivid, fascinating, and indeterminate, leaving the antagonists not so much at loggerheads as at cross purposes, seriously engaged and yet-save for a brief (and prophetic?) moment in the retransition- always wary of one another. In the next movement, the uncertainty in the original relationship comes out into the open; conflict is acted out in stages that register acknowledgment, suffering, and reconciliation. The peripeteia in the violent piano cadenza now represents a crisis central to the whole relationship to date, not just to the episode represented by the second movement. The reconciliation at the end resolves not just the quasi-orphic drama of the Andante con moto but the entire train of events initiated by the initial encounter of the Allegro modera- to. The sympathy expressed in that encounter is now matched for the first time, in the muted intimacy at the very end of the Andante. The finale answers to this with its representation of communal spontaneous play. The story has been told, and what remains is to define the new state of relationship that has emerged from it. For the first time the agents are completely at ease with one another. A rondo is a pretty straightforward thing-very easy, 96 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="18">Forster might say; it is hard to think of a serious composer who has not tried to "play off" this plot at one time or another, in Anthony Newcomb's phrase. Schu- mann as critic repeatedly put down the rondo, and as composer sandbagged it in his Second Symphony and his A-Major Quartet.25 Beethoven took a different tack in the G-Major Concerto: he discovered a use for what Schumann disapprovingly called the "lustige Rondoweise" without complication or defamiliarization. Many concertos, symphonies, and so on resolve their initial tensions by the end of the first movement, and many treat the slow movement as some kind of utopian digression. By delaying resolution of the initial conflict to the very end of a con- tinuously conflicted second movement, Beethoven found a way to rationalize and thus revivify the whole idea of the rondo finale. Play provides an apt dramatic release after the pent-up tensions of the earlier movements. What is psychologically so just is that the release does not happen quite at once. The slow movement merges into the finale without pause; and right after the famous concluding slow sigh of the piano, what we hear are the strings drum- ming obscurely on a single, slightly odd chord. Dimly and imprecisely, this ges- ture mirrors syntactically and-dare we reflect?-resolves the encounter at the very beginning of the concerto. The chord itself has to normalize itself, by resolving to the tonic. Experienced repeatedly when the rondo theme recurs, this miniature action encapsulates the total drama (ex. 26). Let me conclude with a few words on (and a word for) another critic who is doing interesting work with narrative in music, Fred Maus. The starting point for Maus was the insight that the human associations people make with music are mostly with actions, rather than with emotions, as is usually said; so naturally his explanatory model for music is drama, not narrative. Like Abbate, he recoils from straightforward programmatic readings: musical representations of a program can have a "banal concreteness" if the program plods along in "real time," and less banal narratives in music can often not be construed exactly. Indeed, for Maus indeterminacy of plot is one of music's attractive features; the agency that selects from the "story" to create the "discourse" in music, he remarks, is as imper- sonal as the camera in film. Agency, indeed, is a special problem for Maus. His view of music as drama depends on action and agents, but whether the agent is the orchestra or an oboe in the orchestra, or a motif, or even a tonality can very often not be determined. To Maus, this indeterminacy of agency is another of music's attractions. That may be; but then one wonders what to make of works-genres-in which agency is entirely or almost entirely clear. Of course, the genre I am thinking of is the concerto. While plenty of exceptions exist, which are fascinating and instructive, in general one knows exactly who is who in a concerto and who is doing what. There is a soloist and an orchestra, and there is usually quite a sharp sense of character, of "the powerful and multicolored orchestra and its weak but high-spirited adversary," as Tchaikovsky once put it. The characters or Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 97</page><page sequence="19">agents exist in some kind of a relationship (an adversarial relationship, some- times, though less often than is thought), and what is traced in a concerto is the course of a relationship. Narrative theory has proved to be a stimulus to musical hermeneutics in recent years, and Abbate's sharp critique can only lead to further stimulus. A soft spot that needs more investigation and experiment is the problem of temporal linearity. The suggestion here is that we can do all this in certain ways more easily dealing with concertos, where there is less to worry about as regards the other problem remarked by Maus, that of agency, and then move on to more complex works in which classical music enjoys the full flood of its indeterminacy.

The evidence is all indirect; Beethoven wrote nothing about it on the score or else- where. But a very interesting, well-documented circumstantial case for his involve- ment with the Orpheus story has been presented by Owen Jander, "Beethoven's 'Orpheus in Hades,"' 19th-Century Music 8 (1984): 195-212. (Much less persuasive is Jander's attempt to extend an Orpheus reading to the concerto's other movements: "Beethoven's 'Orpheus' Concerto," booklet accompanying the CD recording of the five Beethoven piano concertos by Steven Lubin, Academy of Ancient Music, dir. Chris- topher Hogwood (Oiseau-lyre Florilegium 421 408-2, 1988, 22-25.) Donald Tovey, in a vintage essay dating back to 1902, showed that in effect Beet- hoven's Andante cites Gluck's Orfeo, in which "the pleadings of Orpheus are met phrase by phrase with a thunderous No from the Furies in unison, until the last No is a chord which shows that they will at length yield. [In Beethoven, the orchestra] is entirely in octaves, without a vestige of harmony, so long as it remains stubborn and rough . . . after its first soft pizzicato note it melts into harmony"; Donald Francis Tovey, Essays in Musical Analysis, vol. 3 (London, 1936), 81. 7. There is a weak imitation of the Beethoven in Cesar Franck's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra, weak because Franck unlike Beethoven does not take the dialogue anyplace. Bartok in the slow movements of both his Second and Third Piano Concertos follows Beethoven more freely and imaginatively. 8.

Charles Rosen, Sonata Forms (revised ed., New York, 1988), chap. 5-a rather awkward locution, but more correct than the more usual terms "ritornello form" or "double exposition form." 10. This thread running from the ritornello to the coda begins, in fact, even earlier: E flat can be heard as a reinterpretation of D sharp in the strings' first chord in the initial encounter. So perhaps the solo finally exorcises that chord. 11. Indeed, the solo takes a back seat throughout the exposition. Thus when first-theme material is introduced, it is introduced once again by the orchestra; all the main themes are first heard in the orchestra, with the piano picking them up a few bars later. One of the most beautiful things in this concerto is the way the piano takes the Notes on a Beethoven Concerto 99</page><page sequence="21">measure of the orchestra when it responds to the latter's modulating "second theme," yet the piano never makes this theme its own. The piano takes the lead only in making the modulation to the "bright" dominant key-a traditional prerogative that it indeed accepts, by way of a melody in Beetho- ven's sublime manner at the very top of the keyboard and in a distant, romantic- sounding key, B-flat major. At the same time, this tonal placement distances the piano from the orchestra, which modulates repeatedly and restlessly in this movement but always in the sharp direction. The piano can only be free and assertive outside the orchestra's relational field, it appears. The orchestra does not respond to the piano's reverie, as it also does not respond to another new theme introduced by the piano later, in the development section. 12. The forecast is clearer if we are able to make a reflective association between one of the subjects of Beethoven's brief fugato and a motif in the finale, the three-note cadence figure from the first theme-a motif that grows more and more important as the finale proceeds, as we shall see. Some help from the conductor would be welcome in this case, as in so many others. 13. Rosen, Classical Style, 392. 14. Rosen's remark is on the sleeve of his LP recording of op. 58, with the Symphonica of London, dir. Wyn Morris (Peters PLE 042, 1978). In any case, this peripeteia can have nothing to do with Orpheus regaining and then losing Eurydice, as Owen Jander believes ("Beethoven's 'Orpheus,"' 205, 208- 9). Despite its unanticipated violence, the cadenza unquestionably arises in response to the agon-and not to some new agency or agent, such as a newly introduced Eurydice. The cadenza is the price paid by the solo for its mastery. 15. As noted by Tovey, Essays in Musical Analysis, 81. The final sighing figure in the piano dilates on the strings' characteristic interval G-E, as well as resolving the weird thrusting motif G sharp-A of the cadenza. 16. Works of theoretical interest have been multiplying rapidly, most recently in a double issue of Indiana Theory Review (vol. 12, 1991) devoted entirely to music and narrative. The most important statements are perhaps Fred Everett Maus, "Music as Narrative" and Lawrence Kramer, "Musical Narratology: A Theoretical Outline" in that issue, pp. 1-34 and 141-62; Kramer's Music as Cultural Practice: 1800-1900 (Berkeley, 1990), chap. 6; Carolyn Abbate, Unsung Voices; Jean-Jacques Nattiez, "Can One Speak of Narrativity in Music?," Journal of the Royal Musical Association 115 (1990): 240-57; and two now classic essays by Anthony Newcomb, "Once More 'Between Absolute and Program Music': Schumann's Second Symphony" and "Schumann and Late Eighteenth-Century Narrative Strategies," 19th-Century Music 7 (1984): 233-50 and 11 (1987): 164-74. For a rare attempt to discuss narrative in twentieth-century music, not only eighteenth- and nineteenth-, see Jann Pasler, "Narrative and Narrativity in Music," in Time and Mind: Interdisciplinary Issues, ed. J. T. Fraser (Madison, Wisc. 1989), 233-57. 17. Abbate, Unsung Voices, x-xiii, 19-29, 32-34, 47-56, 123-30, 139-4 1. 18. As to the argument from nostalgia, Abbate charges modern critics with a hankering for the "agreeable charm" of nineteenth-century storytelling analyses, even as they evade-in lingering deference to twentieth-century formalism-the characteristic nineteenth-century association of music with concrete images. Critic A outlines a "tonal narrative" as an interaction of key areas, B posits a combat between genres, C envisages music talking to itself about itself, and so on. The observation is character- istically keen, but the irony is misplaced, for given the collapse of formalist musical 100 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="22">analysis it seems quite all right and in any case inevitable for critics to reexamine older critical modes and reform or transform them for our own difficult times. I see Abbate herself as a D: the uncanny termination of L'Apprenti sorcier, she says, catches the elu- sive narrator's voice in Goethe's ballad; the functional disruptions in the Todtenfeier movement of Mahler's Second Symphony resonate with multiple modal oscillations in Mickiewicz's fantastic drama. At work here is a highly original critique, not a rejection (as with the formalists), of old-style "programmatic" interpretation. 19. It seems a problem, at least, with the classic Western repertory that has occupied most narratologically inclined critics. It should be said again that other music does not depend on large-scale repetitions of this kind. 20. Edward T. Cone, "Schubert's Promissory Note," 19th-Century Music 5 (1982): 240. 21.
