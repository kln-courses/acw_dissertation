<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS THERE A ROMANTIC STYLE? by ALFRED NEUMEYER THE TERM romanticism is used today in a twofold connotation. The first goes back to the original seventeenth-century meaning of the word, "romance- like." In this sense it is applied to every period or per- sonality which expresses the emotional, infinite and sin- gular qualities rather than the rational, definite and gen- eral ones. Walter Pater, for instance, uses the word in this general meaning in his essay, Romanticism. Recent literary historians have tried even to construct a, dialectical system of qualities necessarily connected with the antithetical pair of ideas, classicism and roman- ticism. These characteristics, underlying the two stylistic terms make it evident, it is said, that classicism and romanticism describe "fundamental principles" of human expression. The history of European literature, like the history of European art, is thus reduced to a dialogue between this antagonistic pair of ideas. The second connotation of romanticism limits the use of the term to a definite historical period from about 1800 to 1850, according to the definition given to the new literary movement by the founders. Research has, how- ever, clarified the fact that the beginning of the romantic school goes back to the pre-romantic movement of the Stur.m und Drang in Germany, to the Neo-gothicism in England and to Rousseau in France, that is to the period from 1750 to 1780. This is an important correc- tion of the definition which the romantic school gave itself. It is further evident today that romanticism in the historical sense means the European reaction under the prevailing leadership of the northern nations against the Mediterranean rationalism, especially in its French form. This emancipation of the subdued energies of the individuality expresses itself in sentimentalism which soon after 1760 becomes an internationally accepted English fashion; in nordicism, ever since Macpherson's Ossian mystifications had deceived a world ready and will- ing to be deceived; in gothicism ever since Horace Wal- pole's Castle of Otranto and the neo-gothicism of his house, Strawberry Hill, in emotionalism, ever since Edward Young and Rousseau and the German Sturm und Drang; in historicism and nationalism ever since Herder and the antiquarians' research into the literary and artis- tic traditions of their countries. Although the classicist counter-movement led by Goethe in literature, by David in painting, and by Canova in sculpture, checked pre- romanticism in the decades from 1780 to 1800, romanti- cism became the leading star of the generation of 1800. This ti,me Germany took the most important role. Madame De Stael in her book De I'Allemagne and the lectures of the brothers Schlegel in Paris in 1802, helped to distribute in France the new ideas from Germany. Chateaubriand's Genie du Christianism may be looked upon as analogous to Novalis' Europa oder die Christenheit. The emotionalism of the second part of the eighteenth century was now converted into tran- scendental idealism with a definitely Christian coloring. Romanticism reached its profoundest and most compre- hensive program in the following words of Novalis: "The world must be rornanticised ('romantisiert'). In giving the usual a noble sense, the ordinary a mysterious appearance, the well known the dignity of the unknown, the temporal a perennial aura, I am romanticising." (Fragments VI. 100). Though the first part of this frag- ment could still be connected with the emotionalism of the eighteenth century, the second part with its "peren- nial aura" reveals the religious foundations of German romanticism. But now our problem begins. To what extent have the fine arts created a system of forms (a style) which ex- presses adequately the new doctrine? To what extent does there exist a form which is the homogeneous ex- pression of a transcendental idealism or a mystical piety? And finally, how far do the European nations express their romanticism in a general and international style? If we go back for a, moment to pre-romanticism and Sturm und Drang, we see today that there is a definite anti-classical current in the painting and architecture of the period as well as in the literature. English landscape gardening and the neo-gothic architecture are perhaps its most obvious phenomena in the realm of forms. Both emphasize the sentimental and irrational in the esthetic pleasure, the irregular and picturesque in the esthetic form. Even in painting we can form today a group of pre-romantic works, which express fantastic subject mat- ter in a fitting manner, longing for spontaneity. The Swiss John Henry Fusely, living in England, may be con- sidered as historically the most important figure, since it is he who aroused in William Blake the vibration of the same tone. William Blake in England and Philip Otto Runge in Germany were the first artists who expressed the real romantic zone of ideas. With them the subject matters changed; they changed from mythology to Chris- tianity, from history to nature. But looking at the form and technique of their representation we observe that both preferred drawing to painting, pure linearism of out- line to colorism. While the spray of imagination, the passion of a, cosmic obsession breaks against the limiting walls of their language, their pictorial expression is har- monious, rational and classical. Runge and Blake do not draw differently from the classicist to whom they owe so much, John Flaxman the illustrator of Homer's poems and the designer of Wedgwood's pottery. A well known theorist of the classicist era, has compared the function of drawing with the function of definition in philosophy. The one defines an idea, the other the apparition of an idea in reality. The aim of both is philosophical, both draw the spiritual essence from unessential sensuous perceptions. But definitions of an esthetical system always come later than the artistic creation itself. The fact that painting renounced color voluntarily and sculp- ture gave up movement voluntarily, was chiefly the sign of the exhaustion of the creative energies after the glori- ous finale of the Baroque, a renunciation encouraged THIRTEEN</page><page sequence="2">a posteriori by theory and archeology. The creative accent changed for a while from the fine arts to literature and music. If Blake and Runge expressed their romantic conception of the world in the same optical signs as Flaxman and David expressed their classical concep- tion, this must indicate simply, that the new romantic movement did not have the power to determine the vital condition of the fine arts. Romantic doctrine cried for infinity, but the fine arts insisted on limitation; color and tones floated in mysterious fusions through romantic poetry; but modest in color and motion, painting and sculpture clung to the classicist norms. It must be understood as a desperate effort to bridge the chasm between romantic philosophy and the actual con- dition of the fine arts that Novalis, Frederich Schlegel, and following them, Runge, take refuge in the theory of the hieroglyph as the last meaning of art. From the various formulations about the hieroglyphic character of the arts we choose not the earliest but the Imost illumi- nating given by August Wilhelm Schlegel: "How is it pos- sible to bring the infinite to the surface and to give it appearance? It is possible only symbolically, in images and signs." Here we find forced together by a mystical marriage the infinity of romantic longing and the most definite of abbreviations of visibility, the sign or hieroglyph. The hieroglyph is the condensed microcosmic formula for the unlimited macrocosmic spirit. When we read the se- quence of hieroglyphic signs, the magically enclosed sense becomes apparent again. Therefore, Joseph Goerres, the romantic interpreter of Runge, called Runge's sequence of the four times of the day a "hieroglyphicism of art, a plastic symbolism." Runge himself has formulated his own situation in the following words: "The thing would lead now much more to the use of arabesques and hiero- glyphics, but from this landscape must result." His prophecy became reality in the landscape paintings of his countryman, Caspar David Friedrich. In Friedrich's earliest oil painting, The Cross on the Mountain, from 1810, (Dresden Gallery) the connection with Runge is still visible in the hieroglyphs of the carved frame and the arabesque-like arrangement of the composition, but Friedrich overcame here the worst enemies of really romantic art; the anthropomorphic and the spaceless. Blake, as well as Runge, had expressed his romantic tran- scendental ideas exclusively by human bodies; (Runge added plants) in a spaceless abstract realm. It was hard to draw from these traditionally classical elements an irrational, anticlassical meaning. Friedrich made un- limited space and unanimated nature the symbols of his romanticism. The first step for an emancipation of paint- ing from its exhausted classicism was taken. But still we feel a tragic antagonism between the romantic inten- tion and its optical formulation. Does this not find its ex- planation in the sentence of Friedrich Schlegel: "Indeed this is its real essence (romanticism's), that it is always on its way to be, that it never can be." (Fragments 116). Friedrich's landscapes are symbols of the absolute, but he must present these symbols with the limited means of matter-and how reduced are the means handed over to this generation by an exhausted art! The romanticists make out of their poverty a virtue. They rediscover now the art of the Middle Ages and justify their lack of color- ism as well as their linearism by the art of Durer. For Greek vase painting they substitute Durer and Fra Angel- ico but fundamentally their esthetic is not different from the esthetic of classicism. Does it not sound rather classical when Friedrich Schlegel describes his ideal: "No confused crowds of people but few and isolated figures, but finished with the industry which conforms to the feeling of the dignity and sanctity of the highest of all hieroglyphs, the human body; severe, even meagre forms in sharp outlines, com- ing out distinctly, no painting with clairobscur and dirt, performed with night-or cast shadows, but pure propor- tions and masses of colors as in clear chords. ." Does one not hear Goethe's and David's theories draped now in a light mantle of Christianity? And, indeed, if we look at the contemporary art growing from this doc- trine, the Nazarene School of Overbeck and Cornelius and their descendants in England and France, we see that the classical elements in Fra Angelico, Botticelli and Raphael have determined this style of clear local colors and definite completeness of outline. Must we therefore conclude that romanticism was not able to create a style in the fine arts? Does romanticism in the fine arts mean: classical form, romantic subject matter? Is there no way to find an adequate expression for romantic irrationalism in the realm of forms? Is romantic painting necessarily condemned forever to a tragic struggle between intention and realization? The answer comes from France. Let us take it as a symbol of the situation that Napoleon was accompanied during his campaign in Egypt and Italy by two books: Ossian's poems and Goethe's Werther. The northern emotionalism worked for the rescue of the French indi- viduality. After some pre-romantic paintings in classicist form but with the subject matters from Ossian or Chateaubriand, Gericault's Rape of the Medusa ap- peared. Movement, action, drama are there, though still represented in the half classical forms taken from Michaelangelo and Caravaggio. Together with the romantic poets of 1820 rose Delacroix. His passion looked around for homogeneous helpers and found Constable and Rubens. Two northern masters again assist the artist to find his own system of forms and colors, a system able to express the burning flames of his romantic spirit. A medal of the time by Deveria shows Delacroix in the front, Lord Byron on the reverse. The paradoxical situation becomes obvious: while the motherland of romanticism, Germany, in the fine arts was unable to get rid of the Mediterranean classical formula, France on the other side created with the help of German influences an art which found a spontaneous unity between romantic spirit and form. How is this pos- sible? The solution seems revealed to us by a sentence of Theophile Gautier, "Delacroix veut donner la sensation de la chose qu'il represente dans son essence meme et non dans sa realite photographique." The word "sensation" can not be translated into the ter- FOURTEEN</page><page sequence="3">minology of German romanticism. It does not exist. In- stead of it we would find there the word Idee (idea) of the thing. The French romanticist discovers the sensa- tions of reality, its appeal to the senses, to nerves, to our "sensorium"; the German romanticist is in search of the idea underlying this so-called reality. In the one case there is a profound distrust in the "existence of the existent"; it is regarded as important only as a signal pointing to a secret meaning behind it. In the other case reality is identical with existence. The native realism of the Latin heritage transforms even the form- less, transcendent Nordic romanticism back into a romantic sensualism of purest French character. This belief in the sensuous beauty of reality and in the sensations of life can find a direct, spontaneous expres- sion in painting. Instead of standing aloof from matter instinctively, like the German romanticists, Delacroiv stood aloof rationally from his own passion. The Byronesque chara.cter appears in Baudelaire's translucent words about him: "Delacroix etait passionnement amoureux de la passion, et froidement determine a chercher les moyens d'exprimer la passion de la maniere ia plus visible." The actuality of French romanticism instead of the ideal- ity of German romanticism enables it to believe in visi- bility. This belief in the here and now is what creates the bridge between the spiritual "sensations" and their optical apparition. Therefore, French romanticism was politically active, liberal and revolutionary, while German romanticism turned toward Catholicism and political con- servatism. Can one imagine a formula more hostile to Chinese Bronze Chueh, Shang-Yin Dynasty? 1766?-1122 B.C. Height 8% inches German romanticism than Stendhal's sentences: "Le Romanticisme est I'art de presenter aux peuples les oeuvres litteraires qui, dans l'etat actuel de leurs habi- tudes et de leurs croyances, sont susceptibles de leur donner le plus plaisir possible." This facing l'etat actuel without being bound to mere actuality was what made the movement represented by Delacroix and Stendhal more universally understand- able than the mysterious and tragic episode of German romanticism. It can be seen clearly, now, that roman- ticism, with its irrational background, enfolds itself in different national styles while classicism, with its ration- alism, creates a uniform, international formula. The greatness and the limitations of romanticism become evident in the fact that no German artist was really able to make visible, that is to illustrate, Goethe's Faust. But Delacroix was. The sensualism of the French imagin- ation had found a way to make visible even the invisible. But how small and shallow seems this visibility compared with Goethe's imaginative realm. The deep difference between the two romanticisms is nowhere more obvious than in Delacroix's effort to translate from the German to the French. Each nation has created an independent realm, the one typically finding the last solution in philos- ophy and music, the other in the novel and in painting German romanticism has the melancholy of a hieroglyph from which the divine language can only be deciphered in fragments, while French, romanticism has the demonic vitality of a mind which has lost its source, and knows it.
