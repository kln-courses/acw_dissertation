<plain_text><page sequence="1">WORDS TO REMEMBER MARBLE, page 14 Foliation-in marble, the natu- ral layering or planar orienta- tion of mica flakes, flattened calcite grains and other com- ponents of the stone. Isotopes-elements with an identical number of protons in their nuclei, but a different number of neutrons. Isotopes have the same atomic number, differing atomic weights, and almost the same chemical properties. Isotopie signature-the isoto- pie ratios characteristic of a rock, artifact or other object due to isotopie fractionation; fractionation is the process of separating or dividing a mix- ture into component parts or smaller units. Lineation-the parallel orienta- tion of structural features in a rock that are lines rather than planes, as in foliation. Such features include long dimen- sions of minerals, long axes of pebbles, grooves or faulted surfaces, and streaks of min- erals. Mass spectrometer-an in- strument which separates molecules or atoms according to their mass, employed to separate different atomic mas- ses or isotopes in the same element. Polanzing microscope-a mi- croscope used in mineralogy and petrography which uses polarizing prisms or sheets to examine optical properties of minerals and the fabrics of rocks. Spectroscopy-any optical in- strument which forms and ex- amines spectra; spectrog raph- ic analysis is done by obtaining the spectrum of a substance and matching lines in the spec- trum with known wave lengths of lines in the spectra of the elements. INDUSTRIAL PATERSON, page 22 Flume-a trough or channel built to convey water from a raceway or canal to a mill to tum the waterwheel. Headgate-the gates used to regulate the flow of water from a raceway into a flume. Headrace-the portion of the raceway carrying water toward a millwheel. Millseat-a property lot de- signed specifically for occu- pancy by a mill. Overshot wheel -the most effi- cient form of vertical water- wheels; water from a flume is carried over the top of the wheel and dropped vertically onto the paddles or buckets. Raceway-a canal intended to carry water to a millwheel for power and to channel exhaust water away. Tailrace-the portion of the raceway intended to carry ex- haust water away from a mill and its wheel. Wheel-pit-an open shallow well where a waterwheel could be mounted. EARLY AGRICULTURE, page 30 Backed bladelet-a flaked stone tool on which one elon- gated edge has been blunted by retouching. Burin-a flaked stone tool whose exact functions are un- known although there is some indication they were used for cutting and grooving wood, bone or antler. Denticulate-a flaked stone tool with serrated edges thought to have been used for cutting. Glume-the floral segments of grasses or segments of grass flowers. Notch-a flaked stone tool on which a retouched concavity has been made along one or more edges. Rachis-the axis of the spike of a grass. Spike-the floral cluster of a grass; the unit of the spike containing one or more flow- ers is known as a spikelet. PERUVIAN ARCHAEOL- OGY, page 37 Cajamarca-dating from ca. a.D. 1-1532, this prehistoric culture of the Peruvian north highlands is characterized by its fine kaolin pottery deco- rated with geometric, con- ventional or abstract animal designs. Ceque-the Quechua term for "ray" or "line." The complex ceque calendar system refers to 13 major lines radiating from a single point that em- body the spatial, temporal and hierarchical aspects of central Andean cosmology, later adopted and elaborated by the Incas. Chavín- characterized by its highly homogeneous art style and iconography dominated by jaguars, caymans, birds of prey and anthropomorphic ¡figures with feline features; Chavin culturally unified much of ancient Peru. Chimu-coastal culture cen- tered at the impressive cap- ital of Chan Chan near mod- em Trujillo believed to date from about a.d. 900 to the Inca conquest in around a.d. 1460-70. Classic Lambayeque-the pre- historic culture centered in the Lambayeque region (ca. a.d. 850-1350) distinguished by fu- nerary objects found at its heart- land in Batan Grande. Cupisnique-the North Coast culture (ca. 1500-500 b.c.) characterized by monumental adobe temples with polychrome murals and friezes depicting stylized creatures with feline fea- tures, related to Chavin. Huaca-the Quechua word meaning "sacred place," also used to signify archaeological sites especially pyramids or mounds; grave looters are known as huaqueros. Moche-the prehistoric North Coast culture dating from as early as 200 b.c. to a.D. 700, best known for its fine ceramic vessels with naturalistic paint- ings and realistic portrait ves- sels. Wari-the central highland culture centered around mod- em Ayacucho, tentatively dated to about a.d. 550 to 800, whose influence was felt in much of Peru north of Cuzco. PELLA, page 46 Caananite culture-a pre-He- braic name for ancient Pales- tine and some adjacent areas. The people spoke a Semitic language and had a sophisti- cated culture including elegant pottery, elaborate religious myths and rituals, and well- organized city states through- out much of the second millen- nium B.C. Decapolis-commercial feder- ation of ten cities in northern Transjordan nearby regions presumably created by the Ro- man general Pompey in 65 B.C. Hasmonean kingdom-small kingdom established in an- cient Palestine by several members of the Maccabean, or Hasmonean family, who instigated a revolt of the Jews of Palestine against the Seleucid Empire, lasting until the arrival of the Romans in 64 b.c. Tyche-Greek term for "for- tune" or "good luck" which took the form of a goddess; each Greek Hellenistic city often had its own Tyche re- presented in statuary and coins. 80 Archaeology</page></plain_text>
