This paper argues that the works of both authors underline a "rationalization process" that occured in Western societies. We compare the respective analyses of Weber and Veblen on this subject. Despite a formal similarity, the analysis manifests some major divergences concerning the nature and the significance of the rationalization process. We suggest that the major divergences originate in the philosophical and epistemological foundations of the work of each author. Keywords: Max Weber, Thorstein Veblen, rationalization, neo-Kantianism, pragmatism JEL Classification Codes : B15, B41, Z13 One of the founders of modern sociology, Max Weber (1864-1920), is also more generally considered as one of the most important social scientists in the history of the social sciences. A typical product of the German intellectual milieu oi the second part of the nineteenth century, Weber wrote numerous books and articles in economics, sociology, history and epistemology that are even today the subject of endless discussions and interpretations. Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929), is a contemporary of Weber but he is certainly not as well known as Weber. His profile is however similar: Veblen's work transcends disciplinary boundaries and includes economical, sociological and philosophical elements. Like Weber, Veblen is a typical intellectual of the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries, an author ignoring the ? at that time ? unclear disciplinary boundaries and proposing historical and theoretical analysis aimed at the explanation of the origins of modern societies. The author is a PhD student and teaches at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France. He thanks Herve Guillemin, Richard Adkisson and two anonymous referees for their comments on a previous version of this paper.

In any case, it is rarely treated in an adequate and systematic way (Kilpinen 2004). To undertake a wide ranging analytical and historical comparison of Veblen's and Weber's respective works and careers is an important task that is necessary from several points of view: first, from a purely historical perspective, both authors write at a time (end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries) of important economic and social transformation, resulting in the emergence of modern capitalism. A careful and comparative analysis of their works might enable us to have a better understanding of this period, with respect to the differences between the cultural environments in which these authors were writing. More importantly, on an analytical level, the confrontation of Weber's and Veblen's works must help with a reflection on the core principles of a socio-economic analysis and, more specifically, on the epistemological and theoretical identity of what can be called the "institutionalist tradition" in economics.1 Clearly such an important task cannot be undertaken here. So in this paper we deliberately restrict ourselves to the study of a theme that appears in a more or less systematical manner in the works of Veblen and Weber, namely the rationalization process, which affects economies and societies in the course of history. It is widely known that Weber's writing are focused on one main issue, the question of the specificity of modern Western capitalism. All through his writings, Weber analyzed the causes and the dynamics of the rationalization process that brought along the emergence of modern capitalism. In Veblen's works we find a theory of cultural evolution and of the dynamics of institutions. While it is true that this theory is rarely seen as an analysis of the "rationalization process," we can still note that one basic idea is that Western civilization leads individuals to be more and more "factual" and less inclined to all sorts of metaphysical speculations. We start this analysis with a generic definition of the concept of rationalization as an evolutionary and historical process in the course of which a certain form of logic of action, oriented toward a productive and/or commercial efficiency and characterized by a decline of myths and superstitions to the benefit of "scientific" explanation, is progressively imposing itself The aim of this paper is to determine how the respective analyses of Weber and Veblen of the rationalization process, within the framework of this definition, are convergent. With this perspective in mind, the first part of the paper shows that the problems and the analyses of Veblen and Weber have many formal similarities. Then we underline some of the most important substantive divergences between them and show in a third part that they primarily originate in the respective epistemological foundations that underlie the works of the two authors. Finally, we conclude by identifying some possible further elaboration of this topic.</page><page sequence="3">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 169 Some Formal Convergences The Rationalization Process and the Theory of Knowledge A first element shared by the analyses of both Veblen and Weber about rationalization is that they are developed on the basis of a theory of knowledge and science. Weber and Veblen both took the development of scientific activity and the evolution of the scientific method to be illustrations of the rationalization process affecting Western civilization. In Veblen's works, this aspect clearly appears in his theory of scientific preconceptions, which he developed in a series of articles entitled "The Preconceptions of Economic Science" (Veblen 1899a; 1899b; 1900; see also Veblen 1908)2 and also in one of his major books, The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (Veblen [1914] 2006). Veblen developed the idea that all scientific work necessarily relies on some metaphysical postulates, non-demonstrable by definition, called "preconceptions." In this sense, all scientific discovery is in part the result of postulates the scientist sees as obvious, postulates which are at the same time the starting points and the general framework of his analysis. For Veblen, if the presence of preconceptions is inevitable, it didn't mean however that their content is forever immutable. On the contrary, they are subject like other habits of thought to a process of selection.3 Analyzing the development of economic thought from the Physiocrats up to Alfred Marshall, Veblen pointed to a progressive transformation of the preconceptions underlying the works of economists. The writings of the Physiocrats are characterized by the large predominance of "animistic" preconceptions (Veblen also spoke of "teleological preconceptions" and "preconceptions of normality"). They consist in interpreting all observed phenomena in terms of final causes, as if the evolution of the natural and social worlds have to tend to some sort of natural equilibrium state. Progressively, matter-of-fact preconceptions will substitute animistic ones, which means that economists will more often start from the postulate that all phenomena have to be strictly analyzed in terms of causal relationships without making any supposition related to the existence of a natural order or an equilibrium state. Although Veblen didn't think that economics had reached the state of an evolutionary science yet (Veblen 1898), he considered most modern sciences to be based on matter-of-fact preconceptions (Veblen 1906 and 1908). The key point is Veblen's generalization of his preconception theory by arguing that these two ways of apprehending phenomena characterize the totality of human cognition: "The same features of human thinking, the same two complementary methods of correlating facts and handling them for the purposes of knowledge, are similarly in constant evidence in the daily life of men in our own community. The question is, in great part, which of the two bears the greater part in shaping human knowledge at any given time and within any given range of knowledge or of facts" (Veblen 1899a, 102). So the evolution of scientific preconceptions is explained by the more general evolution of the habits oi thought and action of individuals,</page><page sequence="4">170 Cyril Hedoin which themselves are the result of the evolution of ways of life: "The scheme of thought or of knowledge is in good part a reverberation of the scheme of life. So that, after all has been said, it remains true that with the growth of industrial organization and efficiency there must, by selection and by adaptation, supervene a greater resort to the mechanical or dispassionate method of apprehending facts" (Veblen 1899a, 105). For Veblen, the evolution of scientific thought is an epiphenomenon on the one hand of the evolution of habits of thought and on the other hand of the importance of the animistic and matter-of-fact schemes of logic.4 In other words, science is the product of the existing cultural environment: "science and the scientific point of view will vary characteristically in response to those variations in the prevalent habits of thought which constitute the sequence of cultural development; the current science and the current scientific point of view, the knowledge sought and the manner of seeking it, are a product of the cultural growth" (Veblen 1908, 38). Though rarely put forward, Weber's work also takes scientific thought to be an illustration of the rationalization of people's ways of life. This point is made particularly clear in his epistemological writings (Weber [1903-06] 1975 and 1949) and in his work on religion (Weber [1905] 2005 and [1922] 1978). In the foreword of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber argued that modern science is in part the product of Western society's social structure: modern science has to be seen as the product and the consequence of the rationalization process. But it is mainly in his treatment of the value problem, a central issue in Weber's work (see Weber 1948 and 1949), that we can find the essence of this idea on the link between modern science and rationalization: civilized man, a product of the rationalization process, is characterized by his ability to take up a position with regard to values and to choose between them, although he is conscious that in fine this choice cannot rationally be justified.5 It is somebody "who deliberately attributes a meaning to the world because there is no indisputable worthy meaning anymore; only in superior cultures can people reflectively attribute a meaning to their values and not blindly follow them" (Colliot-Thelene 1990, 68, our translation). It is this emancipation from the values, this capacity of people to reflect on them, Weber argued, which founds the very possibility of the cultural sciences: "The transcendental presupposition of every cultural science lies not in our finding a certain culture or any 'culture' in general to be valuable but rather in the fact that we are cultural beings, endowed with the capacity and the will to take a deliberate attitude towards the world and to lend it significance' (Weber 1904, 166-167). Put in different words, the very essence of scientific activity is the ability to give a meaning to our environment and this ability is a cultural product, not an ahistorical human capacity. Therefore, the scientific objectivity claimed by Weber is itself an historical concept, namely a product of rationalization (Colliot-Thelene 1990). The ideal type of goal-oriented rational action, which Weber used as a tool for interpreting all actions, has to be conceived both as an idealization of behaviors in modern capitalism and as the result of the state of development of cultural sciences. Therefore, from the point of view of both Weber and Veblen modern science is the product of the rationalization process. This argument is particularly important</page><page sequence="5">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 171 because it means that both authors, although from different perspectives, see science as an "embedded" sphere in the more global process of the evolution and rationalization of behaviors. In this way, in submitting scientific preconceptions to the general evolution of the habits of thought, Veblen indicated that the perception by science of the evolutionary dimension of society assumes that socio-cultural conditions make the development of such an evolutionary thinking possible. In other words, the interpretation of persons of their environment is specific to the interpretation system promulgated by this environment: there is no meta-criterion allowing a selection between different preconceptions at a particular time. Consequently, the fact that scientists perceive their environment in a more and more factual way is in itself an indication that the functioning of the environment is more "factual." On the other side, Weber thought, in a neo-kantian way, that the very existence of sciences (in particular, social sciences) depends on their possibility to be objective: a science can only exist if it is "objective." From this point of view, by questioning the objectivity of the social sciences, Weber tried to underline the cultural preconditions to such an objectivity. By demonstrating that the social sciences can claim to be objective, Weber indirectly showed that a social and cultural process has occurred allowing the development of a "rational" and therefore objective science. In both cases, the structure of the demonstration is the same. First it is shown that contemporary sciences have evolved in a specific way (toward either more objectivity or a more factual character). Then it is said that this evolution requires the satisfaction of some socio-cultural conditions. It is possible therefore to deduce that these conditions, in the form of a rationalization process, have been effectively fulfilled. In the analysis of both authors, there is some sort of hermeneutic circle: we are aware of the rationality of modern societies because of the emergence of a scientific logic, which is itself the product of a logic of actions caused by this process. It is the rationalization process that makes its own study possible, which means that the very fact that science is able to interpret society as "rational" or "factual" is the ultimate proof that society, because it makes this sort of interpretation possible, can effectively be characterized like this. In Weber's as in Veblen's works, the analysis of the rationalization process falls within an autoreferential framework. A Historical and Genetic Analysis of Capitalism Weber and Veblen both approached the rationalization process through a historical and genetic analysis. In both cases, in a more or less explicit way, the problem is to reconstruct the capitalist society's genesis in order to have a better understanding of its specificities. All Weber's works are designed to give reasons why modern capitalism appeared only in the Western world and not in other regions of the world. He made Western rationalism, the specificity of which is put forward in his works on world religions, the decisive factor of the apparition of modern rational capitalism. To Weber's mind, economic sociology - of which he is himself one of the precursors - has to study the way economic rationality appears and develops as part oi a larger historical movement</page><page sequence="6">172 Cyril Hedoin (Swedberg 1998). Rational behavior is therefore not to be considered, in Weber's works, as a starting assumption. It is mostly a historical concept whose dynamics of evolution has to be retraced. While rationality is the starting point of "pure" economic analysis, in Weber's economic sociology it is a phenomena that has to be explained and cannot be considered as given.6 Moreover, this rationalization process is not circumscribed to the economic realm and Weber also analyzed it in religious, political and juridical spheres (see especially Weber [1922] 1978). In the fourth and last chapter of General Economic History (Weber [1923] 2003), he insisted more specifically on three types of factors that contribute to the emergence of modern capitalism: economic, political and religious. Within each of these factors a rationalization movement can be identified (Swedberg 1998, Chap. 1). For Weber capitalism was ultimately generated by rational firms, rational accounting, rational technique and rational law. Furthermore, "[n] ecessary complementary factors were the rational spirit, the rationalization of the conduct of life in general, and a rationalistic economic ethic" (Weber [1923] 1984, 260), an ethic of which Weber has studied the emergence in his work on the Protestant religion (Weber [1905] 2005). Starting from the Darwinian methodological principles which he stated in his article "Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science?" (Veblen 1898), Veblen developed a theory of cultural evolution that aims to give an explanation of development through the history of the matter-of-fact preconceptions. Though Veblen's theory is rarely represented as an attempt to analyze the genesis and development of capitalism,7 it is nevertheless possible to see it as an analysis whose aim is to grasp the causal origins of rationalism, which Veblen sees as a distinctive feature of his era. As Robin Neill (2006) suggests, Veblen's theory of cultural evolution was not intended to make any kind of predictions but to apprehend the cumulative sequence of events: "It was a set of historical accounts based on a different kind of theory of cumulative endogenous change" (Neill 2006, 677). Veblen's analysis results in a distinction between four evolutionary stages that industrial society passes through: primitive savagery, barbarism, the handicraft era and the machine era. Though largely inspired by Veblen's readings of some German economists, this stages theory has to be viewed in a retrospective way. Veblen didn't try to show that all societies will necessarily pass through the identified stages as some German economists have done, but rather to state the path of evolution of the modern industrial society. Rationalism/Traditionalism (Weber) and Animist/Matter-of-Fact Preconceptions (Veblen) Veblen and Weber defined the essence of the rationalization process in a similar way, though the terms and concepts used are different. Thus, in Weber's works, the movement of rationalization is conceived as the result of a decline of traditionalism compared to rationalism. Traditionalism designates all ancient customs and more generally all non-economic factors that undermine the</page><page sequence="7">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 173 "spiritual autonomy" of the individuals and, consequently, the rationality based on economic calculation. In Weber's writings, traditionalism is figured in religious or magical practices and in interests linked to political or social matters. Rationalism means formal rationality, i.e., the potentially quantitative expression of an economic activity (Weber [1922] 1978) as well as also material rationality, i.e., the provisioning of some human groups in respect to economic and "non-economic" criteria (ethical, political, utilitarian, etc.) from a value-rational or goal-rational perspective. The propensity to calculate and to measure is thus a dimension of rationalism and Weber linked this with the emergence of money and markets. Modern "rational" capitalism is characterized by the predominance of rationalism, though Weber underlined the continuing influence of non-economic factors. He thus conceptualizes the process as a two-way profit-search rationalization: the importance of calculation, essentially in monetary units, and the overshadowing of tradition (Demeulenaere 2003), i.e., the ability to depart from it (or follow it) consciously. The development of this rational ethic precedes and generates rational capitalism, which Weber contrasted with "political capitalism" and "traditional capitalism" (Weber [1922] 1978). Though based on a radically different terminology, Veblen's definition of the rationalization process is similar to Weber's definition, at least formally. As indicated above, Veblen's analysis of the rationalization process can be viewed as an extension of his scientific preconceptions theory, which opposes animistic to matter-of-fact preconceptions, to the habits of thought of all the members of a given society. Therefore, in Veblen's work rationalization is defined as a relative increase of the importance of material and factual reasoning compared to conventional and archaic reasoning: With due but not large exceptions, the effective body of the modern population has been growing more matter-of-fact in their thinking, less romantic, less idealistic in their aspirations, less bound by metaphysical considerations in their view of human relations, less mannerly, less devout. (Veblen [1904] 2005, 164) This evolution of the habits of thought of individuals induces through aggregation a transformation of institutions: Veblen thus opposed industrial and pecuniary institutions and shows that only the former are efficient and useful to the community. However, just as Weber underlined the existence of some factors constraining economic rationality, Veblen noted (and regrets) the persistence of some "imbecile institutions" that disturb the functioning of industry by diverting economic activities from a productive efficiency to the benefit of "useless" activities, while supporting a large part of the population. It therefore seems that there is a clear formal proximity between Weber's and Veblen's analyses of the rationalization process: in addition to the autoreferential nature of their analysis of the rationalization process (i.e., their scientific characterization of modern society as the result of a process of rationalization reflects the effectiveness of this process), both authors developed their analyses in an</page><page sequence="8">174 Cyril Hedoin evolutionary and historical framework whose aim is to give a theoretical account of the specific evolution of the Western world. Finally, in both cases, we can see that the rationalization process is depicted as a clash between two forms of logic of action and of apprehension of phenomena. Nevertheless, we can already see that there are some substantial divergences. A more detailed analysis of Weber's "rationalism" and Veblen's matter-of-fact preconceptions is needed. Some Substantial Divergences: Causes and Interpretations of the Rationalization Process Veblen's "Objective" Technological Determinism versus Weber's "Subjective" Idealism Although Weber and Veblen both conceptualized the evolution of rationalization as a process in which some sort of "rational logic" surpasses a traditional logic, a more detailed analysis shows that they don't build this rational logic on the same elements. In fact, the substance of the rationalization of these two authors is quite contradictory. It is necessary to go back to Veblen's preconceptions theory in more detail. As shown above, he argued that ways of thinking reflect ways of life. In other words, the rationalization of habits of thought is to be found in the rationalization of the way of life of individuals in modern society. At this point, Veblen gave great importance to the material conditions of life and more precisely to technology. The fourth and last stage, the machine era, even if it doesn't correspond to the emergence of capitalism,8 designates a period where the material conditions of life and production are greatly dependant on technology and machines. The "machine process" thus leads to a standardization of behavior that inculcates in individuals quantitative precision and discipline: The discipline of the machine process enforces a standardization of conduct and of knowledge in terms of quantitative precision, and inculcates a habit of apprehending and explaining facts in terms of material cause and effect. It involves a valuation of facts, things, relations, and even personal capacity, in terms of force. Its metaphysics is materialistic and its point of view is that of causal sequence. Such a habit of mind conduces to industrial efficiency, and the wide prevalence of such habit is indispensable to a high degree of industrial efficiency under modern conditions. (Veblen [1904] 2005, 37) For Veblen ([1904] 2005; [1914] 2006), the machine era started in England around 1750 with the first industrial revolution but it appeared openly only in the nineteenth century. Because of the increasing importance of technology and machines, individuals had to develop some specific capacities, which were not necessary before. They had to acquire a specific knowledge implying a complete rejection of all anthropomorphic or animistic interpretations of phenomena:</page><page sequence="9">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 175 The norm of systematisation is that given by the logic of the machine process, and the scope of it is that inculcated by statistical computation and the principle of material cause and effect. (Veblen [1914] 2006, 311) Both in its incidence on the workman and on the members of the community at large, therefore, the training given by this current state of the industrial arts is a training in the impersonal, quantitative apprehension and appreciation of things, and it tends strongly to inhibit and discredit all imputation of spiritual traits to the facts of observation. It is a training in matter-of-fact; more specifically it is a training in the logic of the machine process (318). In fine, the machine process causes the emergence of a new way of comprehending the notion of causality: in place of what Veblen called "sufficient reason" individuals will think in terms of "efficient cause".9 Veblen's rationalization has a substantive content (while Weber's has a formal content: see below), which means that this process causes a "qualitative" alteration of the habits of thought of individuals. Generally speaking, it means that the rationalization process teaches individuals how to think "differently" in reaction to the transformation of their environment. So we can say that in Veblen's works rationalization has an objective dimension since it modifies the individual's behavior uniformly. The importance that Veblen's cultural evolution theory gives to technology has been criticized (see, for example, Hodgson 2004, Chap. X) and leads him to be considered as a technological determinist (for example, Dugger 2006). Veblen's technological determinism is however weakened by the role he gives to archaic and animist habits in this framework. While the physical foundation oi modern economy is technology, for him (Veblen [1904] 2005, Chap. IV) its spiritual basis was the institution of property. He saw property as the main pecuniary institution and a residue of animistic preconceptions. While these preconceptions have however tended to decline as a whole throughout history, the institution of property has been extended, this extension being interpreted as the consequence of the habits of thought of pecuniary economy. Capitalism can thus be interpreted in Veblen's works as an unstable economic system and a product of the rationalization process in which some animistic and pecuniary preconceptions persist. The survival of the capitalist system depends on two antagonist spheres, the industrial and the pecuniary spheres. The very existence of capitalism relies on the incompletion of the rationalization process. Weber's interpretation of both rationalization and capitalism is clearly different from that of Veblen. In Weber's works, capitalism is the ultimate result of the rationalization process, a statement of its supremacy. The real divergence concerns the factors leading to rationalization. While Veblen made technology the main factor, Weber was critical toward any form of technological determinism and refused to speak of an "industrial revolution" (Swedberg 1998). As said above, the monetary</page><page sequence="10">176 Cyril Hedoin economy is the origin of the formal economic rationality. It is with the development of money and monetary exchange that the economic calculation takes an increasing importance in economic life and that the pursuit of profit can be rationalized. Rational capitalism is the product of the rationalization of economic life (Weber [1923] 1984 In Weber's work monetary (or "pecuniary" in Veblen's terms) elements are integral components of the rationalization process, but an opposing force for Veblen. Economic rationalization (of a monetary and not an industrial nature) is only a part of a larger whole. In his writings from 1910 to 1920 on world religions, Weber specified the real meaning of rationalization. While in The Protestant Ethic (Weber [1905] 2005) it is defined as the elimination of magic practices as salvation techniques, in later writings it designates the "weakening of the religious control on the general representations that men make of their environment" (Colliot-Thelene 1990, 65, our translation), for example as it is developed by Weber in his famous lecture "Science as a Vocation": The increasing intellectualization and rationalization do not, therefore, indicate an increased and general knowledge of the conditions under which one lives. It means something else, namely, the knowledge or belief that if one but wished one could learn it at any time. Hence, it means that principally there are no mysterious incalculable forces that come into play, but rather that one can, in principle, master all things by calculation. This means that the world is disenchanted. (Weber 1948: 139) This rationalization of the spheres of action doesn't originate in the rationalization of the sphere of values but in the increasing distance from these values. Thus, there is a subjective and formal dimension in Weber's rationalization process: rationalization achievements are not necessarily the same in all religions or all cultures. There are many ways through which rationalization can manifest itself. We find in the Weberian analysis a duality between, on the one hand, a logic of evolution that makes rationalization a universal trend for all societies (through religion) and, on the other hand, a dynamic of evolution that conceptualizes the many ways of concretization of this logic (Raynaud 1996). Despite the many ambiguities of Weber's comparatism, it seems clear that this analysis avoids any materialistic or deterministic path. Unlike Veblen, for Weber the origin of the rationalization process was not to be found in the evolution of technology, which through an orientation of the habits of thought of individuals induces a selection of institutions, but essentially (not exclusively) in the economic ethics of different religions making a decline of traditionalism more or less probable.</page><page sequence="11">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 177 Interpretation and Normative Evaluation of the Rationalization Process Although seemingly more anecdotic, the normative divergences concerning the two authors evaluation of the rationalization process can add some light on their respective analyses. We can observe a radical opposition on this point between Weber and Veblen. Weber's well known iron cage metaphor depicts his vision of capitalism and rationalization. All along in his writings he argued that formal rationalization - i.e., the increase of rationality in a sense of calculability and previsibility - leads to a loss of liberty (Vandenberghe 1997). For Weber, modernity seemed to be characterized by a progressive shift from a goal-oriented rationality in the widest sense to a more restrictive rationality:10 there is a "dialectic of Reason" (Raynaud 1996) resulting from the conflict between, on the one hand, the fact that rationalization makes individuals more autonomous and, on the other hand, the incommensurability of the various systems of values, leading to an autonomization of the economic system. Once the rational capitalism has emerged from the effect of the aggregation resulting from the economic practices supported by the Calvinist ethic, the system continues to operate independently of any religious or ethical considerations. Rational capitalism becomes a machine-like system imposing its mechanisms to all individuals: life has been rationalized in his functioning, but at the price of a considerable restriction of the aims pursued by human activity. For Weber, modern capitalism clearly represented the achievement of the rationalization process, concerning its virtues as much as in its defects.11 On this normative stance Veblen is clearly opposed to Weber. It is true that Veblen's writings develop a powerful criticism of the industrial capitalist society of his day. As it is relatively well known, Veblen argued that pecuniary institutions, in particular the institution of property, help to create predatory and parasitic behaviors, disturbing industrial activities and weakening their efficiency. In the capitalist system, business controls industry with the short-term perspective of making pecuniary profits. These pecuniary gains are obtained through predatory and speculative practices that do not contribute to industrial efficiency. In the long run however, pecuniary profits (and therefore the survival of the capitalist) ultimately rely on how industry performs (Veblen [1914] 2006, Chap. 7). But it is precisely because business needs industry that Veblen believed that the rationalization process can be allowed to go past the chaotic capitalist system. This claim relies on several elements: first, the capitalist "system" is inherently instable because it is based on the combination of two antagonistic types of institutions (industrial and pecuniary); then, with the increasing complexity of industrial operations, business owners are less and less able to control the productive process directly (Veblen [1914] 2006, 345). The result of this inability is the emergence of a new social class, the "efficiency engineers," who play the role of intermediaries between the business and industrial spheres. Finally, the function of businessmen is made obsolete by the rationalization process itself. This process generated by technological developments and caused by industrial activities opens the door, to a</page><page sequence="12">178 Cyril Hedoin "technocratic revolution" (Gislain 2000) leading to a concretization of the matter-of fact preconceptions, resulting from the elimination of the last archaic residues. Consequently, it appears that Weber and Veblen disagree on the essence of the rationalization process, and on its normative valuation. But the analysis can't stop at this point: we have to question the philosophical and methodological principles on which the works of Weber and Veblen are built. We will then be able to understand the convergences and divergences we have just underlined better. Weber, Veblen and the Rationalization Process: An Epistemological Interpretation A Double Movement: Historicization of Theory/Theorization of History Without restating what has been said in the first two parts and without ignoring the clear elements of opposition underlined above on the question of the rationalization process, we think that the analysis of Weber and Veblen coincide through a double movement: a historicization of theory and a theorization of history. The "historicization of theory" can be found in the works of both authors when they study the foundations of modern science. This historicization of theory appears in Veblen's works in his preconceptions theory: Veblen argued that the development of a theory and its concepts depend on the scientist's environment. Scientific preconceptions, as well as any other habits of thought, are subject to the natural selection, and therefore any theory has to be ready to develop and adapt itself to new conditions. Knowledge is relative to the context in two ways: it is relative to the period when it was developed, and it is relative to the object with which it deals. In Weber's works, the historicization of theory is obtained through the ideal-type theory and the value-relevance issue. Both elements stem from the Neo-Kantian philosophy and more specifically from the work of the German philosopher Heinrich Rickert (see especially Rickert [1902] 1986). The value-relevance approach means that in social sciences, because of the complexity and the "irrationality" of reality, scientists have to select the historical material according to some specific values that help to determine the focal elements in the infinity of history: "We therefore substitute the infinite world of sensitive things with a finite universe of meaningful individualities (persons, actions or objects). Values have the same function as laws in natural science but in a different way. They allow one to distinguish between the essential and the secondary, the important and the meaningless" (Aron 1969, 120, our translation). In this sense the ideal-type method is a specific application of the value-relevance approach: the point is to emphasize some elements seen as essential considering the phenomena analyzed. Beyond its instrumental dimension, the key point is that the ideal-type approach means the recognition of the contingent character of any theoretical concept relative to the specificity of the phenomena studied:12 the greater the event to which we conceptualize complicated historical developments with respect to those components in which their specific</page><page sequence="13">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 179 cultural significance is contained, the greater the extent to which the concept - or system of concepts - will be ideal-typical in character. The goal of ideal-typical concept-construction is always to make clearly explicit not the class or average character but rather the unique individual character of cultural phenomena. (Weber [1904] 1949, 101). Both Veblen and Weber through their analyses of the rationalization process developed a similar idea: the perception of a given phenomenon (the rationalization process in this particular case) takes place through an evolutionary theoretical framework which is specific in two ways, relative namely to the phenomenon studied and to the context in which it is studied. The second element, which we call the "theorization of history" is perhaps more evident. The works of Weber and Veblen aimed at explaining the process through which modern economies and societies emerged. For both of them, rationalization is one of the main explanatory principles of the historical evolution that results in the emergence of modern capitalism, while this rationalization process is at the same time itself causally explained. The Theory of Action and the Status of the Concept of Rationality The first explanation of the divergences between the respective analyses of Weber and Veblen can be found in the treatment of the rationality concept by these authors (Kilpinen 2004). This divergence itself originates from the respective philosophical backgrounds of the two authors and leads to two different theories of action. This explains why rationalization in Veblen's work appears to be a substantive and objective process, while in the writings of Weber it is rather a formal and subjective process. Weber's position on the rationality hypothesis that can be found in the marginalist theory is well-known: the law of marginal utility (the "Weber-Fechner law") does not need a psychological basis because it is only a particular application of the ideal-type method. Put differently, the marginalist theory relies on the idealization of the action of individuals with a perspective of a goal-oriented action rationality and therefore does not have to be supported by any psychological argument. The idealization of goal-oriented rational activity is methodologically justified by the fact that it is the most directly understandable: "it is only the relation of an ideal-typical concept which is developed to facilitate an empirically valid interpretation in the following way: the given facts are compared with a possible interpretation - an interpretative scheme" (Weber [1903-06] 1975, 189). It means the marginal utility theory framework is valid13 independently of any psychological consideration. To say this is not to deny any form of relevance of psychology, but it refutes any kind of psychological reductionism. This epistemological position characterizes more generally the typology of the different forms of social activity that Weber developed in Economy and Society (Weber [1922] 1978, 24-26). Weber distinguished four ideal-typical forms of social action:</page><page sequence="14">180 Cyril Hedoin effectual action, traditional action, value-oriented rational action and goal-oriented rational action. This classification has to be interpreted as a graduation in the reflexivity of the thinking of individuals relative to the material and idealistic interests that guide their actions. Therefore, while the first two forms correspond to quasi meaningless actions, the two rational actions come from individuals who are able to consciously give a meaning to the values that guide their actions. In Kantian logic, Weber's action theory is therefore founded in part on a priori thinking. In this construction, because it is the most meaningful, the goal-oriented rational action holds a heuristically privileged place.14 Using this typology, which presupposes a logic of evolution, Weber tried to understand the real dynamics of the rationalization process. The increase of rationality is thus studied by way of a comparison with a standard of measurement not empirically but a priori founded, therefore rejecting the idea of a rationality being constructed through the interactions between individuals and their material conditions of life. Hence, if rationality in Weber's works is actually a historical concept, it is in this particular sense that "real" human actions tend to approach the goaloriented rational action idealtype more and more, Veblen's point of view concerning the rationality concept becomes evident in two of his major articles, "Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science ?" (1898) and "The Limitations of Marginal Utility" (1909). It is precisely with psychological arguments that Veblen rejected the marginal utility theory. The main point of Veblen's criticism is that the marginalist theory sees the individual not as an agent but as a receptacle of essentially economic impulses and stimuli. Veblen argued that this passive conception of human nature is contradicted by works in psychology and anthropology, and that it wrongly focuses only on the determinants of human action, not on the action itself. An important point is that this criticism can be applied to Weber's own conception of rationality. In fact, despite taking into account different motives leading the individual to act, it is only focusing on the determinants of action: "The ground for this Veblenian conclusion is that marginal utility theory, its supposed antithesis in deontological moral philosophy, and their supposed mediator in Weber's economic sociology, all commit the same early nineteenth century error: they talk exclusively about determinants of action, instead of action proper, and presume that the problem of action is thereby over and done with" (Kilpinen 2004, 422). The key point is that without being radically opposed to Weber's conception of human rationality (which seems to be conceptualized through only one dimension: the degree of reflexivity of individuals relative to their values), it appears that Veblen's conception is developed in a larger perspective (Kilpinen 2004). Put differently, if according to Utilitarianism, calculative rationality really exists, it's only a particular dimension of human behavior. Building his action theory on pragmatist philosophy,15 Veblen argued that action is a circular process without clearly separable determinants: he used the typically pragmatist idea that the essence of action is habit, a mix of intention and habituation. A habit is at the same time the cause and the consequence of action. In other words, the individual builds up his own rationality in a constant interaction with his environment and this rationality cannot be reduced to its</page><page sequence="15">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 181 calculative form but also has an habitual form. This means that for Veblen, habitual action (the action resulting from individuals habits) was itself a part of rational behavior, while Weber considered it to be characterized by a smaller degree of rationality. Veblenian rationality is therefore synonymous with human action in a pragmatist sense: the individual develops and follows habits and beliefs within the framework of his action and in order to act. The action is conceived in a synchronic way, which means that the ends-means relation, which is very important in Weber's work, lost part of its meaning in Veblen's work. Consequently, in the Veblenian perspective, rationalization manifests itself not in the procedure of choice of ends or means but in the propensity of the behavior of individuals to adapt themselves to the environment. Thus it becomes easier to understand why Veblen made technology a major factor in shaping individuals' habits of thought and in the rationalization process: it is only through a constant relation between the "biological matrix" and the "cultural matrix" (Renault 1992) that human nature builds itself up and that a movement of rationalization can follow. If there is rationalization of individuals' habits of thought, it must be through never-ending interactions with the environment. Neo-Kantian Historicism versus Darwinian and Pragmatist Evolutionism Though we think that the double movement of the historicization of theory and the theorization of history is common to the works of Veblen and Weber, there are clearly basic differences in their approaches, of which the divergences in the analysis of the rationalization process constitute only one aspect. We argue here that some of these divergences come from the respective epistemological foundations on which the two authors build their work, without being fully incompatible. A comparison between the philosophical and epistemological principles of Neo-Kantianism and Pragmatism can help us to have a better understanding of the differences between the respective analyses process of Weber and Veblen of the Western rationalization process.16 In the philosophical field, the starting point of both authors is the same (Kilpinen 2004): the tension between the traditional Kantian philosophy and the insights obtained by the (at that time) new evolutionary points of view that emerged at the end of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth century. WHiile the Kantian inspiration of Weber is obvious, Veblen's first scientific writings were on Kantian philosophy. WTiile Weber, because of the influence of the dominating continental idealist philosophy of the late nineteenth century, always stayed close to this Kantian inspiration, Veblen was influenced by the Pragmatist philosophy, a typically American philosophy. Pragmatism, which is radically anti cartesian tries to incorporate the philosophical insights of Darwinism and is often presented as a field of thought making an arbitration between Kantian and Hegelian idealism and British empiricism. Economically speaking, it means that Pragmatism is halfway between Historicist idealism and Marxist materialism (Hodgson 2001, 489). This philosophical divergence has several repercussions, first on the methodological</page><page sequence="16">182 Cyril Hedoin level strictly speaking, and more generally on the way natural and social phenomena are analyzed. Like some historicist authors such as Schmoller and Sombart and in an idealist perspective, Weber mainly focused on the cultural determinants in the wide sense of social and economic phenomena. The importance that Weber gave to the economic ethics of various religions in the rationalization process is an example of this focus. Moreover, as it has been argued above, the Kantian perspective led Weber to create some a priori categories of action comprising in themselves the logic of a rationalization process. In other words, his epistemology made him develop a theory of action that presupposes the very possibility of a movement of rationalization. This point gives at least a partial explanation why the Weberian analysis of religion mainly consists in emphasizing factors that have allowed, or on the contrary prevented, the effective realization of this process. Since rationalization is defined as a detachment of individuals from their values, it is therefore not surprising that Weber mainly located the dynamics of the evolution of this process on the level of "ideas." The first consequence of Veblen's adoption of pragmatist principles is the rejection of the ontological and methodological dualisms that characterize Kantian philosophy. The Pragmatist philosophy, which is the product of both the Darwinian revolution and the development of experimental sciences, can in fact be characterized as a criticism of various philosophies of idealism, which in some way or another postulate a separation of mind and body. While Weber (1904) reaffirmed the demarcation between natural sciences and cultural sciences, Veblen implicitly introduced the idea of both a methodological and ontological continuity between the natural and the social realms. On a methodological level, there is no trace in Veblen's writings of the idea that social sciences should develop a method different from that of natural sciences. Quite the contrary, his writings on the evolution of science (Veblen 1906 and 1908) or his epistemological works (Veblen 1898) put economics on the same level as the natural sciences. In this sense, Veblen clearly followed Peirce who has never thought it necessary to develop specific considerations for social sciences, despite having a good knowledge of the economic theory of his time.17 The Pragmatist model of scientific inquiry, mainly characterized by the connection of three logical inferences (abduction, deduction, induction) is applicable for all sciences. This methodological continuity is itself generated by an ontological continuity. Strongly influenced by the rapidly growing experimental sciences at the end of the nineteenth century, the pragmatist philosophy considers that the scientific method invariably starts from a basic - ontological - postulate: There are real things, whose characters are entirely independent of our opinions about them; those realities affect our senses according to regular laws, and, though our sensations are as different as are our relations to the objects, yet, by taking advantage of the laws of perception, we can ascertain by reasoning how things really are; and any man, if he have sufficient experience and reason enough about it, will be led to the one true conclusion. (Peirce 1877 384)</page><page sequence="17">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 183 Pragmatism therefore relies on an ontological realism that creates a continuity between "the mechanic and the organic" (Kilpinen 1999). The last key characteristic of Pragmatism is the development of an isomorphism between knowledge theory and action theory: the main features of scientific inquiry (continuity between nature and culture; key role of the abductive inference; importance of habits and beliefs) can be extended to human behavior in general. In the pragmatist perspective of Peirce, Dewey or Mead, the individual is viewed through an activist conception of the human mind and as relying permanently on habits allowing him to act in an inherently ontologically uncertain world. In the ontological field, Veblen developed a theory of economic behavior that creates a link between the natural world (instincts), the social world (institutions) and the material environment (technology) through the concept of habit, present already in the works of all Pragmatist philosophers, from Peirce and James to Dewey. A habit is a behavioral predisposition, i.e., a propensity to adopt some specific behavior (Hodgson 2001; 2004). In the Veblenian framework, habits allow individuals to adapt themselves to their environment and therefore satisfy their instincts. Moreover, habits produce behaviors whose agregation modifies the institutional environment (through the variation and selection of the existing institutions). In the opposite direction, there is a "reconstitutive downward causation" (Hodgson 2004) in which technology, through a selection of institutions, modifies individuals habits of thought. This framework makes it possible for Veblen to give an interpretation of the rationalization process. Conclusion In this paper we have tried to compare the analysis of the rationalization process made by two authors in the early twentieth century, Max Weber and Thorstein Veblen. The aim was both informative and historical: Veblen and Weber had two similar profiles and wrote at the same epoch on one common topic among others, the rationalization process. Therefore, it is interesting to underline the convergences and divergences of their respective analyses on this subject. From this point of view, though Weber and Veblen's analyses have strong similarities on a formal ground, their contents clearly diverge on many points. In large part, this divergence seems to originate from their two different theories of actions. Finally, it is on the level of knowledge theories and more generally of the respective philosophical foundations of Historicism and Institutionalism that many of the differences can be explained. Our story may also serve to start a reflection on the identity of an Institutionalist tradition in the social sciences. Although Veblen and Weber came from two different cultural and philosophical traditions, and if it is true that their respective analyses have great divergences, it nevertheless appears that their interests and problematics are similar: the institutions and their evolution. In this regard, the comparative study of Neo-Kantian and Pragmatist principles has to be intensified, notably because these philosophies have structured numerous works that can be integrated into an "institutionalist tradition" in opposition to the mainstream's positivism.</page><page sequence="18">184 Qf^ Hed?in Notes 1. We will not tackle the question here whether it is relevant or not to consider Weber as a member of the German Historical School of Economics. We also do not contend that it is possible to let Veblen and Weber belong to the same school of thought, a claim that seems senseless. Nevertheless, this work is part of a more global study that looks for some common principles in the history of the economic and sociological thought characterizing what we can call the institutionalist tradition or historical institutionalism (Bazzoli and Dutraive 2005). 2. There have recently been many developments on Veblen's theory of preconceptions aiming at clarifying its real meaning and implications (see for example Lawson 2002 and Samuels 1990). Geoffrey M. Hodgson (2004, Chap. X) points out the philosophical necessity that induced Veblen to develop this theory while underlining its problems. 3. "This ultimate term or ground of knowledge is always of a metaphysical character. It is something in the way of a preconception, accepted uncritically, but applied in criticism and demonstration of all else with which the science is concerned. So soon as it comes to be criticised, it is in a way to be superseded by a new, more or less altered formulation; for criticism of it means that it is no longer fit to survive unaltered in the altered complex of habits of thought to which it is called upon to serve as fundamental principle. It is subject to natural selection and selective adaptation, as are other conventions" (Veblen 1900: 149). 4. A point can be made here on the pragmatist foundations of Veblen's works (see Veblen 1906, for an explicit statement concerning the links between his work and the pragmatist tradition): the animistic type of knowledge seems to correspond more or less to three of the four types of knowledge identified by the pragmatist philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce (Peirce 1877 see also Tiercelin 1993): the method of tenacity, the a priori method and the method of authority. Veblen's second type of knowledge (i.e., the matter-of-fact knowledge) is very close to Peirce's scientific method. 5. On Weber's Neo-Kantian thesis of the incommensurability of the realm of values and the empirical realm: the empirical disciplines "are concerned only with the fact that the validity of a practical imperative as a norm and the truth-values of an empirical proposition are absolutely heterogeneous in character. Any attempt to treat these logically different types of propositions as identical only reduces the particular of each of them" (Weber 1917, 12). 6. We can note, however, that Weber's rationality concept also has an analytical dimension through the typology of social activities. There is therefore in the Weberian analysis of rationalization a duality between, on the one hand, a logic of evolution which is the logical consequence of the typology of social activities and describes a "progression" from a non-rational logic of action to a rational one, and, on the other hand, the description of a dynamic of evolution that shows the way the rationalization process was actually carried out or not (Raynaud 1996). 7. We can note that Veblen rarely used the term "capitalism" in comparison with the German scholars like Weber or Sombart. William Dugger (2006) believes that Veblen rejected this word because he didn't consider capitalism to be a stable and coherent system, and thus it was not appropriate to designate it by a precise concept that would suggest the reverse. This leads us to an interesting point: while Weber made capitalism the definitive result of the rationalization process, Veblen seemed to consider that this same process will lead to something beyond the capitalist system, whose stabilization was unlikely to take place. 8. Veblen (1914, Chap. VI and VII) considers that capitalism emerged during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, i.e., during the handicraft era. 9. "[I]n the course of the transition to modern times and modern ways of thinking the principle of efficient cause gradually replaced that of sufficient reason, as the final ground of certitude in conclusions of a theoretical nature" (Veblen 11914J 2006, 323). 10. Vandenberghe (1997) considers that the Weberian formal rationalization is similar to the Marxist concept of reification: "Although the concept of reification mainly concerns the domination of men by things while Weber's formal rationalization, as it appears in his theory of bureaucratic domination, emphasizes in a Nietzchean fashion the domination of men by men, the Marxist criticism of capitalism and the Weberian criticism of modernity share an insistence on the importance of autonomy and on rationalization's alienating effects," (Vandenberghe 1997, 164-165, our translation).</page><page sequence="19">Weber and Veblen on the Rationalization Process 185 For the same author, the pessimism of Weber concerning this process is obvious: "Weber conceives history as a 'pendular movement' in which the development of formal rationality is temporarily undermined by the emergence of charismatic manifestations that first transform men's spirit and then are standardized until a new charismatic movement appears. However, it seems that in the long run the never-ending fight between the creative charisma of history and the rationalizing bureaucracy must turn to the advantage of the latter" (167, our translation). 11. Weber's analysis of socialism found in his political writings (for example, Weber [1918] 2004) or in the second chapter of Economy and Society (Weber [1922] 1978) makes a case for this point: Weber argues that a socialist system is not a remedy to the reification generated by the rationalization process. Quite the contrary, such a system, in amalgamating political and economic bureaucracies, will strengthen the iron cage. Indeed, in addition to the problems created by the absence of price in terms of formal rationality, there still will be a separation between the working force and their means of production. Moreover, with the possible disappearance of entrepreneurial activity, the system would lose its dynamic capacity. A socialist system would therefore be dominated by a perpetual struggle between conflicting lobbies. See also Swedberg (1998, Chap. 3). 12. It is important to note that the question of the historicization of theory includes but is also more general than the problem of historical specificity (Hodgson 2001). Both Weber and Veblen clearly wanted to emphasize the specific character of each historical phenomenon and therefore develop the idea that any given theory is not able to grasp all phenomena. But the problem of the historicization of theory is more than that because it questions the way concepts and theories are constructed according to the specificity of the object and also to the context in which this object is studied. 13. It is important to note that the fact that the marginalist framework is valid doesn't necessarily imply that it's heuristically relevant. As all ideal-types, the marginalist theory relies on conceptions that deform and idealize reality. Therefore, there is no direct correspondence between concept and reality. However, contrary to the neoclassical's instrumentalism, Weber's ideal-type method is attentive to the fact that the relevance of an ideal-type is never guaranteed and is contingent upon the phenomena that the scientist analyzes. Consequently, while it is not inherently wrong to use marginal utility theory in analyzing primitive societies, it may have little relevance heuristically speaking. The scientist has to replace or switch the ideal-type he uses with a new one in order to have a better reading of the phenomena he studies. Flexibility of this kind in the analytical corpus is clearly not found in mainstream economic theory. 14. For example: "For the purpose of a typological scientific analysis it is convenient to treat all irrational, effectually determined elements of behavior as factors of deviation from a conceptually pure type of rational action (...). The construction of a purely rational course of action in such case serves the sociologist as a type (ideal type) which has the merit of clear understandability and lack of ambiguity. By comparison with this it is possible to understand the ways in which actual action is influenced by irrational factors of all sorts, such as affects and errors, in that they account for the deviation from the line of conduct which would be expected on the hypothesis that the action were purely rational" (Weber [1922] 1978, 6). 15. Kilpinen (2003; 2004) considers that Veblen was strongly influenced by the work of Mead and especially Dewey. The latter develops his conception of action in an article "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" (Dewey 1896) and in his book Human Nature and Conduct (Dewey [1922] 2002). In these works, action is conceived as a unified process in which it is not possible to isolate one particular step. Therefore, Dewey criticized the postulation of a separation between the stimuli (the determinant of action) and the movement (the action proper) of the "arc conception." Quite the contrary, action looks like a circle in which the stimuli precedes the movement as well as the reverse. 16. Beyond the comparison of the analyses of Weber and Veblen, the confrontation between these two philosophical traditions could be useful as part of a broader study of the relations between what can be seen as two branches of a large institutionalist tradition, represented by the German Historical School and the American Institutionalism (Joas 1995). This is true although it could be denied that Weber was a member of the Historical School strictly speaking. This question of the nature of the relations between Weber and this school of thought also calls for careful analysis. 17. See Kilpinen (2004), who affirms that Peirce even had a good opinion of the marginalist theory and mathematical economics in general.</page><page sequence="20">186 Cyril Hedoin References Aron, Raymond.
