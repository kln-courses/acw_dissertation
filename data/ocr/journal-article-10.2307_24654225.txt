<plain_text><page sequence="1">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel DAVID FARRELL KRELL Plato's Timeaus is a feast of discourse on man and the world, a banquet sponsored by Socrates' friends, whom he has entertained the previous day with a celebration of justice in the city. It takes place on the day of Pallas Athena's festival (cf. 20 c.). Socrates asks after a member of the pre vious day's group who today is missing; Timaeus explains that he has been taken ill. Perhaps it is not too fanciful to suggest that philoso phers from Aristotle to Alfred North Whitehead, and beyond, have volunteered to serve as the mysterious fourth at the Timaeus-feast. Eugen Fink is one of these.1 'Born in 1905 at Constance, Professor Fink studied with and assisted both Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Until his recent retirement, he was Professor of Philoso phy at the University of Freidburg. Among his published books are: Studien zur Phäno menologie 1930-1939 (The Hague: M.

Duquesne University Press expects to publish soon an English translation of Fink's Spie! als Weltsymbol.</page><page sequence="2">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel Play is both a cosmic symbol and a symbol of the cosmos: Professor Fink's study of Spiel simultaneously pursues hermeneutics and ontol ogy. In the final chapter of his Spiel als Weltsymbol, Fink offers the following thesis-statement: "Human play is a particularly outstanding way in which Dasein understandingly comports itself to the totality of that which is, and which lets itself be penetrated by that totality. In the play of men the world-totality shines back into itself, and lets infinity shimmer on and in an intramun dane and finite entity.2 It is possible for men to play, and it is possible for them to experience the world. These possibilities must be thought together: "An ekstasis of human existence (Dasein) eventuates (ereignet sich) in human play" (Sp, 231). "Because we are open to the world, and be cause a knowledge of the groundlessness of the ruling totality is in volved in this openness of Dasein to the world, can we play at all; be cause he is 'worldly,' man is a player" (Sp, 239). In order to open these brief formulations and give our understanding of Professor Fink's project more play-space, we offer five sections of exposition: (1) major sources for the project, (2) a consideration of child's play, (3) ritual or cult-play, (4) world play, and (5) the play of thought. I. Sources A. Heraclitus ofEphesus The fifty-second fragment of Heraclitus (Diels) reads: A ion pais esti paizon, pesseuon. Paidos e basileie. "Aion is a child playing at draughts; kingship is the child's." Aion means cosmic time, the course of the world through time.3 "The totality of being, and indeed the rul ing world, is addressed in the symbolic likeness of the 'playing child,' pais paizon. The most primordial bringing-forth has the character of play. The world rules—as play" (Sp, 28-9). The child at play is a name 1Spiel als Weltsymbol (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1960), p. 230, hereinafter referred to as "Sp". 'Cf.

He avoids the technical model, which builds the world out of elemental pieces according to a blueprint, in order to win a more profound insight into the ontolotical significance of fire, i.e. its way of pro-ducing intramundane entities: If we should succeed at thinking back behind the usual schematics of making, producing and illuminating, or making visible, then we might understand the rising of the day in a deeper sense. We could then say: in the rising of the day the fundamental distinction of various world-regions (the sea, the earth, the atmosphere) first of all comes into prominence (H, 134). In this "day-ing of the world" man plays a conspicuous role. Man "exists essentially as a relation to Being, to the totality"(H. 144). Since that relation remains for the most part dormant, even stagnant, one needs the companionship of mighty thinkers to awaken thought on it. "Perhaps in conversation with the thinker Heraclitus we can come to such an experience in which the totality, towards which we unawares always comport ourselves, flashes into view" (H. 144). For Fink, the child at play can best be approached through the references to fire: for Heidegger, the meaning of cosmic fire becomes accessible only through the references to logos (H,179-180). In either case, logos is inseparable from physis: logos lets lie before thought that which comes to presence in the world: logos gathers and sorts, stores and safeguards the vintage of Being.5 Perhaps the playing child, who can JCf.

Fragment 52, concerning Aion, never becomes a theme for the Heraclitus seminar of Heidegger and Fink; yet, every issue discussed there (the relation of the one to all things, the problem of hermeneutics, the problem of death, etc.) requires con sideration of the child at play. Fragment 52 is thus the shadow of the philosophers' inquiry, being present yet absent. 5Cf. Heidegger, Vorträge und Aufsätze, 3rd ed., vol.

His thoughts are indeed "the playthings of children" (fr. 70). Heraclitus is the earliest and most fundamental source of Fink's inquiry into the cosmic symbolism of the play. Yet it is the present situation of philosophy that requires and enables such an inquiry. At the close of the "Heraclitus Seminar," Fink remarks, "Only as nihilists can we speak with the Greeks" (H. 259). Although adding the qualification that nihilism is not a "finished program" for contem porary thought, Fink suggests that only in recent times has the horizon been clear and the sea open for an encounter with the Greeks. Metaphysical philosophy has for a long time covered the horizon and sea—man's relation to the world—with rainbow bridges to the divine. "The theological character of metaphysics has continuously obscured and obfuscated man's relation to the world" (Sp. 25). Fink wishes to "think back to Heraclitus,"a pre-theological thinker, in order to win a perspective on the illumination of the world (pur)and the course of the cosmos (pais paizon). Such a perspective can be won only by a reflection which recognizes the reciprocal relation of human play and world play: "In order to understand play, we have to know the world; and in order to understand the world as play, we have to win a much more profound insight into the world" (Sp, 62). With Heraclitus' thought on cosmic fire, sun, lightning, logos, and the playing child, Play becomes a 'cosmic metaphor' for the collective appearance and disappearance of things in the space and time of the world. The foaming and frenzied flood of life, which instills in living beings the desire to reproduce, is secretly one with the dark wave which tears living things away into death. Life and death, birth and dying, womb and tomb, are sisters, one to another: the same propelling power of the totality produces and annihilates, creates and kills, uniting the highest desire and the deepest suffering(Sp. 62).

And how has the relation of man to the world-totality once more become a theme for investigation? B. Nietzsche From his overturning of the Platonistic valuation of Being and Becoming, Nietzsche achieves "a new experience of Being."7 But this achievement results from his study of early Greek philosophy and tragedy, and especially of Heraclitus. "His struggle begins with the Eleatics and Plato, and with the metaphysical tradition which stems from them. Heraclitus remains the originary root of Nietzsche's philosophy." (N. 13). After 2500 years, an attempt is made to re-think Heraclitus' philosophy of cosmic play: it is a new way and an anci ent way, running counter to the predominate way of the metaphysical tradition. In his autobiography, Ecco Homo, Nietzsche acknowledges his kinship with the First tragic philosopher: Before me, this transformation of the Dionysian into a philosophical pathos does not occur: tragic wisdom is lacking—I have looked in vain for traces of it in the great Greek philosophers two centuries before Socrates. A doubt remains when it comes to Heraclitus, in whose company I feel altogether warmer and better than anywhere else. The affirmation of passing-away and annihilating, the decisive move towards a Dionysian philosophy, the yea-saying to contrariety and struggle, becoming, with a radical aversion to the very concept of 'Being'—in light of these I must acknowledge his thought as closest to mine of all previous thought.8 Such recognition is present already in his essay, "Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks" (1873), based on lectures in Pre-Socratic philosophy at tne University of Basel: A becoming and passing-away, a building and destroying devoid of every moralistic calculation, in an innocence eternally the same (in ewig gleicher Unschuld), 'Fink, Nielzches Philosophie (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 2nd ed., 1968), p. 13; cf. pp. 179ff.

And as the child and the artist play, so plays the ever-living Fire, building up and tearing down in innocence; and this game Aion plays with himself.9 Perhaps the most fruitful approach to Nietzsche's fundamental conception, the ewige Wiederkunft des Gleichen, would be a reflection on this ewig gleicher Unschuld of Becoming: to sustain a reflection on the Eternal Recurrence of the Same requires that thought re lease the world from certain categorial demands—"category" originally means "accusation"—and celebrate the eternity of time, who eats her children in innocence. This releasement is what Nietzsche awaited at Sils-Maria, the birthplace of his idea: Here I sat, waiting, waiting,—for nothing, Beyond good and evil; now the light enjoying, Now the shadow; everything was play, Everything sea, midday, time with no goal in its way. Then suddenly, sweet friend, one became duality, —And Zarathustra walked in front of me.10 "In Heraclitus' conception of play," Fink writes, "Nietzsche Finds his deepest intuition of the reality of the world as grandiose cos mic metaphor" (N, 41). The metaphor has the disclosing power of Fire or logos itself, exhibiting the world-totality as the play of innocence and necessity. "Being-in-totality, the world, is a play" (N, 30). With such a metaphor, Nietzsche insists, Heraclitus draws the cur tain on "the greatest theater-piece" in which man and world are brought to play. But this logos, metaphor, is itself play, artistic play. Does Nietzsche merely unconsciously project his own and Heraclitus' play on to the world—as though the world were an empty canvas or a blank screen? In a book entitled Aion, Carl Jung gives us to reflect on the danger of such unconscious projections, which he likens to auto erotic and even autistic conditions." But Nietzsche's "projection" is "Schlechta, 111, 376; quoted by Fink, N, 40-41. '"Schlechta, II, 271: "Hier sass ich, wartend, wartend—doch auf nichts,/Jenseits von Gut und Böse, bald des Lichts/Geniessend, bald des Schattens, ganz nur Spiel,/Ganz See, ganz Mittag, ganz Zeit ohne Ziel./Da, plötzlich, Freundin! wurde eins zu zwei—/ —Und Zarathustra ging an mir vorbei...

It is with the self-awareness appropriate to Socratis irony that Nietzsche speaks of artistic play and world-play. Since that self-awareness is nothing else than ignorance, however, Nietzsche's thought, like Plato's, forever smiles to itself as it plays. "In truth, human artistic activity is a played play, ein gespieltes Spiel in which we are only figures and images, ourselves belonging to appearance, Schein."12 Whether the mixture of knowledge and ig norance, truth and illusion, confidence and shame, which play is, can be suited to philosophical thinking (or vice-versa), is the first and last question for Fink. (We will try to speak to it in the final section of the paper.) Not only irony, however, but also tragedy, characterizes the artistic play which responds to world-play. This is the theme of The Birth of Tragedy, where Nietzsche describes the Widerspiel or counter-play of Apollo and Dionysus in tragic art. (N. 17-18). The tragic pathos of ancient Greece affirms in dramatic play the emergence and descent of all individual beings in the world-totality: mourning does not degenerate into resentment and demands for redemption. "In a tragic view of the world there can be no redemption" (N. 26). The only world "beyond" is this world, the one world, "beyond good and evil." For anyone born during the waning of the Christian era, the way back to this one world involves a series of startling transformations. In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche describes the advance (which works its way back to Heraclitus) as the metamorphosis of camel to lion, and lion to child. The camel bears the load of responsibility for good and evil, wisdom and ignorance; he suffers a longing for infinite transcen dance, and carries kings in search of a savior. In the wasteland of passive nihilism the camel is stirred to rebellion, throws off the burden |;N, 25. Jean Granier's excellent work has elaborated Fink's argument by showing that any approach to a Nietzschean "ontology" must recognize his fundamental experi ence of "the duplicity of Being," according to which man is forever caught in the Diony sian jeu or play of truth and illusion. Granier writes: "Le jeu résume les intuitions les plus subtiles qui s'attachaient à la compréhension de l'Etre comme Etre-interprété: à savior, que l'Etre est affranchi de toutes les restrictions trop humaines, qu'il est au delà de la valeur, au-delà de l'utilité, au-delà de la logique, au-delà des antinomies rigides dans lesquelles se verrouille l'entendement humain. L'Etre est le jeu de l'enfant Dionysus, le jeu de l'Etre exprime ce qu'il y a de plus libre, de plus joyeux, de plus innocent."

While the lion's "I will" has replaced the camel's "Thou shalt," the battle of wills imprisons him. Only when the lion's willing has become truly free and creative does he assume the form of Aion, the child at play: The child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a play, a wheel rolling of itself, a first movement, a holy yea-saying. Yes, my brothers, a holy affirmation is necessary for the play of creation: the spirit wants his will, and those who have lost a world gain his world.13 The thinking of Eternal Recurrence, which climbs high beyond all previous forms of Will to Power (N, 85), searches for a play which will illuminate the world in its innocence,and for an openness to the world as it is (N, 93). "Where the world, which gives space and lets time be, opens itself to thinking, the phantom realm of the supersensuous 'Beyond' dissolves, the moral and metaphysical interpretation of being collapses" (N, 90). It is Dionysus who answers Nietzsche's wait ing at Sils-Maria, and opens the world to his thinking: Dionysus the gift-giver and destroyer, the god of wine, the patron of all play, the god whom Heraclitus identifies with Hades, and the god of masks whom the city cannot imprison. Will to Power is not so much aban doned as transformed: "Dionysus is the unity of Will to Power, as the Apollonian tendency, and of Eternal Recurrence as the Dionysian depths of time [Zeittiefe] in all finite things. . . . Only when Dionysus is interpreted as the god of play can the divine play of the world, in the open space between heaven and earth, be essentially understood" (N, 176). The final chapter of Fink's work on Nietzsche, which may as a whole be fairly described as a response to Heidegger's two-volume Nietzsche, bears the title, "Nietzsche's Relation to Metaphysics as Im prisonment and Liberation."14 It searches for that "new experience of Being" which should mark Nietzsche's philosophy as an epochal event in western thought, as both the end of metaphysical philosophy and "Schlechta, 11, 294; quoted by Fink, N, 71.

"But does Nietzsche really find a new Grund, or does he in his war against metaphysics remain de pendent on metaphysics?" (N, 181). Fink answers that, so long as Nietzsche's thought revolves about the axis of valuative thinking [Wertdenken] as it does, for the most part, in his conceptions of Re valuation of all Values, Overman, and Will to Power, Nietzsche re mains imprisoned in the confines of the traditional metaphysical Leitfrage. But his intuition of being-in-totality as Spiel, expressed in his fundamental conceptions of Dionysus and the Eternal Recurrence of the Same, signifies liberation from the tradition. The play of the creative Overman, the artist in the grand style, in sympathy with the play of the innocent world, pais paizon, is Nietzsche's essential insight into man in the universe. The essence of man can be founded and determined only as Spiel, if man is thought out of his ecstatic openness to the ruling world. . . . The world plays, plays as the Dionysian ground which brings forth the Apollonian world of appearance . . . beyond good and evil, beyond all valuation, precisely because all values emerge within this play . . . Where Nietzsche grasps Being and Becoming as Spiel, he no longer stands in the confine ment of metaphysics. (N, 188.) Dionysus, the spirit of music, inspires Nietzsche's "bird-like wisdom," and prompts him, "Sing! Speak no more!" To Goethe's "Alles vergängliche is nur ein Gleichnis," Nietzsche's Prince Freebird rejoins: World play, the ruling, Mixes Being and Mere Appearance: This eternal fooling Mixes us in the performance!15 C. Heidegger In paragraph 70 of Being and Time, "The Temporality of the Spatiality Appropriate to Dasein," Martin Heidegger distinguishes Dasein's spatiality from that of beings present-to-hand in the world.

Dasein does not simply take up space, it takes in space: it moves understanding^ through the world, amid tools, trees and people, always finding space for its play. "Existierend hat es je schon einen Spielraum eingeräumt."16 Dasein's play-space (or "leeway") is characterized by directionality and undistancing (or "desevering").17 But does the term Spielraum in Heidegger's analytic of Dasein refer in a special way to human playl The interpretation of Dasein's average everydayness from the point of view of the workaday Zeug or equipment, as well as the interpretation of Dasein's total Being as Sorge or care, whose most fundamental mood is anxiety, seem to deny play a place among the existential structures of Dasein. Indeed, among the concrete descriptions of concern, of directionality and undistancing, of the public self, of mood, understanding and speech, play is conspicuous by its absence. Nevertheless, Fink looks upon his own work concerning play as an elaboration of Heidegger's "In-der-Welt-sein," referring to Being and Time as Heidegger's "great breakthrough work" (Sp, 47). Play is an aspect of Being-in-the world as such, and therefore ought to admit of analysis in terms of concern and care, of Being-with, and even of anxiety-disclosure. Play, perhaps, is another way of breaking the hammer: play removes Dasein from its everyday preoccupations, and proves to be a particularly disclosive type of concern; as in the experience of anxiety, in play Dasein's flight towards things ready-at-hand ceases, and Dasein is brought before its being-free to choose itself as Being-in the-world!8 During the 1950's, Heidegger conducted a search into the principle of Ground or Sufficient Reason. Metaphysics, whose structure is onto-theological, names God as the primary ground, prote arche, of beings.19 For Leibniz, the ratio sufficiens of beings is accessible only to the summa ratio, the highest type of thought, which means to say, mathematical calculation.

A detailed comparison of play and Angst cannot be offered here, although it might prove most surprising—what should play have to do with being anxious?—and significant. "Cf.

Man, by the grace of God, has reason in mind and heart, while things and events have their reasons behind them. Accordingly, philosophical ratio is calculative re-flection, Spirit bending back and catching up with its own handiwork, namely, the being-ness of beings. Heidegger elsewhere utters the curious remark that before such a God man cannot make music and dance.21 His com plaint is reminiscent of Zarathustra's opposition to the Spirit of Gravi ty (in the talk entitled, "Reading and Writing"), and his prolonged search for "a god who could dance."22 Playing music and dancing be fore God suggest a relation between the human and divine regions far different from lingua rationalis of Leibniz. On the two-hundredth birthday of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, which happened to fall dur ing Heidegger's lecture course on the Principle of Ground, Heidegger quoted a selection from one of Mozart's letters. The passage has to do with creative inspiration, with those times when Mozart hears the music has not yet written. "The thoughts stream towards me some times best when I'm traveling in a carriage, or after a fine meal, or while I'm strolling, and in the night when I can't sleep. . . ,'23 During these periods of release from his workaday world, Mozart hears some thing in the quiet. In order to describe Mozart's hearkening, Heideg ger quotes Angelus Silesius: God's Lute-Play A heart, rapt to the God our Ground, as He wills, Will happily be stirred by Him: the heart is His lute-play. Heidegger remarks: "'God's lute-play.' That is Mozart."24 "Quoted in Heidegger, Satz vom Grund, pp. 169-70; cf. Leibniz Selections, ed. Philip Wiener (C.

It plays upon a simple shift of emphasis in the traditional formula of sufficient reason, from "Nichts ist ohne Grund," "Nothing is without Ground," which is the negation of all negation, to "Nichts ist ohne Grund," "Nothing is without Ground," which is the affirmation of the Nihil out of which beings emerge and into which they descend. In conformity to this new affirmation, Heidegger attempts a new translation of Leibniz' phrase, "Cum Deus calculât fit mundus." It reads: As God plays, the world comes to be. The simple shift of emphasis in Leibniz' principle of sufficient reason, and the rather daring reconstruction of his marginal note, refer us back to Nietzsche and Heraclitus. Heidegger's search into the Principle of Ground closes with a reference to Aion, which is a name for logos as well as physis and cosmos, and thus a call for a hermeneutical ontology.25 The child who plays rules the world and determines how we come to question the cosmos. The child at play is the Seinsgeschick, the fateful sending of Being. Why does he play? "The 'because' gets submerged in the play; play is without a 'why.' It plays inasmuch as it plays. It remains only play: the highest and deepest."26 To inquire into the principle of sufficient reason requires that we listen to the language of this play and so put ourselves in play. We put ourselves in play when we pose questions about mortality. Can the essence of play be appropriately determined out of Being as Ground, or must we think Being and Ground, Being as Ab-Grund, out of the essence of play, precisely that play into which we mortals, and we alone, are brought, insofar as we dwell in nearness to death, which as the outermost possibility of Dasein is capable of being the highest illumination of Being and its truth? Death is the still unthought standard of the im 2SSat: vom Grund, p. 187. Nietzsche's words on the death of God have already been invoked by this time, at p. 170.

Since it is the symbol which gives us to think (Ricoeur), Fink calls the question Spiel als Welt symbol. II. Child's Play After Plato and Aristotle, the totality of beings is thought primarily in terms of technë. The world is viewed as a product of divine labor, much as the chalice is the product of the silversmith, or the shoe a product of Socrates' friend, Simon the Shoemaker. Occasionally, as in the twelfth book of Aristotle's Metaphysics, such a view falters, and desire or love of the sexes serves the thought which wants to think the cosmos. Occasionally, there is talk of war, polemos, among all things in the world. Labor, love and war are human possibilities which thought transforms into world-possibilities. Play, especially child's play, is one such possibility, but one which post-Heraclitean thought has largely left out of account. In Metaphysics and Death, Professor Fink calls labor or technique, sexual love, struggle or war, and also play, the "operative models" which have dominated the western understanding of the world, of Being, without themselves becoming themes for study.28 Yet nowhere does Fink offer a strictly phenomenological analysis of these models, fearing that such a study might miss their "cosmological and ontological valence." Since each model captures one aspect of that openness to the world characteristic of human existence, Fink elects to pursue a hermeneutical reflection, resembling a poetics more than an eidetics, on their cosmic symbolism. To reduce the cosmic significance of such models to "mere anthropomorphism" clarifies nothing, Fink insists, unless one has accepted in advance that "cheap plausibility which considers itself 'enlightened!" (MT, 192). Does thought modeled on labor, love, struggle or play merely project man's essence onto things and the world, or is man's essence already 11 Sal: vom Grund, pp. 186-7.

One might as well speak of the "ontomorphism" or the "cosmorphism" as of the "anthropomorphism" of such models. Nevertheless, it is true that today thought must inquire into its fondest and most familiar models with thoroughgoing suspicion, in the Nietzschean style, concerning their appropriateness. "Being, Becoming, generation and corruption, can be formulated in likenesses which span the abyss of the unutterable like wispy rope bridges: they have a limited load capacity, and under the strain of massive overloading they break" (MT, 193). What is the cosmic symbolism of human play, and why does Fink's thought get caught up in such play? What is play? We have already mentioned Fink's reluctance to pursue a phenomenology of play, even though abundant material on the subject has been gathered by ethnologists, historians, psychologists and educators. (One need think only of Joseph Campbell, J. Huizinga, Jean Piaget and Marie Montessori, among a score of others.) Perhaps the abundance of material itself, an embarras de richesse, stymies all attempts at eidetic description. Ludwig Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations try to show how the Sprachspiel is played by selecting Spiel itself as an example (cf. § 7). Wittgenstein asks whether the essence of language, or only various relationships within language, can be expressed, and to demonstrate that only the latter is an estimable goal for philosophy, he considers various kinds of "games." There are board games, card games, ball games, Olympic games, and so on. Can we identify something in which all these participate; can we discover game-ness, the very essence of SpieP. "Do not say, 'There must be something common, or they would not be called "games'"—but look and see whether there is anything common to all; (§ 66). "Denk nicht, sondern schau!" Are all games competitive, agonistic? Are they all amusing? At best, one finds series of similarities among the different types of games, which Wittgenstein calls "family resemblances" (§ 67). Out of all these series of similarities and differences no single definition or essence can be educed. "What still counts as a game, and what no longer does? Can you give a boundary? No. You can draw one; for none has so far been drawn" (§68). To the objection that "family resemblance" is too imprecise a standard for language Wittgenstein responds that impreci sion does not call a halt to the language game. Perhaps such imprecision makes the play successful, perhaps such an indistinct 76</page><page sequence="15">David Farrell Krell concept "is exactly what we need" (§ 71)? There are games where we make up the rules as we go along (§ 83); defining a game requires hard and fast rules, playing it does not. Children especially play games with very fluid rules. Are such games imperfect? Only if we persist in being deluded by the logic of the ideal game, only, that is, if we insist on playing on the slippery crystalline surface of logic (§§ 100; 107). Without pretending to have surveyed all the types of Spiel that occur, Fink discerns a "family resemblance" in many kinds of games and playing. The child enthroned and enthralled in his fantasy kingdom and the adult in pursuit of leisurely diversion know of "play situations in the midst of the serious business of life, where existence is suddenly shot through with adventurous or enchanting qualities;" all men know of "playful moments, in 'flirting,' in sports, in all forms of daring and risk; and they also know quite naturally the specifically situated play productions of theater, cinema, radio and television" (Sp, 18-19). Perhaps what all these types of Spiel have in common is this: they involve a curious mixture of reality and unreality (Sp, 66ff.). Play, even the play of tragedy, is never as "serious," never as "real," as labor, love, or war. Play is merely entertainment, a means to refresh oneself for further labor, love or war. Play "flirts" with reality. It only seems to perform labor, make love, or conduct war (Sp, 74-5). Yet its mimicry is not merely "nothing," not unreal in the strict sense. Play is often very real for large groups of people and for long periods of time. Fink therefore takes as the guiding thread of his hermeneutics of play, as cosmic symbol, the family resemblance—in this case something like the Habsburg jaw—of a complex of the real and the unreal. For the Greeks, play, paizö, is what a child, pais, does. The Doric form of the verb "to play," paisdô, betrays its origin even more clearly than the Attic. Children play with playthings or toys, paignion, or play at a game or sport, paigma, or play an instrument, dance, and sing. What is sung is a paian, a paean to Apollo the Healer, himself called Paian or "physician." Playing, singing and dancing occur during religious celebrations, festivals of healing, paignia. Anything suited to children is described as paideos, whether it be a game, paidia, or their education, paideia or paideusis. A less fortunate accompaniment to education may have been paid to hit or strike! Play, education, music, athletics, and the religious festival, are all bound to the same root syllable, which sounds the vocative for Greek children: pai. 77</page><page sequence="16">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel Plato's relation to play is an ambiguous one.29 No other philosopher plays as much in his thinking as Plato, no other enjoys irony and playful seriousness as much as Plato—who, after all, gave us philosophy in texts very much like plays. No philosopher has suffered as much distortion from heavy-handed interpretation, which prefers laborious dogmatics to Socratic investigation. Yet the same Plato fought his battle with the playwrights, the tragedians and comedians, and their reservoir of epic poetry (Sp, 89). And his critique of the mimetic arts, especially painting and drama, while granting play a mediate position between Being and Becoming, as roadsigns pointing beyond themselves, bans play from the realm of essential Being and "drives it out of the heart of the world."30 The play of portraitists and dramatists is a fraudulent technë whose products prove to be at a third remove from the Forms: play mirrors the mere mirror-images of true Being. Dramatic or representative play produces third-rate copies; it apes reality; it is a defective mimesis, a caricature of philosophical dialectics. "This concept of mimesis signifies the genuine disenchant ment of play" (Sp, 101). A new Optik is won, the optics of disenchantment, of sobriety and cool light: "Plato's critique of poetry is an important example of the optics of disenchantment. Only when the mask of the god has fallen from the human countenance can play be unmasked" (Sp, 104). But the optics of disenchantment leaves Plato's hearing, and perhaps his other senses as well, unaffected: Socrates still hearkens to his daimon, prays to Eros for "the lover's talent" (Phaedrus, 257a), and to Pan for "Beauty within and without" (279b), practices music as he waits for death (Phaedo 60dee), celebrates "the superiority of heaven-sent madness over man-made sanity" (Phaedrus, 244d). And Plato still writes dialogues.31 It is undeniably ;"For this question see the detailed article by H. Gundert, "Zum Spiel bei Platon," in Beispiele, ed. L. Landgrebe (The Hague: M. Nijhoff, 1965), pp. 188-221. "'Sp, 93; cf. Gundert, who disagrees, Beispiele, p. 210. "Gundert promulgates a more sympathetic view of play in Plato. When philology carefully follows the meanings of "play" through Plato's work, "the question may perhaps occur to it, whether it is not he [Plato] who has first opened up the possibility for thinking the essence of play, also back behind it and out beyond it, and, indeed, neither by means of polemics nor by melting it down, but rather through the way in which he himself plays. . . . The philologist should perhaps reconsider the question of whether a 'liberation' from Plato's 'viewpoint' can be achieved so long as his relation to play is understood to be primarily one of polemic." Beispiele, p. 221. 16</page><page sequence="17">David Farrell Krell true that the ontological stature of play deteriorates at the beginning of the epoch of metaphysics; the problem is whether we "who have not yet finished annihilating the idols, and who have scarcely begun to understand symbols,"12 are capable of determining Plato's role in (or out of) that epoch. Fink argues that when play is interpreted from the point of view of technë, as a product instead of a pro-ducing, when it is misconceived as an inferior mirror image of reality, as it is in Plato, metaphysics has won the day. Metaphysics could securely erect its conception of the world as a universal, hierarchical and rational structure only when the image of the guiding cosmic totality as play was repressed. "Rational order" or "play"—that was now the question. The work of a planning, fabricating Nous, or the tragicomedy of the rise and fall of all Finite things from the nameless, nocturnal womb and tomb of every individuation? Is being-in-totality a taxis, an intelligible articulation of the all-knowing, of the self-conceiving concept, or is it the ultimately unintelligible play of the child "casting dice here and there?" (Sp, 114). But what is Plato's view of child's play; and on the play of the world? For the late Plato (Laws), child's play is an activity to be guided by the education to wisdom. Paidia is subordinated to padeia or pedagogy, the latter conceived on the model of technique. The Athenian says, "We should try to use games as a means of directing children's tastes and inclinations toward the station they are themselves to Fill when adult" (643c). The future farmer should be equipped with a little hoe, the future carpenter with miniature rule and plumb-bob, the future soldier with a wooden sword. Education should capitalize on that desire of children which Freud describes in Beyond the Pleasure Principle: ". . . all their play is influenced by a wish that dominates them the whole time—the wish to be grown up and to be able to do what grown-up people do."33 Play is to be a mimesis of technë. But the Athenian later admits that there are times when children must be left to their own foolishness; in fact, he declares that "Paul Ricoeur, De l'interprétation, p. 36. "Bantam ed., 1959, p. 36. 79</page><page sequence="18">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel he reserves the name "play," Paidian, for "harmless pleasure," where the good or ill to be gained is "not worth taking into serious account'' (667e). The younger Plato (Republic) argues, on the other hand, that the labor of pedagogy ought to be itself a mimesis of play! Socrates warns Glaucon (at 536e) that the character of education, even if it be a preparation for toil, should be playful: "A free soul ought not to pursue any study slavishly. ... Do not then, my friend, keep children at their studies by compulsion but by play, tous paidas en tois mathëmasin alla paizontas trephe. Like the playfulness of Platonic thought in general, the playfulness of his pedagogy has been largely forgotten. We might do well to read again his critique of dramatic art in the Republic (601-607). The criticism of dramatic poetry which follows the discussion of representational art in general does appear to condemn play. Dramatic play encourages a lawless display of emotions, such as grief, if the play be tragic; comedy encourages men, on the other hand, to "play the fool" outside the theater. In both cases the highest part of the soul (the reflective part) is overruled by the lower, enthusiastic part. The calm and wise character of the man who reflects does not lend itself to representation in plays; the playwright prefers emotional characterizations, Ajax raving against Odysseus, or Pentheus furious with Cadmus. The playwright thus "sets up a vicious form of government in the individual soul," and, like the painter, "he is an image-maker whose images are phantoms far removed from reality" (604e). The argument that dramatic play promotes limitless enthusiasm pales when one considers the fate of heroes whose emotions carry them beyond all bounds: Ajax's fate hardly encourages pride and revenge; Pentheus' horrid end scarcely promotes hardness of heart or lust. The case of comedy is harder to judge: perhaps Strepsiades' antics against Socrates in The Clouds were later emulated by more vicious men in Athens. Perhaps, in the case of tragedy, Plato is thinking of a sort of play far inferior to what we have from Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides? The great Greek plays, as Fink argues, are not mirror images or copies which dialectic might improve: poetic mimesis is not like the reflection of palm trees in the water. "It does not mirror; it signifies" (Sp, 106; cf. 86-9). Finally, a curious revelation is made during the critique concerning the nature of reflection, which is to rule and restrain emotions such as 80</page><page sequence="19">David Farrell Krell grief. This revelation concerns not only dramatic play, but also the play of the world. It reminds us that Plato's criticism of play resists all one-sided interpretations. Socrates opposes the wanton breast-beating and hair-tearing of drama, and encourages the exercise of calmness in the face of catastrophe. He explains, "By this I mean reflection on what has happened, letting reason decide on the best move in the game of life that the fall of the dice permitspros ta peptokota (604c). At the heart of Plato's critique of artistic play appears Heraclitus, and with him the child at play: the play of the world. To sum up: the child at play, abandoned to the game which is simultaneously make-believe and entirely real, finds no place in the universe of metaphysics, where adult intelligence and responsibility devote themselves to the wholly real and rational. But his banishment is complete only after Plato, and perhaps even after Aristotle, when, as Heidegger has suggested, philosophers were replaced by school teachers. Nietzsche once more befriends the child at play, as a symbol of the world, in his announcements of the death of God. But the death of the god has always been the subject of cult or ritual play. III. Ritual Play Heidegger writes that it is mortals alone who, dwelling in nearness to death, experience the brightest illumination of Being and its truth. Perhaps the darkest of Heraclitus' dark sayings (fr. 62), however, involves immortals in the very same play: "Immortals mortals, mortals immortals: each lives the death of the other and dies their life" (H, 157ff). How do gods die the life of mortals, and live their death? Such a question does not mean to demand an existential ontology for gods! Rather, the anxiety it engages to thought is that metaphysics and theology have no language through which to respond to the question. Only the language of Hölderlin's Hyperion, and perhaps the music and lyric of Leonard Bernstein's Kaddish can respond to Heraclitus' thought. William Butler Yeats wrote a play about the death of gods, particularly of Dionysus and Christ, which he called, "The Resurrec tion." Its prologue contains the following verse: I saw a staring virgin stand Where holy Dionysus died, And tear the heart out of his side, And lay the heart upon her hand And bear that beating heart away; 81</page><page sequence="20">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel And then did all the Muses sing Of Magnus Annus at the spring, As though God's death were but a play.34 "Cult is older than philosophy" (Sp, 140). But that is scarcely reason enough for philosphy to study the play of ritual. Professor Fink offers three closely related reasons for such a move (Sp, 171 f0- First, play, especially theater-play, has its origin in ritual. Such ritual is by no means a leisure activity for archaic man, however, but is the most serious business of his life. It prescribes formulas and gestures which are attuned to the superhuman forces which mean the survival or destruction of the tribe. The most important technë for archaic man is the deed of the medicine-man or shaman, who must know with precision how one traffics with demons, how one distinguishes good from evil spirits, how one can effect cures and invoke curses. The meaning of all things and events in the world of the primitive is determined by prescriptions of ritual play. Play is of all actions the most real. Second, in ritual play the "mere appearance" which philosophy since Plato has abjured assumes a more positive aspect. Every participant in ritual play knows that behind the mask of the god stands a man, but this knowledge does not cause disillusion ment (Sp, 173). In a manner hardly intelligible to those who see according to the optics of disenchantment, the unreality or "mere appearance" in ritual play does not contradict, but rather guarantees for primitive man the efficacy of "a deeper, truer and more genuine reality, indeed the reality of omnipotent forces and powers" (Sp, 174). Third, the powers of the most real reality of ritual play are beings of superhuman origin; they are demons and gods. If philosophy has ever involved with the efficacy of deeds (techne), with the distinction between genuine reality and mere appearance, and with the highest types of beings, then it cannot now ignore the symbolics of ritual play. "We need cult play in order to pose our problem, because in it play is experienced as most earnest seriousness, and its 'unreality' as the entrance way to the more genuine reality" (Sp, 175; cf. 148). Shortly before his death in 1961, C.G. Jung compiled an illustrated book on his psychology, called Man and His Symbols.*5 One of its "Reprinted in Collected Poetry (New York: Macmillan), p. 210. "German ed. by Walter-Verlag, 1968, pp. 44-5. 82</page><page sequence="21">David Farrell Krell most striking pages contains two photographs, one of a tall black man wearing a lion mask and crouching among yellow grass, the other of a dictionary opened to the page where "Lion" appears. In the second photograph one reads: "Lion: noun, masculine; four-footed mammal frequenting the African plains south of the Sahara, etc." What sort of education would one require in order to look understandingly at both photographs? What is the native in the lion mask doing? He is playing lion. But this play is mere silliness to us, unless we have learned what Joseph Campbell calls "the lesson of the mask." The mask in a primitive festival is revered and ex perienced as a veritable apparition of the mythical being that it represents—even though everyone knows that a man made the mask and that a man is wearing it. The one wearing it, furthermore, is identified with the god during the time of the ritual of which the mask is a part. He does not merely represent the god; he is the god.36 Ritual play occurs in a curious ambience of "as if," which requires that the unreality of the situation enhance the power of its reality. This enhancement need not, as in complete seizure or possession, ob literate consciousness of the "as if." J. Huizinga notes, "As far as I know, ethnolgoists and anthropologists concur in the opinion that the mental attitude in which the great religious feasts of savages are celebrated and witnessed is not one of complete illusion. There is an underlying consciousness of things 'not being real'."37 Within the mask, man goes forth to meet gods and demons, as one among them: he can, within the mask, once again "become everything" (Sp, 159). The man behind the mask does not play with it, however; it is not a toy. He is caught up in a cosmic play within sacred time which he by no means initiates, a play which re-enacts the genesis of the tribe and of the world. Ritual play is a kind of world-play. Professor Fink argues that ritual play is nevertheless not completely adequate to the Heraclitean thought on cosmic play, for several reasons. First, cult is itself the outcome of a gradual forgetfulness of "Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God, 4 vols. (New York: Viking, 1959-1968), vol. 1, Primitive Mythology, "Introduction: The Lesson of the Mask," p. 21. "J. Huizinga, Homo Ludens, tr. R.F.C. Hull (London: Routledge and Regan Paul, 1949), p. 22. Quoted by Campbell, Ibid., p. 23. 83</page><page sequence="22">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel the cosmic depth in things; it seeks to restore the sacred character of things which has somehow been lost. "The cult is an attempt at a restoration of the original cosmic luminosity, das Weltlicht, in all individuated, finite things" (Sp, 130). Rilke perhaps represents a recent attempt at a sacralization of common entities when he writes, in 1925, Jetzt wär es Zeit, dass Götter träten aus bewohnten Dinge.. ,3S Second, the resoration of cosmic depth to things is limited to a certain sphere of items. Such are the things of the temple, itself a sacred precinct in the midst of profane buildings, served by priests, them selves sacred men among profane men (Sp, 131). Third, and most im portant, ritual play concerns itself with relations among beings, among priests, sacred vessels, and gods, while overlooking the rela tion between things and the world-totality (Sp, 134). Whether ritual play involves crude demons or highly polished divinities, and whether their residence is held to be in things or "outside" the world, the cult of the sacred is "a play before god, and is not immediately worldly" (Sp, 157). That is to say, cult play covers over the play of the world in which individual beings, be they men, demons, gods or God, come to appearance and disappear (Sp, 17Iff.). Even when the world-totality is conceived as the play of divinities, and man as a toy of the gods, the play of the world is obscured.39 "Insel-Verlag ed., II, 185. "In the Laws, at 644d and 803c, Plato calls man "a plaything of the gods," theou ti paignion, and a kind of "puppet." At 902b, the Athenian affirms that men are "chattel of the gods," ktëmala thêon this suggesting that the immortals have no need at all of mortals, and that life is divine sport and human misery. Yet there is an ambiguity here. Perhaps the gods get absorbed in their play with men—perhaps mor tals fascinate them! (Cf. Sp, 179-80.) Such absorption would mean the passion of the gods. When God becomes passio pura, as with Feuerbach, he dies for the sake of his playthings. The ambiguity of divine play with mortals may aid our reading of Hegel's Encyclopedia, §§ 564-571, and Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion, part three, as well as the 62nd fragment of Heraclitus. Like Zarathustra, however, Fink would be suspicious of the unemployed last Pope's insistence that God's death was one of corn-passion: he resists any speculation on the theological import of cult play. Cf. Sp, 197 ff., and also pp. 144-5: "Every attempt to dissolve religion in philosophy results in the theologizing of philosophy." 84</page><page sequence="23">David Farrell Krell Ritual play and religion must therefore become symbols of man's relation to the world-totality. For philosophy, the play of gods can only be a simile for the ecstatic play of men within the play of the world (cf. Sp, 144). IV. World Play "The world itself is neither holy like God, nor unholy like the wicked man; it is 'beyond' such distinctions" (Sp, 206). Ritual play, while exhibiting the high seriousness of human play, mistakes the play of intramundane entities (among which even "transcendent" gods are included) for the play of being-in-totality. "World play" is a name for the identity and difference of intramundane entities and the totality of being. All products of nature and of human art are contained in the world. The world is that within which things arise, change place, are moved or at rest, pass away, are singular yet among many, are subsumable under Forms and categories, and so forth (Sp, 209). "World" is therefore a name for "being-in-totality," and a thing's being is its cosmic or worldly significance. "It [the world] surrounds and embraces all things, and is not itself separated from things; rather, things belong to it, and the innerworldly as such is an essential moment of the world" (Sp, 217). But the world does not contain things as a sack contains potatoes; it cannot be itself an intramundane entity. The world is different from worldly things, little things such as toys and big things such as God. Fink attempts to lay bare the worldly character of play—its cosmic significance—by distinguishing four meanings in the term "worldly" (Sp, 207ff.). First, "worldly" means the intramundane being of all finite things and events. Men and their activities, including play, are "worldly" in this sense. Second, "worldly" may refer, not to items within the totality, but to the totality as such, the ruling, steering or guiding, Walten, of the world. Whatever appears in time and space disappears as well, gods, stars, and men—"the most evanescent of all vanishing things" (Sp, 57). But that which gives time and space, that which endures through all change, is the world. The course of the world is the "process of universal individuation," by which all intramundane entities undergo generation and corruption. But the course, the process, does not itself succumb to individuation. Human play, however, is hardly "worldly" in this second sense: it does not steer the universe, does not give space and let time be, at least not 85</page><page sequence="24">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel aboriginally. Third, "worldly" refers to Dasein's way of comporting itself towards the world in an understanding fashion: man is the intramundane entity already involved in an understanding of his way to be. Play is "worldly" in this sense, and indeed constitutes an exceptional mode of intelligent behavior. "When we play, we under stand the ruling totality differently from the way we do in labor, struggle, love, or in the cult of the dead; other sides, other dimensions, open up for us" (Sp, 225). This is especially so when play is social, i.e., when it involves other Daseins with whom we communicate, and when it is artistic. In the fifteenth of his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Men (1795), Schiller writes, "Man plays only when he is a man in the full meaning of the word; and he is only completely a man when he plays."40 Fourth, "worldly" has a derogatory meaning in the Chris tian era, signifying "pagan absorption in the sensuous." Play is perhaps also "worldly" in this fourth sense: in play there arises "a practically 'pagan' carefreeness, a joy in the senses, an enigmatic love of semblance, of suggestion, of the glitter of colors, of the 'peach skin' of all things" (Sp, 227). Whether play is to be deprecated for its "paganism," as though this were its guilt, is of course another matter. Rimbaud's "Sun and Flesh" celebrates the innocence of paganism, or, rather, of "les temps de l'antique jeunesse," under the sign of Venus, in the groves of Pan. Man then was happy, Rimbaud argues, Comme un petit enfant, jourant sur ses genoux, —Parce qu'il était fort, l'Homme était chaste et doux.41 ■"'Quoted in Ernst Cassirer, Essay on Man (Yale University Press), p. 165; and in Fink, Oase des Glücks, p. 18, Cf. Sp, 227. 4lWhether after Nietzsche the term "pagan" ought to be applied to "worldly" activities is doubtful. Certainly it is nonsensical to deride early Greek play as "pagan." Even Euripides, whom, it is trde, Nietzsche takes to task for his aesthetic Socratism, i.e. his willingness to defend what needs no defense, forestalls such talk. In the Bacchae he takes particular pains to make manifest the purity and exalted tone of Dionysian play. It is the hardhearted King Pentheus who fears corruption and who is himself corrupted and destroyed in the course of the tragedy by his resistance to Dionysian play. The theme of the play is, "Whoever seeks unholiness will find it" (1. 493). Teiresias warns Pentheus early on of the nemesis which struck Actaeon (1. 340), and urges him, as the ghost urges Hamlet, not to "taint his mind" with thoughts against the god. "Do you fear for the maidens?/Think now: is it for Dionysus/To secure their purity? All rests with them/And their own hearts; and even in the most frenzied rite/No stain besmirches her whose heart is white." (11. 315-19). 86</page><page sequence="25">David Farrell Krell What is most remarkable about the relation of human play to the four senses of "worldly" is this: play is "worldly" in the first, third, and fourth senses (it is an intramundane activity of innerworldly beings, it is an exceptional mode of Dasein's behavior towards the world, and it is a pre-Christian, pre-metaphysical, hence "pagan," activity); but precisely that which wants to be thought here (play as a symbol of the ruling cosmic totality) seems denied to us! Ritual play approximates the ruling totality, at least prior to the epoch of metaphysics and its optics of disenchantment. What Fink proposes, however, stands in contrast to metaphysics' repression of the cosmic significance of play and ritual's confusion of demonic play and world play. He considers play a cosmic symbol which realizes the ontological difference between beings and Being. The symbol says: the world is play without a player. When man labors, struggles or loves, he comports himself to other beings: a pot, the enemy, or the beloved. He stands in the real world, among innerworldly entities (Sp, 228). At play, he may manipulate toys, gesticulate and chase, but everything turns in an imaginary sphere, in an "unreal City," in the realm of "mere appearance." This does not mean that play is an inferior copy of genuine activities, or a defective mimesis; the distance from "real things" allows playspace for something else which is not a thing at all, which is a no-thing, namely, the world in which all things come to presence and withdraw. Within this playspace it may be possible to think on the relation of man and world. "The play of the world is no one's play, because there are 'someones,' persons, men or gods, for the first time within such play; and the play-world of world-play is not "mere appearance,' Schein, but rather coming-to-light, Erscheinung" (Sp, 241). The onto logical significance of play as a symbol of the cosmos rests in this characteristic: play dissolves the subject-object relation which The maiden chorus has already made this clear at the opening of the play: it calls upon the Theban sisters to take up the thyrsos, "And don the fawn-skin, fringed in purity/With fleecy white, like our own." Whoever is borne away on the magic breath of the god is cleansed, blessed, without sin or folly, and near to god (11. 72-76; 112-14). Dionysus tells Pentheus, "His mysteries abhor the touch of sin-lovers" (II. 478-9). The messenger from Cithaeron, who has seen the Bacchae (11. 684-87), confirms their "cold purity." Is the world of Dionysian ritual play "pagan?" Only if Pentheus is the first Christian. 87</page><page sequence="26">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel dominates modern metaphysics and epistemology, and gets beneath the distinction of objective and subjective validity to the emergence of beings as such in the world. Man does not constitute the world, does not in-form or synthesize it, as though it were a chaos and he a working model of the Demiurge. Man and world are not two separate entities which somehow get related: man and world are enclosed together, zusammengeschlossen, and disclosed together, zusammenerschlossen, belong and listen to one another within the play of their Zusammengehörigkeit,42 In the technological era, in which the model of sober, calculative manipulation dominates thought, the world is disclosed as a fund of energy, and enclosed by man's uncon ditioned will-to-will. In such an era the metaphysical banishment of play nears completion. Play dwindles ... to leisure. Is it at all possi ble in our time to affirm the hazardous course of the world which in dividuates, which lets things rise and fall, as in a play without a player—neither God nor cybernetician? Is it at all possible to entertain the frivolous performance which mixes truth and illusion? Whether there can be such entertainment and such affirmation is a question for thought. V. Thought Play Human play does not rule the world-totality. It is not "worldly" in the second sense. The play of human thought does not instantiate the world; it is not a noesis noesiös. But, being within the world and comporting itself towards the world, play can symbolize the world. Play mixes the real and unreal: in play the real and unreal rise and fall together. But this is the meaning of symballein, "to fall together." In symbol, the real and unreal fall together—like two halves of a broken coin becoming one again, or Aristophanes' broken her maphrodites achieving intercourse (Sp, 118-19). In a sense, all beings are symbols, pieces of the world, fragments of Being, joined in and as the world-totality. Hen te panta. Play is an exceptional mode of being, however, and can become an image or likeness, Gleichnis, of the cosmos. How does this happen? What sort of likeness could maintain between finite beings and the infinite world-totality? Does not such a J,Fink, Sp, 18; 232-3; and elsewhere. Cf. Heidegger, "Der Satz der Identität," in Identität und Differenz, esp. pp. 18-20. 88</page><page sequence="27">David Farrell Krell difference shatter all identity or likeness (cf. Sp, 235)? "World and thing are incomparable," so long as likeness among intramundane entities is meant. "The world is not like things, and things are not like the world" (Sp, 236). Yet, intramundane entities can be called "moments of the world," in the sense that the ruling totality can shine back on an individual item, bringing it to light and suggesting something of the totality. The coming and going of world moments constitutes the pervasive and enduring style of the world. Such a style leads one to speak of the orderliness and lawfulness of things in the world. According to the metaphysical tradition, everything in the world has its Ground or sufficient reason for being. But what about the world itself? Does the world-totality have a Ground? Does the orderliness of things and events within the world, things which strive after goals and win them, allow us to speak of the totality as orderly, i.e., as very much like intramundane entities? Is the course of the world itself lawful, intelligible, or teleological? Or are such questions today without sense? Is world play a game in which rules are defined once for all, or is it a game which is not defined, but rather played? "The monstrous cosmological significance of modern 'nihilism'" makes a goal for the world-totality not only unknowable but also non sensical. The world is "without grounds or goals, without meaning and end, without value and plan," although this does not mean that the world is a goalless, groundless, endless, meaningless and valueless thing (cf. Sp, 238). That the world is "-less," or loosed from, goals and grounds, meanings and values, means that it reflects the human moment which is "-less," or released from, the spirit of seriousness of labor, struggle and love. The meaninglessness of the world is reflected in the intramundane sphere of human meaningfulness when man sets aside a free space among his goal-directed activities, in which he can pursue something for its own human sake, and not for any business motive. Play aims at no external goal, but has its ends only in itself. As a whole it is, as is said, "without purpose, zwecklos." (Sp, 239). In the midst of purposeful, intelligible, well-grounded and ordered human affairs, play best reflects the totality. But what sort of "reflection," zurückscheinen, is this? Fink concedes that this reflection 89</page><page sequence="28">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel of the world-totality in play can be assigned "to the medium of appearance, Schein only." For, no intramundane entity or activity of man can really be like the ruling totality; or, better, it can really only be like (which also means unlike) the totality. Above we suggested that world-play "gets beneath" the distinction of subjective and objective validity, of the unreal and real, inasmuch as it refers to primordial coming-to-light, Erscheinung. We have not yet asked what that "getting beneath" entails. Does thought play on the play of the world bring anything at all to light, or is its product mere semblance? In his Prologomena to Any Future Metaphysics, Kant declares that our thought on notions such as "world-totality" or "ruling totality" can only produce analogies: "The proper expression for our fallible mode of conception would be: that we imagine the world as if its being and inner character were. . . ,"43 Kant says, ". . . were derived from a supreme mind." Fink says, ". . . were play." Since play is a mixture of the real and unreal, of truth and illusion, thought play, which after Nietzsche is far more fragile than Kant's "fallible mode of conception," does not produce analogies: it entertains symbols. "Human play is therefore a world symbol" (Sp, 239). The broken coin is never perfectly joined. Perfect identity is broken by the play of truth and illusion in human play. This is because men are themselves broken, and are forever Fitting themselves to a world. Merleau-Ponty says that mortals are a flaw in the cosmic diamond.44 This flaw gives playspace for what is called "thinking." What sort of thought is it that would conceive of play as a possible and even worthwhile matter for philosophy? "How can something which seems to be so peripheral to human life have a transcending, cosmic significance?" (Sp, 16). "World-play" is not even a peripheral phenomenon: it is nothing more than a "thought" or a "speculative symbol" (Sp, 17). "World-play" is indeed flawed, broken by a hyphen and isolated by inverted commas. Can thinking and play coincide in a world where, in the fault which offers playspace, the shadow of nothingness is cast over all human projects? In Metaphysics and Death, a work whose very title suggests ■"Kant, Prologomena, § 58. I am indebted to Joseph Campbell, Masks, I, 28, for this reference. "Sense and Non-Sense, tr.

Sobriety and play? Illusionless self understanding and SpieP Arthur Schopenhauer assures us that death, and not play, has nurtured the finest fruits of religion and philosophy.45 Fink seems to agree: "Death is the strongest impulse to our longing, our thinking and poetizing; it is the imaginary zone into which all speculative dreams settle. Perhaps all worlds 'Beyond' are mediated by death" (MT, 56). Is play a speculative dream, an escape to another world? On the contrary, Professor Fink's understanding of play includes that duplicity by which Dasein's nearness to death is its presence to the world, so that sobriety and an illusionless understan ding of our existence go together with play. We may do well to heed again, as Fink has done, Heidegger's question in Satz vom Grund: Can the essence of play be appropriately determined out of Being as Ground, or must we think Being and Ground, Being as the abyss, out of the essence of play; precisely that play into which we mortals, and we alone, are brought, insofar as we dwell in nearness to death; which enables the outermost possibility of Dasein to be the highest illumination of Being and its truth? Death is the still unthought standard of the immeasurable, that is, of the highest play which brings man to earth and establishes him there. Metaphysical thought has attacked the problem of death by, in Goethe's words, "dragging it back into life," and has failed to find place for death, as Dasein's Being-unto-an-end, in its interpre tation of Being. But play as cosmic symbol is "a mode of thinking which has wound its way from Heraclitus to Nietzsche under ground all philosophy" (MT, 186, our emphasis). Thought-play does not seek to abandon the flawed earth for a world Beyond, whose portal would be death; it does not drag death back into life in order to deprive it of its sting and victory. But the life of thought-play is an anticipation of death, and is a witness of its own frangibility. 45Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung (Köln: Atlas Verlag), part 11, chapter 41, p. 1,038. 91</page><page sequence="30">Towards an Ontology of Play: Eugen Fink's Notion of Spiel In the Gorgias, at 485a-c, Callicles, whom Socrates praises as a touchstone of the truth, and a man of knowledge, good will and frankness, derides philosophy as a form of idle play. He says, It is a good thing to engage in philosophy in so far as it is an aid to education, and it is no disgrace for a youth to study it; but when a man who is now growing older still studies philosophy, Socrates, the situation becomes ridiculous. I feel towards philosophers very much as I do towards those who talk baby-talk and play the child. When I see a little child, for whom it is still proper enough to speak in this way, lisping and playing, I like it. . . . But when one hears a grown man lisping, or sees him playing the child, it looks absurd, unmanly, and worthy of a good beating. I feel exactly the same about students of philosophy. Eugen Fink wonders aloud whether "a reflection on play, this foolishness of children, can ultimately topple the self-secure knowledge of grownups" (Sp, 18). Perhaps it can, but only if its assertions about play are themselves playful, only, in short, if it speaks the Socratic language of response. Such reflection does not play the language game, but is itself caught up in the play of language. "If we may talk here of playing games at all," Heidegger writes in the second half of Was heisst Denkeril, "it is not we who play of words, but the nature of language which plays with us.. . ."46 And still this reflection on play must know that Callicles has to be about, paddle at the ready, in case play should be out of place. Something has happened to the grownups, however, whom Fink calls "centaurs," animal bodies with human heads. No longer can philosophy be the reasonable activity it once was, when the spirits of asceticism and seriousness ruled. Reason itself is no longer that "cold, glaring light, which seemed appropriate to an anemic, dried out humanity, cut off from genuine existential experience; reason is rather the most passionate of passions, the most unbridled desire, and, as Plato's dialogues show, is permeated at its roots by Eros" (Sp, 30).

Heraclitus gives us to think that the course of the world is a child at play. Professor Fink finds it essential to argue that the course of the world is play without a player. How then: is the world the play of an innocent, or is it innocent of players? The first can be properly thought only through the second: when the child plays there is no player. Everything is played. 1 remember a heavy iron orange and black taxi-cab, fashioned on the model of an English cab: it was my plaything. I pushed the in destructible toy through puddles in the alley; often I lay on the living-room carpet with the car a few inches from my nose. 1 remember now precisely how the hub caps were set, how the metal tires sounded as they rolled, and even what it was like to drive inside the cab. Only reluctantly did I climb out, and I never really put away that toy. It possessed me until, nearly a man, I unwillingly gave it to another child. It had been given to my father by a man whose only son died at nine teen years, either by leukemia or the war, I do not remember. I used to imagine that one gray morning I would step into the cab and meet a slight, silent young man whose parents weep for him and for themselves, and that we would splash through vast puddles, awaiting the next owner. The orange and black English cab would gather all together and steer to parts unknown. The child at play does not comport himself to intramundane objects. Rather, he plays in the Difference, as that being who responds to the presence and absence of things, to Being, Anwesenheit, parousia. 93</page></plain_text>
