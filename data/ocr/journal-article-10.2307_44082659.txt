M., Vakil, Higfi Court, Bombay, on the opening of the Mimāīisā Vidyalaya at Poma m 10th August 1924). I deem it a great honour to have ïfeen invited to address this assembly on the auspicious occasion of the opening of the Mimāīisā Vidyalaya in Poona. My feelings are somewhat mixed on this occasion. I feel great diffidence in undertaking the task entrusted to me. The proper person to deliver an address on the opening of a school for Mīmānsā is one who has made a lifelong and profound study of that Sastra. It would have îbeen a most fortunate thing if the authorities of this new institution had been able to secure the services of an eminent Mlmāfisist and Sanskrit scholar like the Hon'ble Mahāmaho- pâdhyâya Dr. Ganganath Jhà. But I was told that owing to ill^health that eminent scholar oould not grace this occasion. I have great admiration for the Sikshaņa-prasaraka-mandali of Poona that has been rendering yeoman service for over thirty years in the -cause of education in all its stages in the Bombay Presidency. The Mlmanga Vidyalaya is to be maintained under the auspices of such a worthy body. I have been for some years a student of the Mīmānsā, though a very indifferent one. When, therefore, the authorities of this institution asked me to preside on the occasion of the opening of the MlmãfísS Vidyalaya I could not refuse. I, however, hope that you will pardon me if I do not fulfil what you have a right to expect</page><page sequence="2">2 P. V. Kane . from one who ventures to preside on such an occasion as this. My only excuse is my inability to say 'no' to the authorities of this institution on account of my regard for the good work they have been doing and my great love for thé Mīmāfisā. I propose on this occasion to give a brief outline of the history of the Mīmānsā, of the contents of the Pūrva-mīmānsā- sötra, of the Sanskrit literature on the Mīmāfisā,of the contribu- tion of the Mīmānsā to the thought and philosophy of India, of is rtules of textual interpretation and their application to the Dharmaéastra, of the necessity of codifying the Hindu Law and last, though not the least, of the utility and advisability of starting a special school for MīmāRsā in these days. The word Mīmānsa goes very far into antiquity. In the History of the Word Mīmānsā. Taittirîya Sarhhitā (VII. 5. 7. 1) it is said the expounders of Brahma discuss (the Question) whether (a day) should be omitted or not ; on this (they) say that it must be left out.' Here the word Mīmānsante ' is used in the sense of investigating a doubtful point and arriving at a conclusion thereon. In numerous other places similar doubtful points introduced by the words 'the expounders of brahma say' are put forward without employing the word 'mīmānsante' (e.g. Tai. S. II.5. 3. 7). In the Tändya- mahābrāhmaņa (6. 5. 9) we read ' one should not discuss the merits of a Brāhmaņa.'2 In another passage of the same Brāh- maņa, the form ' mīmāfiseran ' occurs (23. 4. 2).3 In the Ķausī* taki Brālimaņa, the form 'mīmānsante* occurs very frequently. For example, in one place (II. 9) it is said 4 they investigate (the question) whether oblation should be offered to fire when the sun rises or before the sun rises ' and, after making remarks on each of the two alternatives, the conclusion is established that the oblation is to be offered before sunrise.4 In another place, the word 'mlmānsante' is used and the opinions of Paingya and Kausitaki are opposed to each other (Kausïtaki Br. 26. 3). The word 'mīmāfisā' occurs in the Kausltakibrāhmaņa (18.4) ' now begins the discussion of the paridhāna (conclusion) itself. In^hé Kāņva recension of the Śatapatha Brāhmaņa we have the word Mīmānsā (S.B. E.

' In the Chändögya (5.11.1) it is said that several learned students like Prācīna- éãfa Aupamanyava came together and discussed the question 'who is the self, what is brdhma .'s In the Taittirlya Upanishad (II. 8. 1) occur the words 'this is the (result òr fruit of) discus- sion over Bliss.* From all these quotations it is clear that the verb ' mīmāfisante ' and the word 'mīmāfisā' had from the re- motest times to the times of the TJpanishads been employed to designate discussions of doubtful points in ritual or philosophy. Iņ the Nirukta (chap. VII) we have a very interesting discussion about the form of the deities invoked at sacrifices and in mantras and various views are put forward viz. that they have an anthropomorphic aspect or thąt they have no such aspect and so on. This very subject is discusseci in the Pūrvamlmānsāsūtra (IX. 1. 6-10), where the authori- tative conclusion seems to be that the deity in a sacrifice has no corporeal form. Panini (III. 1. 6) has a special sūtra to explain such forms as ' mlmāfisate,' ' blbhatsate ' 6 &amp;e. In the Baudhãyana (I. 4. 10) and Vasistha (22. 2) Dharmasütras we meet with the verb 'mīmāfisante.' Some of the Dharma- sütras contain purely Mīmāfisā rules and doctrines. The Gau- tama Dharmasūtra says (1. 5) ' when there is a conflict of two texts of equal potency, there is an option.' Āpastamba says (Dharmasūtra 1. 1. 4. 8) ' a positive Yedic text is more cogent than usage that leads to the inference (of the existence of ą Yedic text).'7 This resembles Jaimini's dictum (1. 3.3).8 In another place Āpastamba (1.4. 12.11) says 'where an action is due to the finding of pleasure therefrom, there is no (inference of) Sastra." This is the same as Jaimini's teaching (in IV.1.2).10 Āpastamba seems to apply the word ' nyãya ' to the maxims of Mīmāfisā (e. g. II. 4. 8. 13 and II. 6. 14. 13). 11 Āpas- 5 srr#rerra aÍTOfqw: íňw it 3 arrwr sitfò #rre: 1 1. z. 6 i A VSitîka on this says ' ' 7 Sânrfï i B ' ffîft'trôlçpf srrçsfô si^wu- 9 TT g sfiräMciKW- HÍÑ-Í ČPT I 10 ĪHĢct stl^: 3W ČT5PT ť^nídyuiimTWra" ! 11 The two astras are ' g and 3T?nfì" » For the. first, compare Jaimini 1. 3. 11-14 and VI. 7. 30 ' ariforçt m ' for the second«</page><page sequence="4">4 P, F. Kane, tamba (II. 6. 13. 11) bears a close resemblance to PurvamlmāSgā (VT. 1.15). The Mahãbhãsya of Patañjali speaks of Mīmāfi- sakas (Kielhorn, Yol. I. page 239). Patañjali instances a Brah- mani, who studied Kaśakrtsm i. e. the Mīmāfisā propounded by Kãéakrtsni (Yol. II. pp. 206, 249, 325). 12 A Kaśakrtsna is referred to as a teacher of Vedānta in the Brahrnasūtras (1. 4. 22). It iß possible that the word Mīmānsā here does not stand for the Purvamīmānsā, but for the Vedãntaéãstra. PataSjali gives the well-known example of Parisaňkhya, ' the five five-nailed animals may be eaten' and remarks that this sentence implies that other animals are forbidden as food 13 (Vol. I. p. 5). These considerations enable us to assert that centuries before the Christian era the doctrines of the Mīmāflsā had been well de- veloped and that they had been embodied in the form of works before the time of PataSjali (140 B. 0. ). This conclusion is further corroborated by the Srautasūtras. Many of the Srautasūtras were composed several centuries before Christ and presuppose most of the general principles of interpretation that are embodied in Jaimini's work. It is very difficult to arrive even at an approximate condu- it» a ge of Jaimini. sion as to the age of Jaimini. His sūtras do not contain any express reference to Buddhist dogma and philosophy. The Mlmānsāsūtra speaks of Dharmašāstra ( VI. 7.5 ) and Smrti ( XII. 4.42 ). If we rely upon the interpretations of Sabara, the sūtras of Jaimini presuppose the existence of the Kalpasūtras ( I. 3.11 ) and of certain words borrowed from the Mlecchas ( I. 3.10 ). All these facts naturally render it highly probable that the sūtras of Jaimini are not amongst the earliest products of the sütra period. The sūtras of Jaimini stand in a peculiar relation to the Vedāntasūtras. It is to be noted that Jaimini refers to Bādarāyaņa as an authority in several places ( I. 1. 5, V. 2. 19, VI. 1. 18, X. 8. 44, XI. 1. 64 ). In all these cases exoept one ( in X. 8. 44 ) the views of Bādarāyaņa do not appear to be different from those of Jaimini. Except in one case all the points on which Bādarāyaņa is cited are concerned with matters of ritual and there is nothing in the extant Vedāntasūtras corresponding to the views of Bãdarãyana quoted in the Pūrvamīmāfisāsūtra. The only exception is the 12 qrRifftFHf iter crater qnaf&lt;frît «ïwjfi t 13 sfih</page><page sequence="5">The Pürva-mimalUa Systém. S view of B&amp;darãyana that the oonneotion between word and sense is eternal ( Pūrva M. I. 1. 5 ), which may be said te correspond to the views underlying Brahmasūtra ( 1.3. 28-29 ). On the other hand in the Brahmasūtras Jaiminťs views are cited at least ten times ( I. 2. 28, 1. 2. 31, 1. 3. 31, III. 2. 40, III 4. 2, III. 4. 18, III. 4. 40, IV. 3. 12, IV. 4. 5, IV. 4. 11 ). It is only in two oases out of these that it is possible to select sutras from the extant Pūrvamīmānsā that seem to adumbrate the views attributed to Jaimini, viz. Brahmasūtra I. 3. 31 is parallel to Pūrvamlmānsā VI« 1. 5. and Brahmasūtra III, 2. 40 to Pūrvamīmānsā II. 1. 5. 14 Besides in five out of these ten places, the views of Bãdarãyana are expressly cited in the Brahma- gūtras as opposed to those of Jaimini ( I. 3. 33, III. 2. 41, III. 4. 1, III. 4. 19, IV. 4. 11 ) and in one place as somewhat different ( IV. 4. 7 ). It has further to be borne in mind that in several sutras of the Brahmasūtra some Mīmānsā work dealing with similar topics is expressly referred to e. g. Brahmasūtra III. 3. 33 and 50 contain the words ' taduktam * and refer to some such sutras as Pūrvamīmānsā III. 3. 9. and II. 3. 3. respectively. Similarly Brahmasūtra III. 3. 44 and 49 have in view the well- known Mimānsā-sūtra ' Sruti-liůga &amp;c.' III. 3. 13. This state pf things suggests several probable conclusions. From the faet that Jaiminťs views are cited on topics of brahmavidyü &amp; nd Bâdarâyana's on topics of Vedic sacrifices and minutiae of ritual, it may be urged with good reason that both had com- posed works on Vedic ritualistic interpretation as well as on the interpretation of the Upanishads. It is also probable that, without there being actual compositions of the two âcãryas on both the branches of Sruti texts, there was an oral tradition handed down in their respective schools about the views held by the founders of the two systems on several moot points in the Vedic texts. The former seems to be a more likely hypothesis. There is another hypothesis that there were several Jaiminis and several Bädaräyanas, all writing on the Pūrva and Uttara Mīmānsā and that they were promis- cuously quoted without giving any hint as to their difference. But this seems to me quite unlikely at so early a date. The extant sūtras going under the names of Jaimini and Bãdarây ana are the final redactions of the teachings of the schools founded 14 śifófo i 5 !• 3. 31=^ąi a?d«#łllgft: wmšk i i^ft.

But as the extant Brahmasūtra con- tains words like ' taduktam ' and the extant Pūrva-mimāfisā- sūtra does not contain any allusion to the existence of a work dealing with the interpretation of the Upanishads it seems highly probable that the extant Pūrvamīmāflsā sütras are anterior to the extant Brahmasõtras. The other authorities quoted in the Pūrva-mlmāflsāsūtra are Jaimini himself ( III. 1. 4, VI. 3. 4, YIII. 3. 7, IX. 2. 39, XII. 1. 7), Âtreya ( IV. 3. 18, V. 2. 18, VI. 1. 25 ), Aitiâãyana ( III. %. 43, VI. 1. 6 ), Kãmukãyana ( XI. 1. 57 ), Kārsņājini ( IY. 3. 17, VI. 7. 35 ), Bādari ( III. 1. 3, VI. 1. 27, VIII. 8. 6, IX. 2. 33 ), Jjäbukäyana ( VI. 7. 37 ). Of these the Brahmasūtras also quote âtreya ( III. 4. 44), Bādari (IV. 3. 7, IV. 4, 10, III. 1. 11, I. 2. SO ) and Kārsņājini ( III. 1. 9. ). As Sabara15 wrote his Bhãsya at least before 500 A. D. and as he was preceded by the Vrttikāra and also by other com- mentators on the sūtras, the lowest limit to which the extant Pūrvamīmāflsā sūtras can be brought down is about 100 A. D., the highest limit being about 300 B. O. Yãjnavalkya, who is comparatively an early writer and not later than 200 A. D., mentions Mīmāfisā as one of the fourteen vidyas ( I. 3. ). If Apastamba's references are made to a sūtra on the Pūrva- mīmāflsā, then the antiquity of the Jaiminîya sūtra will be pushed back a few centuries even beyond 300 B. C, The Pūrvamīmāflsā-sūtra is divided into 12 books, each The contents of the Pūrva- mīmānsā-sūtra. book containing four pādas, except the 3rd, 6th and 10th, which contain eight pādas each. Each pāda contains several Adhikaraņas (or topics for discussion ). Popularly there are supposed to be about 1UUU adńiKaranas. ine iviimansasara- saňgraha of Śańkarabhatta attempts to make out this total, but other authorities like Mādhava calculate a smaller number than 1000. The conclusion established in each Adhikaraņa is called a Nyâya. There are roughly speaking about 2700 sūtras. It would be impossible to convey in the space at my disposal an accurate idea of the contents of this vast work. The following is a very brief resumé of the contents : - 1 I. The purpose of the work is the inquiry into what is dharma; dharma is defined as a desirable object indicated by Vide JBBRAS for 1923 pp. 83 ff. for Sabara and VfttikSra.</page><page sequence="7">Ťhe ttrva-mrnatlsU System Ý a(Vedio) injunctive passage; the connection between word and senses is eternal ; the relation of vidhi and arthavāda, the latter forming part of a connected whole and therefore being authoritative only as expatiating upon the injunctive passages; the meaning of the mantras employed in the ritual is intended tobe conveyed ; the Smrti rules like those on Astakāšrāddha are authoritative ; in a conflict between śruti and smrti , the latter is to be discarded, but if there is no conflict then smrti may be inferred to be^based on a lost śruti ; meaning of certain words borrowed from Mlecchas is the same as is conventional among the latter ; usages like the Holākā festival are authorita- tive ; grammatically correct words are to be employed and not apabhramsas like gavl for a cow ; identity of words used in the Vedas and in popular language; the primary meaning of a word is ākrti or class notion ; certain words like ' udbhid ' 'citra', 'agnihotra', 'śyena' are names (nãmadheya) of certain rites and not subsidiary vidhis; such sentences as 'the sacrificer is the prastara or yūpa ' are arthavādas and not guņavidhis ; when there is a doubt 'as to the meaning of a word, the rest of the context should be emĻ jje d for determining the meaning. II. The principal word- in an injunctive passage is the verb, which declares the result to be brought about; the performance of the acts enjoined in the Veda gives rise to an -unseen potency ( Apūrva) ; actions are either principal or subordi- date ; definition of principal and subordinate actions; illustra- tions of subordinate and principal acts; the verbs ocurring in jnantr as' do not lay;down vidhis as those in the Brāhmaņas do; definition of mantra and Brāhmaņa; definition of Rk, Sama, Yajus ; Nigadas are Yajus ; how to determine what por- tion of a Yajus constitutes one sentence ; each different verb ( like juhoti, yajeta, dadāti ) denotes a distinct act, having a separate unseen potency ; illustrations of this ; difference of acts on the ground of number, appellation ( Sañ jnā ), difference in deityî; agnihotra is prescribed as a life-long duty ; agnihotra and other rites prescribed in the several Sākhas of the Veda are not so many : d istinct rites in each Sākhā. III. The meaning of Sesa ; Sesa is that which subserves the purpose of another; not only are substances, guņa and samskāras śesa, but even rites are also śesa to the result, the result to the agent and the agent to certain acts; in such sentences as 'he cleanses the cup' the singular stands for the</page><page sequence="8">8 P. V. Kane. plural ; illustrations of śesa and áesin ( subordinate and principal ) ; the primary meaning of a word is to be taken ; means of determining the application ( viniyoga ) of texts viz. śruti, linga, vâkya, prakaraņa, sthāna, samãkhyã ; rule of decision in case of conflict between two of these principles; the prohibition of speaking falsehood in Darāa-Pūrņa-masa is a vidhi and not an anuvāda ; the prohibitions against killing or injuring a Brahmaņa are genereal and not restricted to the time of Darsapūrņamāsa ; several examples of Vedic rules that are addressed to the agent and have no relation to the sacri- ficial act (such as wearing gold) ; the procedure to be followed as regards the principal is to be followed for the substitute also ; the hiring of ritviks is to be done by the sacrificer and not by the adhvaryu and the samskāras such as shaving, paring the nails are also to be performed on him ; only he who is learned in the Vedas is authorised to perform sacrifices. IV. Inquiry into what is Kratvartha (what is enjoined for the sacrificial act, is therefore obligatory and if unperformed or badly performed will cause defect in the sacrificial act) and purusãrtha (what is addressed only td the agent, is therefore not such as to cause defect in the sacrifice, if not obeyed) ; definition of purushārtha ; illustrations of both ; the Prajāpati vow ' one should not see the sun rising or setting' is puru- sãríha ; discussion of which ,out of two substances or actions is the prayojaka ; illustrations of arthakarma and pratipatti - karma ; the Sruti texts declaring the time, place and agent of certain actions are not arthavãdas, but Niyamas (restrictive injunctions); what is the principal as opposed to the śesa so far described; the description of rewards with reference to substances, samskāras and subsidiary acts are merely artha- vãdas; the maxim of Viávajit, viz. that all such rites as Viévajit for which no reward is proclaimed by the texts have heaven as their reward ; Kãmya rites have as their reward the object desired and not svarga ; Vaišvānaresti performed on the birth of a son is for the benefit of the son and not for the father and is to be performed after jâtakarma on the full moon or new moon; the pindapitryajña is not an ańga of the nefw moon ritual.

VI. This deals with Adhilcāra. Svarga is not a dravya but is a state of bliss and is principal, while sacrifice is subsidiary to it and is a means of attaining it ; he is authorised to perform sacrifice who desires svarga ; only men (not deities nor lower animals) are authorised to perform sacrifice ; both malps and females can perform yaga ; huöband and wife are together authorised to perform yaga; but the wife has only a limited part in the yaga ; Sûçlra is not capable of performing yaga ; persons devoid of a limb or suffering ¡From incurable disease cannot perform yaga ; the rathakāra, though not of the three castes, can consecrate fire on account of a special text and so the Nisāda can perform the Raudra yãga ; in a sacrificial session (extending over a long period) each person engaged in the sattra secures the reward ; the rules about following and saluting the teacher apply only after upanayami and not before ; the paying of the three debts is obligatory on the three castes ; as regards obligatory duties they are to be performed by all but according to ability ; there is no substitute in the case of the deity, the fire, the subsidiary acts, the mantras , nor . for the sacrificer ; in the case of sattras a substitute for a sacrificer is allowed ; pray lècittas in case of total or partial breaking or spilling out or burning of substances ; sattras can be performed only by Brāhmaņas ; in the Višvajit one cannot give away one's parents, wife &amp;c., but only that over which one. has abso- lute ownership; a sovereign cannot give away the land, as it is common to all, nor horses, nor áudra who serves as a duty ; the word 'sam vat sara' means a day in the case of sacrifices prescribed for a thousand samvatsaras; the oblations to be offered by the brahmacãrin are offered in domestic fire and not in consecrated fire ; the same is the case with the sacrifice of the chief who is a nisāda ; Daiva rites are to be performed in udagayana , bright fortnight and on auspicious days. VII. This deals with the principle of Atideśa ( extension by analogy of the procedure and details of daršapūrņamāsa to other sacrifices ). The details of the daršapūrņamāsa are to be extended to all sacrifices such as Aindrāgna according to re- quirements ; Atideśa may be brought into play by express words or by implication and inference ; examples of the first, such as the extension of the procedure and details of Syena yãga to Isu yãga; Atideśa is indicated by the employment of the same 2</page><page sequence="10">10 P. V. Kané . technical term ( nāma ) in other sacrifices, such as the employ- ment of the word agnihotra in Kuņdapāyinām-ayana. VIII. This book deals with the application of the principle of Atideśa to individual cases. The rule of guidance is that those details and that part of the primary ( prakrti ) sacrifices such as Daršapūrņamāsa are to be extended, of which an indication (by words or sense ) is conveyed by the injunctive passage of the modificatory ( vikrti ) sacrifices and by other passages sub- sidiary to them ; but the reward, the agent ( desiring heaven ), the restrictive rules ( such as agnihotra for life ) and the definite collocation of actions ( such as Darša-pūrņamāsa ) are not ex- tended by Atideàa ; if there is doubt on account of the havis and the devatā pointing to the atideśa of different items, then it is the identity of havis that decides the matter; Darvihoma is an appellation and not a guņavidhi and is an appellation of both smārta rites like the Astakas and of Vedic rites. IX. This book deals with the subject of Uha ; when apply- ing the principle of Atideśa, certain alterations and adaptations are necessary in the case of mantrast sąmans and samskāras ; the various details of the Agnihotra have Apūrva as the motive of their performance ; it is the .result ( apūrva ) of the sacrificial act that is principal and not the deity and therefore it is not the deity that is the moving spring of the details of a yaga ; examples of uha ; examples of the non-application of ūha, for instance in the Jyotistoma the Subrahmanya nigada has the words ' Hariva āgaccha,* which should not be modified by Uha , when the same nigada is repeated in the Agnistut. X. This book deals with bãdha and abhyuccaya everything pertaining to the model ( prakrti ) yàga is not to be done iti the modifications of it ( vikriti ), but the technical ap- pellations, the purificatory acts and materials (of the model ļrāga) may have to be omitted in the modifications if there is no purpose to be served by employing them ; examples ; the Arambhanïya isti is not to be performed in the Dîksanlya rites, though performed in the model yaga ; in the sattras such as Dvādašāha there is no choosing the rtviks as in the Jyotistoma, nor is there engagement of services for a reward ; the word 4 šveta ' in the passage ' vãyavyam švetamālabheta 9 conveys a white goat and not any other white animal ; the oows that are the dakshiņā in the Jyotistoma should be divid- ed among the priests by the&gt; sacrificer himself ; instances of ad-</page><page sequence="11">The Pūrm-mīmārisā System. 11 dition ( samuccaya ) ; the deity must be addressed in the yaga by the appellation contained in the injunctive passage and hot by a synonym ( such as pãvaka for agni ) ; of several items mentioned in order, if only some are to be employed then those in the beginning are to be taken and not those mentioned last ; in sattras ( such as dvãdaáâha ) there are many yajamanas and not one ; the yajamanas themselves are the priests ( ritviks ) in sattras ; difference between sattra and ahina, the former being enjoined in such words as 4 āsate ' 4 upayanti ' and having many yajamanas, while in the latter the injunction is in the form * yajeta ' and the sacrificers are not many ; it is not the whole animal that is one offering ( havis ), but its various limbs are the havis ; discussion of pratisedha and paryudasa ; meaning of the negative ' naň ' ; iťis either paryudasa, or it may be mere arthavāda ( as in ' ná tau paśau karoti ' with reference to the two ãjyabhãgas ), or it may be a pratishedha ( as in 'nātirātre Sodaśinam' &amp;c. ). XI. This book deals with tàntra ad avāpa . That which is useful to many, though itself performed once, is called tantra, that which is useful to many only when repeated many times is called āvāpa ; the principal items such as Âgneya &amp;c. in the daršapūrņamāsa have svarga as the fruit in their entirety and there is no separate reward for each ; the different angas of á sacrifice serve a single purpose ( viz. helping on the principal act ) and hence have a single fruit ; Kamya rites may be repeat- ed as often as desired ; those actions that are prescribed ( such as pressing or beating the grains of rice ) and have a seen result are to be repeated and continued until the result is accomplish- ed, while those actions that have only an unseen result are not to be repeated ; such aňgas as prayajas are to be performed only once ; the Kapiñjala maxim viz. the plural stands fo* three in the absence of anything to the contrary ; the time, place and the priests are to be the same in the case of the principal rites, Ãgneya and others ; examples of arthakarma and prati- pattikarma ; ādhāna ( consecration of fires in spring, summer, autumn according to caste ) is to be done only once and not repeated with each isti, paśuyaga, somayâga &amp;c. ; the utensils of sacrifice are to be kept till the death of the sacrifieer, as the sacrificer is to be cremated with them ( so this is a pratipatti- karma of the utensils ). XII. This book deals with the topic of prasanga , which paeans ( the undesirable ) possibility of certain items belonging</page><page sequence="12">12 P. F. Kane. to one act having to be employed or performed in another act. In the chapter about Agnisomïya paáu, a paśupurodaśa is laid down, with reference to which a doubt arises whether the seve- ral aůgas of the paśuyaga are to be repeated with the purodāša also ; the answer is no ; when there is an aggregate of sevaral contradictory dharmas, the majority is to be followed ; if there are several things, each serving the same purpose ( as rice and yava ), then there is an option ; there is an option as to the prayaścittas to be performed for doing something through mistake or heedlessness, but all prayaścittas prescribed on an occasion other than the above are to be performed together; the rules about not reciting the Vedas ( anadhyãya ) apply to the study of the Vedas and not to the repeating of Vedic texts in sacrifices ; actions are to be performed after the mantras appro &gt; priate to them are repeated ( as in ť ise tvā ' iti *chinatti ) ; there is no option as to hautra mantras ; mere japa mantras no- connected with any rite, mantras containing praises, blessings and appellations or invokations. areto be added up (theieis samuccaya and not vikalpa); in a sattra such purificatory acts as añjana are to be done by all sacrificers ; only Brāhmanas can officiate as priests. Hardly anything is known about Jaimini. There is a Personal History of Jaimini. Brāhmaņa, a Śrauta sūtra and a Grhyasütra ast cribed to Jaimini. But it is hardly likely that they are the works of the founder of the Pūrva- mīmānsā. In the tarpaņa in the Ãávalãyanagrhya ( III. 4. 4 )16 Jaimini occurs along with Sumantu, Vaiáampâyana &amp;c. In the Bhāgavatapurāņa ( XII. 6. 75 ) Jaimini is said to be the teacher of Sumantu and a promulgator of the Sāmaveda. The Pañchatantra tells us that an elephant crushed to death Jaimini, the author of the mīmānsā. Jaimini seems to have been a writer of northern India. He is familiar with Mleccha words according to Sabara and speaks of an inhabitant of Mathurā ( I. 3. 21 ). His sūtras do not possess the compactness of even the Brahmasūtras, much less of Pāņini's. By the time of Sabara not only were there several commentaries on the sūtras, but there had arisen various readings in the sūtras17. The Tantravārtika points out that Sabara omits some sūtras of 17 «î J ficT on XI. 1. 14-15,</page><page sequence="13">The Purva - mīmāfisa System . 13 Jaimini18. One of these six sūtras not commented upon by Sabara occurs in Sankara's bhashya on Brahmasūtra (III. 4. 20 ' The Tantra vārtika remarks that Jaimini composed a few sūtras that do not contain much substance and so the bhäsyakära might have passed them over ( p. 915 J18. A few words must be said about the commentatators of Literature of the Pu i'vamīmānsā system . the sūtras and about some of the important works on the Mīmānsā. This is not the place to attempt a complete list of such works. The earliest commentator seems to be the Vrttikāra, who is frequently quoted by 'Sabara with reverence ( atra bhavān or bhagavān, II. 3. 16, III. 1. 6, VII 1. 2.), though Sabara frequently differs from him ( 1. 1. 3-5, VII. 2. 7. ) and criticizes him ( II. 1. 33 ). It is not possible to give the name of the Vrittikāra. Many Sanskrit writers like Ānandagiri iden- tify Upavarsa with the author of the vrtti. M. M. Dr. Ganga- nath Jha also does the same. But this does not seem likely. Sabara himself quotes Upavarsa in the long summary of Vrtti- kāra's views on sūtras I. 1. 3-5. Saiikara in his bhashya on Brahmasūtra ( I. 3. 28 ) quotes the same view of Upavarsa and tells us that he commented upon both the Pūrva and Uttara mīmānsā ( III. 3. 53 ). The Tantravārtika ( p. 390 on II. 1. 12 } uses the word Mahãbhãshyakãra for Upavarsa (according to the Nyâyasudhâ of Somesvara ). The Tantravārtika speaks of the Vrttikāra and bhagavān Upavarsa in the same breath and appears to distinguish them both ( p. 607 Tantravārtika on II. 3. 16 ). Hence it seems very likely that the Vrttikāra was a different person from Upavarsa. Sabara frequently proposes several interpretations of the same sūtras ( IV. 1. 2, IV. 3. 27-28, VIII. 1. 34, 39 ; VIII 3. 14-15 , IX. 1.1 and 34-35 &amp;c.) . There- fore it follows that he had several predecessors. Several other commentators of the sūtras are mentioned by other writers. Kumārila mentions Bhavadāsa (in Slokavārtika I. 93), Bhartr- mitra is said by "Nyayaratnäkara (on Slokavārtika I. 10) to have made Mīmānsā atheistic and to have composed an ancient (cirantana) commentary on the Mīmānsā sūtra, and Hari is quoted by the Sāstradīpikā (on X.2.59-60).

The information to be gathered from Sahara's bhãsya has been collected by me else- where ( JBBRAS for 1923, vol. 26 No LXXIY, Art. V). Sabara knewfcãtyãyana and also Patañjali, the metrical work of Píngala, the Pâninîya Sikshā, the Baudhãyana and Āpastamba dharma- sutras, the Manusmrti, the Mahābhārata and Purāņas, the Bauddha Sünya-väda. He is frequently referred to and criti- cized by Kumārila and is mentioned also by Sankara ( in his Bhãshya on III. 3. 53 ). He is therefore certainly later than about 100 A, D. and is earlier than 500 A. D. as the following discussion will show. About his home nothing can be said be- yond this that he seems to be an inhabitant of north India. He speaks of the Mlecchas being clever in catching and rearing birds ( on I. 3. 10 ) and speaks of the employment of the word 'rajan* by the Āndhras to a kshatriya who does not live by pro- tecting a country or a city ( on II. 3. 3 ). Tradition says that Varāhamihira, Bhartrhari, Vikrama, Haricandra, Sanku and Amara were his sons.20 According to tradition his real name was Ädityadeva, the name Sabara being due to his having pro- tected himself from Jain persecution by passing off as a forester. The Dattakamīmānsā refers to the comment of Sabara on the sūtra of Satyãsãdha Hiranyakeśin. He is probably the same as the bhãsyakãra of the Mlmānsā, Sabarasvāmin, son of Dīptasvāmin, wrote a commentary called Sarvārthalaksaņī on the Lińganuśasana ; whether he is identical with the bhãsya- kãra is doubtful. Between Kumārila and Sabara several centuries must have intervened. The former is the most illustrious writer on the Mīmānsā. Hé wrote the Slokavārtika ( on I. 1. ) and the Tantravārtika ( on L 2-III. ) and the Tup-tíkã on selected sütras of the last nine books. He is a thorough-going Mīmān- saka and his views are often diametrically opposed to those of Prabhākara. He frequently criticizes Sabara (Tantravārtika pp. 728,817,997,1127,1150 ). His remarks on the omission by the bhãsyakãra of six sūtras establish that numerous commen- taries on the sūtras and on Sahara's bhãsya intervened between Sabara and himself ( p. 915 Tantravārtika ).

Kumārila criticizes the Vâkyapadîya ( which accord- ing to the current interpretation of Itsing's words was. com- posed about 650 A. D. ) and Vācaspatimišra, who commented upon the Vidhiviveka of Mandanamiśra, pupil of Kumārila, wrote one of his works in 898 of the Vikrama era i. e. 841 A. D. Therefore Kumārila must have flourished about 750 A. D. He is according to tradition an avatāra of Kumāra or Kārti- keya ( probably his name suggested the idea ). He seems to have been an inhabitant of the Tamil or Malayalam country in south India, as he mentions many words ( p. 157 Tantravārtika) in these dialects, though he seems to have been familiar with the popular dialect of Lata (district round modern Surat, p. 200, p. 989 ). Kumārila is often referred to as Bhattapāda (as done by Medhātithi) or simply Bhatta by later writers and his followers are styled Bhāttas. Prabhākara ( also called Guru ) wrote two commentaries The School of Prabhākara. on the Bhâsya, of Sabara, one a large one called 'Brhatī' and the other amore concise one called 'Laghvï' ( vide Trantrarahasya of Ramānujācārya published in Gaik wad's Oriental Series). A ms. of the Brhatï is in the possession of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and in the colophons in that ms. only the name Prabhākara occurs and not Guru. M. M. Dr. Jha (Prabhākara School p. 9 ) suggests that the epithet c guru ' was applied to him by way of deprecating his elaborated or complicated views. It is not unlikely that the name stuck to him on account of his pupil Sälikanätha having frequently referred to him as simply ' guru ' in his works21 ( vide Prakaraņa-panchikā p. 12, 44,126, 201 ), although he generally styles him Prabhākara-guru ( pp. 1, 13, 32, 170, 171, 196, 202 ) and sometimes as Prabhākara ( p. 17, 197 ). Sālikanātha speaks of his master's followers as 4 Prābhākarāh ' ( Prakaraņa- p. p. 74, 141, 188 ). He was called Nibandhanakāra by later writers ( vide Sāstradīpikā on II. 1. 1 and the Candrikā comment on Prabodhacandrodaya II. 3 ). The relation of Prabhākara to Kumārila is a controver- sial matter. According to tradition Prabhākara was a pupil of Kumārila. This tradition is supported by the Sarvasiddhànta- 21 4 p. 12.</page><page sequence="16">16 P. V. Kaneś saůgraha attributed to Saikarächärya.22 On the other hand, Dr. Jha is of opinion that the internal evidence of the works of the two great protagonists is against this and that Prabhā- kara is earlier than Kumārila. There can be no doubt that they are very near each other in age. Sālikanātha was a pupil of Prabhakara. He also quotes and criticizes the Ölokavärlika of Kumārila ( e. g. Sloka. I, 11 is quoted on p. 5, Sloka. Abhãva section, verse 28 on p. 122 of the Prakaraņa-panchikā and Sloka, arthāpatti verse 21 on p. 114 of Prakaraņap). Therefore both Kumārila and Prabhakara were contemporaries. According to the Nyãyaratnãkara, Kumārila actually refers to Prabhakara (vide note 49). Apart from other grounds of proof, the difference in style between Prabhakara and Kumārila noted by Dr. Ganganatha Jha has nothing to do with difference in age in this case and the florid language of the latter and the simple but incisive style of the former are mere peculiarities of individual authors due to their difference of capabilities and difference in command over polemical language. It is not unlikely that Prabhakara might have been the older of the two. In the Prabodhacandro- daya ( II. 3 ) four great writers on the Pūrvamīmānsā are arranged as follows Guru, Kumārila, Sārika ( i. e. Salika- nātha ) and Vācaspati.23 Evidently the last three are arrang- ed according to priority in time and hence we shall not be far wrong if we assume that Prabhakara was a little older than Kumārila. The Prabodhacandrodaya was written between 1050 and 1116 A D. (Epl. Ind. vol. I. p. 220). Prabhâkara's work and his school sank into unmerited oblivion probably owing to the brilliance of his great rival Kumārila. Still in early works he is often referred to e. g. the Mitāksharā (on Yaj. II. 114 ) quotes the words of Guru in connection with the question whether ownership is laukika ,24 It appears that in nooks and 22 Vide I. 18-19 rfafamfifo W!f it ng.

' It seems that Prabhākara was preceded by a Vārtikakāra whose views were the starting point for the school of Prabhākara. The Prakaraņa-pan chikā quotes with respect a Vārtikakāramisra (p. 3). This writeť is different from Kum arila, in whose works the quotations are not found, Kumārila in his Tantravārtika ( p. 606 ) seems to refer to á Vārtikakāra who came after the Vrttikāra and probably be* fore the Bhãsyakâra Sabara25. It is probably owing to this that Kumārila's works are designated Sloka vārtika and Tantra- vārtika to distinguish them from the older Vãrtiká. The important works of the Prabhākara school may be, mentioned here in one place* On the two commentaries of Prabhākara called Brhati and Laghvī, Sālikanāthamišra ( as he calls himself in Prakaraņapanchikā p. 38 ) wrote two com- mentaries respectively named Rjuvimalā and Dīpasikhā ( vide Tantrarahasya and the commentary Candrikā on Prabodha- candřodaya II. 3 ' Sālikanātha also wrote an independent work called Prakaraņapancikā (published in the Chaukhambâ series ) which deals with certain important points, such as thé purpose of the Mīmānsā áãstra, the pramāņas, knowledge and its self-authoritativeness, nature of the soul &amp;c. He quotes Dharmakīrti's definition of pratyaksha (p. 47 of Prakaraņa - p. )¿ He flourished after Kumārila i. e. after about 750 A. D. Dr. Keith ( Karmamīmānsā p. 9 n. 2 ) is wrong in placing him. before Kumārila. The same learned author says that the Pra- karaņapanchikā uses Uddy otakara, but the page of the former work (44) to which he refers contains only the definition of pratyaksha given by Gautama and its explanations by otheis. Bhavanātha wrote the Nayaviveka, which summarises the two' commentaries of Sālikanātha and his Prakaraņapanchikā. This&gt; Bhavanātha is quoted by the Smrticandrikã (about 1200 A, P.); on the question of the son's ownership by birth in ancestral property. The commentary Candrikā on the Prabodháòan- drodaya (II. 3) says that Mahodadhi was a fellow-student of Sārikanātha and wrote an independent work on Prabhākara's views.

The Slokavārtika was com- mented upon by Pārthasārathimišra, the com- mentary being called Nyâyaratnâkara (pub- lished in the Chaukhamba Series) and by Sucaritamiára in his Kãáikã. Pārthasārathimisra is earlier than# Mādhava. Pārthasārathi also wrote three other works, the Sāstradīpikā (commentary on the sūtras of Jaimini, pub- lished by the Nirnayasägar Press), the Tanbraratna (explanation of important points occurring in the sūtra and bhãsya) and the Nyāyaratnamālā (published at Benares), an independent work on the Mímañsa commented upon by Rāmānuja (not the founder of the Visistādvaita school) in his Nâyakaratna. The Slokavārtika seems also to have been commented upon by Bhattombeka, a pupil of Kumārila. The Yuktisnehaprapûranî, a commentary on the Sāstradīpikā (Nim. Ed.), quotes a few words of Bhattombeka on the first verse of the Slokavārtika.26 A ms. of the Mālatī-Mādhava attributes the drama to Umbekãcârya, the pupil of Kumārila (Pandiťs Intro, to Gaudavaho p. 206). Vide also Chitsukhî (p. 265 Nim. Ed.) for the identification of Umbeka with Bhavabhūti made b j the commentator (who flourished in the 14th century).27 Umbeka's work has recently been unearthed. The Tantravārtika has been commented upon by Somešvara, son of Mahādeva, in his Nyâyasudhã also styled Rāņaka (published at Benares). Somešvara is at least earlier than 1500 Á. D., as he is quoted in the Dvaitanirnaya of Saùkarabhatta and as a ms. is dated 1440(Samvat or Saka ?). The Tup-tīkā of Kumārila was commented upon by Someávara ín his TārJcikābharaņa and by Yenkatesvaradlkshita in his Vārtikābharaņa.

Bhavadeva was eulogised for his profound knowledge of Mīmānsā and Jyotisa in an inscription from Rādhā in Bengal (Epl. Ind. Yol. VI. p. 203 ff). Bhavadeva (about the second half of 11th century) wrote a work called Tautātitamatatilaka* and also a commentary on the Tantravārtika.27* The Jaiminīyanyāyamālāvistāra o.' Mādhava (Ānandāšrama, Poona) gives the contents of the several adhikaraņas of the Mīmāfisāsūtra in kārikās and brief prose explanations. Appayyadïkshita wrote the Vidhirasãyana (published at Benares). Sańkarabhatta finished a commentary on the Sāstradīpikā begun by his father Nârãyanabhatta, also wrote the Mīmānsāsārasangraha (Chaukhamba Series), the Mi- māfīsābālaprakāša ( Chaukhamba Series ) and the Vidhi- rasãyanadusana refuting the work of Appayya. The Māname- yodaya (Trivandrum Series) gives Kumārila's views on the nature of proof and qudtes the Brhatī, Sālikanātha and several other authors. Khaņdadeva (who died in 1665 A. D.) wrote the Bhāttadīpikā (published in the B. I. Series) and the Mlmãflsã- kaustubha. The Bhāttacintāmaņi of the famous Gāgābhatta who officiated at the coronation of the great Sivaji is a very learned work. Two more works dealing with the technical terms of the Mīmānsā and important points of dogma are the Artha- sangralia of Laugãksi Bhã skara (printed in the Benares Series and translated by Dr. Thibaut) and the Mīmāfīsānyāyaprakāša of Apadeva. The Pūrvamīmānsā is one of the six orthodox darśanas (or The Important doctrines of the Pūrvamīmānsā. systems of philosophy), the other five being Sãókhya, Yoga, Nyãya, Vaišesika and Vedānta. It has to be seen what contribution the Pūrva- mīmānsā makes to the philosophy of India and how far its claim to be called a system of philosophy may be justified. Ifc is not possible to enter here into all the numerous ramifications of the Mīmānsā down to the latest times. An attempt will be made to collect together the most striking of the dogmas of the system, as gathered from the Sūtra itself, the bhãsya of Sabara, the works of Kumārila and of Prabhākara 7a Vide M. M. Chakravarti in JÀSB 1912 pp. 332-348 for Bhavadeva and JÁSB, 1915 p. 312,</page><page sequence="20">gQ~ P. V, Kané, and his dírecť followers, without setting out in detail the pro- cesses of reasoning by which those dogmas were established. The purppse of the Pūrvamīmāīīsā is the inquiry into dharma ąs opposed to the purpose of the Vedānta, which is to investigate into the nature of brahma , The Mīmānsā defines dharma to be those duties that are prescribed by injunctive passages which urge men to action.28 The next question is wļiafc is the source of these injunctions. The answer is that it is the eternal, infallible and self-existent Veda and not pra- tyaksha. It is this theory that the Veda has existed from all eternity, was not created by any person, human or divine, that is the point of the whole system. According to the Vedānta the Veda proceeds from the omniscient Brahma?* According to Patañjali the order of the letters of the Veda is not eternal, though the meaning is so. The Veda being infallible and eternal, it is the final authority as Sabara says.29a Jaimini enters into elaborate arguments to establish the nityatva of Veda. As a corollary he has also to argue that the relation between word and sense is eternal. But the mass of the Veda is vast and so Jaimini divides it into five heads, Vidhi, Pratisedha ( prohibition ), Arthavāda (expatiatory or commendatory texts), Nâmadheya (mere appella- tions like Śyeną &amp;c.) and mantras (that do not lay down vidhis, but are recited at the time of performing the several parts of a yaga). It is therefore Vidhis alone that lay down dharma. Vidhis are classified from various standpoints, such as vidhis proper, Niyamą and Parisankhya ; again into Nitya, Naimittika and Kamya ; into Utpatti-vidhi (as in agnihotram juhoti), Viniyoga-vidhi (as in dadhnā juhoti), prayoga- vidhi, adhikāra- vidhi (as in Rajā râjasûyena yajeta) ; then again into kratvartha and purusārtha. Incidentally Jaimini recognises the binding forcé of Smrtis and usages like the Holākā, provided they are not opposed to the Veda. The reward for carrying out the injunc- tions is often declared in the injunctive passages and where it is not so declared, the reward of the performance of all duties is švarga*0 ( Višvajin-nyaya, Pūrvamīmānsā IV. 3. 15 ). One of the most important questions in any system of philosophy is who regulates the world and the rewards and punishments of the 28. *PT: i 1« 2. 29 i I. 1. 3. 29* 1^5? 3Tlf Wöni; i on III, 2. 35. 30 : i</page><page sequence="21">The Pūrm-mīmarisa System . 21 good and evil deeds of men. The answer of the Mímañsa on the latter point is that it is not God or the deity of a sacrifice that gives the reward, but that it is the Âpûrva (an invisible potency) produced by the acts performed that gives the reward31. The views of Jaimini and his followers as regards the deity are startling in the extreme. Jaimini's position is that the deity in a sacrifice is only secondary ( it is guņa ), that havis is more important than the devota in case of a conflict between the two32. The Yeda connects a deity with the sacrificial act and the offering is directed to be made to a deity. Therefore the agent has to do all that. But the deity does not enjoy the havis, the deity has no body, the sacrifice is not intended to please the deity, the deity is not lord of all things, it does not bestow favours and the fruit of the sacrifice does not proceed from the deity. These are the conclusions that follow from Jaiminťs sūtras ( IX. 1. 1-10 ) and the bhâsya of Sabara thereon, In another place, it is said by Sabara that the devatās connected with sacrificial acts are not those described in itihãsa and purānas as the denizens of heaven, but are those that have sūktas ( Yedic hymns ) addressed to them and those to whom havis is ordained to be offered33, that the Devatā is a mere means ( sādhana ) in a sacrifice, that the devatā of a sacrifice is really a matter of words, and that where the havis is prescribe ed for Agni, a synonym for Agni such as Pāvaka or Suchi cannot be employed. The views of Prabhãkara and Kumārila are the same. Their remarks about the nature of the deity are more or less destructive of the popular views on the sub- 31 3TOW i II. 1« 5. says 3?^ m&gt; I ar^ ïïïï 3T1W- ftpKfà i fčTwr ft i irot i ^ o5 +i tlící I čT^l^cHT^črtí^ I The Brahmasūtra (III. 2. 40 âfàPkcT ^ ) refers to this view of Jaimini.

Kane . jecí:, but there is much vagueness left about their positive atti- tude about the deity. 34 Another important question which all philosophy has to tackle is that of the creation of the world. Here also the atti- tude of the Mīmānsā borders more or less on atheism. Both Prabhākara and Kumārila deny the existence of a personal God who created the world or that by God's will movement was produced in the atoms and the world was produced ( as the Vaiáesikas think ).35 Their position is that the world is without beginning and not created and that the Veda is not created by God but is self-existent. They practically deny the existence of an intelligent and omniscient creator and the periodic production and dissolution of the world. It is this attitude towards the creator, towards the creation of the world and the self-existence of the Veda independently of any author, human or divine, that earned for the Mīmān- sakas the notoriety of their being atheists.36 Kumārila himself admits that the Mīmānsā was brought to the level of the lokayata view ( rank atheism that denied God and soul, that denied that any actions were morally good or evil or yielded good or evil results and so forth) by some of his predecessors and that his endeavour would be directed to bring it on to the path of belief ( in moral good or evil ). This topic of God and the creation of the world naturally introduces the topic of the existence of the individual self (atman). It is worthy of note that Jaiminťs system contains no sütra or sūtras establishing the existence of a soul.

Though Jaimini is silent, Sabara enters into an elaborate argument about the existence of the soul independent of the body, the senses and the cognitions of pleasure and pain &amp;c. (pp. 18-24 of the B. I. edition). The position of Prabhākara and also of Kumārila is that the souls are many ( in the several bodies ), they are different from the body, the senses and buddhi, but they are all-pervading and eternal.38 It is this tenet of the existence of individual souls that refutes according to Kumārila the charge of atheism brought against the Mīmāīisā.39 It is in this connection worthy of note how emphasis is differently laid on different parts of the Veda by the ritualists and the Vedāntins. According to the former, the purpose of the Veda is to ordain the performance of actions or works and therefore the only utility40 of the Upa- nisads (that speak of the knowledge of the self and its relation to Brahma ) is to give information about the agent of the actions enjoined by the Veda and the knowledge contained in the Upanisads has [no independent purpose of its own. The Vedāntin on the other hand says that the Veda which lays down works ( Karmamārga ) is only apara vidyã, that the path of works is only a preparation for the path of higher knowledge and that the knowledge of brahma has an independent purpose of its own ( as expressed in the words ' brahmavidāpnoti param * or ' brahma veda brahmaiva bhavati ' ). Both Prabhākara and Kumārila speak of moksha, but their idea of it is entirely different from that of the Vedāntin, who says moksha follows when avidya vanishes. According to Prabhākara41 moksha is the absolute cessation of body due to 38 Vide snpwn%ir pp* 141 £E for 3łiw&lt;i*ci. 1 TH*r sttwj ftssfcr- 1 Wã II ' M- p. 1^1 ; ^miicčr&lt; 1^689-724 ( anemię ) 4 *ïïri*lht&gt;*WNIcîï flar- tfiïïiïh 3^ i ępr: Śtę^cT II ' ( verse 73 ). 39 I^ttq qrftd^PKi^R^rcqnîêTêît sffa: smfcf II 3łiwqr&lt;ę 148. 40 Qffiïï j^ìcÌM IcffiMldM I4*Ì^I&lt;UÌÌM I cimeli lai P* 13» 41* Vide m+&lt;uNÍ3h&gt;i pp. 154-160. 1 STčft i ^ f^íl.i w&lt;*feítfčí*5 Jmtcil« mĶ Îttïïf I •••••• ^ issata &lt;*3*1 TcRîft ffr^Rfť%3t * nwwìd- ir6f¿4í^r i ' ^wr. pp. 166-157.</page><page sequence="24">U P.

Practically the same view is held by Kum arila who says that such Upanisad passages as ' the soul must be known ' ( Brhadäranya II. 4. 5 ) are not enjoined for securing the reward of moksha , but the knowledge of the self is the means of inducing men to engage in sacrificial rites and that the reward which is pronounced in the Sruti ( the Upanisad) from the knowledge of the self is a mere arthavāda 42 and is not an independent reward distinct from svarga (vide also rãtrisattranyâya, IV. 3. 17-19 ). Certain other important tenets of the Pûrvamîmânsâ may be briefly noticed k&lt;*re. According to the Pūrvamīmārīsā all cognitions are prima facie valid ( svatahpramāņa ) and their invalidity has to be established by other means. This view is opposed to that of the Sankhyas who hold that both validity and invalidity do not require other means to establish them, to that of the Naiyayikas who hold both as dependent on other means and to that of the Bauddhas who hold that invalidity is self- evident ( i. e. all cognitions are prima facie invalid ), while validity has to be established.43 Another tenet of the Mîmânsâ is that the principal part of a sentence is the verb ( II.

The PūrvamīmāRsā declares that jāti (class) is the primary meaning of words ( I. 3. 33 ),44 as opposed to the gram- marians who held jati, dravya , guņa or kriya to be the import or to the older Naiyãyikas who held the individual as charac- terised by the jāti as the import. Jaimini nowhere enters upon an investigation of 'the means of proof (pramāņa), though he defines pratyaksha and here and there speaks of anurnāna. The Vrttikãra ( p. JO of Sabara'« bhãsya) refers to the six pramāņas, prátvaksha, anumania, upamāna, śabda, arthāpatti and abliâva o* antipalabdhi. The Pūrvamīmānsā elaborated a special method of investi- gation, the results of which were embodied in adhikaraņas ( i. e. heads of investigation ). The constituent parts of an adhikaraņa are five, viz. the Visaya (i. e. the text or subject for discussion and investigation ), thè doubt ( vièàya ór sam- śaya ), the põrvapaksha ( the plausible view of the matter )f the refutation (uttara) of the pürvapakshä and the siddhänta ( the authoritative conclusion ).

(2) According to Kumārila, the second sūtra meets the position that dharma cannot be defined and expressly declares "a good definition of dharma and also implies that in the Veda we have the valid means of the knowledge of dharma ; Prabhãkara says that the first sūtra having declared that the investigation of dharma should follow the study of the Veda, that the mean- ing of the whole Veda is intended to be expressed, and that therefore the word dharma might comprehend the whole Veda, this sūtra declares that the Veda meant here is not the whole of it ( including mere arthavādas and mantras) but only the Injunctive parts of it that speak of something to be done ( kâryarûpa as opposed to siddharūpa ).46 (3) Prabhãkara holds the view of Anvitābhidhāna i . e . words convey a sense only when joined together in a sen- tence ; while Kumārila holds the view of Abhihitanvaya i. e . words have each an independent meaning of their own and then are joined in a sentence and convey the mean- ing of the sentence as a whole. (4) Prabhãkara 47 recognises only five pramāņas, omitting aJbhāva , while Kumārila takes the pramāņas to be six. (5) They differ on the question of Arthāpatti. Kumā- rila48 gives ť fat Devadaťta does not eat by day ' as an ex- ample of Srutârthãçatti, but the Prābhākaras do not accept that it is Srut arthāpatti.49 (6) The views of Prabhãkara and Kumārila nn many individual adhikaraņas differ considerably; vide for example the Jaiminlya^nyâya^mãlâ-vistâra on I. 2. 19-25 ( vidhiva- nnigadādhikaraņa ), I. 3. 24-29 ( Sadhu-śabda-prayukty-adhi- karana ), I. 3. 31-35 ( Ãkrtyadhikarana ), I. 4. 2 ( Udbhidā- 46 Vidé Jaiminīya-nyāyamāiāvistāra pp. 14-17 (Anandaśrama ed.)* 47 Vide pp. 13-I6. 48 Vide *dH,cjiíc&amp; pp. 473-492; p. 44 and pp, 118-124,. pp. 129-132. 49 Vide *&lt;Î|cHiî3V on 3T*tf&lt;n% verses 51-60, pp. 116-118.

Although the Pūrvamimānsā has not much to teach and MīmSfīsā rules of Interpretation. does not rise to any high level on the burning questions of philosophy such as the creation of the world, a personal god, the moral government of the world, on the soul, yet it has considerable claims to be regarded a system on account of its peculiar doctrines about the eternity of the Veda, its doctrine of works, its theory about the import of words and sentences and its peculiar method of argu- mentation. There is besides another matter which entitles thè mīmānsā system to respect. It has elaborated rules of thè in- terpretation of texts that are of permanent value. These rules were not confined to the interpretation of Yedic texts only. They were transferred to the sphere of dharmaśastra and became the guide in determining the every day religious observances of the people and their civil rights and duties in various matters such as inheritance, adoption, partition &amp;c. It is therefore advisable here to say ą few words about the rules of the interpretation of Vedic texts. Broadly speaking, the rules of interpretation fall under two heads, general and special. The rule that only vidhis have special authority and that artha- vādas are authoritative only in so far as they form one syntac- tical whole with the vidhis is an example of the formet The distinction between a pure vidhi, a niyąmą and ą parisaùkhyâ is another general rule. The rule that in determining the ques- tion as to what is principal and subsidiary ( śesa and śesin ) the six principles of sruti ( express declaration ), liiiga (implica- tion from words), vâkya ( syntactical connection), prakaraņa ( subject matter or context ), sthāna ( order or position ), samä- khyä ( name ) come into play and in case of conflict between any two of these, each succeeding one is less powerful than each preceding one ( III. 3. 14 ), is a general one. The maxim that the text ' in the viàvajit ( the sacrificer ) gives every- thing ' prescribe the bestowal of such objects only over which one has absolute ownership ( VI. 7. 1-2 ) is an example of a special rule. So are the maxims of ratrisattra ( IV. 3. 17-19 ), of Syena being merely the name of a sacrifice ( I. 4. 5 )*</page><page sequence="28">Ž8 P. F. Kane, . Many of the rules of interpretation arrived at by Jaimini pompare most favourably with the rules of the interpretation of statutes laid down in modern times by standard authors like Maxwell and correspond to some of the provisions of the Indian A cts. The first rule of the interpretation of statutes is that words and sentences must be construed in their ordinary and natural meaning i. e. the plain, literal meaning of words and sentences. This is the same as the principle of śruti. Another rule is that a construction which would leave without effect any part of the language of a statute should be rejected, unless justified by adequate grounds, such as the history or causes of the enactment or the- context (Maxwell, 6th ed. p. 33). Practically the same rule is conveyed by the doctrine that looks upon all aEthavádas as expatiating upon or recommending the vidhis after whioh they occur in order to avoid the consequence of looking upon them as useless ( Purvam. I. 2. 1 and 7 ). Another rule of interpretation is that all the parts of a statute are to be construed together- and each part is not to be construed separately and that where there is a doubt about the meaning of the words Qf ą statute they are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject of the enactment ( Max- well p. ^5 ). The same rule is evolved by Jaimini (in 1.4. 29).80 Maxwell ( p. 296 ) lays down that conflict between statutes is not to be too readily assumed and that examples of conflict may be apparent only* asthe objects of the statu tes may be dif- ferent and the language of each is therefore restricted to its. own object or subject. The same rule is laid down in the Mlmâôsãr that an option is to be declared only in the last resort (as inr the sentences 4 one should sacrifice with rice or yavasl or the sentences 4 he takes the Sodaśin cup,' 'he does not take* the Sodaśin cup), and that in other cases allot- ting; particular texts to particulars topics (visaya-vyavasthâ) is to be resorted1 to¿51 M the Indian General Clauses Act (No. X of 1897) it- is- enacted (in Sec. 13) that words in the singular shall include* the plural. The same conclusion is established by Jaimini (III. 1. 13-15, grahaikatvanyaya). In the sentence ' he clean ses the-graha ' (sacrificial vessel), although the singular number is. used* all vessels are to be cleansed. This illustration and the conclusion deduced therefrom are also (4 Vide n^lßV p« 90, ' ^ ii raw- anrVdftf* fhňr.i '</page><page sequence="29">The Purva- mlmWñsa By stein. 29 used in the Mlmañsa and Dharmaśastra for other purposes. It has been said above that, according to the Mīmānsā, the principal word in a sentence is the verb and that the purpose of a sentence is to lay down something to be done or brought about. Therefore the subject of which something is predicated is subordinate and hence the attributes (viéesanas) of the subject are not to be supposed to be intended as a necessary part of what is laid down as a rule or proposition in the sentence. For example, when Nãrada says that 4 the religious observances of brothers undivided are common/ the word 'brothers' being an attribute of the subject 'undivided persons' is to be disregarded and the rule applies to all undivided persons whether brothers or uncles and nephews &amp;c.52 The Mlmañsa of Jaimini shows, as compared with other works of ancient and medieval India, a liberal disposition in several special rules. In these days of agitation for the eman- cipation of women, it is worthy of note that Jaimini emphati- cally says that both males and females are authorised to offer sacrifices (VI. 1. 8), that women could not be objects of purchase and sale and that the words of sale employed in the Vedic texts (as in ' that woman who being bought by her husband consorts with other males &amp;c.') are used merely symbolically and figuratively (VI. 1. 15), that in ppite of passages like Manu IX. 416 denying wealth to wife, son and slave, women are en- titled to some special wealth according to the Vedic texts (VI. li 16), that husband and wife are together to offer sacrifices (VI. 1. 17). Jaimini, it is true, does not allow Sūdras to perform Vedic sacrifices (VI. 1. 25-38), bui he places it on the ground of there being no Vedic text authorising them to do so (and not on the ground of inferiority or any other, similar ground). Still even in those days Bādari pleaded that Sūdras were authorised even for Vedic sacrifices (VI. 1.27). It is further interesting to observe that the rathakãra (who did not belong to the higher three castes) was authorised to consecrate sacred fires ( VI. 1. 44^50 ) and that the chief who was a Nisāda?»55 though of a mixed caste, was entitled to offer Raudrayâga. (VI. 1. 51). This maxim of the chief who is a nisãda has been used by the Vyavahâramayukha to lay down that even a Sõdra 52 Vide ( Mandlik'fl edition, p. 50 ).

Kane . can adopt and have the homa with Vedic mantras performed through a Brāhmaņa, as against the views of some very ortho- dox purists like the author of the Suddhiviveka that the Sūdra cannot adopt because he cannot offer a homa with Vedic mantrai that is necessary for adoption. The Bhatta family of Benares to which Nīlakaņtha belonged had made Mīmāfisā and Dharmasāstra its special study and members of it held liberal views in allowing female heirs like sisters to take a high place as heirs, in allowing even a married man to be adopted, and in crowning Sivaji and so on. The Mlmānsā (VI. 7. 3) lays down a very important prin- ciple that even a sovereign ruler is not an absolute owner of his kingdom and cannot make a gift of it, as others have rights in land.84 This compares most favourably with the assumption of absolute ownership in all lands and water contained in section 37 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code. The Mīmānsā rule is used by the Vyavahäramayükha for laying down that ordina- rily the king is entitled only to the tax on land and not to the land itself.55 The Vyavahära-mayükha, relying upon another rule of the Mlmañsa that a man could not make a gift of his kith and kin in the Visvajit sacrifice (where everything was to be given away) as he has no ownership in them, says that there is no ownership over one's wife and children.56 When Smrti texts multiplied and it was found difficult to Mlmlnsä rules and their appli- cation to Dhar- masāstra. interpret them, the writers of nibandhas on dharma naturally turned to the Mīmāftsā, which had already evolved elaborate rules of the inter- pretation and application of texts and 4;he logic of the Mimáñsa became the logic of the Dharmasāstra. The words vidhiy niyma, parsańkhya , arthavãda are employed at every step by the commentators of works on Dharma , such as Medhâtithi, Vijñaneávara and others. For example, the Mitāksharā enters into an elaborate discussion on Yajñavalkya I. 81, whether it is a vidhi, niyma , or parisańkhya. Similarly the Mitāksharā and other works use the term Arthavāda and one of its varieties anuvãda very frequently. For example on 54 *r spi » ( Maudlik p. 32 ). 56 »rrckt irengröfsrö čt ņmņ i ( Mandlik p. 32 ). This yiew seems to be opposed to the Mitāksharā on Yaj.

II. 21 the Mitāksharā says that thè verse 'one should kill without deliberating ( whether one should do so or not ), even a guru , a child, an old man or a learned Brāhmaņa, if he comes as an ätatäyin' is merely an arthavada (and not a positive command, vidhi ) employed to expatiate upon or recommend the rule contained in the words 'arms should be resorted to by a dvijãti where dharma is obstructed, in self-protection, in pro- tecting cows, and in battle &amp;c.' Sankha says 'while the father is alive, the sons must not divide the inheritance, even what they acquired after (their birth) ; the sons are incompetent (to divide in their father's life-time) as they have no independ- ence in matters of wealth and dharma .' The Vyavahârama- yõkha explains that the latter parťof this text about the son's lack of independence is only an arthavāda put in for the pur- pose of extolling the prohibition (against division in the father's life-time) contained in the first part.57 Therefore Prof. Keith is not quite accurate when he asserts58 ' the term Arthavāda, which plays so important a part in theMimānsā discussion, is dropped in legal terminology.' It has been explained ahove that krat- vartha vidhis are those which are of absolute obligation, the non-observance of which makes the sacrifice itself defective, while purusārtha vidhis are those that are addressed rather to the conscience of the agent aixd if not observed do not affect the sacrifice, but simply invite censure or blame on the agent. This important distinction is taken oveT in the Dharmasāstra. Yãjnavalkya (I. 53) says that one should marry a girl who is free from disease, who has a brother and who is not of the same gotra or pravara (as the bridegroom). The latter portion is kratvartha , while the first two are purusārtha , as the Mitāksharā says that there is no relation of husband and wife established in the case of a sapiņda% saj etra or sapravara girl i. e. the marriage itself is invalid and null and void, while in marrying a girl who is diseased the marriage is valid, but the man incurs blame.59 Manu says (IX. 168) 'that is to be known as the son adopted whom the mother or father might give with water in distress &amp;c.' The Mitāksharā says (on Yāj. II. 128-132) that as the word 'distress' is specifically mentioned, a son is not to be 67 ( Mandlik p. 31 ). 58 Karma MīmānaS p. 99. fàíta W I ; compare ( Mandlik p. 39 ).</page><page sequence="32">%% P. V. Kane . given when there is no distress and that this prohibition affects the giver (but not the act of adoption) i. e. it is purusSrtha Bnd not kratvartha.60 Similarly the Mitãksharã says that the words of Yajñavalkya (II. 118) ' whatever else is acquired by a man himself without detriment to the paternal estate* are śesa ( are to go with or *&gt;re subsidiary ) to each of the four fol- lowing clauses. In this he uses the language of the third book of Jaimini ( about śesa and śesin ). The Mlmānsā relies upon krama as a means of determining the relation of principal and subordinate and the application of texts. It lays down that in some cases the mere order of words ( pāthakrama ) has to be followed ( Y. 1. 4. ) and sometimes the natural sequence of objects or actions has to be followed and not the mere order of the words ( V. 1. 2 ), which has in such cases to be reversed. Both principles are followed in the legal literature. For example, in laying down the principle of preference among bandhus who are of three sorts mentioned one after another ( viz. Ätma- bandhus, Pitrbańdhus and Mātrbandhus ), Nllakaņtlia says that the order depends upon the order of the text i. e. Ãtmabandhus succeed before Pitrbandhus. But in construing the verse of Yajñavalkya (II. 137) that the heirs of the forest hermit, the sannyasin and the brahmačārin are the teacher, good pupil, and a fellow student in order, the Mitãksharã says that the order is the reverse order as common sense requires. The Mīmānsā has taken great pains to lay down rules about the meaning of the negative particle Ona*). Sometimes it is a pure prohibition, sometimes it is an exception and sometimes it is merely an arthavāda. Where there is a text laying down one thing and another equally powerful text laying down the opposite, then the text negativing what is positively laid down is a pratisedha (Pūrvamīmānsā X. 8. 6 ). An example is the text ' he does not take the Sodaśin cup in the Atirātra ' But such texts lead to option and option is a most improper pro- cedure as both texts are thereby nullified. Hence if possible the endeavour should be to explain the negative proposition as an exception ( paryudãsa ) or as an arthavāda. The Pūrva- mīmānsā (X. 8. 1^4) lays down the rule on this point of paryudãsa and gives several illustrations.61 When it is said that 1 he does not employ the words ye yajamahe in the anuyajas ' this 60 Vide vmwça ( Mandlik p. 39 ) spí T ąwr ifà i era* &amp;c. 61 X. 8. 4. 1 3 ņnņ*</page><page sequence="33">The Pūrva-mīmaTisā System . 33 is not a prohibition, but the meaning is that Ve yajamahe r are to be uttered in all cases except in anuyajas ( the negative particle being connected with anuyãjesu and not with the predicate 4 karoti ' ). In some cases a negative sentence is a mere anuvãda ( a variety of Arthavāda ) of what is well known and is put in simply to praise a vidhi or to condemn someihing other than a vidhi . For example, there is a Vedic sentence ' fire should not be consecrated on the bare ground, nor in the sky nor in heaven ' Every one knows that no one can con- secrate fire in the sky and therefore this sentence is a mere anuvãda for praising the vidhi that fire must be consecrated after placing gold on the ground. This is explained in the Pūrvamlmānsā I. 2. 5 and 18 and X. 8. 7 &amp;c. Thö Vyavaharamayükha makes use of these doctrines about paryu* dāsa and anuvãda in explaining the verse of ÎTâràda that ť a deposit, a pledge, ...son and wife &amp;c. are not to be given away &amp;c.* and the verse of Yâjfîavalkya ( II. 175 ) that a man may give without causing detriment to his family anything except Wife and child.62 A man can properly donate what he owns, but there is no ownership, as is well-known, in a deposit or in wife and children and so the prohibition only repeats what is well-known ( it is a nityãnuvada )ś Manu allows niyoga (XL 52 ff. ) and then condemns it ( IX. 64-68 ). The Mitāksharā ( on Yâj. II. 127 ) raises the question whether there is an option as Manu apparently both allows it and condemns it and answers it by saying that there is no option, but that niyoga is Condemned and the verses allowing it are to be understood in a somewhat limited sense ( as referring to the case of a maiden, who has the misfortune to lose the intended husband before actual marriage and who is then to be married to the deceased's brother ). The Mayûkha makes use of the maxim ' those that are mentioned or come without connection or invitation are to be placed at the end ' in determining the order of succession.** Manu says 4 after the mother's death, the father's mother takes the inheritance ' (IX. 217 ), while Yajñavalkya gives a compact series of heirs, the widow, daughter ( daughter's son ), mother. 62 Vide Mandlik p. 77 ' i sricfgaą il ^ i sfa arnera:' 63 Vide V« 2.19 and VI. 3. 9 aňd o» 5</page><page sequence="34">y P.

Large encroachments have been made on the old Hindu Law of the times of the Nibandhß writers by legislatiye eąąctments such as Act 21 of 1850 ( Freedom offtęligion Act ), Hindu Will? Act (Act 21 of 1370 ' Transfer of Property Act ( Açt IV of 1882), Indian Majority Act ( IX of 1875 ), Guardian and Wards Act tVIIÏ of 1890' Hindu Disposition of Property Act (XV of 1916). But this is not all. By judicial decisions professing to apply old Hindu Law to modern Hindus very large inroads have been made and some very strange results have followed. It may at ąnce be most emphątically asserted that the ' courts have made very strenuous and very honest efforts within the limitations imposed upon them by several circumstances to find out the Hiņtļu Law and apply it to the cases before them. But from the outlet tķey were handicapped by several drawbacks. Most of the judgeç even in superior courts barring a few eminent exceptions like Colebrookę and Sít George Knox were totally igno- rant of the language m which the authoritative works on Hindu Law were composed. Naturally the judges had to rely upon translations. It was rather too .readily assumed that a judge could correctly lay down ąnd administer the law by reading the translations of portions of a few Sanskrit works. In the early days of the British administration of justice only three such translations existed, viz. Halhed's Gentoo code, Sir William Jones' translation of the Manusmrti and Colebrooke's translation of the Sanskrit digest (1796 AD.) compiled by Jaga- ¿nātha. Besides these about half a dozen works were trans- lątę&lt;1 wholly or in part during the first hąlf of the 19th century ßüoh äs the Dãyabhâga, the Vyavahāiamayūkha, the Mitâk*</page><page sequence="35">The Purm-mīmaīisā System. 3$ sharä (1810 A.D. ), the Dattaka-Mīmānsā and the Dattaka-can* drikā (in j821) by Colebrooke, Borradaile, Sutherland and others. It was after 1865 that a few more works were translated such as the Dharmasūtras in the Saored Books of the East series, a portion of the Smrticandrikā by Kristnaswamy Iyer, ths Vivādacintāmaņi by P. C. Tagore, a small portion of the Vīra» mitrodaya by Sarkar. As only a few works were translated and as the judges and the legal profession were totally in the dark as to the bare outlines of the chronology of thè Hindu legal Literature and also of the Sanskrit language, strange things happened. For example, in Beni Prasad v. Hardai Bib i ( I. L. R. 14 All. p. 67) counsel gravely assured the court (|&gt;. 70) that Jaimini, the founder of the Mīmānsā, lived in the thir- teenth century of the Christian era. As the Shastris in Guzer&amp;fc frequently referred in the early British days to the Vyavahãra- mayükha that was probably introduced into Guzarat during the Maratha regime and as the work was early translated into English and thus made easily accessible to the bench and the bar it was thought that that work was of paramount authori- ty in Guzerat. As a matter of fact Nīla'kaņtha's family mi- grated from Mahārāstra, settled in Benares and he wrote his work under the patronage of a Bundella chieftain. In Chandika Baksh v. Muna Kunvar ( I. L. E. 24 All. p. 273 ) the Privy Council relying upon a wrong translation of the Vyava- hàramayûkha given by Borradaile (Stoke's Hindu Law, chap, IV, see 18, placitum 17 ) remarks that according to the Mayûkha * sons of a brother, who is dead, share along with surviving brothers ' and their Lordships proceed to say that on that point the Mayûkha only-embodied and defined a pre-existing custom®4 ( of Guzerat ), For this latter statement there is, it is sub- mitted with great respect, absolutely no basis, as the origi- nal itself has been wrongly translated. Even when the Vya- vahäramayükba was recognised as of paramount authority in Guzerat, it was not consistently followed in several res- pects such as the rule of the Mayûkha allowing the brothers of the half blood to succeed along with the father's father oř the rule allowing the adoption of a daughter's son, a sister's son or a mother's sister's son even to the three higher castes. The departure in thetlatter case was due to the opinion that the two works on adoption, viz: the Dattaka-mīmānsā and the Dat- 64 Vide Mandlik's translation of the Wayukha ( p. 81 ) for a correct renderiDg of the passage</page><page sequence="36">36 P.V.Kane. taka-candrikã, are works of the highest authority in matters of adoption and that where they differ the latter is adhered to in Bengal and by the southern jurists while the Dattaka- mīmānsā was an infallible guide in Mithilä and Benares (Bhagvan Singh v . Bhagvan Singh I. L. R 21 All. at p. 419 ; vide also I. Lē R 22 Mad. 398 at p. 411-12). A s regards the Dattaka- oandrikā, it is well-known that it was wrongly supposed to be the work of the author of the Smrticandrikā, which is authoritative in Madras and that it is suspected to have been a fabrication passed as genuine by a pandit of Colebrooke. The Mitãksharã is regarded as of the highest authority throughout India except in Bengal where the Dãyabhâga prevails. In spite of this, the highest tribunals have departed from its dootrines in allowing a coparcener to sell his share in joint family property for value without family necessity, in allowing females like the son's daughter or son's widow to succeed, in interpreting the word strīdhana whereby property inherited by a female even from a female is excluded from the incidents of being strīdhana (Sheo Shankar Lai v. Débi Sahai I. L. R 25 All. p, 468 P. 0.). The foregoing remarks are not made in a carping spirit. They have only one object in view. The present state of the Hindu Law is far from satisfactory. On the one hand the courts have, during a century or more of British rule, introduced fundamental changes in the law as laid down in the books regarded by the courts themselves to be of paramount authority. They thereby displeased the orthodox section of the community. On the other hand the courts, being bound to administer Hindu Law as laid down in the Sanskrit works of medieval India, have their hands tied down in several respects and cannot introduce modern tendencies into the teachings of ancient books.that were written from an entirely different point of view. This halting process does not satisfy those who having imbibed western jurisprudence hanker after the freedom of the 20th century in matters of marriage, succession, joint family &amp;c. The Hindu Law laid down by the courts for a century or so is imbedded in ponderous volumes of reports or in the numer- ous works on Hindu Law written by eminent lawyers. This is a very cumbrous method. Much of the substantive law ap- plicable to India is codified. Whatever might have been said against the codification of Hindu Law some sixty years ago, it is certainly high time that the codification of Hindu;Law should</page><page sequence="37">The Pūrvamīmāftsā System, 37 be taken in hand as early as possible. In the absence of codi- fication, there is great waste of the money of the litigants, there is immense loss of time and there are years of anxiety and suspense before the litigant ultimately knows his position under the Hindu Law. Codification will reduce all these evils. No one will ever say that codification is an unmixed blessing. It has always a tendency to become rigid and inelastic, it often shuts out the introduction of fresh principles and cannot pro- vide completely for the ever changing needs of a rapidly pro- gressing society. But it is the lesser of two evils and its defects can be remedied by resorting to amendments through the legislature. In the absence of codification, great uncertain- ty often prevails in matters of every day importance to the people. Even after a current of decisions has been established by decisions of the High Court for years, oases are not rare where the Privy Council makes certain observations which are supposed to overrule the long current of decisions and a crop of litigation at once springs up. This is well illustrated in two recent cases. It had long been thought that for a father's antecedent debt not incurred for an illegal or immoral purpose the whole family property ( including the son's interest ) was liable to be sold even if the father was alive. Then came the case of Sakuram, v. Bhup Singh ( I. L. R. 39 All. p. 437 ) in which the Privy Council made certain observations which were supposed to have overruled the above-mentioned long current of decisions. But recently the Privy Council restored the authority of the old rulings in the case of Brij Narain v. Mangia Prasad (26 Bombay Law Reporter p. 500 ). In the Maratha country it had been long established that a widow could not adopt, if her husband died while in a state of union and if he had not expressly au- thorised her to adopt. But the Privy Council in Yadav v. Namdeo (I. L. R. 49 Cal. p. 1.) held that in the Maratha* country a Widow can adopt without the consent of her husband s kins- men, whether the estate had vested in her or not and whether her husband was joint or separate at his death, provided he had not expressly forbidden her to adopt. Their Lordships left the question open whether, when a widow adopted without her deceased husband's kinsmen's consent in a joint family, the adopted son would be entitled to an interest in the family pro- perty. This decision has become a fruitful source of litigation. Another source of speculation in litigation is due to varying interpretations of the same Sanskrit text by the courts, though there may be no varying interpretations of commentators</page><page sequence="38">38 P. V. Kom. thereon. Manu says (IX. 142) ' the son given away (in adop- tion) shall never take the family (name) and the wealth of his natural father." In a case in I. L, R. 29 Mad. 437,. it was de. cided, following this text, that, where in a Hindu family a ¡persoti was the sole survivor and Was subsequently given in adoption in another family, he did not lose by the sub- sequent adoption the property he had already taken in the family of his birth. But in Dattatraya v. Qovind (I. L. R. 40 Bom. p. 429) it was held on a construction of the same verse of Manu that, where property had become solely and exclusively vested in a person who was subsequently adopted into another family, he became divested of that property by his subsequent adoption. With the greatest respect it is submitted that the verse of Manu cannot support the decision arrived at, on what- ever other grounds the decision may be supported. The con- struction put on Manu's verse is obnoxious to the fault called Vãkyabheda (split of sentence) in the Pūrvamīmāfisā. That fault occurs where one and the same sentence is construed as laying down two distinct rules" (vidhis). If the verse of Manu Were construed as done in the Bombay case it must be held as laying down two fules, firstly, thàt a pefson, who has already taken an estate absolutely, will, on being adopted subsequently into another family, lose what he has already taken, and secondly that ã person, who is adopted into another family, will not sub- sequently to the adoption take the wealth of any one in his natural family, if succession opens after the adoption. The construction put upon Manu's verse is further opposed to anothel' Mīmāfisa maxim that when an accomplished fact and something to be accomplished oř brought about are mentioned together in a sentence, the fact accomplished is put in simply for the purpose of what is to be accomplished or brought about." In Manu's verse the fact accomplished is adoption and it must be supposed to have been mentioned with reference to some- thing to follow in future and not with reference to something (viz. the wealth already taken) that was even prior to the 65 Vide čpítítffe p&gt; 555 T ^ maài ft VOTTfiwrrg; i.'

This is not the place to make any detailed remarks on the manner in which the codification of Hindu Law is to be brought about. It is certain that owing to serious divergences between the different schools, a. comprehensive code for the whole of India is out of question. But it is possible to codify Hindu Law by pro- vinces. When codification of Hindu Law is determined upon in order that the measure may be satisfactory to all sections, a committee must be formed, on which not only lawyers but eminent Sanskritists and students of Mīmānsā possessing a knowledge of English ( like the Hon'ble Dr. Jha ) must be nominated. We are all deeply interested in preserving and propagating Utility of the *s best in the literature and culture of Mīmānsā Vidyã- ancient India. The Mīmānsā represents a I*ya part of the valuable literature of India, The foundation of such a vidyalaya as the one declared open to-day will serve to foster the study of the Mīmānsā which has been languishing in this part of the country for lack of opportunities of study. But then some whose views are advanced might object that, granting that a study of the Mīmānsā may be embarked upon in an institution affiliated to the New Poona College, there is no necessity for making pro- vision for an agnihotra hall in these days of progress and en- lightenment. It is very easy to answer this objection. No one in these days would think of studying practical chemistry without a well-equipped laboratory or surgery without an operation room. The agnihotra hall is the laboratory of the Mímañsa. A considerable portion of the ancient works on the Mīmāfisā would not properly be understood and grasped with- out some living knowledge of the performance of the darśa- pūrņamāsa and other elementary rites. There is a further and more weighty reason. It is well-known that according to our ancient philosophy and religion there are three paths, the path of works, the path ąf devotion and faith and the path of knowledge. There are still millions in India who cherish the path of works and who regard the keeping of an agnihotra a sacred duty. As long as we do not want to abjure all our ancient philosophies and religions and to cut ourselves entirely adrift from the past, no Indian institution, claiming to teach Indian students all that is best in the East as well as in the West and to tolerate differences of opinion on religious dogma#</page><page sequence="40">40 P. F. i&amp;zrać. can afford to spurn an endowment simply on the ground that it does not appeal to a few advanced minds. In conclusion I earnestly hope that this Mīmānsā Vidyä- laya will, under the fostering care of the Sikshaņa-prasāraka- mandali, supply a long-felt want, will revive the study of the Mimañsa and will help in the solution of knotty religious, social and legal problems in the near future.67 67 The foliowidg worka, besides the originai texts referred to above, will be helpful to all students of the MîmSïïsS as they *&gt;re in English: - Colebrooke's Essays, Vol. I; Cowell and Gough's translation of the Rarvadaráana-sangraha (Trubneťs Series) ; Arthasangraha translated by Dr. Thibaut ; Sarkar's Mīmānsā rules of interpretation (Tagore Law Lectures) ; the PrābhS- kara School, the translations of the SlokavSrtika and of the Tantravārtika, by M.M.Dr. Ganganath Jha ; Prof. Keith's KarmamîmSnsS (Heritage of India Series).</page></plain_text>
