<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY: Hindkxfm and Buddhism. Philosophical Library. 1943. 86 pp. $1.75. Although this little book is divided into two parts, one on Hinduism, the other on Buddhism, the parallelism between the fundamentals is so great that only a single truth, or rather an aspect of The Single Truth, is expressed. This aspect, of course, has to do with metaphysical first principles, with which all of Dr. Coomaraswamy's recent publica- tions have been concerned. It will not be popular both because few will want to read it and because fewer will understand it, for the doctrine is, to quote from the book, "in the Buddha's own words 'hard to be understood by you who are of different views, another tolerance, other tastes, other allegiance and other training' ". The author, how- ever, is of one mind with the Indian tradition, which " is one of the forms of the Philosophia Perennis, and as such, embodies those universal truths to which no one people or age can make exclusive claim". "We shall try now", he says, "to state the fundamentals positively: not, however, as this is usually done in accordance with the 89</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 'historical method' by which the reality is more obscured than illuminated, but from a strictly orthodox point of view, both as to principles and their application; endeavouring to speak with mathematical precision, but never employing words of our own or making any affirmations for which authority could not be cited by chapter and verse; in this way making even our technique characteristically Indian". That the case has not been over- stated is proven by the citation of references to Sanskrit, Pali, Platonic, and Christian sources. The failure of previous modern disseminators of Vedic and Buddhist texts is emphasized in a statement concerning the ancient oriental attitude, as follows, "In those days it was not considered that the mere knowledge of languages sufficed to make a man a 'translator' in any serious sense of the word; no one would have undertaken to trans- late a text who had not studied it for long years at the feet of a traditional and au- thoritative exponent of its teachings, and much less would any one have thought himself qualified to translate a book in the teachings of which he did not believe". In making the comparison of Hinduism and Buddhism Dr. Coomaraswamy points out that it is not the historical life of the Buddha that is important, but the "mythical and miraculous features", in which "his personality is completely overshadowed, as he must have wished it should be, by the eternal substance with which he identified him- self. In other words, 'the Buddha is only anthropomorphic, not a man'". Elsewhere he says that "The more superficially one studies Buddhism, the more it seems to differ from the Brahmanism in which it originated; the more profound our study, the more difficult it becomes to distinguish Buddhism from Brahmanism . . . Or if we consider the miraculous life, we shall find that almost every detail . . . can be exactly paralleled- and in saying 'exactly' we mean just that-in the Vedic mythology of Agni and Indra, priest and king in divinis . . . We do not mean to deny that the Buddha's defeat of Mara is an allegory of self-conquest, but only to point out that this is a very old story, one that has always and everywhere been told; and that in its Buddhist setting the story is not a new one, but derived immediately from the Vedic tradition". Aesthetics has no place in this traditional philosophy, wherein "art is a way of life" and anything well made that needed making is an object of art, the "fine arts" of painting and sculpture being primarily for the production of icons or "supports of con- templation". The author, after giving an interesting series of the relationships between the "'halves' of the originally undivided Unity", observes that "Throughout the series (it) is the noetic principle that sanctions or enjoins what the aesthetic performs or avoids; disorder arising only when the latter is distracted from her rational allegiance by her own ruling passions and identifies this submission with 'liberty' ". Yet the basis of modern art is the freedom of the individual to express himself, that is to say, to sub- ject himself to his "ruling passions", a condition which the traditionalist cannot but view with disdain, since for him "There is, in fact, no more an individual than there is a world soul. What we call our 'consciousness' is nothing but a process; its content changes from day to day and is just as much causally determined as is the content of the body. Our personality is constantly being destroyed and renewed". And further, "Freedom is from one's self, this 'I', and its affections. He only is free from virtues and vices and all their fatal consequences who never became anyone; he only can, be free who is no longer anyone; impossible to be freed from oneself and also to remain 90</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM oneself. The liberation from good and evil that seemed impossible and is Impossible for the man whom we define by what he does or thinks and who answers to the ques- tion. "Who is that?', 'It's me,' is possible only for him who can answer at the Sundoor to the question 'Who art thou?', 'Thyself'". Ultimately, such a one gives up all material possessions and attachments and be- comes a religious mendicant. "These are those that have denied themselves and left all to 'follow Me'. . . The Hindu of any caste, or even a barbarian, can become a Nobody. These are already liberated from the chain of fate, to which only the psycho-physical vehicle remains attached until the end comes. Death in samddhi changes nothing essen- tial. Of their condition thereafter little more can be said than that they are. They are certainly not annihilated, for not only is the annihilation of anything real a metaphysical impossibility, but it is explicit that 'Never have I not been, or hast thou not been, or ever shall not be'". Continuing with the aesthetic approach, the author says, "Of all the names and forms of God the monogrammatic syllable Om, the totality of all sounds and the music of the spheres chanted by the resonant Sun, is the best. The validity of such an audible symbol is exactly the same as that of a plastic icon, both alike serving as supports of contempla- tion; such a support is needed because that which is imperceptible to eye or ear cannot be apprehended objectively as it is in itself, but only in a likeness. The symbol must be naturally adequate, and cannot be chosen at random; one infers the unseen in the seen, the unheard in the heard; but these forms are only means by which to approach the formless and must be discarded before we can become it." How different this is from the modern attempts at "self-expression", in which generally all traditional principles are violated and in which the most obvious "symbol" is the female nude, which is just that and nothing more, though it may be something less. "To do well", says Dr. Coomaraswamy, "is to do sacred things, and only to do nothing, or what being done amiss amounts to nothing, is idle and profane.... Actions, in other words, are in order or inordinate in precisely the same way that iconography may be correct or incorrect, formal or informal. Error is failure to hit the mark, and is to be expected in all who act instructively, to please themselves. Skill is virtue, whether in doing or in making: a matter needing emphasis only because it has now been generally overlooked that there can be artistic as well as moral sin". This is a very brief review of a book that is itself rigidly condensed, the author giving notes and references for those who want to look up the sources. There are many signs of careless proof-reading, a fact which is especially unfortunate where there are so many foreign words and where the author makes no statement "for which authority could not be cited by chapter and verse". I have not attempted to "criticize" the the- ories expressed, as I am far behind the author in linguistic, religious, and metaphysical knowledge, my only qualification for reviewing the book being that I believe in its teachings, which I have studied "for long years". For the benefit of those who are in- terested, it should be added that "practical advice" is given to those who choose to fol- low the path.
