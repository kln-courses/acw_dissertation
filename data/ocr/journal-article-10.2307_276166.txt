<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JAMAICA: A PRELIMINARY SURVEY ROBERT R. HOWARD JAMAICA, the third largest island in the West Indies, has probably received less ar- chaeological attention than any other island in the Greater Antilles. There are several rea- sons for this neglect. Jamaican archaeological remains are not very spectacular and offer few features to excite the interest or curiosity of the casual observer. The Jamaican Arawak were exterminated so early and so effectively by the Spaniards that they were able to contribute vir- tually nothing ethnically or culturally to the history of the island in the historic period. Perhaps because of these factors, there has never been any strongly established tradition of amateur archaeological activity in Jamaica such as has flourished for many years in Cuba or Puerto Rico, for example. Moreover, until very recently, few institutions outside of the island have taken any sustained interest in Jamaican archaeology and governmental funds and facilities for scientific investigations of all kinds have always been grossly inadequate. There are a few casual references to archae- ological discoveries in the early writings of such authors as Long (1774) but most of the finds thus described have long since disappeared. Those that have been preserved usually have little or no supplementary information accom- panying them regarding circumstances of dis- covery or context. Archaeological research, in the fullest sense of the term, was not initiated in Jamaica until the last decade of the 19th century. The two most important pioneers in this field were J. E. Duerden and Frank Cundall, both of the staff of the Institute of Jamaica in Kingston. Neither was a professional archaeologist but both were scholars of catholic interests and accomplish- ments. Duerden's monograph on aboriginal Arawak remains (1897) was inspired by the enthusiasm of Lady Edith Blake, wife of the then Governor General, who had assembled an excellent collection of pre-Columbian materials (Blake 1895) which was later purchased by the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, in New York. Lady Blake, Cun- dall, Duerden, and a few other amateurs had sponsored an archaeological exhibition at the Institute in 1895 and it was from this that the Duerden report stemmed. For its day, this compilation is an exceptional piece of work and remains the best published summary to date on Jamaican archaeology. Cundall (1894) in his research on the life of Columbus and the discovery of Jamaica was the first to realize the value of early Spanish historical accounts in reconstructing Arawak culture from the archaeological remains. Unfortunately, the efforts of these early workers did not succeed in arousing active and continued interest and relatively little was added to the basic knowledge about the island's prehistory until the last decade. During the next 30 years there were only sporadic surveys and collections made by various individuals and expeditions. R. C. MacCormack (1898) undertook several excavations in middens and caves in southern Vere and the Portland Ridge region of Clarendon in 1895. The materials he recovered formed the nucleus of the present Jamaican collections in the U. S. National Mu- seum. Additions were made to these by J. Brennan around 1900 and Gerrit S. Miller (1932) in 1931. Herbert Krieger also made collections and excavated briefly at several sites near Kingston but these have never been fully described in the literature. Reichard and Bas- tian (Reichard 1904) were the only European archaeologists of note ever to visit Jamaica. In 1904 they made surface collections and ex- plored several burial caves near Montego Bay, the materials from which now repose in the Museum fur Volkerkunde in Berlin. The col- lection of some 1500 artifacts from Jamaica now in the American Museum of Natural History was a gift from G. C. Longley (1914), a New York amateur, who had wintered on the island for 6 years. Longley dug in a number of refuse heaps near St. Ann's Bay and bought many specimens to add to his own finds. He pre- sented the total collection to the American Museum in 1914. The only major detailed excavation between 1900 and the present period was the work of Theodoor de Booy who, in 1913, did extensive digging at the Retreat property in St. Ann. His report was first published in the American Anthropologist (de Booy 1913) and later re- printed by the Museum of the American In- dian, Heye Foundation, where his materials were eventually deposited. 45</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In 1933, Marian DeWolf and her husband made test excavations at 3 sites in St. Ann parish and presented their finds and field notes to the Museum of the American Indian. Her report of the excavations (DeWolf 1953) is especially important for the description of a new pottery type unknown from other Ja- maican collections. The revival of interest in Jamaica's prehistory in the last 10 years has been due in no small degree to the activities of C. B. Lewis, Curator of the Science Museum of the Institute of Jamaica. In addition to offering facilities and expert advice to visiting scholars, Lewis has made a number of important archaeological in- vestigations himself, most interesting of which is an aboriginal burial cave near Cambridge Hill, St. Thomas. At least 3 collectors of archaeological materials are active on the island at the present time. These are Cyril Huckerby of Spanishtown, Harry Vendryes of Kingston, and C. S. Cotter of Golden Spring. Cotter, in particular, has done extensive and important work in the excavation of middens and burial caves throughout the island and has assembled an excellent representative collection of aborigi- nal artifacts. Cotter (1954) has been especially interested in the remains of the earliest Spanish settlements at Seville and other North Coast sites. The field of early historic archaeology will probably receive further investigation in the near future by parties from the University of Florida and the Institute of Jamaica. During the summers of 1947 and 1948, the author carried out a preliminary survey of the archaeology of Jamaica under the auspices of the Caribbean Program of Yale University.* A * The author wishes to express his gratitude to the staff of the Institute of Jamaica in Kingston who pro- vided every courtesy and research facility. Particular thanks must go to Eric Deuchars, Secretary of the Insti- tute, who greatly aided in the photographing of various specimens, and to C. Bernard Lewis, Curator of the Science Museum, without whose knowledge, enthusiasm, and help the work could never have been accomplished. Illustrations of specimens in the Institute collections are reproduced herewith by permission of the Board of Governors. C. S. Cotter of Golden Spring offered in- valuable assistance and information at every point. In the United States, we are especially indebted to Irving Rouse of the Department of Anthropology of Yale Uni- versity who provided insight, encouragement, and con- structive criticism in every phase of the undertaking. Finally, our thanks go to Shirley Glaser, staff artist of the Peabody Museum at Yale, who prepared the drawings for the plates which accompany the article. period totaling a little over 4 months was de- voted to an inspection of various sites and local collections throughout the island. A number of small scale exploratory excavations were also made. Various museum collections of Jamaican materials in the United States were later stud- ied and the existing literature surveyed. The present paper is largely based on the results of this study. For descriptive purposes, the archaeological sites of Jamaica may be divided into 3 main categories: (1) midden deposits or village sites, (2) caves, and (3) rock carvings or petroglyphs. At the present count, there are at least 75 midden sites definitely reported from various parts of the island, 27 caves in which aboriginal remains have been found and 9 localities where rock carvings occur. It should be emphasized that the sites enumerated are probably only a small fraction of those actually in existence either at present or in the recent past. The entire coast of Jamaica would appear to be rich in archaeological remains, a large number of which simply have never been reported. In this respect, Jamaica offers an especially fertile field for investigation. Some of the sites de- scribed by Duerden, Cundall, and other early investigators are no longer intact or have been largely or completely destroyed. Midden Sites. In examining the distribution of known sites and in an inspection of the localities themselves, several significant features at once become apparent. First, with the ex- ception of one unusual locality, it is noteworthy that no village or midden site thus far reported is more than 12 miles from the coast and that the great majority are within a range of 1 to 5 miles inland. This would seem to indicate that the bulk of Indian population was clus- tered along the coastal strip and that the more rugged mountainous interior of the island was largely uninhabited, at least as regards perma- nent village sites. The chief area of inland occupation appears to have been south of Rio Bueno, Dry Harbor, and St. Ann's Bay. This region is one of the few in the interior of Ja- maica which would have been both easy of access and suitable for manioc agriculture. It is quite possible, of course, that the concentration of sites in this region, as plotted on a map, gives a false picture of prehistoric population distri- bution. Practically all the archaeological ac- tivity on the north coast, particularly by non- 46 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="3">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JAMAICA professionals, has been confined to this general area. Perhaps equally intensive investigation of other sections of the island would yield com- parable results. One possible explanation for this group of sites is that they represent a late period with- drawal of coastal populations similar to that which occurred elsewhere in the West Indies (Rouse 1952: 568-70). This movement may have been due to the pressure of increasing population or it may represent a retreat in the face of hostile attacks on coastal settlements by the expanding Taino groups and, just prior to European contact, the warlike Carib. It is of interest that village sites throughout Jamaica are, almost without exception, on or near the tops of low lying hills, bordering the coastal plain, which afford a clear view of both sea and shoreline and at the same time offer positions easily defensible from attack. The majority of midden sites are also located fairly close to a source of fresh water supply and near land suitable for agriculture. The Jamaican Indians undoubtedly belonged to the Sub-Taino branch of the Arawak stock and this pattern of occupation is apparently typical of Sub- Taino culture wherever found, as Rouse (1942: 145) has noted a similar location preference in the Bani sites of Cuba. Most of the middens are relatively shallow and give the impression of having been occupied only a short period of time. A few exceptional deposits run as deep as 2 or 3 m. in some spots. The vast majority of sites, however, are only a few centimeters to 1 m. in depth. Such shallow middens may often be spread over a considerable area. Most of the sites investigated by the author, though, covered less than 1 acre. Apparently, the pat- tern in Jamaica was one of brief occupation by a group over a fairly wide area or movement from midden to midden by smaller groups. There seems to be no sharp differentiation between coastal and inland sites except for the slightly greater proportion of sea shells over land forms in the former. As in Cuba (Rouse 1942: 135), sites closest to the sea are generally somewhat shallower than those in the interior. There is no apparent formal arrangement of dwellings or other structures in any of the midden sites, although careful excavation might reveal otherwise in some cases. Stratification is only rarely present and, thus far at least, there is no evidence of culture change or differentia- tion where it does occur. Most of the middens are composed of sherds, griddle fragments, coney bones, fish spines, turtle and bird bones, pieces of coral, bits of limestone and other minerals, occasional stone artifacts such as celts and beads, ash and charcoal, and large quan- tities of land and sea shells with giant conches usually predominating. Authentic burials al- most never appear in middens although a few human bone fragments sometimes come to light. Most of the "Arawak" burials reported from middens in earlier writings probably repre- sent slave interments. It is obvious from the remains of these refuse deposits that the chief staple of Indian diet in Jamaica was shellfish. Manioc agriculture was probably of almost equal importance as the numerous griddle fragments point to the manufacture of cassava bread. Considering the popularity of shellfish, the concentration of village sites near the coasts is hardly surprising. The preference for hill tops can be explained in several ways. Defense may have been the primary consideration but there is no evidence of earthworks or palisades. Undoubtedly, a certain amount of intertribal warfare was car- ried on by the Arawak in Jamaica and the encroaching Taino had to be fended off, but the picture of these people as it emerges from the historical accounts is not warlike. Some writers have maintained that it was fear of the Carib raids that forced this occupation of stra- tegic hill top sites but the Carib threat came at much too late a date to have had any great influence in determining such a widespread village location pattern. The simplest explana- tion is that the hill tops, exposed to sea breezes, were, then as now, the most healthful and pleasant places to live in tropical Jamaica. The gap in site distribution from Port An- tonio on the north coast to Morant Point at the eastern tip of the island is probably more apparent than real. Sven Loven (1935: 119) has advanced the theory that the lack of sites here is attributable to less abundant sea life along the northern and eastern shores due to prevailing winds and ocean currents. C. Ber- nard Lewis and other Jamaican naturalists, however, do not concur with this suggestion. While shellfish collecting and fishing may have been more difficult along these rocky shores, it seems more likely that the paucity of reported sites in this area is due to the heavy cover of dense vegetation which effectively obscures whatever remains may be present. There is HOWARD ] 47</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY certainly no indication in the accounts of Men- dez and Columbus (Cundall 1894) that this portion of Jamaica was uninhabited at the time of first European contact. There are no plazas, ball courts, megaliths, or any other ceremonial structures yet reported from Jamaica. This is to be expected as Sub- Taino sites elsewhere in the Indies tend to lack any such manifestations of ceremonial elabora- tion. Caves. The Tertiary limestone that covers so much of the surface of Jamaica has been eroded and decomposed to form innumerable caves, sinkholes, and underground passages. Most of the caves are relatively small and the floors are usually covered with an accumulation of bat guano, fallen rock, and other debris that makes investigation both difficult and unpleas- ant. The caves containing aboriginal remains, which have been discovered in Jamaica up to the present, seem to have been used in 3 dif- ferent ways: (1) dwelling sites, (2) ossuaries, and (3) ceremonial chambers. The latter use can be inferred only from the fact that 3 large wooden zemi images, now in the British Mu- seum, were originally found in a cave in the Carpenter Hills in the 18th century. At the time of Duerden's report (1897), there were no cave sites known which gave any indication of having been used for occupa- tion purposes. However, the discovery and ex- ploration of the caves in the Portland Ridge area by C. B. Lewis, the author, and others in recent years has yielded conclusive evidence that caves were occasionally utilized as dwelling places by the Arawak. The Portland Ridge finds, however, would appear to be the excep- tion rather than the rule in Jamaica. For some reason, caves were utilized by the aborigines almost exclusively for burial purposes. The majority of the caves on the island were too limited in size ever to have housed more than a few individuals at one time. Early writers on the subject of caves were fond of the theory that the human remains discovered therein rep- resented the last tragic relics of Arawak who had hidden either from the Carib or the Span- iards and, somehow, had been immured in their place of refuge. This romantic interpreta- tion is still held by some individuals on the island today. However, as Duerden (1897: 25) pointed out long ago, the best known cave of that period, the Halberstadt, could not possibly have held more than 12 living adults while the bones of at least 34 individuals were dis- covered. Moreover, the proper proportion of bones is barely present. Some long bones and skulls are often missing entirely. In general, unless the cave gives indication of being undisturbed, it is very difficult to deter- mine accurately the original disposition of the bones and whatever other remains may be present. Displacement, due to earthquakes, fallen rock, and vandalism, is all too evident in most of the known caves. Skulls, particularly, are in demand by present day "obeah" practi- tioners although, as a rule, most natives shun and fear burial caves. No consistent pattern of deposit is apparent for the skeletal material in caves. Most of the bones do not seem to have been covered originally by earth or stones. In one or 2 caves, skulls have been found placed in rough alignment, sometimes occupying nat- ural shelves or ledges, but the usual arrange- ment is one of indiscriminate scattering of the bones on cave floors. The evidence is fairly clear that all the cave burials encountered thus far are secondary in nature. The bones give no indication of attempted cremation. Skulls and, sometimes, long bones were often placed in large pottery vessels and most of the com- plete pots found in museum collections today were obtained from burial caves. At one time, an excellent collection of skeletal material from these caves was available for study in the Institute of Jamaica but recent word is that it was largely destroyed by the violent hurricane which damaged the buildings of the Institute severely a few years ago. Aside from pottery, only a few other objects of archaeological interest have been found in caves. These include a lignum vitae Arawak seat, some large bark slabs which may have been either shields or pieces of a canoe, wooden "canoe" fragments of doubtful authenticity, shell beads, and the usual assortment of conchs, fish spines, and coney bones. In general, the distribution of burial caves corresponds fairly closely to that of the midden sites around the island. Rock Carvings. Nine rock carving sites have been reported, at one time or another, from various parts of Jamaica but it is difficult to determine how many of them are still in existence today. Indications as to their location are somewhat vague in the earlier reports and, for some obscure reason, vandals have effaced or chipped off and carried away most of the [ XXII, 1, 1956 48</page><page sequence="5">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JAMAICA known carvings shortly after their discovery. The only reproductions of Jamaican rock carv- ings in the literature are a few line drawings and several inadequate photographs contained in the Duerden monograph (1897: 48-51). One carving of a human face, which appears to have been chipped out of its context, is in the Institute of Jamaica collection but its authen- ticity is doubtful. Judging from all the available evidence, the carvings are true petroglyphs rather than picto- graphs. That is they are made by the use of incised lines cut in the stone and are not simple paintings on the rock surface. While pigments may have been used in conjunction with in- cision, exposure and erosion have effectively destroyed all such evidence except in the case of one known example at the site of Mountain River. Human and animal representations are the chief motifs in Jamaican rock carvings with the former predominating. Undoubtedly, the carvings had some sort of religious significance but it is futile to speculate any further about their meaning. Most of the carvings are simple in the extreme. Facial and body features are delineated by means of lines and dots and fur- ther details are left to the imagination. The most extensive rock carving site was found by Duerden (1897: 50) at Mountain River in St. Catharine Parish. In addition to several human representations, between 100 and 200 figures depicting various forms of animal life were also discovered including lizards, birds, and tur- tles. An unspecified black pigment, which had apparently withstood weathering very satisfac- torily, had been used in connection with their execution. Petroglyphs often provide clues as to the presence of archaeological sites in their vicinity and future Jamaican archaeologists might find exploration of areas where such carvings occur rewarding. It is interesting, however, that excluding 3 carvings in the Canoe Valley Road region, most of the reported rock carving sites are considerably farther from the coast than are the midden and cave sites and seem to bear no relation to them in regard to distribu- tion. What significance this may have can only be determined by further investigation. POTTERY: MAJOR STYLE At the present stage of archaeological knowl- edge and research in Jamaica, it is obviously impossible to make a complete or exhaustive study of the aboriginal pottery. This becomes particularly evident if one attempts to evolve developmental sequences or cultural differenti- ation in time and space on the basis of pottery analysis. The great bulk of Jamaican pottery collections in museums was made without any of the problems of modern archaeological re- search in mind. Furthermore, such information as did exist in the form of labels and supple- mentary field notes has, in large part, been destroyed or lost through the years. Until careful, large scale stratigraphic excavations are made and the undoubted regional and tem- poral differences in pottery traditions can be established accurately, it seems best to treat most of Jamaican pottery in terms of one major stylistic unit. Actually, from the evidence ac- cumulated thus far, the pottery is remarkably homogenous, both in techniques of manufac- ture and range of decorative modes employed. Only 2 variant substyles, Little River and Montego Bay, can be isolated at present. These will be discussed below. In terms of the ceramic classification for the West Indies proposed by Rouse (1939: 39), the bulk of Jamaican pottery belongs to the Meillac group, although it is distinctive and unusual in several respects. Its closest affilia- tions are with the Sub-Taino wares of Cuba, particularly the Banl. In time, the author feels it will be possible to establish a completely formulated pottery style in Jamaica comparable to Meillac in Haiti and Bani in Cuba but such an attempt seems premature in the present state of knowledge. Shape. As a result of numerous finds in burial caves, an unusually large number of complete or nearly com- plete pottery vessels are available for study. There are 2 basic shape categories for Jamaican pottery: (1) round bowls, and (2) boat-shaped vessels. Minor variants occur in each of these divisions. The boat-shaped vessels (Fig. 2 d) are oval in outline, viewed from above, and terminate at either end with elevated handles that are cylindrical or flat with flaring tips. These are often further decorated. A variant of this type of boat-shaped vessel occurs when only one end is elevated and a calabash shape is produced. Some- times, terminal handles are absent and the "prow" of the vessel is merely brought to a slightly thickened tri- angular peak. The lower part of both round and boat- shaped bowls is almost invariably symmetrically rounded. The one flat-bottomed vessel known to the author is a case of somewhat doubtful restoration. One conoidal- bottomed cup is present in the Institute of Jamaica col- lection. HOWARD ] 49</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY a d b C e h J k L ' FIG. 1.

Jamaican wood and stone artifacts and complete pottery specimens. HOWARD ] 51</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY The majority of both round and boat-shaped pots are shouldered. In most examples, the shoulder is slightly convex. As a rule, the sharper the angle of shoulder inturn, the flatter the shoulder will be. Shoulder width is uniform on the round bowls and becomes either slightly wider or narrower at the ends of boat-shaped vessels. Virtually all of the round bowls are symmetrically shaped with incurved sides, resulting in an aperture smaller than the greatest diameter of the vessel (Fig. 2 e). Some round bowls are fairly deep and full bodied, others are broad and shallow. In a few rare cases, the vessel approximates the shape of a hemisphere. Only occasionally, is any portion of the rim raised above the rest of the vessel. Round bowls vary from 12 to 20 cm. in width and from 8 to 15 cm. in height. The largest boat-shaped vessel encountered by the author measured 40 cm. in length, 28 cm. in height, and 25 cm. in width. Several shapes, such as tripod based, annular based, and compartmented vessels noted by Rouse (1941: 57) for Meillac pottery in Haiti have not as yet been dis- covered in Jamaica. The only specimen of a miniature or paint pot is that reported by DeWolf (1953: 232) as having been found at Little River. Apertures. In all the complete specimens apertures are large, in most cases being at least /3 of the maxi- mum width of the vessel and, in the case of a few boat- shaped vessels, almost the same size. Several rim sherds appear to have come from jars or constricted bottle necks but it is difficult to determine the original size or shape of these containers. Manufacture. The methods of pottery manufacture suggested by Rouse (1941: 55-8) for Meillac pottery were apparently those employed in Jamaica. Like its Haitian counterpart, Jamaican pottery is of coiled construction, the coils being set and shaped by anvil and paddle tech- nique rather than scraping. The clay of the fired vessels varies in color from brick red through reddish gray, reddish brown, dull black, buff, and pale yellow. The finished pots were fired by the open hearth method and several sherds show what appears to be a layer of black carbon between the outer and inner surfaces which is probably the result of imperfect firing. Most of the body sherds found in middens are blackened through exposure to fire either from cooking soot or due to the firing process itself. Vessel walls in Jamaican wares tend to be relatively thin and uniform in thickness throughout. The thinnest specimen measured in the collections was 4 mm., the thickest 1 cm. The average thickness seems to be about 8 mm. A dull polish was universally applied to the outer surfaces and often to the interior of the pot as well. Decorated surfaces, lugs, and handles are hardly ever polished, however. None of the specimens examined gave evidence of bearing a true slip. There is little indication of added coloring matter or artificial temper in Jamaican pottery. Apparently, the available clays contained the necessary ingredients for successful pottery manufacture in their natural state. Rims. Rim profiles, viewed in cross section, are of 3 types: (1) rounded, (2) tapering, and (3) rectangular. Rounded rims are the most common variety. Tapered rims usually show tapering on the inside only. Ridges or fillets were frequently applied along the outer surface of the rim. Thickening of the rim coil often produces much the same effect. In at least one example, a ridge has been placed on the inside of the rim but this is uncommon. Decoration. While it is difficult to estimate percent- ages, it can safely be said that the majority of Jamaican vessels are undecorated or only very sparingly decorated. Other writers, such as Rouse (1939: 117) and Rainey (1940: 148), who have made comparative studies of West Indian pottery agree that there is less decoration, and that fewer decorative modes appear on Jamaican ceramics than on comparable wares elsewhere in the Caribbean. On the other hand, several decorative tech- niques noted below seem to be confined almost exclu- sively to Jamaica. With the exception of the aberrant Montego Bay sub- type, the use of incision in Jamaican pottery is relatively rare. Incised designs were usually executed with a thin, sharp implement, perhaps a bird or fish bone, and no attempt was made to smooth or polish the area after- wards. Shoulders, handles, and lugs are the favorite areas for incised decoration. Rims and ridges only occa- sionally receive such treatment. The designs are in- variably geometric and are simple and limited in number for the most part. The most common design is composed of groups of alternating oblique parallel lines producing a W-shaped effect (Fig. 2e). When applied to the shoulder this design runs uniformly around the vessel. There are several variations to this basic pattern. Ob- lique parallel lines, sometimes slightly curved, and verti- cal parallel lines are also used. The latter, however, are usually confined to lugs and handles. A pair of hori- zontal parallel lines are often incised around the vessel just below the rim or on the ridge. Sometimes a third line is added but rarely, if ever, more. Crosshatching, so common in Meillac wares elsewhere, is surprisingly rare in Jamaica. The same is true of the X design. One handle from the Longley collection in the American Museum bears a deeply incised V but this is the only example known to the author. The favorite decoration for rim tops is that of closely spaced parallel incisions, usually about 5 mm. apart, which are sometimes cut deeply enough to give the edge a serrated effect. Curved lines occur on only a very few sherds. Spirals, concentric circles, and parallel curved lines comprise the uses to which curved incision is most frequently put. Punctation is only infrequently employed as a decora- tive mode in Jamaican Meillac. It usually accompanies line incision. Most commonly, evenly spaced parallel rows of dots are placed on the shoulder or on the rim and above any incised design that may be present (Fig. 1 i). Most dots are small but one or two measure as 52 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="9">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JAMAICA much as 1 cm. in diameter. Their shape depends on the implement that was originally used to make them, bird and coney bones or slivers of hard wood probably being the tools most often employed. The technique of application, of the sort so frequently encountered in Meillac decoration in the early period in Haiti, in which strips of clay are applied to the surface of the vessel to form geometric and naturalistic designs, is only rarely encountered in Jamaica. Several different applied designs have been noted thus far. These include a sigmoid or S-shaped motif (Fig. 1 g), a dot and circle design with a dot of clay placed inside a circle (Fig. 1 k), an applied spiral, and a limb design in which an applied strip has been flattened and broadened at one end and marked with two vertically incised lines so as to vaguely resemble the limb of an animal or reptile (Fig. 11). These designs were most often applied to the vessel shoulder. One unusual handle (Fig. 1 j) has human facial features depicted by means of application but it is unique in Jamaican collections. Lugs and handles show the greatest variation and are the most consistently decorated features of Jamaican pot- tery. There are 4 main types of handles: (1) the cylindrical knoblike handle, (2) the loop handle, (3) the flaring tipped handle, and (4) the raised laterally per- forated knob handle. The loop handle (Fig. 1 b) is the least frequently encountered of these. It was made by affixing a thin, rectangular, ribbon-like strip of clay in the shape of a loop with one end attached to the vessel shoulder and the other to the rim. Such handles never seem to show further decoration. The flaring tipped handle (Fig. 1 a) is the type most often met with. These handles are usually placed at either end of boat-shaped vessels in such a way as to be continuations of the vessel wall. Sometimes, this handle remains relatively thick and flat; at other times the entire handle is thickened and be- comes somewhat oval in cross section as a result of the pinching in process. The tip surface is usually serrated more or less heavily in such cases. Cylindrical knobs (Fig. 1 c) are frequently placed at either end of vessels at the apex or just below the rim. There may be only one knob or groups of two or three. The tops of these knobs are ordinarily slightly depressed. The fourth main type of handle (Fig. 1 d) seems to be a development unique to Jamaica. Rouse (personal communication) reports occasional finds of such handles elsewhere in the West Indies but believes they are trade sherds from Jamaica. This rather massive handle is composed of a raised knob that has been perforated laterally. A small serrated ridge is usually applied to the vessel wall under the handle so that the total effect is one of a crude face with the perforations representing the eyes, and the ridge, the mouth. It would be interest- ing to know to what type of vessel these handles were affixed. Judging from their size, they were probably used on large bowls or water jars. There are a few other aberrant handle types but these occur so infrequently as to suggest they may be trade sherds. Decorative modes on handles comprise most of those already discussed. Lugs are of 2 chief types, the most important being the wedge-shaped variety which is usually applied to the vessel at the inturn parallel to the rim (Fig. 1 e). These lugs may be placed in opposing pairs at either end of the pot or, in the case of circular bowls, another set of pairs may be added on opposite sides of the vessel. These wedge-shaped lugs are almost invariably vertically incised and, sometimes, horizontally as well. Such lugs are frequently placed on the shoulder or rim at the ends of the vessel and may be combined to form dif- ferent decorative patterns. The other type of lug is a cylindrical knob, similar to the cylindrical-knobbed handle, except that it is smaller and has been moved down to the vessel inturn. This type of lug is often placed in pairs at opposite ends of the pot. Perforation of the shoulder at the base of the handles is sometimes practiced on Jamaican pottery but it does not occur frequently. Usually the perforations are paired, with one hole on either side of the handle base to allow the vessel to be suspended. Painting. Aside from the distinctive Little River pot- tery discovered by DeWolf (1953), painting is con- spicuous by its absence or near absence as a decorative mode in Jamaican ceramics. Five sherds from Jamaican collections bearing traces of paint are known to the author, Little River material excluded. These sherds come from widely scattered localities on the island. All are small and bear only a few flecks of dull red paint. In view of the extreme rarity of painted wares, and the distribution of the sherds that have been found, it is most likely that the examples mentioned are all trade sherds. Modeling. Modeling was relatively poorly developed in Jamaican pottery. A few handles and lugs show modeled heads that may be either human or animal representations. Several can be identified, with fair cer- tainty, as turtle or snake heads. These specimens are sometimes hollow, sometimes solid. The mouth and eyes are indicated by crude incision. Molding occurs on several sherds in Jamaican collec- tions that resemble closely the Red Ware reported by Krieger (1931: 76-7) from San Juan in the Dominican Republic and a similar pottery type discovered by Fewkes (1907: 180-1) near Manati, Puerto Rico. As the Red Ware occurs at fairly early levels in these sites, its appearance in Jamaica may eventually offer some clues in dating sites where it is found. The author col- lected examples of the ware in such widely separated sites in Jamaica as Montego Bay and Portland Ridge but only in very small numbers. These sherds consist of raised pottery surfaces representing the features of the human face and constitute an extension of the vessel body itself rather than being affixed or luted. The distinctive color of the ware was achieved by the applica- tion of a red slip. The sherds are usually highly polished. HOWARD ] 53</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Probably these are trade wares but another interesting possibility is that they may be part of the Little River substyle. Only more intensive investigation of Jamaican ceramics will provide the final answer. A unique pot from the Henry Vendryes collection (Fig. 2 d), which was recovered from the White Marl site near Kingston, combines so many features rarely or never occurring in Jamaican wares that it is almost cer- tainly a trade piece, possibly from Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic. These modes include globular shape, face modeling on the vessel front, "coffee bean" eyes, ring base, U-shaped handle, and the use of "tear lines" beneath the eyes. Other Pottery Manufactures. Pottery pestles are occa- sionally encountered in Jamaican collections. They are roughly conical in shape, elongated, and cylindrical in cross section. Several of the specimens are laterally per- forated at the top and at least one shows a concave depression on the bottom. This may indicate that these implements were amulets or ornaments of some sort rather than pestles. Griddle fragments are among the most frequent finds in Jamaican midden sites. No complete examples have ever been found but, judging from the pieces, the original specimens averaged between 30 and 35 cm. in diameter. They were approximately circular in shape, slightly polished on the upper surface, and often beveled around the edge. The average thickness of these griddles is between 2 and 3 cm. Most of them were poorly fired as the clay in the center of the griddle often disintegrates when exposed to water. POTTERY: VARIANT SUBSTYLES Little River. The Little River substyle was discovered by DeWolf on the north central coast of Jamaica in 1933 and was discussed in print (DeWolf 1953) some 20 years later. In terms of the time scale set up by Rouse (1939, 1941, 1948, 1951, 1952) for the West Indies, Little River is probably the earliest ceramic tradition to appear in Jamaica. There is no evidence, as yet, of any preceramic culture corresponding to Period I Ciboney or similar cultures elsewhere in the Indies. Nor does the Cuevas horizon style typical of Period II seem to have reached Jamaica. The Little River style, as DeWolf points out, probably belongs to Period IIIa and represents an extension of the Cuevas-Ostiones tradition of Puerto Rico into Jamaica. DeWolf feels it to be closer to early Ostiones than to either Cuevas or late Ostiones style. Certainly the high incidence of D-shaped handles, loop handles, flat bottoms, use of paint, and the rarity of incised and affixed decoration in Little River wares mark them off distinctly from the main body of Jamaican pottery. Montego Bay. While less striking in its deviation from the main Jamaican pottery tradition, the distinctive ware found by the author at the Fairfield site, near Montego Bay, is so unusual in several respects, particu- larly in its use of incision, that is seems probable it repre- sents a definite substyle. The sherds from the Windsor site reported by DeWolf (1953: 236) undoubtedly should be classified with this group. The favorite design em- ployed in the Montego Bay ware consists of groups of short, horizontal, parallel lines heavily incised around the vessel just below the rim about one centimeter apart (Fig. 1 h). The groups usually contain either 3 or 4 lines. Sometimes, a single broken line is incised around the rim edge. In all cases, the incision tends to be exceptionally broad and deep. Short, wide, oblique parallel lines form another common design, usually placed on rim edges. The massiveness of Montego Bay ware allows sufficient space on the rim surfaces to permit decoration. The most popular design for this purpose consists of 2 rows of alternating short lines that are little more than elongated dots. Virtually all the incision on Montego Bay ware is much deeper, heavier, and less carefully applied than that usually found on Jamai- can pottery. Little or no smoothing apparently was done after the incision had been made. This type of incision seems in keeping with the coarse heavy nature of the ware itself. Precisely what relation Montego Bay bears to the main tradition of Jamaican Meillac or what its position in the time sequence may be cannot be fully determined with- out careful stratigraphic excavation. The author is in- clined to place it at a somewhat late period, perhaps early in Period IV, though it certainly bears no relation to Carrier or other typical Period IV wares elsewhere in the Indies. POTTERY: SUMMARY Viewing Jamaican pottery as a whole, the 2 substyles excepted, one receives the impression of a relatively undifferentiated and conservative tradition, conforming in general to the Meillac pattern as it developed in the West Indian cul- ture center to the north and east. An analysis of the characteristics of classic Meillac as form- ulated by Rouse (1940: 57-8) indicates im- mediately the predominance in Jamaican pot- tery of modes typical of the later forms in the main Meillac tradition. For example, cylindrical lugs, zoomorphic face design, horizontal parallel line design, limb design, and sigmoid design are all listed by Rouse as absent in early Meillac wares but all are present in Jamaica. On the other hand, the grid design, the execu- tion of typically incised designs in application, designs partly incised, partly applied, the dot design applied, and the strip on the rim edge replacing the ridge, all of which are absent in late Meillac, are conspicuous by their rarity or absence in Jamaica. Painting, of course, occurs only in the earliest levels in Haiti. Such painting as occurs in Jamaica seems more close- ly allied to Puerto Rican traditions and prob- ably derives from this source, directly or indirectly. 54 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="11">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JAMAICA As noted previously, Jamaican wares show a closer resemblance to the Bani type of pottery as reported from Cuba by Harrington (1921) and Rouse (1941) than to the Meillac tradition of Hispaniola. In both Jamaican and Bani pottery, affixation is the technique most com- monly used to produce lugs and handles of various designs. The same incised designs are preferred. Loop handles are rare and crudely made and modeling was only poorly developed in the 2 traditions. Despite these obvious Meillac and Bani af- filiations, Jamaican pottery gives evidence of an independent, if rather retarded, development along certain lines. Possibly the peripheral po- sition of the island accounts for this to some extent. Compared with the wares of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, Jamaican ceramics appear somewhat crude, unimaginative, and provin- cial. Decorative modes such as painting, model- ing, and application occur infrequently and are only rudimentarily developed. Some features of Meillac and Bani, such as ovoid design, line and dot incision, and everted rims, which probably reflect Carrier influence, never dif- fused to Jamaica. On the other hand, a few features of Ja- maican pottery seem to be confined almost exclusively to the island. most notably the massive, laterally perforated knob handle. The flaring tipped handle is also unusual for the frequency with which it is employed and for the distinctive shape it assumes in Jamaican wares. As the archaeology of Jamaica becomes better known, it will doubtless be possible to distinguish both areal and temporal differences in the pottery of the island to a far greater degree but such analysis must await detailed stratigraphic excavation of a large number of sites. STONE WORK Celts. The stone artifacts most frequently encountered in Jamaican archaeological sites are the ubiquitous stone celts. At one time, they were extremely common finds in the countryside but they are much rarer today. The natives usually refer to them as "thunder stones" and believe they are helpful in cooling water if placed in the bottom of a jar. Jamaican celts are basically so much like those found in other West Indian islands that they need not be described in any great detail. Most of them are petaloid or almond shaped, bilaterally symmetrical, and have been carefully shaped and polished. They vary in size from 5 to 20 cm. in length and average about 4 cm. in width and 2 cm. in thickness. One unusual specimen in the Lady Blake collection is exceptionally large and has a central boss while another is roughly T-shaped. These celts are made from a wide variety of igneous and metamorphic rocks, with basalt, dolorite, and a type of greenish schist being the materials most frequently utilized. The large celts were undoubtedly hafted and the pointed bit was used for chopping and cutting. Rouse (1941: 95) suggests the tiny specimens had orna- mental or ceremonial use. Axes. Only one grooved ax has been reported from Jamaica and it is doubtful whether it is truly Jamaican in origin. The ax is made of diorite and shows some evidence of having been hafted. The entire surface has been smoothed by grinding. The blade is roughly oval in shape with the cutting edge left relatively blunt. Rainey (1940: 148) remarks that this specimen is similar to the eared axes of the Lesser Antilles. Pestles. Pestles are another class of stone artifact occasionally recovered from Jamaican sites. Five speci- mens are to be found in the Institute of Jamaica collec- tions and 3 others are present in the Longley collection in the American Museum. All are conical in shape and, with one exception, flat bottomed. The bottom of the variant is slightly convex. Four of the pestles terminate in zoomorphic heads, crudely delineated. One is a fairly well carved representation of a bird. One of the Longley specimens looks as though it may have been a phallic symbol. Two crudely carved heads in the Institute of Jamaica collection are apparently pestle fragments. Like the heads on the complete specimens (Fig. 2c), they are flat-topped with facial features roughly outlined by use of broad incised lines and circular depressions. Pestles are made of sandstone, marble, and basalt. The largest measures approximately 15 cm. in height, the others vary between 10 and 13 cm. It is highly probable, of course, that several if not all of these "pestles" are zemi images or had some other religious significance. Ornaments. Ornaments of any kind are very rare in either middens or museum collections in Jamaica. Two marble amulets, representing anthropomorphic figures in a flexed position, were found at Long Mountain near Kingston. Both are perforated laterally so that they could be suspended about the neck or, possibly, worn on the forehead when the wearer went into battle. The Arawak of Haiti wore such figurines or amulets in his- toric times in this way (Loven 1935: 580). These amulets are 7 cm. in length and 3 cm. wide. Tubular, longi- tudinally drilled beads of chalcedony, somewhat irregular in size, are to be seen in the Institute of Jamaica collec- tions. These beads average about 2 cm. in diameter and between 1 and 3 cm. in length. A few similar beads were reported found in the Halberstadt burial cave (Duerden 1897: 36). Rainey (1940: 148) indicates that such beads are much smaller than tubular beads usually found in Puerto Rico. Duerden (1897: 36) describes and illustrates a small quartz ornament from the Cranbrook site which has been carved to resemble 2 articulating vertebrae. HOWARD ] 55</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Utilitarian Stone Artifacts. Grinding stones and ham- merstones have been found at several sites on the island. Most of them are quartzite stream boulders which have been used with relatively little reshaping except for arti- ficial flattening of one surface. A maul or roller of fossil coral, about 30 cm. long and roughly cylindrical in shape, is on display in the Institute of Jamaica. The only positively authentic flint artifacts thus far found in Jamaica are rough, slightly retouched chips, flakes and cores which were doubtless used as knives and scrapers. The 75 flint arrowheads reported by Loven (1932) to have been found near Old Harbour are almost certainly not of Jamaican origin. Such arrowheads would be unique not only in Jamaica but the rest of the Greater Antilles as well. Also of doubtful Jamaican origin are the large 3-legged metates, with accompanying manos which are at present in the Institute of Jamaica collection. They are unmis- takeably Central American in design and execution and totally unrelated to the rest of Arawak manufacturers in Jamaica. Probably, they were brought over by groups of Indians from Central America who were sent to Jamaica as auxiliary labor supply by the Spaniards when the native Arawak population was on the point of ex- tinction. The so-called "slave mortars," large flat boulders in which a convex-shaped depression has been made, may possibly be Arawak in origin but none has ever been found in situ in authentic Indian sites. Several problematical stone objects are to be found in collections of Jamaican materials. These are variously described as pendants, weights, or sinkers. They are carefully shaped, highly polished, spindle-shaped imple- ments which are either laterally perforated at one end or longitudinally pierced. The frequency with which similar artifacts are found in Puerto Rico and other Antillean islands suggests some sort of purely utilitarian function for them. A stone ball from the Cundall collection (Cundall 1894: 72) and whetstones of chalk and limestone com- plete the meager inventory of Jamaican stone manu- factures. WOOD WORK There is good evidence from the historical accounts that the Jamaican Arawak were skilled woodworkers. Columbus, at the time of his discovery of the island, was met by natives sailing large elaborately carved canoes. The fact that stone, shell, and bone work were relatively poorly developed in Jamaica suggests that, in many cases, wood may have taken the place of these materials in the technology. Because of the humid climate, however, very little of the aboriginal woodwork has survived in Jamaica with the exception of objects which were placed in dry burial caves. The most elaborate examples of woodwork yet found on the island are several large statues which were originally discovered in 1792 in a cave in the Carpenter Hills and later sent to the British Museum. All were carved of mahogany. Of the 4 figures, 2 seem to be zoomorphic representations. The first of these has the head of a long-billed bird with the body carved roughly in the shape of a cross. Bracelets or ligatures are repre- sented around the knees and upper arms. Anatomical details such as thumb and fingers and male genitals are crudely delineated. The other statue shows a bird, also long billed, standing on the back of a turtle, the bird's body being decorated with broad incised geometric de- signs. The third statue in the series (Fig. 2a) represents a naked male figure, with large square head, standing with legs apart and hands resting on the upper thighs. Eyes and teeth are inlaid with mother of pearl and "tear lines" are carved on the face. Ligatures are shown on the limbs of this statue also. The fourth statue is smaller than the others and represents a crouching human being from whose back and shoulders an um- brella like canopy protrudes. "Tear lines" are also pres- ent here. There can be little doubt that these figures are examples of the idols or zemis which played such an important role in Arawak religion and which are so frequently referred to in early literature on the Arawak. An interesting and important specimen of Jamaican woodwork is the stool or seat found by C. B. Lewis at the Cambridge Hill cave site (Fig. 2b). It is the only completely authentic example thus far found on the island of the typical Arawak seat, so commonly associ- ated with Taino culture elsewhere in the Caribbean, and follows the general design of such seats fairly closely. It is made of lignum vitae and is remarkably well preserved. The seat is small, with the bottom rest- ing on the ground, while the front terminates in a carved zoomorphic head. The back of the seat is 9 inches from the ground while the width varies between 3 and 4 inches. A similar wooden stool, lacking the zoomorphic head, in the collection of the Yale Peabody Museum may be of Jamaican origin but this is not certain. OTHER MATERIALS Shell. While marine and land shells constitute the great bulk of most of the midden deposits found in Jamaica, shell does not seem to have been widely utilized by the Arawak in the making of tools or ornaments. This is in marked contrast to the Sub-Taino culture of Cuba where shell work was relatively highly developed. Rouse (1948: 516) is probably correct in suggesting that the difference is due to the influence of the Ciboney in Cuba, as the Cibony used shell extensively in their technology. The marine species of shells found in Jamaican mid- dens are all common in waters around the islands today and include some varieties that are regarded as inedible by present day natives. Practically all the Gastropod species found in sites show a large, irregular, artificial perforation, varying from 1/2 to 1 inch in size, behind the mouth of the shell. These holes are hardly ever smoothed or retouched in any way. The hole may have been made to facilitate extraction but a more likely explanation is that the holes were employed to string shells together on collecting expeditions. If shells ever were strung into 56 [ XXII, 1, 1956</page><page sequence="13">THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JAMAICA necklaces there is no positive indication, except in the case of 32 small shell beads made of Oliva reticularis which were recovered from a cave at Richmond Hill. Only the body whorl was retained in these beads which are now on exhibition at the Institute of Jamaica. Shell celts, made from Strombus gigas, have been discovered in a few sites. They are generally petaloid, or, more often, oval in shape and approximately the same size as the average stone specimens. None of the shell examples displays the same careful workmanship and finish characteristic of the stone celts. Conch tips, which have sometimes been ground to a fine point, and which were perhaps used as picks or awls; outer portions of the conch broken into the rough shape of a dipper or cup; and curved knife-shaped implements are the only other examples of Jamaican shell work known to the author. Bone. Considering the poor conditions for preserva- tion, a surprisingly large amount of bone material has been preserved from Jamaican midden sites. The ma- jority of bones found are those of the so-called "Indian" coney, Geocapromys brownei, the only mammal large enough to be worth hunting on the island in aboriginal times. While coney bones in their natural state may have been used as tools by the Arawak, no unmistakeable artifacts of coney bone have ever been found in Jamai- can middens. The bones of turtles, crocodiles, snakes, birds, and manatees have also been found in a number of sites but, with the exception of a crocodile tooth pendant reported by DeWolf (1953: 236), none of this bone material seems to have been utilized in the tech- nology in any way. Fish bones too, while frequently en- countered in middens, give little or no evidence of arti- ficial sharpening or other alteration. Coral. Pieces of Madrepore coral are frequently met with in midden deposits in Jamaica. Usually, these con- sist of fragments of coral stems or branches but, occa- sionally, large, relatively flat slabs are also encountered. The occurrence of such large amounts of coral in mid- den refuse is somewhat difficult to explain. Some of the pieces may have been used as files, rasps, or graters, but none of the specimens examined by the author gave any positive evidence of having been so employed. Where fossil coral was used, it seems to have been treated merely as another type of stone. Conclusions. Prehistoric Jamaica does not appear to have been occupied before the be- ginning of Period III in the Rouse (1939: 57-72) time scale. No prepottery sites corresponding to Period I in the rest of the Indies have been discovered as yet in Jamaica nor any of the distinctive flint, stone, and shell implements characteristic of the Ciboney. Of the 3 main Arawak groups, the Igneri, the Taino, and the Sub-Taino, only the last appear to have reached Jamaica. Thus, Period II, which marks the entrance of the Igneri from South America and their expansion into the Antilles, is also unrepre- sented in Jamaica. Most of the Jamaican archaeological remains appear to belong to the latter part of Period III. DeWolf's (1953) Little River materials are the only evidence we have for possible occupation earlier in this Period. Period IV, which is characterized by the Carib invasion and the expansion of the Taino at the expense of the Sub-Taino, seems to have been only a distant echo in Jamaica. While the Jamaican Arawak knew and feared the raiding Carib, as all the historical accounts make abundantly clear, the Carib left no lasting traces on the island. Neither is the cultural elaboration of the Taino, which was taking place during this time in Haiti and Puerto Rico, evident in Jamaica. It would appear that, once having reached the island, the Jamaican Sub-Taino continued the culture they brought with them with relatively little change or advancement until the arrival of the Spaniards. Certainly the 2 salient characteristics of Ja- maican culture which emerge from this archae- ological survey are, first, the relative poverty of the culture, particularly in comparison with later Taino cultures of the Greater Antilles and even in relation to the Cuban Sub-Taino groups, and, secondly, the apparent stagnation, or, at least, very slow rate of cultural change which took place on the island over a period of several hundred years. In this respect, Ja- maica would seem to be a prime example of what Kroeber (1948: 418) has termed "periph- eral retardation." The salient features of Arawak culture in general and the Sub-Taino culture in particular have been too well summarized by Rouse (1948: 495-567) to be further analyzed here. As Rouse (1948: 542) has pointed out, the great bulk of material written by the early explorers on the Arawak deals with the natives of Hispaniola and no attempt was made by these authors to distinguish between the cultures of the Taino and Sub-Taino groups. This paucity of authentic ethnographic or historical data is particularly evident in regard to the Jamaican Arawak. It will be, therefore, largely the re- sponsibility of the archaeologist to fill in the present great gaps in our knowledge. Certainly the most puzzling problem that future investigators must try to solve is the reason for Jamaica's cultural retardation. This HOWARD ] 57</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY cannot be explained solely by the peripheral position of the island in the greater Antilles. It is true that Jamaica was somewhat out of the way of the main stream of population movements and cultural diffusion in the West Indies but the preconquest peoples of the island were in no sense severely isolated from their neighbors. There is ample historical and archae- ological evidence that considerable contact took place between all the islands before the coming of the Spaniards and Jamaica was well situated to receive any cultural stimuli from either Cen- tral or South America. An explanation solely in terms of ecology is obviously inadequate. Jamaica offered a variety of natural resources, soils, and potential food supplies equal or superior to any island in the West Indies. Nor are the natural barriers sufficiently formidable in view of the known seafaring ability of all the Arawak groups. The fact remains that, viewed at present, Jamaican culture appears to have been a somewhat unique and indige- nous configuration which was unusually uni- form in content and which changed very little and very slowly during its span of existence. While any number of possible explanations could be advanced as to why the developed ceremonialism, advanced technology, and more complex social and political organization typi- cal of the Antillean culture center failed to diffuse to Jamaica, the ultimate answers are probably to be found in internal features of the aboriginal culture itself. How many of these patient archaeological research can reveal remains to be seen. The crying need at present in Jamaican archaeology is for detailed stratigraphic ex- cavation in as many undisturbed sites in as many different parts of the island as possible. Only when this has been accomplished can we assess Jamaican culture in its proper per- spective. BLAKE, LADY EDITH 1895 The Norbrook Kitchen Midden.

June, 1955 DEVELOPMENT OF PERUVIAN COASTAL TIAHUANACOID STYLES* Louis M. STUMER IN many works on Peruvian archaeology with their necessary emphasis on pottery styles as diagnostic elements of cultural development and change, one is often struck by the seeming confusion and number of styles in the Tia- huanacoid or Middle periods, and the result- ing number of conflicting names for chrono- logically affiliated strains. This paper is an attempt to clarify in part this confusion and also an attempt to explain why it should exist and undoubtedly will continue to exist for some time to come, or at least until a great deal more field research has been completed on the coast of Peru. In spite of recent advances in architectural and textile analysis, ceramic styles still remain the soundest diagnostic elements for tracing pre-Columbian Peruvian culture sequences. In a cultural development such as that of ancient Peru, with its highly diversified regional civili- zations, whose cultural manifestations from * The author is deeply indebted to William Duncan Strong for suggesting this article and his kindness and cooperation in making available the material from the Columbia University share of the Viri Valley Project and also the photographs and collections of the 1952-53 Columbia University Nazca-Ica Expedition. time to time are influenced by "horizon styles," it is more than advisable to be able to trace culture sequences and their relationship to one another. Future absolute dating and detailed analysis in this way can be put into a proper frame of reference and cross reference. Al- though strong inferences may be drawn from certain areas where detailed study has taken place, such as the Chicama valley (Larco 1948), Virui valley (Ford and Willey 1949; Strong and Evans 1952), Ancon area (Strong, Willey, and Corbett 1943; Willey and Corbett 1954), and the Nazca (Rio Grande) valley (Strong 1954), so many important regions of the Peruvian Coast have not yet received the field research they merit that it is still difficult to present culture sequences for the coastal regions in general with any real degree of as- surance. However, recent excavations and sur- veys have indicated that there are many as yet unknown regional styles and greater intervalley stylistic differences than had been previously contemplated, especially during epochs when the coastal regions were not united either re- ligiously, politically, or stylistically, thus tend- ing to make general inferences rather risky when drawn from a study of a single valley.
