Viano, PhD, Assistant Department Head, General Motors Research Laboratories, Biom?dical Sciences Department, Warren, Ml 48090-9055 1 HE DESIGN OF AUTOMOTIVE occupant protection systems is a process based on an understanding of the mechanisms of injury and human impact tolerance. Injury mechanisms are the physical processes that result in tissue damage and functional impairment. Human impact toler? ance refers to the levels of stress or load that the human system can withstand with little or no injury. This field of research is called injury biomechanics (7). It focuses on the nonpenetrating types of injuries that can occur among restrained and unrestrained occupants of highway vehicles involved in crashes. Given sufficient information about injury mech? anisms and tolerances, engineers can develop sys? tems that will provide maximum occupant protection across the full range of crash configura? tions. Effective systems are achieved through de? veloping realistic anthropomorphic test devices, or dummies, that respond with biomechanical fidelity to impact. Their characteristics provide criteria for evaluating engineering measurements in relation to human injury risk. In turn, the dummy and criteria are used to assess the effectiveness of protective systems in the development stage as well as in actual crashes. Crash Injuries There are two basic mechanisms involved in blunt, nonpenetrating impact injury to persons: localized loading of the human body and accelera? tion in the direction of loading. In the automotive environment, the primary collision of the vehicle with whatever it strikes is followed by an impact of the occupant with the inside of the vehicle. Local loading of a part of the human body against the instrument panel, or a seat belt, is referred to as the "second collision.'' There is a "third collision' * between soft tissue and skeletal struc? tures that takes place inside the body as it is stopped by the vehicle's interior or restraint sys? tem. The contribution of the two types of impacts to the injury process differs, depending on the body region and the severity of impact. The basic function of an occupant protection system is to reduce the severity of these impacts and thus their potential for causing injury. Several examples of occupant protection systems currently in passenger cars will demonstrate the role of biomechanics in vehicle design for injury control. Early Years in Automotive Safety The earliest automotive safety technology em? phasized structural integrity of the passenger com- November-December 1987, Vol. 102, No. 6 595</page><page sequence="2">. . . Data derived from head, chest, and knee contacts . . . provided the first information on human tolerance to impact forces/ partment to provide containment of the occupant in frontal and roll-over crashes. In the 1960s, the concept of energy management through crushable front-end structures was added. This combined approach attempted to preserve the occupants' space, while the vehicle's crushing structures ab? sorbed crash energy, lengthened the stopping time and distance of the passenger compartment, and thus reduced impact decelerations acting on the occupant. Further improvements were achieved by isolating the front-end structures from the passen? ger compartment to minimize intrusion or defor? mation around the occupant. This method of controlling the vehicle's impact is an important part of the total occupant protection system in current automobiles. For an unrestrained occupant, the controlled deceleration of the vehicle in a frontal crash is followed by the impact of the occupant against the vehicle interior. During this "second impact," the unbelted occupant continues to travel forward at the vehicle's precrash velocity and strikes the interior, which has come to rest in front of the occupant. The protection of the occupant in this situation depends upon energy-absorbing interior structures and load-distributing surfaces that re? duce the occupant's deceleration while spreading the impact forces over a broad portion of the body's strongest parts. Interior Safety Engineering The concept of impact energy absorption has two aspects. First, the deceleration of the occupant should be extended as long as possible. This can be done by having the occupant interact with something that deforms in a controlled manner, thus increasing the body's stopping distance. Sec? ond, it is important that the yielding structure does not spring back at the occupant, but deforms permanently or recovers very slowly. Otherwise, the impact energy is returned to the occupant and not absorbed by the deformed structure. Although one method to achieve energy absorp? tion and load distribution is with thick, slow- recovery foam padding, there are practical limitations on its effectiveness in severe crashes. As a result, more complex systems have been devel? oped to improve occupant protection. This has been achieved for the driver by the development of an energy-absorbing (EA) steering system, which uses a force-limiting column to safely decelerate the driver's chest, and a high-penetration-resistant (HPR) windshield, which uses a stretchable plastic layer between two sheets of glass for head impact protection. Energy-Absorbing Steering System In the early 1960s, automotive safety engineers were seeking information on the force tolerance of the chest. This information was needed for the development of an EA steering system to safely decelerate an unrestrained body contacting the steering wheel. The basic concept was to design a steering column to crush at a prescribed load, one not great enough to cause significant rib fracture. This device would increase the driver's stopping distance, decrease thoracic deceleration, and ab? sorb impact energy. However, the design effort stalled because the available human tolerance data did not provide specific information on the appropriate yield force for the system. In addition, the calculated tolerable force using the accepted 60-g whole-body decelera? tion tolerance, and an approximately 30-kg chest mass, indicated a 17.6 kilo-Newton (3,960-lb.) tolerance that seemed unrealistically high for sys? tem design. The basic safety objective was to design the yield force as high as practicable, consistent with human tolerance; to maximize the energy-absorbing capacity; and to extend the range of safety function of the system. Faced with uncertain information on the force tolerance of the chest, researchers developed a crash simulation facility and conducted experi? ments on human tolerance in automotive crash situations. The first experiments (2) involved sled tests with embalmed cadavers in order to simulate the response of an unrestrained occupant interact? ing with loadmeasuring surfaces. Data derived from head, chest, and knee contacts against pad? ded load-cells provided the first information on human tolerance to impact forces. The resulting data on force tolerance of the rib cage provided the necessary biomechanical information to permit design of the energy-absorbing element in the steering system. Subsequent experiments (5) with a prototype EA steering system confirmed that a 3.29-kN (740-lb.) maximum hub force on the sternum and an 8.00-kN (1,800-lb.) maximum load 596 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="3">on the shoulders and chest allowed column com? pression with only minor risk of rib fracture for a well-centered impact. These tests demonstrated the benefit of load sharing between the chest and shoulders, which was accomplished through load distribution over the rim, spoke, and hub surfaces of the steering wheel. The EA steering system was introduced in 1967-model vehicles. The final system included a compressible ball-sleeve column, a steering wheel with improved load distribution and stiffness, and an anti-intrusion mounting bracket to reduce rear? ward motion of the steering system resulting from crush of the engine compartment. When the load of the driver on the steering wheel exceeds the compressive force of the energy-absorbing element, the column slips out of the shear capsule, com? presses, and absorbs energy. This system has proved effective in saving lives and reducing injuries. An evaluation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (4) found the overall risk of driver fatality in a frontal crash reduced by 12 percent since the introduction of the EA steering system. The risk of serious injury (including fatality) specifically from contact with the steering assembly was reduced by 38 percent. More recent safety developments of the steering system have focused on the steering wheel to improve protection of the face of the lap-shoulder- belted driver, and the abdomen of the unrestrained driver, and on better methods of assessing crash protection. High-Penetration-Resistant Windshield Injury research during the early 1960s indicated that the windshield glass in use was a possible source of deep facial laceration. These windshields were constructed of two glass layers with a thin (0.38-mm or 0.15-in) layer of plastic tightly bonded between them. The laminated glass was thus fairly brittle and would break and be pene? trated by the head in severe crashes. This often resulted in the face being raked against the jagged edge of the hole made by the head. A proposal was made that better occupant protection could be achieved if the head could be kept from passing through the glass during impact, while ensuring that the head would be safely decelerated to protect against concussion injury. Extensive collaboration between engineering and medical experts was required to determine an injury assessment procedure for the evaluation of prototype head protection systems. Evaluation of head protection systems was needed to develop a laminated glass that would yield under impact to increase the head's stopping distance, yet still resist head penetration at higher impact speeds. The collaboration resulted in a series of head impact experiments (5) and led to a weighted impulse criterion based on average head acceleration raised to the 2.5 power (A2-5; GSI = A2 5T) and impact duration to assess concussion injury risk. This so-called Gadd Severity Index (GSI) became a widely accepted method of head injury assessment in anthropomorphic dummy tests and was the forerunner for the current Head Injury Criterion (HIC). Other research (6) led to the development of a chamois covering for the dummy head, which provided an objective indication of laceration protection of prototype windshields. Eventually, cadaver impact experiments were conducted using various prototype windshields in simulated vehicle crashes. These tests showed that a thicker (0.76- mm or 0.30-in) plastic interlayer bonded more loosely to the two outer sheets of glass could provide a stretchable structure with greater energy- absorbing capability, while still safely keeping the head from penetrating the windshield at high- impact speeds. The optimum characteristics for occupant pro? tection were worked out in a joint effort between the auto industry and the glass manufacturer, so that it was possible to introduce the new wind? shields in 1967-model vehicles. Since then, the HPR windshield has proved remarkably effective in reducing injuries to the face while not increasing the risk of brain concussion. A recent evaluation by NHTSA (7) found a 70-percent reduction in nonminor facial lacerations and fractures through the use of HPR windshields. More recent safety developments of windshield glass have focused on (a) antilaceration inner shields, whereby a layer of plastic lines the inner surface of the windshield to further prevent laceration of the face and scalp, and on (b) a better method of assessing head dynamics and facial contact force during glass impact. The Need for Occupant Restraint Although interior safety in the form of energy- absorbing structures and load-distributing surfaces has achieved tremendous gains in occupant crash protection, the crush distance available is only a fraction of that which is needed to achieve safe November-December 1987, Vol. 102, No. 6 597</page><page sequence="4">'A lap-shoulder belt restraint system adds significantly to the effectiveness of the total occupant protection system. When used, seat belts reduce the risk of fatality by 43 percent and serious injury by 40 to 70 percent. . . ' occupant decelerations in high-speed vehicle crashes. Further enhancements of occupant protec? tion can only be achieved with restraint systems, which allow the occupant to take better advantage of the vehicle's crash-worthy structure. A snug-fitting lap-shoulder belt ties the occupant directly to the passenger compartment and allows that occupant to "ride-down" the crash as the vehicle's front-end crushes. This coupling and ride-down decelerates the occupant more gradually and over a longer distance than is possible with energy-absorbing interior structures, while minimiz? ing the more severe occupant-to-interior impacts. Belts are designed to distribute restraining loads over strong skeletal structures, including the shoul? der, rib cage, and pelvis, while minimizing the level of whole-body deceleration in recognition of human tolerance. Finally, belts provide significant control over the occupant's motion, particularly in roll-over crashes, and virtually eliminate the risk of ejection. A lap-shoulder belt restraint system adds significantly to the effectiveness of the total occu? pant protection system. When used, seat belts reduce the risk of fatality by 43 percent (8) and serious injury by 40 to 70 percent (9) in motor vehicle crashes. Air-bag restraints were developed to overcome the primary weakness of belt systems: to be effective, belts must be fastened in advance, usually by the occupant. Using a pyrotechnic device to generate nitrogen gas, a bag can be rapidly inflated during the early phase of vehicle frontal crash without action by the occupant. The bag then fills some of the space between the occupant and the interior, which couples the occupant to the passenger compartment and achieves some of the safety benefits of ride-down and load distribution. This coupling is only tempo? rary, however, because the bag must be vented and deflated, so that it will not act as a spring. However, injury biomechanics research (10) has found that the rapid development speed of an air bag can present a risk to those who may be close to the bag during inflation. Thus, air bag design requires a tradeoff between a long inflation time, to reduce the risk of inflation injury, and a rapid inflation, to quickly fill the space between the occupant and the interior. Because air bags neither remain inflated nor provide lateral restraint, seat belts are needed to adequately control occupant kinematics over the range of crash types. Occupant Crash Protection The current safety thinking is focusing on combinations of safety systems to further improve occupant protection in a crash. In this context, inflatable restraints are viewed as a supplement to seat belts. The lap-shoulder belts would provide the primary coupling to the vehicle and control of kinematics, whereas the air bag would provide the additional protection of load distribution and crash energy absorption in the more severe frontal crashes. This effort is part of the car industry's goal that new car development continue to seek improve? ments for the protection of the unrestrained as well as the restrained passenger. Although chal? lenging, strategies may exist for improving protec? tion for both by vehicle design. But as there is an effort to introduce more sophistication in safety systems, there is a greater need for sensitive measures of occupant protection to objectively determine the most effective combination of sys? tems (77). The resulting combination of safety technologies can work with crash-worthy vehicles and safe interiors to further enhance occupant protection. As our understanding of injury mechanisms and biomechanical responses expands, we are develop? ing more refined injury criteria and better anthro? pomorphic test dummies. The Hybrid III dummy measures more than 50 different responses to assess occupant protection systems. It is currently the most sophisticated dummy available for frontal crash testing. Efforts are underway to expand its capability to assess head and facial injury (72), and chest and abdominal injury (75). We are also moving rapidly to interpret injury risk as a continuous function of dummy responses rather than as a strict tolerance threshold. This approach recognizes the distribution in tolerance of the population at risk and the range of crash severities resulting in injury, and is leading to a scientific basis for safety engineering (14). Biomechanics programs are establishing the dif? ferent tolerance levels and injury patterns of 598 Public Health Reports</page><page sequence="5">expectant mothers, children, and the elderly, as well as the type of crashes resulting in their injury. In addition, we are identifying factors (75) such as intoxication and osteoporosis that influence impact tolerance. Finally, injury biomechanics research is addressing the issue of brain and spinal cord injury impairment and seeks to define the mechanism of injury and tolerance of neural tissues. This eventu? ally will lead to better interpretations of the risk of injury disability from laboratory tests with dum? mies. The goal is to provide the means to effectively evaluate safety systems and optimize their benefits for the protection of the driving public. References 1.
