Human volunteer tests were performed to determine the distribution of maximum upward articulation angles of the femur relative to the pelvis with the knee flexed. The average value for the 52 subjects that were tested was 1 22 degrees. This value was used to define the angle at which hip joints of adult dummies should begin to stiffen. The average value plus one standard deviation (122 + 13 = 135 degrees) was selected as the hip flexion angle which should not be exceeded when a torque of 340 Nm (250 ft-lb) is applied to the hip joint. The left and right proximal femoral-end castings of the Hybrid III dummy were modified to give symmetric ranges of motion that satisfy the hip flexion resistance requirements without affecting the lap belt interaction with the pelvis. Similar modifications are planned for the small female and large male Hybrid III type dummies. INTRODUCTION Several vehicle manufacturers have noted uncharacteristic high thoracic spine accelerations when evaluating driver and passenger air bag restraints using the unbelted Hybrid III mid-sized adult male dummy (1- 4). They attributed these high chest accelerations to premature interaction between the femur and the pelvis as a result of the hip flexion that occurred during these tests. Others have noted spikes on the pelvis acceleration curves due to metal-to-metal contact within the hip joint during femur-to-pelvis articulation. The Large Male, Small Female, and 6-Year Old Dummies Task Group of the Mechanical Human Simulation Subcommittee of the SAE Human Biomechanics and Simulation Standards Committee decided to investigate these concerns. To determine if the maximum hip flexion angle of the Hybrid III dummy is within the articulation range of the driving population, the task group reviewed the pertinent range of motion literature (5-8). Table 1 is a summary of the hip flexion data from these papers. The Hybrid III was designed to have a minimum hip flexion angle of 120 degrees (9) which is within the range of the data shown in the table. No upper bound for the hip flexion angle was specified for the Hybrid III. The task group was concerned that the various range of motion data may have been measured with the leg straight instead of bent at the knee which is more characteristic of the car occupants' knee angles during collisions. With the leg straight, the "hamstring" muscle provides substantial resistance to, and limits the amount of, hip flexion (10). To investigate the effect of knee angle on hip flexion, human volunteer tests were conducted by task group members at five test facilities. This paper summarizes the results of the human volunteer testing, the hip flexion requirements that were specified by the task group, and the modifications that were made to the proximal femoral-end castings of the Hybrid III dummy to meet the biofidelity requirement for maximum hip flexion while eliminating the possibility of metal-to-metal contact during sagittal plane hip flexion (11). HUMAN VOLUNTEER STUDY TEST PROCEDURE - The volunteer was instructed to lie supine on a flat rigid surface such as a floor with head against the surface, legs extended straight out with the calves and heels against the surface, and arms extended perpendicular from the torso with palms against the surface (Figure 1 ). The subject was asked to slowly raise his or her right thigh, leg and foot while bending it at the knee. All other body parts were to remain firmly against the surface to minimize pelvis rotation. The volunteer continued to rotate the thigh toward the chest as close as possible while keeping it in a vertical plane parallel to the mid-sagittal plane of the body. Then the test observer pressed firmly down and on the subject's right thigh with a steady pressure 1264</page><page sequence="2">and asked the subject to extend the right leg at the knee as far as possible without changing the right thigh angle. In this maximum flexed position, measurements were made of the angles of the thigh, 0T, and leg, 0L, relative to the ground. The procedure was repeated for the left side. A long, straight bar with an inclinometer attached was used to make the angle measurements. The mid-lines of the thigh and leg were used as reference lines for the angle measurements. These mid-lines are approximately the line between the H- point and the center of the knee joint, and the line between the center of the knee joint and the center of the angle joint. Hip angle, 6H, and knee angle, dK, were calculated using the following relationships: eH = 180 -eT = + Table 1 - Summary of Maximum Hip Flexion Angles Measured by Various Investigators Voluntary Forced Sample Investigator Ref.

Their hip flexion and knee extension data are given in the Appendix. One facility only obtained hip flexion data for the left leg and did not record knee angles or the ages of the volunteers. Consequently, left leg measurements were obtained for 52 subjects, 39 males and 13 females. Right leg measurements were obtained for 46 subjects, 33 males and 13 females. Table 2 provides a summary of the averages and standard deviations of the maximum hip flexion and corresponding knee extension angles for left legs, right legs, and both legs combined for males, females, and males and females combined. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS - There was no difference in the average hip flexion angles between the left and right legs for males (122.0 vs. 121.4 degrees) or females (123.9 vs. 121.8 degrees) and there was no difference in the average hip flexion angles for both legs between males and females (121.6 vs. 122.8 degrees). The average hip flexion angle and standard deviation for males and females combined (121.7 and 12.8 degrees) compare quite favorably with the measurements shown in Table 1 made by Sirelnikoff and Grigorowitsch (1 17.9 and 8.6 degrees) and by Dempster for medium build (117.1 and 12.7 degrees), muscular build (1 1 8.2 and 1 2.2 degrees), and thin build (116.5 and 8.3 degrees). This angle also compares quite favorably with the minimum hip flexion angle specification of 1 20 degrees which was used in the Hybrid III dummy design. Subjects with rotund builds had the smallest hip flexion angles, which is similar to Dempster's results. The female subjects had greater flexibility of their hamstring muscles since their average knee extension angle (128.0 degrees) was 10.5 degrees greater than the average angle for the male subjects (1 17.5 degrees). HIP FLEXION REQUIREMENTS Based on the results of the human volunteer study, the task group decided to specify the average hip flexion angle for males and females of 1 22 degrees as the angle where resistance to hip flexion should begin to increase significantly in the dummy. Also, the task group decided that the hip flexion angle should not exceed the average plus one standard deviation (1 22 + 13 = 135 degrees) when the hip joint is loaded by 340 Nm (250 ft-lb) of torque. For the dummy, the zero reference on the pelvis is the surface to which the lumbar adaptor block is attached (Figure 2). For the supine position used in the volunteer tests, this pelvic surface would be vertical. The reference line on the dummy's femur is the centerline of the proximal end of the femoral shaft. This line is 7 degrees anterior of the mid-line of the dummy's thigh. Thus, in the dummy reference system, the angle for increased resistance to hip flexion is (122 - 90 + 7 = ) 39 degrees. The angle that is not to be exceeded at 340 Nm of torque is (1 35 Table 2 - Summary of Averages and Standard Deviations of Maximum Hip Flexion Angles and Knee Extension Angles at Maximum Hip Flexion for 52 Subjects Hid Flexion Anales (Dea.)

A minimum angle of 46 degrees at 340 Nm of torque was proposed by the task group. However, it was noted that this value could be lowered if manufacturing and/or durability concerns required an angle range greater than 6 degrees at 340 Nm of torque. In addition, the task group specified that there should be no metal-to-metal contact within the hip joint for any angles from 0 to 52 degrees for articulations within 7 degrees of the sagittal plane. The task group agreed that these specifications would apply to all adult size dummies since rotundness was the only factor that had a significant effect on maximum hip flexion angle. HIP MODIFICATIONS To meet the maximum hip flexion requirement, the casting which is attached to the proximal end of the femoral shaft was modified (Figure 3). A notch was milled out of the anterior surface to allow greater angulation relative to the pelvis. A 40-45 durometer bump stop was attached to the milled surface to give the desired increasing resistance to hip flexion (Figure 2). The angle between the axis of the femoral neck and the axis of the femoral shaft was changed so that the femoral neck axis is perpendicular to the pelvis mounting surface when the hip flexion angle is zero. Since the pelvis casting of the dummy is asymmetric, different angles were required for the left and right femoral-end castings. The cap head screws used to attach the femoral head retaining flange to the pelvis were replaced by oval head screws. These latter two design changes minimize the risk of metal-to-metal contact between the femoral neck and the femoral head mounting flange and its mounting screws. None of these design changes involved the anterior surfaces of the ilia and, therefore, have no effect on the interaction between the lap belt and the pelvis. A detailed discussion of the evaluation of these modifications is given by Abramoski et al (12).

The average value was 1 22 degrees with a standard deviation of 1 3 degrees for the 52 volunteers that were tested. There was no difference between the average values for male and female volunteers. Based on these results, the task group defined the angle at which all adult dummy hips should begin to stiffen significantly at 1 22 degrees, and 1 35 degrees as the angle which should not be exceeded when a torque of 340 Nm is applied to the hip joint. The left and right proximal femoral-end castings of the Hybrid III dummy were modified to satisfy these hip flexion requirements while reducing the risk of metal-to-metal contact within the hip joint for hip flexion which is within 7 degrees of sagittal plane motion. Similar modifications are planned for small female and large male Hybrid III type dummies. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The task group is extremely grateful to the people who participated in the human volunteer tests, took part in the numerous discussions required to reach agreement on the hip flexion requirements and the dummy hip modifications, modified the dummy hip joints, and tested the modified parts.
