<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHO AM I? THE STORY OF ISAK DINESEN'S IDENTITY Thorkild Bjornvig Two Possibilities was not until late in her life that Isak Dinesen actually formulated the question: "Who am IT' Nevertheless, although not expressed in words, it was quickly implicit in her thinking, and the answers were given at an early stage. Two of them were clearly enunciated for the first time in the marionette comedy, The Revenge of Truth, the first version of which was a little play written for the family in 1904. She took it with her to Africa and back and finished it during a visit to Denmark in 1925. It is Amiane, a kind of fairy or witch in the play, who gives the answers. First she says: You are one of the ideas of Nature, and they are all wise. The woods where I come from are Nature's as well, they are her deep thoughts, and the cows in the pastures are good and pretty fancies. In her next lines she abruptly changes her theme, however. The truth is that we are all acting in a marionette comedy. - My children, what is more important that anything else in a marionette comedy is to keep the author's ideas clear. To act in a marionette comedy is a true blessing, and now that at long last I have come into one, I will never go out of it again. But you, my fellow actors, keep the author's idea clear. Aye, drive it to its utmost conse- quence. A human being is, then, both a marionette and one of Nature's thoughts. Are these two names for the same things? As put in this play, it might seem to be the case, but in reality it is not so, and in Isak Dinesen's subsequent writings it emerges that the two concepts represent two radically different views on human life and behavior, two distinct per- ceptions of human identity. While marionettes are related to an author, normally regarded as a human being, embodied thoughts are an emanation from nature, nor- mally regarded as a non-human being, if indeed, it is a being at all. Scandinavian Studies 57( 1985):363- 378</page><page sequence="2">364 Scandinavian Studies However, an author and an artist have something about them of God the Creator, or at least of a god-like being. Isak Dinesen's poem "The Ballad of My Life" begins: "An artist is the good God." And nature as well as the Earth can be felt and experienced as a god or goddess. But God, when conceived as an artist or author, inevitably acquires human, often too human, characteristics and qualities, while Nature and the Earth, when perceived as a god or goddess and as visible reality, preserves, deep down, something unalterable and mysterious. In a letter written to her mother from the farm, Isak Dinesen tells of an earthquake she has experienced. It was only a slight one, but it was the first in her life: I was in the bathroom getting ready for bed, and my first thought was that a leopard had somehow or other got into the loft; but when the whole house began to rock I had to think of another explanation. Although it is an unpleasant feeling in itself, there is something almost intoxicating about it when something you have considered lifeless starts to move. You feel as though you must pat the earth and talk to it and say: "Oh, so you are alive after all, my old Earth." Not only we, but also the forests are the deep thoughts of nature, and the cows are good and pretty fancies, says Amiane in The Revenge of the Truth. Isak Dinesen's favorite twentieth-century poet, Sophus Claussen, has these lines in one of his last poems: Are you wiser than the tree, the tree deep in the forest, sensing a pact with created things around, above, below? Surely the tree in the heart of the forest can feel the forest's soul. Don't you think the forest saw you with its silent thousand branches, though you yourself alone, with my eye resting on you? Do you think the tree cannot sense? Don't you believe the forest thinks? One of the characters in "The Deluge at Norderney" is a young girl named Calypso. In a certain tense situation she is standing with an axe in her hand at the bedside of her boy-loving, woman-hating uncle, intent on killing him because he has denied her existence. It is not casual or vaguely poetical when Isak Dinesen links the girl to "a limetree in bloom," an image she added to the later Danish version of the story. The</page><page sequence="3">Isak Dinesen's Identity 365 tree thinks - an attribute of human beings - while the girls blossoms like a limetree- an attribute of trees. For Isak Dinesen the connection between man and the manifestations of nature is essential. The relation- ship does not imply any disparagement of human beings, but it is indicative, rather, of praise. This attitude is clearer still when applied to the relationship between man and animals, and it is one of the most striking and unchanging elements throughout the entire corpus of her work. Identity From Wild Animals There are people to whom not only the sight, smell, and touch, but the mere existence of animals is an embarrassment and worry - and there are those who cannot imagine a life without animals. In "The Deluge at Norderney" extreme examples of these two types are confronted with each other in the persons of Calypso and her uncle. In her desperate attempt to appear as a boy among the other lovely, seraphic boys in the castle, Calypso has resolved to cut off her breasts. There is in the castle a room which no one ever uses. She goes to it and tries her axe on her little finger - when suddenly, in a long mirror hanging on the wall, she sees a large figure behind here. Turning around, she catches sight of an enor- mous old painting of fauns and satyrs, nymphs and centaurs. This is the moment that she is saved and fundamentally changed; in a flash she realizes her place in the totality of creation, indeed discovers that she has a place in it at all; she realizes that the young women in the picture, with figures exactly like hers, are adored and desired by these strange, odd and fabulous creatures. The account of this wondrously joyful experience is a key sequence in the story of Calypso. And it is more than that: here, conceived as a clash between two psychological types in a fantastic tale, we see one of the decisive and fatal divisions in western civilization. Not a clash between abstract ideas, but between basic sensual experiences. We read: She looked with great interest ai ihe satyrs and centaurs. In her lonely existence she had developed a passionate tenderness for animals. To the mind of Count August the existence of the brute creation was an enigma and a tragedy, and there were no animals at Angelshorn. But to the girl they seemed sweeter than human beings, and she was delighted to find that there were people who possessed so many of their characteristics.</page><page sequence="4">366 Scandinavian Studies At the time when the animals seem "sweeter than human beings" to Calypso, she is in a state of crisis. Though not in the same situation, Isak Dinesen always loved and praised animals, but in Africa she really met wild animals for the first time. It was an overwhelming experience. In tones reminiscent of Saint Francis of Assisi's "Canticle to the Sun," indeed a continuation and expansion of it, she writes, in Shadows on the Grass: Praise be to thee, Lord, for Brother Lion, the which is very calm, with mighty paws, and flows through the flowing grass, red-mouthed, silent, with the roar of thunder in his chest. And later she continues: Praise be to thee, Lord, for Sister Giraffe, the which is an ambler, full of grace, exceedingly demure and absent-minded, and carries her small head above the grass, with long lashes to her veiled eyes (p. 49). And not only did she feel wild animals as a sublime kind of sisters and brothers- she also saw them as examples. She writes: In very old days the elephant, upon the roof of the earth, led an existence deeply satisfying to himself and fit to be set up as an example to the rest of creation: that of being mighty and powerful beyond anyone's attack, attacking no one (p. 44). This was, she adds bitterly, in the time before this "manifestation of God was turned into an object of exploitation" because of ivory hunting. The fundamental reason that wild animals are examples, especially to human beings, is that they conform exactly to God's ideas and become what he means them to be. They do not interfere with God's plan, as human beings, under constraint or of their own volition, all too often do. This is the theme in "Peter and Rosa" from Winter's Tales. The fifteen-year-old Peter lives at the home of his uncle, who wants him to be a clergyman. But Peter wants to go to sea. In a conversation at night alone with his uncle's daughter, who is the same age as he, he declares to her that this is what God intends for him, for God has intentions with everything he has created, from stars and trees to beasts and birds; they are examples to be understood and followed. Then he takes a more modest wild animal as a proof and model for his line of reasoning:</page><page sequence="5">Isak Dinesen's Identity 367 I saw a fox the other day by the brook in the birch wood. He looked at me, and moved his tail a little. I reflected, as I looked back at him, that he does excellently well at being a fox, such as God meant him to be. All that he makes or thinks is just foxlike, there is nothing in him, from his ears to his brush, which God did not wish to be there, and he will not interfere with the plan of God. When a creature on this earth is fulfilling God's plan, identity is no problem. There is no rift, no vacuum, in the limetree, the fox, or the elephant to generate this question. But if a human being, perhaps in need, perhaps from a surplus of energy and lust, attempts to achieve the same certainty about his own condition and ability, he has the possibility of proceeding a step further. Not only can he use the wild animal in its integrity as an example, but he can identify with it. This applies not to the tame, domesticated, and often confused animal, but to the wild animal. In Africa Isak Dinesen, together with her special friends, takes this step. In Shadows on the Grass she writes without reservation: We registered ourselves with the wild animals, sadly admitting the inadequacy of our return to the community - and to our mortgages - but realising that we could not possibly, not even in order to obtain the highest approval of our surroundings, give up that direct contact with God which we shared with the hippo and the flamingo (p. 19). And this applies also to her beloved servant Fahra: For Fahra although posing as a highly respectable majordomo was a wild animal and nothing in the world would ever stand between him and God. This was, to Isak Dinesen, one way to realize identity, to answer the question: Who am I? It happened in the real world, in Africa, when she was an affectionate woman, a magnetic center for friends and squatters, living with all the responsibilities for them and the farm. The develop- mental course of this insight was first the view that every being is a thought of nature, then an idea of God, and finally a manifestation of God. This was the case with wild animals and a possibility for human beings with the qualities and integrity of the wild animals concealed in</page><page sequence="6">368 Scandinavian Studies their hearts, giving them potential for direct contact with God and the fulfillment of His plan. Let us now return to The Revenge of Truth to examine the other path explored by Isak Dinesen. Identity from the Story "The truth is that we are all acting in a marionette comedy," says Amiane. And finally she adds: "But oh, my fellow players, keep the author's idea clear. Aye, take it to its utmost consequence." Then, she implies, you will find your identity, or, in the words of Isak Dinesen later in her career, you will discover who you are. But by that time, at the end of her life and with her major works behind her, living not as a young woman, not as a farmer playing with the idea, but as a great artist and famous storyteller, she had replaced the marionette comedy with the story. It happens in "The Cardinal's First Tale" from Last Tales. What is the reason for this fascination with the marionette comedy, which doubtless contains the seeds of her philosophy of the story? Certainly there was the sheer delight of playing, but there was also a kind of desperation. Just as Calypso in her nonexistence in the castle turns to animals, and as Isak Dinesen after a tragic shooting accident on the farm, her heart heavy with tragedy, said "I turned to the animal world from the world of men," so she turns to the world of marionettes. Neither the world of animals nor the world of marionettes was, in her opinion, anything for the kind of people or the class she had a grudge against, i.e. the bourgeoisie, the respectable middle classes. Curiously enough, one of the great poets of the century, Rainer Maria Rilke, shared this feeling, and in one of his Duino Elegies, the fourth, the most desperate and hopeless of them, he clearly states how much he prefers the marionette, the doll, to the bourgeois: Who's not sat tense before his own heart's curtain? Up it would go: the scenery was parting. Easy to understand. The well-known garden, swaying a little. Then appeared the dancer. Not him! Enough! However light he foots it, he's just disguised, and turns into a bourgeois, and passes through the kitchen to his dwelling. I will not have these half-filled masks! No, no, rather the doll. That's full. (Duino Elegies, p. 49)</page><page sequence="7">Isak Dinesen's Identity 369 Because the doll is empty, perfectly empty, it can like the poet be filled with the breath of inspiration, like the mystic with the unknown God, like the wise man with insight, and like the dancer with the spirit of dance. True emptiness is the necessary precondition, and to the doll in Rilke's elegy comes the angel to fill and move it. And, as the triumphant line then has it: "Angel and doll! Then there's at last a play." To abandon the half-filled, respectable place and occupation in ordinary life and become a doll, a marionette, in the tragedy or comedy of existence is, to Isak Dinesen, one of the most powerful means of discovering the meaning of life and of realizing one's identity. This idea became more and more serious to her, as is reflected in the imperceptible transition from the part in the marionette play to its significance and role in the story. It will probably be difficult to find an apologia for the story- indeed, almost an apotheosis of it - equal to that which Isak Dinesen wrote in "The Cardinal's First Tale." A lady in black asks the Cardinal: "Who are you?" To him it is quite clearly a provocative and inspiring question, and he answers it by telling the story of his life. Thereupon he outlines a philosophy of the story which is clearly derived from the modern novel. He calls it "the literature of individuals." What happens to them is occasioned by their own mind and character; as far as it is possible they will fashion their own stories in accordance with their own wills and desires, and perhaps their own piteousness and weakness, and thus arouse the modern reader's sympathy and pity. But this will not be a real story; on the contrary, it will lose its impact and ultimately be dissipated. How different from the original story, the immortal story. This creates and immortalizes the hero, no matter what are his own qualities, what is his character or his temperament. There is only one condition: that he or she shall not try to influence their role in the story, even it if is to be tragic and terrible. To the lady, the penitent, this seems scarcely human, but the Cardinal maintains that the story is a divine art and therefore devoid of any irrelevant compassion that could change it - while the modern novel is a human product. He gives some famous instances of classical stories with tragic endings and concludes with these words on the genuine, the divine story: ". . . to its human characters there is salvation in nothing else in the universe. If you tell them - your compassionate and accom- modating human readers- that they may bring their distress and anguish before any other authority, you will be cruelly deceiving and mocking them. For within our whole universe the story only</page><page sequence="8">370 Scandinavian Studies has authority to answer that cry of heart of its characters, that one cry of heart of each of them: 'Who am F." The marionette comedy has an author, and the characters must keep the idea of the author clear. In connection with "The Cardinal's First Tale" it is interesting and significant that there is no indication of an author. "In the beginning was the story," says the Cardinal. Not an author. Not a creator. There is no word of a possible divine plan for human beings, for beings at all, and only human beings are important and meaningful in this tale. In view of the multitude of animals in Isak Dinesen's other tales, not to speak of her books on Africa, animals experienced in reality, as images of human characteristics and qualities, and as means to discover one's identity, it is striking and strange that only horses and dogs are mentioned in this tale, as cliches, as devices on a shield or pictures on a playing card. A bowl of goldfish is a comical exception, as conventional as a bird cage. There is not a single reference to a creature of the wild, whether bird or beast. It is clear that one way of discovering identity - by means of the divine story - excludes the other, of living according to God's plan, like the wild animals. However, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the philosophy of the story is generated by the great, established artist and storyteller, that it springs from this role in her life and not from her role as the farmer, the compassionate woman of flesh and blood, the sister of the lion and the giraffe, who pondered God's plan with her and sought to discover how to realize it. There is no record or indication that there was a risk of misunder- standing and hubris in the latter case- though there surely was in the former. It was anticipated in the tale "The Poet" in Seven Gothic Tales. The danger is that of applying the pattern of the puppet show and the story- this tale betokens the transition between the two- to the life of flesh and warm blood. This story is a protest against that idea and expresses a deep irony occasioned by it. The figure of the counsellor in it might feel he is in the hands of Shakespeare and Goethe. But the lovers, Anders and Fransine, have not felt or wanted to feel themselves in the hands of any author. The dying counsellor confuses his own plot with the great poets' plays; however, "My poor girl," he says, "everything is good." And he tells her that they are all "sacred puppets." He speaks generally and does not say in whose hands they are. Fransine makes no mistake, however. Now, at this unbearable moment, she realizes that she and Anders have been in the hands of the counsellor and cries as she kills</page><page sequence="9">Isak Dinesen's Identity 371 him: "You! You poet!" When this story is considered in relation to "The Cardinal's First Tale," the question naturally arises as to whether Isak Dinesen has repressed the theme, worked it out at a deeper level or simply given it more stringent interpretation. Or perhaps it could be said that she began with a caricature of the theme - the failure - and finished with the positive version - its success. No Identity At All Between these two extreme ways of discovering and realizing one's identity there is a third possibility: not to have an identity at all, and not to suffer from this lack, but consciously and resolutely to escape identity, and to experience this state as a relief, a permanent adventure and pleasure. This bold, indecisive condition is revealed in the theme of "The Dreamers" from Seven Gothic Tales. The principal character in the tale is Pellegrina, a superb singer at the Milan Opera, beloved and feted by everyone, the rich, the noble and the poor. She is badly hurt in a fire in the theater, and as a result of her injuries and the shock she loses her voice, never to sing again. She recovers physically, but in her deep despair she considers taking her own life because without her voice she feels like the living dead. Dead, because she was her voice, her voice was her identity. She tries to bring herself to commit suicide, but in the end she refrains and resolves to live on. This decision is the crucial point in the tale, the reason for the chain of events that constitutes it, and the starting point for it, though the account of the accident and of Pellegrina 's decision is delayed until the end. Pellegrina has a very special friend, a rich old Jew called Marcus Cocoza. From the first moment he heard her sing he has worshipped her, felt her to be a bringer of joy, and understood, as he says, "the meaning of heaven and earth, of the stars, life and death, and eternity." He has become her friend and bought her a villa near Milan. Because of her generous radiant expectations, which have met but scant response, she has always been deeply disappointed in love and has been somewhat ashamed of herself. When her affairs have finished she has turned to her friend and helper, and they have had their platonic pleasures and the sublime joy of being together. And thus they have lived in the white villa at Milan until the day of her disaster. During her illness and convalescence she is tormented by despair and the feeling that all joy and meaning in life have been irretrievably lost. In spite of this she gives up her intention</page><page sequence="10">372 Scandinavian Studies of committing suicide; a spark is struck in the darkness, and an idea for a possible way out begins to develop within her. She is dead to the splendid life she has known - but feels reborn to another. This new life is not a pale imitation of what she has lost, no compensation for it, but something quite different, something radically new and never before heard of. One day, early in the morning, before sunrise, she sends for her friend, and in the pergola outside the house she tells him of her thoughts: This disaster of mine had it happened to someone else - say now, Marcus, to a soprano of China, of the Imperial Opera of China, a hundred years ago - we might have heard of it, and not have thought much about it, or wept many tears over it. Still, it would have been as sad and as terrible. But because it happened to Pellegrina, it seemed to us too cruel to bear. This, my Marcus, it need not be, and it shall not be so for us again (p. 427). Now she explains to him how she will live her future life. He shall help her to tell the world that Pellegrina is dead, make a grave for her, and erect a monument on it. "Nobody," she says, "must ever be Pellegrina again. To have her once more upon the stage of life, of this hard world, and to have such awful things happen to her as do happen to people on the earth- no, that must not be thought of. No human being could stand the thought." He promises to do as she wishes. Below them, on the road, they now see some men and women going out to work in the fields. She points to a couple of the women and tries to imagine their state of mind : perhaps one is happy for some reason, and another unhappy for another reason. "What do you think of that, Marcus, you and I?" she asks, and concludes: not much. Thereupon she comes to the essence of her new insight and explains her intention: I will be that now. The time has come for me to be that: a woman called one name or another. And if she is unhappy we shall not think a great deal about it. ... And if I come to think very much of what happens to that one woman, why, I shall go away, at once, and be someone else: a woman who makes lace in the town, or who teaches children to read, or a lady travelling to Jerusalem to pray at the Holy Sepulchre. There are many that I can be. If they are happy or unhappy, or if they are fools or wise people, those women, I shall not think a great deal about that. Neither will you, if you hear about it. I will not be one person again, Marcus, I will always be many persons from now. Never</page><page sequence="11">Isak Dinesen's Identity 373 again will I have my heart and my whole life bound up with one woman, to suffer so much. It is terrible to me to think of it even. That, you see, I have done long enough. I cannot be asked to do it anymore. It is all over And you, Marcus, you have given me many things; now I shall give you this good advice. Be many people. Give up this game of being one and of being always Marcus Cocoza, so that you have been really his slave and his prisoner. You have not done anything without first considering how it would affect Marcus Cocoza's prestige. You must, from now, be more than one, many people, as many as you can think of. I feel, Marcus - that all people in the world ought to be, each of them, more than one, and they would all, yes, all of them, be more easy at heart. They would have a little fun. Is it not strange, that no philosopher has thought of this, and that I should hit upon it? At last she says that she and Marcus must part. He then proposes that he follow her and be near her, so that she can send for him if she needs a friend to help her. She consents: Yes, do that. Be near me, Marcus, so that if ever anyone should mistake me for Pellegrina Leoni, I can get hold of you, and you can help me get away. - But speak to me you must never. I could not hear your voice without remembering the divine voice of Pellegrina, and her great triumphs, and this house- and the garden. Then they part, and her new life begins with its different roles and love affairs, pleasures and risks. After the main plot there are, as it were, three subplots. In three different disguises and situations she meets three men: as a prostitute in Rome, as a milliner and revolutionary in Lucerne, and as a saintly principal of a village school and hospital. The three young men are fascinated by her and involved as in a matter of life and death, but in every case, when it comes to a decision, Pellegrina disappears without a trace. In his own individual way each of the three fails to recover from the impression she has made on him and the great expecta- tions she has evoked, and they all seek for her everywhere. Accidentally, or guided by destiny, or at the behest of the divine author, the three meet in a hotel in the mountains near a pass between Switzerland and Italy. They sit talking and drinking wine, and two of them tell of a remarkable woman they have met - Pellegrina in one of her disguises. From time to</page><page sequence="12">374 Scandinavian Studies time new guests arrive, and suddenly a lady and her maid pass through the room. "That was she," says one of the young men. But when asked about her the porter replies that none of the names they propose is that of the lady, adding that she has hired a carriage and has left. Now the three hire another carriage and pursue her. The weather is terrible. They are overcome by a snowstorm. The carriage sticks in a snowdrift, and they continue on foot to discover that her vehicle, too, has come to a halt, and that she has left it. At last they catch up with her and demand to know who she is. She claims not to recognize the three questioners. Confronted with three mirror images of three different women, three different images of her temporary identities in their minds, she becomes desperate. Every time she has been with one of them in the past, she has escaped at the critical moment and changed her identity. But now she is cornered. The three have seen a snakelike scar on her neck, a result of the fire at the theatre. Now they determine to identify her, using force if necessary. At this moment she runs across the road and flings herself into the abyss. She lies seemingly dead on a ledge, and with great difficulty they manage to drag her up; the old Jew has by now arrived in his coach and she is taken in it to the hotel. While she lies on a stretcher in a large room and they all keep watch beside her, the old Jew tells her story. He reveals not who she is, but who she was. In sketching "The Dreamers" I have begun from the inside, from the core. In reality the story is told as an enigma within an enigma within an enigma. When it is compared with "The Cardinal's First Tale," it emerges that the woman, who is no longer Pellegrina, does not derive her temporary identities from the stories in which she is involved, but from the new roles which she has assumed, indeed created. Yet Pellegrina had an identity. Where did she derive it from? She herself proclaims the answer when she asks Marcus, her friend and helper, to put upon the marble stone on her grave, in addition to her name and the dates of her birth and death, the inscription: By the grace of God With the perfection and magnificence of her voice, of her song, she has fulfilled God's plan for her. There can be no doubt about it: "The Dreamers" is much closer to major themes in "Peter and Rosa" and the African memoirs than to "The Cardinal's First Tale," as is also borne out by the references in it to wild animals. To begin with there is her name, Pellegrina Leoni, a subtle combina- tion of falcon and lion. The lady in black, the Cardinal's penitent, is not once compared to an animal. How different is the case of Pellegrina: she is like a young shark in the sea, like a winged lioness, like a python, like</page><page sequence="13">Isak Dinesen's Identity 375 an albatross, graceful like the wise and gentle gazelles, on her last flight like an angry owl on a branch, or like a crane when it runs along the ground to catch the wind. She is likened to a falcon, wild and mad with fear, and at last, when she leaps into the abyss, to a black martin as it launches itself from a slope or a roof to take flight. And on her deathbed, when she awakens and thinks she is Pellegrina resurrected, ready to sing in Don Giovanni, there comes no song from her, but only what is described as "a strange sound, like the distant roar of a great animal." That all these comparisons are not arbitrary poetical devices or mere images, but are intended to take the theme to its furthest consequence, is confirmed at the end of the story. There, Isak Dinesen lets Lincoln, the narrator and one of Pellegrina 's lovers, say, as he imagines what would have happened to Pellegrina if she had not died that night: In the end, I have thought, she might perhaps have decided to become a pretty little jackal, and have made herself a den on the plain, or upon the slope of a hill. I have imagined that so vividly that on a moonlit night I have believed that I heard her voice amongst the hills. And I have seen here, then, running about, playing with her own small graceful shadow, having a little ease of heart, a little fun (p. 440). Ultimate Identity Finally, how did these different concepts of identity work out in Isak Dinesen's own life? In the course of a discussion about "The Dreamers" I once said to her: "You are Pellegrina." She answered "Yes, I am," adding: "The loss of her voice corresponds to my loss of the farm and Africa." Next she expounded on how it came to mean that she had lost her destiny and her identity, and that from that time on she had willed not to have a destiny, willed not to suffer under any identity. In turn I told her of the tremendous impact the tale had made on me when I read it for the first time at the age of twenty. She replied that this story was so powerful precisely because it was the first she had written after she lost the farm and returned to Denmark. "It is like a scream, a lion's roar," she said. "I could not write Out of Africa until the pain abated." As a storyteller Isak Dinesen had, of course, her private life. To me, before I met her, she was only the famous writer, indeed, so impersonal and famous that I thought her dead. However, during the time I knew her it became clear to me how many roles she played and how differently</page><page sequence="14">376 Scandinavian Studies she behaved towards different people. I often wondered at this at the time, but subsequently I have realized that it was a major reason why people formed such vastly different impressions and opinions of her, and that they could bitterly disagree as to what kind of person she was. Of course, her roleplaying did not go to such extremes as with Pellegrina, and it lasted only for some hours, a day or an evening of time. The very use of pseudonyms, after her time in Africa, is part of her role playing. If, at the end of her life, she had one recurring role, it was that of being a storyteller, like Mira in "The Dreamers," almost anonymous, forgetting her past in the indulgent passion for telling a story. Keats, in advance of his time as a poet, and still more advanced in his reflections on poetry, wrote in a letter from 1818, three years before he died: "The Sun, -the Moon, - the Sea - and men and women, who are creatures of impulse, are poetical, and have about them an unchangeable attribute; the poet has none, no identity." In the light of all this it becomes apparent that Isak Dinesen as a writer was made up of a mixture of extremely modern and extremely archaic elements. But, in contrast to Keats and Mira, she suffered at times from a terrible hubris. In the beginning was the story; such is the Cardinal's thesis - and hers. But who makes the story? Not God, but a human being, previously anonymous, forgotten like the builders of the pyramids and the first cathedrals, but now whether or not his or her work is appreciated, a real person whose name is known. Now, as a maker of stories she was tempted to apply this fundamental ability of hers to make a story of life, involving living persons attracted by the magnetic field of her personality. She foresaw the risk, as is indicated in "The Poet" from Seven Gothic Tales, but as indicated above, she toughened and repeated the pattern. I, at least, have had it applied to myself. And certainly there is a great and moving irony in the fact that so many of her tales deal with persons who violate the essence and plan of the story in which they are involved. Or they let people and circumstances prevent them from acting out their role in the story, which is really the same thing. Indeed, it is the very theme, for instance, of "Alkmene." However, there was one thing in her life which I am sure was not a role: her concern for, and loyalty to, her real friends and the squatters on the farm. And, throughout her life, her concern and fondness for the animals. Here constant and close relationship to them, especially the wild animals, was not only an act of identification in order to achieve identity, betokened during her time in Africa by her determination to protect them and their habitat. In Out of Africa she has movingly</page><page sequence="15">Isak Dinesen's Identity 377 pictured the sad fate of the wild animals in the zoos of Europe and expressed her intense loathing of the degradation to which they are subjected. At the end of her life she was tireless in her efforts to defend animals against the torture of vivisection. With this end in view she embarked on profound and subtle lectures and articles, which involved her in painful and depressing discussions with scientists defending as necessary the use of experimental animals and reducing her profound understanding of and insight into the being and essence of animals to sentimental ignorance. She also made a direct attempt to influence the legislators who in 1952 were to revise the law protecting animals. She organized and collected signatures for a petition seeking once and for all the prohibition of experiments with dogs because of their close friendship with man. She failed - but she did succeed in one last action before she died: in turning the park of Rungstedlund into a bird sanctuary. There is in our civilization a deeply rooted suspicion of people who admire and love animals and believe they have rights; this attitude is seen as something exotic and strange, or anthropomorphic and senti- mental, or as a kind of spiritual sodomy. People of that observance cannot expect to be taken quite seriously, at least not in that respect. It was quite obvious that scientists with whom Isak Dinesen discussed her views were confused. How could a world-famous author speak as though animals had any rights, when human beings thanks to experiments with animals could be cured of all manner of serious illnesses? What she had written about animals in her works might well be admirable as mere poetry, fairytales, and fantasies, but how could such fantasies be employed as arguments to defend animals in real life, in our times? That was either foolishness, or sentimental ignorance, or lack of honesty. Yet it is impossible to ignore this dimension of Isak Dinesen's character and personality and still seemingly take her seriously. For here she is not acting a part, but feels herself to be fulfilling an essential part of God's plan for her. And I am convinced that it is no mere coincidence when, in "The Cardinal's First Tale," devoid of animals and centered on the story itself, she refers to Saint Thomas Aquinas, to whom animals only existed for the sake of man, to be used by man - while in her African memoirs, absorbed by her admiration and love for the wild animals and identifying with them, she refers to Saint Francis of Assisi, embracing them and including them in his Canticle to the Sun. And the next-to-last remark of Miss Malin in "The Deluge of Norderney," unexpected and seemingly without any reference to the final lines, is like</page><page sequence="16">378 Scandinavian Studies a distant echo expressing the feeling of young Calypso and the spirit of Saint Francis: I, too, was once a young girl. I walked in the woods and looked at the birds, and I thought: How dreadful that people shut up birds in cages. I thought: If I could so live and so serve the world that after me there should never again be birds in cages, they should all be free (p. 268).
