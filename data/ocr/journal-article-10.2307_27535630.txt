<plain_text><page sequence="1">by L. Robert Lind THE CRISIS IN LITERATURE V?Prophecies and Prophets PROPHECY is a treacherous and thankless pursuit. Many are the traps it lays for the unwary; even its triumphs are accorded little more than silence, while its failures constantly evoke the Biblical adage. Especially is this true in literature, where prophecy, in spite of its small repute, has continued to flourish. Each year sees a small harvest of mingled prognostica tion and lament about the state of letters; hardly a month goes by without its share of essays concerning the literature of the future. The value of such gratuitous vaticination bears a direct ratio, however, to the understanding which the writer who utters it can show of literature and its tendencies at the present time, for all reasonable prophecy takes its cue from the existing situa tion and attempts to divine how movements now nascent will de velop or how the literature of the future may avoid the errors revealed by its present form. English literary critics have been particularly active in the man tic arts; indeed, they have so good an opinion of their skill that they have produced an entire series of prophecies of every imag inable description in the small volumes of the "Today and To morrow Series". Here, with much wit and flippancy (but also, let it be said, with much owlish dullness), they have set forth their views on the future of art and letters. Each of these tiny volumes is designed to give space for only a few brief observa tions ; but these observations are not always wisely chosen. Take, for example, Mr. R. C. Trevelyan's Thamyris, or Is There a Future for Poetry?1 His faith in that future is indeed small and his words rather lugubrious; there is, too, much stuffy con aSee the criticism of this book by Herbert Read, Reason and Romanticism (1926) 68-71.</page><page sequence="2">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 67 ventionalism about his methods and some of his suggestions. He falls back like many conservative critics upon an analysis of pros ody which contributes little toward a reasonable conception of the future of poetry, based as it is upon obvious and trite prin ciples of syllable-counting. Few will warm to his suggestion that classical quantitative verse has a future in English literature; and when he deplores the lack of good verse narratives of the psycho logical sort, he seems never to have heard of Edwin Arlington Robinson. Furthermore, it is very doubtful whether a return to the dramatic interlude or dialogue is at all probable: Theocritus, whom Mr. Trevelyan cites, was a master in a type of poetry lim ited in its possibilities and adaptability. Besides, pastoral poetry, or any modifications of it, does not strike me as a form likely to attract the poets of the future. One can more easily sympathize with his hopes for philosophic poetry; but the total effect of Thamyris is quite disappointing. Where Mr. Trevelyan is dull, Mr. John Rodker, writing on The Future of Futurism, is irritatingly flippant and more than a little obscure. His booklet suffers badly, both from incoherence and a misleading title. Giving many quotations whose source he fails to record, he presents the world-view of Dosto?evski and the Russians as a guide for future literature. Admitting that "a richer, more adequate and significant language would seem to lie in the remotest future", he yet betrays a curious fondness for the abnormalities of speech revealed by the writings of the Stein Cummings-Pound school; these, with the admixture of the Rus sian emphasis upon pathological sensibility, he speaks of almost in the same breath with compliments to the French fondness for general distinctions and clear meanings. Out of such a farrago of incompatibles it is difficult to extract any plausible theory; one is forced to believe that Mr. Rodker really had none, and was merely fulfilling his publisher's request for a book. At any rate, one fails to see the exact connection between, on the one hand, the development of mental agility heralded by Blake, Mal larm?, Roussel, and, on the other, the sublimity of the bowels as adumbrated in the works of Tch?khov and Dosto?evski; both fact ors appeal mightily to the author of this wild little tract. One can scarcely say that Mr. Bonamy Dobr?e has written a more useful book in his Timotheus, or The Future of the</page><page sequence="3">68 by L. ROBERT LIND Theatre, a pleasant confection in the imaginative-allegorical style of the eighteenth century English essayists. It reminds one strongly of H. G. Wells, and gives us a no more trustworthy guide to the future than does any one of Mr. Wells' prodigious feats of imagination. All in all, one is disposed to give up the "Today and Tomorrow Series" as disappointing. More substantial and extended efforts at analysis are, however, at hand and may be profitable to examine. Professional teachers of literature have exercised their acumen upon the literature of the future; their learning and reputation ensure a certain degree of respectful attention for their prophecies. Of those available at present I select two: Professor Albert Gu?rard's Literature and Society, and Professor Ashley H. Thorndike's The Outlook for Literature. Professor Gu?rard is a nimble writer whose style leans far backward in the attempt to avoid academic stuffiness. The bar rage of epigram and sprightly colloquialism he lays down does not, however, conceal a certain thinness of thought. The numer ous parallels with French literature, from which the author takes most of his illustrations, are useful at times; but a consistent stream of reference and allusion to that literature, in the approved manner of the comparatist, does not always accomplish its pur pose, especially since the form of reasoning involved is merely analogy. His book is essentially an attempt to improve upon Hippolyte Taine's method of literary study; and, although Mr. Gu?rard is not blind to Taine's more absurd conclusions, he uses much of his terminology and gets very little farther in illuminating the connection between literature and society. It may not be too much to say the he carefully avoids any thoroughgoing analysis of that relationship, confining his remarks to such agreeable but scarcely major topics as Environment, Climate, Physiology of the Author Type, The Enigma of Genius, The Public, Literature as Business. It is true he also speaks of the Economic, Political, Social Environment of literature, the Influence of Literature upon Life, and Literature in Utopia. But none of these topics serves to clarify adequately the relationships they imply. Wherever the author has occasion to mention the Marxist or so-called socio logical school of criticism, he never fails to sneer in disapproval;</page><page sequence="4">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 69 but he neither grapples squarely with the principles laid down by this school nor presents a more reasonable alternative to their interpretation of literature in regard to society. Mr. Calverton and Mr. Hicks he may have read, since their names appear in his bibliography; yet he does not offer any convincing arguments against the results of their investigations. Part IV is concerned with a highly fanciful representation of literature in Utopia; the chief objection he offers against other Utopias than his own is the entirely gratuitous and unfounded contention that an appalling dullness will characterize the litera ture which will come into existence in a classless and static society, free from all conflict. The intellectual defeatism of Aldous Hux ley as expressed in the Fortnightly Review for December, 1930, may be read into these passages in Literature and Society. At any rate, it is obvious that Mr. Gu?rard's private Utopia bears no sensible resemblance to an existing Communist state nor to any approximation of the ideal society yet conceived by the mind of man. To regard his witticisms on this topic as so much pleas ant but absurd moonshine is our only conclusion, as, indeed, it is also Mr. Gu?rard's conclusion; for his Utopia is a projection of the imagination alone and has no roots in current movements toward a new society. His ideal state possesses class distinctions in a scale based on literary taste, each class in constant emulation of the one above it, for all the world exactly like capitalism. A series of geographical and social aspects are sketched in with a light touch; but the net effect is nonsense. In the end, however, Mr. Gu?rard capitulates so far to reason and reality as to admit that "The opposition of aesthetes to such causes as pacifism, simplified spelling, a reformed calendar, an international language, world organization, a planned economy, is founded on a crude conception of art. Art under Utopia will simply be more dis interested and more refined than it is at present." One wonders how "a planned economy" slipped into this group of b?tes noire. Professor Thorndike's book is by no means so witty, pretentious, nor provoking; its style and conclusions are cautiously conven tional, in the time-honored method of the skilled lecturer to ladies' cultural uplift clubs. There is little pompous erudition, no state ment to challenge cavil; but there is perhaps too much obvious and elementary explanation. In this mild scholarly view of the</page><page sequence="5">70 by L. ROBERT LIND world of letters from the study window there is nothing to excite either great interest or adverse criticism. From a reading of it one perceives that the author approaches his subject with love, enthusiasm, boundless optimism. He is deeply impressed by the tremendous volume of indiscriminate reading now done in the world and he looks upon it with some admiration, with, perhaps, the feeling that no matter what the quality, the quantity of lit erature produced and consumed has its advantages; even the masterpieces of the Saturday Evening Post find their place with in the range of his catholic approval. In more serious moments, the author expresses a belief that literature, in ways sufficiently analyzed, will come to have a great er influence upon society. The growing knowledge of the English language throughout the world, the increasing number of transla tions into English of foreign books, will have their effect upon the social and ethical consciousness; more criticism, more novels, more writing of an informative and reference nature are to be expected. Literature as an internationalizing force is a subject dear to the author's heart; here he grows more optimistic than ever, oblivious to the demonstrated failure of literature to im prove international understanding, peace, or progress. While literature helps to bring together the isolated, the far distant, as the radio, trade, and travel do, it has yet to show how it can pro mote to any considerable degree that mutual respect and sympa thy which make for international solidarity. The obvious con clusion is, naturally, that while economic rivalries and imperial istic ambitions rage without let or hindrance in the world, literary culture is powerless to bring about a peaceful state of affairs, as every historian knows. The writer's hopes for poetry are set forth in the statement, "Verse is likely to be employed widely in the future for other reasons than the desire for sublimity or ecstasy", a most salutary prophecy which, unfortunately, lacks reinforcement as to ways or means for its realization or any suggestion as to the very nature of these new employments. Certainly one can agree with his as sertion, "If we are to make a new world, we must make a new literature"; but both this world and this literature are left with out benefit of adequate comment. The truth is that, like Mr. Gu?rard, he is unwilling to approach the more serious aspects</page><page sequence="6">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 71 of the relation between literature and society; there is, further more, not the slightest hint in his remarks as to how this new world is to arise. The fervent hope of both professors is, one may surmise, that this world will come into being through a pleas ant, though very vague, process of inevitable gradualism, at least by an evolution from which all the rudeness, rumble, and blood shed of revolution will be miraculously absent. To be urbanely ribald, this is all quite in the spirit of that delightful anecdote told by Anatole France of the peasant girl who prayed to the Virgin: "0 Thou who didst conceive without sin, grant that I may sin without conceiving." It is not only to emphasize the unreality of the prophecies con tained in these books that this brief discussion of them has been undertaken; my remarks point to an absence in them of any use ful guiding principles, to a lack of knowledge of things as they actually are, the indispensable requirement for all reasonable prophecy. How helpless conservative criticism is to chart a new path for letters is suggested by their aimless nature; treading its way among well-worn dogmas, it cannot hope to offer anything genuinely constructive. II The mention of professional teachers of literature gives cause in this place for a contemplation of a rather large group of theor ists who, some years ago, gained much attention in the press for their teaching of a retrogressive prophecy, of, as it were, a pro phecy in reverse. It seems, at this late date, a work of supererogation to heap another burden upon the lacerated backs of the New Humanists. They have been accused of trying to found a new religion; they have been charged with prudishness; they are held guilty of all sorts of crimes against the human spirit, from atheism to sheer dullness. But if, amid the melange of hair-trigger criticism that prevailed a few years ago there is anything in respect to which they could have been said to be at fault, it was in making too much of a good thing out of their prophecy, in overpassing the great adage, "Nothing to excess". The New Humanists, with all their evident good faith and the undeniable value of some of their observations upon the modern scene, suffered from acute dichotomy.</page><page sequence="7">72 by L, ROBERT LIND In Irving Babbitt's excellent book, The Masters of Modern French Criticism, in the chapter on Renan,2 I find this criticism of that thinker: "Everything thus tends to assume in the intel ligence of Renan the form of an acute antinomy?reason and sentiment, the classic and the romantic, the real and the ideal, science and morality. He is unable to fuse together and reconcile these contradictory terms in the light of a higher insight. Instead of choosing between opposite and equally plausible conclusions, he sets 'the different lobes of his brain to dialoguing' about them. Such a state, if prolonged, would lead to a paralysis of the will." Here I find one of the greatest of the New Humanists describing the very fault I have to find with the New Humanists themselves. The very nature of their thought?a categorical insistence upon clear distinctions between the various genres of art and literature, and, although they give no intimation as to how this is to be ac complished, the clarification of confusion in the modern world apart from art and literature,?forced them to an extreme which made imminent a sterility of their entire power for good. The severe dichotomy between the genres which forms the thesis of Babbitt's New Laokoon, for instance, seems only to strengthen this impression of strain, of a criticism pushed so far as to recoil upon itself. The critic is forced to the expedient of calling black too black and white too white; he is led, in the fervor of his apostleship, to a dogmatic view of the object of his critic ism; what does not fit his purpose, furthermore, is mercilessly lopped off, and thus we have a remainder that is not at all in dicative of the former unity?the romantic art and literature of the last two centuries. The subtitle of the book itself?An Essay on the Confusion of the Arts?gives us a clue at once to the author's single-minded purpose; he has put the blinders upon his reader from the start, and so closely-wrought and so concen trated is the substance of his thought that we are led to admire in spite of ourselves the subtlety which has made us see in Roman ticism a multitude of bold iniquities we never dreamed were there. Now this may be very well as an exercise in critical counter 2I quote from the original form of this essay, the introduction to an edition of Renan's Souvenirs d'Enfance et de Jeunesse (Heath, Boston, 1902) xxvii. It re-appeared as Chapter IX of The Masters of Modern French Criticism (1912).</page><page sequence="8">CRISIS IN LITERATURE_73 point; but where there is so much smoke, I should like to see a bit more of the true fire i' the flint. There is something factitious about it all, like Lear, suddenly and petulantly oratorical, turning against Cordelia and as good as calling her a barbarous Scythian. Romanticism becomes, under the hands of its most formidable antagonist, a vague and gloomy monster, whereas the powers of rationalism shine ever brighter in the contrast of their samite robes. The little worm of dichotomy has bored its way through so many timbers manifestly rotten that we begin to fear that the entire structure will tumble at once before our eyes. It is inevitable that thought so akin to metaphysics should shut its inward eye to much that is worthy and lasting in Romanticism. This myopia, to return to Babbitt's strictures on Renan, implies, in his own words, "a paralysis of the will", but the will to see the beam in one's own eye of criticism. The truth is that the New Humanists were never so consistent in their criticism as their dogmas would imply. After a lifetime of patient toil spent in the endeavor to systematize his critical views and to armor them against all attack, there are as many contradictions in the books of Irving Babbitt as ever. In his inconsistencies he was true to human nature; but this seems to have been the chief bond the tireless tumbler-about of books had with the world of realities. While one school of critics held, in their attack upon the New Humanists, to a materialistic interpretation of life which amount ed to cramping dogma, while the religionists held to an equally impossible sentimental-humanitarian view that sprang from myst icism, the New Humanists, holding bitterly to their doctrines of "the inner check", maintained a type of theory as obviously im possible to cope with the complexities of life as the dogmas of the first and the wildly anthropomorphic dreams of the second of these groups of doctrinaires. Yet if this were all that needed even now to be said about the New Humanists, the task would soon be done and we should not have begun to notice their positive value as critics of the modern age. Despite their high Toryism, which lingered with such ten acity in the pages of The American Review, they seemed once to be the only set of critics in America who had a set of stand ards and whose "poesy is a gum which oozes" from some other source than their own emotions and subjective desires. It is a</page><page sequence="9">74 by L. ROBERT LIND sad truth that most American critics start from scratch and usually get no farther. They swing, as it were, from the shoetops, with out much deliberation or forethought, and their blows have tended to lose their force in diffuseness and prejudice; this way lies Menckenism. I do not mean to suggest that the New Humanists possessed a monopoly of all the bases of sound criticism. What I do say is this: for all their scorn of classical standards, the op ponents of the New Humanists seem to stand very much in need of those very standards which they have so vigorously condemned. It is scarcely a matter for doubt whether these critics could not profit from a scrutiny of those ancient pages with which they dis pense in the scorn of silence?Dionysius Halicarnassus, say, Longinus, the much-abused Aristotle, the Ars Po?tica of Horace, or even Boileau, to come down some centuries. Horace, among all those regrettable has-beens, is always ready with a cool word of good sense: Desqriptas servare vices operumque colores cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutor? Cur nescire pudens prave quam discere malo? In other words, it is to no one's credit that he is ignorant of the rules of the game. It was an obvious disadvantage in the eyes of the Modernist critics that the New Humanists were chiefly college professors and, therefore, of the academic tradition. Naturally, therefore, any critical dictum which issued from the halls of learning must have been tainted with dogma; nothing could be worth listening to which bore with it the faint echo of some dead giant's voice, some hint of Aristotle, a reminiscence of Plato or Cicero. Quite oblivious to the constant validity of classical principles, the Mod ernists were swept into opposing those who clung to them if only by the dire lesson of those School Men to whom the New Human ists have been likened. Yet there is a larger sense in which the New Humanists can be said to have erred, a sense in which they could justly claim as their allies neither Goethe nor Matthew Arnold, neither Eras mus, Aristotle, nor Plato. This was precisely in respect to their celebrated watch-word of the "inner check". In the concluding pages of his study in comparative literature, Three Philosophic</page><page sequence="10">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 75 al Poets, George Santayana8 writes in reference to the discipline of the true poet: The outer life is for the sake of the inner; discipline is for the sake of freedom, and conquest for the sake of self-pos session. Here we may join to the cardinal sin into which the New Hum anists fell, of being out of touch with life, the further error of misunderstanding and therefore misusing for their private pur pose a principle as old as literature itself, and one more simply and tritely expressed in the ancient saying about "liberty in law". There can be no value in a stern asceticism which does not put to any good use its self-imposed obedience to a convention. There is something of futile gesture in such limitation. The New Hu manists shut themselves up in a prison whose walls were severe, chill, luminous plane surfaces inscribed with all the reverent wis dom of the ages; but they were impotent to effect great good by the mere endless contemplation of perfection and by mourning the inability of modern life and literature to approach that icy excellence. It is well, then, that the New Humanists received a name which cuts them off clearly from any other school of crit icism; for their humanism has about it none of the warmth and life of that humanism with which the world is familiar in Plato or Goethe, Erasmus or Cicero. Surely the latter, in his Pro Archia or any other writings of his on the function of literature, never said that the poet should restrain himself for the mere sake of restraint, or that the orator should avoid the Asiatic floridity of expression because the Attic severity was more severe. It is the true meaning of asceticism as defined by the best minds of all time that one should hold to in discussing the New Human ism. If we conceive of asceticism as something active, perceptive, alert, as a discipline founded upon a rational contemplation of the expedience as well as the moral value of the action, the New Humanists stand convicted by almost every count of a false ascet icism. Because a real interest in human life implies a surrender, in part at least, to the stream of life, to sympathy, hope, and fear, they recoiled from this tendency toward what they regarded as Romanticism, having confused Romanticism with most of life 3Harvard University Press, 1927, p. 213.</page><page sequence="11">76 by L. ROBERT LIND itself as it appeared to them, and shut themselves off from all contact with existence except as they found it, woefully attenuated and shriveled and foreshortened, in books of erudite critical the ory. It is possible that the New Humanists might have been more keenly aware of "the still, sad music of humanity" had they been born poets, or, at least, like Plato, served a short and tur bulent apprenticeship in the art. The training they could have found in it would have forever saved them from narrowness and learned dogmatism. It must have been with some such vision of the end unobscured by the means, the vast whole undistorted by its parts, that Wordsworth, himself a self-acknowledged prophet, gave to all proud doctrinaires a high warning when he wrote: Denial and restraint I prize No farther than they breed a second Will more wise. Ill A consideration of the New Humanists increases at least one conviction: in the solution of the spiritual problems which con front the present age, both philosophers and professors cannot be denied their word. In fact, it is a heartening sign that philosophy tends more and more to apply itself to questions too long regarded as exclusively economic and political in nature and as best ex pressed in terms of the class-struggle alone or of the clash of op posing principles of social forces. It may be well, therefore, to turn to another philosopher and teacher. Se?or Jos? Ortega y Gasset has, in Spain and elsewhere, en joyed the great repute enjoyed by Paul Val?ry and Count Key serling in European thought. While all three thinkers have un satisfactory aspects, usually taking the shape of a vague intel lectualized mysticism and a tendency toward irritatingly general assumptions which resemble dogma, they have, when their writ ing is not too windy and magniloquent, a gift for probing to the heart of our perplexities in a way that goes far to condone their failings. Se?or Ortega, despite a too-great fondness for drawing his authority from German thinkers of all brands and an occa sional distressing lapse into the same curious subjectivity that renders much of Unamuno's Tragic Sentiment of Life so in</page><page sequence="12">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 77 complete and dissatisfying, is, nevertheless, firmly grounded in historical tradition; he draws many of his illustrations from Greek and Roman history and literature, albeit by way of German text books. He has devoted a large part of his surprising output as editor of the Revista de Occidente and as lecturer at the Uni versity of Madrid to an analysis of modern civilization with, I believe, some valuable results. It is true that his Revolt of the Masses, whose central point of departure is a significant observ ation of Werner Sombart's upon the gigantic growth of European population since 1815, justifies the criticism V. F. Calverton has made of its undue emphasis on the abuses of democracy without regard for the conditions under which those abuses arise; and it is certainly a tract against Communism which, by a simple sub stitution of terms, could as easily be taken as a counterblast to Fascism also. Moreover, one cannot accept his too facile explan ation of the failure of Communism to win wide adherence in Eur ope, namely, that it does not offer the masses a greater hope of happiness than existing forms of government outside of Russia; too many complex factors, including the military force and violent propaganda of Fascist and capitalist rulers as well as the total collapse of Social Democracy, must enter into the final decision here. But by deliberately reducing the political factor to a minimum in his El Tema de Nuestro Tiempo and approaching his theme from an exclusively philosophic point of view he has at least pre sented a discussion in general and objective terms. In order to provide a means toward more easily judging a work that deserves to be better known, I have summarized the argument of this book here in a condensed and perhaps too fragmentary paraphrase. I have throughout used the original Spanish text as it appears in the author's Obras (Madrid, 1932). Ortega begins by rejecting the collectivist and individualist in terpretation of history: i. e., the theory of mass versus individual, and substitutes the generation as a functional biological unit, since it represents a compromise between mass and individual. From this point of view, the reactionary and the revolutionary of the nineteenth century are seen to have much more affinity with each other than either has with us today. The generation is an organic movement which builds upon past generations in living</page><page sequence="13">78 by L. ROBERT LIND in two dimensions: accepting the past and expressing its own individuality at the same time. In certain generations, however, youth is subordinate to age; in other generations, the relationship is reversed in a sort of rhythm which metahistory (Ortega's own suggestion) might explain, on the analogy of physiology and the clinic. Certain generations fail to accept their historical duty and be come discordant with themselves. Such is the present generation in all Europe and especially in Spain. Radicals overemphasize the political factor; but political discord is secondary to differ ences of a biological, physical, historico-philosophic, ethical, and logical nature. "The destiny of our generation is not to be liberal or reactionary, but precisely to disengage ourselves from this antiquated dilemma." Prophecy is a part of history. Schlegel was right when he called the historian a prophet in reverse. But history differs from life in having no set of laws by which events arise: as, for instance, we know what sort of leaves and fruit a certain tree will bear but have less certain means for prognostication as to historical developments. By analogy, however, the Roman people were an example of the gradual unfolding of life under certain conditions, of which Caesarism was a generic form from the time of the Gracchi onwards and vindicated the prophecies of Cato. Psychological necessity gives a groundwork of unified develop ment to history, and insofar as history represents the probable acts of men under certain circumstances, prophecy is possible. Ortega is careful to point out here, however, that this view has nothing to do with Spengler's "historical prophecy", although it is hard to see the exact difference. It is clear that the near future is a prolongation of what is essential in humanity, normal and not adventitious, as a matter of psychological analysis. "Politics, for example, is one of the more secondary functions of historical life, in the sense that it is the mere consequence of all the rest [of the activities of life]." To this extent Ortega accepts historical materialism. The emerg ent epoch first influences thought, then action. Modern thought therefore provides a glass through which to observe the future: science, in fact, in the widest sense of the term. Our generation</page><page sequence="14">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 79 must concentrate on thought, not politics, if it is to fulfil its hist oric r?le. Scientific thought is closely bound up with each generation as its unified expression. But absolute truth is not compatible with the individual thought ["opinion"] of each generation. "The" truth does not, therefore, exist; there are only "relative truths", according to the relativist doctrine which characterizes this gen eration. But if absolute truth is thus rejected, relativism cannot take itself seriously. Relativism becomes, in amputating faith in truth as a radical fact of human life, pure scepticism. The at tempt to preserve the flexibility of truth hence fails; as Herbert said, "Every good beginner is a sceptic, but every sceptic is only a beginner." An apposite tendency also appears since the Renaissance: ra tionalism, which, in order to preserve truth, renounces life. Truth is invariable, not subject to the will of the individual. Rational ism and relativism, two opposing views, produce division in human society, nor can rationalism rescue us from becoming the consist ent victims of passing opinions, observations, conclusions whose anti-historic foe it is. Our errors arise apart from the Cartesian reason; the human will provides the infinite variety of history, which pure reason would make impossible. "History is substan tially the history of human errors." The thought of Descartes represents, according to the relativist theory made famous by Einstein, a new sensibility, a manifestation of a new epoch which looks forward to the future. Descartes' reversal of the accepted perspective in emphasizing the quantitative or geometric universe as against the immediate qualitative universe of the sense-perceptions has produced its re percussions in modern physics, and much wishful thinking has resulted in the four-dimensional physics postulated thirty years ago. The modern man is a Cartesian in his thought, and thus in revolt against the past; political institutions also a part of the p re geometric era of physics become the object of his antipathies like wise and he seeks to replace them with institutions derived by pure reason. Since the mass of humanity is incapable of this logical process, the Cartesian (modern) man rejects both past and present, projecting himself and his system into the future. Thus rationalism applied to politics results in revolution. Revol</page><page sequence="15">80 by L. ROBERT LIND utionary thought rejects the past, the "vital" reason of history. Legislation for the future, as exemplified by the French in 1790, seems to us crude and narrow. Mathematical principles cannot govern our more complex life. Absolutism remains even when the prince is guillotined and principle substituted for him. This clash between rationalism and relativism is the dilemma of our time. The fact that thought as well as breathing is a biological func tion tends rather to confute this dichotomy of view and serves to bring us out of the dilemma. The human will striving in moral choice for the good?conceived of as the service of God, of the ego, or of the greatest possible number of human beings?im plies a norm outside of ourselves. Both will and intellectual pro cesses reveal a dualism comprised of both rationalism and relat ivism, subjective and objective norms, which man must preserve in order to preserve life itself. The cultural activities of society also arise from the biologic sphere, but these in turn have a value in themselves apart from their biological usefulness : justice, truth, moral rectitude, beauty are, as it were, the end-products of such vital cultural activities. That value in itself possessed by these end-products we call "spirituality", what the Greeks called nous as opposed to psyche. Rationalism tries to cut away this bio logical basis of culture; a reason which disclaims an identity as a vital function among others is a mere cold abstraction. Life and the spiritual are one. The two phases of the vital human phenomenon (Ortega's vague phrase), biology and spirituality, obey two powers: biological necessity and the ultravital principle of laws of logic. The new sensibility subordinates spirituality to biological function. The double imperative derived from this situation is the following: life must be cultured but culture must be vital. The disequili brium between these two leads to degeneration: barbarism or Byzantinism. Liberal and democratic ideas proceed from a cul tural utopism which depends upon formalistic, schematic thought; they tend to become accepted without question in a mystical fash ion. The rationalism of the present becomes confused, antiquat ed, inertly traditionalistic. Since the Renaissance, culture has become increasingly a superficial, unilateral, fictitious sort of thing superimposed upon effective life. One comes to believe that</page><page sequence="16">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 81 he believes in culture, by a species of wishful thinking. English cant is really a European, not solely a British, phenomenon. The Oriental, not used to this separating culture and life, marvels at and scorns the hypocrisy of the West. The lack of loyalty to European culture has brought about the decline in its vitality, while science, ethics, art, religious faith, and law have by a sort of ankylosis come to hold an abnormal relation of superiority to the life they should normally serve. The "reason" of Socrates and his age supplanted the spontane ous element in life, producing a dualism which constitutes the true meaning of the Socratic irony. This emphasis upon reason con tinues through the centuries of European civilization until about 1700 when, after the systematizations of Descartes, Leibniz, Spin oza were achieved, reason begins to find its limits and the nature of its error. It is this period of cultural evolution which coincides with our generation, whose problem it is to reverse the relation ship and restore the true balance between life and reason. At this point occurs the passage quoted in Chapter IV, note ?; it is the most concise expression of the author's central theme. We now begin to suspect reason itself and to resent its pretensions to supremacy. This is the irreverent irony of Don Juan: pure reason yields to vital reason. From this point onward the argument takes the form of an elaboration of the central theme just referred to, and a survey of the negative and positive values of life, as seen by Christian and Buddhist, is presented. The former elevation in history of cultural values is regarded as a sort of Christianity without God, and the identification of culture itself with progress is pointed out. Culture for the sake of life, not life for the sake of culture, is the keynote of the present generation. This reversal of emphasis appears, for example, in art, which becomes a game without seriousness and in the great enthusiasm for sports which fills us today. The ancient hypocrisy of neglect ing the values of life itself produces a grave disorientation in a generation which exalts these values. While one may say more confidently with Goethe, "The more I think, the more evident it appears to me that life exists simply to be lived", it is more dif 4See Sewanee Review, Oct.-Dec. 1939, pp. ?.</page><page sequence="17">82 by L. ROBERT LIND ficult to find a new balance, freed from the hierarchical restraints of the culture of the past. As art becomes only a variety of foot ball, and sports take the place of the patient labor which, in other times, was expended upon the creation of works of art, the con cept of liberty becomes merely a formula and politics a matter for derision, not for the almost religious adoration shown for them by the men who swore the oath of the Tennis Court. Our entire perspective in art, science, and politics is radically altered. Culture, however, is not completely denied in favor of barbar ism; merely its claim to exclusive domination is denied. Its val ues remain intact. It has been regarded from within the limited systems and horizons of earlier philosophers, whose outlook we must now amplify with our own, in a world infinitely more com plex and disconcerting than our own. There follow two appendices which deal with the idea of revol ution and the historic meaning of Einstein's theory respectively, interesting for their application of the results arrived at in the earlier part of the book. Ortega neatly disposes of Marxian social ism and all revolutions (which he considers unlikely to occur in the future) by linking them with the rationalism he attacks and arguing, by historical analogy, against their success. This is a rather na?ve section of the book whose central fault lies in the attempt to fit historical facts into a personal theory; with these remarks we may bring the summary of the book to a close. Whatever the defects of this perhaps too-finely drawn analysis, it is evident that Ortega presents a contradiction between two world-views which it is our task to resolve. The emphasis our age is placing upon the values of life instead of pure reason may produce as distorted a view as that of the rationalists of the past; but it is the direction in which we are moving and, for good or evil, our destiny remains to be worked out in the light of a greater understanding of life in its social and biological aspects at least. European Fascism is now busily engaged in distorting biology and all culture as well into political propaganda; but despite the serious dislocations in cultural tradition produced by such bar barous antics, we may yet achieve, in those parts of the world still called democratic, an enduring synthesis in art which will</page><page sequence="18">CRISIS IN LITERATURE 83 provide the basis for a greater literature than is now represented even by the socially conscious writers of our time. IV I pass over two lesser works of prophecy5 and come to Stephen Spender's The Destructive Element. While not in any exact sense a prophetic utterance, it is of great interest as another defin ite expression of kinship which binds together the Auden-Spender Lewis group. Its point of view in regard to Communism is much the same, and with the same qualifications, as that of C. Day Lewis in A Hope for Poetry; but the emphasis upon a moral political world-view now imperative for the writer is stronger. Almost half of the book is devoted to an analysis of the pur pose shown in the novels of Henry James, who is taken as, in certain ways, the immediate spiritual ancestor of Eliot, Joyce, Yeats, Lawrence, and several other poets and novelists dead and living since the War. The central force of moral criticism and in ner dissatisfaction with civilization which impresses the careful reader of James's work?ignored, by the way, in Granville Hicks' The Great Tradition?is brought out in detail by quotation and r?sum? of his works, especially of the three last great novels, The Wings of the Dove, The Golden Bowl, and The Ambassadors. The progression of James's art toward the creation of a world of his own (usually interpreted as an escapist motive); his treat ment of the unconscious with its palpable influence upon Joyce; the subtle technical elements of his style and their resultant dif ficulties for the general reader; lastly, the profound indictment of our civilization which is the net effect of his work?all this is treated in the first sections of Spender's book. He follows the discussion of James with chapters on Yeats, Eliot, Lawrence. Auden and other less well known writers are commented upon in the concluding pages. What is most significant about Spender's critique beyond its very convincing presentation of the historical relationship between 8Robert Graves, "The Future of the Art of Poetry"; Hogarth Essays (New York, 1928) 163-193, although of interest, is really not concerned with the future of poetry at all but with its technique. The Future of the Novel, edited by Meredith Starr (Boston, Small, Maynard, 1921) is a series of brief and insufficient comments by 62 novelists, almost exclusively British, upon the prospects of their art.</page><page sequence="19">84 by L. ROBERT LIND James and later writers is its strong emphasis upon the moral choice between the art for art's sake, the personal legendary or escapist, and the revolutionary attitudes now available for the writer. This is shown in such sentences as these: If we hope to go on existing, if we want a dog's chance of a right to breathe, to go on being able to write, it seems that we have got to make some choice outside the private entang lements of our personal life. (p. 223) If I am right in saying that the struggle of Communism or Socialism against the anti-Socialist forces of the whole world exists, I think that the reader, in judging left-wing lit erature, must not judge it in the same way as he argues against Communism. It is not a question of whether he thinks the premises are false, but of whether the premises are about realities, in the sense that there are political and moral realities which are more enduring than the external world of literary realism. What he should ask is?Does this Communist approach lead to a greater and more fundament al understanding of the struggle affecting our whole life today? (p. 227) The writer who grasps anything of Marxist theory, feels that he is moving in a world of reality, and in a purposive world, not merely a world of obstructive and oppressive things, (p. 228) These sentences from the very interesting chapter on "Writers and Manifestoes" as well as the very subtitle of the book?A Study of Modern Writers and Beliefs?show a concern with moral purpose in literature that finds its fullest expression in the entire last section. The special contribution of W. H. Auden to the problem of choice which confronts the writer is discussed in a chapter called "The Airman, Politics and Psychoanalysis", and in Part III, "In Defence of a Political Subject". To the analysis of literary pur pose in Marxian revolutionary terms provided by other writers, Auden adds an analysis on the basis of psycho-analysis, pointing out the need for a change of heart in the individual, something as necessary for the new and better society with which Auden, Lewis, and Spender are concerned as the change in the ownership of the means of production desired by the Communist. It is a question, in spite of the entire reasonableness of this more inclusive view, whether Communism, as Spender seems to think, has ever so</page><page sequence="20">crisis in literature 85 completely neglected the psycho-analytic aspects of life in contra distinction to the merely economic aspect. At any rate, a change of heart is something far more vague, partaking far more of the mystical thought of D. H. Lawrence (the spiritual father of this young English group) and less immediately possible under any form of government than changes in the economic system, which, being made by man, can be changed by him. It is also quite pos sible that Communism, in those aspects of it most closely resemb ling a religion of conversion, does actually produce a change of heart as radical as any produced by great religious movements in the past. I cannot conceive of anything less drastic than a change of heart (certainly it cannot be merely a fear of punish ment, as assumed by the vulgar) which can account for the mes sianic fervor and deep self-abnegation under which Russian Com munists have lived for years.
