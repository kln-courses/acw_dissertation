<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews REVIEW ARTICLE Al-Ghazali, The Niche of Lights. Translated by David Buchman. Pp. xxxv, 80. Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1998. A work which, while terse, is of disproportionate importance for the study of medieval Islam, Sufism and Aba yamid al-Ghazall, has at last been made fully avail able in English by Buchman. It is presented parallel with the Arabic text in a single volume, in line with the format of the increasingly impressive Brigham Young University Islamic Translation Series. The Arabic is taken from 'Afifi's Cairo 1964 critical edition, but is given without the apparatus criticus. For over seventy years the only English translation has been W. H. T. Gairdner's - plentiful in both enthu siasm and chaos. Buchman's volume is by contrast measured and careful, and bene fits from half a century of Ghazali studies. The Niche of Lights is also of importance for Qur'anic studies. In his introduction Ghazali presents the work as 'an interpretation [ta'wll] of the apparent meanings [zawdhir] of those recited verses [i.e. of the Qur'an] and narrated reports [i.e. badiths] that allude to the divine lights, like His words 'God is the light of the heavens and the earth'... and likewise the saying of the Prophet: 'God has seventy thousand veils of light and darkness...' (p. 1). The work is thus explicitly framed as a scriptural commentary, with the second of its three sections taken up with a detailed interpre tation of the famous Verse of Light in the Qur'an, and the third section taken up with an interpretation of the veils badith. Ghazali's commentary on the latter turns out to be a private doxographical statement of great significance for gauging his real theo logical position and, as is well-known, contains some big surprises. Buchman's introduction includes a particularly useful survey of scholarship on Ghazali and the Niche of Lights, and discusses inter alia whether the doxography in the third section is authentic (pp. xxvii-xxxii). It was initially W. Montgomery Watt (in 'The Authenticity of the Works Attributed to al-Ghazali', Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1952): 24-45) who disputed Ghazall's authorship of the veils sec tion. Watt did so on a priori grounds - notably, the work seemed to him to accept the very Neoplatonic concepts rounded on by Ghazali in other texts, so could not be by him. Buchman himself sides with the later scholars (e.g. cAflfi, Davidson, Landolt and Lazarus-Yafeh) who refute Watt. It is surely right to take the veils sec tion as non-apocryphal, and inadvisable to reject a text simply on the grounds that it does not conform. But having said this, the problems this section poses for the stu dent of Ghazali are not to be made light of.</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 125 It is striking, to begin with, that Ghazali places certain nominal Muslims ('a com munity that says with their tongues: "There is no god but God",' p. 46) with athe ists and materialists, amongst those veiled by pure darkness. Ghazali actually places such hypocritical Muslims (merely motivated by partisanship, fear, or worldly con siderations) beneath non-Muslim communities veiled by darkness in association with light, such as idolaters, animists, star-worshippers, etc. (p. 47 ff.), who at least sin cerely acknowledge a deity in some sense of the word. This outspoken position is probably taken as polemically motivated, but with a traditional basis in the vehe mence with which the Qur'an itself speaks of hypocrites (mundfiqun) - to the point of apparently ranking them lower than unbelievers (e.g. Q.4:145). Of great concern in weighing Ghazall's own allegiances, is his apparent demotion of Ashcarites in the next grade up in his doxography: those whose perspective is limit ed by veils of darkness and light. Here, Ghazali sorts groups according to whether they are afflicted with sensory veils, imagined veils, or intellectual veils. For instance corporealists (mujassima) are afflicted by imaginal veils in their belief that God must have some sort of body. Next, Ghazali appears to see all subtler positive theologians (affirmers of God's attributes) as being subject to intellectual veils. By contrast, out right negative theologians ('those who avoid making Him known through these attributes' p. 50) apparently rank higher, and are amongst those veiled by 'pure lights'. Landolt (cited by Buchman on p. 67) takes this to refer to the early Mu'tazi la, and possibly Kind!. On the other hand, it seems beyond doubt that the demoted group of positive theologians - as suggested by Gairdner (cited by Buchman pp. 66-67) - are none other than the Ashcarites. The latter famously refused to follow the Muctazila in preserving God's transcendence at the expense of denying scriptural descriptions of Him. So it is, that subdividing this demoted group of positive the ologians, a slightly lower party are said by Ghazali to understand God's attributes 'in keeping with how they stand in relation to their own attributes' (p. 50). These were identified by Gairdner with the Hanbalites and early Ashcarites. A higher party of them (identified by Gairdner with later Ashcarites) sublate God's attributes and say (e.g.) of God's 'speech': 'it is like the speech of our own soul - there are neither sounds nor letters' (la huwa sawt wa-ld harf) (p. 50). However, careful scrutiny of the text suggests that it is not so much the affirmation of attributes per se in God which is the reason for even this last group's demotion by Ghazali. Rather, it is their crypto-anthropomorphism betrayed by likening the divine 'speech' to that of the human soul (ka-hadith nafsind). Moreover, it is clear that the negative theologians veiled by 'sheer lights' mentioned by Ghazali, do not simply negate God's attributes. Rather, 'they come to know the meaning of the attributes through verification (tahqiqan). They perceive (adraku) that ascribing the names 'speaking', 'desiring', 'powerful', 'knowing' and so forth to His attributes is not like</page><page sequence="3">126 Journal of Qur'anic Studies ascribing them to human beings...' (p. 50). Thus these people actually affirm the attributes - indeed they know them palpably through their own experience and direct perception (tahqiq, idrdk). However, they treat the terms covering the divine attrib utes and their human analogues virtually homonymously, so removing from the for mer all taint of comparability and anthropomorphism. (An identical stance on the scriptural doctrine of the 'divine session', al-istiwd', is found in Ghazall's Ashcarite creed in the Ihyd\ See W. M. Watt, Islamic Creeds, Edinburgh University Press, 1994, pp. 73-74.) In this way, it was perfectly possible from Ghazall's point of view to affirm God's attributes as demanded by Ashcarism, and still be amongst the elite 'veiled by sheer lights'. Moreover, the mention of 'direct perception' in this context suggests precisely the Sufi-Ashcarite synthesis with which Ghazall's name is histor ically associated. Other problems centre on: (1) the extraordinary doctrine of the Obeyed One (al-Mutdc) in this section - an archangelic being which presides over the world and is easily mis taken for God; and (2) Ghazall's apparent support throughout the Niche of Lights for an Avicennian emanationist view of the God-world relation, rather than the Ashcarite creatio ex nihilo. Briefly on (2), a close study of Ibn Sina's doctrine of emanation suggests that it really amounts to an eternal kind of creatio ex nihilo. The existence of God's first effect proceeds in eternity without any mediation whatsoever, by a process of 'absolute production' called ibdd'. Ibn Slna never says that the emanation of this effect from God involves Him as its material cause. God is always consid ered as an efficient cause by Ibn Slna. If such a doctrine is echoed in a work by Ghazali, does it amount to such a serious violation of creatio ex nihilo, especially when any offensive taint of eternality is removed? On (2) it may be ventured against those who view al-Mutdc as amounting to the God of the Ismacilis (pace Landolt, cited by Buchman, p. 67) that it is ultimately unnecessary to suppose that Ghazali privately esteemed a group he so strongly criticised in public (inter alia on the grounds of their theology) in the Fadd'ih al-bdtiniyya wa-fadd'il al-mustazhiriyya and the Munqidh. Albeit that Ghazall's explicit reference to the Command (al-Amr) in mentioning this group here in the veils section might easily be taken as evidence that he has the IsmacIli theologians in mind, who were well-known for their preoc cupation with the reality mediating between God and the First Intellect, variously known as the Command, the Logos (kalima) and the Antecedent (sdbiq). As Ghazali says, 'They suppose that the Lord is the one who is obeyed [by the primum mobile] and that the Lord is a mover of everything by means of the Command (compare Buchman: by means of command)... Then, in the classification and quiddity of that [C]ommand, there is an obscurity before which most understandings fall short...' (p. 51). However, the doctrine of the Logos was not the monopoly of the Ismacilis in Islam, and it seems easier to take it that Ghazali simply has in mind any believer</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 127 (whatever their formal affiliation) who rejected the Aristotelian reduction of God to the primum mobile, yet failed to attain to a concept of God as absolutely transcen dent. Al-Mutdc is then the 'personal God' who presides over creation and from whom the Command proceeds, and is distinguished from God in Himself, the Absolute. This is a familiar Sufi distinction which explains many of the shocking utterances in which the mystic even somehow claimed to transcend God, i.e., the personal God. It is nevertheless unusual for Ghazali to refer to al-Mutdc as an angel (malak), as he does here. This seems to be rooted in the only instance of the term mutdc in the Qur'an, where it is traditionally interpreted as a reference to Gabriel: 'This is the speech of an honorable Messenger, possessing power in the presence of the Lord of the Throne, one obeyed (mutdc) and trustworthy. Your companion is not mad! He saw him on the clear horizon...' (Q.81:21). Buchman has provided fresh impetus to the continuing inquiry into a religious thinker as mysteriously complex as he was fundamental to his civilisation. He has treated the author and his text noticeably even-handedly. Ghazali's combination of the greatest heights of mysticism with a sincere adherence to 'orthodoxy' has tempt ed many of his occidental interpreters to approach him as inconsistent, at odds with himself. This is potentially to miss the central point, true of Ghazali and by exten sion of the whole religious civilisation he spoke for: that the mystical dimension is a deepening, not a discarding of the religion. Gone are Gairdner's excitable references to precarious attempts by Ghazali to negotiate the 'pantheistic abyss'. Buchman in his introduction stresses how deeply embedded Ghazali's mysticism was in Islamic norms, and how his Niche of Lights is both outwardly Qur'anic in having the Qur'an as its terminological and hermeneutical basis, and inwardly Qur'anic in being, in the end, about nothing but the 'principle of tawhid, the declaration of the unity of God' (p. xxxi).
