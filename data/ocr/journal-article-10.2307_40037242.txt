COUNTS Abstract The complexity of cultural exchange witnessed in the archaeological record of ancient Cyprus and its impact on the iconographical repertoire of divine images dedicated in its sanctuaries requires a more nuanced theoretical model than those currently in use. In particular, artistic influences broadly defined as Near Eastern, Egyptian, or Greek have often been isolated as evidence of ethnic divi- sion across the religious landscape of Cyprus, even within the same sanctuary. As a result, many Cypriote sanctuaries are interpreted as host to a pantheon of foreign and local divine personalities. Such an interpretation has proven especially problematic in the case of one divine type that features a male figure clad in a lion skin, mastering a small lion and brandishing a club. Rather than privileging for- eign parts over the more culturally meaningful whole, this article considers the value (and validity) of postcolonial theory as a model for examining the relationship between image and identity in Cypriote religion. While post- colonial critiques traditionally function within a modern sociopolitical context, recent scholarship has highlighted the relevance of postcolonial concepts such as "hybridity," "middle ground," and "third space" for the interpretation of archaeological data in ancient zones of contact such as Cyprus. In the case of Cypriote divine iconography dur- ing the first millennium B.C.E., a postcolonial approach suggests additional ways of thinking about novel identities produced in the context of local sanctuaries.* introduction: limitations and liabilities of ancient globalization In a recent article discussing the restlessness of cul- tural boundaries in the modern world, Nederveen Pi- eterse offers a characterization of cultural complexity through the lens of contemporary globalization: An English Princess with an Egyptian boyfriend, uses a Norwegian telephone, crashes in a French tunnel in a German car with a Dutch engine, driven by a Belgian driver, who was high on Scotch whiskey, followed closely by Italian Paparazzi on Japanese motorcycles, is treated by an American doctor, assisted by Filipino para-medical staff, using Brazilian medicine, and dies.1 In the context of the 21st century, as advances in cyber communication and information technology and the economic - even sociopolitical - interventions of nongovernmental organizations continue to con- struct a global community, Nederveen Pie terse 's reflec- tion on what he characterizes as the current mixing of "cultural elements and traces across places and iden- tities" is perhaps not surprising.2 But to what extent can the ancient Mediterranean be studied as a global community? Many of the recognized mechanisms of modern globalization find their roots in ancient practices of trade and exchange, with the result that various archaeological horizons are described as pe- riods of internationalism or cultural koinai across the Mediterranean basin. The impact of this discourse in Old World archaeology has most recently been reaf- firmed by LaBianca and Scham in the introduction to Connectivity in Antiquity: Globalization as Long Term Historical Process: Ancient empires were the original globalizing forces along with the spread of the world's great religious traditions. So powerful were some of these institutions that they could forcefully establish languages of trans- action, not unlike today's globalization and informa- tionalization through the medium of English The expansionist compulsions of historical states and em- pires may stem originally from their commercial trans- actions and "hearts and minds" - and purses - have historically been won before conflict and conquest ever enter the picture, suggesting that the corporate * I would like to thank Editor-in-Chief Naomi J.

COUNTS [AJA 112 and national "tyranny" of flows that is implicit in glo- balization processes today are not new.3 The concept of ancient globalization has been deeply embedded in the archaeological literature of the last several decades, which has sought to foreground cultural diversity and reconstruct the Mediterranean as a patchwork quilt of distinct units sewn together through trade and exchange, colonization, domina- tion, and even resistance. The recognition of cultural difference and interaction within a Mediterranean context has certainly produced positive results. In many cases, however, this same approach still treats culture contact as a linear process of diffusion and re- ception, and export and import. Despite changes in archaeological thinking since the 1960s, traditional culture-historical paradigms remain entrenched in many interpretations of ancient material remains.4 As a result, certain groups are assumed to be passive re- cipients of the movement of symbols and ideas (and presumably meaning) from more proactive groups that impose their identity and culture on the former without contestation. Owen notes that the various pro- cesses of Hellenization (and certainly Romanization) are often characterized along these lines, which assume that "the use of Greek styles and objects in some way indicates the adoption of Greek identity: that the styles used by people are necessarily related to their ethnic or cultural identity."5 Sweetman offers a similar view in her recent study of Roman Knossos.6 Perhaps more importantly, too often the very process of recognizing or identifying cultural influences assumes a purity of source or a coherence of meaning that is thin at best.7 In other words, studies of the "Mediterranean quilt" have privileged the bounded divisions of each patch and not the more dynamic spaces in between. Parallel to the development of ancient acculturation models based on globalization and internationalism, scholars are now addressing the "end of the Mediter- ranean" and the ongoing debates regarding its useful- ness as a tangible or even intelligible unit of study. The work of Horden and Purcell and the essays in Blake and Knapp's volume on Mediterranean prehistory are examples of this trend.8 The value (and burden) of questioning the concepts of culture, difference, and boundaries within a system as large and volatile as the Mediterranean is clear; it is equally clear, as Knapp and Blake suggest, that such studies are only meaningful (or even possible) when more specialized research can be integrated and contextualized within this larger framework.9 With this in mind, it will be useful to be- gin by reducing the scale to a much smaller unit - in this case, the island of Cyprus during the first millen- nium B.C.E. - and try to build a theoretical model for thinking about material culture and cultural identity in a place often described as a "bridge" or "crossroads" where ancient Mediterranean cultures converged (fig. I).10 Archaeologists working in Cyprus continuously encounter the material products of artistic, socioeco- nomic, and political entanglements to an extent that notions of cultural heterogeneity/homogeneity have characterized virtually every synthetic study of the island's history.11 In the search for a more sophisti- cated approach to culture contact, negotiation, and the social responses to difference, Cyprus offers an ideal starting point.12 3LaBianca and Scham 2006, 2. Sherratt (2003a, 53-4) pos- its a similar analogy for the eastern Mediterranean at the end of the second millennium B.C.E. 4 Hall (2004, 35-9) provides a useful critique of the concept of culture as applied to the ancient world by philologists, his- torians, and archaeologists, and concludes (rather disparag- ingly) that "the conventional understanding of culture among classical scholars is informed by anthropological theories that were dominant in the early decades of the twentieth centu- ry" (Hall 2004, 39); see also Dougherty and Kurke 2003, 2-6. Clarke (2005, 1-5,9-10) offers a more sympathetic assessment, focusing on the important advancements in methodology that characterize much of the archaeological literature of the last decades, especially in the realm of material culture. 5 Owen 2005, 13. See also the important contribution by Terrenato (2005) regarding Romanization. Such an essen- tialized notion of culture contact - where the Greeks spread their culture yet remain pure, with, as Boardman (1999, 190) puts it, "nothing to learn, much to teach" - provides the raison d'etre of Dougherty and Kurke 2003. Pitts (2007) confronts the problematic concepts of Romanization and Roman-native interaction in light of more recent methods in pursuing ar- chaeological identity. He argues persuasively that it is nec- essary to move away from simple searches for diversity in material culture ("diversity for diversity's sake") and search for identity-based archaeologies grounded (and thus eluci- dated) through social practice.

For that matter, what does a theoretical model based on a modern concept such as globalization add to our understanding of ancient Cypriote culture? Consider, for example, a monument from the seventh century B.C.E. erected at Palaikastro, northeast of ancient Kition on the southeastern coast of the island (fig. 2) . The monument consists of a pyramidal-shaped cippus of local limestone, crowned with a head, and bearing a three-line Phoenician inscription on its face that reads "this which Eshmounhillec, the sculptor, made for his lord, Reshef Sh [ed] ."13 The head exhibits both human and leonine features, resembling the Egyp- tian god Bes. The face is bearded, with large, open eyes and a rather grimacing, wrinkled countenance emphasized by repeated, parallel striations. On the one hand, this votive illustrates both the longue duree of interactions within the region dating back into the third and second millennia B.C.E. and the complex relationship between culture, religion, and iconog- raphy that characterizes much of the archaeological record of Archaic and Classical Cyprus. On the other hand, it reveals the predisposition of artists in Cyprus to appropriate myriad divine images and assimilate them into a local, yet multifaceted, religious tradi- tion. On its surface, the cippus represents a material by-product of a globalized culture on ancient Cyprus: here a sculptor with a Phoenician name has carved a votive pillar from Cypriote limestone, on which he in- vokes a Canaanite deity (Reshef) with the image of an Egyptian god (Bes). Still, as a theoretical model, the assumption of ancient globalized cultures is not an en- tirely satisfactory characterization. For example, while the description of the pillar, similar to the notion of globalization encapsulated in the opening quotation of this article, captures the variety of cultural forces at work in this particular moment/monument, it simul- taneously falls victim to many of the same generalizing trends that should be avoided. In both cases, a series of (seemingly) well-defined parts (e.g., English, Nor- wegian, German; or Phoenician, Canaanite, Egyptian) is privileged over the much more culturally meaning- ful whole. As is often the case, the descriptors used to reconstruct cultural complexity assume a purity of source and meaning to the extent that the potential for novel, hybrid identities is obscured. Thus, one finds that this Cypriote cippus appears under two separate headings within the Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae - under "Bes (Cypri et in Phoenicia)" and under "Reshef."14 Frequently, both modern and ancient notions of globalization presuppose the movement of ideas from a few large "lending" centers to smaller, outlying "bor- rowers." In the case of Cypriote religious iconography, for example, discussions often focus on Hellenizing, Egyptianizing, or Phoenicianizing processes as opposed to a Cypriotizing of Greek, Egyptian, and Phoenician elements. By focusing on the internal - or Cypriote - response to cultural diversity on the island, culture- historical paradigms that favor hierarchical systems of reception and diffusion in the interpretation of foreign influence are more easily avoided.15 While a concept such as globalization might lead us to recognize the multidimensional interaction of culture in zones of contact, it does not always account adequately for the productive capacity of that interaction.16 A shift in fo- cus from the movement of culture to the subsequent negotiation, translation, and "production" of culture seems warranted for the ancient world as well. The Master of the Lion in Cypriote Religious Iconography Hybrid forms and recomposed identities are perhaps the most distinguishing features of Cypriote cult dur- ing the first millennium B.C.E. The material remains complexities of island archaeology and the controversial no- tion of islands as "laboratories" (26-7). One should also ac- knowledge recent arguments against the idea of island cultural systems as more bounded (whether physically or ideologically) and thus more distinctive than other ancient Mediterranean landscapes (see esp. Rainbird 1999, 2007; Blake and Knapp 2005, 9-10). As Broodbank (2000, 32-3) notes, "[ijslands are tricky, changing places. In the past, they were seldom absolute- ly isolated from the rest of the world nor fully integrated in it." 13 Hermary 1989, 295-96 (Musee du Louvre, inv. no. AM 1 196 + AO 441 1 ) . The head and cippus, which are now in the Louvre, were both found in 1903 by Couchoud; the initial pub- lication of the complete monument is Hermary 1984. 14 Hermary 1986a; Gawlikowski 1994. Note that a similar overlap in classification occurs in at least one other Cypriote case in LIMC. Karageorghis (1988, 92 n. 39) notes the treat- ment of the ram-horned statuette from Meniko, which Leclant and Clerc (1981, 671) identify as "Zeus Ammon," while Le Glay (1986, 74) lists it as "identification incertaine," s.v. "Baal Hammon." 15 Already in 1986, Yon (1986a) emphasized the need for an "interpretation chypriote" in her important discussion of the evidence for Phoenician cults in Cyprus. l6Sweetman (2007, 66) , who applies the concepts underly- ing modern globalization theory in her sensitive analysis of culture change in Roman Knossos, expresses a similar senti- ment in her criticism of current Romanization models.</page><page sequence="4">6 DEREK B.

Sculptural dedications displaying a wealth of "foreign" iconography, as well as multilingual in- scriptions, witness an intense trafficking in artistic and religious symbolism. In particular, votive limestone sculptures, dedicated in large numbers in sanctuar- ies throughout the island, were a principal means of communicating with the divinity.17 As such, they often functioned simultaneously as thank offerings to ensure present and future prosperity and as sculpted proxies for continuous worship - a practice well documented in Greek and Near Eastern religions.18 Typologically, a wide variety of figures have been identified as either human or divine, based primarily on their accompany- ing attributes and their number and distribution within the sanctuaries themselves. Human votary types, most often recognized as generic facsimiles of the donors themselves (and less often as priests and/or kings), combine distinct forms of headgear (e.g., conical caps, "Egyptian-style" klafts, diadems, laurel wreaths) and jewelry (e.g., earrings, necklaces, spiral armlets) with an equally diverse array of garments (e.g., ankle-length robes, so-called Cypriote shorts, knee-length shenti, as well as chitons and himations) .19 A wide range of attri- butes (e.g., ornate headdresses, animal skins, certain handheld objects) , and the fact that they appear in pro- portionately small numbers in sanctuaries, distinguish divine figures from the more common human types.20 Finally, the gender of the deity worshiped within a par- ticular sanctuary is most often based on the overwhelm- ing preference for either male or female types (both human and divine) among the dedications.21 Among the divine images dedicated in Cypriote sanc- tuaries during the Archaic (ca. 750-475 B.C.E.), Clas- sical (ca. 475-325 B.C.E.), and Hellenistic (ca. 325-30 B.C.E.) eras, the type featuring a male god clad in a lion skin and grasping a small lion in his left hand occupies Fig. 2.

Representations, predominantly in the form of under-life-sized limestone statuettes, began to appear in the first half of the sixth century B.C.E. , as illustrated in an example from Idalion (fig. 3).22 From 17 Connelly 1989. The Cypriotes, lacking an indigenous source of marble, used local limestone for their votive sculp- ture. Cypriote sanctuaries have also produced an enormous corpus of terracotta sculpture types ranging from small-scale figurines to over-life-sized statues; the history of terracotta stat- uary is closely linked to that of limestone in terms of function and style. The use of local stone, combined with a separate and viable market for terracotta statuary, facilitated a votive sculptural tradition that favored certain media at certain sanc- tuaries. Sanctuaries located near the limestone quarries that skirt the Mesaoria plain in central eastern Cyprus (e.g., Tamas- sos, Idalion, Golgoi-Ayios Photios, Kition) have produced the majority of extant limestone examples, reflecting availability of material as much as fashion or ritual importance. The male divine images discovered in these sanctuaries of the Mesaoria (which are the focus of this study) are overwhelmingly found in limestone (Counts 2001, 153-56). For Cypriote terracotta sculpture in general, see Karageorghis (1991-1999) , covering the Chalcolithic to Archaic periods. 18 Connelly 1989. 19Hermary (1989) andMylonas (1999) provide catalogues of male and female human votary types; see also S0rensen (1994) and Counts (2001, 156-63) for general discussions and further references. 20 See esp. Hermary 1989, 294-320 (male divinities); 394-418 (female divinities). The relationship between ty- pology and divine status within the corpus of Cypriote lime- stone sculptures is discussed in S0rensen 1994; Counts 2001, 163-66. 21Ulbrich2005, 199. 22Pryce (1931, 82, cat. no.

The examples illustrated here from sanctuaries at Idalion (fig. 4) and Athienou- Malloura (fig. 5) can be dated to the first half of the fifth century B.C.E.23 An example from Golgoi-Ayios Photios illustrates the continuation of the essential typological features into the fourth century B.C.E.

A short, belted chiton closely contours the body, emphasizing the area of the groin where the out- line of the male genitals is clearly articulated. The fig- ure's head is enveloped by a lion skin; the open mouth of the lion frames the face, with the lower jaw split to either side. The remainder of the skin falls down the back of the figure, with the front paws draped over the shoulders and tied at the chest in the characteristic "Herakles knot"; the hind legs continue down the back side, terminating at the calves of the figure where the paws are shown attached. When preserved, the tail of the lion's skin can be seen between the legs hanging from the back.

They also preserve a common typological repertoire of limestone votive sculpture that is dominated by male figures. With a few exceptions, the type is virtu- ally unknown in sanctuaries on the western part of the island. Because of the ambiguity of contemporary epi- graphical evidence, the identification of the male god is by no means secure.

COUNTS [AJA 112 discovered, the figure is often referred to as Herakles or Melqart, without comment, or more cautiously as Cypriote-Herakles or Herakles-Melqart; in other cases, the iconography has been associated with Apollo be- cause of the presence of later inscriptions.27 As schol- ars have noted, such identifications are not without pitfalls.28 On the one hand, dedications to the Greek Herakles are absent from the corpus of inscriptions from Archaic and classical Cyprus. On the other hand, Phoenician inscriptions to Melqart cannot be unequivocally assigned to any corresponding sculpted images.29 References to the syncretism of Melqart and Herakles in Herodotus (2.44) and Lucian (Syr. D. 3) are equally ambiguous in a Cypriote context.30 Never- theless, while the imagery employed at Kition - a city strongly connected to the Phoenician mainland - may have been suited for representations of Melqart, in- scriptions at other sanctuaries to Reshef and Apollo where the type is also found (e.g., Tamassos, Idalion, Golgoi-Ayios Photios) suggest that at least some other Cypriotes knew him by a different name.31 Without any direct epigraphical evidence to connect this image to a particular theonym, it is perhaps better to call him the Master of the Lion. There is little doubt that the image represents a god; the lion-skin garment, the attributes of club and lion, and the "smiting god" pose of the figure are all consistent with divine status.32 The iconographic traits apparent in the Master of the Lion type are easily documented as translations of existing iconographical modes, common in the Aegean and eastern Mediterra- nean, into a distinctively Cypriote divine image.33 The particular combination of the lion-skin headdress and club are trappings familiar from the milieu of contem- porary Greek art, as seen in numerous Attic vases (fig. 7) ,34 while the use of the Herakles knot to fasten the front paws of the lion skin across the chest of the figure also finds its most immediate parallels in Greek art.35 Nonetheless, the juxtaposition of the lion-skin garment Fig. 7.

Based in part on bilingual inscriptions and the iconography of the sculptures themselves, the patron deity associated with the temenos ex- cavated by Lang at Idalion has been called Melqart, Mikal, Reshef, Herakles, Apollo (and syncretized combinations) , and even Adonis (see esp.

Both traits are familiar in Egypt and the Near East from an early date.38 The so-called smiting god attitude is found in Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt as witnessed in the wall decoration from Tomb 100 at Hierakonpolis and the Palette of Narmer, as well as the Fifth-Dynasty tomb of Ti at Saqqara.39 In the region of Syria, the scheme enjoyed great popularity from the middle of the second millennium B.C.E., where, Yon argues, it was transferred into a more symbolic representation of the triumphant king or god without the necessity of portraying the enemy.40 The spear-bearing Ingot God from Enkomi and an ivory plaque of a leonine figure brandishing a sword provide Late Bronze Age Cypriote examples.41 The persistence of the smiting god iconography into the first millennium B.C.E. is documented by numerous examples from north Syria and the Levantine coast, such as the famous Stele of Amrit (fig. 8). The stele depicts a figure raising his right hand in a smiting gesture and striding forward on the back of a profile lion. Significantly, in the left hand he holds a small lion by the tail and thus assumes the familiar iconographic scheme of the Master of Ani- mals.42 A similar representation comes from Carchem- ish, where a god with a bull-horned helmet grasps a lion by the hind leg while brandishing an axe in the familiar smiting god pose.43 Both reliefs offer important comparanda for the second significant feature of the type discussed here: the attitude of the Master of Animals. There is little need to review the immense number, variety, and significance of this representation. The mastery over animals - not only lions but also griffins, deer, rams, goats, and others - is omnipresent in the art and ico- nography of ancient Aegean and eastern Mediterra- nean cultures. The scheme, which usually features a central figure grasping one or more animals to either side, is found in Egypt and the Near East throughout Fig. 8. Stele of Amrit, limestone, ht. 1.78 m.

(e.g., the Stele of Amrit or the familiar reliefs depicting a hero cradling a mastered lion from Sargon IFs palace at Khorsabad) . Therefore, it is not surprising to find the Master of Ani- mals, as well as related images displaying generic man- animal fights, common in the repertoire of Cypriote art as early as the 15th century B.C.E. and continuing well into the Archaic period.44 The most striking par- allels come from a series of seals (possibly of Cypriote the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, dated to the early fifth cen- tury B.C.E. and attributed to the Semon Master.

COUNTS [AJA 112 manufacture) that feature a profile hero striding for- ward with club raised in the right hand, while grasp- ing a lion in the left.45 Finally, one should note the special iconographic relationship between images of the Master of the Lion and those traditionally identi- fied as Bes in Cyprus. A seventh-century B.C.E. silver bowl from Idalion depicts a bearded figure identified as Bes, wearing a spotted leopard skin and mastering a lion, repeated six times around the outer register of the bowl's interior (fig. 9).46 The iconographic paral- lels with Bes representations are significant but beyond the scope of this article; indeed, a newly discovered wall bracket from Athienou-Malloura, which features three Bes-like figures wearing lion-skin headdresses, striding atop two recumbent lions, and raising their arms in a smiting god pose (but without brandishing weapons), may provide a key iconographical link be- tween the two divine types in Cypriote art.47 As the product of artistic agency and religious trans- lation, the Master of the Lion is conspicuously familiar yet nonetheless difficult to label. The combination of varying iconographic traditions from the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean complicates the question of identification; it would appear that the ancient Cy- priotes freely borrowed the trappings of the hero/god in both his Greek and Near Eastern manifestations and integrated them into their own traditional reli- gious symbolism. Interpretations of the Master of the Lion in Cyprus have often been confined to studies of foreign iconographic influences, usually at the ex- pense of local contexts and distributions, resulting in a rather static conception of the relationship between iconography and religious meaning that fails to recog- nize the complexity of culture in a multivalent zone of contact such as Cyprus. Clearly, a fresh approach to the problem of the Master of the Lion's iconography is needed. While there is little doubt, as scholars have noted, that the origins and development of this image demonstrate a multiplicity of both external and inter- nal forces, its local adaptation to the specific needs of Cypriote cult must also be considered. POSTCOLONIAL THEORY AND THE CULTURE IN BETWEEN CYPRIOTE CULTURES Postcolonial theory presents an alternative way of thinking about the nuanced relationship between identity and image in Cypriote religion that has the potential to counterbalance the shortcomings of cur- rent interpretative models. The hallmark of postcolo- nial inquiry is the recognition of the ambiguity that arises when culture is taken out of the realm of binary oppositions. Grounded in the challenges of Said's Orientalism, postcolonial critiques traditionally func- tion within a modern sociopolitical context and have been primarily tested within the realm of literary criti- cism.48 Nevertheless, the potential of such approaches to the study of ancient material culture has not gone unnoticed. Over the last decade, Webster, van Dom- melen, Antonaccio, and others have highlighted the value of postcolonial theory for classical archaeologists confronting the complexities of cultural responses to contact in the archaeological record.49 In the context of her work on Sikeliote identity, Antonaccio has observed that the postcolonial framework "has great appeal for the study of material culture in an ancient contact or colonial context that moves away from binary opposi- tions between Greek and Other, and the essentialism inherent in interpreting every Greek artefact as the material trace of a Greek person, and vice versa."50 Postcolonial concepts such as "third space," "middle ground," and "hybridity" have been applied to a wide range of ancient contexts from settlement and coloni- zation to imperial expansion and conflict. While the emergence of novel identities remains an essential ele- ment to such studies, the processes by which identities are formed, and the material culture through which they might be manifested in the archaeological record, have increasingly taken center stage. The cultural theorist Bhabha, a leading figure in postcolonial studies, developed the notion of a third space as a means of foregrounding distinctions be- tween cultural diversity and the products of cultural difference. Bhabha's third space represents a space of 45 Buchanan and Moorey 1988, 73, cat. nos. 478-79; Reyes 2001, 153, cat. no. 374. 46Markoe 1985, 39-41; 170-71, cat. no. Cy2; 177-78, cat no. Cy8.

For further references to "Bes" in Cyprus, see Counts and Toumazou 2006. Similar motifs with Bes figures mastering lions (and other animals) are common in Cyprus (Reyes 2001, 81, fig. 138; 88-91, figs. 158-62; see also Markoe 1985, 39-41; 177-78, cat. no.

In the context of eastern Mediterranean archaeology, postcolonial theory has most recently been ref- erenced by Lembke (2004, 2-5) in her analysis of votive sculp- tures discovered in the Phoenician sanctuary at Amrit, and by Feldman (2006b, 59-71) in her discussion of "visual hybridity" inherent in the Late Bronze Age international style of the east- ern Mediterranean.

As Bhabha puts it, the acknowl- edgement of a third space forces us to question the reading of cultural identities as homogenous and uni- fying forces. He writes that this third space "ensures that the meaning of symbols of culture have no pri- mordial unity or fixity; that even the same signs can be appropriated, translated, rehistoricized and read anew."51 Bhabha's interest in recognizing the ambiva- lence of identity in zones of contact finds its roots in modern postcolonial encounters where the recogni- tion of a third space is meant to counter the fetishism of global multiculturalism.52 Nevertheless, Bhabha's third space and comparable theoretical concepts have been adapted and developed successfully by a variety of scholars to describe culture contact in various his- torical moments. For example, White has discussed Indian-European contact in the Great Lakes region (ca. 1650-1815 C.E.) through the notion of a middle ground, where cultural mixing produced new systems of exchange accompanied by equally new, shared levels of meanings.53 White's middle ground perspective on Algonquian-French relations insists on the multiplicity and mutuality of actions/ reactions in contact situations and, significantly, allows for the maintenance of certain aspects of identity concurrent with the fashioning of new ones.54 For antiquity, the multidirectional move- ments of culture and ideas and the multiple levels of meaning attending those transactions open the way for the creation of spaces in between cultures, even if the precise location and significance of those sites are difficult to uncover. Malkin, who draws heavily on White's work, argues that the Campania region served as a shared periphery for both Greeks and Etruscans, "creating a context of mediation and cultural perme- ability, a new 'center.'"55 The postcolonial situation 51 Bhabha 1994, 37; see also 1990. 52 See, e.g., Bhabha 1994, 31-9. 53 White 1991. 54White 1991, 50-93. 55 Malkin 2002, 152-53.</page><page sequence="12">14 DEREK B. COUNTS [AJA 112 within ancient Campania, where Greeks, Etruscans, Phoenicians, and local indigenous groups occupied a composite landscape, provides an appealing point of comparison to Cyprus in the first millennium B.C.E. In both situations, interaction among different groups takes place on a common - perhaps even neutral - playing field, where there is little evidence for direct conflict in the initial stages of cultural development and where polytheistic religious practices and artistic production proved open and even accommodating to outside influence.56 Likewise, by shifting the focus from points of origin to points of contact, the material manifestation of culture, such as divine iconography in a Cypriote sanctuary, can be appreciated not only for its mutability in translation but also for its ability to ac- quire new meanings. Significantly, the middle ground of Cypriote sanctuaries became a place where ritual practice and visual symbols helped participants main- tain, build, and even combine cultural identities. Hybridity, as it is commonly employed in postcolo- nial discourse, is intimately related to Bhabha's third space; it can be defined as the creation of transcultural forms in zones of contact that reject specificity and at the same time promote their own ambivalence.57 In his survey of postcolonial theory, Young has discussed hy- bridity within the specific context of agency and artistic production. In considering the genesis of the counter- cultural musical genre of Algerian Rai, for example, Young emphasizes that the artists themselves "took ele- ments from a wide range of existent cultural forms - sacred, secular, classical, popular - and represented them in ways that took them out of the conventional contexts into new kinds of cultural expression."58 Hy- brid forms deny direct access to original sources and, at times, may even redirect traditional views in a de- ceptively ambiguous interplay with the viewer. The rec- ognition of this hybridity within ancient visual culture shifts the focus from origins and streams of influence to genesis and agency, forcing the viewer to reflect on the results of contact and not simply the mecha- nisms. As a result, the concept becomes a powerful referential tool for contemplating artistic production, design, and meaning within ancient contact zones. The Master of the Lion type, with its complex array of symbols, represents an especially useful example of this phenomenon as witnessed in the varied treatment of the image in modern scholarship. In the complex repertoire of religious iconography, the ability to move beyond monolithic constructions of identity and ma- terial culture when interpreting the role of divine im- ages promotes the opening of cultural boundaries. As Feldman has observed, the overarching concerns of hybridity are identity and parentage.59 As we will see, the appropriation and translation of various symbols, in conjunction with a local desire to define visually the most significant supernatural powers of the divinity, underlie the hybrid form of the Master of the Lion type in Cyprus (as well as other hybrid forms so com- mon to Cypriote religious iconography) . Among modern cultural theorists, critiques of hy- bridity have been many and wide ranging.60 On the one hand, hybridity has been discounted as simply a new form of essentialism, since the assumption of pure, original cultures often underlies the search for hybrid, multicultural objects. On the other hand, ac- cording to some scholars, by shifting the focus away from the source of influence to the hybrid context where products emerge, we run the risk of subverting political, social, and economic inequities that surely existed in contact situations.61 In the case of ancient culture, it is worth recalling that interactions across the Mediterranean have always yielded some degree of cultural, religious, and artistic hybridization. Few, if any, would argue that perceived Egyptian, Canaanite, Phoenician, or Greek elements are not without their own hybrid foundations. Thus, Knapp and Feldman have noted the dominance of hybrid forms among Late Bronze Age artifact assemblages in Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean.62 Consequently, it is in the context of the longue duree that we should be study- 56Malkin (2002, 159) outlines the factors that opened up the middle ground in Campania. 57 Perhaps the most widely applied (and one of the more contested) terms from postcolonial theory, "hybridity" has been denned by Ashcroft et al. (1998, 118) as "the creation of new transcultural forms within the contact zone produced by colonization." As a theoretical concept, hybridity is perhaps preferable to creolization, which typically denotes a linguistic process while also carrying (less implicitly) the burden of co- lonial and postcolonial discourse with contemporary and re- flexive political implications (Ashcroft et al. 1998, 57-9, 118; Feldman 2006b, 60; van Dommelen 2006, 136; Sweetman 2007,66-7). 58Young 2003, 73. Bhabha (2003, 439) has also broadened the concept of hybridity to include artistic production. He writes, "the value of art lies not in its transcendent reach but in its translational capacity: in the possibility of moving be- tween media, materials, and genres, each time both marking and remaking the material borders of difference"; see also the insightful comments by Antonaccio 2003, 59-60. 59 Feldman 2006b, 62. 60Nederveen Pieterse (2001, 224-30) offers a detailed anal- ysis and response to the "anti-hybridity backlash." Van Dom- melen (2006, 138-39) points out several key objections to the concept of hybridity but ultimately defends its relevance by stressing the importance of situating hybridization processes within local contexts for the archaeologist; see also Terrenato 2005, 59-60. 61 Antonaccio 2005, 109-10; Owen 2005, 16-17. 62 Feldman 2006a, 2006b; Knapp 2006.</page><page sequence="13">2008] REPRESENTATION AND HYBRIDITY IN CYPRIOTE SANCTUARIES 15 ing the processes of hybridization and the interven- tions of cultures in between monolithic constructs. As Nederveen Pieterse remarks, "hybridity thinking also concerns existing or, so to speak, old hybridity, and thus involves different ways of looking at historical and existing cultural and institutional arrangements."63 Archaeologists should emphasize the productive capacity of the third space or middle ground to un- derstand fully the formation processes that produced the available artifactual data. In the face of lingering identities within Cyprus, the search for in-between spaces where people, material, and culture met seems warranted. As suggested above, conceptual tools such as third space and hybridity are especially useful for the analysis of Cypriote sanctuaries and religious ico- nography - places where the resultant material cul- ture emerges from a zone of contact that is neither purely indigenous nor purely foreign but somewhere in the middle. Considering the relationship between cult, iconography, and identity in ancient Cyprus, it is necessary to move beyond the simple recognition of cultural influences and examine the response to these various episodes of interaction. The applica- tion of a postcolonial framework to an archaeological narrative of Cypriote society and especially Cypriote religion highlights the complexity of exchange within dynamic zones of cultural contact. In this case, the products of interaction are isolated from perceived sources and assumed meanings, which should result in a corresponding shift in focus from external to in- ternal contexts. Dougherty and Kurke have addressed the process of cultural exchange in the ancient world more generally and provide a valuable analysis of its complexity: "in the multiplicity of practices, members of different subcultures confront each other, clash, reconcile, and contest value and meaning, and that contestation forms the material record that is available to us."64 This is especially true for Iron Age Cyprus, which witnessed settlement by Greeks and Phoeni- cians, as well as subsequent episodes of economic and sociopolitical interactions with a variety of foreign poli- ties. Moreover, an analytical tool such as hybridity has obvious advantages for the study of archaeological data where culture is materialized. In the case of the Master of the Lion in Cypriote cult, the characteristic iconog- raphy immediately signals the creation of a new iden- tity through the recombination and recomposition of existing referential modes - at once recognizable by its constituent parts, yet equally incommensurable in its entirety. As An tonaccio has observed, "the question to answer is whether what we perceive to be distinct modes in various forms of material culture . . . can in fact be said to have been distinct in antiquity."65 If the "core of postcolonial theory is an attack on any view of essentialism in culture," the recognition of third spaces, middle grounds, or in-between states within ancient social systems is certainly the first and most productive step to moving beyond the polarization of cultural identities.66 THEORY INTO PRACTICE: HYBRIDITY AND REPRESENTATION IN CYPRIOTE SANCTUARIES White introduces his discussion of Indian-European relations in the Great Lakes region with an analogy of culture contact that transcends chronological and geographical boundaries. The history of Indian-white relations has not usually produced complex stories. Indians are the rock, Euro- pean peoples are the sea, and history seems a constant storm. There have been but two outcomes: The sea wears down and dissolves the rock; or the sea erodes the rock but cannot finally absorb its battered remnant, which endures. The first outcome produces stories of conquest and assimilation; the second produces stories of cultural persistence.67 The themes of assimilation and persistence are common to most archaeological narratives of ancient Mediterranean interactions, and this is certainly true in the case of Cyprus. In fact, it would be easy enough to replace the characters in White's analogy with ones specific to Cypriote history in the first millennium B.C.E.: the island and its inhabitants become the rock, and Assyrians, Egyptians, Greeks, and Persians become successive waves crashing against the rock as the storm of history perseveres. As White suggests, such stories are not necessarily incorrect; rather, they oversimplify the complexity inherent in contact situations to the point that the whole story is not being told. He writes, "the meeting of sea and continent, like the meeting of whites and Indians, creates as well as destroys. Con- tact was not a battle of primal forces in which only one could survive. Something new could appear."68 Situated at an intersection of the ancient Mediter- ranean, trade and contact with Greece, Anatolia, the Near East, and Egypt guaranteed a constant move- ment of art, ideas, and people to and from Cyprus.

COUNTS [AJA 112 the island's long and dynamic history. In particular, the first half of the first millennium B.C.E. witnessed a series of defining moments in the development of Cypriote cultural identity. It is at the beginning of this period, in the 1 lth or perhaps the 10th century B.C.E. , that the social and political organization of the island is compartmentalized into a group of independent city- kingdoms, each under the authority of its own central- ized monarch.69 While the exact date of the formation of these kingdoms is by no means secure, there is little doubt that by the Archaic period (ca. 750-475 B.C.E.) , the physical landscape of Cyprus had been effectively divided into separate, autonomous kingdoms. The borders of these various city-kingdoms are difficult to demarcate, although some attempts have been made, and the issue remains critical to understanding the re- lationship (whether physical, political, socioeconomic, or religious) between the various urban centers across the island.70 Most scholars argue that at least two separate waves of colonization (or, at the very least, settlement) lie at the foundation of the political and cultural organiza- tion characteristic of the Archaic and Classical periods. The first involves the introduction of Greek-speaking peoples sometime during the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age on Cyprus (in the 12th and 1 lth centuries B.C.E.) .71 The second wave is tradi- tionally placed within the ninth century B.C.E., when Phoenician settlers from Tyre established themselves at the site of Kition on the southern coast of the is- land.72 Additionally, evidence for a third community, the so-called Eteocypriote group, is primarily linguistic and possibly represents a survival from the preceding prehistoric period.73 In light of the rich variety of material excavated in Cypriote tombs and sanctuaries, the ethnic identity of the communities subsumed by these political divisions has often been emphasized.74 The difficulty in recon- structing the nature and extent of local populations identifiable in Cypriote material culture during this period has been well documented.75 At the heart of this debate is the association of certain Cypriote city- kingdoms with specific ethnic identities. For example, the kingdom of Kition has long been recognized as a staging ground for Phoenician artistic, cultural, and political expansion across the island that eventually led to the takeover of the kingdoms of Idalion and Tamassos in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.; other city-kingdoms have been associated with Greek (e.g., Salamis, Kourion, Marion) or Eteocypriote (e.g., Amathous) communities (see fig. I).76 Archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggests some degree of heterogeneity among the various kingdoms.77 At times, however, this information has been isolated from other 69 For a recent, balanced appraisal of this period with rel- evant bibliography, see Iacovou 2002. The debate regarding the date of formation of the Cypriote city-kingdoms is well known to scholars of the Cypriote Iron Age. The more widely accepted model places the event in the 11th or 10th century B.C.E. (Steel 1993; Iacovou 1999, 2002, 2006; Karageorghis 2002, 115). Rupp (1987, 1989, 1998, 2005) has consistently argued that the city-kingdoms should be seen as an eighth- century B.C.E. phenomenon resulting from a process of sec- ondary state formation (see esp. 1998, 216-19). Stylianou (1992) remains the most comprehensive historical survey of the Cypriote city-kingdoms during the Archaic and Classical periods. 70 See, e.g., Rupp 1987, map 4; updated in 2005, 50. An in- teresting discussion of early attempts in cartography to draw the boundaries of the kingdoms is presented in Iacovou 2000, 2004. Fourrier (2002) also addresses the question of boundar- ies based on a broad range of archaeological and literary data. In her work on the sculpture of Idalion, Gaber-Saletan (1986) notes how the study of regional schools might elucidate the relationships between kingdoms (in that case, between Kition and Idalion) . Counts (2004) looks at intraregional systems of exchange and the relationship between cult and the bound- aries of the various city-kingdoms in and around the Cypriote Mesaoria. Reyes (1994, 101-21) discusses internal relations of the city-kingdoms, based primarily on ceramic and glyptic evi- dence, with some broader implications for the extent of ter- ritorial control. Obviously, any discussion of sanctuaries and territories, esp. in the context of religion, must acknowledge the pioneering work of de Polignac 1984; see also the impor- tant essays in Alcock and Osborne 1994. 71 Iacovou 2005, 127-31; 2006, 36-9. 72 Reyes 1994, 18-21; Yon 1997, 1999; Iacovou 2005, 131- 32. 73 A recent debate has emerged regarding not only the use of the term "Eteocypriote" to denote a separate population or language but also the very existence of a third linguistic stock among the Iron Age population in Cyprus (see esp. Reyes 1994, 13-17; Given 1998, 20-4; Petit 1999; Iacovou 2006, 42-4). 74 Iacovou 2005. 75 Reyes (1994, 11-22) provides a useful summary; see also Iacovou 2006.

Coldstream (1990, 52) also discusses the later for- mation of "Greek-Cypriote" communities (e.g., at Kourion, Salamis, Lapithos).

Most recently, Iacovou has questioned the extent to which the various Cypriote kings asserted specifically foreign or indigenous ethnic identities. Instead, she prefers to view their social and political negotiations within the context of a collective Cypriote identity, within which the various kingdoms were inclined to promote their individual personal- ity, be it Greek, Phoenician, or autochthonous (i.e., Eteocypriote) .78 Karageorghis has argued that in some cases, a "symbiosis of Greeks and Phoenicians" in cer- tain city-kingdoms created "hybrid situations" - a char- acterization that recalls the middle ground of White and Malkin. He cites, for example, the combination of a Phoenician inscription with a profile head of Athena on the coins of Lapithos.79 The recognition and emphasis on a collective Cypriote identity has a profound impact on the reading of hybrid forms found in Cypriote sanctuaries, to the extent that the role of perceived ethnic affiliations can be deemphasized when considering the appropriation and meaning of certain iconographical traits. To return to Kition, we are well advised to consider Yon' s comments on the Phoenician character of that polity; "the difference of the Cypro-Phoenician people of Kition from other Cypriots of the island is perhaps more linguistic than cultural."80 Nonetheless, foreign artistic traditions that coalesce within the matrix of Cypriote divine iconog- raphy are often still isolated as evidence of ethnic divi- sion among participating groups across the religious landscape of Cyprus, even within the same sanctuary. The resulting model disengages the evidence for rela- tive homogeneity of religious rituals and iconography associated with the various sanctuaries. Consequently, in the case of the Master of the Lion (where images have been found in sanctuaries throughout central and eastern Cyprus) , we run the risk of interpreting sanctuaries with similar images as hosts to different divine personalities. Faced with the complexities inherent in defining cultural identities in Cyprus during the first millenni- um B.C.E., scholarly debate since the 19th century has focused on the significance of the island's geographi- cal position. Since that time, the island's history has often been deconstructed as a series of foreign domi- nations by Greeks, Phoenicians, and a host of other emerging foreign polities from throughout the Medi- terranean (e.g., Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians). The impact of this tradition is readily apparent in much of the archaeological literature dealing with Cyprus during the first millennium B.C.E. Take, for example, the opening remarks of Nicolaou in her contribution to the international congress "Cyprus Between Orient and Occident": Cyprus due to its geographical position never ceased and never will in the future [cease] to be a "meeting place" and at the same time a "bridge" between the Orient and the Occident. In Antiquity, with which I am concerned here (Archaic-Roman period) , the Cy- priots never accepted passively this situation but tried always to make the best out of it and to be in constant relations with both the East and the West, the one scale of the balance, however, tipping according to the political situation prevailing in the island. For, as we know, during the Archaic period Cyprus came under the Assyrians (709 or 707-650 B.C.) . After a period of about a century of political independence (650-570 B.C.) during which the power and importance of the Cypriot Kings increased, a period which is one of the most brilliant of the Cypriot culture, Cyprus came un- der the Egyptians (570-525 B.C.). By the end of the Archaic period it submitted to Persia under the domi- nation of which it remained approximately throughout the Classical period (525-333 B.C.), to be liberated by Alexander the Great (333 B.C.) . After the death of Al- exander in 323 B.C. and the struggles of his successors, the Ptolemies of Egypt mastered the island for almost two and a half centuries (294-58, 47-31 B.C.) . All these events coincide with the Hellenistic period. From 58 B.C. to 395 A.D. Cyprus was under the Romans. . . . Throughout all those centuries Cyprus had a continu- ous commercial, economic, and cultural intercourse with the East and the West.81 Nicolaou 's text, while acknowledging the complexity of cultural interactions witnessed in the archaeology of Cyprus, can nevertheless be taken as representative of a common narrative that relies heavily upon the earliest syntheses of Cypriote material culture from the 19th century.82 Such historical narratives tend to downplay local contexts through their emphasis on foreign domination and influence. Thus, one learns from the most recent edition of the British Museum's overview of its ancient Cypriote collections that "the Archaic period (750-475 BC) was marked by a swift 78 See esp. Iacovou 2006, 53-8. 79Karageorghisl998,67. 80 Yon 1997, 11; "archaeology shows that Kition in the first millennium B.C. belonged to the same cultural matrix as the other Cypriot cities, even if in certain specific characteristics it differed from them - characteristics such as language and certain religious or funerary practices, which bound Kition more to the Phoenician cities on the mainland" (Yon 1997, 15); cf.

COUNTS [AJA 112 succession of foreign overlords: Assyria (c. 707-612 BC), Egypt (c.575-526/5 BC) and Persia (from 526/5 BC) ."83 The shortcomings of such views of Cypriote his- tory have not gone unnoticed.84 The inherent culture-historical approach embed- ded in many studies of Cypriote material culture has led to the unquestioned (and relatively unchecked) ethnic labeling of iconographic types and styles in Cy- priote art. In the case of Cypriote sculpture, the source of this art historical ethnic profiling in Cyprus can be traced back to Cesnola, who conducted a series of exca- vations on the island (ca. 1865-1875 C.E.) . Explaining the disposition of statues unearthed at the sanctuary of Golgoi-Ayios Photios in the area of modern Athienou, Cesnola wrote, "I was struck with the order which was evident in the original arrangement of the sculptures in this temple, the statues, as I have before remarked, being ranged according to the art of nationality they represented: the Egyptians by themselves, the Assyr- ian in like manner, and the Greek and Roman near the western wall."85 Such approaches were solidified by the multivolume publication of the Swedish Cyprus Expedition, in particular the volume on the Geometric through Classical periods.86 Gjerstad emphasized the artistic effects of foreign political control of the island at various times in the Archaic and Classical periods and viewed indigenous Cypriote art as a template at the disposal of influences from successive genera- tions of foreign potentates and artisans. The result- ing system of classification betrays this method and, especially with reference to the Archaic and Classical periods, reveals his theoretical stance on the develop- ment and dating of Cypriote sculpture in light of the multicultural aspects of its tradition. As early as 1974, Vermeule noted the influence of Cesnola's interpre- tation and criticized the reliance on foreign costume and headgear for chronology, arguing that ethnic differentiation in dress did not necessarily equate with periods of foreign domination over the island.87 Markoe reiterated a similar idea in his study of the Phoenician-borrowed Egyptianizing dress of some statues, interpreting them as suitable costumes cho- sen for the dedications of local "Cypro-Phoenicians" of the late sixth and early fifth centuries B.C.E. (and thus not necessarily associated with Egyptian politi- cal control over the island, as was often assumed) ,88 In fact, many other important contributions to the history of Cypriote sculpture have emphasized its dis- tinct character and the diverse streams of influence that are reflected in the sculpted votive tradition of the island's sanctuaries.89 Nevertheless, manifestations of culture contact in Cyprus (e.g., iconography, language, ritual behavior) are still understood and discussed primarily with refer- ence to external sources and rarely in terms of their subsequent translation in a Cypriote context. This is es- pecially true in the case of divine images. Iconograph- ic studies continue to identify and trace the varying traditions witnessed in divine images; consequently, the recognition of hybridization processes and novel forms and meanings produced in this context are rarely considered. To return to Nicolaou's picture of an ancient Cyprus engaged in cultural intercourse with a variety of foreign polities, it is not so much the island's partners that we should be interested in but the offspring of these unions. The Master of the Lion in Its Cypriote Context When viewed through the lens of postcolonial the- ory and the subtleties of hybridization, the Master of the Lion emerges as a novel identity navigating the boundaries between cultural communities. The pres- ence of this hybrid form in the archaeological record of multiple Cypriote sanctuaries reflects the predispo- sition of Cypriote artists to appropriate foreign sym- bols into a local religious tradition. In away, the artists themselves helped structure a third space or middle ground of "communication, negotiation and, by impli- cation, translation" in Cypriote religion.90 The success of this image is dependent upon its ability to negotiate 83 Tatton-Brown 1997, 15. A similar narrative is found in the revised edition of Footprints in Cyprus: An Illustrated History (Tatton-Brown 1990, 66-71), which represents the most re- cent comprehensive survey of the island from prehistory to the modern period. 84 Reyes (1994, 3-5) has questioned the extent to which the archaeological record of Cyprus provides direct evidence for periods of foreign domination. His call for less emphasis on supposed disruptions and dominations by foreign powers has been influential. See Karageorghis (2002, 151-53 [Assyr- ian] , 195-97 [Egyptian] ) on supposed Assyrian and Egyptian "domination"; see also Sherratt 2003b, 235-37. 85 Cesnola 1878, 159; cf. Lang (1878, 42), who argued that "for a proper comprehension of Cyprian antiquities, we must, however, keep clearly in view the principal epochs into which the early history of the island may be divided." Lang's col- league Poole, who contributed an essay titled "Observations on the Above Excavations" (Lang 1878, 54-63), applies this approach to the stylistic divisions of the statuary, suggesting as many as eight categories: Assyrio-Persian, Egyptian, Cypri- ote, Archaic Greek, Pelasgic, Barbarous Asiatic, Greek, and Hieratic (the last subdivided into Assyrio-Persian and Egyptian). 86 Gjerstad et al. 1934-1972, 4:449-78. 87Vermeule 1974, 287-88. 88 Markoe 1990, 120. 89E.g., Gaber-Saletan 1986, 78-85; Childs 1994, 116. 90Gandhi 1998, 131.</page><page sequence="17">2008] REPRESENTATION AND HYBRIDITY IN CYPRIOTE SANCTUARIES 19 meaning in the context of a Cypriote sanctuary and its patrons, regardless of any original significance. Even the simple shift in nomenclature, away from cultur- ally specific theonyms such as Herakles, Melqart, or Apollo to the more generic Master of the Lion, iso- lates the most significant aspect of this iconography: the mastery over animals. In general, the aggressive stance, club, lion skin, and lion can all be read as em- bodying the power of the divinity.91 The skin, worn as both headdress and cape, serves as a trophy and as a symbolic device through which the god assumes the guise and characteristics of the lion; more explicitly, the miniature lion grasped in the left hand and held tight against the leg symbolizes the god's strength and skill in combat. The mastery over lions in the form of the skin, as well as the dominance signified by the small lion, provide evidence of divine control over ani- mals and nature itself. The image thus carries with it a message of sustained power over external forces, rein- forcing his role as both a guardian and a guarantor of prosperity in the face of an unknown future. The pres- ence of this image in sanctuaries dedicated to the cult of a male divinity and predominantly located around the agricultural plains of the Mesaoria (places where agricultural production and animal husbandry were tied directly to the fortunes of nature) suggests that it must have embodied the necessary aspects of power, protection, and prosperity - focal points in the recipro- cal relationship inherent in votive religion. As a visual embodiment of potency, the Master of the Lion could claim authority over a wide range of divine spheres: virility in combat, fertility and economic productivity, or divine custodial protection (such as in the realm of domestication and other pastoral activities). Conse- quently, this collective, hybridized iconography served the needs of local Cypriote communities (whether identified as Greek, Phoenician, or Eteocypriote) , who embraced the deity without needing to reference ex- ternal cultural contexts or meanings. This reassessment of the Master of the Lion, which disregards foreign contexts for theonyms and meaning, situates him more confidently within a broader ideo- logical trend in Cypriote cult typified by the popularity of the Master of Animals in Cypriote religious iconog- raphy during the first millennium B.C.E.92 As we have seen, the Master of Animals motif has a long-standing tradition in the Mediterranean, and in Cyprus, this divine concept traces its roots back at least to the Late Bronze Age. Furthermore, the related imagery of a god assuming the characteristics of animals through zoomorphic traits is equally present in earlier Cypri- ote traditions, exemplified by the two bronze warrior gods from Enkomi wearing animal-horned helmets, in addition to examples found in other media.93 An important series of Archaic and Classical terracotta and limestone sculptures that feature priests (?) wear- ing animal masks (primarily bulls but at least one lion) discovered across the island suggests that the concept lingered as part of ritual practice well into the first millennium B.C.E. , when the statues of the Master of the Lion became popular offerings.94 The discovery of worked bull crania in Bronze Age and later levels at Enkomi and Kition reveals that theriomorphic ritual was indeed part of Cypriote religious rites and did not just reside in the imagination of the terracotta and limestone sculptors.95 Significantly, the trappings of the Master of Animals occupy a central place in the divine iconography of urban and extra-urban sanctuaries in central Cyprus throughout the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic pe- riods (table I).96 In addition to the images of the Mas- ter of the Lion, this region witnessed the introduction of two other related male types: (1) a figure, most of- ten seated, wearing a ram-horned headdress and skin (Master of the Ram; fig. 10); and (2) a figure, most often standing, accessorized with the ears and horns of a goat and wearing a goat skin (Master of the Goat; fig. II).97 Both represent hybridized forms created for 91Yon 1986b; Hermaiy 1989, 299; Karageorghis 1998, 70; Counts 2004, 180-83. 92 Counts 2004. 93 Karageorghis 2002, 95-104, figs. 192, 196. More explicit references to the Master of Animals are found on Late Bronze Age seals and other objects from Cyprus that depict a hero or deity battling animals (Webb 1999, 263-66). 94 For masked figures in Cypriote limestone and terracotta sculpture, see Karageorghis 1971; 2000, 147; Hermary 1979, 2001.

Karageorghis (2002, 148) suggests that the practice of wearing masks continued from the Bronze Affe to the Archaic period. 96 Counts 2004; Counts and Toumazou 2006. 97 The Master of the Ram, which is often referred to as "Zeus Ammon" or "Baal Hammon," is the focus of Buchholz 1991; Hermary 1992b; Counts (forthcoming) ; see also Sophocleous 1985, 58-69; Karageorghis 1988; Fourrier 2001, 45.

The Master of the Ram type, which appears in the second half of the sixth century B.C.E. and enjoys some popularity well into the fourth century, is found in contexts contem- porary with those of the Master of the Lion in Cypriote sanctuaries.98 The earliest examples show an enthroned human figure with the head of a ram in the manner of the Egyptian god Amun; the next generation features a fully human figure wearing the horns of the ram as a headdress - attributes commonly associated with the Graeco-Egyptian Zeus Ammon. At about this same time, the god also began to wear the skin of an animal (maybe a ram) tied at the chest. While the god is as- sociated with the ram through the horns and perhaps the skin, he is often depicted accompanied by one or two rams, or in some instances, reclining on the back 98 Hermary 1989, 305; Counts (forthcoming).</page><page sequence="19">2008] REPRESENTATION AND HYBRIDITY IN CYPRIOTE SANCTUARIES 21 of one in a hierarchical positioning that recalls Near Eastern Master of Animals types (see fig. 8). Images of the Master of the Goat began to appear in the late fourth century B.C.E., at which point they systematically replaced the Master of the Lion and the Master of the Ram types in certain Cypriote sanctuaries." The main type features a human body and face coupled with the horns and ears of a goat. The god also carries pipes and a lagobolon (a device for hunting rabbits). The figure wears only a goat skin tied across the chest in a knot; in almost every case, the god appears ithyphallic. Here we find clear parallels with the iconography of the Greek Pan. Nonetheless, there are significant differences. In Greece, Pan is predominantly shown with the legs and often the head of a goat. Like the Master of the Lion, interpretations of these images have relied heavily on exacting identifications of attributes and associated theonyms (e.g., Zeus Am- mon/Baal Hammon and Pan) and have subsequently failed to provide meaningful reference to broader re- ligious or even sociopolitical contexts in Cyprus. The complex iconography of the Master of the Lion, the Ram, and the Goat types betrays diverse geographical or even cultural origins; still, there is a fundamental similarity in the meaning of the attributes that accom- pany them. Most significantly, these images incorpo- rate certain elements that underscore the god's role as Master of Animals. As opposed to the idea that these three types correspond to different divinities (wheth- er local or foreign), the hybridized images appear to represent a single, principal male divinity - a Master of Animals - with multifarious traits and spheres of divine power that are not necessarily meant to em- body multiple divinities. Each divine type presents an essentially anthropomorphic divinity with distinct zoomorphic traits borrowed from those animals with which the god is commonly associated: the lion, in the form of the skin worn both as a headdress and a cape; the ram, materialized in the horns, as well as the skin tied at the chest; and the goat, manifested in the horns and ears combined with a human head and the goat skin tied in a knot at his chest. Each of the animals, in its own way, personifies the power of nature. Thus, the ability to control them or even assume their basic characteristics signals the power of the divinity. The parallels are drawn even closer when one notes that in many cases, the skins are tied at the chest with the so-called Herakles knot - an attribute with magico- religious significance.100 Fig. 10. Limestone statuette of enthroned Master of the Ram with cornucopia, ht. 19.5 cm. Paris, Musee du Louvre, inv. no. MNB 316 (© Musee du Louvre/Chuzeville). In her important study of the Geometric Greek Mas- ter of Horses, Langdon notes that the range of animals associated with images of the Master of Animals in Aegean contexts marks the multiplicity of the divine figure's character traits: powerful hero, protector of wild nature, and domesticator of beasts.101 Langdon's sensitive reading of divine iconography in a first- millennium B.C.E. Aegean context, characterized by the entanglement of artistic symbols that is eventually manifested through various hybrid forms, provides a useful analogy for the interpretation of divine iconog- raphy in Cyprus. In fact, Sophocleous has argued that the various representations of male gods in Cyprus should be interpreted as the visual manifestations of a "Grand Dieu," who acted as cohort to the island's "Grande Diesse."102 Sophocleous' Great God derives his power through an association with the sky and the control of atmospheric phenomena, thus - by exten- sion - claiming power over "la fecondite congue sous son aspect masculine."103 Hermary, too, has suggested that male divine types found in Archaic-Hellenistic sanctuaries reflect multiple spheres of influence (e.g., "Hermary 1989, 311. 100 Nicfforski 2005. 101 Langdon (1989, 199) emphasizes the divine aspect of the Master of Animals in Aegean Bronze Age art and notes the significance of Cyprus in the transmission of such motifs and functions from east to west. 102 Sophocleous 1985, 26-8, 216-18.

For example, Serwint has deconstructed the pedigree of the Cypriote goddess Aphrodite (in her many and diverse forms) and per- suasively argued that the goddess manifested multiple spheres of influence (e.g., sexuality, fertility, military prowess) into a single deity but with a complex and multifaceted personality.105 In the context of culture contacts and clashes, the emergence of a hybrid Master of Animals in Cypriote cult should come as no surprise. The mixing of existing symbols available to Cypriote sculptors would appear to reflect quite well the processes of acquisition, trans- formation, and translation that characterize ancient contact zones. The notion of mastery over animals - as manifested in the images discussed here - and the attendant jurisdiction over natural forces responded well to the needs of local Cypriote communities. At the same time, the imaging of this deity responds to a spe- cific cultural and physical landscape on Cyprus, espe- cially among the communities within and around the Mesaoria in central Cyprus, where the images are con- centrated (i.e., Tamassos-Frangissa, Idalion, Athienou- Malloura, Golgoi-Ayios Photios, Lefkoniko). Estab- lished in Cyprus' agricultural heartland, many of the sanctuaries dedicated to the Master of Animals were located outside the urban centers of the various city- kingdoms and thus also served a rural population (see fig. 1, table 1). If we examine the distribution of sanctuaries exhibiting the iconography of the Master of Animals, a new picture emerges. While the cluster of sanctuaries remains fixed within its physical land- scape, the consideration of potential political borders reveals that these sanctuaries are scattered across a relatively large area associated with no less than four (and perhaps five) separate kingdoms: Kition, Idalion, Tamassos, Chytroi, and possibly Salamis. Since the physical limits of these individual kingdoms are un- known, those sanctuaries located outside the urban centers should only be associated loosely with any one particular kingdom, although such an association can be assumed for each. Sanctuaries located in or imme- diately adjacent to urban centers, however, provide ample evidence for the presence of this iconography in each of the kingdoms linked to this region. This unity of cult thus appears regardless of any political, linguistic, or even cultural differences that may have been felt among the residents of these independent kingdoms. We need not look far to explain the popu- larity of this divine iconography. The god, as Master of Animals, personified a potent force for ensuring future prosperity in the fields, in the folds, and at home, while also offering protection in the manner of a divine shepherd. While previous scholarship has tended to highlight the differences among the many divine images dedicated at sanctuaries throughout central Cyprus, striking typological and iconographi- cal parallels suggest that they all hosted the same deity. More importantly, these parallels expose significant 104Hermary 1989, 295. 105 Serwint 2002, 343-44.

It was through the processes of hybridization that cultural and social boundaries began to blur. As van Dommelen has noted in his discussion of Demeter cults in Punic Sardinia, the significance of recognizing hybridization processes in ancient cultur- al contexts lies more in the potential to expose local practice and meanings than in the recognition of the process itself.106 The potential for cult to facilitate cul- tural exchange on a local level has been highlighted by Malkin in his recent study of Herakles and Melqart in the western Mediterranean.107 According to Malkin, mythical traditions and the "filters of perception" that surround them enabled Greeks, Phoenicians, and in- digenous populations to negotiate a variety of contact situations ranging from peaceful coexistence to appro- priation and colonization.108 It is tempting to suggest that the relative ambiguity of hybridized, iconographi- cal traits enabled the Master of Animals to mediate the boundaries of existing cultural differences within the context of Cypriote votive religion. The power of the Master of Animals in his ability both to control and, if necessary, conquer natural forces would cer- tainly have appealed to farmers, shepherds, soldiers, and merchants alike. The entanglement of varying iconographical traditions in the midst of cultural dif- ference perhaps solidified this religious koine in the Cypriote Mesaoria and provided a visual counterpart to the combined needs of local worshipers. The pref- erence for this deity and the divine spheres of power, protection, and prosperity he embodied represented the collective goals of ancient Cypriotes, regardless of their particular cultural roots or social status. THE MASTER OF THE LION: HYBRIDITY, REPRESEN- TATION, AND THE REFLEXIVITY OF CULTURE Having removed the baggage of culturally defined labels from the Master of the Lion, we are now able to see more clearly the open-ended movement of culture. As quickly as the Master of the Lion was settled into the sacred landscape of Cyprus, he reentered the third space of Mediterranean interactions and emerged re- constituted and redefined, translated into new cultural contexts such as the Phoenician sanctuary of Amrit (an- cient Marathus) on the Levantine coast. Here, a cache of Cypriote sculptures, including many in the guise of the Master of the Lion, were dedicated during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E.109 The material, form, and iconography of these statues can all be traced back to Cyprus. Thus, we see the nuanced relation between cultural signs and artistic practice; the presence of the Master of the Lion at Amrit reveals a Cypriote hybrid born from the intercourse of (at least) two hybrid cul- tures (Greek and Phoenician) and reborn again on the Levantine coast. This movement of culture illustrates what Kurke and Dougherty have called the reflexivity of cultural exchange, where "elements absorbed into another culture and transformed within it may then also affect their function or configuration within the original culture in an ongoing and reciprocal negotia- tion."110 In this case, Near Eastern elements that had been absorbed and transformed in a Cypriote religious context have returned to their source - fully reconfig- ured - in order to communicate a new identity and navigate new cultural boundaries.
