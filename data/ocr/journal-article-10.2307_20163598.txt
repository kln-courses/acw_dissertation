<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Chorus and the Gods in Oedipus Tyrannus CHARLES SEGAL A JLlJLTHOUGH the odes of tragedy are modelled upon traditional choral songs like paeans, epinicians, dithyrambs, and so on, they are not independent ritual acts. They are fictitious ritu als for mythical characters, and they are performed not by citizen worshipers before the altar of a god but by masked performers who act out a mythical narrative. A paean sung within the Oedi pus Tyrannus inside the theater of Dionysus by masked choreutae is not the same as a paean sung in a sanctuary of Apollo at Thebes to avert disaster from the city. Because of this distance from an actual ritual, the dramatist can use ritual forms with greater free dom and even reflect on the nature of ritual.1 Hence at the end of the second stasimon of the Tyrannus the chorus can raise the ques tion of its ritual performance of the ode: tl ?e? \iz xoqeveiv.2 Unlike a chorus that is actually part of a performed ritual in non-mythic space, the content of a tragic chorus's song is often a hypothesis about meaning rather than a final assertion of the play's meaning. It can be regarded as a kind of thought-experi ment, exploring and trying to understand the meaning of other wise unintelligible suffering. We the audience have to judge the chorus's pronouncement as one among several hypotheses about meaning that the play presents. As we shall see in the case of the third stasimon of the Tyrannus, the poet can even raise questions about the authority of the chorus as an interpreter of the gods. The tragedian's "I," unlike the "I" of the choral or epic poet, is absent from the voices that speak about these events or enunciate these hypotheses. He does not have to choose among them, nor does he have to solve all the questions that he raises. The Sophoclean chorus, then, can have a coherent dramatic role as an actor and at the same time seem to say or intuit more than it can always know as a participating character. It can introduce a perspective that reaches beyond the immediate context of the ode and even beyond what the chorus, as a human participant and character, can fully know. At such times the ode creates a larger</page><page sequence="2">Charles Segal 21 frame for the particular purposes of the protagonists or the strug gles between the main actors, a frame that looks beyond the limits of the specific time and place. This aspect of the choral ode belongs to what we may loosely call the religious or theological dimension of Greek tragedy, its concern with exploring the mean ing of human existence in a cosmic perspective. It is also rein forced by the accumulation of themes and images that build up in the language of the play and are often drawn together in suggestive paradigmatic relationships in the odes. This relation between the choral odes and the action is especially important for the figure of Zeus in the Tyrannus and for the meaning of the gods in the play in general. The principal supernatural agent in the Tyrannus is obviously Apollo. The play consistently associates him with the oracles, their ambiguous language, and their uncanny fulfilment. Yet a priest of Zeus (and not, as one might expect, of Apollo) is Oedi pus' principal interlocutor in the prologue (18). With one excep tion?and it is a significant exception?Zeus is mentioned or addressed in every ode in the play.3 The oracular voice at Delphi at the opening of the parodos belongs to Zeus (co Ai?? ??uejr?? (?)?ti, 151). The chorus contin ues in the antistrophe with a prayer to Athena as Zeus' daughter (157-58); and it closes the second antistrophe with an echo of this prayer, in ring form, again addressing Athena as "golden daughter of Zeus" (186-88).4 The chorus then prays to Zeus directly, near the end of the ode, as the ruler of the blazing lightning bolts, ask ing that he destroy the plague-bringer, Ares (200-2) : T?V, 5) TCXV JTUQcJxSqC?V aoTQCui?v hoctct] v?ficav, co Zev JtcxxeQ, vno ocp (J)9l?ov xerjcxnvcp. Echoing the priest's mention of a "fire-bringing god" who sends the plague (27), the chorus draws on an underlying notion of homeopathic magic, Zeus' lightning-fires against the "fires" of fever and disease (cf. also 166,176). The first stasimon, although devoted primarily to Apollo and Delphi, harks back to Zeus' fire-power in the heavens (201), for it calls Apollo "the offspring of Zeus" who "leaps upon [Laius' killer] with fire and lightnings" (469-70):</page><page sequence="3">22 THE CHORUS AND THE GODS IN OEDIPUS TYRANNUS evojrlo? y?o ?ji' a?x?v ?jievOocooxei jtuqi xai oxeoojra?? ? A?o? Yev?ta? For upon him the son of Zeus leaps armed with fire and lightnings . . . This ode's last antistrophe then combines Zeus and Apollo as the joint source of all foreknowledge of human affairs (497-501): ?M,' ? [lev ouv Ze?? ? x' ?jtoXXcov c]uv8xol xai x? ?ooxcov ei?oxe?. ?v??cov ?' ?xt [lavxi? jrA?ovfi, 'yco (Jr?oexai, XQLOL? OUX 8?XLV ?X.T]0r|?. Both Zeus and Apollo have understanding and know the ways of mortals. But that the prophet carries off the prize (of truth) more than I, there is no true judgment. These associations of Zeus with remote power and foreknowledge of a design in human life prepare us for the critical point when Jocasta mentions the triple road and answers Oedipus' frightened questions about Laius' death. He cries out suddenly, "O Zeus, what have you planned to do with me?" (co Zev, xi \iov ?paocxi ?e?ouXeu?cu Ji?oi; 738). This is the only direct address to Zeus outside of a choral ode and the only mention of Zeus in dialogue (with the minor exception of the explanatory "priest of Zeus" in the prologue). It marks a turning point in the mood and action of the play. Instead of being confidently in control, Oedipus begins to suspect the workings of a mysterious divine power behind his life. That loss of control is also indicated in the change in the use of ?ouXeueiv. In the previous scene the verb referred to Oedipus' ability to detect conspiracy and so formed part of the motif of his keen intelligence and his pride in quick, sagacious, and effective action (cf. 536-37, 557, 606, 618, 701). In his outcry of 738 the "planning" belongs to Zeus and it refers to a god's inscrutable will that a mortal begins to question with fear and anguish. A human ruler's perspicacious detection of mortal "planning" thus changes to a frightened recognition of "planning" by a higher power. Sophocles here draws upon the ancient conception of Zeus as the god who controls human destinies, but the second stasimon</page><page sequence="4">Charles Segal 23 develops this view of Zeus in a peculiarly Sophoclean vein.5 It begins with the chorus's prayer for purity in word and deed of which the "lofty-footed gods" in the heavens are the guardians, and moves to a prayer to Zeus as "ruler of all things" near its close (863-72, 904-5). For the first time, the chorus explicitly connects Zeus with a universal moral order. I give a translation of the first strophic system. May it be my portion to bear revered purity of all words and deeds for which are established the high-footed laws, begot ten in the heavenly aether, of which Olympus alone is the father, and no mortal nature gave them birth, nor will obliv ion ever put them to sleep. Great is the god in these, nor does he grow old. Hybris begets the tyrant. Hybris, if it is filled to wanton excess with many things which are not timely nor of advan tage, mounting up to the topmost battlements plunges into steep constraint, where it uses not its foot in usefulness. But the wrestling effort that is good for the city, this I ask the god never to let go. Never will I cease holding god as my protector. The second stasimon of Antigone helps clarify the relation between eternal divinity and Zeus.6 Praising the power of Zeus that is beyond all human overreaching, the chorus emphasizes the god's timeless rule, free of the mortal need of sleep or rest, ageless in its possession of radiant Olympus (Ant. 604-10): xetxv, Zev, ?vvaow xi? ?v ??cov imep?a?ia xax?axoi; x?v oi30' xSjivo? aipe? jroO' ? jiavxoyr|Qco? oux' ax?fiaxot Oecov UTjve?, ?yriQco? ??

What overweening transgression of men could check your power, O Zeus, which neither sleep can seize that seizes all things, nor the tireless months of the gods; but, as a ruler age less in time, you hold Olympus' glitter of radiance.</page><page sequence="5">24 THE CHORUS AND THE GODS IN OEDIPUS TYRANNUS The eternity of Zeus' power contrasts with the suffering mortal generations in the house of Labdacus, characterized by age, decay, and birth, in the preceding antistrophe {Ant. 594-97) : ?pxa?a x? Aa?oaxioav o?xcov ?qcouxxi jrrpaxa c()0ixcov em Jtr|u.aai jr?jrxovx', o?)o' ajraXX?aoei yevecxv y?vo?, akh' eoe?jtei 0ecov xi?, o?&gt;o' exet X.UOLV. I see the ancient woes of the house of the Labdacids, woes falling on woes, nor does generation lighten the succeeding generation, but some god strikes it down, nor does it have relief. This ode's address to Zeus as the eternal ruler of Olympus is fol lowed by a nomos governing human life throughout time {Ant. 611-14): x? x' EJteixa xai xo \ieXkov xai xo jiq?v ejtaox?aet vou.o? o?(e)... Then and in the future and in time before this law will pre vail, nothing great comes into human life without disaster... The Tyrannus* second stasimon has a remarkably similar con figuration of themes and language, although they are disposed in a slightly different order (865-72). The "high-footed laws born in the heavenly aether" introduce a series of polar expressions con trasting mortal generation and its suffering with divinity and eter nity. In the case of the Tyrannus, however, the contrasts are even sharper because these pure, eternal laws in the heavens set off the tangle of incestuous birth and paternity in the house of Oedipus. Zeus' children in the two previous odes, we may recall, are the "sweet-speaking voice" of the oracle, "golden Athena," and Apollo with his fiery, celestial weapons {156-57,186-87,469-70). Oedipus' children stand at the opposite degree of purity. Laws that are hypsipodes surely make us think of Oedi-pous. These laws' metaphorical "birth" in the heavens (o?oav?a 'v/at0?oi X8XVCO08VXE?, 866-67) reminds us of pollutions attending the lit eral "births" in the house of Oedipus, conveyed by the recurrence</page><page sequence="6">Charles Segal 25 of the root xex- throughout the play 7 When all-seeing Time, in the fourth stasimon, reveals the truth, it shows Oedipus in an incestu ous marriage, xexvouvxa xai xexvo?^evov (1215-6). To return to the second stasimon, these celestially born laws are explicitly contrasted with "birth" among the "mortal race of men" {ovb? viv/0vax? fyvoi? ?v?ocov/?xixxev, 868-70) and implicitly contrasted with the disordered city's "begetting" of the tyrant at the beginning of the antistrophe (u?tuc fyvxevei x?oavvov, 873). The relevance to the human world of the play is left vague; but, as the "unwritten laws" that prohibit violations like incest and parri cide, these celestial ordinances are at the opposite extreme from the pollutions that surround Oedipus.8 Hence the language of purity here, especially in the chorus's opening prayer for euoejtxov ayveiav ^oycov/Epycov xe Ji?vxcov ("revered purity of words and deeds," 864?65), sets the life-situation of Oedipus into the largest possible framework of both time and space, that is, eternity on the one hand and the heavens on the other. The contrast with Oedipus is even stronger because of his own outcries about "purity" when Jocasta's narrative elicits his disturbed account of his oracle about incest and parricide (at/ oi&gt;xi Jtcx? ?vayvo?; 823; co 0ecov ?yv?v oe?ac,830).9 We need not assume that the ode is explicitly accusing Oedipus of characteristically "tyrannical" crimes;10 rather, it states a condi tion of mortality, a contingent possibility of human life, that will prove to be true for Oedipus even though he may be legally inno cent. This possibility in fact touches one of the essentially tragic elements in the situation of Oedipus, namely that it is possible to violate these remote laws in the aether and still be innocent of crime as defined by man-made laws before a human court. Oedi pus comes to exemplify that gulf between human physis, in both its physical and moral makeup, and the purity of the divine order. These celestial laws have been created by a "father" who stands apart from mortal generation, whereas for the central figures of this play the Ovax? (|)i)oi? (869), which includes the root sense of generational origins in physis, means terrible suffering. In this mortal world Teiresias stands apart as the one man who has truth by inborn nature ((p/xcxXrjG?? ?ujt?(|yux?v avBoc?jtcov u?vcp, 298 99).ll But for Oedipus the acquisition of truth comes only from painful struggle; what he was "born with" pulls him into delusion, blindness, and fearful impurity, as we see in the play on the root 4&gt;u- at the cry of recognition (1183-4): co,... ooxi?

I whom am revealed as born from those from whom I should not be born ...") and the chorus's cry afterwards, icb ysveai ?goxcov ("O generations of mortals," 1186). The third stasimon repeats many of the motifs of the second: Olympus (1088), the heavens (1090), and the relation between men and gods (1086-109) :12 If I am a prophet and endowed with knowledge in my mind, O Cithaeron, I swear by Olympus, on tomorrow's full moon you will not fail to know that we increase you in honor as Oedipus' fellow-countryman and nurse and mother, and that you will be celebrated by us in the dance, as bearing aid to my ruler. O Phoebus, may these things be pleasing to you. Which one, which of the long-lived nymphs bore you as child, drawing near mountain-treading Pan as father, or was it some bride of Loxias Apollo who bore you? For to him are dear the upland plains that give pasture in the wild. Or did Hermes who rules Cyllene or the Bacchic god who dwells on the tops of mountains receive you, a find of joy, from one of the Heli conian nymphs with whom he most joins in play? These motifs, however, have a significance almost exactly the opposite of the previous ode. Carried away momentarily by Oedi pus' impulsive optimism, the chorus reverses its previous vision of austere Olympian divinities.13 The gods of this ode, far from being aloof in the celestial aether, frolic with nymphs in all-too-human erotic "play" (onujiai?ei, 1109). "Olympus" here (1088) recalls "Olympus, only father" of the aether-born laws in the second stas imon (867-68). The third stasimon, however, makes no reference to Zeus, and this is his only absence from a choral ode in the play. Sophocles' Zeus has no place among these playful, all-too-human Homeric gods to whom the chorus, with premature joy and levity, traces Oedipus' origin. Although the chorus swears by Olympus, the content of their oath is far removed from that of the "only father, Olympus" and his laws in the second stasimon. It points not to timeless moral principles but implicitly to the changes of the day (x?v auQiov Jiavo?Xjvvov) and the mortal processes of generation and nur ture (xai xqo(|)?v xai u.ax?o' ai^etv, 1089-91).14 These signs of</page><page sequence="8">Charles Segal 27 mortality and human temporality, far from bringing help to the xuQavvo?, as the chorus optimistically assumes (cb? ?JT?r)Qa c()?Qovxa/xot? ejxo?? xnrjavvoi?, 1094-5), will in fact soon fulfil the warnings about the xuQavvo? in the previous ode. The chorus is sympathetically caught up in Oedipus' errors about his birth, and about birth generally; and their theology at this point partakes of both their mood and their blindness. Instead of being completely set apart from mortal generation, these gods are very much involved in the cycle of procreation and birth. Olympus, the previous ode's father of remote laws, is here the term in an oath, full of presumptuous error, about Oedipus' birth in the Theban land (1088). Instead of an ageless 9eo? (872) among his timeless laws on high, these are specific, named divinities. The full irony of this ode emerges only when we appreciate the contrasts with the previous ode.15 The collocation vouxh ?ipijto?e? in the second stasimon, for example, is both morpholog ically and semantically inverted in this ode's Jt?xixE? aypovouxH (1102), the upland "plateaux that afford pasture in the wild." From a celestial zone of nomoi beyond mortal generation we descend to earth-bound nomoi (agro-nomoi) as the pasturage of animals, in the mountainous places where an anthropomorphic Apollo has his love-games with nymphs. The gods now move out of the realm of the timeless, for these nymphs, though "long-lived" (1099), are not immortal.16 "Birth" is here entirely mortal and lit eral (x?xvov ... 8XIXX8,1098), in contrast to the figurative "birth" of the celestial laws (xexvcoO?vxe?, 867) and their separation from mortal generation (869-70).17 For once in the play, prophecy seems to have happy overtones as the chorus boldly takes on the role of mantis (1086). Indeed, their opening words in the ode, etJieg ?ycb uxxvxi? elfii xai xax? yvc?u-av ??Qi?, echo their words in the first stasimon, where they attribute such knowledge to the gods Zeus and Apollo; however, even in voicing their doubts about Teiresias' knowedge of the divine in his accusations of Oedipus, they at least demur at how to distinguish a true from a false prophet (499-501). But here in the third stasi mon they confidently assume mantic authority, allowing only the very mild qualification of etJtEQ. Their claim to mantic truth is all the more disturbing because they ended their previous ode, the sec ond stasimon, by making the gods' oracles the touchstone of the validity of religious practices, including their own choral dances</page><page sequence="9">28 THE CHORUS AND THE GODS IN OEDIPUS TYRANNUS (895-96, 906-10). Claiming to speak as a mantis, the chorus is totally mistaken, both about the gods and about men. This claim to mantic truth has still a further layer of irony, and one which partially accounts for the contorted syntax of their opening lines, their oath about Oedipus' divine origin. The con torted expression, with its double negatives ("You will not be kept unknowing that we will not fail to honor you ... ,"1089-95) con tinues to perplex commentators.18 The difficult style suggests oracular speech. The chorus is speaking both as an oracle and as an interpreter of oracles, a mantis. They thus appropriate the voice both of the god and his prophet, but they are wrong on both sides of the speech act. What they say about the gods has already been disproven by the previous ode; and what they say about Oedipus' origins has, at this point in the play, already been disproven by Jocasta's fatal recognition of the truth less than twenty lines before (1056-72). The chorus's qualifications as a mantis are thus completely discredited. We now see in retrospect, as they do not yet, that their judgment of Teiresias' ability as mantis in the first stasimon was mistaken (499-511). He, not the chorus, is the true mantis. The chorus's simplistic, premature, and sensual image of divin ity at the end of the ode parallels their erroneous appeal to proph ecy at the ode's beginning. This down-to-earth view of the gods inspires the ode with a confident joy in "dances" on the mountain (xai xooe?eaOai Jtgo? f|- / u.cov cb? ?jtirjQa ()&gt;?Qovxa / xo?? eu.o?? xuqovvoi?, 1092-5), whereas the more serious contemplation of man-god relations in the previous ode leaves the chorus in ago nized self-questioning about the performance of its choral ritual (xi ?el \ie XOQ8U8LV, 896), especially in light of their present per plexity about the gods' justice and their prophecies (el y?g ai Toiai?e jro??;Eic x?uiai..., 895-98; eqqei x? 0Eta, 910). The ironies in this ode are revealing for the problematical nature of authority and knowlege in the tragic chorus. Whereas the lyric poet has numerous strategies to assert and maintain the authority of his choral persona, the tragic poet makes that authority itself an issue in the drama. So here, in the third stasimon, he undermines the chorus's authority, at least momentarily, through its display of its ignorance about the gods and through its gross failure in attempting to appropriate mantic knowledge. In the fourth stasimon, however, the chorus, returning to surer ground, namely the familiar tragic theme of mortal limitations,</page><page sequence="10">Charles Segal 29 regains some of its authority. This ode, which comes directly after Oedipus' recognition of the truth, fulfils the second's dark vision of human generation and thus cancels out the third's foolish opti mism. The opening cry, lob yEVEai ?poxcov (1186), takes up the theme of mortal "generation" in Ovax? (|yuai? ?v?ocov (869). Of this physis and its sufferings Oedipus is now the paradigm (1193), immersed in the pollutions of incestuous generation. Fatherhood, in the second strophe, is now neither the metaphorical paternity of Olympus' eternal laws nor the carefree result of divine amours but rather a tie fraught with violence, curse, and pollution in the nar row, earth-bound mortal limits of bedchamber and "furrow" (jtat?i xai jtaxQi/OaXafATiJioA-cp jteoelv,/. . . ai JiaxQcp-/a? a' ?XoxE? (|)?qeiv ..., 1209-12). Zeus' presence, understated though it is, forms a thread linking all the odes. In the parode and first stasimon his power seems scarcely distinguishable from Apollo's. He is closely associated with the oracle, either directly (151,157-58, 496-97) or indirectly as the father of Apollo (0 A?o? yev?xa?, 470). Indeed, in this last passage Zeus' attributes of celestial fire and lightning, enumerated in the previous ode (200-1), are now assigned to Apollo (EJiEvOQcpoxEi/jruQi xai OTEQOJtat? ? At?? yev?xa?,, 469-70). In the second stasimon, however, Zeus comes into his own, as it were: he becomes the embodiment of an eternal order and of moral laws located in the remote heavens. Oedipus, as I noted above, has a dim and frightened intimation of this aspect of Zeus in his cry of 738, "O Zeus, what have you planned to do with me"; but this intimation, as always in Sophocles, remains elusive and mysterious for mortals. It emerges only in the imagistic and allusive language of the odes that follow. The attributes of Zeus' order are not only absolute power (jtcxvx' av?oocov, 904), but also eternity, purity, and celestial remoteness (863ff.)?that is, qualities that are the exact opposite of the mortal protagonist. They do not necessarily constitute a comforting vision; divinity and eternity seldom do in tragedy. The third stasimon indicates that the chorus can be mistaken in their view of what the gods are like. Even within the second stasimon, the vision of celestial laws shifts to doubts about x? 0??a, beliefs and practices involving the gods in the mortal world as manifested in the truth of oracles. Soon afterwards Jocasta seems to com pound the doubts and anxieties of the chorus, evoking a world order governed by chance, where mortals must "live at random,</page><page sequence="11">30 THE CHORUS AND THE GODS IN OEDIPUS TYRANNUS however one can" (977-79). In her growing desperation this vision of chaos is an argument against fear (t? ?' ?v (j&gt;o?oiT' avOocoJioc .. .,"What would a person fear," 977). Yet the chorus's fears develop precisely against their vision of a universe that is not random or chaotic (in contrast to Jocasta's speech of 977-83), and against their sense of divine purity and of laws that outlast ephem eral human lifetimes. But these aether-generated laws, however broad a perspective they create for the human suffering in the play, do not really explain that suffering.19 Perhaps the best that such a vision of remote, eternal laws can do is to provide an implicit defi nition of tragic mortality through the contrast with its opposite. If we look from overall meaning to character, the relation between the odes seems to plot a development of the chorus as a participating character. The odes move from anxiety about the city and the plague in the parode to concern for Oedipus in the first stasimon, and then, at a moment of crisis, to warnings about the dangers of power and the presence of remote gods and their laws in the second. The chorus is carried along with Oedipus in opti mism and hope in the third stasimon, with its image of playful divinities on the mountain and an easy, physical communication between men and gods. But with the spectacle of Oedipus' suffer ing before them they retreat to a sharper division between divinity and mortality, between the eternal "all-seeing time" and the confu sion of pollutions of mortal time and birth (1213-22). In the movement from the second to the third stasimon, the mood of fear about the gods and the worry over the city swing irrationally to relief and joy in playful, amorous gods and to a focus on the life of a single individual. The chorus here seems to have lost perspective?we may call it the tragic perspective?that it will regain in the following ode, where mortal generations are as "nothing," and the individual life of Oedipus is no longer a special instance of divine birth but rather a "paradigm" (1193) ofthat ter rible fall from high to low, prosperity to nothingness (1186-8) that was the subject of the anxious mood of the preceding ode (cf. 1197-206 and 873-82). It is, of course, tempting to identify the second stasimon's vision with Sophocles' own, for it is the grandest, most abstract, and most philosophical view of divinity enunciated in the play.20 But a tragic chorus also has a place within an unfolding dramatic ac tion. That action will come to include Oedipus' discovery of a new kind of human strength, a strength in which he can "bear" man's</page><page sequence="12">Charles Segal 31 suffering of the woes of life (1415). In this new, human strength he demonstrates too that the blood ties that create his terrible pollu tions also carry with them the bonds of love, pity, and compassion (cf. 1471-5, 1486-514). The remote gods of the second stasimon, with their pure, celestial laws, are of course untouched by such stains of mortal generation; but they seem equally untouched by the human qualities of love and pity that are engendered along with the children.21 NOTES 1.

For a recent survey of the various interpretations of the ode see Jean Bollack, L'Oedipe Roi de Sophocle (Lille 1990), 111:532-39. 11. For the relation between Teiresias and "truth" see Mario Vegetti, "Forme di sapere nell' Edipo Re" in his Tra Edipo e Euclide: Forme del Sapere Antico (Milan 1983), 23-40, especially 31-33. 12. On this ode's echoes of various key terms in the play see David Sansone, "The Third Stasimon of the Oedipus Tyrannos" CP 70 (1975), 112ff. 13. While it is true that this ode is part of "the psychological development of the play," as Bowra suggests (note 8), 199, the psychological interpretation is inade quate. For a criticism of Bowra's psychological approach see Sansone (note 12), 111. Gellie's otherwise sensitive discussion of the play suffers from this tendency to trivialize the ode as an expression of "Oedipus's exhilarated state of mind": George Gellie, Sophocles: A Reading (Melbourne 1972), 98; and he closes this paragraph with the unfortunate generalization, "It is a pretty and a preposterous song, and it achieves its end: it holds up the spirits of the play." See, however, his somewhat fairer appreciation in his general chapter on the chorus, 243-44. Cynthia P. Gardi ner, The Sophoclean Chorus: A Study of Character and Function (Iowa City 1987), 106, accords the ode only a brief paragraph, also oriented toward the psychology of the chorus, their "unusual indulgence in illusion." See also Burton (note 9), 169-70, for whom the chorus is "a projection of the king's mood of exaltation." 14. For the uncertainty of "tomorrow" and mortality see Simonides, frag. 521 PMG. 15. Gellie (note 13), 231, for example, seriously underestimates the thematic con nections when he calls the third stasimon "an irrelevant jig" with which "the chorus manage to put a smile on the face of the play." 16. On the mortal divinity of the nymphs see Wilamowitz-Moellendorff (note 8), 1.184-85, with note 3,185. 17. On the ironical use of teknon in the third stasimon see Sansone (note 12), 115. 18. See the comments ad loc. of Dawe and Kamerbeek. Dawe and Jebb emend the text. Keeping the transmitted text, I understand f\[ia?, as subject, from the fol lowing f|H(bv but, with Kamerbeek, it is equally possible to understand x?v cmoiov jiavo?XTVvov as subject, i.e., "tomorrow's full-moon celebration (at a pannychis) honors you, Cithaeron, as Oedipus' homeland," etc. 19. See Winnington-Ingram (note 3), 321ff., who plausibly suggests that Sopho cles' vision of a remote and inscrutable divine order also includes pity for suffer ing humanity. 20. C. H. Whitman, Sophocles: A Study of Heroic Humanism (Cambridge, Mass. 1951), 133, for example, refers to the second stasimon as "an ode which has been almost universally taken for a pronouncement ex cathedra by the poet him self," and then offers his own critique of that view. 21. An expanded form of this essay appears in my book, Sophocles' Tragic World: Divinity, Nature, Society (Cambridge, Mass. 1995), 180-98.</page></plain_text>
