Your home is Aragon, a land dear to me for its solitude, for the geometry of its roads, for the quiet green of its courtyards hidden behind bellied gratings. There are dark chapels with sorrowful portraits, relics, braids of hair in glass cases, phials of real tears and real blood; and small arenas where there is no escape for the beast and the slender men move with the agile steps of dancers. Your land embodies some quintessential virtue of our peninsula in its lines, its faith, its fury. From these I shall choose a few symbolic images as the heraldic Don Sebastiano de Aviz (1554-1578) was the last Portuguese king of the house of Aviz. He came to the throne while still a child, was raised in an atmosphere of mysticism, and came to believe he had been chosen by God to accomplish great deeds. Nursing his dream to subject all Barbary to his rule and extend his kingdom as far as the revered Palestine, he put together a huge army, made up mostly of adventurers and beggars, and set off on a crusade that was to spell disaster for Portugal. In August of 1578, exhausted by the heat and a forced march across the desert, the Portuguese army was destroyed by the light cavalry of the Moors near Al-Ksar el Kabir. Sebastiano had left no direct descendants; with his death, Portugal was subjected to foreign domination for the first and last time in its history. Annexed to the crown of Spain bv Philip II, it regained its independence in 1640 after a national rebellion. 123</page><page sequence="3">ANTONIO TAB UCCHI emblem of a unique nation that you shall inscribe in the borders of the painting I am hereby commissioning from you. So then: On the right you shall paint the Sacred Heart of Our Lord. It will be dripping and bound in thorns, as in the images sold by peddlers and the blind in the squares in front of our churches. But it must faithfully reproduce man's real anatomy, since to suffer on the cross Our Lord became a man, and his heart burst like a human heart and was pierced like any muscle of flesh. You shall paint it like that, muscular, throbbing, swollen with blood and pain, showing the lacework of the veins, the severed arteries, and the exact lattice of the surrounding membrane open like a curtain and folded back like the peel of a fruit. It would be best to stick the spear that transfixed it into the heart: the blade must be shaped like a hook so as to make a tear from which the blood pours. On the opposite side of the painting, halfway up, and therefore level with the horizon, you shall paint a small bull. Paint him lying on his haunches, his front legs stretched out before him, like a pet dog; his horns must be diabolical and his countenance evil. In the physiognomy of this monster you shall demonstrate the flair for the wondrous, as in Los Caprichos, where you excel. So a sneer shall be crossing the animal's muzzle, but the eyes must be innocent, almost childish. The weather shall be misty; the hour, dusk. The merciful, soft shadow of evening will already be falling, veiling the scene. The ground will be littered with corpses, thousands of corpses, thick as flies. You shall depict them as only you know how, out of place and innocent as the dead are. And beside the corpses, and in their arms, you shall paint the viols and guitars they took with them to their deaths. In the middle of the painting, high up, amidst clouds and sky, you shall paint a ship. Not a ship drawn from life, but something from a dream, an apparition or a chimera. For it must be all the ships that took my people across foreign seas to distant coasts or down to the bottomless depths of the ocean, and also all the dreams my people dreamt looking out over the water from the cliffs of my country, the monsters they conjured in their imaginations, and the fables, the fish, the dazzling birds, the mourning, and the mirages. And at the same time it shall also be my dreams, the dreams I inherited from my ancestors and my 124</page><page sequence="4">PAST COMPOSED own silent folly. The figurehead of this ship shall have a human form and you must paint its features so that they seem alive and distantly recall my own. A smile may hover over them, but it must be faint, or vaguely mysterious: the incurable, subtle nostalgia of one who knows that all is vanity and that the winds which swell the sails of dream are nothing but air, air, air. II Letter from Mademoiselle Lenormand,* fortune-teller, to Dolores Ibarruri, revolutionary M W s y cards portray ladies in sumptuous brocades, coffers, castles, and graceful, dancing skeletons, not at all ma cabre; they are well suited to predict triumph and death to delicate princes and hot-tempered emperors. I do not know why they are asking me to read the story of your life, which has not yet begun and which, given the many years that separate it from this present time, I can see only in broad, perhaps deceptive fragments. Perhaps it is because, despite your humble birth, something in your destiny will share in the nature of monarchs and lords: the profound sadness, like a fatal illness, of those who have the power to decide the fate of others, to dispose of men and women, and to move poor human lives across the chessboard of destiny, even if for a noble end. You will be born in the heart of Spain, in a village whose name is unclear to me, veiled in a black, gritty dust. Your father will plunge into the dark every morning at dawn, reappearing in the dead of night, heavy with filth and fatigue, to sleep like a rock in a bed near your own. Encased in a black dress, your mother will be silent and pious, terrified of what the future may bring. They will call you Dolores, a name suggesting Christian reverence, not realizing that it foreshadows the essence of your life. Your childhood will be utterly empty, I can see that clearly. You will not even wish for a doll: since you have never seen one, *Mademoiselle Lenormand was Napoleon's fortune-teller and one of the most celebrated French clairvoyants of her time. 125</page><page sequence="5">ANTONIO TAB UCCHI you will be unable to dream of it and will only wish vaguely for some anthropomorphic shape to which to transfer your childhood terrors. Your mother, poor ignorant woman, doesn't know how to stitch together a doll, doesn't appreciate that children need games, for what they need most is food. You will grow up with the righteous anger of the poor when they refuse to become resigned. You will speak to those the powerful think of as dirt, and you will teach them not to become like your mother. You will kindle hope in them, and they will follow you. For how could the poor live without hope? You will know the threats of judges, the beatings of the police, the coarseness of prison guards, the contempt of servants. But you will be beautiful, impetuous, fearless, blazing with scorn. They will call you "La Pasionaria," because of the fire that burns in your heart. Then I see war. You will organize your people: on your side will be the lowly and those who believe that men can be redeemed, and that will be your banner. You will fight even ideals similar to yours because you consider them less perfect. And the true enemy, meanwhile, will defeat you. You will know flight, exile, one hiding place after another. You will live on silence and scraps of bread, and at sunset the long straight roads will point to the horizons of lands as alien to you as those you are fleeing. Haylofts and stables, ditches, unknown comrades, the compassion of people-these will shelter you. You are dark-haired and dark-eyed, a woman of the south, accustomed to blond, sun-drenched landscapes dotted here and there with the white of Don Quixote's windmills. You will find refuge in the eastern plains, where the deep winter cold cracks both the ground and people's hearts. You have a resonant Latin accent where the syllables sound like the clapping of hands: a language made for guitars, for festivals in orange groves, for challenges in arenas where brave, stupid men grapple with the beast. The tongue of the steppes will seem barbaric, but you must use it instead of your own. They will give you a medal; every year, at the beginning of May, you will sit on a platform beside taciturn men, also wearing medals, to watch soldiers dressed for the occasion file by below, while the wind spreads the red of the flags and the thundering notes of martial anthems played by 126</page><page sequence="6">PA S T COMP OS ED machines. You will be a veteran with an apartment-a reward for your heroism. War will visit you again. Some are destined to witness destruction and carnage: you are one of them. In a city that will come to be called Stalingrad, death will snatch away the son you bore, the one real solace of your existence. My God, how quickly the years fly by in my cards and in your regrets! Only yesterday he was a child, and today he is already a dead soldier. You will be the heroic mother of a hero; your breast will bear another medal. Now it is after the war in Moscow. I see stealthy footsteps crossing the snow, a pure white blanket that tries in vain to fool my cards. I sense the funereal gloom that pervades the city. At the carriage-stops, everyone stares at the ground to avoid meeting their neighbor's eyes. And you too will be cautious, coming home in the evening, for this is a suspicious time. At night you will wake with a start, soaked in sweat, mistrusting your own loyalty, since the worst heresy is to believe oneself in possession of the truth, and pride has brought down many. You will search your conscience long and critically. And meanwhile, where have your old comrades ended up? Vanished, all of them. You will toss and turn in the bed; the sheets will be briars. Outside it is bitterly cold; how can the pillow burn so fiercely? "All traitors?" "All of them." "Even Francisco, who laughed like a child and sang the romancero?" "Even Francisco." "Even El Campesino, who wept with you over your dead?" Yes, even El Campesino-he's cleaning Moscow's toilets now. And your short sleep will already be over. You are sitting on your bed, staring into the shadows (you always leave a night-light on you can't bear the darkness), eyes fixed on the opposite wall. But what else can you do? South America is too far away, and besides, they won't let La Pasionaria leave the friendly borders of Russia. So you decide it's best to cling to your ideals, make of them an even stronger faith, stronger, and stronger, and stronger still. And after all, time is passing. Slowly, very slowly, but all things do pass. Men pass away, and suffering, and disasters. You too already 127</page><page sequence="7">ANTONIO TAB UCCHI will have almost passed away, and that will be a source of subtle, secret comfort. The meager bun of your hair will turn white with age and grief. Your face will be dry, ascetic, with two hollows. Then your king will die too. You will stay beside the coffin in the middle of the square, day and night, always wholly yourself, silent, unbending, your eyes always open, while a huge crowd files mutely by the embalmed corpse. Priestly, statuesque, carved in stone-"That is La Pasionaria," people will think when they see you, and here and there a father will point you out to his son. And all the while, to keep from giving way to the panic and heartache that have undermined your spirit, the hands in your lap keep twisting and tying your handkerchief into a knot. (How odd: why are your hands stroking that round wad?) And in your mind you see a room that time has carried away: a crude iron bed and a tiny Dolores, frightened and ill, with feverish eyes, calling plaintively, "Mamaita, el jugete . . . Mamaita, por favor, el jugete . . ." And your mother gets up from her chair and makes you a simple doll by knotting the corners of her brown handkerchief. Many more years await you, but they will be all the same. Dolores Ibarruri, when you look into your mirror you will see the image of La Pasionaria, which never changes. Then one day, perhaps, you will read my letter. Or you won't read it, but this will not have the slightest importance, because you will be old and everything will already have been. Because if life could go back and be different from what has been, it would annihilate time and the succession of causes and effects that are life itself, and that would be absurd. And my cards, Dolores, cannot change what, since it has to be, has already been. III Letter from Calypso, a nymph, to Odysseus, King of Ithaca PM urple and swollen like secret flesh are the petals of Ogygia's flowers; brief showers, soft and warm, feed the bright green of her woods; no winter troubles the waters of her streams. 128</page><page sequence="8">PA ST COMPOSED Barely the blink of an eye has passed since your departure, which seems so remote to you, and your voice calling farewell to me from the sea still wounds my divine hearing in this impassable now. Every day I watch the sun's chariot race across the sky and I follow its course toward your west; I look at my unchanging white hands; I trace a mark in the sand with a twig, like a sign of some futile reckoning, and then I erase it. And I have made and erased thousands of marks: the gesture is the same, the sand is the same, I am the same. And everything else. But you, instead, live in change. Your hands have become bony, with protruding knuckles; the firm blue veins that ran across them have come to resemble the knotty rigging of your ship, and if a child plays with them, the blue ropes slither away under the skin and the child laughs and measures the smallness of his own small hand against your palm. Then you lift him from your knees and set him on the ground, because a memory of long ago has captured you and a shadow has crossed your face. But he runs around you shouting happily, and at once you pick him up again and sit him on the table in front of you. Something deep, something that can't be put into words is happening, and you intuitively grasp time's substance in the passing down of the flesh. But what is the substance of time, and where does it form, if everything is fixed, unchanging, one? At night I gaze at the spaces between the stars, I see the boundless void, and what overwhelms you humans and sweeps you away is here only one fixed moment, without beginning or end. Oh, Odysseus, to be able to escape this eternal green! To be able to follow the leaves as they yellow and fall, to live the moment with them! To know that I am mortal! I envy your old age and I long for it; that is the form my love for you takes. And I dream of another Calypso, old and gray and feeble, and I dream of feeling my strength dwindling, of feeling every day a little closer to the Great Circle where everything returns and revolves, of dispersing the atoms that make up this woman's body I call Calypso. And instead I remain here, staring at the sea as it ebbs and flows, feeling like its reflection, suffering this weariness of being that devours me and will never be appeased, and the empty terror of eternity.
