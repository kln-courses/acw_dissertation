Ingres' It has been said that poetry is a picture without form, and painting a poem with form. Kuo Hsi: Essay on Landscape Painting2 In dealing with the question of the relationship of daily life and the value of forms in art, I may be allowed to adjust the phrasing of this problem so as to clarify its meaning for my purpose. To me, it is not so much a question of the forms in which the art of any single culture manifests itself in its urge to give it its own expression, its peculiar character. It is, to me, more the question of the influence on art of the forms of life; those enigmatic, unchanging, and strangely accomplished, unique forms of life, the infinite variety of which is an in- exhaustible source of experience and knowledge. To me, more burning than the elaboration of a modern style in architecture, its influence on the arts and crafts and the cooperation of painting and sculpture in this effort; than the stigma imprinted upon our consciousness by science and technology in the ex- ploration of new analytical forms in art which find their way back again into industrial design, is the question: What has happened to the visual appearances of life in our generation in which the artist refuses to use these eternal forms of Being, these primary manifestations of vision and touch as a direct source of inspiration?3 It seems as if he were afraid of them and by disguising them-as do de Chirico, Lager, Giacometti, and Moore-were making them acceptable, in a metamorphosed form, and only then, to his own inexplicable anxiety. In my youth, during the somewhat disorderly and tumultuous years after the First World War, everyday life-der Alltag-appeared to us young writers and artists in Central Europe as a degradation of life itself. It was a life of the adult, tied up in economic considerations, the life of politicians, generals, and professors, of engineers and bus drivers, of petit bourgeois illusions and the craving for safety, all adding up to a narrow outlook of boredom and banality, with the philistine himself grumbling under its yoke, until finally he and his * This paper, originally entitled "Daily Life and the Values of Forms in Art," was read at the September 20, 1957 session of the Sixth International Congress of Art Criticism in Palermo.

HODIN privilege to grumble were swallowed up by the sound and undiscriminating appetite of the working class. I am inclined to think that every young, creative person, in whatever country and whatever period, even in a peaceful and ac- complished one, must have encountered the same experience. There was Existence, however, true Existence, the eternal manifestation of the mysterious and hidden will which had brought forth the miracle of life, its manifold forms and hieroglyphics. Life was the great enigma, it was love and hate and meditation, it was creation, and only in art were those immortal traces to be found by which man's spirit sought to unravel its riddle through forms and capture its beauty. Art was the dialogue between man and creation; man was a part of it and yet something more: the witness, before man and God, of this great living reality. The artist was a witness, the witness of the glory of Being. The concept of a Godhead who had created it was then still alive. The artist had remained the witness even after the anthropomorphic notion of God had yielded pride of place to another notion: that of life engendering life in an equally miraculous movement of evolution and unfolding-Pasteur's concept of generatio spontanea or aequivoca (Urzeugung). To us, the Darwinian formula did not appeal, nor did that of Einstein. We did not wish to replace the divine by a biological or mathe- matical formula. This was left to the generation following us, a generation which treated all idealistic notions as mere illusions, not as powerful vehicles of the mind and the will which rejected life's own appearances and substituted the wholeness of subject and object by introvert vision alone, elemental shapes by abstract forms, by dynamic multi-enlarged aspects of microscopic data, by diminished cosmic vistas, by air-viewed perspectives of a rather vague though sometimes poetic suggestivity, the introduction of crude "matter" into the picture and the proclamation of its beauty, the relief from inner tension in the artist through the working of pictorial material declared as the primary and main content of art-all this in rebellion against the meaning and the finality of every single spatial form in creation, were it mineral, plant, animal, or as- tronomic. It was Goethe who once said to Boisserde that direct vision of things was everything for him. "The highest of all things would be to understand that all that is concrete is already theory... It is essential not to try and go behind phenomena; they are themselves the doctrine."4 When I first came to Paris as a youth, it embodied for me the great spirit of directness and clarte of the French. There the natural forms themselves were apprehended. They were not just pretexts for the beyond. In other words: one saw. One did not only think specu- latively as was the case East of the Rhine. Now, after so many years, we find ourselves confronted even in Paris, this time with a world in which the primary motive power is not seeing, but knowing and feeling, the behind and the beyond, the vagueness or presumed precision of scientific or philosophic-aesthetic, or psychological, of Germanic or Far Eastern notions. Innocence of vision no longer exists. We are as far away as can be from a classic and mature notion of art. 4 Quoted from J. P. Hodin, "Goethe's Succession," The Dilemma of Being Modern (Lon- don, 1956).</page><page sequence="3">THE TIMELESS AND THE TIMEBOUND IN ART 499 The clearly defined visual concepts have been replaced by concepts reminiscent of Otto Weininger's Henides (Heniden)5-shapeless notions, not yet crystallized, which the young Weininger ascribed mainly to the thought process of women in which a blending of emotion and cognition takes place without the will and the power for formative definition.6 In practically all countries, more than half of the production of the visual arts today is abstract in one form or another. This has never before happened in the history of mankind. It is certain that a comparison between our abstract expression and the emergence of the abstract trend of Neolithic art with its deep symbolic significance will not prevail before a historically well-founded criticism. Our abstract art has a more analytical, apart from its symptomatic, character; only to a very limited degree does it possess that symbol-craving quality of primitive mentality which was dictated by an inner necessity. Fre- quently, however, and to a much larger extent, a similarity with the decorative arts of Islam, a dependence upon mainly primitive sources of art, on the picto- graphic and ideographic stages of writing throughout the world comes to the fore. An abstract artist whose judgment I believe to be honest has repeatedly declared in all seriousness that ninety-nine percent of abstract art today is not art at all but an acquired attitude and a fashion demanding very little true effort and exploiting a trend which offers quick recognition.7 On the other hand, we must not forget that the so-called neo-realist approach in art with all its variations has only produced more or less talented realist mannerisms; it has not brought forth a truly renewed vision of reality. Working with the old formulas of composition and idea content, it has remained academic in its nature. It is a misconception because the artist's reality is a poetic reality, a reality distilled in the process of perceived phenomena wandering through the human mind. It is not the basest, or the saddest, or the most prosaic and naked of all experiences. My statement on the realist movement is meant as a criticism; that on the abstract movement in general and the Tachist movement, Spazialismo, and Action painting in particular, represents criticism only up to a point. The phe- nomenon is too striking, too serious not to involve more than criticism. I am speaking here as a critic, but I have on previous occasions pointed out that true criticism has need of a philosophy if it is to be effective and construc- tive.8 Let me approach the problem of abstraction by way of somewhat geo- metric terms. There is a horizontal line of relationship in the evolution of art,9 5 Henides from ev, because they do not yet indicate any duality or show feeling and sensi- tivity as representing two analytical elements which can be isolated for the purpose of ab- straction. 6 Otto Weininger, Geschlecht und Charakter (Vienna and Leipzig, 1903). 7 Victor Pasmore.

P. HODIN tradition-which in our investigation denotes the fact that any new idea con- stituting the starting point for a next step, a further exploration, a further spe- cialization of its revolutionary content, has its roots in previous developments. That is how analytical Cubism grew out of a Cezanne notion, geometric ab- stract art out of analytical Cubism, and organic abstract art out of a protest against the one-sided geometric concept; how the dynamic art Autre flowed from opposition to a merely static conception, and the expressionist opposed the cerebral notion in geometric abstraction; how the combination of color elements and shapes arose from Impressionist brushwork and Pointillism. The emphasis in painting on action rather than on the result, on the artist rather than the work, is a direct deduction from a former position with its acceptance of the non-art quality of art as stated by Surrealism. Malraux has contended that "the most naive sculptor of the High Middle Ages, like the contemporary painter obsessed with history, when inventing a system of forms, derived it neither from their submission to nature nor from their own feeling but owed it to their con- flict with another art form... That one may become a painter not before the most beautiful woman but before the most beautiful picture."'0 However power- ful, however lasting may be the impressions emanating from the work of art- they always are refractions, reflexions of another spirit, never the direct experi- ence of the phenomena of life themselves, that greatest experience from which alone the formative can grow. I do not suggest that Malraux is unaware of a line of relationship other than the horizontal. He emphasizes, however, and necessarily so for his research, the direction towards the historic, the horizontal line; we must emphasize in our present investigation the direction towards the lost world of visual experience. Is there then yet another line of relationship besides the horizontal line? Yes, most certainly there is, and it is indeed the most important one without which there can be no profound experience at all. To the extent that it is primary it is also subjective-for it is not given to us to recognize the eternal in an objective way.1' It is our contention that there is not and cannot be any true art without the experience of this primary and subjective relationship. We speak of the vertical line of relationship, the relationship between man and creation experi- enced anew in every single individual and every single generation as the irre- placeable happening without which there is no inner life. As a tree grows vertically and cannot exist without its roots, so man's mind cannot work creatively unless his roots reach into the consciousness of Being, unless they are nourished by the springs of the primary and of subjectivism. When in the modern development of art subject matter was dismissed as being literary, what was dismissed, or rather what should have been dismissed was only the traditionalist concept of reality, not the whole form world of phe- nomena. This would seem to us a grave error in logic on the part of a movement which is distinguished by a very logical development. Although subject matter came back into modern art-after analytical Cubism it was Purism, then syn- 10 Andre Malraux, "La Creation Artistique," Les Voix du Silence (Paris, 1951). 11 Eternalize a notion and it becomes stale and sterile.

What a unique experience-this experience of "seeing," for the first time, a flower, a bird, fire, the moon! The sensation, for the first time, of the smell of reseda, of freshly baked bread, and the sound of the sea at night! To feel the gentle softness of a woman's breast, to dip one's hand into the water, for the first time! What is this unknown element of water, cool and evasive, which yields to my hand? The wind plays on its surface, the light penetrates it and changes its color in the depth. H20 is its cerebral aspect. But can it define its appeal to the senses? What is a pear? Its ripe form like the tender shape of a hip, its surface like a look veiled by sorrow, the sweet scent of its flesh, the taste of its juice. Without having experienced it, what can we say? Do you see how far we get with logic alone? Not very far, neither in art nor in philosophy. Mod- ern thought building on logical positivism cannot go a step further than the ironic knowledge of the old Greek Cynics: that a pear is a pear.'2 Tautology, not cognition. It is the senses which are the doors of perception to human and ar- tistic experience. A definition can name a thing, but without life's experience there is no content. The form identifies it. The final shapes of nature so supremely present in the first vision of a child or the primitive artist must have a meaning, a significance, or the life process would not have stopped where it did. To regain this faculty of seeing the appearances of life as though for the first time, this and only this will bring the efforts of modern art to fruition. Again, has not our generation in its continued thrust towards the primary, the elemental, the primitive, committed a similar error in logic when it confused the manner in which children reproduce their vision, with the vision itself? In most cases this has led not to the rediscovery of the virgin vision in all its overpowering intensity but merely to a recapitulation of the child's way of giving it form. From that end we cannot reach it. We cannot become children again and, honestly, we do not want to. We do not want to neglect or diminish that mental process which lies between the primary impression and its mature, formal expression. There are some paintings by Matisse in which every single form is experienced for its own sake; not only as part of a compositional whole but as a manifesta- tion of form per se. By the directness of his intuition the painter has here achieved a visual finality which we could call philosophic. It is as compact as any sentence of the Tao-T&amp;-Ching, as deep and beautiful as a page from the Gilgamesh Epic, as holy as the Song of Bhagavad-Gita.13 Here forms of life are experienced as though seen for the first time. Here, the conceptual organ, the eye, has wrested 12 A. J. Ayer, Language, Truth, and Logic (London, 1936); A. J. Ayer (and others), The Revolution in Philosophy (New York, 1956); G. E.

Here, painting is painting and not science, or logic. Our senses possess a unique faculty and unless we use them primarily, whatever we may achieve in art will be non-art. Only the senses, by restating them, can humanize the forms of life, i.e., unveil their significance through the poetic process of creation and force it out of the anonymity which is the fate of life without witness. In Matisse, to give but one example, modern man reached for the new, which is the eternal. For there is eternity in life; but styles and formulae in art are timebound. In the sequence of time, the timebound, changing quality of art can acquire the inner faculty of a rebirth to life only if in the secret process of crys- tallization it has reached into the timelessness of Being. Why are styles and formulae in art timebound? Because it is the fate of human thought that it is fettered to its own predestined nature. Whatever problems man encounters in his individual life or in the life of his generation, they compel him to embark on their solution, to enable him to survive. That is why Nietzsche conceived of the thinker as searching not for the truth but for the metamorphosis of the world in man.14 That is why we have dark ages and enlightened ages, times when the mind rules and others when the ratio dominates. Rarely times when a balance is achieved between the two. Whenever man tries to break through his own nature in thought, he arrives either at the bleak bones of logical analysis and semantics or at the notions of Platonic ideas, both estranged from life. Art alone can restate the visual essence of life itself. It can-but it does not yet do so in our time, because it is enslaved in the same chains of logic which shackle these particular schools of philosophy. When C6zanne painted apples he perceived them with a struggling and trou- bled mind so as to regain the faculty of seeing; but he rendered them with the help of conventional laws of composition. The next step was taken by Matisse -to the roots, to the source of primary experience. It was not only a logical step in the horizontal direction; it was an essential step in the vertical direction. Every single artist will have to take this step or time will undo his art. Abstraction has become the Alltag-the everyday life of our presence in art. Unless we glorify life's forms in their ultimate significance, unless we reconcile emotionalism and analytical cerebralism in line, color, and handwriting with the finality of life's formative processes, we shall not be able to create an art which is congenial to the wholeness of life. 14 "Der Philosoph sucht nicht die Wahrheit, sondern die Metamorphose der Welt in den Menschen."</page></plain_text>
