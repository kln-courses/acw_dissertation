<plain_text><page sequence="1">"La mort n'en saura rien" exhibition at the Musée des Arts d'Afrique et d' Océanie in Paris: 12 October 1999-24 January 2000. La mort n'en saura rien. Reliques d'Europe et d'Océanie, edited by Yves Le Fur. Exhibition catalogue. 1999. Paris: Edition de la Réunion des Musées Nationaux. 264 pp, photos, biblio. Review by Christian Coiffier Laboratoire d ethnologie du Musée de l'Homme Yves Le Fur showed a great deal of courage and per spicacity in organizing a surprising exhibition, the intention of which was to represent a space of shared spirituality. The exhibition opened in 1999 several days before All Souls' Day, the Christian feast of the dead, and closed on January 24, 2000. Before entering the exhibition the visitor was informed of the special status of the 'works' to be admired. The European and Oceanic relics collect ed for the exhibition are made up of human remains that merit equal respect over and above the out moded ideologies they may now reflect. As soon as the visitor entered the exhibition, he/she was faced with a series of heads from diverse continents (Dayak from Kalimantan for Asia, Munduruku from Brazil and Paracas from Peru for America, Ejagham from Nigeria for Africa, and a dried head from Pontoise in France, representing Europe). These skull/head relics or trophies, treated in dif ferent ways (remodeled, engraved, mummified, deformed) allowed the viewer to form an idea of the universality of ritual practices in the conservation of heads. These five ways of 'sculpturing' the human head or skull attest to man's extraordinary creativi ty in putting on stage one of the most important parts of the human body, the head. The first rotunda, called 'parures du vif, parures d'au-dela,' was devoted to dried heads from Southern New Guinea. The Irian Jaya heads, trimmed with white feathers, their headbands of Coix and Abrus seeds held together by vegetable cords, were placed side by side with heads having long protuberant noses from the Gulf of Papua, and heads with iridescent eyes from the Marquesas Islands. Next to these, three dried heads from Austria and Baveria had harmonious inscriptions painted with floral decorations. The organizer of the exhibition very wisely placed for comparison, in a small display case along one wall, heads from Irian Jaya, New Ireland, and the Admiralty Islands sober ly painted with stripes of red, yellow, and black. The visitor was thus able to perceive at a glance the close ness of the processing of the relics, feared or adored and intended to serve as intercessors between the world of the living and that of the beyond. At the entry of the large rotunda at the extreme left of the gallery, the visitor discovered a series of anthropomorphic reliquaries (in wood, in copper, in silver, or in a mixture of one or another of these sub stances) coming from Germany, France, and Switzerland. She/he could clearly make out, dis played side by side in a circular arc in a long display case with a transparent front, a series of remodeled heads from various Melanesian regions (the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Britain, New Ireland, and the Sepik in PNG. Whereas Christian priests enclosed their relics in metal braid or pre cious wood, those of Oceania covered them with clay, vegetable or mineral putty, and occasionally with iridescent inlays. Both tried to arouse feeling by reproducing as faithfully as possible the visage of the deceased and in this way transforming him into a saint, an ancestor, or a trophy so as to preserve his memory beyond time, oblivion, and death. The third rotunda, called 'le mystère enclos ex.hib ited a series of heads wrapped or enclosed in various materials: the relics from Fribourg-en-Brisgau in Germany, placed on cushions and wrapped in rich cloth, are decorated with gold filigree, embedded with pearls, stones, and teeth. Next to these heads were two korwars (skull or head-holders) from Geelvink Bay, a wooden reliquary from the Solomon Islands, a head from Vella Lavella (the Solomons) contained in a kind of net into which pearls and shells had been worked. A very strange relic covered with mud from the region of Porapora in PNG com pleted this collection. But the most extraordinary relic came from Santa Ana in the Salomon Islands and was shown in a special display case: it was a wooden craving of a bonito whose ventral cavity contained a human skull. The central space, called 'ostension, ' was devoted to various works in which human heads were part of compositions. European relics, covered with a surfeit of precious materials, signs of the sacred pres ence of saints, were placed next to head/skull-hold ers from the Sepik and agiba from the Gulf of Papua. The Swiss reliquary of Saint Coelestina, surfeited with stones, pearls, and silver wire, was placed oppo site a broad Sepik anthropomorphic hook to which i6o Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="2">a remodeled head was attached. This comparison of two radically different ways of presenting the remains of a beloved person illustrated the universal mystery surrounding the deceased. The next two rotundas were devoted to saints and ancestors. The representations were no longer limit ed to heads and skulls but also included bodies. The reclining skeleton of Saint Prosper wrapped in silk and tulle with gold and silver thread, the reliquary armor of Saints Ursus and Mauritius, the amazing reliquary statue of Saint Pancratius (made out of engraved and chiselled silver) from the Wil parish church in Switzerland were judiciously placed next to rambaramp funeral mannequins from Malekula Island in Vanuatu and a very rare malagan sculpture from New Ireland topped with a remodeled head. The large rotunda on the extreme right exhibit ed two paintings placed back to back. On one side, there was an end of the 15th-century German reli quary altar in wood painted red evoking the Garden of Eden. The central part is composed of an extra ordinary arrangement of cloth flowers, precious stones, and long bones surrounded by a series of heads wrapped in cloth. On the other side, there was a large painting several meters long from the Sepik Valley in PNG. This painting, made by applying red, yellow, white, and black pigments to a surface com posed of palm leaves sewn onto a bamboo frame work, formed a stand for ancestor and trophy heads kept in a communal house. The visitor left the exhibition meditating on a Rapa Nui head whose frontal bone is soberly engraved with a motif evoking a bird. The showing of this head, placed at the top of a translucent col umn and slightly lighted at the top, could only strengthen the visitor's examination of the message delivered by this motif as to the relationship between the living and the dead. This exhibition of about a hundred heads and fragments of heads from various religious sites illus trated the universality of the practice of preserving and protecting relics among very different cultures. Comparing these works allowed the visitor to dis cover the recurrent use of red elements: pigments, cloth, stones (garnets), Abrus seeds (the catalogue, pp. 146-47) and the importance of their association with certain vegetables. Each culture has its own lan guage of flowers. Despite the present politically cor rect trend that consists in concealing the achieve ments of the past, the exhibition was a huge success. This success was partially due to Yves Le Fur's refusal to establish a hierarchy in the presentation of the funeral artifacts. He paid no attention to the reli gious ideologies underlying their creation. Indeed, the choice of the works shown in the exhibition would seem to have depended only on the desire to show visitors man's extraordinary creativity in pre serving the memory of the dead. There was no crit icism from the Christian clergy because the exhibi tion was a hymn to secularism (?) through the respect displayed for the different ways of honoring the dead. The exhibition's scenography, conceived by Massimo Quendolo, was sober and bare. It imme diately plunged the visitor into an atmosphere of non-ideological religiosity that encouraged him/her to reflect on and to respect what she/he saw. The scenographer had the excellent idea of hanging, under the six lanterns of the museum's large tempo rary gallery, circular drapes in very light and almost transparent cloth. These hangings demarcated the rotundas and in so doing suggested small chapels or Oceanic cult houses. The display cases containing the heads and the reliquaries were wisely placed at eye level. It was regrettable however that the cards identifying each object were placed flat down on the pieces of furniture supporting the display cases thus making them difficult to read. A 264-page catalogue with copious illustrations in color allowed visitors to learn more about the European and Oceanic works, all of which were unusual. The first part of the catalogue (pp.21-117) is made up of about ten texts reflecting upon the var ious ways of acquiring and preserving relics. The sec ond part (pp. 118-247) gives the list of the works that were included in the show with an explanatory note for each. A bibliography and index complete the Catalogue. Additionally, a sixteen-page, illustrated 'Petit Journal' summed up the various themes of the exhibition which, as Yves Le Fur wrote, neither attempted to compare nor to collate the works, but rather tried to have them admired on the base of the sense and non-sense of each culture represented, thus showing how through the emblem of the head cultural and aesthetic conceptions of great creativi ty were developed.
