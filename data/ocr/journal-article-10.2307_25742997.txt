Journal of Coastal Research, SI 39 (Proccendigs of the 8th International Coastal Symposium), 1459 -1462. Itajai, SC, Brazil, ISSN 0749-0208. The Brazilian coastline has been subject to innumerous accidents with petroleum and its derivatives. They have occurred during loading and/or unloading of petroleum, washing of petroleum tanks with seawater, collisions and shipwrecks resulting in cargo loss. The behavior of the spilt petroleum hydrocarbonates, mainly in the vulnerable mangroves, has been the object of intense research. This is a fragile ecosystem, which, in contact with such products, is submitted to a series of complex processes including the dispersion of these pollutants. The response of the pollutants depends on the receiving environment, on the physical and chemical characteristics of the pollutant, as well as the dynamics of the affected ecosystem. This study attempts to expand knowledge on the effects of petroleum hydrocarbonates in the reproductive cycle oiAvicenia shaueriana, Rizophora mangle, and Laguncularia racemosa in diverse stages of maturity. 3 bio-indicators were used: flowering, fruiting, and embryo. Results were obtained from an environmental evaluation after an accident had occurred during the unloading of petroleum. It was followed by a monitoring campaign over a period of twelve months in Ponta do Padre mangrove, located on the Island of Bom Jesus dos Pobres, state of Bahia, Brazil. Rizophora mangle was the only species of mangrove to prove vulnerable to hydrocarbon contact and suffered modifications in its reproductive cycle.

INTRODUCTION The Bay of Todos os Santos located in the state of Bahia, Brazil is of considerable socio-economic importance to the area. There are many islands in the bay, which are sparsely inhabited, however, the vegetation and rich aquatic diversity of life, particularly in the mangroves, supplies sustenance for the local population. The Island Bom Jesus dos Pobres lies in this bay and is inhabited by approx. 1,000 people. Many benefit from the diversity and from the quantity of crustaceans, mollusks and fish that live there, guaranteeing not only subsistence for them, but also commercialization of the seafood in local towns and cities. However, this island has long suffered environmental impacts from various sources over the years causing significant loss of biodiversity, affecting the equilibrium of the mangroves. In April 1999 the island's coastline suffered the effects of a spill in the unloading of oil. Petrobr?s (Brazilian Federal Oil Company) was responsible for the episode, and adopted measures of recuperation, with technical orientation from the IBAMA Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente (Federal Environmental Agency). Among the measures taken was pruning of the affected vegetation as well as the immediate removal of the oil from mangrove subtract (rocks, sands and mud) and from the surface of the sea. An environmental evaluation was carried out in the affected areas assuring the adoption appropriate mitigation measures. As well as this, the information gathered was used for a subsequent monitoring program to supply information over the following twelve months. This work attempts to contribute information about the effects of oil hydrocarbons on Avicenia shaueriana, Rizophora mangle, Laguncular?a racemosa from the perspective of reproductive cycle of these species at their various stages of development: flowering, fruiting and embryo. Our overall aim is contributing to a planned program of use and management of the waters in the Bay of Todos os Santos, which is compatible with the sustainability of ecosystems in the area. METHODS Description of the Area The area under study is located on the Island of Bom Jesus dos Pobres between the following coordinates: Longitude - 38? 38'45" West ? Latitude -12? 45'30" South &lt;Q SludyArea Figure 1. Map showing the location of the Island Bom Jesus dos Pobres in Bay of Todos os Santos. Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue 39, 2006</page><page sequence="2">1460 Co sta and Alves The Island of Bom Jesus dos Pobres is part of a group of islands in Bahia de Todos os Santos (Fig. 1 ). The total area of this island is approx. 544,000 m2, offers a habitat to a diversity of aquatic life. History The mangroves are inter-tidal wetlands common in tropical and subtropical coastal environments and characteristic of Todos os Santos Bay. Extremely vulnerable ecosystems can be found here. The environmental balance of these mangroves with their subtract and aquatic life have been affected by degradation by various agents over the years. However, this island has long suffered environmental impacts from various sources over the years causing significant loss of biodiversity, affecting the equilibrium of the mangroves. In April 1999 the island's coastline suffered the effects of a spill in the unloading of oil. Petrobr?s (Brazilian Federal Oil Company) was responsible for the episode, and adopted measures of recuperation, with technical orientation from the IBAMA Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente (Federal Environmental Agency). After the spill, removal of buck oil by clean up teams can speed up recovery, by minimizing smothering effecs and chances of asfaltic pavement formation. The main clean up options were: mechanical recovery of oil on the water surface offshore from the mangroves and in mangrove creeks; booming of mangrove shoreline and inlets with use of absorbents materials, with subsequent colletion and disposal. In the affected Area A, the species Laguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana, and Rizophora mangle were pruned and the leaves removed using shears. The top of the plants was not pruned because they were not affected. After the oil covered leaves were removed they were send for incineration to Landulfo Alves Refinery. Among the measures taken was pruning of the affect vegetation as well as the immediate removal of the oil from mangrove subtract (rocks, sands and mud) and from the surface of the sea. Petrobr?s decided to carry out a monitoring plan for 12 months in order to systematically trace the recuperation of the ecosystem. 2 areas were chosen for this programme, area A which was severely affected and was used as a control area as it was not directly affected by the spill. Preliminary Diagnosis An environmental evaluation was carried out in the affect areas assuring the adoption appropriate mitigai measures. As well as this the information guaranteed was used a subsequent monitoring program to supplied information to over the following twelve months. In this study 2 areas on the island were selected. Area A (Ponta do Padre mangrove) was affected by the oil spill which occurred in April 1999. Area was unaffected by the oil spill and was used as a control area. The Area A is located on flat, low subtract subject to tides. The northern part Area A is made up of a large deposit of sediment material of mostly rocks, large and small grain sands and to a lesser extend clay and silt. The southern part of Area is made up of clay and silt of a green colour with abundant organic material mixed in. Area shares the same characteristics as the southern part of Area A. The identification of vegetation and state of the area after the clean up was carried out in field visit for preliminary diagnosis (Figure 2). Mangrove species identified The assessment revealed that the vegetation found in Area A and is predominantly Laguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana, and Rizophora mangle L. confirming that the diversity of the species is much lower in the Americas than in the Asia.

Map showing the areas of study. Mangrove plants live in areas of intense light and high temperatures on unconsolidated soils, anaerobic and periodically flooded with saline water. The high salts content of the surrounding environment tend to dry out their tissues. The adaptations of mangrove plants are normally the characteristics of xerophytes. They have succulent leaves, thickened epidermis and waxy cuticle. They tend to have reduced leaf areas, sunken stornata, smaller cells and high internal pressures. Mangroves plants can tolerate greater salt concentrations in the sap, but some species such as Avicennia shaueriana and Laguncularia racemosa excretes salt through the leaves. Salt excluders (e.g. Rhizophora mangle) allow less salt to enter and concentrate what they get by retaining it in the leaves. (Ucla,2003; Schaeffer-novelli and CiTR? n, 1986; Orge, 1992). The Laguncularia racemosa L., Family Combretaceae, Genera Laguncularia L Gaerm. f. and Avicenia shaueriana Stapf &amp; Leechman, Family Avicenniaceae, Genera Avicennia L (Schaeffer-novelli and Citr?n, 1986; Orge,1992) have special vertical roots, called pneumatophores. The pneumatophores are pencil-like projections of up to 10cm. They are abundant in mangrove swamp mud that is covered at high tide with seawater and project above water at low tide (Ucla, 2003). These structures are thought to be important for oxygenating roots that grow in the anaerobic mud. The function of these specialized roots is to bring the nutrients and air through the lenticels leading to the aenrenchyma tissue. The most intriguing adaptation of mangrove trees is their root system creating an almost impenetrable maze, allowing them to resist current scour and erosion and become established on very fluid mud and unstable substratum. (Ipieca, 1993). The germination of Avicennia is cryptovivipary (not visually obvious) which is exceedingly rare among plants (orge, 1992). The Rizophora mangle Linnaeus, Family Rhizophoraceae, Genera Rizophora L. has predominantly aerial roots, commonly prop roots or even stilt roots of up to 1.5 meters. These roots serve to anchor the plants, but also are important in aeration, because the mangrove mud tends to be anaerobic. Roots also can exhibit development of air cavities in root tissues, designs that aid oxyg?nation of the tissues. Aeration occurs also through lenticels in the bark of this mangrove species. Salt resistance is high and in the leaves sodium and chloride ion levels can exceed 250 millimoles, about half that of sea water. In addition, this most salt-resistant species also tends to show avoidance to salt stress. Avoidance can be achieved by excretion of crystalline salt from glands or hairs of leaves. (Ucla, 2003; orge, 1992). The Rhizophora mangle is the classic example of vivipary Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue 39, 2006</page><page sequence="3">Impacts of Petroleum Hydrocarbonates in the Reproductive Cycle in Brazilian Mangroves 1461 germination, meaning it is able to traverse broad ocean regions by producing large seedlings that float horizontally, undamaged by salinity. These seedlings can be washed up on sand or mud flats, where they settle to establishnewpopulations. In this case, the hypocotyl develops as a long, stiff axis, sometimes exceeding a foot in length (SCHAEFFER-NOVELLl,1995). Vivipary is alleged to be a strategy not only for seawater flotation, a dispersal mechanism, but to avoid the toxic effect that chlorides have on germination. By germinating while on the mother plant, and thereby drawing nutrients under lower salt stress, the young plant can increase its salt resistance before falling into the seawater environment. (UCLA, 2003; ORGE,1992). While the fruit persists on the mother tree, the embryo forms an extremely long hypocotyl. The young seedling will eventually drops from the plant, then either root in surrounding mangrove swamp mud or drift on water potentially to colonize a different site. Viviparous fruits of the red mangrove, Rhizophora mangle hang over water, ready to be dispersed by floating. Even within a dense mangrove swamps, seedlings from the mangrove Family (Rhizophoraceae) occasionally take root. Mangrove trees appear to have special mechanisms to permit them to take up water from the very saline muddy soil without making their water conduits salty. (UCLA, 2003). Monitoring Programme Due to the low mortality rate found and the visible recuperation of the species 4 months after the incident, it was considered not necessary to replant species in the area. However, Petrobr?s decided to carry out a monitoring plan for 12 months in order to systematically trace the recuperation of the ecosystem. Two areas were chosen for this programme, Area A which was severely affected and was used as a control area as it was not directly affected by the spill. The bioindicator used to compare the two areas was the changes in the reproductive cycle of the three species: Laguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana and Rizophora mangle. Within areas A and 2 squares 4X4 meters were selected. In each square examples of each species at varying stages of growth were randomly selected. They were labeled so that they could be easily identified subsequently. RESULTS As much surface oil as possible was removed from rocks, sandy and mud surfaces by a multidisciplinary group of technicians from the oil company responsible for the spill. Remains of oil were found on the leaves of Laguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana and Rizophora mangle. The Monitoring Programme revealed that (Mab consultoria. 1999; Mab consultoria. 2000): The adult plants of the three species showed low but steady regrowth in Area A. The adultplants of Avicenia shaueriana, in the Area A and the Area flowered between September, 1999 and January, 2000; fructifed between November, 1999 andApril, 2000; germinated between January and July, 2000. The adult plants of Laguncularia racemosa in the Area A and the Area flowered between October, 1999 and May, 2000; fructifed between December, 1999 and August, 2000; germinated between May and September, 2000. An exception was found in the adult plants of Rizophora mangle in Area A, whose the reproductive cycle was affected in the stages of flowering, fruiting. In the Area A flowered between March to June, 2000; fructifed between April and July, 2000; germinated between May and August, 2000. But, in the Area flowered between February to July, 2000; fructifed between March and November, 2000; germinated between May and September, 2000. A 1% mortality rate was found among the following species Laguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana and Rizophora mangle in the adult plants. The young plants of the three species showed high levels of survival and average steady regrowth in Area A. At this stage of development the plants' energy was just directed to growth, as they were too young to flower. In Area showed normal growth. A 2% mortality rate was found among the following species Laguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana and Rizophora mangle in the young plants. The Monitoring Programme revealed that the stages of flowering, fruiting the Laguncularia racemosa and Avicenia shaueriana in Area A and were found to be the same. An exception was found in the Rizophora mangle in Area A, whose the reproductive cycle was affected in the stages of flowering, fruiting. The mature embryos of the Laguncularia racemosa and Avicenia shaueriana revealed that in Area A and were found to be the same stages of normal germination. An exception was found in the Rizophora mangle, whose reproductive cycle was affected in the stages of germination in Area A. DISCUSSIONS Effects of spill in the adult plants ofLaguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana and Rizophora mangle. Our suspicion is that in the Area A, the energy stored for the period of flowering and fruiting was probably redirected to leaf regrowth. In Area showed normal growth. According ipieca (1991) this death rate in Area A could be attributed to the spill that may kill organism mainly through (which is a physical effect) rather than through acute toxic effects. Thus a crude oil spill which reaches a shore quickly will be more toxic to the shore life than if the slick has been weathering at sea for several days before stranding. According to Patin (1999), to the spill that damage the physiological processes and functions of reproduction, feeding, and respiration with asphyxia of the roots because of the obstruction of lenticels where the essential gas exchanges occurs, changes in the cell membrane permeability causing the rupture of the plasmatic membrane, which impedes the absorption of nutrients. According to ipieca (1993), mangroves can also be killed through the toxicity of substances in the oil, especially lower molecular weigth aromatic compounds, which damage cell membranes in the subsurface roots. This in turn impairs the normal salt exclusion process, and the resulting influx of salt is a source of stress to the plants. But could be attributed also to other anthropomorphic activities such as the depositing of household waste, deforestation of the mangrove, sewage and fuel spills from local fishing boats (orge, 1992). The young plants of Laguncularia racemosa, Avicenia shaueriana and Rizophora mangle - Our suspicion is that at this stage of development the plants' energy was just directed to growth, as they were too young to flower. In Area showed normal growth. According to Patin (1999), this death rate in Area A could be attributed to the spill and other anthropomorphic activities that damage the respiratory organs. The mature embryos of Rizophora mangle - Our suspicion is that the low rate of germination could be attributed to the spill and damage of the obstruction of respiratory system or could be to the other anthropomorphic activities that damage the respiratory organs (Patin, 1999). According Ipieca (1991), winter oiling of a salt marsh can affect over wintering seeds and reduce germination in the spring. Marked reduction of flowering can occur if plants are oiled when the flower buds are developing, even though there may be good vegetative recovery, there is loss of send production for that year. The flowering and fruiting stages of Rizophora mangle - Our suspicion that the sandy and mud parts the hydrocarbons were trapped among the grains causing a mechanical impact affecting the plants metabolism with your toxic effects (Patin, 1999; Citr?n and Schaeffer-novelli, 1982; Citr?n et al, 1982). According orge (1992), the pruning and removal of the leaves would consume all the energy stored for flowering and Journal of Coastal Research, Special Issue 39, 2006</page><page sequence="4">1462 Costa and Alves fruiting was proved unfounded in the cases of Laguncularia racemosa and Avicenia shaueriana. Area showed normal flowering and fruiting in all species. According IPIECA (1993), over time several factors reduce the toxicity of oil deposited in mangrove forests: by rain and tides; some of the more toxic volatile fractions evaporate and chemical changes such as oxidation make the residual oil less toxic. Oil degradation can be rapid in the tropics and there are instances of natural seedling establishment and growth in oiled soil. CONCLUSIONS Sensitivity to hydrocarbon contact varies according to Mangrove species, rizophora mangle was the only species of mangrove to prove vulnerable to hydrocarbon contact and suffered modifications in its reproductive cycle. The Rizophora mangle was the only species in Area A to have its reproductive cycle affected in the stages of flowering, fruiting and germination through contact with hydrocarbons. The low death rate in Area A could be attributed to high temperature, degree of exposure to wave energy and wind speeds increase evaporation, which leads to a decrease in toxicity of remaining on the water. Temperature affect the viscosity of the oil, and so the ease with which it can dispersed. In Area showed normal flowering, fruiting and germination among all species with other anthropomorphic activities such as the depositing of household waste, deforestation of the mangrove, sewage and fuel spills from local fishing boats, but without oil. However, to conclude that the hydrocarbon cleaning process was effective for the two of the three species is difficult. We do not have information about the area A before the spill, nor data from area Abefore undergoing cleaning. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Dr Adelino Mendon?a Sobrinho. Julian Herm?genes Quezada Celed?n.
