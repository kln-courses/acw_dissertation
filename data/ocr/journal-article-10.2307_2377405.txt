<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHRISTIAN ETHIC OF WAR. By P. T. Forsyth, M.A., D.D. London: Longmans, Green &amp; Company, 1916. Pp. x, 196. Price, 6s. net. This is a sincere and earnest rather than a clear or a convinc- ing book. As an argumentum ad hominem addressed to the Con- scientious Objector, whose influence in the Free Churches is far from being a negligible quantity, it is often telling; "to pay taxes . . . is to be as much a partner in the war as fighting would be-with the added enormity of paying others to do an immoral thing which the protector evades by buying himself off ": and it is refreshing to come upon the admission that "Casuistry Vol. XXVII.-No. 3. 9</page><page sequence="2">400 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. every one has to practice; the question is whether we should use amateur or skilled." But the writer is hampered by a theory of the Atonement without which, he admits, "all I have just been saying falls to the ground as a speculative fantasy," but which few theologians would now discuss seriously. This leaves him open to criticism from more than one side. There are, it seems, three separate Dr. Forsyths: the first as he is, a Puritan of the Cromwellian type, soaked in the Old Testament; the second as he sees himself, an Evangelical Christian nurtured on the New-though on Paul, not on Jesus; the third as he would have others see him, a moral philosopher in revolt against modern ethical conceptions, which (he thinks) lead to what he denounces as an "anthropomorphic religion. That is, its prime interest is man with God to help him. (Ps: xxiii) "-surely a respect- able ancestry?-but "it ends in subjective humanism, with God squeezed out." Unlike the Athanasian Trinity, these three are not one. It would be unfair to compare The Christian Ethic of War to Monsignor Benson's Dawn of All. But a certain purple patch in the latter work will not unfrequently occur to the reader of the former: "The Christ you appeal to is nothing. Have you never heard of the Wrath of the Lamb? " The points which Dr. Forsyth wishes to make would have been brought out more clearly had he avoided the obscure theology of the Atonement, and taken them on general rather than on distinctively religious ground. " Whoever expects to find in Scripture a specific direction for every moral doubt that arises, looks for more than he will meet with," says Paley. And, while in a historical sense we may speak of "Christian Ethics" with propriety-what is meant being the development of Ethics in Christian Europe-to do so in the sense of a distinct kind, or species, of Ethics, standing over against other kinds, or species, is open to misconception. For the science of conduct is rational, rather than either Christian or non-Christian; and it is one. The distinction between rational and Christian exists for thought rather than in things. There is, no doubt, a difference of accent and emphasis, to miss which is to land oneself in a rather arid intellectualism. But, in substance, Christianity is a republi- cation, re-statement, and reinforcement of the dictates of reason. Hence its power of development; it grows as reason grows. So that an interpretation, whether of Scripture or of Christianity, which is in conflict with reason and with the institutions in which</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS. 401 reason embodies itself-Society, Law, the State-is self-refuted. Such positions are better argued not on the ground of religion- this would be endless-but on that of reason. They are unreason- able, i.e., intellectually foolish, and therefore (we may insist upon the consequence), morally wrong. It follows that they are not, and cannot be, Christian: the great text of the Cambridge Platonists was "The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord." Where the argument is conducted on other lines, it is difficult to avoid the shoals of religious controversy. To the non-theolog- ical reader it will probably seem that in the present work the author's interest is rather theological than ethical; to the theo- logical reader it will seem that the particular theology in whose interest the book has been written is one which has no future and which has had a more than doubtful past.
