<plain_text><page sequence="1">Supernatural as a Western Category BENSON SALER I In "Ojibwa Ontology, Behavior, and World View," Professor Hallowell writes that the appellation "supernatural persons," if applied to characters in the myths of the northern Ojibwa, "is completely misleading, if for no other reason than the fact that the concept of 'supernatural' presupposes a concept of the 'natural.' The latter is not present in Ojibwa thought" (1960:28).1 He adds that "It is unfortunate that the natural-supernatural dichotomy has been so persistently invoked by many anthropologists in describing the outlook of peoples in cultures other than our own" (1960:28). Like many another anthropologist in recent years, Hallowell BENSON SALER is associate professor and chairman of the Department of Anthropology at Brandeis University. He has carried out field work among Quiche in Guatemala and Guajiro in Colombia and Venezuela. I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Drs. Alexander Altmann, Wil- liam A. Johnson, and Douglas J. Stewart for their critical comments on an early draft of this paper. I am also grateful to Dr. Owsei Temkin for a stimulating discussion of the development of notions about magic and medicine as they relate to ideas about "nature" and "the natural." 1. Another student of the Ojibwa had made a somewhat similar point, that "to call these beings supernatural slightly misinterprets the Indians' conception" (Jenness 1935:29 as quoted by Levi-Strauss 1966 [1962]:37). Jenness, however, went on to assert that these beings "are a part of the natural order of the universe no less than man himself, whom they resemble" in certain respects.</page><page sequence="2">32 * ETHOS warns us that "a thoroughgoing 'objective' approach to the study of cultures cannot be achieved solely by projecting upon those cultures categorical abstractions derived from Western thought. For, in a broad sense, the latter are a reflection of our cultural sub- jectivity" (1960:21). But Hallowell does not go so far as some of the more extreme proponents of this viewpoint. That is, as his use of the word "solely" would seem to suggest, he does not call for the rigid suppression or suspension of our categories. It is appro- priate that he does not, for it is difficult to imagine how we might apprehend the natives' representations in any way that is thoroughly independent of our own. Rather, with his characteristic judicious- ness, Hallowell advises us to adopt "a perspective which includes an analysis of the outlook of the people themselves as a comple- mentary procedure" (1960:21)-complementary, that is, to the unavoidable employment of our own categorical abstractions in recognizing problems and in groping for understandings. Ethnoscientists have sensitized us to the high probability of dis- torting the natives' perspectives should we simplistically impose our categories on them. That point has been so cogently and force- fully argued that I need not belabor it here. I do, however, want to focus attention on a related danger-a subtle danger that may well be severely pernicious in its own right insofar as the ethno- graphic enterprise is concerned. If, as Hallowell and others sup- pose, we do make some significant use of our own categories in the discovery of native categories and in the refinement of our under- standings, it behooves us to reflect on the semantics and pragmatics of our own categories. Various anthropologists have justly decried the use of Western folk categories as if they were well-explored analytical constructs. In point of fact, we may sometimes entertain rather foggy notions of what those categories supposedly mean in our own society. In such cases the casual application of our cate- gory labels to various of the collective representations of other peoples becomes doubly problematical and, in the final analysis (should there be a final analysis), it is likely to prove only speci- ously convenient. Such, I submit, may be the case for "superna- tural" in the exploration of non-Western world views. Hallowell (1960:28) quotes Arthur O. Lovejoy (1935:12) to the point that the word nature "is probably the most equivocal in the vocabulary of the European peoples," and he notes but does not</page><page sequence="3">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 33 elaborate on the statement (save for two references) that "the natural-supernatural antithesis has had its own complex history in Western thought." In this paper I take up certain highlights in the development of ideas about the supernatural in Western civili- zation. I do so in the conviction that investigations of this sort can yield three sorts of benefits over and above the intellectual pleasure that they afford. First, a clarification of the different meanings that are likely to attach to our own folk categories will better enable us to decide whether or not we might defensibly and usefully employ any of those senses in our professional deliberations. With regard to super- natural, for example, there are two distinct questions that come to mind: whether or not to utilize the term in describing discrete non-Western world views and whether or not to make use of the term in formulating general definitions of religion. Second, a deeper appreciation of our Western categories, gained through the exercise of exploring them, ought to sharpen our sen- sitivities and sensibilities in exploring other peoples' categories. Third, tracing the developmental histories of various Western categories affords us a rare opportunity to study in great time depth diverse processes attendant on the formulation and modifi- cation of world views. When we attempt to investigate such pro- cesses among nonliterate populations we usually lack much in the way of a rich and deep longitudinal perspective. Fortunately, how- ever, twenty-five hundred years of Western thought are available to us, thanks in no small measure to generations of humanist scholars who have dedicated themselves to preserving and clarify- ing it. Within the Western tradition we can trace, often with con- siderable confidence, how people challenged, modified, or rejected each other's constructs and models in light of their differential apperceptions of a multiplicity of problems over a vast span of time. II The Oxford English Dictionary gives as its first definition of supernatural "That is above nature; belonging to a higher realm or system than that of nature; transcending the powers or the ordi- nary course of nature." In questionnaires that I administered to three populations of undergraduate students at Brandeis Univer-</page><page sequence="4">34 * ETHOS sity, some of the definitions of supernatural given by the respon- dents approximated fairly closely to that definition. Others, how- ever, diverged, sometimes in the direction of emphasizing that things supernatural are not directly amenable to sensory percep- tion or human control and understanding. These definitional pro- pensities, moreover, were often locked into vague or seemingly contradictory statements. But while the definitions given varied widely in content and in relative sophistication, those student re- spondents who were asked to sort objects as either "supernatural" or "not supernatural" exhibited considerable convergence in the sorting task. Thus, for example, most agreed that "Dracula" is "supernatural" whereas Frankenstein's monster is not; in justifying the latter sorting, respondents variously stated that the monster was "man-made," that Baron Frankenstein was a "scientist" ap- plying his "science," and so forth.2 Most social scientists who employ the term "supernatural" in the sources that I have examined do not state precisely what it is that they mean by it. While there seems to be, in effect, a wide consensus as to the actual sortings that are to be made in including things under the rubric supernatural, definitions, with certain notable exceptions, are usually skimpy if, indeed, they are given at all. Broadly speaking, however, I discern two major applications of the term in the social science literature. The first is a very general usage: supernatural is employed as a broad cover term for a variety of postulated entities, forces, or "beings" that are usually denominated "spiritual" or "superhu, man" and whose effects surpass those possible of achievement by ordinary human capabilities (see, for example, Spiro 1967:3). The second major application does not really contrast with the first; rather, it explicates and refines it, though by so doing it em- bodies or tends to suggest certain antimetaphysical biases that the more general application does not endorse in any deliberate or immediate fashion. Durkheim (1965 [1912]) provides us with an example. He maintains, as does Evans-Pritchard (1937:80-81) and Hallowell (1960:28), that supernatural presupposes or entails some concept of the "natural." "In order to say that certain things are supernatural," Durkheim writes, "it is necessary to have the senti- ment that a natural order of things exists, that is to say, that the 2. The Golem of Prague seemed to impress the respondents as a bit more problematical, though most concluded that it is "supernatural."</page><page sequence="5">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 35 phenomena of the universe are bound together by necessary rela- tions, called laws" (1965:41). But he elaborates on this theme to a greater extent, and with greater severity, than does either Hallowell or Evans-Pritchard. By "supernatural," says Durkheim, "is understood all sorts of things which surpass the limits of our knowledge; the supernatural is the world of the mysterious, of the unknowable, of the un- understandable" (1965:39). But this sense of mystery "is not of primitive origin" (1965:43). The forces in which the primitive believes, though different from those of modern science, are for him "no more unintelligible than are gravitation and electricity for the physicist of today" (1965:40). Even though those forces are frequently thought of "under the form of spiritual beings or con- scious wills," this in itself is no proof that they are irrational, for "The reason has no repugnance a priori to admitting that the so-called inanimate bodies should be directed by intelligences" (1965:40). For the primitive, as Durkheim conceives him, the uni- verse is not really terribly complex, let alone mysterious. "It is science and not religion which has taught men that things are complex and difficult to understand" (1965:42), and it is our re- cently acquired appreciation of "the immutability and the inflexi- bility of the order of things" (1965:41) that disposes us to con- template posited exceptions as being marvelous and mysterious. Indeed, "In order to arrive at the idea of the supernatural," events so labeled must be conceived of as being "impossible"-"that is to say, irreconcilable with an order which, rightly or wrongly, appears to us to be implied in the nature of things" (1965:43).3 This idea 3. While both Hallowell and Evans-Pritchard conceive of the supernatural as being opposed to the natural and as being inexplicable by reference to natural laws, neither of them, insofar as I am aware, explicitly endorsed the "sense of the impossible" recommended by Durkheim (1965:43) and accepted to an extent by L6vy-Bruhl (1936:5). Evans-Pritchard expressed himself in these words: "We have a notion of an ordered world conforming to what we call natural laws, but some people in our society believe that mysterious things can happen which cannot be accounted for by reference to natural laws and which therefore are held to transcend them, and we call these happenings supernatural. To us supernatural means very much the same as abnormal or extraordinary" (1937:80). But "abnormal" and "extraordinary," as I understand those words, are not quite the same thing as "impossible." Nor does a failure to account for something by reference to natural laws necessarily mean that that something is "irreconcilable" with natural laws. Levy-Bruhl maintains that "although primitives . . . can clearly differen- tiate things that appear supernatural from those that occur in the ordinary course of nature, they rarely imagine them as separate, for in them 'the sense of the impossible' is lacking" (1936:5). The supernatural, in his view,</page><page sequence="6">36 * ETHOS of a necessary order, Durkheim avers, has been constructed by the positive sciences. The contrary idea, the idea of the supernatural "as we understand it," is dependent on it and thus of very recent origin: "even the greatest thinkers of classical antiquity never suc- ceeded in becoming fully conscious of it" (1965:41). It would there- fore be inappropriate to base a universal definition of religion on beliefs in "supernatural" entities or forces. Moreover, once we admit that "the phenomena of the universe are bound together by necessary relations, called laws," whatever is contrary to them must ipso facto appear to be irrational, for those laws express "the man- ner in which things are logically related" (1965:41). Now in Durkheim's statements about "the idea of the super- natural, as we understand it," the phrase "as we understand it" is quite important. Some may be inclined to dismiss his stipulated understanding because it strikes them as suggesting a brassy posi- tivism. To do so, however, would be as biographically unjust as it is argumentatively unreasonable: Durkheim avoided describing himself as a positivist, and he distinguished his general intellectual position from "the positivist metaphysics" of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer (Lukes 1972:72-73). Of real relevance to the question of whether or not we ought to adopt Durkheim's under- standing is the matter of intellectual history. The term "supernatural" and cognate words in various Euro- pean languages were employed long before the rise of the modern natural sciences. Durkheim insists that "the idea of the super- natural" in his sense "dates only from today" because it depends on the "idea of universal determinism," and that idea is "a conquest of the positive sciences" (1965:41). What, then, about other, older meanings that attach to supernatural? Do they not deserve some hearing? One also wonders if Durkheim might not have overstated the case somewhat in asserting the contemporaneity of ideas about "natural laws," "universal determinism," and the sense of the "impossible." Modern scientific thought does of course differ con- is manifested in primitive mentation by attention to "unseen powers," prompted by emotional dispositions. He argues that supernatural is ulti- mately an "affective category," that is, that its primary significance must be understood as being largely emotional and evocative. While primitive man may not confuse the worlds of the natural and the supernatural "in their essence," he tells us, "it often happens that he does not differentiate between them" (1936:34).</page><page sequence="7">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY ? siderably from that of Greek philosophy or of High Scholasticism. It has-more or less-jettisoned notions of primal substances, es- sential essences, and first causes, emancipating itself to a notable extent from obvious dependence on metaphysical speculation.4 Nevertheless, there are broad continuities in thought that span millenia: a conviction that the exercise of human reason can dis- cover order in the manifold phenomena of nature, and the ancillary conviction that that order can be described and in some sense ac- counted for by the framing of general propositions or lawlike statements. In pursuit of their inquiries into the order of nature, some of the premoderns approximated in varying degrees to conceptions of natural law, determinism, and even "impossibility" of the sort espoused by Durkheim's scientific contemporaries-they came close enough, at any rate, to make room for the supernatural by speculative contrast, though their reasoned systems did not always implicate it. Aristotle, after all, viewed the universe as operating in a rational and intelligible manner, according to necessity but not transcendental design. The Stoics were celebrated for their interest in natural laws- and castigated, eventually, by various Christian writers for their materialist theology. Saint Thomas Aquinas, who played a major role in developing a technical theology of the supernatural, was hardly adverse to conceiving of the operation of natural laws, and, like Durkheim, he insisted on an indissoluble association between such laws and rationality. And when it comes to conceiving of "impossible" events (Durkheim 1965:43), who can match Tertullian in the shock value of paradox?: The Son of God was crucified; it is not shameful because it ought to cause shame. And the Son of God died; it is believable because it can't be grasped. And having been entombed, he arose; it is certain because it is impossible (De Came Christi V, 4). Any concept of the supernatural would seem to require or pre- 4. This is rather less the case in the social and psychological sciences than in the "physical" (from the Greek) or "natural" (from the Latin) sciences. "Such words as 'mind,' 'subject,' 'self,' 'person,' 'the individual,' to say nothing of 'value,'" John Dewey (1944:2) reminds us, "are more than tinged in their current usage (which affects willy-nilly philosophical formulations) with significations they absorbed from beliefs of an extranatural character. There is almost no word employed in psychological or societal analysis and descrip- tion that does not reflect this influence." 37</page><page sequence="8">38 * ETHOS suppose some concept of the natural. The reverse, however, is not true. Various of "the greatest thinkers of classical antiquity" ar- rived at rather sophisticated ideas about nature and the natural order without requiring some contrastive category of a transcen- dental or wholly separated supernatural order. For some the most interesting opposition was conceptualized as a contrast between nature and art. And, or so I shall argue, even Christian thinkers through the fifth century did not really develop theologically sig- nificant usages of supernatural. This generalization admits of some exceptions, to be sure. The most notable is probably Saint Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444). He employed the Greek expression huper phusin in his theology of grace when postulating man's elevation 'above nature' through Christ (Kenny 1967:812). Generally speak- ing, however, for the Church Fathers, as for many Jews of that and earlier times, the most arresting and crucial of oppositions was between creator and creature. Nevertheless, a natural-supernatural opposition took root and flourished in the soil of Christianity. When we examine statements about the Order of Grace offered by certain mediaeval schoolmen we encounter it in blossom. The sowing of the seeds from which it sprang, however, occurred long before that. III The sixth century B.C. School of Miletus is generally credited with beginning critical philosophy in Western civilization. Those Ionian Greeks developed critical attitudes toward received doc- trines and myths, and among them it was apparently not unusual for students to propound theories that explicitly diverged from those of their masters. As Karl Popper (1972:348) admiringly puts it, "doubt and criticism ... become . . . part of the tradition of the school," and in the course of critical discussions "observation is called in as a witness." The Milesian philosophers are of interest to us not only because of their critical attitude, but also because they engaged in syste- matic speculation about phusis, a term that is often glossed into English as 'nature' (the Greek Fathers of the Church employed that term; churchmen writing in Latin substituted the Latin word natura for it). The Milesians came to be known as phusikoi, 'physi- cists', or phusiologoi, 'students' or 'theorists' of phusis. The term phusis is polysemic, and its various meanings and</page><page sequence="9">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 39 career in Greek thought are difficult to deal with briefly. In Sand- bach's concise summation, the word literally means 'growth', "then 'the way a thing grows', and by extension 'the way a thing acts and behaves'. By a further extension it came to mean 'the force that causes a thing to act and behave as it does'" (1975:31). Jaeger (1947:20) points out that it denotes the act of phunai, "the process of growth and emergence," but that it also includes the source of origin of things-"that from which they have grown, and from which their growth is constantly renewed-in other words, the reality underlying the things of our experience." The luminaries of the Milesian School were Thales, Anaxi- mander, and Anaximenes. In a more-or-less conventional view of them (see, for example, Collingwood 1945), they purportedly sup- posed that the multiplicity of different objects encountered in experience derived from the existence or action of some original 'substance' or 'ground principle' (Jaeger 1947). Our knowledge of the Milesians, however, is scanty indeed. The major source on them is Theophrastus, one of Aristotle's students, and the small corpus of fragments attributed to them is in large measure dubi- ous. Stokes declares that "Practically any statement concerning Milesian linguistic usage is based on nothing but conjecture" (1971:64), so that we can neither accept nor reject with certainty the oft-voiced claim that the Milesians were principally concerned with how the many things of heaven and earth arose from one thing, the one becoming many. In any event, virtually nowhere in the conventional picture of the Milesians do we find any suggestion of clear transcendence, of a creator being outside of nature (see, however, Collingwood 1945:32). Quite the contrary, in fact, seems to be the case. In Guthrie's pointed historical characterization, "no European" before the Milesians "had set out to satisfy his curiosity about the world in the faith that its apparent chaos concealed a permanent and in- telligible order, and that the natural order could be accounted for by universal causes operating within nature itself and discoverable by human reason," and that in attempting so to account for the natural order the Milesians "consciously rejected the mythical and religious tradition of their ancestors, in particular its belief in the agency of anthropomorphic gods" (1967:441). Greek naturalism took account of ta onta, 'the things that are', and it sought to make them comprehensible. While it is true that</page><page sequence="10">40 * ETHOS the philosophers called in "observation ... as a witness," they dis- agreed among themselves as to the relative weighting of sensate experience and reason. Parmenides of Elea thrust the latter into sharp relief, claiming that reality is unitary and unchanging, that it can be apprehended only by thought, and that the sensible world deceives us. The Eleatic preference for reason over the testimony of the senses later reached perhaps its most elevated development in some of the writings of Plato. In various of his works the intelligible is powerfully distinguished from the sensible and we are confronted by the famous theory of forms. The theory of forms is popularly taken to be the core of "Platonism." It is, indeed, with regard to the ontology of forms (as expressed, e.g., in the Phaedo) that we encounter Platonic transcendence. A plate made by a potter is an imperfect circle; our senses deceive us if we suppose that it is per- fectly round. But a perfect circle does exist: it exists as a concept in a superior world of concepts that can be apprehended only by reason. The ideal forms of that world are eternal and immutable. They are, if you will, more real than their transitory, mutable approximations in the world of sensate experience. Platonic trans- cendence exalts the perfect over the imperfect, the changeless over the changing, and it celebrates the superiority of ratiocination over dependence on sensation. It does not, however, coincide with "su- pernatural," either in that term's common contemporary accepta- tions or in the meaning assigned to it by Durkheim. (Nor does the artisan-god of the Timaeus appear to be supernatural in any signi- ficant metaphysical sense.) We do not find some clearly recognizable sense of our "super- natural" in Aristotle any more than in Plato, and this despite Aristotle's talk about the necessity of a "mover" in nature. Aris- totle (d. 322 B.C.) gives several somewhat different definitions of nature, but for our purposes it will suffice to cite this passage in his writings: nature in the primary and strict sense is the essence of things which have in themselves, as such, a source of movement; for the matter is called the nature because it is qualified to receive this, and processes of becoming and growing are called nature because they are move- ments proceeding from this. And nature in this sense is the source of the movement of natural objects, being present in them somehow, either potentially or in complete reality. (Metaphysics, Delta 1015a)</page><page sequence="11">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 41 We read in the Physics (257b), however, that "it is impossible that that which moves itself should in its entirety move itself." Aristotle's theory of nature, as Woodbridge (1965:55) notes, is largely a theory of motion. In accounting for the movements of natural things, Aristotle proposed that there is an ultimate cause of motion, a Prime Mover separate from the world of nature, an Unmoved Mover which is immaterial, eternal, and immutable, and which we may call God (theos). The Aristotelian Prime Mover, however, does not act by free will. It is, as Maimonides pointed out, an "intellectual principle" in a theory of causality (Wolfson 1941:152), a final cause in an order of endless necessity. The world is uncreated and eternal, and God is not its designer. God, how- ever, is the ultimate source of regularity and purposive action in nature because imperfect nature strives to imitate God's perfection. Aristotle's order of nature is ultimately an order of teleological striving that admits of a transcendental causal principle but not of supernatural design and determination. We do not encounter the supernatural among the greatest of the Greek philosophers, nor do we find it among their chief rivals, the poets. The poets, who tried to convey truth through metaphor and to invoke it by touching the emotions, in effect sang of two analyti- cally distinguishable sorts of gods. One sort of god is an anthropomorphic being. He (or she) is filled with purpose and very often passion. We meet such gods in Hesiod, where we find that they themselves are created, engen- dered, or generated. We meet them also in Homer, where it be- comes clear that the gods are part of nature, not outside of it. They differ from men in being deathless-this is the hallmark of the divine-and in having greater powers. But they, too, are subject to their moira, their lot or portion, their destiny. The other sort of god is an abstract principle, a depersonalized verity that is a "god" because it endures far longer than does an individual person. The poets' gods, in short, are by no means "supernatural," and the Greek term theds does not have quite the same meanings as Judaeo-Christian-Islamic words for God: The question, as Wilamowitz acutely observed in Der Glaube der Hellenen, is never really, what will we say of gods (or, by extension, spiritual realities), but what will we say is a god: how widely will we choose to extend the concept Theos, which is essentially a predicate,</page><page sequence="12">42 * ETHOS not a subject, to any number of phenomena which we find important and meaningful? So that when Euripides writes (Helen 560), "Recog- nizing friends is also a god," we have to conclude that "god" and everything else in the "supernatural" apparatus of classical civilization in a sense means that which is eternal, uncontrollable by human plan or will, and possibly, therefore, somehow sacred, but in no way superior to, lantithetical to, or a substitute for, human ideals, aspirations, or goals (Douglas J. Stewart, personal communication). The classical Greeks, philosopher and poet alike, sometimes made use of the adjective huperphues. It is tempting to gloss it 'super- natural'-it could conceivably be used to mean that. In classical usage, however, it meant (depending on context) 'overgrown', 'tangled', 'enormous', 'monstrous', 'outlandish', and so forth- even, in some contexts, 'superior'. It has the primary sense of 'growing above ground'. We find it used, for example, in Demo- critus's somewhat "Tylorian" theory of the origin of religion. In the tradition passed on to us by Sextus Empiricus (Diels 1960:178, Sext. adv. math. IX 19, Democ. B, 166), Democritus envisaged the images that people see in their dreams and identify as apparitions of the gods as "megala te kai huperphue kai dusphtharta mdn," 'large and exceeding human stature and hard to destroy'. Exceed- ing human stature, but not "supernatural," "as we understand it." The Latin expression, supra naturam excedens, was employed rather like the Greek huperphues, and it seems doubtful that the Romans arrived at an explicit formulation of the supernatural. They were interested, to be sure, in the uncanny, but we have little reason to suppose that they drew a sharp boundary between a natural realm and a preternatural-that-is-supernatural realm. Like the Greeks, the Romans seemed to regard the gods as products of a natural order rather than its creators, and hence the participation of the gods in that order was not supernatural. IV When we turn to early Christianity, the intellectual currents flow more swiftly toward the supernatural. We find in early Chris- tianity a vigorous emphasis on a transcendental creator, an empha- sis that derives in the main from Jewish sources.5 5. At different times and in different places individuals, with or without followings, have advocated the immanence of God in the world rather than the deity's transcendent separation from it. Such persons have appeared</page><page sequence="13">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 43 In Hebrew thought, Raven (1953:26) observes, "God's relation- ship to the world was represented as external and transcendental." God creates the world and all that it contains in successive acts, in a sequence of verbal fiats ('let there be light', 'let there be an ex- panse in the midst of the water', etc.), each of which is descriptively preceded in the Book of Genesis by the formula "vayomer elohim," 'And God said'. The Hebrew "Logos," Jaeger (1947:16-17) writes, "is a substantialization of an intellectual property or power of God the creator, who is stationed outside the world," and it contrasts sharply with the Greek idea of gods who "are stationed inside the world . . . and are generated by the mighty power of Eros, who likewise belongs within the world as an all-engendering primitive force." The early Fathers of the Church accepted the Jewish view of a transcendental creator apart from nature, and they accepted the idea of revelation as a source of knowledge about him. But while it might be argued that supernatural could be posited for them as a covert category or "cryptotype," they apparently did not employ it as an overt concept. Kenny (1967:812) tells us that no word that might be glossed 'supernatural' is to be found in the New Testa- ment, the patristic writings of the early centuries, or the ancient liturgical texts. The fundamental opposition celebrated by the Church Fathers was not between the supernatural and the natural, but rather, it seems to me, between the creator and his creation. Indeed, the major in-house debate over the nature of Christ im- mediately referred to those latter opposites. Given an uncomprom- ising monism, it was argued that if Christ were of the same 'being' or 'substance' as the Father, he would pertain to the domain of the creator, whereas if he were of a similar 'being' or 'substance' he would merely be a creature, a creation, regardless of how otherwise exalted and powerful he might be. The domain of creation included not only human beings and other objects that we would describe as "natural," but also entities that we should probably term "spiritual": angels, for example, and demons. God (in whatever number of Persons) is clearly separate from all that he created. One of the interesting things about this portioning of objects to categories is its lack of iso- among celebrants in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and sometimes the intimacy or equation between God and nature that they depicted induced others to label them "pantheists."</page><page sequence="14">44 * ETHOS morphy with our contemporary assignment of objects. We, of course, would put angels and demons in the same box as God, and label it "supernatural," while putting human beings, elephants, and whatnot into a different box, labeled "natural." The early Church Fathers did not divide up things in that way, however, because our natural-supernatural distinction was not salient for them. The creator-creation opposition was what held their atten- tion. When, then, one of our foremost contemporary authorities on the development of Christian thought describes that patristic opposition under the rubric of "The Supernatural Order" (Peli- kan 1971:132-141), he may well be engaging in a projection of categorical abstractions of the sort that Hallowell (1960:21) char- acterized as "a reflection of our cultural subjectivity."6 The relationship between creator and creation contained in the pivotal patristic opposition was carried to something of an extreme by Saint Augustine (d. 430). He held that all of creation existed at the will of God. The 'natural' is epiphenomenal to God's pleasure and is dependent on it for its continuance. Indeed, all of nature represents God's intervention and abiding interest, and nature itself is in this sense miraculous (City of God, X, 12). This formulation effectively rules out a stable natural-supernatural dichotomy. The eventual development of a clear concept of the superna- tural in Christian theology was promoted both by dialogues with heretics and by the influence of Neoplatonic philosophy. In the early centuries of its history, Christian dogma was chal- lenged by an assemblage of doctrines collectively referred to as "Gnosticism." In a broad sense Christianity was itself a species of Gnosticism in that it sought salvation through 'knowledge' (gnosis) gained by revelation. In a narrow sense (the sense used here), however, Gnosticism consisted of teachings, sometimes promul- gated by persons who styled themselves Christians, that were un- acceptable to mainstream Christianity. Many of the Gnostics taught that the spiritual was inherently good whereas the physical-material was inherently evil, and that men of knowledge might liberate 6. In a somewhat analogous case-Boas's (1940 [1927]) gloss of two Kwakiutl terms as, respectively, 'supernatural' and 'profane', and his descrip- tion of what belongs under each rubric-Werner Cohn has observed that "'natural' and 'supernatural' are not kept distinct in our senses of these words, and . . .

Salvation for the Gnostics was a freeing of the spiritual from whatever pre- vented it from attaining true spiritual coherence. Patristic Christianity also recognized a distinction between mat- ter and spirit (matter, indeed, was created by spirit), and it pic- tured a chasm between good and evil. It did not, however, endorse the Gnostic notion that the physical-material aspects of the universe are evil in themselves (Van Groningen 1967:30). Further, the Church Fathers strenuously rejected Gnostic notions to the effect that the deity of the Old Testament is a demiurge inescapably as- sociated with the evils of the world and distinct from the true crea- tor who is a remote and essentially unknowable God. But in com- bating Gnostic dualisms, Christian thinkers elaborated a dualism that they did endorse, a distinction between matter and spirit that they shared to a significant extent with the Gnostics. And while they did not regard the world as evil in itself, as evil in essence, they clearly regarded things spiritual as ultimately more desirable than things material. These points of view, I think, paved the way for the eventual advancement and acceptance of a theology of the supernatural. In defending Christianity against its theological adversaries, Christian spokesmen not only defended dogma but created it. Many of the writings of the Church Fathers are, in fact, attacks on their Jewish, Gnostic, Manichaean, and other intellectual opponents, and the doctrines that they espouse were shaped dialectically. There was, indeed, much overlap in the competing world views, and it would doubtless prove fascinating to inquire into the exis- tential conditions that might have encouraged apocalyptic Chris- tians and many of their adversaries to entertain similar attitudes and understandings. In particular, we should like to understand better the apparent development of a certain disenchantment with the world and a search for completion on the spiritual plane, a search often spurred by faith and by Neoplatonic speculation. Neoplatonism is our label for certain philosophical elaborations on Platonic themes. The Neoplatonic tradition, so-called, is gen- erally held to have begun with Plotinus (d. 270 A.D.) and to have suffered a mortal blow (though its ghost lingers on) in 529, when Justinian ordered the closing of the academy in Athens. The Neoplatonists conceived of a 'god' or principle so transcending the universe that it cannot be described in the predicates of ordinary</page><page sequence="16">46 * ETHOS language. Often referred to as the 'One', it is the source from which all the things of the universe are derived through 'emana- tions'. Things thus derived have not fully separated out from the One, and so in this respect the transcendent One is immanent in everything. The Neoplatonists were generally pagans, and they were for the most part hostile to Christianity. In the philosophical position espoused by many of them, "the universe was a spontaneous pro- duction of the Intelligible order, with no question of an anthro- pomorphic creator of all" (Wallis 1972:102). Christians who came under the influence of Neoplatonic thought, however, sometimes worked out some interesting accomodations between Christian teachings and Neoplatonism, incorporating, in one fashion or an- other, the God of revelation, angels, and souls into Neoplatonic spiritual hierarchies. Of great importance to our inquiry into the development of the category supernatural are two men touched by Neoplatonic thought: Proclus (d. 485), a pagan and head of the School of Athens; and Pseudo-Dionysius (c. 500), an apparent Christian. They were influential in promoting the tradition of describing spiritual beings (God, angels, and human souls) with terms that suggest certain senses of what we generally take to be implied by "supernatural." Proclus spoke of a superior life of souls, and he said that souls are, by essence, "huperphueis" ('of superior nature') and "huperkosmioi" ('supermundane') (de Lubac 1934:226). And Pseudo-Dionysuis employed a set of words compounded with hupe'r through which he suggested the transcendence of spiritual beings- including the term "huperoutsios," 'superior being' or 'superior substance' (de Lubac 1934:228). When various works of Pseudo-Dionysius were translated into Latin in the ninth century (by Hilduin and John Scotus Erigena), supernatural, as Kenny (1972:94) puts it, "made its debut" in the theology of Western Christendom. The Latin term supernaturalis was given the Neoplatonic sense of superior substance, and it was subsequently applied with that meaning. Scotus Erigena called God a supernatural nature (de Lubac 1934:228), Mary was in- voked as "Regina supernaturalis" (Kenny 1972:94), and Saint Al- bert the Great designated angels 'supernatural substances' (de Lubac 1934:229).</page><page sequence="17">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 47 Saint Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) employed supernatural in its Neoplatonic acceptation of superior being or substance (de Lubac 1934:229, Kenny 1967:812, 1972:95). He also, however, applied supernatural to surpassing effects (Kenny 1967:812), and it was out of this usage that a technical theology of the supernatural emerged. Saint Thomas's theology and speculative philosophy sum to something of a middle way between the naturalism of the pagan Greek philosophers and the voluntarism of Saint Augustine (Kenny 1967:813). In the Thomist system, nature is created and God is its first cause. Unlike Aristotle's Unmoved Mover, God acts through free will, not inexorable necessity. Moreover, he endows created natures with their own internal necessities, so that they function as stable or abiding principles of activity (Kenny 1967:813), thus giving to nature, the totality of created natures, a more emphatic integrity than is allowed for in the Augustinian system. The intrinsic neces- sities of created natures render creatures second causes of motion, true causes producing effects though ultimately dependent on God (for all existents in creation are effects of God and they continu- ously receive their existence from him for so long as they may exist). God, however, may sometimes intervene in special ways. Gilson puts it succinctly: "Since Nature does not proceed from God by way of a necessary emanation, but by an act of His free will, He can always produce the effects of second causes without the help of the second causes themselves, or even other effects that lie beyond the power of these causes" (1940:377). The intervention of God without the instrumentality of second causes, and the surpassing effects occasioned by his transcendence of the powers of second causes, neither compromise the stability of created natures nor contradict their functions as true causes. Rather, they complement them and are rationally consistent with them since both the intrinsic necessities of created natures and miraculous interventions proceed from God and are grounded in his foresight. Saint Thomas's important contribution to the emergence of a technical theology of the supernatural represents a special develop- ment of the concept of surpassing effects. Saint Thomas and others of the Scholastics have left us as one of their legacies a dichotomy between the natural and the supernatural that is theologically</page><page sequence="18">48 * ETHOS rooted in a distinction between the Order of Nature and the Order of Grace. Basic and central to that tradition is the idea of God's freely of- fered gift of himself to man through the redemptive mission of Jesus Christ. As an act of grace it even surpasses the creation of the world. It is a gratuity added to man's created natural faculties, and it enables man to establish a new relationship with his creator, a relationship of adoptive sonship. Man is thus elevated far above his natural endowment: No being can act beyond the limits of its specific nature, since the cause must always be of a higher potency than its effect. Now the gift of grace surpasses every capacity of created nature, since it is nothing other than a certain participation7 in the divine nature, which surpasses every other nature. And so it is impossible that a creature should cause grace... so it is necessary that God alone should make godlike (solus Deus deificet), by communicating a share in his divine nature by par- ticipation and assimilation (Saint Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, la2ae. 112, 1). It is this giving of God to man that is most specifically and most emphatically "supernatural." Any other gifts (e.g., "preternatural gifts"-see Kenny 1972:5) are inferior to it. In post-Scholastic times supernatural has had a checkered theo- logical career. In Roman Catholicism the first pope to adopt the word supernatural officially was Pius V in 1567, and it was not until Vatican I in 1870 that the term was embodied in a councilar decree (Kenny 1967:812). In recent years it has figured in theologi- cal controversies initiated by attacks on Scholasticism launched by theorists holding evolutionary, phenomenological, and existentialist points of view. In Protestant circles the term has at various times attained im- portance. When the rationalist proponents of a "natural theology" attacked orthodox theology in the eighteenth century, the defenders of the traditional view that the nature of God differs fundamen- tally from that of creation eventually became known as "super- 7. 'Participation' (participatio), an important concept in Aquinas, has a long pedigree in Western civilization. Plato speaks of particulars participating in ideal forms, and Neoplatonists (especially Iamblichus) develop charac- teristically convoluted understandings for it. Participation lives on in the Scholastics and well beyond them. We anthropologists meet it in Levy-Bruhl's participation mystique.</page><page sequence="19">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 49 naturalists." A new corps of "supernaturalists" later sprang up when a new rationalism developed out of the writings of Kant) Hegel, and Schleiermacher. There has been a propensity among Protestant theologians (as among some Catholic theologians relatively distant to the Scholas- tic tradition) to extend the term supernatural to the human soul and even the human "personality." Thus, for example, Horace Bushnell, a nineteenth-century American Protestant, declares that the supernatural "meets us in what is least transcendent and most familiar, even in ourselves ... The very idea of our personality is that of a being not under the law of cause and effect, a being supernatural" (1910 [1858]:31). While this statement amounts to a considerable departure from Scholastic theology, Bushnell's dis- cussion of Christianity constitutes less of a divergence. Christianity, Bushnell writes, is "supernatural" because "it acts regeneratively and new-creatively to repair the damage" that the laws of nature, "in their penal action, would otherwise perpetuate." Christianity is "a redemptive agency ... to reverse and restore the lapsed condi- tion of sinners" (1910:30). This viewpoint suggests a continuity with Saint Thomas's thesis that the gift of grace effects man's rebirth and re-creation (Summa Theologiae la2ae. 110, 4). In popular as distinct from theological circles supernatural is very broadly extended indeed. It has come to embrace all things and events that are represented to be superior substances or sur- passing effects: a jumble that includes God, angels, miracles, prodigies, powers marshaled by arcane rites and spells, and, for the gourmandizing imagination, a groaning smorgasbord of preter- natural items that may heat or chill the blood. It is this folk usage of supernatural rather than the more refined usages of theologians that we are likely to encounter among anthropologists. V We have it on the authority of Hallowell and various other ethnographers that a natural-supernatural dichotomy is not salient in the collective representations of some peoples. And Cohn (1964: 128) reminds us that while we cannot legitimately assert that the concept supernatural does not exist in cultures other than our own, we have no a priori reason to suppose that it does. The ques- tion then arises as to what use, if any, we might make of super- natural in anthropology. In particular, should we employ it in ex-</page><page sequence="20">50 * ETHOS ploring and describing non-Western world views, and ought we to use it in formulating some general definition of religion? "Although beliefs of any sort may be legitimately explained in categories foreign to the subjects themselves," Runciman writes, "they can only be identified in the subjects' own terms" (1969:150). This is why, he adds, it is poor procedure for the observer to im- pose descriptive terms that are not "directly derived from his doc- umentary evidence or fieldwork." This is true enough, insofar as it goes. There are, however, some additional considerations that might be taken into account. The data that anthropologists use are not freely and purely pre- sented to us by nature. We are selective in what we attend to, and our observations are themselves low-level interpretations, informed by some theoretical interest or bias. Apropos of this, it is well worth remembering that when we explore non-Western world views our own categories do not simply go away. The ethnographer's mind, though possibly boggled by the field situation, is rarely if ever blown clean by it. And since our thinking is inescapably compara- tivist, we inevitably make use of our own categories in attending to those of the natives. Since that is so, then perhaps we ought to do something more positive and public about it. I suggest that we routinely attempt to increase our understand- ings of native categories by consciously and deliberately comparing and contrasting them to our own, and that we publicize having done so in our professional reports. In our field explorations the natural-supernatural dichotomy can be and should be invoked in some well considered sense. Doing so is likely to deepen our under- standing of other world views if only by highlighting possible con- trasts in collective representations. I am certain that this proved to be the case for Professor Hallowell. The question now arises as to which understanding of our West- ern natural-supernatural dichotomy we might best employ in our field research. The technical Christian distinction between the Order of Grace and the Order of Nature is decidedly too narrow and theologically specific to prove of much use. And while Durk- heim's treatment of nature is unexceptional, his sense of the "mysterious" is too broad and vague, and his notion of the "im- possible" would prove to be disturbingly paradoxical were we to attempt to apply it consistently. My preference is to base the</page><page sequence="21">SUPERNATURAL AS A WESTERN CATEGORY * 51 dichotomy on a well-considered antithesis between immanence and transcendence. We in the West generally assume that nature operates in accordance with certain principles or laws that are immanent in it. Assuming confidence in our understanding of those principles or laws-an assumption that I make for the pur- poses of argument-we may further suppose that any posited inter- ference with them or departure from them would suggest the operation of principles or forces that transcend nature. This, in- deed, is Durkheim's position also, once we shear it of certain over- statements. The supernatural, then, is our culture-bound category for anything that transcends the immanently principled operations of nature "as we understand them." In describing non-Western world views to Western audiences, we ought to employ our natural-supernatural opposition only when we can demonstrate that the natives make use of a similar opposi- tion or when we explicitly desire to point out that they do not. I think that it is misleading to refer to beings or powers in non- Western world views as "supernatural" when supernatural is not salient in native thought and we neglect to establish that point for our audience. In various of his papers Hallowell speaks of "other- than-human" rather than "supernatural" beings or entities in the conceptual system of the Northern Ojibwa, in a responsible ap- proximation to Ojibwa categorizations. We would do well to emu- late him in our own ethnographic presentations. The problems that arise in employing "supernatural" in highly abstract and general definitions of "religion" are complex and cannot be dealt with here. I do wish to point out, however, that more than a few anthropologists seem to rest their definitions of "religion" on "beliefs" in "supernatural" beings or powers, and they often do so without saying very much about what they under- stand by either "beliefs" or "supernatural." That, I think, is doubly regrettable. Despite the attentions rendered it by powerful minds, from Saint Augustine through H. H. Price, belief remains one of the most intractable problems in philosophy (for discussions of various aspects of that problem as they relate to anthropological concerns, see Hahn 1973, Needham 1972, and Saler 1967, 1972, 1973, 1974). And supernatural, as this brief paper indicates, is itself a category of some complexity and subtlety.</page><page sequence="22">* ETHOS REFERENCES AQUINAS, SAINT THOMAS. 1964. Summa Theologiae.
