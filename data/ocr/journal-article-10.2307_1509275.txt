For many philosophers Anselm's proofs for the existence of God are hardly more than curious examples of misapplied logic. And in the hands of many theologians his interpretation of the atoning work of the Christ is useful only as a less favorable comparison with certain modern theories.

Frequently the Scottish philosopher Hume is called upon to support such criticism in terms of his famous distinction between truths derived from the relations between ideas, and empirical matters of fact and existence. In particular, every beginning student in the phil- osophy of religion is taught to point out in Anselm the instructive mistakes of supposing that one can somehow identify revealed and rational theologies, or of supposing that from a mere idea of God one can get to the actual existence of God. For, they are taught, it is one thing to etc., etc., but it is quite another thing to etc., etc.4 However, one need not have a depraved mind to recognize that Anselm cannot justifiably be treated as more foolish than the classic fool who says in his heart there is no God. Indeed, there are even some, like Hartshorne and Malcolm, who in our time offer plausible cases in behalf of the saint, and in general I support their efforts. Unfortunately, contemporary philosophers have done more to elucidate the logic of "the ontological argument" than they have to explicate the force of Anselm's own arguments. While the preference is a legitimate philosophical concern, some over- sights occur in the process. For example, one is tempted to overlook the range of thought peculiar to Anselm, and, conse- quently, the arguments which he thought suitable to his purposes. What is more to the point here, preoccupation with the validity or invalidity of an ontological proof may result in failure to note other important philosophical problems in Anselm. My concern in what follows is with one such problem, alluded to but not adequately answered by Malcolm at the end of his essay on Anselm: What is the relation of Anselm's ontological argument to religious belief? This is a difficult question. . ... Surely there is a level at which one can view the argument as a piece of logic, following the deductive moves but not being touched religiously? I think so. But even at this level the argument may not be without religious value, 'Op. cit., Proslogion, 117. Anselm himself makes a significantly different dis- tinction: "For it is one thing for an object to exist in the mind, and another thing to understand that an object actually exists." (Aliud enim est rem esse in intellectu, aliud intelligere rem esse.)</page><page sequence="3">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 151 for it may help to remove some philosophical scruples that stand in the way of faith.5 While Malcolm's discussion suffers from lack of precise state- ment, it may be possible to reconstruct his position. Malcolm suggests, implies, and suspects (respectively) the following views: 6 (i) It is quite possible for an atheist (the "fool" of the Psalm) to be convinced of the validity of Anselm's argument, yet remain an atheist; to recognize with Anselm how meaningless it is to say in one's heart "There is no God," yet have no "living faith." (2) The argument functions (presumably, at least in some cases) to make faith in God philosophically acceptable. (3) Only one who already is disposed to faith in God can fully appreciate Anselm's position; thorough understanding comes only to one who, because he views the idea of an infinitely great being "from the inside, not just from the outside," already possesses some inclina- tion which is not an effect of understanding the argument, but is rather a presupposition of the understanding of it. In what follows I wish to examine Malcolm's question and his answers to it. I do not necessarily subscribe to Anselm's position, but, at the same time, I do want to indicate what sense it makes to hold the position. With Malcolm's question in mind, in the first section I argue that Malcolm's views in (i) and (2) are not apropos of Anselm. In the second section I examine some terms which are crucial to Anselm's arguments, terms whose proper use make Malcolm's view in (3) questionable. My in- terpretation of Anselmian "proof" in the third section offers an application of preceding conclusions. Finally, in section four, I note some legitimate difficulties and some fruitful implications of the relation between Anselm's effort and religious belief.

Of course, it may be that Anselm wishes precisely to exhibit the foolishness in this inconsistency of thought and action. Indeed, I want to suggest that for Anselm it is absurd for one to accept the proof but reject faith in God. In this respect Malcolm would be better off arguing that atheism is a viable position not because it is compatible with justifiable belief in God, but because the proof is unconvincing. Let me offer the following context. Anselm almost always operates in what has come to be known as the rationalist tradition. To do so entails on his part a certain way of arguing and a certain way of construing reality. First of all, Anselm nearly always argues ad impossibile.7 Typically he attempts to state the premises of an argument so that it is intuitively impossible to draw more than one conclusion; any other suggested conclusion is presumed to be undesirable, if not unreasonable. With the exception of one, all of the initially logical possibilities turn out to be unworthy of the rational man, if not implausible for him. That is, one is capable of entertaining, but not finally concluding in favor of, the possibility of poly- theism, for example. In the absence of more persuasive reasons it is somehow more fitting, more primitively reasonable, to have theism. Hence Anselm's reasoning depends on a certain intuitive elegance, and that is important to note. For one thing, he argues more in a Socratic manner than in a manner susceptible to Aristotelian syllogistic. To follow his reasoning it is unnecessary for the reader to have formal training in logic or in rhetoric. Anselm assumes that any reader realizes when a conclusion does or does not follow from preceding con- siderations, and no reader needs to be taught what it means for something to follow from something else. One instinctively makes the right move. Therefore, perhaps the discomfort which the present-day reader feels from time to time about Anselmic moves is not due to their illogicality but to their uncompromising simplicity. One 7Proslogion, 121-33, includes a series of arguments designed to show that God must be "whatever it is better to be than not to be."</page><page sequence="5">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 153 gets the distinct feeling that one has given assent to too much. Clearly the economy of terms in Anselm's claims does hide am- biguities which, in the absence of clarification, make one hesitant about giving full assent. Yet, to Anselm there is no such thing as partial assent. If a conclusion follows at all, it requires un- hesitating assent, because rational intuition, not feeling, is the ground of superior judgment and of knowledge of which we can be certain (cf. Ch. IV, Proslogion). For another thing, Anselm is sufficiently faithful to the Au- gustinian tradition so as to disclaim any credit for having improved upon the metaphysics of that famous Bishop of Hippo.8 Anselm most frequently uses terms like being, possibility, actual- ity, and even God, in a neoplatonic way of conceiving reality. Consequently Anselm should not be expected to speak directly to issues which interest positivists or existentialists of our time. Ironically, the positions of certain Anselmian critics today probably would not have qualified as rational enterprises, in Anselm's sense of rationality. At any rate, it is important for students of Anselm to distinguish between what Anselm may have had in mind and what it would take to make a position like Anselm's valid. Finally, even when one discusses the nature of the religious consciousness, it is important to remember the Anselmian pen- chant for rationality. While his language is misleading at times, it never seriously suggests the structures familiar to mysticism or to religious faith as they are known to post-Reformation or contemporary theologies. Whatever credo ut intelligam or fides quaerens intellectum mean, they do not require a sacrifice of reason in favor of ineffable feeling or of noncognitive trust. It is commonly but unjustifiably supposed that belief (or faith) according to Anselm implies that a rational nonbeliever cannot know God. On that supposition, entertained by the impatiently pious, it is ridiculously easy to explain why so many of Anselm's critics over the centuries have found it impossible to agree that he has established the existence of God. However, ex hypothesi, it is much more difficult to explain why believers disagree! As for (2) above, Malcolm's claim that Anselm's argument 8 Cf. op. cit., Monologium (Deane Edition), Preface, 36.</page><page sequence="6">154 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW functions to make faith in God philosophically respectable, the question is to whom the argument becomes an aid in the removal of philosophical scruples. If we rule out Malcolm's atheist, then there are at least two other classes: the class of those who require (and who seek?) sound arguments without which they will not believe, and the class of those who do not. The range of the first class might include those who are satisfied as a result of the removal of specific doubts, and those who seek but never believe because they always have some doubt. Likewise, distinctions among the class of those who do not require sound arguments may range from those who are satisfied with unsound arguments to those who regard mere faith as sufficient. The distinctions indicate a variety of possible relations between sufficient reason and faith. By implying that Anselm's argument has different functions, Malcolm overlooks the complexity of the problem of settling religious disputes. The oversight results from failure to attempt an answer to the question, "For whom did Anselm write?" That the onto- logical argument may function in a variety of ways, legitimately or illegitimately, I do not challenge here. However, I will argue that, for Anselm, the believer is willing, the unbeliever is un- willing, to entertain the proof seriously. Hence, it is appropriate to say that Anselm's argument has a single design, serving both believer and unbeliever. For Anselm the difference between them is not one of the presence or absence of cognitive or emotive material, but rather one of degree of willingness to understand. I suggest that Anselm addresses himself to the rational man, the man who assumes that thoughtfulness and reality coincide in man's worthiest aspirations.9 On the one hand Anselm addresses the conscientious but im- mature member of the church who, in wonder and near incredulity over the principal message of Christianity, asks how it is possible that there is a God who forgives sin, promises eternal life, and balances the moral budget of the world. Anselm could respond in pastoral fashion by underscoring the mystery and miracle of it all. But he does not. On the contrary, he proceeds to show how it is possible, indeed how rationally impossible it is for it to "Ibid., Ch. I, 37; Proslogion (Charlesworth Edition), I9g.</page><page sequence="7">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 155 be otherwise. His message to the religious man is one not of hope but of good sense and of certainty that God is. To Anselm the possibility that God cannot be known in the same way as other features of reality are known is an inconsistency. There is a sense in which if God is not known, then neither is anything else for sure. Or perhaps, in case nothing else is certain, the existence of God is.o" On the other hand Anselm addresses "the fool" who supposes that he is the most sensible, the most rational for doubting that there is a god. Anselm does not admonish this famous fool from within the peculiar sanctity of the pulpit or by reliance on a particular theological dogma. He does not need such an argu- mentum ad verecundiam. On the contrary, he meets the unbe- liever at the very citadel of his doubt, challenging and provoking the fool's own propensity for good sense, and arguing that he, the doubter, cannot be rational and still be an unbeliever. The two are incompatible, which is to say that the doubter, so long as he remains a doubter, whether deliberately or not, is irrational. Hence, the true predicament common to both religious en- thusiast and doubter alike is a lack of thoughtfulness. The only question that Anselm requires both to answer is whether or not they choose to be rational about reality. Of course, one can refuse to be consistent. One can be quite rational about some things, yet imply that something else is applicable when it comes to God and to religion. For example, an existentialist may be so struck by the surds he discovers in moral situations or by those pervasive hitches in the machinery of the world that he chooses to give prime consideration to the paradoxical character of things. But while he may wish to probe for chinks in Anselm's metaphysical armor, he cannot seriously take issue with the ef- fort to make good sense. The existentialist, whatever else he claims, does not normally wish to be regarded as an irrationalist. Like his sometime enemy, the objective empiricist, the existentia- list gives priority to a kind of existence different from that of the rationalist. Thus, contrary to Anselm, he underscores the fact that I suffer, or that I anguish, or that I die. Again, if the o Ibid. "In fact, everything else there is, except You alone, can be thought of as not existing."</page><page sequence="8">156 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW empiricist is more concerned about how we verify such facts, in an effort to gain objective meaning, Anselm argues for a kind of reality that a thoughtful man can establish in the privacy of his reflection. Anselm shares the scepticism of all rationalists concerning the usefulness of empirical fact for dependable knowledge. If that is the case, then rather than to speak exclusively either to the believer or to the doubter Anselm has the audacity to feature a single structure of reality and good sense. He makes little use of certain favorite distinctions between the scientific realm and the theological realm, or between truth and The Truth, or between subjectivity and objectivity. He has no good reason for such initial assumptions. He allows his own best thinking to describe what there really is. He assumes that there is a difference between knowledge and opinion, between what is rationally real and what is apparent to the person who opens his eyes and ears. He sees no need to distinguish between the settlement of disputes which go on at various levels between religious and nonreligious people. Whether Anselm speaks to the atheist or to the man of some religious persuasion other than his own, it makes no essential difference. The problem for one and all is to achieve rationality. At worst Anselm is ambiguous and misleading. It is improper to say that he is wrong unless one clarifies the principal senses which operate implicitly and at odds with one another in his work. As I hope to show, clarification and interpretation based on considerations like the preceding enable one to understand how Anselm may be misunderstood and why his critics frequently are barking up the wrong tree. Accordingly one must clarify Anselm's perspective and language before one can decide whether work of this sort is in principle related to religious belief. II Anselm's Proslogion takes the form of a meditation more ele- gant than Augustine's Confessions and more worshipful than Descartes' Meditations. Like these classics, Anselm's writing is something for which he holds himself personally responsible;</page><page sequence="9">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 157 unlike them, it is not nearly so autobiographical. For sheer beauty of style it is difficult to surpass, and one is tempted to conclude that if reality is not as Anselm describes it, so much the worse for reality. But beauty is also susceptible to vague description. The first difficulty arises when Anselm states in his Preface that he has written "the following short tract dealing with this question . . . from the point of view of one trying to raise his mind to contemplate God and seeking to understand what he believes." Does Anselm beg the question in some sense? The temptation is to try to decide whether belief is something signifi- cantly independent of understanding, or whether understanding depends in some sense on belief. Frequently the problem is construed as one of determining how Anselm treats the relation between faith and understanding. However, I want to suggest, the probability is that the problem is misconstrued. According to the last of Malcolm's views, (3) above, he argues that only the "insider" (the one who already believes, or who is disposed to believe) fully appreciates Anselm's argument. Whether understanding the argument cannot or need not effect religious belief is not clear. Apparently in the case of Malcolm's atheist it cannot; but in the case of the one with philosophical scruples it can, at least in one sense of "understanding." Malcolm suggests that thorough understanding (perhaps another sense of the term) presupposes emotional inclination. Of course, if that is so, then it is no wonder that so many students of Anselm con- clude that the argument is unsatisfactory as a basis for religious belief: they are without the inclination, and religious belief is a matter of psychological curiosity. I suggest, rather, that for Anselm the concepts of "belief" and of "understanding" are suitable categories on the basis of which to conclude that God exists, but that Malcolm fails to note seriously their ambiguities. Accordingly I suggest that any "thorough" understanding of Anselm's argument rests not on a prior possession of an inclina- tion, but on a simple intuitive capacity to discern the difference between what (logically) follows and what does not follow. Actually, Anselm's choice of terminology contributes most to " Ibid., I03.</page><page sequence="10">158 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW the questionable view that he means to qualify the rational pro- cedure with an arational conditio sine qua non. Belief (or faith) is just one of a number of crucially ambiguous terms in his vocabulary.12 Against a background of revealed theology, as it is understood today, it is tempting to interpret the term as designating some- thing cognitive yet qualitatively different from natural under- standing. In that case, belief, in the phrase "seeking to under- stand what he believes," would indicate a peculiar kind of information that, according to the biblical suggestion, never occurred to the natural heart or head of any man. As a con- sequence, if this revealed information has divine origin, Anselm's problem is not to understand it himself (since it is revealed), nor does he need to explain it to others who already possess it. Yet, ex hypothesi, it is impossible to explain it and to communicate it to those who are without such revelation. Thus, those students of Anselm who interpret him to mean that justification for being religious comes only after faith that there is a God must explain first what such faith cognitively amounts to. (Malcolm, after Kierkegaard, suggests some kind of "inclination" which stems "from the emotions.") In an effort to win a battle (but perhaps lose the war) their recourse is to suggest that belief cannot be understood in conventional ways; it is self-evident, perhaps, to the one who experiences it. Anselm, they continue, must be under- stood as seeking to understand in some sense what he already understands in some other sense. The trouble is that this view, if true, not only makes it ridicu- lously simple to discredit the alleged "proof" that Anselm offers (now that proof, in the absence of understanding, has no mean- ingful function). In addition, the view also gives Anselm no good reason to write the Proslogion, since it cannot be meaningful except to the believer - who does not need it. Why did Anselm write the Proslogion? That is, what more satisfactory account of Anselm's work may be offered so as to attribute some good purpose to his proof? Anselm's view of revelation exhibits no similarity to typical present-day doctrines. But suppose that faith, for Anselm's SIbid., 117, quoted below, on p. i6o.</page><page sequence="11">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 159 purposes, is regarded as belief in something conceivably credit- able but not rationally explicit. Then a kind of revelation via lumen naturale is what Anselm may have in mind. Typically, one might say, one's first glimmer of God's existence comes in the form of an opinion, a belief which is neither true nor false to one's satisfaction. Frequently one is referred, for the authority for this belief, to the book of the church, the Bible. Of course, if Anselm regarded the Scriptures as a holy and inspired set of writings, he need not have regarded their meaning as sufficiently clear or self-evidently true to warrant assent from the rational man. Like Augustine he could have supposed that one can never be sure what a scriptural writer finds sufficient to credit the existence of God until one comes to his own understanding in- dependent of the matter of scriptural language.'3 The scriptural writer does not acquaint the inquiring reader with the reasoning through which the writer went; and Anselm indicates no peculiar experience, no face-to-face confrontation with the object (God) of the writer's words. In short, while one can read what others have said about God, one may continue to wonder whether it is true, until such time as conditions for a reasonable decision are met. In the absence of personal assent the claims may be interesting, curious, even significant - if true. But how is it possible to arrive with cer- tainty, not opinion, at the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? One way is to entertain or suppose the possibility of God and then "see" what it would take to make the possibility fit experi- ence. The supposition (that God exists) is not enough. In Anselm's case, what it would take to make the possibility true is crucial, because the test is not an empirical but a rational one. For Anselm belief (credimus) is the first condition of ordinary rationality. Belief precedes understanding in the sense that one cannot have a rational notion of something without at least entertaining the possibility of its reality. But belief in the reality of x begs a specification of x, and the reality or existence of x is rationally determined by the implications which follow from the specification. In a sense, understanding just requires "3Saint AUGUSTINE: Basic Writings, ed. Whitney Oates (New York: Random House, 1948), in the Confessions, Bk. XII, Ch. XXV.</page><page sequence="12">160 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW belief, and the two are logically if not psychologically related. However, mere belief is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for understanding. There is an intuitive gap between belief and understanding such that an explication of the former, or an inspection of the (unspecified) term God, is not sufficient to elicit the latter. A subtly corroborative passage comes at the beginning of Chapter II of the Proslogion where Anselm prays that his under- standing may be correct. Well then, Lord, You who give understanding to faith [fidei intel- lectum], grant me that I may understand, as much as You see fit, that You exist as we believe [credimus] You to exist, and that You are what we believe You to be.14 Notice, first of all, that the object of belief, not so far specified by Anselm, elicits from the believer an effort to understand the specification of and "correspondence" with the object. Anselm need not presuppose the possession of unique cognitive or emotive material. Secondly, if belief were a noncommunicable realization or recognition of God's existence in some sense (as in revealed the- ology), then we could expect the believer to be capable of detect- ing and correcting false explanations of what he privately knows. Yet, not only does Anselm suggest the possibility that his explana- tion (forthcoming) may be false (since God may not deem it profitable for him to understand accurately); he also infers that he cannot presently imagine what it would be like to realize that he is wrong (since, one might argue, it is possible that what is fit for man to understand is known only to God). Thus, only if belief is defined as a rational enterprise, a supposition whose entailments are either plausible or not, can Anselm possibly entertain such caution. Therefore, his position implies that either reason is suf- ficient (and if so, he is correct) or it is not (and if so, there is no way of knowing God for sure). Briefly, Anselm intimates that there is no possible way of somehow knowing that God exists if one does not know how or why. Like Descartes in the Meditations, the possibility of error is 14 Op. cit., Ch. II, II7.</page><page sequence="13">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 161 ruled out if God is to be known at all; if God is unknowable, nothing is certain, because the very principle of rationality is at stake. At best Anselm can be wrong only because some other proof is more elegant. And that in a nutshell is the creed of every rationalist. How does Anselm specify the object of his belief? What is it that one entertains or supposes when he supposes "God"? Now we believe that You are something than which nothing greater can be thought. Or can it be that a thing of such a nature does not exist, since "the Fool has said in his heart, there is no God" [Ps. xiii. I, lii. I]? But surely, when this same Fool hears what I am speaking about, namely, "something-than-which-nothing-greater-can- be-thought," he understands what he hears, and what he understands is in his mind, even if he does not understand that it actually exists.15 Anselm's discovery is that the intuitive gap between belief and understanding is breached if God is specified as a something than which, etc. Belief has two parts, supposition and specification, which together are necessary and sufficient conditions for under- standing. Again, the reference to the "fool" confirms what has been said about the meaning of faith to Anselm. Suppose you say, "faith precedes understanding," and that is the reason that the Fool is foolish, namely, because he does not have faith. Then you have two choices: either faith means new information, and lack of it means the fool is ignorant; or faith means a state of reflection short of understanding, and the fool is simply unreflective, not fully rational, whether he intends to be or not. But if the fool lacks information, he is hardly a fool; he cannot be blamed for sheer ignorance over which he has no control. Anselm even distinguishes between the fool's ability to compre- hend familiar language and his (the fool's) ability to agree that what he comprehends is true of reality.'" He insists that it is not sufficient to entertain the mere possibility of the existence of God, that is, to "understand" what one hears, in a sense that is com- parable to having something "in" one's understanding. To under- stand that God exists requires reflection of the sort that the fool 1Ibid., "nothing greater can be thought" (maius cogitari non potest). l Ibid.</page><page sequence="14">162 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW is either unwilling or unable to carry out. Rather, let me suggest, the fool is like a painter who is satisfied to entertain but never to carry out on canvas the suggestion he gets. The fool is no more rational than the painter is a painter.17 Thus, in addition to faith, the term understanding (or its rough synonym conception) is ambiguous in Anselm's terminology. In one sense one can understand or conceive something, such as the language of the Scriptures, and so call attention to one activity of the mind.18 Yet, in another sense of the term one can fail to understand why the language must be true of reality. The ques- tion is whether there really is a god corresponding to what is understood, in this second sense. Anselm himself adds to the confusion by his example of the painter who typically entertains an idea which he eventually realizes on canvas.19 The example is misleading because one is tempted to use it as a paradigm for what it takes to establish the existence of the "mental" objects one entertains - just as one is tempted to suppose that Descartes' problem is to satisfy the correspondence of ideas with actual objects. However, it is unlikely that Anselm wants to suggest that knowledge of God presents us with a problem similar to the problem of the painter's realization of his idea on canvas, as if one must somehow get from the notion in one's head to its counter- part in perceptually public actuality. Suppose that God, some- thing-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought, is not a vis- ualization derived from experience. Then God is not an entity that can be entertained, let alone be understood to exist, in the form of an image in advance of actual confrontation with the object. Once again, the term being, roughly synonymous with existence in Anselm's vocabulary, is ambiguous, and sometimes it refers to "~ Ibid. See footnote 19. 18 Moreover, if I am right, ANSELM holds that it is unnecessary for one to be in possession of mental images in order for the phrase "that than which nothing greater can be thought" to be meaningful. See below. 1 Ibid. "Thus, when a painter plans beforehand what he is going to execute, he has the picture in his mind, but he does not yet think that it actually exists because he has not yet executed it. However, when he has actually painted it, then he both has it in his mind and understands that it exists because he has now made it."</page><page sequence="15">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 163 some thing, sometimes it refers to reality itself. I wish to suggest that God, for Anselm, is not a being (thing) among other beings; rather, God is the determinative principle of all being, and a way of construing reality itself. Moreover, the example of the painter is not designed to be an "inner-outer" model for idea-actuality or mentality-reality. The example functions better to picture the problem, suggested toward the end of the third section of this paper, of creative fulfillment of the principle of God, which prob- lem confronts the rational man who contemplates God's existence. To put it crudely, one need not leave one's mind to arrive at reality. To Anselm it is probably a mistake to take seriously spatial relations like in or beyond except in the context of the ordinary language of the man on the street. Serious theological or philosophical reflection about reality requires a more sophisti- cated terminology. To proceed as though the problem were to get from my head to something outside my head is already to beg the issue in favor of a certain model of existence and a certain view of truth. The important distinction for Anselm is between a candidate for being (reality, existence) and bona fide being. If one allows Anselm's example of the painter to be paradig- matic, then the inner-outer model prevails, and terms such as conception, existence, faith, understanding, and even God beg the problem of materializing an idea. On that assumption follow many of the familiar difficulties and criticisms which are a tradi- tional part of the mind-body problem. If Anselm seems to speak that way, he cannot really mean it. Perhaps one can account most charitably for the ambiguity of Anselm's language and the mis- leading character of his example by crediting him also with the assumption that his readers would recognize his preference for an Augustinian metaphysics. Yet, even Gaunilo, Anselm's con- temporary critic, may have been misled by the inner-outer model, despite Anselm's feeble efforts to pinpoint that misunderstanding for him.20 One more crucial ambiguity. Anselm's famous specification of divine existence reads "something-than-which-nothing-greater-can- be-thought." The term greater is especially difficult for moderns because Anselm, like Plato and Augustine before him, generally I Op. cit., ANSELM's reply to GAUNILO, 169-91.</page><page sequence="16">164 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW assumed that something that is logically or rationally superior (something on which something else is logically dependent) has a relatively higher value in the scheme of all good things. Hence, when Anselm says later that, for example, God is omnipotent, compassionate, passionless, living, wise, good, blessed, eternal, and "whatever it is better to be than not to be," the character of a principle is suggested.21 Perhaps Anselm holds that if the relation of elements without which a thing would not be what it is (that is, its essence) is noncontradictory, then there is sufficient reason for the existence of those elements. Then, too, God is whatever there is sufficient reason for God to be, whatever it is better to be, and that than which nothing greater can be conceived. What makes Anselm so sure that there is sufficient reason for God's existence? Because God is that (entertainable) being by comparison with which nothing is rationally superior. III For Anselm rational reality is supreme, and one must not con- ceive of God in terms that are tied to familiar experience, for to do so is to proceed in the wrong direction, toward the inner- outer model. One cannot immediately visualize an entity whose sole defining trait, if that is what the formula is, is a something- than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-thought. Moreover, Anselm offers no examples such as Augustine does, for instance, when the latter finally arrives at Absolute Truth as the sole instance of the most excellent of things and so calls this God.22 Anselm does not require that one make a mental selection from among the many things with which memory is familiar; nor does he begin with an anthropomorphic image derived from scriptural descriptions. On the contrary, for Anselm the God-phrase functions as a formal principle, one that requires an open-mindedness limited only by the ultimate in human rationality. The terms for God make something like a rule, the principal rule by which every philosophical or theological discussion about reality is to be m Op. cit., Proslogion, Ch. XI, 133.

McKeon (Scribner's: New York, 1929).</page><page sequence="17">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 165 governed. It is as though in dialogue with interested parties one lays it down at the outset, in advance of any theorizing whatso- ever, that nothing will qualify for the title God that does not do full justice to reality. In a sense it would be proper for Anselm to call God the prin- ciple of reality, not as something which it is possible to imagine, but as an ever-present reminder that whatever we say about God must be guided by the concern to attribute the utmost rationality to reality. No doubt an additional reason so many students have misinterpreted or become discouraged with Anselm, therefore, is that they fail to recognize that "that-than-which-a-greater-can- not-be-thought" is not itself an immediately conceivable entity, like mermaid or unicorn. Anselm's principle functions more like a prescription than a universal, and it implies a readiness to let the greatest thing you can think of be God, given a consistent view of reality. Candi- dates for the position vary widely, no doubt, just as do the con- ceptions of God with which we are familiar in the history of religions. But the question of Anselm is whether or not all such conceptions figure adequately in the scheme of things. Thus, Anselm makes it appropriate to ask: with what should the rational man be satisfied? How adequate is this God? How does God figure into reality as we know it? What sort of God will it take to do the job we religiously require? For Anselm nothing less than utmost rational effort can bring God into play in reality. Why? The answer to this "why" is provided by Anselm in his so-called "proofs," or perhaps better, "rational explanations." The initial attempt at a proof is directed to the suggestion that the idea of God may be merely an idea. And surely that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought cannot exist in the mind alone. For if it exists solely in the mind even, it can be thought to exist in reality also, which is greater.23 But Anselm's rational approach cuts through the idea-actuality distinction. Existence "in the mind alone" corresponds to that ' Op. cit., Proslogion, I117. MALCOLM holds that this passage implies the doc- trine that existence is a perfection. On that basis he rejects ANSELM's initial at- tempt at proof. MALCOLM suggests that while it makes good sense to say that "my future house will be a better one if it is insulated than if it is not insulated,"</page><page sequence="18">166 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW state of mind that describes the Fool; existence "in reality" cor- responds to complete rational satisfaction. The latter is superior to the former at least in the sense that thoughtfulness is better than thoughtlessness. Moreover, Anselm says: If then that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought exists in the mind alone, this same that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought is that-than-which-a-greater-can-be-thought. But this is obviously impossible. Therefore there is absolutely no doubt that something- than-which-a-greater-cannot-be-thought exists both in the mind and in reality.24 In short, Anselm confronts the reader with the intuitive impossi- bility of supposing that "that-than-which-a-greater-cannot-be- thought" is "that-than-which-a-greater-can-be-thought." One can suppose, at one time, that a certain God exists; and one can sup- pose, at another time, that a certain God does not exist; but one cannot suppose, at one and the same time, contradictory principles. Moreover, an entity fashioned for supposition only does not qualify as the greatest conceivable being; conceivability is in- complete if it falls short of the rational effort to decide for or against reality. Reality is not spatially locatable either inside or outside the mind; it is whatever cannot possibly not be. As for God, or that being than which nothing greater is con- ceivably possible, Anselm says: And certainly this being so truly exists that it cannot be even thought not to exist. For something can be thought to exist that cannot be thought not to exist, and this is greater than that which can be thought not to exist.25 Suppose that someone does suppose that God's nonexistence is as conceivable as His existence, that the two possibilities are equally justifiable, and thus that nothing is proven. Then Anselm it is senseless to say that my future house will be better if it exists than if it does not (op. cit., I39). If MALCOLM had not begged the fact ("my future house"), it would not be senseless to talk about the difference between a plan and its realiza- tion. The simpler reading of ANSELM is preferable: the claim that, of things con- ceivable, those which, upon reflection, turn out to be real are more important (to a person who attempts to establish reality in this way) than those which turn out to be unreal. And as ANSELM says: "What can be more clear than this?" (Deane edition, op. cit., 157). 24 Ibid. 25 Ibid., i19.</page><page sequence="19">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 167 cuts through these suppositions by stating that while it is logically possible to conceive of both possibilities, in the sense of enter- taining at one time the existence of God and at another time the nonexistence of God, the requirements of rationality make it impossible to rest content with something less than the greatest conceivable being. Hence, it is not only that God is defined in a way that precludes His nonexistence; it is also that the rational man is not disposed to believe in chimeras. In short, whatever candidate is offered as a possible God could not be allowed, upon obstinate reflection, to be one who can be conceived not to exist. That brand of courage born of uncertainty about the existence of a god, for which some existentialists have become famous, is not for Anselm. Nor does he condone the tolerance we today afford the number and variety of gods who are represented by the religions of the world. Anselm's God is one who cannot be conceived not to exist, because it is the ground of being (to use familiar phrases), the ultimate in reality, the reason why there is something rather than nothing, in case there is any- thing real at all.26 Moreover, a rational mind could not conceive of a being better than Anselm's God without running the risk of imagining things, that is, without falling back into the idea-actuality model where nonexistence means that nothing "out there" corresponds with the image one entertains. For if some intelligence could think of something better than You, the creature would be above its creator and would judge its creator - and that is completely absurd. In fact, everything else there is, except You alone, can be thought of as not existing.27 Perhaps, too, it is appropriate to consider the theological posi- tion out of which Anselm operates. He assumes that theological reasoning would never knowingly eventuate in a God who is inferior to and dependent on the imagination of man. Like the painter in Anselm's earlier example, the problem of finding an 26 Cf. HARTSHORNE's article in the Plantinga anthology, op. cit., 134: ". . . since God is conceived as all-pervasive of actuality and possibility, if we do not know God as existent, it cannot be because we have been denied some requisite special experience, since either any experience is sufficient, or else none could possibly be." See also 128f. 7 Op. cit., I19.</page><page sequence="20">168 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW adequate description of God according to the rule laid down in the proof is something of a creative enterprise. But one must not ontologically confuse the object of description with the one who does the describing. In advance of any theologizing whatso- ever Anselm is prepared to say that God is the utmost that reality can offer. To the extent that reality is knowable, God is the great- est conceivable part of it; as the greatest conceivable part of reality, all rationality whatsoever is dependent upon God. Descartes makes it impossible to be a thoroughgoing sceptic, because all doubt whatsoever eventuates in the necessity to think sensibly even in one's efforts to form and state one's doubt. Anselm allows this necessity to figure so prominently in his med- itation that it grounds every thoughtful effort. We scarcely know what it would be like to be without root reasonableness. And God is the epitome, the principle of such reasonableness. For Anselm what truly exists need not be either mental or physical, but it must be reasonable. For anything else does not exist as truly, and so possesses existence to a lesser degree. Why then did "the Fool say in his heart, there is no God" [Ps. xiii. I, lii.I] when it is so evident to any rational mind that You of all things exist to the highest degree? Why indeed, unless because he was stupid and a fool? 28 IV What is religiously at stake in Anselm's so-called proofs for God's existence? The answer appears to be the same for fideist and atheist alike: a rational outlook. In some respects this single- mindedness of Anselm is good, while in other respects it is dubious. As nearly everyone recognizes, all believers surely do not feel the need for proofs in order to be religious. Yet, if that is so, then it is not because there are no available proofs but because most believers are satisfied with something else. The uncomfortable challenge of Anselm is that if one wants to be rational about it, then one cannot be satisfied with anything less than proof of the sort he offers. That is, if as a believer you really want to know how it is possible that there is a God who forgives sins, etc., 28 Ibid.</page><page sequence="21">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 169 then Anselm is prepared to offer you good reasons. If there is any doubt in your mind, Anselm offers a certain relief - relief in knowing that theology is a rationally creative enterprise, and that the believer is free, indeed encouraged, to give his dispositions a reasonable expression. It will not do to say that Anselm has short-circuited the very nature of faith, or that the nature of reli- gion is rather trust and wonder. To Anselm such objections really call attention to the unresolved difficulties of human reflection about God. The believer need not resolve such difficulties; if God exists, one's belief that He does is rewarded anyway to the degree that this belief about God's nature is true. But for Anselm the existence of God is not hypothetical and it is not a matter of conviction in the absence of knowledge. Obviously, if the question is about what it takes to be persuaded that there is a god, then one becomes clearer about the function of "proof." The term is used in various senses, some of which are roughly synonymous with persuasion and some of which are not. Anselm assumes that the proof he offers is sufficient to per- suade the rational man. He simply would not understand why some people can agree that a proof is valid yet choose not to give assent to its bearing on existence. Anselm does not, as we frequently do, distinguish between logical and material truth. There is only one kind of truth for him, and he reasons toward it at a more intuitive level than the rules for syllogistic logic and natural science provide. Of course, not every thoughtful person is persuaded by Anselm's reasoning. Disputes that arise among rival theologians are no less difficult to settle than disputes that take place between believers and nonbelievers.29 The principal reason for this is that parties to the dispute cannot always agree on what would be persuasive, and no doubt evidence will vary all the way from momentary feelings to the most hardnosed statistical results. When the nonbeliever challenges the believer's claim for God's existence by asking him to prove it, it is foolish for the believer to set out to prove something until first they agree on the conditions that have 29 For a more complete discussion of the nature of religious dispute see Scepti- cism and the Language of Dispute, in Discourse: A Review of the Liberal Arts (Fall, 1965).</page><page sequence="22">170 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW to be satisfied. What is, in our idiom, "proof enough" for one will not always do for another - and we frequently credit this fact as though every person had a right to his own degree of persuasion. In Anselm's case, proof is nothing less than the intuitively derived impossibility for some claim to be other than the person supposes. In the case of others, nothing less than an Elijah ex- perience serves to prove that God exists, whether applied to fellow believers as false prophets or to nonbelievers as doubters. Of course, Anselm would never agree that the Elijah affair is suf- ficient. It is always possible that the agent of the fire that sprang up at Elijah's command is natural, and that the event is coin- cidental. To Anselm experience is at best a second-rate confirma- tion of the existence and activity of God: blessed is he who believes without benefit of eyesight. In the absence of any experi- ence whatsoever (other than reflection) Anselm knows that God exists. Actually, when the believer calls attention to the existence of God, he calls into play his own peculiar image of and informa- tion about that which he calls God. The image may derive from his background, and the information may vary with the religious authors he reads. In any discussion of religion it is important to know just what God is like in the mind of the participants. For most thoughtful believers God is more like an ever-present con- ceptual rubric waiting to be given existential embodiment. It is not improper to say that the believer's conceptualization of God varies with the purposes to which he religiously applies himself, and each thing he says about God is designed to indicate the significance God has for him. According to Anselm's way of thinking, one's talk about God or in behalf of God is always designed to reestablish or reassert the existence of a greatest con- ceivable being. One says about God whatever it is best for God to be under the circumstances. Of course, some would object that God cannot be counted on to be like the end product of human rationality. From believers this objection implies that God's ways are not always our ways, that human reason is somehow insufficient or undependable. But obviously Anselm does not begin with this assumption about hu-</page><page sequence="23">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 171 man depravity. And it is noteworthy that if one does begin with the depravity of human reason in principle, it is difficult to know where to draw the line on scepticism, except by deference to out- side authority that one has chosen not to question. Finally in Anselm's favor, there is what his meditation on God exhibits about the way we carry on conceptualization in general. When we are asked to consider the possibility of the existence of a mermaid or a unicorn, we examine the term for clues to its visualization, and then we try to imagine what conditions would have to be fulfilled in order for such things to exist, given our familiarity with the ordinary use of existence. When we consider the possibility of God, which, like mermaids, we have read or heard about, we imagine what it would be like to have the experi- ence of Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob. In case the scriptural writer's description is a dramatization of the tradition with which he was familiar, the dramatization need not be determinative for knowl- edge of God in our day. Actually, having read such descriptions, we do not ask, "Does God exist?" but rather, "Is there suck a god?" The idea for God does not somehow pop into one's mind independent of the lan- guage and tradition in which one is. Rather, one begins with the present possibility and then goes on to modify, correct, and construct one's God-concept in accordance with the conditions for existence of such a being. One begins with the barest general features of all (Western) information offered us in the past, namely, that this being always seems to be in control, always does what is right, has power greater than any man in any respect, etc. In short, we note that this being is greater than any other being with which we are familiar. The idea of mermaid differs from that of God at least in the respect that while we expect the former existence to be credited or discredited in our experience with space and time, we do not expect that of the latter. If Jesus says that he is God, we do not expect that to be the case, because God is not one to whom spatio-temporal experience applies. God is a being greater than any other with which we are familiar. And yet, unless we are to be reduced to silence over the seeming uselessness of the concept of God, familiar experience in one sense is precisely the material that enables us to talk about God. With-</page><page sequence="24">172 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW out the material we should never be able to propose something superior to it. Jesus's own talk about God is always directed to the superior fatherliness, love, and steadfastness of God: power superior to that of nature or of evil. What if we discover nothing superior to nature? Does it follow that there is no god? No, the question is misleading and tempts one to fall back into the idea- actuality distinction that Anselm denies. On the contrary, there must be something superior to it, or one has not exercised himself as a rational man. God is not outside of my experience but is the principle of superiority over my experience. What, if anything, has Anselm done wrong? In spite of the polished elegance of his classic pieces of reasoning - perhaps in spite of what has been said in the present interpretation-- Anselm's language remains almost impossibly ambiguous. He relies so heavily on the universality of simple intuition that he does not bother to differentiate and specify the several senses of a crucial term. His mistake is not so much one of equivocating on the uses of one and the same term; rather, he supposes that among the uses that one and the same term have, only one is essential, truly descriptive of reality, as though we could devise a perfect language from among the many ordinary words that comprise our tongue, to depict what really is. The reader will not be taxed here with discussion of the problems that surround a philosophy of language in this respect. One need only ask by what right Anselm supposes that God more truly exists than does a stone. It is just as legitimate to talk about the stone's existence as it is to talk about God's existence. That they are different is one thing; but that one does not somehow "really exist" is misleading talk. Anselm shows a prejudice in favor of some one use among the many that a given term has in ordinary language - just as when someone is tempted to say that the "real meaning" of freedom is not license but privilege. One sense is not more essential than the other, unless the author wishes merely to flag some one sense for our present attention, recognizing, however, that the term has other perfectly meaningful uses and perfectly legitimate exemplifications. Or perhaps the author is prescribing a certain use and arguing in favor of its particular moral or esthe- tic purpose. In this way Anselm could be construed as saying</page><page sequence="25">ANSELM'S LOGIC OF BELIEF 173 that you ought to regard the existence of God in nonmaterial terms despite your great familiarity with the existence of material objects like stones. In Anselm's behalf I have argued that while neither religious faith nor unbelief entails having proof of God, nevertheless for Anselm assent to proof requires belief. Thus, Malcolm is mis- leading when he suggests that an atheist could accept Anselm's proof but remain an atheist. Such a person must, according to Anselm, either misunderstand or prefer to be irrational. Un- fortunately, Malcolm overlooks the variety of relations with believers and nonbelievers by attention to which Anselm's argu- ment should be examined. Where faith in God is already present, Malcolm offers, the proof could serve to make the faith philoso- phically more acceptable. However, I have argued, for Anselm one and the same proof is suitable for believer and nonbeliever alike; but Malcolm cannot make that fact apparent unless he subjects the concepts of belief and understanding (and their logical relations) to analysis. By attributing to Anselm a single effort to be both rational and religious we may reconstruct a plausible and interesting relationship between his famous proof and religious belief.</page></plain_text>
