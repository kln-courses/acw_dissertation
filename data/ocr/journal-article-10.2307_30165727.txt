Part cultural history, part folklore, part history of science and reference books, these works gracefully traverse</page><page sequence="2">446 Book reviews time, place and disciplinary approaches to explore a single animal's place in human history. Replete with images and written in an accessible style, they are sure to appeal to a range of audiences. In Rat, Jonathan Burt shows how the rodent depended on human migration, trade and ur- banization for its spread and flourishing. He calls it the 'totem figure of human movement and displacement' (p. 36). But despite - or perhaps because of - the animal's near-constant proximity to humans, the meanings ascribed to it were never static. While some early modern writers valued them for their medical properties, by the eighteenth century the animals had become pre- dominantly bearers of less savoury associations, including disease, economic threat, filth and sexual transgression. By the Second World War, both Britain and the US had institutionalized programmes aimed at rat eradication. At the same time, the animals flourished as pets and fan- ciers lovingly bred and monitored coat colours and strains. In the chapter 'Plague and pollution', Burt discusses the historical links between the rat and disease, especially bubonic plague. Here the common link of the rat as bearer of disease gains satisfying traction on cross-cultural compari- sons. And in an especially lovely chapter, 'Rat representations', Burt excavates the history of human ambivalence towards the animals. Like other chroniclers of the rodent in science, Burt emphasizes that it was precisely these tensions of affect - between animus and appreciation, proximity and otherness - that, in addition to its fecundity, inexpensive upkeep and general adaptability to laboratory life, facilitated the animal's becoming a chief martyr of science. Al- though Burt's book explores a wide range of topics and sources, at times one wishes for an additional sentence or two of explanation (about, for instance, bubonic plague vaccine, which is mentioned only once, and without reference to its development). Issues of imperialism, race and class surely could also play more prominent roles in discussions of vermin control, disease and cross-cultural exchange. Nonetheless, the book makes for a fascinating read, even for those a bit squeamish about Rattus. According to Macdonald, falcons have featured prominently in the imaginative life of human culture for over five millennia. 'All encounters with falcons', she writes, 'are in a strong sense encounters with ourselves - whether the falcons are real or imaginary, whether seen through bi- noculars, framed on gallery walls, versified by poets, flown as hunting birds, spotted through Manhattan windows, sewn on flags, stamped on badges, or seen winnowing through the clouds over abandoned arctic radar stations' (pp. 7-8). It is precisely this plurality of perspectives that makes Macdonald's work such a pleasure to read, and the narrative never lapses into crude an- thropomorphism or unfocused eclecticism. Falcons, she reminds us, are 'not merely imaginary receptacles for symbolic meaning' - instead, they are of flesh and feathers and push back on the cultural valences imposed on them. The art and science of falconry, and the bird's strong associations with the military and statehood, powerfully illustrate how this fastest living animal has served as a nexus for power, class and cross-cultural diplomacy. The Holy Roman emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen employed falconers from all over Europe and the Arab world; modern-day falconers continue to consult his thirteenth-century tome on falcons (p. 90). But the bird's history is not one of universal appreciation. Over the course of the nineteenth century, falcons fell out of favour in the West, and by the 1950s and 1960s persecution and environmental pressures had reduced populations to all-time lows. Macdonald discusses the efforts of alarmed falconers and ornithologists in launching one of the most successful breeding and reintroduction projects to date. By 1999 the peregrine was removed from the Endangered Species Act. Herself a trained historian of science and passionate falconer, Macdonald's personal experience and knowledge bear fruitfully on this elegant account. The book is a must for anyone interested in animals or charged with teaching from the growing literature on animal studies. Claire Preston's Bee surveys literary, visual and filmic sources to reveal the multifaceted roles of bees. Honeybees, even more strikingly than falcons and rats, live a deeply symbiotic existence</page><page sequence="3">Book reviews 447 with humans, who rely on them for honey, wax and crop pollination. Due to the complex social and labour relations among the single fertile queen (thought to be a king until the sixteenth century), the stingless male drones and the thousands of infertile worker females, the hive has long served as a canvas for normative projections about gender and polis. While the queen and her workers were lauded for their wisdom and selfless industriousness, respectively, the drones have incurred cautionary tales about sloth, invasion and otherness. But by the nineteenth century, Preston explains, even the worker bees took on a predominantly negative cast: 'The bee, once the uncontested emblem of moral rectitude in its communal cooperation, was now starting to be understood as radically, unnervingly "unselfed", a natural emblem of the anonymous and identical part in a hive which quickly began to resemble nothing so much as a mill or a foundry' (p. 139). In the delightful chapter 'Bee movie' Preston argues that, by the mid-twentieth century, fears of communist rule and the northward spread of aggressive, highly fertile Africanized bee strains into the United States gave rise to malevolent bees and menacing swarms on the silver screen. At its strongest, Preston's book mines the bee's many valences in the literary imagination from the early modern period to the present. Less satisfying is her discussion of science. Rather than problematizing and historicizing the (often productive) role of anthropomorphism in science and seeing scientific knowledge as itself a cultural product, she seems intent on separating scientific fact-finding from cultural noise: 'As long ago as the eighteenth century, when microscopy was advanced enough and naturalists disinterested enough to detect the true facts about bees, it was increasingly clear that bee-fables were to be relegated to the category of allegory, children's stories and crude folk belief' (p. 143). But overall Bee is an entertaining and informative book that reveals the animal's richly storied past and present. Each of these books offers a more or less self-contained view into the world of a single animal or species and uncovers the strong cultural mouldings the animals have suffered and enjoyed at the hands of humans. At the same time, the authors insist on the animal's agency in resisting and pushing back on these impositions. The degree to which this effort succeeds or relies on a kind of biological essentialism (to which historians of science have become especially sensitized) is largely dependent on the author's own training and predilections, whether they be in history of science, literary studies or cultural studies. Because these volumes are somewhat idiosyncratic, they will undoubtedly appeal to different scholarly audiences. But the volumes are also small enough to be read in multiples. And herein lies precisely the opportunity for the scholar of science and animal studies: these books are excellent tools with which to think about the challenges and strengths of single-animal studies across disciplinary perspectives.
