The suggestions are designed for clipping (photocopy if you don't want to cut up your book list) and pasting into each book where teachers and students can look for extended activities relating to the book's content. CRITERIA FOR REVIEW THE 65 books that appear in this anno- tated bibliography were selected as out- standing children's science trade books mainly for grades K-8 published in 1978. Books were evaluated by a special Book Review Committee (see below) appoint- ed by the National Science Teachers As- sociation in cooperation with the Chil- dren's Book Council. In general, books selected for the bib- liography meet the following criteria: (1) accurate, (2) readable, and (3) pleasing format. Committee members considered the following: Does the book encourage independent work? If experiments are used, do they lead to some understand- ing of basic principles? Are they feasible and safe? Are facts and theories clearly distinguished? Are significant facts omitted? Are generalizations supported with facts? Are differing views pre- sented on controversial subjects? Are animals and plants anthropomorphized? and, Does the book violate our basic principles against racism, sexism, and violence? Each annotation* is initialed by the reviewer who wrote it and the appropri- ate grade level of the book is given in parentheses. The addresses of the pub- lishers have been omitted in the interest of space. However, they are easily found in the monthly "Resources Reviews" section of S&amp;C or any library.
