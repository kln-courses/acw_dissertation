<plain_text><page sequence="1">Athens and the East Hallstatt Region: Cultural Interrelations at the Dawn of the Iron Age STEPHEN FOLTINY PLATES 95-96 During the excavations in the Agora in 1949, Pro- fessor Homer A. Thompson found the cremation burial of a warrior-craftsman dating from the Late Protogeometric or the Early Geometric Period.' The contents of this tomib have been described and evalu- ated (by Carl W. Blegen,2 who has shown by an ex- cellent analysis of the pottery that this burial, desig- nated as Grave XXVII, must be assigned to a transi- tional phase between Protogeometric and Geometric. Blegen has also discussed the eleven iron objects deposited in the same grave. Concerning these, how- ever, some questions remain unsolved even after his careful study. Furthermore, recent investigations have thrown new light on the problems of the pe- riod in question, and so it seems worthwhile to at- tempt a new analysis of the iron objects from Grave XXVII. They appear to be of great significance not only for the Late Bronze Age chronology of Greece, but also for the cultural interrelations and contacts between the Greek mainland and Central Europe in that period. The weapons and tools under discussion include two snaffle bits, a broad flat axe, two spearheads, a long sword, two knives, a fragment of a pin, a chisel and a hasp which prolbably belonged to the bridle bits. THE BRIDLE BITS (pl. 95, fig. I :8-9) Since our bridle bits are the earliest iron bits not only from Athens but from the Greek mainland, they have a strong claim to attention. Blegen3 did not find good Protogeometric or Geometric parallels for them. As to their form, he referred to a pair of bronze bits discovered at Mycenae. This bronze type may have come to Greece from the Near East at an earlier date, as Potratz' pointed out. But atten- tion should 'be paid to the fact that no iron bits of this kind have been found in the Near East. And we also have to take into consideration that after the fall of Mycenae trade relations between Greece and the Near East apparently ceased completely for a time. Thus the bridle bits of Mycenae cannot be considered prototypes of the Agora bits. Robinson5 and Yalouris,6 who also dealt with the bridle bits of ancient Greece, did not publish any good analogy for the Agora specimen. Thus there seems to ibe no contemporary parallel to our snaffle bits in the Aegean. We have, then, to look for their origin somewhere else: a search for corresponding bits in the Carpathian Basin and its neighboring areas will prove fruitful. As Hancar7 has demonstrated, the first bridle bits in Europe were made of antler and they were found in eastern Hungary (Bodzispart) and in south- western Russia (Usatovo near Odessa), on the steppes between the Tisza and Dniepr, around 2000 B.C. The Carpathian Basin and the Pontic region have had cultural connections at least from the Neo- lithic period onward." These contacts were main- 1 Hesperia 19 (1950) 330.

At the end of the Urnfield Culture of the Late Bronze Age in Central Europe, the rela- tions between the two areas became closer. Besides the horse bits of antler, metal bridle bits came into use in the Carpathian Basin. The bronze and iron horse trappings of the pre-Scythian population,10 referred to as the "Thraco-Cimmerians," have ap- peared in rapidly growing numbers. From the Hun- garian territory they have spread in the east Alpine region, in the northwest Balkans, in South Ger- many1 and Bohemia, in Switzerlandl2 and north Italy,"3 at the turn from the period Hallstatt B to Hallstatt C (in Reinecke's scheme). Though it is still a much debated problem when and how far the Cimmerians themselves had advanced in Central Europe,4 a continuous steppe influence was cer- tainly present there during the Bronze and the Early Iron Ages. Kossack15 has distinguished four production-cen- ters of the Hallstatt Age horse-trappings in Central Europe: Bohemia, Bavaria, western Hungary and Carinthia-Slovenia. Among these, the west Hun- garian and the southeast Alpine groups contain, in- deed, more Danubian elements than those of Bo- hemia and Bavaria. All horse-trapping types used in the Central European area during the period Hallstatt 1C appeared already in the Late Urnfield Culture of west Hungary (end of the period Hall- statt B).16 In connection with our specimen from the Agora, we are mainly concerned with the snaffle bits of west Hungary and of the east Alpine region where sev- eral good parallels have been unearthed. There is an excellent analogy from grave 27 of the Statzen- dorf cemetery17 in Lower Austria. In an urn cov- ered by a cup lay, among other objects, a pair of snaffle bits (on which the position of our hasp on the ihorse trapping can be observed), a broad flat axe and three iron knives. All these findings may be compared with the corresponding objects of our Agora grave.'

A. Mozsolics ("Splitbronzezeitliche durchbrochene Wagenbeschlige," ActaAHung 7 [1956] 12-14) does not be- lieve that the horse trappings of Zurich-Alpenquai are of Cim- merian or of pre-Scythian origin, but they may have originated in Hungary. 15 Kossack 1954, I40. 16 G.

In Somly6- vasarhely2 the horse bits were found along with a broad flat axe; in the area of the brook Sedviz"2 bridle bits, a chisel and a broad flat axe have been discovered. P6cs23 has similarly yielded an analogy for our specimen. Unfortunately, the circumstances of discovery have not been observed carefully in these finds of western Hungary. Kossack24 pointed out that there had been a close connection between the warrior graves of the south- east Alpine area (mainly those of Styria) and Ba- varia during the Hallstatt Age. Several bits are available for comparison25 from Mindelheim, Mai- sach-Gernlinden, Fiirstenfeldbruck, Gauting and Emmerting-Bruck a.d. Alz. This type-with a slight modification-is considered a characteristic shape of the period Hallstatt C in South Bavaria.26 I have been unable to find close analogies for our snaffle bits in the northwest Balkans.2,a Lack of re- search may 'be one of the reasons for this. Other items of horse trappings of the "Thraco-Cimmerian" type are known from Bosnia27 (Taline, Osovo, De- belo Brdo, Donja Dolina, Madkovac), Slovenia28 (St. Veit, Magdalenska Gora, Smarjeta, StiEna, Vace), Herzegovina29 and from Greece.so It should be noted, 'however, that the absolute chronology of these parallels is still uncertain, and that many of them seem to belong to a later date than the Agora grave." THE FLAT AXE WITH LATERAL PROJECTIONS ("XRMCHENBEIL") (pl. 95, fig. 1:6) This type has been very widely spread and has gone through several stages of development. Petrie," Dullo,"3 Bittel34 and Rieth85 have dealt with these flat axes in numerous studies. Dullo36 has distinguished three main types: those of southwest Asia, of north Caucasia and of Europe. The oldest types originated in southwest Asia and in the Aegean around the middle of the second mil- lennium B.c., and they were made, almost without exception, of bronze. The European examples have occurred only since around 800 B.c.,"7 and they are generally of iron. Dullo has assumed that they came through Troy and Greece (Dodona) to Europe. According to Bittel,"8 there are two different groups of flat axes, namely the axes of the Hittite Age in several variations and the axes of about the ninth and eight centuries B.c. These two groups differ from each other not only in their chronologi- cal position, but also in their shape. The later ones are to be connected with the European examples Joanneum in Graz for useful information on the Hallstatt Age material in Styria. 21 Gallus-Horvith 1939, pl. 52. figs.

We reproduce here two mouthpieces from San Canziano (9koc- jan). Both of them (pl. 95, fig. I:11-12) belong to bronze bridle bits. Unfortunately, the circumstances of their discovery are not known. However, they may be assigned probably to the same chronological level as the hoard from San Canziano (cf. our footnotes 89, 103 and 114). In this case, we could place them in the second half of the period Hallstatt B (in Reinecke's scheme).

While there seems to be no doubt that the axes of the older group have developed in southwest Asia,89 Bittel has thought it possible that the later speci- mens were brought back from Europe to southwest Asia.'4 Rieth, who has presented a clearly arranged sur- vey of the flat axes, has divided them into three groups,41 and made a sharp distinction between the earlier and the later bronze axes on the one side, and between the later bronze and the iron exam- ples on the other. In agreement with Dullo and Bittel, he has considered southwest Asia as the homeland of the bronze specimens and has em- phasized their role in the Late Bronze Age of Italy. By means of trade, some bronze axes may have reached southern Hungary and gone up to the east Alpine region. Their translation into iron may have taken place somewhere there. On the distribu- tion map of the bronze flat axes published by Rieth we find the following sites: Troy, Settlement VII42 (mold for a flat axe), Lindos (Rhodes), Dodona (Thessaly), Sicily (Modica and Caltanisetta-Piazza, Armerina), Sardinia (Abini and Monte San Ida), Italy (Pozzuoli and Monte Rovello) and Kiskiszeg (formerly Hungary, now Yugoslavia). Thus we have to do with an east Mediterranean type which found its way to Central Europe.43 The northern- most example is known from Kisk6szeg between the Danube and the Drava. It is of some significance that an iron flat axe was also found at the same site.44 This indicates that the translation of this type from bronze into iron took place somewhere in this region, as Rieth had assumed long ago. The butt of the Kiskiszeg 'bronze axe is not flat,45 but convexly rounded. Most of the iron examples of the northwest Balkan and the east Alpine area have the same round butt, that is they show a further devel- oped phase of evolution. The iron flat axe is a leading type of the Eastern Hallstatt Culture. Its main distribution-area is the later Roman province of Noricum and the neigh- boring territory: Upper and Lower Austria, west- ern Hungary, Styria, Carinthia, Slovenia and Bos- nia. From this center, it spread to Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, Ukraine and Rumania in the north and east, and to north Italy in the west. The nearest specimens of this type outside of Athens are known from Yugoslavia.46 There, at Ston (Stagno) in Dalmatia"4 and at three sites (Ilijak,48 Sanskimost49 and Mahrevidiso) in Bosnia- Herzegovina similar iron axes were found; the great tumulus cemeteries of Slovenia have yielded several more examples: Luterce Selo near Novo Mesto,5 Smarjeta near Novo Mesto,52 Vae,53 Rif- nik,"5 Sticna and Magdalenska Gora.5 In many cases, the circumstances of discovery are not known. Therefore, the assignment to a certain chronological phase is rather difficult. 39Stefan Przeworski, "Der Grottenfund von Ordu," AO 7 (1935) 390-414; 8 (1936) 49-68.

The axe of Sanskimost is later58: it shows a more developed shape. However, the region of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a territory of retardation.59 The specimens of Slovenia are probably older, but we have only insufficient data about their exact age. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence--as we shall see later--that iron-working started at an earlier date in the northwest Balkan area6s than in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The iron flat axes occur in abundance in Austria. They appear in Carinthia6' and Styria"2 as well as in the famous cemetery of Hallstatt"3 in Upper Aus- tria."6 In Hallstatt alone, they have been uncovered in fifteen graves, along with Hallstatt swords, spears, knives, whetstones, etc. This type is known from a great number of sites in Lower Austria (Statzen- dorf,65 Feichtenboden near Fischau,66 Malleiten near Fischau67 and Kalenderberg).68 It was associated with spears, knives and, in one case, with a pair of bridle bits. The complex of these types is charac- teristic of the level Hallstatt C in Austria and it has recently been dated approximately between 800 and 600 B.C.69 Many of these iron axes are concentrated in Hun- gary.70 Beside the example of Kiskaszeg (now in Yugoslavia), Gallus"7 has mentioned four others from Western Hungary and two from the northeast- ern parts of that country. Similar types are known from Lengyel,"7 KismezS,73 Sighegy,"7 and also from an unknown site in Hungary."7 Most of these specimens are found in association with "Thraco- Cimmerian" findings or with material typical of the horizon Hallstatt C, but the circumstances of find- ing are frequently not recorded. Willvonseder"7 and Holste77 have already considered these iron axes to be close to the "Thraco-Cimmerian" group. In Czechoslovakia78 the same type has been un- earthed at five localities, and not less than ten similar findings are reported from the Oder region.79 Three such sites have been discovered in Rumania"s and 56 Merhart 1958, 136.

Kersten published an example from Gelbenbiirg near Dittenfheim, district of Gunzenhausen in Ba- varia.83 Late forms of these iron axes are represented in north Italy:"4 in Sanzeno, Crescino, and Appia- no-Eppan. These implements seem to be foreign to Greece. Blegen has compared our specimen to a similar iron axe of Late Protogeometric times from Grave 40 of the Kerameikos cemetery.85 Both Greek examples point to an early phase. Their butts are flat and al- most straight. They must be placed at the beginning of the evolution of these tools. We will discuss their chronological position later. THE SPEARHEADS (pl. 95, fig. 1:2-3) The early iron spearheads have been little studied in Greece. Chronologically, they are less cjharacteris- tic than the implements treated above. In many cases they have been found in very bad condition and cannot be used for comparisons. As Lorimer has pointed out, their bronze prototypes were de- rived from Crete."8 Blegen has enumerated the nearest analogies"s to our iron specimens from the Protogeometric graves of the Kerameikos, and Des- borough"8 has published the list of all Protogeo- metric iron spears known in 1952. These studies, however, did not refer to the con- nections between Greece and Central Europe. In the Late Urnfield Culture (period Hallstatt B in Reinecke's scheme) of Istria89 and Czechoslovakia90 some iron spearheads have occurred. In the so-called "Fliegenhaihle" near Dane, ten iron spearheads were found beside 220 bronze spearheads. The hoard of Hostomice contained a pair of iron spearheads as- sociated with antenna-sword, knives and some other implements of bronze. In the period Hallstatt C the iron spears were spread in the northwest Balkan region and in Cen- tral Europe. Close parallels to our specimens were unearthed in Styria." The cemetery of Statzen- dorf" also yielded a pair of iron spearheads. At Hallstatt"9 at least fourteen early graves contained a pair of iron spears; in one of the graves there were three spears. In the tumulus graves of the Glasinac, the spearheads occur frequently. They are present in the earliest graves of phase IV which are dated in the period 800o and 750," and indeed in many graves of the later phases. As Truhelka95 has reported, no less than ten iron spearheads lay in a warrior's grave at Podp&amp;cine. In Vaie, the findings were not separated accord- ing to the graves, but twenty spears were recorded on the basis of typological classification."9 Some of them"9 may be compared with the Agora specimens. As Miss Lorimer has indicated,98 one thrusting spear and a sword were the most important weapons of the Greek warrior until the beginning of the Geometric Age, and this means that close-range fighting continued to prevail. However, during the Geometric Age there was a change, at least in cer- tain areas. The remains of a pair of spears (or some- times three) appeared in later graves. It is clear that the traditional method of fighting was aban- 81 A. Terenojkine, SovArk 2 (Moscow 1957) 54, fig. 4:6. 2 Petrescu-DimboviSa, 1958, 66. 83 W.

There is no doubt that our spears were throwing spears. THE SWORD (pl. 95, fig. I :I) Blegen99 found the best analogies to our long sword in the Protogeometric graves of the Kera- meikos cemetery where four similar blades were unearthed. The development of the iron swords in Greece from the end of Late Helladic III to the end of the Geometric Age was discussed by Miss Lorimer,'00 and Desborough 101 presented a list of the Protogeometric examples from Attica, Thessaly, Laconia and Crete. As Rieth has shown,102 there are close relations between the iron swords of Greece and of south- eastern Central Europe. The sword of St. Kanzian (9kocjan, now Yugoslavia)'03 of the Late Urnfield Culture (Hallstatt B in Reinecke's scheme) may be compared with those of the Protogeometric and Early Geometric Ages in Greece. It is worth noting that Merhart"04 and Sprockhoff15s referred to the southeastern Alps and the northwestern parts of the Balkans as the center of early iron-working, from which region iron swords--or at least iron sword blades-spread over wide territories: Bul- garia, Macedonia,'06 Yugoslavia, north Italy, Switz- erland,'07 Germany, Czechoslovakia1o* and west Hungary. It is well-known that the long iron sword"09 later became a characteristic type of the early Hallstatt Culture in Central Europe. This type appears also in Bosnia."0 It is interesting to mention that the rite of sword bending in burials"' was known in certain regions of Central Europe and in Bosnia. The same custom has been observed in our Agora grave and in Grave 28 of the Kerameikos ceme- tery.'2 THE KNIVES (pl. 95, fig. 1:4-5) Blegen"3 has already mentioned that iron knives do not occur frequently in the Protogeometric and early Geometric graves of the Agora or of the Kera- meikos. He did not cite any good parallel to our knives with convex cutting edge and slightly con- cave back. The iron knives of the period in question have their best analogies in the contemporary ex- amples of Central Europe. In its shape a knife blade of St. Kanzian14 appears to be similar to our speci- mens, but it is made of bronze. However it was found together with iron spearheads and iron sword. The knife of St. Kanzian belongs to the Late Urnfield Culture (Hallstatt B). An iron knife with convex back and convex cutting edge comes from the Statzendorf cemetery"" and can be as- signed to the early Hallstatt Culture of the east Alpine region. The analogies mentioned by Blegen 1have con- cave cutting edges and convex backs. This curved type became popular during the period Hallstatt C in the eastern Hallstatt area and in the northwest Balkans. It is unnecessary to mention all places where they appear, and a few sites from Yugoslavia (Vae,11' Glasinacl"7), Austria (Hallstatt,'18 St. An- drai a.d.

Kromer has dbserved in the Hallstatt cemetery'25 that knives of this type and whetstones often belong to the outfit of the warrior equipped with sword. The same is true of our Agora grave, and in the whole East Hallstatt region. It is to Ibe noted that whetstones appear in great number in the contemporary graves of northwest Yugoslavia, for instance in Va'e126 and on the Glasi- nac.127 Benac and (ovi6 called our attention to the fact that these objects show-at least in certain cases -little sign of use, although their material is adapted for sharpening. In the so-called princely graves they were prdbably ornamental objects and their posses- sion reflected the greatness and power of their own- ers. They are sometimes referred to as "scepters." And the scepter of the Mycenaean kings was the materialization of the abstract idea of power.28 Use of the whetstone as an emblem of power during the pagan Anglo-Saxon period of the seventh century A.D. is attested by the Sutton-Hoo ship-burial29 in Suffolk. Our whetstone was certainly no ornament, but the great number of iron tools and weapons suggests a high social position of the warrior buried in Grave XXVII of the Agora. The other objects from this grave-a fragmentary pin, a small chisel (pl. 95, fig. I:7) and two bone rings-are of no significance for dating or for com- parisons. Therefore we omit their detailed discus- sion here. THE EARLIEST IRON-WORKING IN GREECE. CULTURAL IN- TERRELATIONS BETWEEN ATHENS AND CENTRAL EUROPE Archaeologists and metallurgists generally agree that the earliest smelted iron appeared in the Near East.130 While the iron objects were very rare in the third millennium B.c., they were found in consider- ably greater quantity during the first half of the second millennium, and iron became well estab- lished towards the end of the second millennium, at least in certain areas of the Near East. According to Forbes,131 there is no doubt that iron was a foreign metal in the early Aegean. In Cyprus32 there are iron deposits near Soli, Paphos and Tamassos, and many traces of ancient mines have been found. The constant contacts with Ana- tolia introduced iron working to this island. But there are no notable deposits in Crete.133 In Forbes' view,34 all Greek legends about iron-working dae- mons or heroes in Crete are probably without a real foundation. These myths are based on the con- fusion of the Cretan and the Phrygian Mount Ida. It seems that these legends were originally told about the Phrygian mountains or other sites in Asia Minor where, indeed, a very early iron industry flourished. The early Greeks135 of the mainland were not eminent in iron metallurgy. They imported their iron mostly in semi-finished condition. They may have dbtained some iron locally; ore occurs in Boeo- tia, Attica, Laconia"' and some of the islands."'37 It is certain that much iron was imported from Elba and Etruria and, as we shall see, from the area of the later Roman province of Noricum. The Homeric poems do not mention iron min- ing.138 The metal had its place in the treasuries of the heroes, therefore it was not plentiful. The Greeks of the epics were seemingly without the knowledge of production method.'39 It appears that in Homer's day iron was not yet the trusted ma- terial for weapons."40 On the basis of the archaeological record we can 124 Rieth 1942, 31-32 and fig. 20. 125 Kromer 1958, 50. 126 Stark 1955,112 and pl.

Coghlan and Forbes mention"' early finds of low-nickel meteoric iron from a Tholos near Plata- nos and from Mavro Spelio. A cube of iron dis- covered at Knossos in a Middle Minoan grave (from about I8oo B.c.) is likely to be of meteoric iron. An iron finger-ring found at Pylos in the Peloponnesus (probably from 1550 B.c.) seems to be of the same origin.'42 The first evidence of man-made iron in Crete is a slag derived from the reduction of oxidized ores at the great Tholos of Hagia Triada.'3 An impor- tant class' 4 of prehistoric iron objects are the finger- rings mostly found in Mycenaean graves and built up of successive layers of different metals. A ring from Phaestos has a bronze core overlaid with gold for one-half of the circle and with iron for the other. Three metal rings found at Dendra by Pers- son are composed of iron, copper, lead and silver. These rings and their parallels can be dated from 1500 to 1200 B.c. A list of the iron objects of the Bronze Age from Minoan or Mycenaean sites is presented by Miss Lorimer."5 However, as Richard- son and Wainwright rightly state," rings, amulets and beads do not mark the beginning of the Iron Age. Only when iron tools and weapons appear and when their number tends to increase, does the production of iron really begin. The transition from copper- and bronze-working technique to the pro- duction of iron was not "easy."'47 The craft of the blacksmith is entirely different from that of the copper-worker. The iron-working "is coupled with its typical furnaces, bellows and apparatus, tongs, crucibles, etc.; the arts of hardening, carburiz- ing, annealing, quenching, and tempering are new acquisitions of several generations of smiths" (Forbes). 48 Though the earliest iron working on the Greek mainland"'9 dates from the end of the second mil- lennium B.C. (slags of Vardaroftsa C), iron first came into use for weapons during the Protogeo- metric Period around 900oo B.C.1 and still later. A good, but not complete, list of Protogeometric iron objects is to Tbe found in Desborough's important work.'51 In the Geometric Period iron became more and more common in Greece. It is worthwhile to mention that, according to Forbes,'52 iron was pos- sibly smelted at Tiryns,"53 Athens and in Laconia from the tenth century B.c. on. As mentioned above, the best and by far the greater proportion of Greek iron was imported from outside. But whence did it come to Athens? There is reason to believe that the largest part of the Athenian iron was acquired from the north, i.e. from the northwest Balkans and from the territory of the later Roman province of Noricum. In that area good iron ores were abundant. It is of great importance to note that-among other ores-the spathic,54 the ore best adapted to the groping tech- nique of early iron metallurgy, occurred in great quantity in Styria, Carinthia, in the Carpathian Basin, and it was generally distributed in Bosnia. In these regions iron smelting was preceded by a long tradition of copper smelting, and the prehis- toric metallurgists became highly skilled in the technique of copper- and bronze-working'.55 This part of the east Alpine area lies on the amber route: it was in touch not only with the Adriatic and Aege- an, but also with the Baltic region. The peoples liv- ing here were under the constant pressure of migrat- ing tribes coming down from the north. Thus the population of this territory exploited the mineral wealth offered by the environment. The central position of the northwest Balkans and the southeast Alps in the European iron metal- lurgy was recognized by Central European archaeo- logical research quite early. P.

Vogt,'16 G. v. Merhart,'6 E. Sprockhoff~'a and others have stressed the significance of this area in the evolu- tion of iron-working. In the present state of research it is still an open question as to when and how the knowledge of iron production was introduced from Asia Minor to the northwest Balkans. It may be of interest to mention Merhart,16 who believes that shortly before the fall of Mycenae some metallurgists may have gone from the northwest Balkans to Asia Minor where they learned the methods of iron-working and returned with this knowledge to their homeland. Childe'64 has considered that the abundance of metal during the Late Bronze Age must be connected with the development of mining in the eastern Alps. He be- lieved that the concentrated resources of the Mino- an-Mycenaean civilization supported the initial ex- penditure of specialist labor in this area. Mycenae "was near enough to the Alps and the Ore Moun- tains to form an effective market for raw materials. It had 'been in fact importing one raw material through Central Europe since the sixteenth cen- tury." Of course, then, prospectors may have come from there. Heurtley and Davies,"6' and later Forbes,"'6 sug- gested that the method of extracting malleable iron from the ore came from northeastern Asia Minor through Thrace and Macedonia to the northern parts of the Balkans. It can be said with certainty that at latest around the end of the period Hallstatt B (this period may be dated between ioo000 or 950 and 800 or 750 B.c.) iron-working was established in the southeast Alps. Star~'67 has pointed out that the inhabitants of Va&amp;e "were interested in the acquisition of iron" during the phase Vace I which is partly parallels68 with period Reinecke B. The vicinity of Vace is very rich in iron ores which can be collected from the upper surface. It is very probaible that the material of the earliest iron smelting was not mined in the modern sense of the term.'6 The prehistoric miner did not know of shaft-sinking, but could only drive the open-cast ahead. During the period Hallstatt B iron spread from the northwest Balkans and southeast Alps as far as to Switzerland,'7 Czechoslovakia"' and north Ger- many.'"7 Iron was first used as a part of bronze im- plements and weapons, ibut it gradually replaced the bronze, though both metals were used side by side for a few centuries. Iron-working played a very important r6le in the economic and social evolution of the northwest Balkans and southeast Alps.'73 In the Roman Age the excellence of the Noric iron was well-known and its quality was praised even by the poets.?7 According to Pliny'75 only the iron from Seres and that of the Parthians were superior to the Noric. Scholars working on the prehistory of Greece have observed the importation of iron from the north. Valmin'l7 and Miss Lorimer'77 thought it possible that an iron dagger and the knowledge of the method of producing malleable iron reached Malthi from 'Central Europe by way of the Adriatic. Another source of supply was found on the settle- ment of Vardaroftsa, about twenty miles from the mouth of the Vardar.'78 Concerning the Kerameikos, Miss Lorimer has 157 Treasures of Carniola.

In her view, iCrete was the intermediary through which the people of the Kerameikos first got their iron swords from Cyprus.180 However, it is hardly conceivable that iron was brought to Athens from Cyprus via Crete. It is more probable that it came from the iron-pro- ducing regions of the southeast Alpine area and from the northwest Balkans, since Mycenae had trade relations with Central Europe from the middle of the second millennium on and this contact con- tinued later. In addition to this, the first iron weap- ons of Athens have their parallels in Central Eu- rope, as we have seen above. The iron articles in the heterogeneous tomb-rob- ber's hoard from Tiryns 'were previously considered as imported from Syria,s18 but the amber, the long sword,182 the Hallstatt-bird on the bronze cup,lS3 and the gold wheels18" of this treasure point to the north, and the whole find is of a later date than the thirteenth century B.C. In addition to the iron objects, there is another assemblage of findings for which we have no local antecedents in the Late Bronze Age of the Aegean. Milojdi6185 and Kossack18' have pointed out that fine handmade pottery appears in several Proto- geometric graves of the Kerameikos cemetery,ls7 and it has been found also in the Agora. Some types of this ware have their 'best parallels in the so-called Vattina-Dubovac-Zuto Brdo group'88 in northeast Yugoslavia where this pottery is characteristic of the Middle and the Late Bronze Age. The center of the Vattina-Dubovac-Zuto Brdo group lies in the Banat, in the Danube area of Ser- bia, in Oltenia189 and in the Bulgarian Danube region. But it found its way along the Morava as far down as Cuprija, and into western Bosnia."' A more complete exploration of the Macedonian sites"' will probably bring important new data concerning the trade and migration routes between north 'Greece and the Danubian lands during the Late Bronze Age. The passage is easy from the Morava Valley to the Vardar Valley. In the above-mentioned graves of the Keramei- kos192 anthropomorphous idols and theriomorphic symbols were found beside shallow bowls, pointed pyxides, spindle whorls, etc. The bronze bird-head of grave 39,193 the ox-headed bronze handle of grave 48,194 the deer-shaped painted clay vessel of grave 39,195 the idols of graves 33 and 48,196 have been considered to be of Central European inspira- tion and origin."e The source of Athenian gold during the Proto- geometric and Early Geometric periods'9s may similarly be sought in the north, perhaps in Tran- 179 ibid. 115-16. 1so ibid.

There were, of course, many gold mines in Thrace, Macedonia and Greece, but Forbes'99 believes that these, or at least most of them, were exhausted soon after their tapping started in the Bronze Age. On the other hand the Carpathian Basin, chiefly Transylvania, was very rich in gold, and placer mining"0 has continued there until recent times. The knowledge of the methods of gold-producing reached this area from the Balkans.201 A highly developed gold metallurgy flourished in the Car- pathian Basin from the Copper Age (last centuries of the third millennium B.c.) on. At least four- teen sites yielding gold objects are known from the territory of the Bodrogkeresztur Culture.202 A gold pendant from Mojgrnd weighs 750 grams (Copper Age). Roska published gold finds from 125 prehistoric sites in Transylvania203 in 1942, but his list is no longer complete.2 It is of significance that native electrum205 was mined there. An axe from C6- falva206 (,which site had connections with My- cenae207 during the Central European Middle Bronze Age) was of electrum. And electrum ob- jects were in use also later. The Transylvanian gold208 had high silver content. Its color was not reddish, but pale yellow and sometimes yellow- white. Our Athenian gold spirals209 are not characteris- tic of a certain area or of a certain period. They were used as finger-rings, bracelets or hair-rings from the Copper Age on210 through the Bronze and Early Iron Ages, and even later, in wide areas of Europe.21 The Protogeometric and Early Geo- metric gold objects from the Kerameikos and the Agora have not yet been analyzed. However, the electrum ring of the Agora was imported in all probability from the Transylvanian region (if it is really made of electrum). Electrum212 occurs also in Lydia, Egypt and Spain, but we have no definite evidence for commercial connections between those areas and Athens during the period in question. The other gold objects may also have come from Transylvania or the Carpathian Basin. A possible alternative source of supply is the gold trade on the amber route. As mentioned above, the gold wheels with amber beads on the spokes in the Tiryns hoard213 show northern connections. Childe has compared these with a simpler ornament from Hradec Kralov.21'4 Western Hungary215 and Yugo- 199 Forbes 1950, 151.

At the same time these authors assume that at least a part of the gold objects uncovered in Czechoslovakia, western Hungary and Yugoslavia was produced lo- cally. And finally, we have to take into consideration that there were some local workshops in north Greece.220 Only the comparative chemical analysis of all objects will bring decisive evidence for the origin of Athenian gold during the Protogeometric and Early Geometric periods. Though no leg-greaves22' or Herzsprung shields222 have been found in Athens, it is noticeable that these types also indicate close connections between Central Europe and the Greek lands. It seems more than coincidence that, in addition to the imported copper, iron, amber, gold (and electrum), Central European types of tools, weap- ons, handmade fine pottery, anthropomorphic and theriomorphic symbols are also found in the Aegean with local products. These intrusive northern ele- ments may have arrived there partly by trade, but partly by military contact with the northern "bar- barians." At least an infiltration of smaller nomadic groups is indicated by those findings. The pertinent Protogeometric and Early Geometric sites in Athens point to two main routes of migration: the amber route (which connected north Greece with the East Hallstatt region), and the valleys of the Vardar and the Morava (through which an early contact existed between Greece and the Danube-Tisza-Transyl- vania area). There have been also other less im- portant routes (along the rivers) available. In the mixture of the native and foreign elements, the indigenous population predominated physically, but the culture of the numerically weak invaders played a large part, thanks to their metallurgical skill and 'more integrated social organization. These tribal movements may be connected with a great migration: the so-called Doric invasion which probably lasted a few centuries. The intruders from the East Hallstatt region are often identified with the Illyrians, and those from the Lower Danube-Banat area with the Thracians. CHRONOLOGY If we now return to Grave XXVII from the Agora, it will be apparent from what has already been said that concerning the chronology there can be no certainty; the conclusions offered must be considered tentative. On the basis of pottery types, our grave was assigned to the Early Geometric pe- riod in the Aegean chronological system. However, among the iron objects found in the same grave there are two types foreign to the Aegean: the bridle bits and the flat axe with lateral projections. Both of them are frequent in the eastern Hallstatt area where they belong to the period Hallstatt C in Reinecke's scheme (the horse-bits appear at the end of Hallstatt B). Thus Grave XXVII provides an important link between the two chronological systems, but its absolute date is difficult to de- termine. The end of the Protogeometric223 in Athens is placed between 950 and 875 B.c. Even if we take the low date of 875, suggested by Desborough for the beginning of the Geometric in Athens, this seems somewhat too high in the Central European scheme. But, since the chronology of Central Europe depends ultimately on Greece for its dating, we 'have to look for a solution acceptable for both systems. According to Hawkes224 Hallstatt C began about 650 "when the near-Alpine regions of Middle Eu- rope adopted iron-working." His evidence is based from Studce, district Nymburk.

However, as Merhart225 has demonstrated, the bronzes in question were first imported not north- wards out of Italy, but southwards into Italy. More- over, we have seen above that iron-working began in the southeastern Alps before 800 B.c. Archaeol- ogists in Central Europe have recently dated the beginning of the period Hallstatt C between 8oo and 750 B.c.226 But even if we suppose that the first iron flat axes in Europe originated in Slovenia and southwestern Hungary, we cannot assign to them a date prior to the last decades of the ninth cen- tury B.c. In this case, a difference of approximately fifty years would remain between the earliest Cen- tral European and the latest Aegean dates. In pres- ent circumstances we can hardly resolve the issue between the two systems. We have only clarified it for further consideration. Concerning the start of the Geometric in Athens and that of the period Hallstatt C in Central Eu- rope, Aegean and Central European archaeologists seem to be inclined to borrow dates from each other, but the decisive evidence is missing on both sides. Therefore hypothetical dates are used in both chronological schemes. There is much work on the synchronization of these systems still to do. As matters stand now, I am inclined to place our Agora grave somewhere between 850 and 800 B.c. INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY PRINCETON 225 G. v.

APPENDIX SITE INDEX OF THE IRON FLAT AXES WITH LATERAL PROJECTIONS ALONG THE AMBER ROUTE (pl. 96, fig. 2) The catalogue below gives a list of the iron flat axes found on or near the Amber Route that con- nected Greece with Denmark and the Baltic region. The list presented here cannot be considered com- plete in all details. However, it is almost exhaustive for Yugoslavia, Austria, Hungary and Rumania. Lack of research and present political conditions did not make it possible to enumerate all unpublished examples, but our distribution map and catalogue should suffice even in the present form. The sites are indicated on the map by the same number as in the catalogue. A) Attica I) Agora. Hesperia 21 (1952) 287. 2) Kerameikos. K. Kiibler, Kerameikos IV,42 and pl. 38.

While this paper was in press, I have found in old and rare publications three more Italian sites where iron flat axes were discovered. P. Orsini (Archivio di Alto Adige I [1906] 32-34) mentioned three samples of our type from Niclar (Entiklar) near Cortaccia, province of Trento. VI. Dumitrescu (L' etd del ferro nel Piceno [Bucarest I929] 37 and fig. 4: 17) recorded a similar find from Cupramarittima, province of Ascoli, and P. Laviosa-Zambotti (MonAnt 37 [I938] 539) published a good parallel from Castel- liere di S. Paolo, prov. of Trento. Concerning the Amber Route, A. Spekke's work, Ancient Amber Routes and the Geographical Discovery of the Eastern Baltic (Stockholm 1957) is of great significance.</page><page sequence="16">53 47 111 Si 12 FIG. I.
