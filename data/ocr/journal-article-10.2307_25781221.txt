<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEYOND PARADOX AND PERPLEXITIES IN TEXTES POUR RIEN: A Psychopragmatic Approach Angela Moorjani The word paradox comes from the Greek para, beyond, and doxa, opinion, thought. In this paper, I examine the Textes pour rien as reiterated instances of thinking beyond or thinking outside received models of thought and the perplexed mood that results for readers. I interrogate the performative effect of Beckettian paradox with the help of the psychopragmatics that Charles Sanders Pierce developed during the decade of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams and Beckett's birth, along with some philosophical and psychoanalytical parallels of his views on psychic semiosis. Ultimately, I maintain that with Textes pour rien, Beckett sought to put into effect artistic procedures that, beyond perplexity, induce in readers the mood required to experience a radical otherness within the psyche. First, a brief review of Peirce's approach to what I term psychopragmatics. As we know, Peirce insists on a triadic semiosis, which he defines as "an action, or influence" involving the cooperation of a sign, its object, and its interpretant (Peirce 1931-58, 5.484). By adding an interpretant, which I define as the pragmatic effect on the receiver, to the signifier-signified-referent relation, Peirce extends the semantic definition of the sign into the pragmatic realm of contextual effects and performative action. He thereby opened up meaning-making to a continuous process of psychic and social overdetermination, stretching from the unconscious mind to the shared values of community. The concept of the interpretant enabled Peirce to view interaction ? whether social or intrapsychic ? in terms of an unending process of dialogue, in which every signifying act depends on previous interpreting acts and is itself reiterated/translated by subsequent acts of signification (Peirce 1931-58, 5.284). It is, of course, the interpretant that distinguishes most markedly Peirce's definition of semiosis as an action from Saussure's. Peirce who turned everything into triads, spoke of three interpretants, that is, "emotional", "energetic", and "logical" interpretants, a division corresponding to his ontological categories of "firstness", which for the psyche consists of "qualities of feeling"; "secondness", or "the experience of effort"; and "thirdness", law or reason. Accordingly, an emotional interpretant produces a feeling; an energetic interpretant effects a physical or mental effort, and a logical interpretant, in addition 211</page><page sequence="2">to generating feeling and action, is an "interpreting thought" (Peirce 1931-58, 5.475-76; 1977, 24-26, 31). What the reader will have recognized perhaps from this brief introduction is that Peirce's pragmaticism, as he called it, is the forerunner of the theory of the performative, as well as of Derridean differance. What is perhaps less well known is that Peirce, who is recognized as one of the founders of modern semiotics, posited ? much like Freud at the same time ? a dialogue between unconscious and conscious regions of the mind. Both thinkers viewed psychic semiosis as a repetition/translation of signs from one psychic level to another, in which human rationality evolves from a somatic "it." Agreeing with both Schopenhauer and Freud, both of whose influence on Beckett is established, Peirce goes so far as to hold that, "It is the instincts, the sentiments, that make the substance of the soul. Cognition is only its surface, its locus of contact with what is external to it" (Peirce 1992, 110). For the past twenty years I have been giving psychopragmatic interpretations of Beckett's work by drawing attention to the repetition/translation of dialogue from one psychic level to the next, without origin or end. Watt and Molloy and indeed the entire French Trilogy of novels lend themselves particularly well to such a reading based on the unending repetition, or "abysmal games", of radical difference (Moorjani 1982). The paradoxicalness of these psychic transcriptions is something that is bound to startle readers. For the infinite narrative duplications of these works are placed into inside-out configurations, in which boundaries are confused, as the inside is placed outside and the outside inside; or into chaotic bifurcations and doublings, in which one becomes two becomes four becomes eight, and so on; or into retrograde inversions, denials, and unwordings, all of which place readers into states of heightened perplexity. These procedures transcribe the chaotic disorder that lurks within order and serve to make palpable the contradiction between a conscious logos and the unconscious space of the artistic imaginary. From the 1932 Dream of Fair to middling Women to the elegies of the eighties, this radical exteriority in the psyche, from which the transcription into writing takes place, is repeatedly translated in terms of a tomb and a womb in the mind containing shadow selves after death and before life. That this is the site of the imagination is apparent from Text 5 of Textes pour rien: "C'est une image, dans ma tete qui est sans force, ou tout dort, tout est mort, reste k naitre." "It's an image, in my helpless head, where all sleeps, all is dead, not yet born."1 I take this womb and tomb in the mind to be a melancholic unconscious, an inner 212</page><page sequence="3">crypt formed by repetitions of loss, loss of self, loss of other, endlessly mourned as shadow selves within the soul (Moorjani 1992, 175-95). Pitting humor against the melancholy, as Beckett is wont to do, the speaker of Text 5 exclaims: "je vais m'en aller, si ce n'est pas moi se sera quelqu'un, un fantome, vivent les fantomes, ceux des morts, ceux des vivants et ceux de ceux qui ne sont pas n6s." "I'm going to rise and go, if it's not me it will be someone, a phantom, long live all our phantoms, those of the dead, those of the living and those of those who are not yet born." The shadows of self and other, these "imaginary twins" (Bion 1974), find their equivalents in Schopenhauer's outer self in space-time searching for an inner self, that can only be grasped as an elusive phantom comparable to a migrating soul before birth and after death (Schopenhauer 1987, 1:?54, 384, n.l; 2:?41, 590-651.) Awareness of this inner shade, which Schopenhauer associates with Kant's "thing in itself, comes through feelings and the actions of willing, which are comparable to Peirce's emotional and energetic interpretants (Schopenhauer 1987, 3:529-31). It is most likely from Schopenhauer, who himself translated his concepts from a rich philosophical and mystic line, that Beckett, like so many other writers and artists, derived his form of secular mysticism, which attempts to say the unsayable space, outside the human, and outside the theological, that is the playground of his art.2 Indeed, Beckett's texts set up a paradoxical dialogue between an outer self moving in time and an inner phantom embedded in endlessness, with no certainty about the boundaries of these spaces. As one recedes from the outer self to the inner phantom, from the conscious to the unconscious, rational and empirical considerations give way to dream-like condensations, but do not stop there. Ultimately, the space of radical otherness that is Beckett's concern is outside of human and divine personifications and metaphorizations, including the figurations of tomb and womb. In addition to Schopenhauer and Kant, Plato's Timaeus would appear to be another possible intertext. (That Beckett knew the Timaeus is clear from indirect references to it in both Dream and Murphy.) In this dialogue Plato speaks of the "chora", which at least in Derrida's reconceptualization of it in "Comment ne pas parler", has much in common with Peircian firstness and the unnamable place of Beckett's writing. For Plato, this "spatial interval neither dies nor is born" and can be glimpsed only in an "oneiric" manner (Derrida 1989, 35). Neither the "id" nor a place of transcendence or immanence, for Derrida, the "chora" is "an irreducible spacing", "a wholly other place" and "a place of the wholly other", a "place as a place of 213</page><page sequence="4">writing", pointing to "something that is neither a being nor a nothingness" (Derrida 1989, 31-54). Whereas Kristeva in La revolution du langage poitique, following Plato's lead, associates the "chora" with the maternal, Derrida holds that Plato's metaphorizations of the "chora" are but one of two concurrent languages about this "space", the other being beyond theomorphic and anthropomorphic categories and nameability (Kristeva 1974, 25-30; Derrida 1989, 35-38). Beckett, too, as is perhaps clearest in Molloy, uses two such languages, one bound to maternal and paternal metaphors, the other pointing to a generative space outside such figurations. Beyond Plato, this non-metaphorical language for psychic or cosmic genesis echoes the pre-Socratic materialists and Democritus, these, too, figuring among Beckett's major intertexts. In continuing my discussion of Textes pour rien, I want to focus first on the paradoxical dialogue between different psychic spaces and the procedures that serve to exacerbate readerly perplexities. I'll begin, in a most un-Beckett-like manner, with the beginning, of Text 1: "Brusquement, non, k force, k force, je n'en pus plus, je ne pus continuer. Quelqu'un dit, Vous ne pouvez pas rester lk. Je ne pouvais pas rester lk et je ne pouvais pas continuer." 'suddenly, no, at last, long last, I couldn't any more, I couldn't go on. Someone said, You can't stay here. I couldn't stay there and I couldn't go on." The first speaker who says he couldn't go on quotes another who, on the contrary, says the first can't stay where he is. Who are these speakers? I'm tempted to say that they are the different parts of the writer's self in dialogue, the one claiming writer's block, the other urging him on. Is it the first, the second, or another speaker still, who calling himself far removed from all this, reduces the contradictory alternatives to the same: "tout cela m'est vraiment indifferent" "it's truly all one to me"? There are three different transcriptions or interpretants: I can't go on, you can't stay, it's all the same. Were one to distribute the three speakers within a psychical topology, it would suggest the ego split between the demands of conscience and the indifference of the unconscious. There is then a polyphonic interaction among three different agencies at different psychic levels. Conscience is personified in Text 1 as people who are "lk-haut, tout autour, comme au cimetfere. [...] J'?coute et ce sont les memes pens?es que j'entends, je veux dire les memes que toujours, curieux". "They are up above, all round me, as in a graveyard. [...] I listen and it's the same thoughts I hear, I mean the same as ever, strange." The thoughts from up above, to which he listens, are the received notions ? unconscious "habits" or "beliefs", in Peircian terms ? akin to the laws of debased divinities or parents, the 214</page><page sequence="5">Loy and Youdi of Molloy or Nagg and Nell of Fin de partie, for instance. Unlike Lacan and his notorious nom-du-pdre, Beckett, who often alludes playfully to the superego, obviously agrees with Freud that the child's identification with the law depends on both parents (Lacan 1966, 551-56; Freud 1961, 19:31, n.l). In Text 1 it is indeed voices of uncertain gender that send down received concepts while badgering the speaker with unanswerable questions, whereas Text 5 extends the Kantian echoes by setting up a courtroom trial in the psyche, so that "etre est etre coupable" "to be is to be guilty". The second topology is that of the outer self, the bodily ego, that makes stabs at giving retrospective narrative descriptions of his situation, unable, however, to reply univocally to the demands of the voices from up above since he is solicited at the same time by the voice of indifference from down below, for which there is neither a self, nor time, nor space, the minimum requirements of narrative. The outer self translates the conflicting demands of conscience and the unconscious by an art of paradox. Torn between the messages of the inner law (the symbolic) and the messages of the inner phantom, outside of language, the speaker undertakes their impossible transcriptions. The first-person pronoun must serve for both translations, so that at times we hear the inner law and at times the phantom self speaking through the first-person pronoun. Consequently, the "I" is both "up there" and "down here" (Text 1), projecting the deictic center of discourse back and forth, so that the "I" of enunciation is doubly split. The deictic terms in language that permit receivers to establish a context of utterance and to assign reference of person, place, and time in relation to the speaker are paradoxically unstable in the case of speakers who claim simultaneously to be an I and a not-I and a no-thing, to be here and there and nowhere, inside, outside, and in between, now and then and never. The performative action of such deictic dissonance is to leave readers without anchors and as dislocated as the clashing speakers. "II va y avoir un depart, j'en serai, ce ne sera pas moi, je serai ici, je me dirai loin, ce ne sera pas moi, je ne dirai rien." "There's going to be a departure, I'll be there, I won't miss it, it won't be me, I'll be here, I'll say I'm far from here, it won't be me, I won't say anything." is an instance from Text 3 of the first-person pronoun's wandering dislocations. And this is what happens, for example, to temporal reference in Text 1: "les temps s'emmelent, d'abord j'y avais seulement 6t69 maintenant j'y suis toujours, tout &amp; l'heure je n'y serai pas encore." "All mingles, times and tenses, at first I only had been here, now I'm here still, soon I won't be here yet." This confusion of tenses results from the impossible attempt to mediate between a 215</page><page sequence="6">symbolic and therefore linguistic temporality (the domain of conscience and the outer self) and the inner self s radical timelessness: "pour l'instant je suis lk, depuis toujours, pour toujours." "for the moment I'm here, always have been, always shall be." As in the Trilogy, what this discourse refuses to carry out is the expected representation of person, place, and time in language. Instead we have a paradoxical play with these categories which pits the all-too-familiar, which the voice resists representing, against the radically unfamiliar, that cannot be represented. This a poetics of resistance and opposition to the known doubled or shadowed by a poetics of un-knowing. Further, embedded in an "aporetic" or paradoxical duplication, which is defined as "a sequence that is supposed to enclose the work that encloses it" (Dallenbach 1989, 35), and which Beckett practices from Dream to the later plays, such as Footfalls and Ohio Impromptu, the speaker of Text 5 tells of inner phantoms that are telling his stories for him. In this manner, unable to determine who is inside or outside whose textual boundaries, readers are made to experience the out-of-bound space of the artistic imaginary. In the 1966 "Pour Avigdor Arikha", Beckett's term for this space is the "dehors imprenable", which becomes, in the English translation, a punning "the impregnable without" (Beckett 1984a, 152). How Beckett proposes to translate this extra-linguistic, extra-symbolic exteriority for his perplexed readers (or listeners, or viewers), beyond the paradoxical procedures already described, is what I will now briefly explore with the help of Schopenhauer's concept of aesthetic contemplation and Peirce's notion of interpretant. Within the maddening dialogue that keeps sundering the artistic subject of Textes pour rien and disconcerting readers, there appears, at the end of Text 1, a meditation on the performance of storytelling. Reminiscing about previous fictions, the speaker, taking on the roles of reader and listener, admits to "toujours marmonnant, les memes propos, les mSmes histoires, les mSmes questions et r?ponses [...] me benjant, me tenant compagnie, et toujours attentif, attentif aux vieilles histoires, comme lorsque mon p?re, me tenant sur ses genoux, me lisait celle de Joe Breem, ou Breen" "always muttering, the same old mutterings, the same old stories, the same old questions and answers [...] to lull me and keep me company, and all ears always, all ears for the old stories, as when my father took me on his knee and read me the one about Joe Breem, or Breen". The story of Joe Breem, unlike the games of fort and da that Beckett has imbedded into his works, does not end with the gone or exiled position, but with a return home. It's a tale of make-belief for children, quite unlike the dislocation of exile suffered 216</page><page sequence="7">by the speaker. As such it functions as a calmative, not only by what it tells, but more importantly, by the very act of being repeated endlessly, it serves as a buffer against the terrors of separation and night and death. ("Le Calmant" "The Calmative" is, of course, the title of the short fiction that first embedded this story-telling scene. Beginning with "Je ne sais plus quand je suis mort"/"I don't know when I died", "Le Calmant", moreover, is one of the first texts in which the first-person voice itself utters the paradoxical condition of being simultaneously in endlessness and time.) The story-telling scene, this "murmur of memory and dream" (Text 12), unlike so many others, is not unsaid. Instead, the speaker of Text 1, holding himself in his arms, rather than battling his inner voices, murmurs to himself as if it were a lullaby: "Dormons, comme sous cette lointaine lampe, emmetes, d'avoir tant parl?, tant ecoute, tant peine, tant joue." 'sleep now, as under that ancient lamp, all twined together, tired out with so much talking, so much listening, so much toil and play." In telling of the repeated effect on him of this "tale for children" and listening always for the same old stories, which have helped him hold out, this Beckettian speaker agrees with Schopenhauer that through the distanciation of contemplation, self distanced from self, art offers comfort in a world of loss and grief (Schopenhauer 1987, 1:?52, 372). And the dividing into two to rock oneself to sleep, to lull oneself by stories will reappear in Beckett's plays some thirty years later, whereas already twenty years earlier in his essay on Proust, Beckett compared the famous scene in A la recherche du temps perdu, in which the narrator's mother comforts her son by reading to him through the night, to the action of a lullaby (Beckett 1957c, 53). So that despite, or rather, because of, the melancholy and the spiritual homelessness (and its materializations in time and space), this "babble of homeless mes and untenanted hims," as Text 12 has it, which readers are made to share via deictic dislocation, readers are meant to take comfort in having the tales told or performed for them so that at least for a time ? the time of reading, the time of play ? the suffering of separation and loss are kept at bay. Beckett's performances of storytelling, which are repetitions of repetitions, ultimately seek to induce a pleasant state of consciouslessness, or a "profounds of mind. Of mindlessness" as at the end of Ohio Impromptu, leading to the shadow realm which is out of bounds to any human language game and yet paradoxically the wellspring of art. In terms of the action on the receiver and the different interpretants, readerly perplexities come at the level of the logical interpretant, which is an interpreting thought, for as we have seen, 217</page><page sequence="8">Beckett's paradoxes are an affront to the logos and its principles of identity and non-contradiction. Yet, by keeping readers and viewers working at trying (in vain) to translate the unfamiliar into the familiar, these paradoxes function pragmatically to keep readers and viewers bound to the interaction. As for the energetic interpretant, Beckett's works, by denying us our habitual ways of reading or viewing or thinking have the effect of impelling us in the direction of a radical otherness out of reach of the understanding.3 The importance Beckett attaches to the emotional interpretant, as evident from the calming action he ascribes to storytelling, helps to explain why he was so reluctant to discuss ideas as compared with performance, insisting, for example, for Godot in 1952, that, "Estragon, Vladimir, Pozzo, Lucky, leur temps et leur espace, je n'ai pu les connaitre un peu que tr&amp;s loin du besoin de comprendre" "Estragon, Vladimir, Pozzo, Lucky, their space and time, I was able to know them a little only at a great distance from the need to understand" (Beckett 1994; my translation). Already the early narrator of Dream imagines writing as a musical performance, contemplating a "purely melodic" book that would be "a pleasure to hear" (Beckett 1992, 10), and Beckett, of course, adapted a musical title for Textes pour rien, a play on "mesure pour rien". Akin to a "mesure pour rien," which is a silent bar of music that is counted before beginning to play, thus serving to set the tempo, the Textes pour rien point to the silence of the artistic space out of which writing and speaking evolve. The da capo structure, too, may be said to correspond to the different temporality of this space, without beginnings, endings, identities. And Beckett's notorious statement that his work is a "matter of fundamental sounds", which he qualifies with "no joke intended" (Beckett 1984a, 109), is an example of his humorously undercutting what matters profoundly to the artist: the materialization of the spiritual or the spiritualization of the material that is the sign of the artist's reach into the "profounds" of inner space. Sounds and silence, rhythms and repetitions, the semiotic as compared to the symbolic, are the most immediate effects of art ? Peirce identified them with firstness, or feeling ? and the ones that perhaps least faithlessly translate the difference from language of the artist's imaginary space. Peirce's firstness is the semiotic-pragmatic equivalent of the poststructuralist emphasis on the materiality of the signifier within a Saussurian framework. Kristeva's pre-symbolic "semiotic chora", a different reconceptualization of Plato's "chora" from Derrida's, is an unconscious and unnamable space, for instance, with which the nonverbal signifier ? sound, gesture, rhythm ? reverberates.4 The 218</page><page sequence="9">reason for preferring Peirce's view of semiosis to those of Lacan and Kristeva, among others, which are loosely based on Saussurean linguistics, is Peirce's semiotic-pragmatic emphasis on the psyche as a process of semiosis involving an unending chain of interpretants translating the other self to self and self to other and ultimately determining action. Additionally, Peirce's "firstness" is not implicated with the maternal, or an avatar of the eternal feminine, as is the semiotic for Kristeva. Akin to the two languages about the Platonic "chora" that Derrida hypothesizes, the semiotic may, on the one hand, in the guise of the the socially coded nonverbal substratum of language ? non-linguistic sound and silence, touch, and bodily rhythm, for instance ? hark back to the first interactions between infant and other, and therefore, more often than not, between infant and mother, with their attendant conflictual feelings, but beyond that, semiotic firstness may induce the contemplation pointing to the exteriority of artistic space that is Beckett's concern.5 In conclusion I will try to clarify, if briefly, the role of semiotic firstness in relation to the artist's inner alterity by turning to Proust and Beckett's essay on his novel. As you may recall, in La Prisonni&amp;re the writer Bergotte, who is ill, but seemingly not mortally so, dies while contemplating Vermeer's View of Delft (Proust 1988, 3: 692-93). Proust himself, also ill, had gone to see the painting, which he called the most beautiful in the world, shortly before rewriting the passage (Proust 1988, 3:1683, 1740, n. 2). In an instance of semiotic firstness, it is not the represented content of the painting, but a small rectangle of layered yellow paint (the "petit pan de mur jaune") that has an overwhelming emotional and energetic impact on Bergotte. And he bitterly regrets that he did not try to achieve in his own writing the precious materiality of Vermeer's luminous patch of color. But how is one to understand the writer's death which is surely an extreme effect even for a beholder of a Vermeer painting? Following the character's death, the narrator's musings about a space which we leave at birth and return to after death, and whose unknown laws we obey, make it apparent that Proust is here describing the artist's inner otherness under the influence of Schopenhauer, an influence Beckett pointed out in his 1931 essay. Bergotte's death is, as it were, an enactment of the loss of self in the rapture of contemplation, or of art inseparable from endlessness in the mind. In his essay on Proust, Beckett does not say whether Proust only wrote about contemplation or whether through the materiality of his writing he helped induce it as he had shown Vinteuil's music and Vermeer's patch of yellow paint to do and as he had shown Bergotte to 219</page><page sequence="10">want to do through his words. What is certain, though, is that Beckett increasingly in his own writing has such effects in mind, not as a theme, as in Dream and the essay on Proust, or by embedding pictorial, musical, or other semiotic models, such as bird song, into Watt and Molloy, but by the very texture of his works. Textes pour rien is one of his first pared-down works which by its variations and repetitions effects, together with the perplexity of dislocation, a calming, contemplative, and even hypnotic experience of the otherness of art. Notes 1. Owing to the shortness of each of the thirteen Textes pour rien, I will dispense with page numbers after quotations. 2. Among the precursors to his timeless will, Schopenhauer mentions the brahmanist or buddhist transmigration of souls and Kant's "Ding an sich" "thing in itself", which, as Schopenhauer specifies, is a transcendental conception of an inner endlessness of being (Schopenhauer 1987, 2: ?41, 590-651; 3: 621-22). Beckett adds the Christian sense of limbo to these conceptualizations, as in Text 5: "il sera prid pour mon ame, comme pour celle d'un mort, comme pour celle d'un enfant mort, dans sa mere morte, pour qu'elle n'aille pas dans les limbes, c'est joli, la thdologie." "prayers will be offered for my soul, as for that of one dead, as for that of an infant dead in its dead mother, that it may not go to Limbo, sweet thing theology." 3. For two brilliant discussions of the performative effects of Beckett's late texts, emphasizing the saying or performance as inseparable from the said, see Gidal (1986) for a materialist and political perspective and Locatelli (1990) for a hermeneutical and dialogical reading. 4. Interestingly enough, Kristeva's association of the "semiotic chora" with Dionysian jouissance, on the one hand, and with the death drive, on the other, is anticipated in Beckett's Dream, in which the narrator's imagined "melodic" book would involve Dionysian ecstasies and the creative mind "suddenly entombed" (Kristeva 1974, 22-30, 77; Beckett 1992, 10, 16-17). 5. Not only Schopenhauer and Peirce, of course, link aesthetic contemplation or action to the "semiotic", whether in the form of artistic or non-artistic sensuous impressions or Peircian "firstness", The romantics, symbolists, and Baudelaire and Proust, in particular, celebrate the performative effects of semiotic materiality and its reach into unconscious artistic space. As apparent from papers and discussion at both the 1992 and 1996 international Beckett conferences in The Hague and Strasbourg, Beckett scholars are increasingly sensitive to the materiality of Beckett's productions, if not necessarily in relation to artistic alterity. 220</page><page sequence="11">Works Cited Beckett, Samuel, Molloy (Paris: Minuit, 1951). ?, En attendant Godot (Paris: Minuit, 1952). ?, Nouvelles et Textes pour rien (Paris: Minuit, 1955). ?, Fin de partie (Paris: Minuit, 1957a). ?, Murphy, 1st publ. 1938 (New York: Grove, 1957b). ?, Proust, 1st publ. 1931 (New York: Grove-Evergreen, 1957c). -, Watt, 1st publ. 1953 (New York: Grove, 1959). ?, Stories, Texts for Nothing, in No's Knife: Collected Shorter Prose 1945-1966 (London: Calder and Boyars, 1967). ?, Disjecta: Miscellaneous Writings and a Dramatic Fragment, ed.
