<plain_text><page sequence="1">De Godenschildering in Ovidius' Metamor- phosen. By J. C. ARENS. Nijmegen: Druk- kerij Gebr. Janssen, 1946. Pp. xii+192. The present work, a dissertation accepted by the Roman Catholic University of Nijme- gen, purports to give a complete account of Ovid's views of the Olympians as presented in his Metamorphoses. A summary of the existing literature beginning with E. Rohde (1876) is followed by a chapter on the peculiar character of Ovid's muse, bringing out the important fact that the poet is throughout dominated by purely aesthetic preoccupations. This pre- amble precedes a clear analysis of the various episodes dealing with the "private lives" of the Olympians: their petty rivalries and jealousies and their interference with the lives of mortals. In conclusion Ovid's dependence on the Alexandrians is analyzed under the following subjects: anthropomorphism, modernization, treatment of eponymous deities (personifica- tions), points of difference between Ovid and the Homeric-Hesiodic traditions, use of humor and irony, etc. While the loss of most of Ovid's sources makes a detailed comparison impossible, still the few cases where such a comparison is prac- ticable, e.g., where Ovid imitates Nicander, Callimachus, and Vergil, show that the Roman poet was no slavish imitator but that he dis- plays considerable originality in modifying, adapting, and combining his sources. It would be interesting to determine how much Ovid's training for the bar contributed to give his poetry that peculiar slant: a lively and scintil- lating humor, very much less pronounced (so far as one may form a judgment from the ex- tant materials) in his Greek models. tALEXANDER H.
