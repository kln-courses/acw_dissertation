CALIFORNIA AND THE GREAT BASIN CALIFORNIA. The Archaeological Study Center at California State University, Sacramento completed numerous archaeological projects in 1982 and early 1983, of which several are reported here. Three major studies were completed in the lower Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys and delta. Carol Kielusiak investigated the distribution and variability of baked clay artifacts from 26 sites. A major aspect of her study concerned the brownware pottery tradition on the lower Cosumnes River drainage and along the adjacent Sacramento River; it appears to be of local derivation from a long tradition of baked clay artifact manufacture. Donna Sheeders reports an interpreta- tion of Early Horizon settlement patterns that is quite different from prevailing descriptions. She concludes that the Early Horizon occupants of central California, known at cemeteries but not at villages or campsites, left many settlements along sloughs, small streams, and major rivers that have gone unrecognized. Information from CA-Sac-265, CA-Sac-67, CA-SJo-91 and several other nearby sites clearly suggests that Early Horizon populations were staying at certain locations for con- siderable periods of time. A major cemetery at CA- SJo-9 1, newly identified as of Early Horizon affiliation, also changes previous conceptions about the culture of these people. The virtual lack of grave goods with the 45 interments contrasts sharply with earlier-reported cemeteries having artifacts associated with 80% to over 90% of burials, casting doubt on previous statements suggesting that these Windmiller people were a very egalitarian society because so many of them shared in the wealth. Steven Dondero identified two lithic reduction se- quences at CA-Eld-426: bifacial reduction for the maintenance of imported artifacts and primary reduc- tion of locally available stream cobbles for the man- ufacture of core and flake tools. The Cottonwood Creek Project at the proposed Tehama Lake resulted in the recording of prehistoric and historic sites and many isolated core tools. This reservoir is only four miles south of the proposed Dutch Gulch Lake, in the heart- land of the Bald Hills Wintun, but the cultural re- sources there are significantly different from those of Tehama Lake. The prehistoric sites at Cottonwood Creek, on the periphery of Nomlaki Wintun territory, are smaller and have far fewer house pits, and there is no evidence of large historic dance houses that might have been associated with the Ghost Dance or other similar ceremonies. Also in contrast to the Dutch Gulch locality was the virtual absence of nineteenth-century gold and platinum-mining activity in the Tehama Lake area. In conjunction with the Dutch Gulch Lake project, investigations continued at CA-Sha-290. Richard Hughes of the University of California, Davis, studied the projectile points using x-ray florescence techniques and determined that the majority of the specimens came from an obsidian source in the Tuscan Formation on the east side of the northern Sacramento valley, once the mysterious "source x." John Dougherty iden- tified a type of cobble tool previously unreported from this part of California; made from split elongated cob- bles, they apparently were used as draw knives in woodworking. Steven Dondero found burned human bone fragments suggesting that cremation might have been practiced in this part of California. 181</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Peak and Associates undertook a data recovery pro- gram at CA-Plu- 115, located on Boathouse Point, Bucks Lake, Plumas County, finding over 18,000 artifacts, including more than 100 temporally-diagnostic pro- jectile points. Settlement commenced about 4,000 years ago and extended to the Historic period. Two, and possibly three, components are present. Projectile points typologically similar to the Great Basin Stemmed series characterize the basal levels, but they overlap with oth- er large point types. Rose Spring and Gunther variants appear after 1940 B.P. and before 840 B.P. Scouting parties of hunters probably created the earliest settle- ment, but by 640 B.P. the general range of subsistence activities undertaken indicates that small family groups were present. In the ethnographic period and probably during the entire occupational sequence, the project area was occupied only in the fall and summer, due to the severity of winter snowfall. During 1982, Susan K. Goldberg and Michael J. Moratto, of INFOTEC Inc., supervised test excava- tions and midden sites 05-16-51-250, -51-262, -51- 301, -52-303, -53-202, and -53-296 in the Stanislaus National Forest. This work, funded by the U.S. Forest Service, led to several inferences: while all sites were occupied sometime between A.D. 500 and 1300, three also contained at least one earlier component; only one site showed firm evidence and two, tenuous evidence, of occupation after ca. A.D. 1300. The apparent late prehistoric abandonment of sites characterized by portable milling equipment, and intensive use during that same period of sites with bedrock mortars, be- speaks a subsistence-settlement shift perhaps relating to climatic change and/or to population replacement. A full report of findings has been submitted to the Stanislaus National Forest in Sonora. Also during 1982, Moratto and Marcus R. Arguelles of INFOTEC documented 17 sites on the Kern and Pixley National Wildlife Refuges in the southern San Joaquin Valley, including lithic scatters and middens with surface artifacts (including Lake Mojave, Parman, and Crescentic bifaces) indicative of early Holocene age. Sites are concentrated on the banks of former sloughs associated with high water stands of ancient Lake Tulare. The 1982 fieldwork shows that both soil types and elevations related to past water levels are sensitive markers of archaeological site location in the Tulare Lake basin. INFOTEC's report has been sub- mitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Port- land, Oregon. Between April and June, 1983, INFOTEC tested sev- en prehistoric habitation sites in the upper Sacramento River canyon, Shasta County. Funded by the Califor- nia Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the pre- liminary results show nearly ubiquitous occurrence of the late prehistoric/protohistoric "Shasta Complex," marked by Gunther Barbed projectile points and hop- per-mortar bases. Also revealed at one site was a much earlier component, characterized by Northern Side- notched and various large, wide-stemmed points. Cur- rent studies will attempt to clarify the geographic and temporal landmarks of the ethnic boundary between the Wintu (Nomtipom) and Shasta (Okwanuchu) cul- ture spheres. Christopher Raven is serving as principal investigator, Moratto is project manager, and Goldberg is field director. Co-principal investigator Roberta S. Greenwood (Greenwood and Associates) investigated a major historic component at one of the sites. Throughout 1982 and 1983 INFOTEC archaeolo- gists continued to analyze data and prepare the final report on the New Melones project, funded by the Bu- reau of Reclamation, in the central Sierra Nevada. Three or more prehistoric components, as well as nineteenth- century aboriginal features, have been identified in midden strata as much as 1 m deep at 04-Cal-S-286. Thirteen C- 14 age determinations show that the mid- den developed mostly after ca. A.D. 1200. Noncon- formably underlying the midden is a yellow clay ov- erbank deposit, also as much as 1 m thick, whose upper levels have been dated at 5120 ? 170 B.P. (UCR- 1439A); the lower levels of the clay remain undated, but are thought to be 7,000 to 8,000 years old. Asso- ciated with this clay is an industry characterized by large percussion-flaked bifaces and distinctive scrapers of chert, along with elongate hammerstones and a few manos. At site 04-Cal-S-347, stratified cultural depos- its as much as 2.8 m deep have been C- 14 dated earlier than 6640 ? 300 B.P. (UCR-1449A). Together, sites 04-Cal-S-286 and 04-Cal-S-347 provide the longest archaeological record known on the Sierran west slope. Moreover, they contain palynological evidence that the oak-grass parkland (savanna), now widespread in the Sierra Nevada foothills, may be an historic artifact. Six volumes of the report on the New Melones project have been submitted to the National Park Service. These include major contributions by M. Arguelles, S. Gold- berg, D. Grayson, R. Greenwood, M. Moratto, S. O'Brien, L. Shoup, W. Singleton, and W. Spaulding. Between 1980 and 1982, prehistoric and historic in- vestigations were conducted in conjunction with the Hopkins Land Exchange, Tahoe National Forest, near Truckee, by Intermountain Research (IR) under the direction of Robert G. Elston and Donald Hardesty, with assistance from Sheryl Clerico and Charles D. Zeier. The four historic sites studied are the remains of charcoal-making activities carried out by immigrant Chinese. Three types of prehistoric sites were inves- tigated through surface collection and testing: a basalt quarry, short term base camps associated with the quarry, and longer term base camps, probably occupied during the summer gathering season. Although the bas- alt quarry and associated base camps appear to have been in use only during Martis times and earlier (2000 B.C. to A.D. 500), occupation of the summer base camps was continuous to ethnographic times. Prehis- toric site types were discriminated by variations in frequencies of debitage and biface types. During the summer of 1981, Catherine Fowler, Rob- ert G. Elston, Maribeth Hamby, and Jo Ann Nevers (IR) completed an ethnohistoric and ethnoarchaeolog- ical study of a Washoe cemetery at Camp Richardson, Lake Tahoe, for the Eldorado National Forest. Com- parisons were made between traditional Washoe and immigrant burial practices, and the acculturation pres- sures leading to the development of contemporary Washoe burial patterns were discussed. At the prehistoric obsidian quarry of Sugarloaf Mountain on the China Lake Naval Weapons Center near Coso Hot Springs, surface collections and test 182 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH excavations were undertaken in 1981 at several sites by Robert G. Elston and Susan Seck. Two tentative lithic production systems were identified, one based on production of prismatic blades and the other based on the production of large bifaces. A geological recon- naissance of stream and road cuts was also made to examine the regional stratigraphy and soil develop- ment. It was concluded that although obsidian frag- ments litter the ground surface and are present through- out the soil profile, those which are cultural in origin can be distinguished from natural pyroclasts by their stratigraphic context, morphology, and degree of weathering. During 1981 and 1982, Steven R. James (IR) con- ducted a survey of the Lava, Port Wine, and Table Mountain Timber Sales in the Plumas National Forest near La Porte in the Northern Sierra Nevada. Prehis- toric sites consisted of small isolated bedrock mortars, basalt lithic scatters representing temporary campsites and hunting stations, and rock art. In the Table Moun- tain area, diagnostic projectile points included Bucks Lake Wide Stem, Rose Spring Contracting Stem, and Gunther Barbed, suggesting occupation of the area from ca. 4000 B.P. to the historic period. The Port Wine area yielded most of the historic sites such as cabin remains and ditches, the result of hydraulic mining. From fall 1981 to summer 1982, Arnie L. Turner (IR) supervised the intensive cultural resource survey of approximately 6,070 ha of Tahoe National Forest Lands in the northern Sierra Nevada, recording 66 sites and isolated artifacts and features. The prehistoric ma- terials were analyzed and interpreted in reference to a Washoe and Maidu subsistence-settlement model for- mulated for the project. Inferences from the data in- dicate the possibility of greater exploitation of the more rugged, mountainous terrain for hunting during Early to Middle Martis times with a decline in use during the Late Martis and Kings Beach periods in favor of valley ecotone occupation. Additionally, it appears that if the territory around Sierraville and Loyalton had been used by both Washoe and Maidu groups, their use was equivalently seasonal in nature. The historical data gathered during the survey suggest heavy and con- sistent logging activity extending from at least the 1860s into modem times. In fall, 1982 Steven R. James (IR) conducted an intensive archaeological survey of the proposed waste- water reservoir and associated developments in Dia- mond Valley, Alpine County. One of two historic sites is Snowshoe Thompson's house site. Occupation of the area extends back to at least 2000 B.C. Philip J. Wilke of the University of California, Riv- erside (UCR), completed investigation of a large rock art site in upper Renegade Canyon, Coso Range, Inyo County. Excavations revealed a substantial midden in the immediate vicinity of hundreds of petroglyphs, containing Elko and Rose Spring projectile points, abundant obsidian flaking waste, and a few milling implements. Faunal remains identified by Donald K. Grayson (U Washington) were mostly those of small mammals with almost no evidence of bighorn sheep having been consumed in the vicinity. The excavations were designed specifically to test the long-popular no- tion that the rock art, which contains abundant draw- ings of desert bighorn sheep, had been executed as hunting magic in the pursuit of that species. Detailed recording and analysis were carried out on more than 3,550 petroglyphs in an effort to discern patterning with respect to environmental and cultural variables. These included 1,400 drawings of bighorn sheep. Revised estimates place the total number of prehistoric draw- ings in the Coso Range above a hundred thousand, of which probably one-third are of sheep. Wilke thinks that the low frequency of sheep bones in sites rules out the idea that hunting magic was the purpose of the art. Alternative interpretations of the function of Coso Range and Great Basin rock art appear to be in order; Carol Rector is currently undertaking a re-examination of the reputed hunting context of major Great Basin rock art sites. NEVADA. During the spring of 1982, Arnie Turn- er (IR) directed the archaeological investigation and evaluation of the historical Southern Pacific signal sta- tion of Fenelon. It was found that Fenelon had origi- nated as the telegraph station of Otego in 1864 on the old Central Pacific Railroad. Apparently, Fenelon nev- er attained any greater importance than a signal station, side track, and ephemeral 1902 reconstruction camp. For the past three years, a program of cultural re- sources management and archaeological research has been directed by Robert G. Elson (U Nevada, Reno/ UNR) on the ca. 4,860-ha Gund Research and Dem- onstration Ranch in Grass Valley. J. 0. Davis (Desert Research Institute) has mapped the relative ages of geomorphic features such as fans and shorelines of Pleistocene Lake Gilbert and has identified Mazama ash from several localities in Grass Valley. David B. Madsen (Antiquities Section, Utah Historical Society) has analyzed a pollen record from Potato Canyon Peat Bog which spans the last 7,800 years, while James Firby (UNR) has identified molluscs from the bog deposits. James Young (Renewable Resources Center, UNR) has identified seeds from prehistoric hearths; Helen Wells (UCR) prepared a prehistoric and historic overview of Grass Valley, while Elston summarized the archaeol- ogy of the Gund Ranch. Wells sampled portions of the Simpson Park Range to gather data for her dissertation project concerning ethnohistoric pinyon use. Steven Simms (U Utah) collected seeds of several grass species in experiments for his NSF-supported dissertation project on a cost/benefit analysis of hunter-gatherer foraging behavior. Portions of the early Holocene shoreline of Lake Gilbert have been surveyed by Laurel Crittenden (UNR), who located an extensive pre-Ar- chaic site containing Great Basin Stemmed points, crescents, and other tools. Under the direction of Don- ald Hardesty (UNR) Mary Panelli has mapped and made surface collections at several historic sites on the Gund Ranch as part of her M.A. thesis study of "Bonus Veteran" homesteads. Also on the Gund Ranch, ex- perimental plots to measure the effects of range mod- ification activities (fencing, water collection, drilling) on cultural resources are in place and being monitored; observations of the effect of past modifications have also been made. Elston would like to hear from anyone who is doing or who has done similar experiments. Peak and Associates, Inc. recently conducted an in- 183</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tensive survey of over 810 ha on the South Fork Hum- boldt River Shosone Reservation, southeast of Elko. The work was authorized by the Nevada Intertribal Council and the South Fork Tribal Council in prepa- ration for range improvement. The areas covered were dissected alluvial fan terraces above the river valley, where elevations ranged from 5,750 feet to 6,100 feet. There are no permanent water sources in this sage- brush-grassland steppe, but numerous seasonal drain- ages cut across the area. This has resulted in the development of small, flat valleys surrounded by steep- sloped terraces. The majority of the 19 identified sites are located near, but not on, the edges of the terraces above the streamcut valleys. Two subjects are of in- terest. First, there are no projectile points that relate to the use of the bow and arrow; the most common points are of the Elko series, dated as occurring from 2000 B.C. to A.D. 500. Second, there is nearly a total absence of ground stone tools. Only two sites yielded a grinding slab, with one having a shaped handstone. A lack of women's tools suggests that the sites were hunting camps used by men. The position of most sites near the edges of the terraces, overlooking the stream valleys, leads to the inference that the hunters camped there while waiting for game. The fact that the camp- sites are not on the terrace edges indicates an attempt at concealment, while the finds of isolated projectile points and flakes support the assumption that the entire area was used for hunting and other activities. OREGON. Archaeological investigations are being conducted at the Dietz Site (35-LK-1529), which has yielded over 50 Clovis artifacts from a controlled sur- face collection. The site is located in the northern Great Basin, in northern Lake County. Research is being co- ordinated by John L. Fagan (Portland District, Corps of Engineers) under an Antiquities Act Permit for in- vestigations on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) property. The site extends over an area of 1,000 by 500 m at the edge of a former Pleistocene lake on the west side of a ridge, which previously extended into the lake. Investigations have been assisted by BLM archaeologists Jack Witherspoon, Bill Cannon, and Hugh Bunten. A large crew from the University of Oregon, organized by C. Melvin Aikens and Don E. Dumond, mapped locations of artifact clusters, made controlled surface collections from several parts of the site, conducted geological auger testing and excavated two 1 x 1 m-test pits. Jeff Flenniken and Peter Meh- ringer, with a crew of graduate students from Wash- ington State University, excavated eight 1 x 1 m-test pits, prepared stratigraphic profiles and collected soil samples. Lee Sappington (U Idaho) has initiated trace element studies of the obsidian artifacts. The site ap- pears to be a campsite and workshop occupied by Clo- vis hunters, who left evidence of their stay in the form of fluted point fragments, flute flakes, and blanks or preforms which were broken in fluting. Locally occur- ring obsidian was flaked into bifaces and fluted points, and exotic obsidians from at least three other sources were left in the form of used and broken point frag- ments, flute flakes and biface thinning flakes. UTAH. The University of Utah Archaeological Center is completing analysis and report preparation for an MX missile contract that was in progress when the Great Basin location was rejected by President Rea- gan. The conclusions of the systematic surveys are being reported by Richard N. Holmer and Joel C. Janetski. The findings of the "MX Intuitive Surveys" are being reported by Steven R. Simms, La Mar W. Lindsay and Steven R. James. Simms discusses how the curation of ground stone tools can alter the archaeological re- cord and affect interpretations of surface artifact data, and Lindsay organizes the extensive, but unpublished information on late Pleistocene/early Holocene arti- facts from the Escalante-Sevier Desert areas. Several sites in the Escalante-Sevier Desert area have yielded Clovis points with numerous sites yielding points of the "Western Stemmed-Point Tradition." The pres- ence of marsh and/or deltaic deposits containing large quantities of organic material increases opportunities for dating these early sites. Since 1978, the University of Utah Field Summer School has been held at Nawthis Village, a large Fre- mont habitation site near Salina. Excavations at Naw- this under the supervision of James O'Connell, Duncan Metcalfe, and Kevin Jones have been directed pri- marily at the recovery of data such as faunal remains, plant macrofossils and pollen, from the floors of struc- tures, exterior "living surfaces," and other features. Analysis of data recovered so far suggests that Fremont diet at this site was based on a broad array of wild and domestic resources. Animals most commonly repre- sented include deer, cottontail, jackrabbit, and both tree and ground squirrels. Domestic turkey has also been identified. Flotation samples are dominated by the seeds of cheno-ams and grasses, though corn is also present in substantial quantity. Pollen samples suggest that Typha may have been an important food source, though it is not clear whether root stocks, seeds, pollen or some combination of these was actually consumed. C. Melvin Aikens CARIBBEAN GENERAL. Researchers at the University of Georgia (U Ga) Zooarchaeology Laboratory examined several vertebrate collections from the Caribbean dur- ing 1982 and 1983. Materials from a preceramic midden at Krum Bay, Virgin Islands were examined for Emily Lundburg (U.S. Virgin Islands Planning Office). The majority of the Krum Bay animals were reef fishes, with few mammals or birds, and few sea turtles. Yvonne M. Narganes Storde studied midden ma- terials excavated from Sorce, Vieques, Puerto Rico, assigned by the excavator, Luis A. Chanlatte Baik, to Saladoid and Huecoid time periods. Remains of extinct insectivores and rodents (Nesophontes edithae; Isolo- bodon portoricensis; and Heteropsomyns insulans) as well as sea turtles and marine fishes were identified. Analysis of fish remains recovered by David R. Wat- ters on Barbuda and Montserrat has just begun. There appear to be different species of fish recovered from sites on the two islands, representing distinct localized fish habitats. 184 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH Vertebrate fauna from two historic sites have also been studied. Sixteenth-century Puerto Real, Haiti, was excavated by Charles A. Fairbanks (U Florida) and Kathleen A. Deagan (Florida State Museum). Drax Hall is an eighteenth to nineteenth-century Jamaican plantation excavated by Douglas V. Armstrong (U Cal- ifornia, Los Angeles/UCLA). The faunal assemblage at both sites contained large numbers of cattle. This use of cattle by early prehistoric peoples in the Carib- bean contrasts sharply with contemporaneous behav- ior on the Atlantic coastal plain of North America. Much of the above work was done in cooperation with the Florida State Museum, with a report submit- ted by Elizabeth J. Reitz (U Ga). BAHAMAS. The College Center of the Finger Lakes, Bahamas Archaeological Project (CCFL/BAP) reports several sites excavated and others recorded in the Bahama Islands. In January, 1983, Richard Rose (Rochester New York Museum of Science), working out of the CCFL field station, continued excavations at the Pigeon Creek site on the east coast of San Sal- vador Island. Pottery recovered included Palmetto Ware and trade sherds, the latter probably from the Greater Antilles. Also working out of the CCFL San Salvador Field Station, Charles A. Hoffman (Northern Arizona U) and John Winter (Molloy College), began excavations in June, 1983 at the Long Bay prehistoric site on the west coast of the south end of the Island. The site was se- lected for excavation because of the possibility that Christopher Columbus landed on the west coast of San Salvador on October 12, 1492. Finding European trade artifacts in association with aboriginal materials might help provide a long-sought chronological anchor for the elusive Palmetto Ware pottery so widely distrib- uted throughout the Bahamas. Excavations to date have produced midden material, including Palmetto Ware ceramics, but no European trade goods. Winter also excavated the first recorded mass Indian burial on the island of New Providence. The skeletal remains were located in a sink hole. On Great Abaco, Winter located evidence of a coastal settlement, in- cluding Palmetto Ware. This is the first time this pot- tery has been recorded from the northern Bahamas. A CCFL/BAP archaeological survey was initiated on Long Island by William Keegan (UCLA) and Steven Mitchell (California State, Bakersfield). It resulted in the location of several prehistoric sites, including an apparently extensive village at Miller's Bay on the northern end of the Island. MONTSERRAT, BARBUDA, and ANTIGUA. An interdisciplinary research team including David R. Watters (Carnegie Museum), David W. Steadman, Ronald I. Crombie, and James Dean (Smithsonian In- stitution), Gregory K. Pregill (San Diego Natural His- tory Museum), and Cathy L. Watters, conducted field- work in the Lesser Antilles in January and February 1983, examining prehistoric sites on Montserrat and Barbuda as well as the Indian Creek site on Antigua. The team also investigated paleontological specimens from cave deposits, and collected birds, reptiles, am- phibians, and mammals for comparative osteological purposes. Of particular interest to the team are questions con- cerning the extinction of, and the introduction of, species during aboriginal occupation of the Lesser Antilles. Preliminary analysis of vertebrate remains from Wat- ter's 1979 excavations indicates that numerous species, now extinct, existed contemporaneously with prehis- toric human populations of these islands. The faunal materials secured in January have increased the num- ber and variety of species represented in the sites. Ced- ric Osborne and Bert Wheeler of the Montserrat Na- tional Trust, Desmond Nicholson of the Antigua Archaeological Society, and Hilborne Frank of the Bar- buda Council provided cooperation and assistance that greatly facilitated the fieldwork. Funds were provided by the respective museums and the National Science Foundation. Charles A. Hoffman AMAZON BASIN AND EASTERN BRAZIL BRAZIL. Amazonas. Work on the Rio Negro be- tween Airao Novo and the mouth of the Ararirra was carried out in 1978 by Mario F. Simoes, Ana Lucia Machado and Ana Lucia Maroja (Museo Paraense Emilio Goeldi). Both margins of the river and the mouths of tributaries were surveyed, revealing 19 sites in Amazonas and one in the territory of Roraima. Ma- terial collected permits the recognition of five new phases (Samambaia, Manauaca, Quemacubau, Cuaru and Unini). One site contained material described by Simoes as the Apuaf phase, while two others were historically-recorded villages. Seven sites of the Sa- mambaia phase were principally on the right margin of the Negro between Airao Velho and the Jauaperi River. The phase is defined by well-finished utility ware with rounded, carinated and hemispherical forms hav- ing flat bases and flanges below the lip. Decoration includes polychrome painting, slipping, incision, ex- cision and modeling. Stone knives, scrapers, burins, punches, choppers, grinders and polished adz and ax blades occur. Two C- 14 dates were obtained. The mid- dle third of the sequence relates to 730 ? 65 B.P. (SI- 4054), while the upper third corresponds to 625 + 60 B.P. (SI-4053). It is estimated that the phase extends from 950 to about 600 B.P. The Manauca phase has been identified in seven sites located along the right margin of the Rio Negro between Airao Velho and Barcelos. It, too, has characteristic ceramics, but fewer stone tool types than the Samambaia phase. One C- 14 sample corresponding to the lower third of the seriated sequence provides an age of 1070 ? 70 B.P. (SI-4055). Simo6es believes the phase dates between 1,250 and 1,000 years ago. Three phases have each been identified at one site on the basis of distinctive artifacts. The Quemacubau phase has been identified on Lake Quemacubau near the mouth of the Cuiuni River, an affluent of the right bank of the Rio Negro. Rounded hemispherical vessels with flat bottoms are common. Decoration includes bichrome and polychrome painting and various surface 185</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY treatments. No C- 14 dates are available for this phase, but the estimated age is 1050 B.P. The Cuaru phase has also been identified on the left margin of the Rio Negro between the mouths of the rivers Xufari and Demeni. Vessel forms are rounded and hemispherical with flat bottoms. A C-14 sample dates the base of the sequence to 960 ? 90 B.P. (SI- 4057). The Unini phase is identified in a site located on the right margin of the Unini River near the juncture with the Rio Negro. Pottery includes rounded, hemispher- ical bowls, and plates with erect or inclined sites and flat bottoms. The Unini phase is believed to date ca. 1000 B.P. The Manauaca and Samambaia phases are related to the Guarita subtradition of the Polychrome tradi- tion, while Quemacubau, Cuaru and Unini are inde- pendent local developments unlike any known in the Amazon until now. Sim6es reports that another research project of the Programa Nacional de Pesquisas Arque6ologicas Na Ba- cia Amazonica (PRONAPABA) was carried out in 1979 on the lower Uatuma from the town of Urucara to the mouth of the Bacabuda and the lower courses of the affluents, Maripa and Jatapu. Participants included Sim6es, Conceicao G. Correa, Maroja and Nasser. Twenty-one sites were found and investigated. Anal- ysis of the material has permitted the identification of three phases: Urucara, Jatapu and Uatuma, as well as a historical site related to a group known in the chron- icles as the Aruaquis. Another site has two distinct components; the lower component relates to the Jatapu phase while the upper one is typical of the Guarita subtradition. The phases, Urucara and Jatapu, are re- lated to the Incised Punctate tradition and are probably contemporary. Hemispherical vessels with flat bottoms and the range of decorative techniques (fine incised, red and/or black painted on white, red polished, wide incised, incised and punctated, modeled and brushed) are similar in both phases. One C-14 age of 1030 ? 75 B.P. (SI-5089) from the lower level of site AM-UR- 10 permits an estimate of 1100 to 750 B.P. for the Jatapu phase. Comparisons suggest that the Urucara phase dates between 1050 and 950 B.P. Both phases show intrusive ceramic materials from adjacent areas, suggesting contact with groups accessible by water. The Uatuma phase is characterized by its ceramics, including many grooved grinders made from sherds, burial practices and stone tools including quartzite grooved grinders. Secondary burial occurred in an- thropomorphic and simple painted urns. Two C-14 dates place the phase between 1750 and 1050 B.P. One from AM-UR-2 (Invernada) is 1650 ? 95 B.P. (SI- 5086), the other from AM-UR-7 (Tabocal) is 1135 ? 75 B.P. (SI-5087). The Uatuma phase shows some sim- ilarity to the Guarita subtradition, but some features, such as the great variety of punctation, are foreign to Guarita. Because of the many punctated types present at some sites on the Urubu River and Silves Lake area, Sim6es proposes a new regional tradition called Saraca. A typical phase belonging to this new regional tradition is the Taperebatuba phase which was previously iden- tified by Sim6es and Machado at four sites on the northern margin of Lake Silves. This tradition also appears to be affiliated with the Poc6 phase excavated by Peter and Klaus Hilbert in 1980 at two sites on the rivers Nhamunda and Trombetas. In 1980 Sim6es, Maroja and Daniel F. Fr6is Lopes were funded by Programa de Tr6pico Umido to carry out research on both banks of the central Urubu River from Silves Lake (Saraca) to the island of Sucuriju at the entrance to Lake Glo6ria. Of 23 sites located, 18 were on the Urubu, three were on the lower Aneba River, one at the mouth of the Caru River and another on Lake Aibu. With the exception of AM-IT-31 (Ca- retas), a ceremonial site with many pictographs, all were habitation sites. The material collected has not been totally analyzed but there is evidence of two phas- es: one appears to belong to the Saraca regional tra- dition; the other may be related to an ancient local group. C- 14 dates are not yet available. Field research was carried out in 1981 by Simoes and Fr6is Lopes on the lower and middle Madeira from the juncture with the Amazon to the mouth of the Manicor&amp; River. The lower courses of the tributaries, Canuma, Aripuana and Manicore were also investi- gated. Of 31 sites located, 20 were on the right margin and 10 on the left. One site was found on the Manicore River. Constant planting and other human activities have practically destroyed 22 of 31 sites. Two sites, AM-CR-7 (Urucurituba) and AM-CR-10 (Axinim) show evidence of urns. One of these with a quadruped base resembled anthropomorphic urns of the Guarita subtradition. Although material is still being studied and analyzed, evidence of the Guarita tradition exists. Some sites appear to be more related to the Incised Punctate tradition, while still others appear to belong to distinctive local traditions. Para. The lower Tocantins project was begun in 1976 in the two areas between Maraba and Santa Terezinha do Tauari and between Tucurui and Nazare dos Patos. Research was carried out by Sim6es, Eneida Ch. Ma- lerbi and Fernanda de Araujo-Costa (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi). A total of 40 sites have been located and studied along the lower Tocantins and its tribu- taries since 1976. With the exception of one quarry, all are habitation sites. Analysis has revealed four phas- es (Tauari, Tucurui, Taua and Maraba). The Tauari phase with six sites between Maraba and Jatobal is characterized by utilitarian ceramics, axes, pounders, and knives (projectile points are rare), and secondary burials in urns. One date of 400 ? 70 B.P. (SI-4058) was from the lower third of the seriated se- quence. Tucurui phase material was recovered from 21 sites between Capitariquara and the town of Tu- curui. Elaborate ceramics, primary burials and stone artifacts similar to those of the Tauari phase can be dated to 950 ? 70 B.P. (SI-4061) at the Montanha site (PA-BA- 1). This relates to the lower third of the ser- iated sequence. The Taua phase has been identified at five sites lo- cated between Tucurui and Joana Peres on the lower Tocantins by very elaborate pottery and abundant stone artifacts, including blades of polished and pecked stone axes. The Maraba phase was identified in three sites lo- cated on the right margin of the Tocantins at Maraba. The Tauari, Tucurui and Maraba phases show different 186 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH degrees of influence from the Tupiguarani tradition of the Brazilian coast while the Tauf phase is more typical of the Incised Punctate tradition of the Amazon. Anna Roosevelt (Museum of the American Indian) is leading an archaeological project to Maraj6 Island, with funding from the National Science Foundation and the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas. Collaborating with her in the project are: Jose Seixas Lourenco, a geophysicist and Director of the Goeldi Museum, and Jane Buikstra (Northwestern U). The project, sched- uled for August to October 1983 and 1984, will include remote sensing geophysical survey and stratigraphic excavation at a Marajoara phase site. The purpose of the work is to map and excavate major archaeological features, emphasizing the collection of carbonized plant remains, animal bone, and human bone for osteolog- ical and chemical analysis. Bahai. Maria de Conceicao de Moraes Coutinho Bel- trio (Museu Nacional, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro) and Tania Andrade Lima (Museu Nacio- nal) carried out work in the Municipio de Central of the middle and lower Rio Sao Francisco. The area has a semi-arid climate and a caatinga vegetation consist- ing of cactus, bromeliads and deciduous thorny trees and bushes. The great richness of archaeological and paleontological materials has brought together the re- search efforts of physicists, geologists, paleontologists and anthropologists. Many caves in the limestone and quartzite Serie Bambui formation contain pictographs as well as bones of extinct Pleistocene animals (Ere- motherium, Haplomastodon and Hoplophorus). Work is being carried out to demonstrate the contempor- aneity of humans with these animals. In order to count- er arguments of secondary deposition, the researchers are looking for articulated human remains associated with extinct animals. The researchers believe a savan- nah corridor linked this area with the Andes prior to 13,000 years ago. Recent studies of bird and butterfly populations support the existence of such corridors where tropical forests exist today. Analysis of the pic- tographs is expected to reveal cultural connections with Minas Gerais, Piaui and Goias as well as some local and individual patterns. In order to obtain absolute dates at the cave sites, Jacques Danon (Centro Brasil- eiro de Pesquisas Fisicas) is studying the use of ther- moluminescence dating. The Central Project receives support from the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvi- mento Cientifico e Tecnolo6gico (CNPq). Collaborators include Alan Bryan and Ruth Gruhn (U Alberta), and Wesley Hurt (U Indiana). Minas Gerais. Ondemar Dias (Instituto Arqueologia Brasileira) reports on research on the caves of Minas Gerais, sponsored by the CNPq and the Smithsonian Institution. This work is coordinated by Dias and Eliana Carvalho (Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira/IAB). Paulo Seda (field director) initiated excavations in Feb- ruary on the site of Boqueirao Soberbo (MG-VG- 11). Rock paintings have been fully documented in the sec- tion of the site known as "Caverna," and field survey in the area has revealed three new sites with poly- chrome paintings (MG-VG-23,24 and 25). These sites have been partially destroyed leaving little possibility of systematic excavations. A second field survey is being carried out by Dias, Carvalho and Seda in the region of Buen6polis. Six sites have been recorded with pictographs (MG-VG- 3,4,5,6,7 and 8). Generally this is an area containing few caves and rock shelters with little significant oc- cupation debris. A third project carried out by IAB involves the sal- vage of sites MG-GV-77 and 78 located in the mu- nicipality of Pouso Alegre. Site 77 pertains to the Bel- vedere phase of the Tupiguarani tradition; 78 is of an undefined Neo-Brazilian tradition. Rio de Janeiro. Dias, Carvalho and Seda also re- ported that the Litoral Fluminense program continued salvage work on site RJ-JC-76 located in Sao Vicente, a town on the central coast. One urn burial of the Sernambitiba phase of the Tupiguarani tradition (eigh- teenth or nineteenth century) was excavated. Current Research (American Antiquity 48: 174) incorrectly stated that Pedro Ignacio Schmitz carried out work on RJ-JC-15; Dias and Carvalho are the directors at that site. Goids. Pedro Ignacio Schmitz, Altair Sales Barbosa, Avelino Fernandes de Miranda, Maria Belberi Ribeiro, Luis Eurico Moreira and four students returned to Ser- ran6polis to complete the Paranaiba project. Three cul- tures have been recognized (Paranaiba 11000-9000 B.P., Serran6polis after 9000 B.P. and Jatai after 1000 B.P.). Research is designed to discover why so many sites are located on this small piece of coast, and how the inhabitants used the environment. Also of interest is the association of the abundant rock art with the excavated artifacts. Red iron pigment, which was prob- ably used to make the rock paintings, has been found in practically all levels, indicating that the art is as- sociated with all three phases. Excellent preservation of perishable materials has permitted the study of some bone tools, and other bone remains shed light on the diet of the people. Two biface projectile points, until recently unknown from this area, indicate relationships with the Lagoa Santa culture of Minas Gerais and Rio Claro of Sao Paulo. Laboratory work on the rock art, environmental studies, and the study of animal re- mains and ceramic materials is progressing well. Work continued on the Serra Geral project in the Sao Francisco River basin, between the states of Goias and Bahia. A C-14 age of 7170 ? 65 B.P. (SI-5566) was obtained from a shallow site on the bed of the Corrente River where material resembling the Para- naiba phase was found. A second sample (8860 ? 115 B.P. [SI-5565]) relates to a limestone cave with pic- tographs. Results of the Alto-Tocantins, Alto-Araguaia I and Medio-Tocantins I projects have been published by Schmitz, et al. in Pesquisas Antropologia (No. 33, 1982). Also published by Barbosa, et al. is the "Monte do Carmo, GO. Phase Ceramica Pindorama" in Pesquisas Antropologia No. 34. Pesquisas Antropologia No. 32 contains a synthesis of Brazilian Archaeology.

Uch6a and Caio Del Rio Gar- cia (Universidad de Sao Paulo) have completed an inventory of sites along the southern coast of Sao Paulo. Of the 107 sambaquis investigated, 46 are on the main- land, 59 on several islands, and 2 on Ararapira Chan- nel. Radiocarbon dates for 27 of the sites range between 5,170 and 92 years ago. COLOMBIA. Angela Andrade (Fundacion de In- vestigaciones Arqueologicas Nacionales del Banco de Repfiblica) and Pedro Botero (Centro Interamericano de Fotointerpretacion) carried out research on the an- thropic soils (terra preta) around the small town of Araracuara on the left bank of the Caqueta. The Ca- queta flows from the Colombian Andes and has a rel- atively high biological productivity. The availability of considerable fish, and its position on a route of access between the Andes and the tropical forest, gives the Araracuara area special importance. The aim has been to discover archaeological characteristics of the soils and their phosphorus content in order to know the kind and intensity of human activities which produced them. Several test excavations were made in a 26-ha area of anthropic soils with a maximal depth of 120 cm. Two soil types were identified. One area of 6 ha consisted of 100 to 120 cm of very dark soil corresponding to 10YR 2/2-2/1 on the Munsell color chart, with a high frequency of sherds and stone tools in it. A second 20- ha area of brown earth was only 50 to 60 cm deep. Its lighter color corresponded to Munsell color 10YR 3/2-4/2.5, and it sometimes lacked cultural material. Several distinct phases are represented. Ceramics re- lated to the Camani phase were found in site 26, and C- 14 ages are expected to be around 1850 to 1750 B.P., as similar material excavated by Warwick Brey (U London) at a nearby site has an age of ca. 1815 B.P. (Revista Colombiana de Antropologfa, no. 23, 1980- 1981. In the upper levels of site 26 only ceramics of the Nofurei phase were found. Nofurei pottery has great variety of form and decoration and has been associated with the Amazonian Polychrome tradition, dated be- tween 1150 and 350 B.P. Site 29 contained no cultural material but the soil has the same characteristics as site 26. This soil does not seem to be the result of natural processes. A study of phosphorous content of the anthropic soils of Araracuara shows that content varies in horizontal and vertical directions suggesting differences in kind and intensity of human activities. The research establishes that the black earth is the result of an accumulation of refuse near houses, while brown earth appears to relate to relatively permanent farming sites fertilized with organic remains. VENEZUELA Jose R. Oliver (IVIC; U Illinois-Ur- bana) provided the information for this summary of Venezuelan work. Zulia. Research in the Maracaibo Basin area is being developed by the Instituto Venezolano de Investiga- ciones Cientificas (IVIC) and the Programa de Ar- queologia de Rescate of CORPOZULIA. The latter represents the first formal salvage project funded by semi-private corporations in Venezuela. It has con- centrated in the regions of the Guasare and Socuy rivers and Venezuelan Guajira. In 1981 Rancho Peludo was re-excavated by V. Nufiez Regueiro and associates (CORPOZULIA). Because of intensive mining oper- ations in the area, Nufiez Regueiro suspected high coal contamination of materials previously used to date the site. Over 50 radiocarbon and 15 thermoluminescence dates obtained from five units demonstrate that Ran- cho Peludo dates to about 1450 to 1350 B.P. All units show a stratigraphic discontinuity between the assem- blage of Rancho Peludo and the Guasare components which post-date 950 B.P. Two other sites of Rancho Peludoid style, Macomite on the Guasare River and La Doncella on the Cachiri River were excavated by Nufez Regueiro. All these Rancho Peludoid sites are characterized by complex burial urns, and specific dec- orative and morphological ceramic characteristics. This research will soon be published by CORPOZULIA. Erika Wagner and Lilliam Arvelo (IVIC) are ana- lyzing materials excavated in the Rio Palmar area of the Sierra de Perija. Sites include Berlin, Cafno Pescado, San Martin and El Diluvio. They hope to define the complex which combines cultural features of the in- termediate area and tropical forest. Wagner and Arvelo are also conducting a survey in the eastern Maracaibo area as part of a long-range project and have concluded an analysis of the Tortolitas complex (ca. 2000 B.P.). Tortolitas corresponds stylistically with the La Pitia, Hato Nuevo and Lagunillas complexes. Unlike Rancho Peludoid sites located on flood plains, Tortolitoid com- plexes are found along smaller tributaries. Kay Tarble (IVIC) has also recently published on stylistic corre- spondences between the Lagunillas complex and Santa Ana style of the Andes. Falcon. Research in this area is being conducted by the Centro de Investigaciones Antropologicas, Arque- lologicas y Paleontologicas (CIAAP) of the Universi- dad Francisco de Miranda and Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV). Jose M. Cruxent (CIAAP) reports the presence of artifacts worked with the Levallois tech- nique at the Paleoindian sites of Saladillo, Falcon, and also at La Casona in Panama. J. R. Oliver (CIAAP) has also located artifacts showing Levallois techniques at Eroita-2 in Falcon, and believes these occurrences of this technique to be a case of parallel convergence. Preliminary tests made by Cruxent at El Pesquero (Pen- insula of Paraguana) have uncovered a non-lithic Pa- leoindian complex with possible artifacts of fossilized Ostrea with man-made breaks. A sample of the shell is being dated by C-14. Cruxent has also located a disturbed Paleoindian site (El Pizarral) with shale and slate tools identical to the Tupuken complex of the Guayana area. J. R. Oliver finished a regional survey in the coastal plains and piedmont of western Falcon and Paraguana Peninsula, surveying and testing at the Supidebo-Borojo, Middle-Lower Maticora River, Tu- cua-Eroita, Isthmus and Coro, Santa Ana-Paraguana and Cumarebo sub-areas. The project is concerned with cultural, historical and ecological processes of the pro- to-Caquetio cultures (i.e., Dabajuroid series). New styles that encompass the major local variants of the former Dabajuro style have been defined on the basis of over 60 sites and assemblages. The Dabajuroid of Falcon evidences a process of regionalization and complex subsistence specialization. It is suspected that the im- poverished ceramic sites of the coast result from pot- 188 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH tery traded for maritime products from larger settle- ments inland. There is no evidence in Falc6n of Dabajuroid assemblages prior to Period IV (950 to 450 B.P.). The sites of Pueblo Nuevo, Santa Ana (Cha- muriana), Moruy and Machuruca (Paraguana) evi- dence reutilization of Paleoindian tools. A flaked lithic industry survived in Falc6n until late in the sixteenth century. Two new styles have been defined: Coy-Coy and San Felix de Mauroa, neither of which belongs to any known archaeological series. Coy-Coy style is known from M. A. Perera's (UCV) surface collection at the cave of Coy- Coy in the Sierra de San Luis and by stratigraphic tests of G. Pittevil (UCV) and Perera. A Coy-Coy compo- nent has also been located at El Manglar near Cuma- rebo by J. R. Oliver. On the coast it is associated with Dutch eighteenth-century porcelain and Dabajuroid and late Tocuyanoid ceramics, while at Coy-Coy it appears with Dabajuroid and Tierroid ceramics. Neither site was a permanent settlement. The other new style, San Felix de Mauroa, located in the mud-flats along the coastal llanos west of the Maticora River is character- ized by tubular bottlenecks, ollas with outsloping rims with lip nicking, open bowls with thickened lips and other bowls with flange-like lips. Brown-on-white paint, red slip, finger pressing and applique are present. The only known site was a camp destroyed by erosion in 1982. Cruxent and N. J. Mathews (CIAAP) completed three years of ethnohistorical research on traditional potters of Falc6n. Six major centers of production are defined, each with distinctive stylistic features. Contemporary sites as well as nineteenth-century sites were studied. In all the centers there is evidence of Dabajuroid sur- vivals. Ordinary domestic ware survived; serving wares and specialized forms were discontinued. Lara. UCV, the Museo Arqueolo6gico de Quibor and the Municipio del Tocuyo are responsible for the cur- rent research. M. I. Toledo and Luis Molina (Museo Arqueolo6gico de Quibor) assisted by Mario Sanoja (UCV) are excavating the cemetery of Quibor (Tierroid series), testing the hypothesis of A. Lucena (Univer- sidad de Los Andes) claiming evidence for the presence of pygmies. Preliminary results indicate many of the skeletons are children, and there is a lower than average stature, but no indication of a pygmy race. The team also indicated finding a high percentage of abnormally large crania, probably due to hydrocephalia. Pedro Linares (Municipality of El Tocuyo) has car- ried out salvage work within the city of El Tocuyo. A large number of Tocuyanoid and Tierroid burials re- covered are still under study. Aragua. An interdisciplinary research project spon- sored by the UCV has carried out excavations at Puerto Maya and El Chuao on the Central Coast. Isnirida Alvarez and Josefina Casella are analyzing ceramic and subsistence data from Puerto Maya. Fulvia Nieves (UCV) and students Patricia Morales and Gisela Pit- tevil are analyzing El Chuao materials which show re- lationships with both the Dabajuroid series and the Valencioid series. Most of the ceramics appear to be of a local style. Associations suggest a Period IV (950 to 450 B.P.) placement for El Chuao. Orinoco. Iraida Vargas (UCV) has published her Par- mana research on the Middle Orinoco (Investigaciones Arqueol6gicas en Parmana, Biblioteca de la Academia Nacional de la Historia, Monografias y Ensayos No. 20, Caracas, 1981). New evidence on the Cedefioid series from the multicomponent site of Aguerito is soon to be published in the Journal of Field Archaeology, in a report by Alberta Zucchi and Kay Tarble (IVIC). Their data contrast with data previously published by Anna Roosevelt (Museum of the American Indian). Their research suggests that the area is more complex than previously suspected. Erika Wagner (IVIC) reports that an agricultural group using ceramics may have lived in pile dwellings on the lower Orinoco Delta 1,000 to 500 years ago. Evidence recovered from the site of Mora located in the lower Central Delta supports this interpretation. The site consists of an artifact-bearing stratum eroding from a cano bank. A small collection made by Barbara Voor- hies (U California, Santa Barbara) in 1980 contained pottery which shows the fusion of the Arauquoinoid and Barrancoid traditions. The presence of clay grid-- dles and a fragment of a metate suggest use of tubers and grains. Other relationships can be established with the Guayabitoid series of eastern Venezuela, the Kras- ky style of the Los Roques Archipelago, with the pro- tohistoric pottery from Trinidad belonging to periods 3 and 4 of the local chronology, and with the Taruma phase in Guyana. No absolute dates are available but on stylistic grounds, Mora could date between 1000 and 1500 A.D. A report of these finds by B. Voorhies, E. Wagner and Lilliam Arvelo (IVIC) is currently in press in the journal Antropologica. J. R. Oliver also reports that a 1982 version of Cru- xent and Rouse's publication, Arqueologfa Chronolo- gica de Venezuela, has been completely reedited in Spanish by Armitano, Caracas. It is also reported that Fulvia Nieves (President) and V. Nufiez Regueiro (Sec- retary) are the newly elected officers of the Asociaci6n Venezolana de Arqueologia (AVA). Headquarters are located in the Department of Anthropology, (IVIC), Box 1827, Caracas. The first Boletfn Informative will be published, with original research papers and book reviews, in 1983. Of importance to historical archaeology is J. M. Cruxent's new monograph on European and American mayolica found in Venezuelan and other New World contexts. The Universidad Nacional Experimental Francisco de Miranda and CIV will soon publish the complete results of the Taima-Taima excavations in the series Paleoindian Investigations. Ronald L. Weber SOUTHERN CONE ARGENTINA. Northeast. Maria Amanda Caggi- ano (Museo Arqueolo6gico, Chivilcoy) reports the first radiocarbon ages for Prehispanic sites of the Parana delta region. All derive from shell analysis, and pertain to one preceramic site, Isla Lechiguanas- 1 (2740 ? 80 B.P., 2550 ? 90 B.P. [INGEIS-1999 and 2000]), and two ceramic sites: Don Santiago (1300 + 80 B.P., 1090 ? 80 B.P. [INGEIS-2099 and 2100]) and Rodeo Viejo 189</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY de la Nena (two identical dates of 1420 ? 80 B.P. [INGEIS-2101 and 2102]). With these dates and the numerous sites excavated so far, a tentative sequence has been established which poses (1) a preceramic com- plex of bone-harpoon fishers up to ca. 1000 B.C., (2) A ceramic-producing Entrerriana culture with several incised, punctate, and red-painted ceramic styles ap- pearing just before the time of Christ, which (3) ex- pands to become the Riberefios Plasticos culture around A.D. 500, with the addition of sculptured and excised complex ceramic forms, and is terminated by (4) Tu- piguarani arrival close to the time of initial Spanish occupation. Maria Carlotta Sempe de G6mez Llanes of the Uni- versidad Nacional de La Plata (UNLP) recently con- ducted excavations at sites of the Tupiguarani tradition along the Rio Uruguay in Misiones province. Habi- tations were circular (10 or more meters in diameter), and originally excavated into laterite formations to a depth of 30 to 120 cm. Associated artifacts include painted and corrugated ceramics of high quality, weights and lip plugs of fired clay, bone points, polishing and filing stones, mortars and small circular grinding stones, and perforators and lip plugs of rock crystal. Human skull bones found in hearths suggest the practice of anthropophagy. Dietary remains include bones of cer- vids, tapir, peccary, monkey, aguti, and fish such as salminus and dipnoii. Land animal bones were only of front and hind quarter sections, suggesting that ma- jor butchering was done elsewhere. The ceramics cor- respond to Cambara and Itarar&amp; styles of the Rio Pa- ranapanema in Brazil. Radiocarbon samples are yet to be processed. Jorge A. Rodriguez (Centro de Investigaciones Re- gionales, Entre Rios) reports that the Salto Grande project along the middle Rio Uruguay is in its final stage. The work has isolated six cultures: (1) Los Sauces, defined only by flaked lithics and stemmed points, es- timated age 5500 B.P.; (2) La Paloma, characterized by a variety of flaked and polished stone artifacts, in- cluding bolas and grinding stones, 4500 B.P.; (3) Rio Uruguay, also preceramic, with stone points and bi- faces; (4) Salto Grande, with incised and painted ce- ramics, bone harpoons, punches and points, evidence of fishing, hunting and collecting, C-14 ages between 2400 and 800 B.P.; (5) Cerro Chico, with intensive shell fishing and hunting, bone instruments, ceramics, and flaked and polished stone, C- 14 ages between 1600 and 900 B.P.; (6) Tupiguarani, with ceramics post- dating A.D. 1300. A second project begun at the end of 1982 involves survey and excavation of Tupiguarani and aceramic sites along the upper Rio Uruguay in Missiones and Corrientes provinces. Points found at the aceramic sites appear to be of great antiquity. Northwest. Beatriz N. Ventura's (Centro Argentino de Etnologia Americana) excavations at the stratified cemetery site of Manuel Elordi in the hilly woodlands of Salta province at the confluence of the Bermejo and San Francisco rivers have produced large urns con- taining human remains, as well as primary burials. Burial accompaniments include beads of turquoise and probably azurite, as well as copper items and ceramics which are generally smoothed red coarse wares with vertical and horizontal handles. Shells of Stropho- cheilus sp. are also present. One of the burial urns was radiocarbon dated at 1030 ? 120 B.P. (GaK-9900), and denoted a cultural unit younger than expected. Ventura is also studying unpublished materials ob- tained by Osvaldo Menghin in 1952 at the cemetery site of El Talar, which is near the Manuel Elordi site. Materials from the two sites are very similar, and both are distinct from the Candelaria and San Francisco complexes which had been reported earlier for the zone. Definition of a new cultural complex may thus result from the research. In the same sub-Andean environment, but in Jujuy province, Bernard Dougherty (UNLP) is continuing research southeast of the Sierra de Sanata Barbara. Near the historic fortress of El Fuerte there is a large San Francisco complex site, defined as a pair of low mounds with early ceramic occupation, covering ca. 3.5 ha. The cultural remains suggest the site may belong in the earliest part of the San Francisco sequence, ca. 850 B.C. One flexed adult human burial was found, with no accompanying artifacts. A tapir skull and leg bone were buried separately in a ceramic urn. During 1982, Hugo D. Yacobaccio of the Univer- sidad de Buenos Aires (UBA), undertook several proj- ects in the northern puna region of Jujuy province. One of these began excavation of the Taranta-1 rock shelter near Casabindo, revealing three occupation lay- ers of ceramic-producing groups. The ceramics are pri- marily plain gray or brown, but some sherds are ex- terior red-slipped and either smoothed or polished. One sherd from the lowest layer is mica tempered, a trait characteristic of early ceramics at other puna sites. The same layer yielded the base of a small lanceolate point similar to some found at the nearby site of Inca Cueva-7 (4080 ? 80 B.P.: T-1773), and to others re- ported by L. Nuiiez for the Puripica Complex of north- ern Chile. Fractured rib and long bones of camelids, apparently opened for marrow extraction, are common in all layers. A second project of Yacobaccio, with Carlos A. As- chero, was further excavation of the Inca Cueva-4 site, which gave an initial C-14 age of 9230 ? 70 B.P. (CSIC-498). The more recent excavations show the occupation extended earlier than a circular habitation found in the 1977-1978 field season, with trash pits and remains of a wild root tuber, "soldaque" (H1vso- charis tridentata), used as a food source. The micro- scopic study of lithics with adhered remnants of ca- melid skin suggests association with the circular struc- ture and the working of small pieces of skin which had been smeared with grease and dried with ash. Yacobaccio is also studying rock art in the region. The high visibility of certain petroglyph motifs and their proximity to Prehispanic records suggest their association with llama caravans. Two geographic con- centrations have been isolated, at the Casabindo area and the northern Quebrada de Humahuaca; both date to the latter part of the Later Period (A.D. 1300 to 1480). Jose A. Cocilovo of the Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto, with Maria A. Bordach, has undertaken detailed analysis of the Casanova collection of human skeletal remains from the Tilcara site in the Quebrada de Humahuaca. As was done with a study recently 190 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH completed with Osvaldo Mendonca for the Aguas Ca- lientes collection from Cochinoca (Argentina puna), findings will be related to numerous Andean localities in a comprehensive analysis of populational biological affinities (see additional item under North Chile). Rodolfo A. Raffino (UNLP), in further study of the Inca in Northwest Argentina, North Chile, and South- west Bolivia, is employing a multivariate analysis fo- cusing on architectural and other technological traits, with ethnohistoric data serving as hypothesis control. A tentative hierarchy of sites has been produced, in- cluding functional inferences. His sample includes 118 Argentine sites, 107 Chilean sites, and 25 from Bolivia. Initial results are presented in his book Los Inkas del Kollasuyu. Ana Maria Lorandi (UNLP) is also investigating Inca administrative structure and its varied manifestations in Northwest Argentina. Ethnohistoric chronicles are being scrutinized, and the Inca site of Chaquiago-Po- trero, near Andalgala, is being excavated in Catamarca province. Excavations at the site have revealed a pot- tery storage and manufacturing unit, which had pure clays, tempered clays, and clays containing a mineral giving a dark red color to the fired finished vessel. The latter was used to produce ceramics of the Famabalasto style found at the site which, with the Yocavil ceramics also present, are of Santiaguefio origin to the east. Lo- randi thus believes pottery manufacturing at the site is due to mitimaes brought by the Inca from lower elevations to the east. Nearby agricultural lands have yielded only Inca and local ceramic styles and are in- terpreted as having been worked by the native Diaguita subject to Inca m'ita labor requirements. Diana S. Rolandi de Perrot (Director, Instituto Na- cional de Antropologia) reports the activities of several researchers working through the National Institute. In 1982 Mercedes Podesta de Weschler and Daniel Oli- vera began a survey of sites, many with rock art, in the Antofagasta de la Sierra puna locality of Catamarca province. The locality was a major stopping point for various puna routes from preceramic through colonial times. Podesta is also studying rock art at two sites in the Quebrada de Numahuaca of Jujuy province: Alero de las Circunferencias and Abrigo de los Emplumados. Olivera is also studying Inca architecture in north- western Argentine provinces. Rolandi herself has two textile studies underway. One is of the material from the Inca Cueva-7 site of Jujuy province, previously dated 4130 B.P. The sec- ond, with Cecilia Perez del Micou, focuses on the tex- tiles, cordage, and basketry from Huachichocana III, Jujuy excavated by Alicia Fernandez Distel, and dated between 3450 and 1279 B.P. In another project, Perez is analyzing data relevant to plant resource exploitation for the hunter-gatherer Tehuelche and Casapedre sites at Piedra Parada, Chubut province, as well as under- taking a detailed analysis of rock art in the valley. Also noted by Rolandi is the work of Lidia Alfaro de Lanzone, begun in 1977, focusing on reconstructing the ceremonial and sociopolitical organization of the Aguada de Ambato complex of Catamarca province. Pio Pablo Diaz (director, Museo Arqueolo6gico de Cachi) indicates several Calchaqui Valley projects being carried out through his museum in Salta province. One is a joint effort by Diaz and Marta Lo Celso, involving further excavations at the Late Period village site of Tero (SSalCac 14). Lo Celso is also analyzing the ce- ramics excavated previously by Diaz and Rex Gon- zales at the Casa Morada Inca structure at the site of La Paya (SSalCac 1). In 1983, further work at the La Paya site was carried out by a team of researchers from the Universidad de El Salvador (Buenos Aires), headed by Lidia Alfaro de Lanzone and Alberto Rex Gonzales, with participation of the Cachi Museum. In other proj- ects, Martin Giesso and Marta Balan are surveying and recording sites in the northern sector of the valley ad- jacent to the puna, and Maria Delia Arena is analyzing materials excavated earlier by Diaz at the Early Period cemetery of Salvatierra (SSalCac 91). Gordon C. Pollard (State U New York [SUNY] Plattsburgh) is currently reassessing the relationship between Inca sites in Jujuy and Salta provinces and the north-south highland route utilized by the Spanish and described by Juan de Matienzo in 1566. With improved archaeological data and the more accurate maps of recent years, more precise plotting of stopping points on the route can be accomplished. A revision of the location of the route segment associated with entrance into the Calchaqui Valley is proposed, and league/kilometer correspondences between stopping points, many of which were Inca tambos, now appear more consistent and reliable than earlier researchers believed. Maria Carlota Semp&amp; de G6mez Llanes (UNLP) re- ports results from several projects in Catamarca prov- ince. One involves the Late Period Belen culture, for which Sempe has obtained a C- 14 age for the fortified site of Pucara del Cerro Colorado de La Cienaga de Abajo: 760 ? 85 B.P. (INGEIS-364). The date suggests that fortified village sites began by late Belen I/early Belin times (A.D. 1200 to 1300), earlier than previ- ously believed. Sempe also states that major changes in settlement pattern cannot be discerned for the three phases of the Belen complex, and that early hilltop villages of pithouses and coeval dispersed structures gradually increased in size and complexity through time. A second project by Sempe is the excavation of a Ci&amp;naga culture habitation site at Barrealito de Azam- pay in Belen department. This is the first complete site of this culture to be excavated in the Hualfin Valley, and contradicts earlier belief that Ci&amp;naga habitations were constructed exclusively of perishable materials. The site has three circular and rectangular stone wall structures and a large corral. Buried storage jars are present at the site, and the doorway to one structure was marked by a child burial which Sempe feels may represent an initial construction sacrifice. Lastly, Sempe has two radiocarbon determinations for habitation 1 (adobe walls) of the Palo Blanco site in Tinogasta department. The first is 1760 ? 95 B.P. (INGEIS-365) from the lowest level of the structure, and is associated with line-burnished and smoothed Black-on-Gray ceramics. The second date, from char- coal higher in the same deposits, is 1640 ? 100 B.P. (INGEIS-366) and documents the continuation of Black-on-Gray ceramic styles as well as incised types of Cienaga and Molle II influence. Structure 1 deposits thus represent ca. 200 years, which, combined with 191</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Aguada ceramics in other structures, suggest ca. 500 years of occupation for the site as a whole. West-central. J. Roberto Barcena of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo (UNC), with collaborators, is estab- lishing a cultural sequence for the ceramic/farming pe- riods of northwestern Mendoza province. Radiocarbon dates from the work so far range from A.D. 60 to 1680, from various cultural contexts. Investigations are fo- cused on two zones: the Cordillera Frontal and the puna near the Sierra de Uspallata, with particular at- tention to reconstruction of diet and paleoecology from plant remains. One of the primary species to be iden- tified so far is Tephrocactus andicola, whose fruit ap- pears to have been a low-quality consumption item. Other efforts to define the Prehispanic cultural se- quence for Mendoza province are being provided by Pablo Sacchero (UNC). One project is in the Uco Val- ley, and has involved a survey of 12 zones, plus ex- cavations at El Toro cave. Rockshelters are the primary site type. A second project is focused on five zones from Pampas Altas of the precordillera to the Cuenca del Tulumaya; present surveys and excavations have revealed preceramic, farming, and early Spanish con- tact occupations. Pampas. Gustavo G. Politis (UNLP), working in Buenos Aires province, notes further findings for the Arroyo Seco-2 Paleoindian site. There he has verified the association oflithic flakes and unifacially retouched tools with Pleistocene megafauna (megatherium, my- lodon, horse, macrochenia). Fourteen articulated hu- man skeletons have also been excavated at the site, probably pertaining to the megafauna level. A second project has initiated re-excavation of the La Moderna site, which previously yielded crystalline quartz flakes in association with Doedicurus and Sclerocalvptus. New finds so far have been only of unidentified bones. A third site excavated by Politis is Zanj6n Seco-2, with a complex of ceramics, grinding stones, unifacial quartzite tools and guanaco bones, lacking projectile points. The site is estimated to date a few centuries prior to Spanish arrival, and may be roughly contem- porary with the Zanj6n Seco-3 sites, which has yielded concentrations of discarded guanaco and deer bones. The sites are seen as important in documenting rela- tively late nomadic and semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer groups in the Pampas region. Complementary work is being done by Monica Salemme (UNLP), who has be- gun a multidisciplinary study of Holocene and historic mammal distribution and utilization for Buenos Aires province. Other work in Buenos Aires province is being done by Jorge E. Carbonari (Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata). In the Tandilia zone he has been excavating a small stratified cave site, Cueva Tixi, the first in the region to yield a large quantity of lithic artifacts. Fine grained silicious sandstone is the raw material, which was flaked and retouched for a variety of unifacial scrapers. Pressure flaking is evident, but no points have yet been found. Faunal remains are abundant, includ- ing those of at least 14 species of small and large mam- mals, all post-Pleistocene and pre-Conquest. The exca- vations have been assisted by Diana Mazzanti and Marta Arana, with faunal analysis by Eduardo Tonni, and geological analysis by Francisco Fidalgo. Patagonia. Rita Ceballos (Universidad Nacional de Rosario) sends word of two projects in northern Pat- agonia. One entails excavation of a cave site along the Rio Cuyin Manzano in Neuqu&amp;n province. Its lowest component pertains to guanaco hunters with a C-14 age of 7970 ? 85 B.P. (KN.I.-432), possibly extending to 10,000 B.P. A second component is estimated to have begun ca. 5000 B.P. and includes such artifacts as stemmed triangular points, stone scrapers, knives, and grinding stones (some used for pigments), all sug- gesting relations to the Ongamira I-II, and Intihuasi II-III hunter-gatherer complexes of the Sierras Cen- trales. An early Spanish contact component is also present, representing a marked break with the previous site occupation. Artifacts include small, finely re- touched points, bola stones, ceramics, shell and bone adornments, and spindle whorls. During the summer of 1983, Ceballos also began detailed study, including infrared photography, of pet- roglyphs and pictographs at three rock shelters in Pi- chileufu Valley, Rio Negro province. Two styles have been recognized, one with naturalistic depictions of human feet and hands, feline prints, birds and guanaco; the other style is geometric, with circles, concentric circles, spirals, stepped forms, dots, etc. Cultural and chronological associations for the styles have yet to be defined, but the naturalist depictions are believed to pertain to early guanaco hunters, and the geometric motifs to late pre-conquest/early post-conquest time. Luis Alberto Borrero (UBA) reports five projects for the Patagonia regions of southern Argentina and Chile. All concern early hunting and gathering groups. He has completed the first stage of his studies along the lower Rio Limay, and is now focusing on the Piedra del Aguila zone some 100 km upstream. The project is directed by Sanguinetti under a joint agreement be- tween UBA and the Hidronor Dam construction com- pany, and involves surveys begun in March 1983. Re- sults will be compared with findings from the lower Rio Limay. A second project, also directed by San- guinetti, is in the Rio Chico basin of Santa Cruz prov- ince, just south of the Rio Gallegos which was studied previously. The Rio Chico environment is dominated by basaltic outcrops in a steppe setting, and excavations have been initiated in caves used as campsites for hunt- ing guanaco. Occupations are similar to those recog- nized by J. Bird at Palli Aike (preceramic, Period IV). A third project by Borrero produced a model of the occupation of the Seno de la Ultima Esperanza region of Magallanes, Chile, and poses a north-to-south movement along the continental divide from autumn to spring, and east-to-west movements during the sum- mer, the latter involving the pursuit of marine birds and mammals, primarily by canoe Indians. The model takes into account the environmental changes docu- mented in the last 14,000 years by the rich remains of Mylodon Cave. In spring of 1983, Borrero began surveying a band of territory 10 to 20 km inland from, and parallel to, the coast of the Golfo de San Jorge, Chubut. A major objective is to define relations between coastal and inland occupations and to pinpoint the source of stone used for retouched tools found on the coast. Victoria 192 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT RESEARCH Horwitz and Lidia Garcia are assisting in study of ce- ramics collected from along the bay. Lastly, Borrero has excavated three sites on the northern section of Isla Grande of Tierra del Fuego, at Punta Maria. Study is also continuing of materials from Selk'nam territory, including the totally excavated site of Bloque Erraitico 1, which was a guanaco processing site. This is the first such site to be discovered for extreme southern South America, with a radiocarbon age of 785 ? 120 B.P. derived from guanaco bone collagen. Selk'nam adaptations are of particular inter- est since this group is one of the few hunter-gatherer societies of Patagonia that did not adopt the horse. Hugo Yacobaccio is in charge of a team analyzing the function of lithic materials and the variability of non- retouched artifacts; Marcela Casiraghi is studying bone artifacts; and Borrero is concentrating on faunal re- mains. The typology of Selk'nam sites is still being redefined, and has become more complicated with the addition of environmental subdivisions. Humberto A. Lagiglia (Director, Museo de Historia Natural, San Rafael, Mendoza) reports further findings from excavations at a large habitation site of Yfmana tradition canoe Indians in Tierra del Fuego along the Beagle Channel. The coastal site has ca. 200 habitations evidenced by angular and circular depressions 3 to 6 m in diameter. One angular structure appears to be relatively recent in date, as suggested by an associated fragment of china which bears a manufacturing stamp with the legend "Crescent and Sons-George Jones and Sons-Made in England." The refuse also included large numbers of fish scales and vertebrae, gastropod mol- luscs, and bivalves. Worked lithics are also present, and one Indian burial was encountered. As for the Yamana component, circular depressions were found not to be true pit houses, but rather the result of re- peated cleaning of the interior of the structure, with refuse being accumulated primarily coastward of each unit. The fieldwork was carried out with the collabo- ration of Pablo 0. Zanola (Director, Museo Territo- rial), and Luis Sosa and others from the Museo del Fin del Mundo. Luis Abel Orquera, Arturo Emilio Sala, and Alicia Hayd&amp;e Tapia (Asociaci6n de Investigaciones Antro- polo6gicas) are also working along the Beagle Channel in Tierra del Fuego. Their fourth field season at the Tunel site, funded by the National Geographic Society, revealed three components in addition to the two com- ponents described earlier. Component 3 (4300 ? 80 B.P.: Beta-4386) is contemporary with the zone's An- tiguo de Lancha Pakewaia phase (4200 B.P.), and con- tinues the coastal maritime adaptation of the earlier Tunel component (6200-5800 B.P.). Component 4 (2690 ? 80 B.P.: Beta-2516) has a concentration of leather-working tools, and may be an intrusion into the major tradition of the site. A final component is more recent and poorly represented, but a radiocarbon age of 450 B.P. (Beta-4387) makes it contemporary with the Reciente de Lancha Packewaia phase (1580- 280 B.P.). Maria Jose Figuerero Torres (Instituto de Ciencias Antropolo6gicas, Buenos Aires), is heading the "Plan arqueolo6gico para el parque nacional Tierra del Fue- go," with Guillermo L. Mengoni Gofialons (ICA) par- ticipating as zooarchaeologist to carry out taphonomic studies of sub-antarctic forest environments. The proj- ect is a regional study of the Bahia Lapatia and its tributaries, with primary interest being the paleonu- trition of prehistoric groups occupying the ethnograph- ic Yamana area. A shell midden is being excavated in its entirety to determine site formation processes and their effect on the interpretation of seasonality data. CHILE. North. George Serracino (Conservador Patrimonio Cultural, Calama) notes a radical change in the organization of archaeological research and mu- seums in Chile. Museum ownership has now shifted from universities to municipalities, and Serracino has been named curator of museums at Calama, ChiuChiu and Caspana. His recent research includes study of the historic Topater site just outside Calama, which dates to the Pacific War of 1879. Jose A. Cocilovo (Universidad Nacional de Rio Cuarto, Argentina), F. Rothhammer, E. Llop, both Universidad de Chile (UC), and S. Quevedo (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural), report more findings in their study of human skull changes in prehispanic pop- ulations of the Azapa and Camarones valleys. Mod- eling of discontinuous traits gave results similar to those of a metric analysis, with biological separation corre- lated (r = 0.84) with temporal distance and a measur- able rate of divergence observable between populations in the two valleys over a 6,000-year time span. This type of study is now being applied to 25 populations of Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Tierra del Fue- go, and is aimed at revealing broad migratory patterns, as well as the affinities of localized groups on a micro- geographical scale. Lautaro Nufiez A. (Universidad del Norte, Antofa- gasta) in further study of both coastal and highland adaptations of Paleoindian, Archaic, and early farmer/ herder groups of northern Chile, reports special em- phasis on the upper Quebrada de Tarapaca locality. There he has isolated an early focus of complex ar- chitecture and farming (ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 800) as- sociated with interregional traffic in various resources. Data derive from two excavated village sites: Case- rones (centralized) and Pircas (dispersed). These relate to one model of sedentism based on valley zones at coastal and lower elevations with agrarian and forest exploitation (ca. 1000 B.C. to A.D. 400); a second mod- el is based on circum-puna high-elevation zones with semi-sedentary Archaic settlements and domesticated camelids, as at Puripica, by 2000 B.C. Victoria Castro R. (UC), in a joint project with Jose Berenguer R. and Carlos Aldunate S. (Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino, Santiago), reports further prog- ress in their multidisciplinary study of past and present settlement along the upper Rio Loa. For the Prehis- panic period, focus is on the Toconce Phase (A.D. 900 to 1470) of the Atacamefio tradition, in an attempt to isolate altiplano connections and influences. Of par- ticular note is the Hedionda black-on-buff ceramic style, said to characterize the Toconce phase. The style is also associated with chullpa sites of the southern Lipez region, and extends to Omasuyo territory on the north- east border of Titicaca in Bolivia. Carlos Thomas W. and M. Antonia Benavente A. 193</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY (UC) are studying belief systems as indicators of so- ciocultural change for ceramic-producing Prehispanic groups of the middle Rio Loa zone. The focus is on small, stone "wall and box" ceremonial sites, and the snuffing complex. For the early ceramic settlement of ChiuChiu 200 (RAnL 88), studied previously by them, four sherds have now been dated in France by ther- moluminescence. They range from 2950 ? 310 to 2850 ? 260 B.P., thus confirming an early position for the Vega Alto complex and its association with pol- ished, corrugated, incised, slipped, and appliqued ce- ramics. Gast6n Castillo Gomez (Museo Arqueolo6gico de La Serena) is reassessing the El Molle culture complex (ca. A.D. 1 to 600) of the semi-arid, southern portion of northern Chile. The complex is associated with the initial use of ceramics, metals, stone smoking pipes, lip plugs, and the development of farming and herding in the region. A project in the Los Choros-Hurtado area is aimed at evaluating the transition from the Archaic to early El Molle. Two El Molle sites in the Elqui Valley have been excavated to provide further details of the complex; one is a habitation site, and the other is a possible hilltop fortification. In another project, Cas- tillo has excavated a coastal cemetery of the Las Ani- mas complex at Coquimbo (ca. A.D. 800 to 900); the work will help define the transition of El Molle to this later complex. The burials are distinguished by camelid sacrifices, with one to five camelids having been buried with an adult or child human. Burial accompaniments are abundant, including metal, wood, bone, shell, stone and ceramic artifacts. Jamie Vera Villarroel (Museo de Historia Natural de Valparaiso) sends word of results from a study of four artificially mummified humans of the Chinchorro complex of Arica, apparently excavated by Max Uhle at the beginning of the century. They include two adults and two children, the adults having been C-14 dated at 5240 + 230 B.P. (GaK-9902) and 5010 ? 110 B.P. (GaK-9903). The mummies are thus contemporary with similar ones from the site of Pisagua Viejo-4, south of Arica, which were previously dated at 4880 ? 329 B.P. and 5330 ? 170 B.P. These age determinations and others suggest a chronological gradient for the Chin- chorro complex, with a possible southward movement of peoples from the Peruvian coast. Central and South-central. A second project by Vil- larroel involves study of the Pangal-2 site in the pre- cordillera of central Chile at 1,500 m elevation. It is a transitory habitation site consisting of a series of rock shelters with subterranean interconnections. Occupa- tions range from pre-Inca to early Hispanic periods, and may pertain to ceremonial, pastoral, mining and farming activities. Archaeological remains include pet- roglyphs of Guayquivilo and Aconcagua styles, and smoothed ceramics, some with mammiform append- ages and others with oblique cross-hatched incisions. These pertain to the early ceramic period of central Chile, and are related to the Llolleo complex of the lower Rio Maipo and to sites of the Santiago basin and the upper Rio Maipo. Other finds include coiled bas- ketry, Mytilus sea shell, and a rare wooden shovel with a C-14 age of 680 ? 40 B.P. (GaK-9901); this falls in the Middle period of the region's prehistory. Villarroel has another project in central Chile. A study of the relationship between the late Archaic and the early ceramic period on the coast will strive to refine the local chronology in this transition period, and bet- ter define the spatial and temporal distribution of early ceramic styles and their inland connections. Detailed study of marine shells from various coastal sites is being undertaken to aid in dating. One of Ruben Stehberg's (Museo Nacional de His- toria Natural) present projects is a continuation of his study on past and present human occupation of the Rinconada de Huechfun near Santiago, with financing from UNESCO. About 40 sites have been located, per- taining to the Aconcagua occupation of the region, and the major village site of the group has been partially excavated. The burial mound cemetery of Huechun has also been restored and opened for tourism. A sec- ond project involves survey and mapping of 80 sites of the Card6n de Chacabuco zone and is aimed at detailing the local Prehispanic sequence. Lastly, work has been initiated in the subantarctic region of southern Chile, where important historical and ethnographic material is being recorded for Punta Arenas and Puerto Williams. In addition, two definitely aboriginal pro- jectile points, claimed to derive from the South Shet- land Islands of Antarctica, are being analyzed, and fieldwork to verify their context of discovery is un- derway. Jorge Kaltwasser, along with Alberto Medina and Juan Munizaga (Universidad de Chile, Santiago) report on their study of the Chuchipuy Paleoindian/Archaic cemetery south of San Vicente de Taguatagua in Chachapoal province. The stratified cemetery has so far revealed four layers to a maximum depth of 2.35 m. The upper layer is estimated to fall around A.D. 1000, with the lower units being preceramic. The low- est layer has lithics associated with extinct Pleistocene fauna, and a C-14 age of 8070 ? 100 B.P. (Beta-1453). The large number of well-preserved skeletons at the site, plus 12 other radiocarbon dates, leads Kaltwasser to suggest that this is one of the most important Archaic sites in the hemisphere. Along with comparable finds at Guayas in coastal Eduador, Lagoa Santa in Brazil, and Palli Aike and Cerro Sota in Patagonia, Kaltwasser believes the Chuchipuy remains support the view that major cultural changes, such as the spread of ceramics, are associated with migrations of physically distinct populations as reflected in skull configuration. The three lower components at Chuchipuy are distinguished by populations of dolichocephalic individuals (the lowest component skulls are "ultra-dolichocephalic"), where- as individuals of the upper (ceramic) period are dis- tinctively brachycephalic. While not negating the pos- sible effect of localized biological evolution, a continent- wide pattern of dolichocephalic people is suggested for terminal Paleoindian/early Archaic times. Tom D. Dillehay (U Kentucky and the Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia) in conjunction with Chilean colleagues, is studying the production and distribution of exotic ritual paraphernalia and the function and con- text of these goods in the nguillatun fertility rite that is sponsored by multiple lineages. Of particular interest is the U-shaped ceremonial field of the nguillatun, the style and meaning of iconographic design, the socio- 194 [Vol. 49, No. 1, 1984]</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT RESEARCH economic activity structure of the ceremony and the comparison of these data to the archaeological record of U-shaped ceremonial centers of the Formative pe- riod in the Central Andes. Dillehay is also beginning to excavate Prehispanic nguillatun fields and burial mounds in order to document the time depth of the ceremonies in south-central Chile and eventually to analyze the Formative period from a more compara- tive position in the Andes. In another project, begun in 1978, Dillehay and col- leagues at the Universidad Austral De Chile are com- pleting the final season of excavation at the early man occupation site of Monte Verde (12,000 to 14,000 B.P.), also located in south-central Chile. Once this research is completed, our present understanding of the lifeway of forest-dwelling late Pleistocene populations in South America, or for that matter the Americas, will be aug- mented considerably in terms of the economic struc- ture and the level of technological sophistication of early human groups.
