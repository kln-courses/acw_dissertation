<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Delaware Prophet Neolin: A Reappraisal Alfred A. Cave, University of Toledo Abstract. While there is no doubt that the prophet Neolin, in seeking to reform Delaware religious culture, drew upon ideas borrowed from EuroAmerican Chris- tians, scholars have often overlooked or understated the ways in which Neolin incorporated those ideas into an indigenous context and added elements which resonated with traditional themes. This article analyzes the interplay of traditional and alien elements in Neolin's thought. In challenging European colonial expansionism and cultural hegemony, Third World nativist revitalization movements have commonly used ideas borrowed from the dominant power. Students of those movements dis- agree as to whether the key to understanding revitalization ideology is to be found in their appropriation of Judeo-Christian concepts of providence and divine judgment or in their reaffirmation of indigenous beliefs and practices.1 It is thus not surprising that while some analyses of the Delaware (Lenape) prophets of the eighteenth century portray them as traditionalists who incorporated some borrowed ideas into an inherited body of beliefs and practices, others argue the prophets were radical innovators whose core message was grounded in concepts of sin and redemption borrowed from Christian missionaries. A classic and extreme example of the latter interpretation is found in a I97I study of the Delaware prophets which concluded that "by the mid-eighteenth century, the Delaware had inter- nalized white culture to the extent that they could no longer distinguish it from their own." Accordingly, the Delaware nativist revival could not have been "an outgrowth of indigenous tradition," but rather must be seen "as a basically European innovation expressed in native idiom." 2 This article seeks to demonstrate, through a reexamination of their Ethnohistory 46: z (spring i999) Copyright ? by the American Society for Ethnohistory.</page><page sequence="2">z66 Alfred A. Cave teachings, that those who have portrayed the religious innovations of the Delaware prophets as essentially nonindigenous not only overstate their case but also misconstrue the basic nature of the prophets' appeal. Ad- mittedly, the prophets made use of certain ideas about God and the Devil and about heaven and hell that were not only borrowed from Christianity but that, on the surface, appear to have few if any counterparts in tradi- tional beliefs. In calling for certain changes in religious practice they also sometimes echoed Christian missionaries in condemning their traditional- ist rivals as witches and devil worshippers. But preoccupation with their indebtedness to Christian teachings can too easily divert us from the more important task of placing their prophetic messages within their proper cultural context. If we are to understand these nativist revitalization move- ments, we must also seek to explain, as one recent writer points out, "why the prophetic response seemed a natural and rational one to the prophets and their followers." A vital key to the prophets' appeal is to be found in their invocation of the familiar, and in their skill in incorporating bor- rowed concepts within a nativist framework. We must therefore focus our attention on their "ability to tap all of the ambiguous power of enduring symbol and myth and ritual" by blending elements that drew on "age-old patterns" as well as those that were clearly "innovative."53 We cannot, of course, deny the influence of Christian teachings on the Delaware prophets. The issue is one of emphasis and balance. The syncretic religious movements led by postcontact revitalization prophets blended traditional and borrowed concepts and were neither purely indigenous nor "basically European" in origin. Nativist revitalization leaders, to cite Anthony F. C. Wallace's classic definition, clearly sought "the elimination of alien persons, customs, values, and/or materials from the mazeway.54 But they also sought to identify and excise elements in the traditional cul- ture which they regarded as sources of corruption, weakness, and failure, with particular attention to transgressions resulting in the presumed for- feiture of the favor of supernatural beings whose good will and benevolent intervention was so essential to individual and collective well-being. In their identification of those transgressions, the prophets often invoked reli- gious concepts and values borrowed from the same alien culture whose influence they sought to neutralize. The prophets' power came from the relevance of their teachings to the particular circumstances of their fol- lowers. The interplay of indigenous and alien elements in the prophetic message reflected very specific social needs and historical circumstances. With those considerations in mind, let us assess the role played by both indigenous and borrowed concepts in the teachings of the Delaware prophets, with particular attention to the work of Neolin. Neolin was not</page><page sequence="3">The Delaware Prophet Neolin z67 the first of the so-called Delaware prophets. But the reports we have of the teachings of his predecessors are terse and vague. Prior to Neolin, white observers paid little attention to Indian "prophets." But Neolin's claim that he had spoken to the creator himself, and had received instruction on the means to be employed "to drive the white people out of their coun- try" came to the attention of the English at a time of extreme tension on the western frontier.5 Neolin's teachings were quoted extensively by the war leader Pontiac and provided spiritual support to the nativist uprisings of I763-64. Neolin and his disciples had extensive contact with whites, and were far less secretive about their beliefs than were their predeces- sors. Hence, reports of his teachings provide us with the only reasonably comprehensive view we have of an eighteenth-century Native American prophetic movement. The Delaware prophets were the product of a century of upheaval and dislocation. Although recognized as a distinct group by both the Dutch and the English, the Delaware, more properly referred to as the Lenape or Lenni Lenape, spoke several dialects of two distinctive eastern Algon- quian languages, Munsee and Unami.6 At the time of first contact with Europeans, they possessed no cohesive tribal institutions and were not en- tirely uniform in culture. Prior to the mid-eighteenth century, they had no real identity as a "tribe" or "nation." The center of Lenape life was the village, generally inhabited by a few hundred members. Some villages were loosely linked in transitory alliances generally formed to counter an ex- ternal threat, but for the most part local autonomy prevailed. The villages were "virtually autonomous settlements probably composed of lineages and clans" which "dealt effectively with most social problems, both eco- nomic and governmental ... above the clan level there were but few poorly developed institutions."7 The Lenape homelands in the early seventeenth century were located in the Delaware Valley of New Jersey, in eastern Pennsylvania, and in south- eastern New York. Pressure from both Europeans and Indian rivals forced the Delaware westward. They suffered severe attrition from both infectious European diseases, to which they had no immunity, and from the inten- sified intergroup warfare that followed soon after trade with Europeans began. Within a few decades, alcohol also took its toll. Contemporary ac- counts spoke of both depopulation and demoralization as basic realities of Lenape life in the European colonial era. The process of western migra- tion was marked by severe disruptions in established social patterns. As one authority notes, "geographical displacement" of the various Lenape communities occurred unevenly "as small groups sold their land or were</page><page sequence="4">z68 Alfred A. Cave forced from it at various times. The scattered, decimated, and unorganized bands . . . soon gathered, or were gathered, as they had never been in pre-European times. The 'towns' that grew up in the river valleys of Penn- sylvania in the early decades of the eighteenth century were not formed from homogeneous cultural units."8 The prophetic movement had its ori- gins in those refugees villages whose inhabitants, of diverse background but with a common sense of loss, were receptive to a call to renewal. The process of dispossession and removal continued throughout the first half of the eighteenth century, as the Lenape bands in Pennsylvania lost land and were forced westward in the notorious "Walking Purchase of I737" and the Albany Purchase of I754. Many found refuge in new communities in the upper Ohio Valley.9 It is in this period of dispossession and migration that we encounter the first evidence of nativist prophetic activity among the Delaware and their Indian neighbors. In I737, Conrad Weiser learned of the teachings of a "seer" at Otseningo on the Susquehanna River who had told the wretched Shawnee and Onondaga refugees assembled there that their hunger and misery were punishments for their involvement in trade with Europeans and for their addiction to European rum. The Great Spirit, angered by their drunkenness, had driven away the game, and would "wipe them from the earth" if they did not forsake their evil collusion with aliens.10 Several years later the Moravian missionary Frederick Post learned of two other prophets in the Susquehanna Valley. A Munsee holy man named Papoo- nan called for peaceful resistance to European expansionism through the abandonment of trade with whites and the revival of "the ancient Customs &amp; Manners" of Native Americans. Papoonan taught that God was angry with Indians for becoming as greedy and materialistic as the European intruders." At a neighboring village upriver on the Susquehanna, Wangomend, the Assinisink prophet, using a chart that demonstrated that rum drinkers went to hell, preached a more militant resistance to Europeans and their ways. Post reported that Wangomend's followers assembled in emotion- ally charged mass meetings where they spoke tearfully of the "Dreams and Revelations" that had given them power and sought catharsis in frantic dancing and singing. The prophet declared himself the enemy of those who sought to teach Christian doctrine in the native American villages on the frontier. Salvation from "perdition," Wangomend declared, could come only from adherence to the "great and good spirit" who had called on Indians to renounce all innovations of European origin. Wangomend told Post's fellow Moravian missionary John Heckewelder that the Great Spirit had allowed him "to take a peep into the heavens, of which there were</page><page sequence="5">The Delaware Prophet Neolin z69 three, one for the Indians, one for the Negroes, and another for the white people. That of the Indians he observed to be the happiest of the three, and that of the whites the unhappiest; for they were under chastisement for their ill treatment of the Indians, and for possessing themselves of the land which God had given to them. They were also punished for making beasts of the Negroes, by selling them as the Indians do their horses and dogs, and beating them unmercifully, although God had created them as well as the rest of mankind." 12 The prophetic message spread throughout the Native American com- munities in Pennsylvania and the Ohio country. The Presbyterian mission- ary John Brainerd, seeking to convert the Lenape and their neighbors to the religion of Christ, complained in I75I that the villagers now boldly asserted that God had created Indians, Negroes, and whites separately, and favored people of color. The supreme being, they argued, had "given the white man a book and told him that he must worship by that, "but placed no such restriction on others. Christianity was therefore a religion for whites only, containing nothing of value for God's other peoples. Not only were whites not superior to Indians, they were morally suspect, as they had enslaved the Negroes and now plotted to take the Indians' lands "and make slaves of them and their children." Unable to win his infor- mants' trust, Brainerd could learn little about the activities of the nativist prophets who were so effectively undermining his efforts. He did hear rumors about "a revelation lately made by a young squaw in a trance," rumors that suggested opposition to the local, accomodationist Delaware leadership."3 The reports of Weiser, Post, Heckewelder, and Brainerd not only bear witness to growing nativist anger against whites but also suggest that Native American religious innovators were now using, for their own purposes, new concepts of a supreme, omnipotent, and judgmental cre- ator deity, and of heaven and hell, modeled after missionary accounts of the Christian God, concepts which they blended with traditionalist be- liefs about both the efficacy of ritual ("frantic dances and singing") and of individual vision quests ("Dreams and Revelations.") Out of the turmoil of Delaware dispossession and migration emerged new political leaders who, perhaps inspired by the prophets, forged a new sense of ethnic identity and independence in the refugee villages of the west. Driven from many of those areas in Pennsylvania where they had earlier resettled, a majority of the Lenape found refuge in the Ohio country in the I750S.14 While the Delaware were still resident in the east, the Iro- quois, with English encouragement and mixed results, had attempted to</page><page sequence="6">Z70 Alfred A. Cave deny Delaware self-determination, designating a "Half King" to supervise their affairs and hold them in a subordinate status. Iroquois intervention as enforcers for white land claimants had contributed to Delaware dispos- session, but their control over their presumed Lenape subjects was never as complete as colonial pretense and later historical myth maintained.15 In the Ohio country, as Newcomb notes, the Delaware rose "Phoenix-like, from the ashes of their subjugation and removal and ... forged themselves into a tribe that was able to defy the Six Nations and the Europeans." 16 Scarooyaday, an Oneida appointed to act as the Six Nations' "viceroy over the Ohio Delawares," had little real authority and served more as a nego- tiator than as a proconsul.17 The British soon recognized that the Iroquois had no effective control in the west. In their efforts to shore up their own influence in the Ohio country, they asked the Iroquois to designate a "King of the Delawares" with whom they might deal. Bowing to necessity, the Iroquois recognized the authority of Shingas, a Delaware sachem who had won the respect of his compatriots as a strong and independent leader. Colonial authorities came to regret the choice, for Shingas, no puppet, would soon send war parties in support of French efforts to exclude the British from the trans-Appalachian west. Some Delaware bands remain- ing in the Susquehanna Valley would also, for a time, give support to the French in the so-called French and Indian War.18 The bungling of the British major general Edward Braddock helped precipitate Delaware belligerency during that conflict. When the western Delaware chief Shingas sought guarantees of Indian rights in the Ohio country, Braddock replied that "no savage should inherit land."19 The gen- eral also haughtily declined Delaware and Shawnee offers to accompany his troops on their march against Fort Duquesne, a blunder that contrib- uted to, if it did not cause, his disastrous defeat and death at the forks of the Ohio. The British humiliation at Fort Duquesne inspired not only Delaware and Shawnee but also some Seneca and Cayuga from the Iro- quois confederation to join the French. However, French failure to provide adequate support for their Native American allies impelled both the west- ern and eastern Delaware, and other Indian belligerents, to make peace with the British before the war's end. Soon after the French capitulation, the overbearing behavior of the British victors triggered renewed Indian insurgency. Despite the warnings of seasoned Indian agents and traders such as Sir William Johnson and George Croghan, the British commander Lord Amherst ended the policy of reaffirming kinship ties with Indian allies through gift giving, condoned price increases in the Indian trade, and seized lands rightfully belonging to the Iroquois to reward some of his officers. The underlying cause of Native</page><page sequence="7">The Delaware Prophet Neolin z7I American unrest was, of course, the perception, reinforced by Amherst's bungling, that the British intended to deprive them of both their land and their dignity.20 Early efforts by an anti-British Seneca faction to organize a pan-Indian uprising failed. The Ottawa war leader Pontiac, along with other less celebrated insurgents, were more successful. The teachings of the Delaware prophet Neolin played an important role in that success. The prophet resided in Tuscarawas Town in the Ohio country during the years when Delaware refugees in the west forged a new tribal identity. Neolin's message, first reported in I762, drew upon but greatly ampli- fied the teachings of the earlier Delaware prophets. It reflected both an intensified anger against whites, particularly the British, and a commit- ment, perhaps not present in earlier prophetic messages, to a new concept of Indian solidarity that unified old antagonists and created a new racial identity. The fullest account we have of Neolin's message is contained in a re- port, written by a French resident of Detroit, of a story told by Pontiac to his followers during the siege of I763. The story described Neolin's jour- ney to heaven, his meeting with the creator of the universe (the Master of Life), and the message which the creator instructed him to carry back to his people. Neolin had learned in a dream that he must visit this supreme being. He accordingly set off equipped for "a hunting journey," carrying "provisions, and ammunition, and a big kettle." After walking eight days toward the celestial realm, "he halted at sunset, as usual, at the opening of a little prairie upon the bank of a stream that seemed to him a suitable camping place. As he was preparing his shelter he beheld at the other end of the prairie where he camped, three roads, wide, and plainly marked." Although somewhat surprised, Neolin "went on working on his shelter, so as to be protected from the weather, and made a fire." As he cooked his meal in the gathering twilight, he was astounded to see that "the three roads became all the brighter the darker it grew, a thing that surprised him to the point of fear." But as he reflected on that strange apparition, he came to realize that one of those roads must lead to the Master of Life, the object of his quest. The next morning he set out upon the broadest of the roads. Pausing to catch his breath after half a day of walking, Neolin "suddenly saw a great fire coming out of the earth." As he approached, the flames soared higher. Terrified, he retraced his route and, back at the prairie, "took another road which was narrower than the first one." But after a few hours' travel he once again encountered an inferno and, trembling, made his way back to the beginning. Setting out on the third and narrowest trail, he journeyed</page><page sequence="8">Z7Z Alfred A. Cave for a day without encountering anything of note. But "suddenly he saw before him what appeared to be a mountain of marvelous whiteness, and he stopped, overcome with astonishment." Approaching the mountain, Neolin "could no longer see any road and was sad." Looking around, he finally beheld a woman "of radiant beauty, whose garments dimmed the whiteness of the snow. She was seated." As he gazed upon that apparition, she spoke to him in his own dialect, and explained that to approach the Master of Life he must first disrobe, leave all his possessions behind, and go bathe in a nearby river. Neolin followed her instructions and, naked, then tried to climb the mountain. But it was "perpendicular, pathless, and smooth as ice." Unable to make any head- way, he appealed to the woman in white. She told him that he must use only "his left hand and his left foot" in the ascent. The climb was difficult, but Neolin somehow made it to the top "by dint of effort." At the sum- mit, the woman disappeared. He was now without a guide. He saw to his right three villages. "He did not know them for they seemed of different construction from is own, prettier and more orderly in appearance." After some reflection, Neolin walked toward the most attractive vil- lage but halfway there remembered that he was naked and stopped, con- fused and uncertain as to what to do next. Then "he heard a voice telling him to continue and that he ought not to fear, because, having bathed as he had, he could go on in assurance." At the gate to the village, he was greeted by "a handsome man, all dressed in white," who promised to take him to the Master of Life. Coming to "a place of surpassing beauty," Neo- lin encountered a figure "who took him by the hand and gave him a hat all bordered with gold to sit down upon." He was reluctant, "for fear of spoiling the hat, but he was ordered to do so, and obeyed without reply." Neolin was now in the presence of the Master of Life, who declared: "I am He who hath created the heavens and the earth, the trees, lakes, rivers, all men, and all thou seest and hath seen upon the earth. Because I love you, ye must do what I say and love, and not do what I hate." He learned that the creator was displeased with his Indian children, and that the sufferings which had plagued them were the results of their transgres- sions. The Master of Life denounced their addiction to the white man's alcohol, and deplored Indian polygamy, sexual promiscuity, witchcraft, and strife. But their gravest offense was toleration of European intruders. "This land where ye dwell I have made for you and not for others," Neolin was told. "Whence comes it that ye permit the Whites upon your lands? Can ye not live without them? I know that those whom ye call the children of the Great Father supply your needs, but if ye were not evil as ye are, ye could surely do without them. Ye could live as ye did live before knowing</page><page sequence="9">The Delaware Prophet Neolin z73 them,-before those whom ye call your brothers had come upon the land. Did ye not live by bows and arrows? Ye had no need of gun or powder, or anything else, and nevertheless ye caught animals to live upon and to dress yourselves with their skins. But when I saw that ye were given up to evil, I led the wild animals to the depths of the forests so that ye had to depend upon your brothers [the whites] to feed and shelter you. Ye have only to become good again and do what I wish, and I will send back the animals for your food." The Master of Life then declared that to regain his favor and restore the game animals that once sustained his people, the Indians must re- sist further European incursions. "As to those who come to trouble your lands,-drive them out, make war upon them. I do not love them at all; they know me not, and are my enemies.... Send them back to the lands which I have created and let them stay there." Indians must also pray only to the Master of Life, using a set prayer he had given Neolin, and abandon their practice of calling upon other deities and spirit protectors, "because in 'making medicine' one talks with the evil spirit." Finally, the creator called for Indian unity and assured his children that "when ye shall have need of anything, address yourselves to me; and as to your brothers, I shall give it to you as to them; do not sell to your brothers what I have put on earth for food. In short, be good and ye shall receive your needs. When ye meet one another exchange greetings and proffer the left hand which is nearest the heart." On his return from his journey to heaven, Neolin announced that God had promised that, if his commandments were kept, he would restore the good life his people had enjoyed before the European invasion of the continent.21 Other sources confirm the accuracy of Pontiac's account of Neolin's message. The Moravian missionary John Heckewelder learned from Indian informants that the prophet claimed that the Master of Life had demanded that they "put off entirely . . . the customs which you have adopted since the white people came among us; you are to return to that former happy state, in which we loved in peace and plenty, before these strangers came to disturb us." They were not to tolerate white incursions on the lands God had given them. Above all, however, Indians must now engage in the pure worship of the creator and pray only to the Master of Life, using a set prayer he had given Neolin. They must repudiate their shamans and the forces those shamans invoked. If those instructions were obeyed, Neolin promised that "the great Spirit [will] give success to our arms. . . . He will give us strength to conquer our enemies."22 Similar accounts are to be found in the journal of the Quaker trader James Kenny and in the captivity narrative of John M'Culloch.23</page><page sequence="10">274 Alfred A. Cave Neolin's description of his journey to heaven drew upon powerful and ubiquitous themes in traditional Native American spiritual lore. The prophet's quest was undertaken in response to a dream. As one recent authority notes, "the most vital and intimate phase of Delaware religion was a belief in dreams and visions, and in the existence of personal guard- ian spirits. The vision was the point of contact, a line of communication between the supernatural world and the sphere of everyday life."24 Equally familiar was the idea of a sky journey culminating in a religious revela- tion. Dowd has noted that "throughout the Eastern Woodlands, Native Americans commonly believed that their rituals and ceremonies had once been gifts, donated by benevolent forces. According to some myths, culture heroes had received these ceremonies after crossing into other dimensions of the universe. Such crossings were always dangerous and themselves required ritual.... Successful passage to and from the upper world ... re- quired supernatural aid and ceremony. Such travel entailed risks but could bring great rewards."25 Neolin's description of an encounter, on the road to heaven, with a flaming inferno drew upon that traditional belief in the exceptional difficulty and danger of such travel. The figure of the woman in white who taught Neolin the means of ascending the crystal mountain of heaven and the man in white who led him into the presence of God were immediately recognizable, for it was understood that sky journeys were not possible without a spirit guide. The strange method employed to climb the mountain suggests use of a ritual to gain access to the higher realm. Finally, Neolin's revelation of commandments that, if observed, would bring about the restoration of game and the defeat of the invader, was comprehensible within a tradition that held that the acquisition of power was the prime purpose of a spiritual quest. But it does not follow that we can explain Neolin's prophecy as an outgrowth of indigenous beliefs. Although his trip to heaven in the par- ticulars outlined above resembled a shamanic sky journey, other aspects of his message are clearly alien to Delaware tradition. Despite their opposi- tion to cultural accommodation with Europeans, Neolin and other nativist preachers of revitalization were not calling for a strict return to tradi- tional spiritual practices. Their invocation of an omnipotent, omnipresent Jehovah-like supreme deity, who had presumably punished his Indian chil- dren for their adherence to certain well-established traditional practices, such as polygamy and the "medicine dance," represented a radical new development in Native American religious thought. In order to understand this revitalization movement, we must digress and reflect upon traditional Native American concepts of the holy, for only then can we place Neolin and his contemporaries in their proper context.</page><page sequence="11">The Delaware Prophet Neolin z75 Belief in an all-powerful creator god, omnipotent, omnipresent, and in firm control of historical processes, was not a characteristic of pre- contact Native American religions. As numerous authorities have noted, prior to the European invasion, Indians in North America had no concept of an anthropomorphic male creator god as "a ruling deity" personally governing the universe and intervening in the daily lives of human beings. While they had various conceptions of a creator, ranging all the way from a highly abstract Great Holy Flame of Life to a Great Condor, Indians usually regarded that deity as a distant and austere figure, neither omni- present nor omnipotent in human affairs. Their conceptions of the supreme being were far more complex and sophisticated than early European ob- servers realized. As one authority notes, those ideas of the deity included the Pawnee Tirawa, "a mighty power in human form," who could be "seen or heard or felt" by human beings only "through sixteen lesser powers, especially Wind, Cloud, Lightning, and Thunder," as well as the Sioux Wakan Tanka, also knowable only through sixteen manifestations. "In his person as Wakinyan Tanka, the Thunder Being and giver of revelation," the Sioux supreme being "is shapeless but winged, headless but beaked; all of his young come from a single egg, and when he devours them they become his many selves." Among the Beaver of the Pacific Northwest we encounter Yagasati, "who is both male and female, motionless but the creator of all motion." The Zuni deity Poshayaank'i lives in mist, has an almost human shape, but "looks like fire." The Winnebago Ma'ura made man in his image, "but appears only as a voice and a ray of light."26 These diverse supreme beings and/or creator gods (the creator was not always the supreme being) were seldom objects of direct human suppli- cation, nor were they represented as jealous gods who punished those humans who had recourse to other spirits. Instead, sacred power was most often sought through the intercession of lesser spirit beings, and was be- lieved to be immanent in many objects both animate and inanimate in the physical world.27 Like other Eastern Woodland Indians, Neolin's people, the Lenape were a deeply religious folk who regularly sought guidance and assistance from the spirit world. But, as noted above, the spiritual power that was so important both to the individual's well-being, and to the community, did not usually come directly from a supreme being. Their conceptions of the creator's nature and role were varied. Lenape stories of the creation, as recorded by European traders and missionaries in the early contact period, were not consistent. Some spoke of the present world as the handiwork of a tortoise who carried the island humans would later occupy on his back and lifted land out of the primal waters that covered the universe. In that</page><page sequence="12">Z76 Alfred A. Cave version, the first men and women sprouted from the root of a tree that grew in the middle of earth.28 Other early Delaware informants related that the world was created by a pregnant woman who fell from the sky at the dawn of time.29 In eighteenth-century sources we encounter Kishelemu- kong, a male sky god "who creates us by his thoughts."30 It is likely that earlier European commentators mistook stories about the creation event for accounts of the ultimate creator himself. It is not to be assumed that Kishelemukong was a postcontact innovation. This creator deity was not, however, the omnipresent, omnipotent, and judgmental god Neolin would later call "the Master of Life." The Delaware creator contemplated his creation, but he did not rule it directly.31 A Delaware informant told C. C. Trowbridge in I823 that while the creator remained on earth for a short time after the creation, and exercised "moral superintendency of all affairs therein," he soon departed and never returned.32 The Moravian missionary Heckewelder related that the Delaware believed that they must look to "the subordinate spirits . . . between God and man" for help and protection, for the creator had turned the world over to those spirits.33 Direct access to the creator was achieved only during the Big House (Gamwing) ceremony. As Miller notes, in this ceremony, celebrated in "a special building sym- bolic of the universe," the Delaware renewed "their spiritual ties with all creation." In that renewal, "the entire congregation symbolically rose each night through one of the twelve layers between earth and heaven, finally reaching the abode of the Creator ('the one who thought us into being') on the last night."34 But in their everyday life, the Delaware addressed their supplications to the "agents to whom he [the creator] has given charge of the elements, and with whom the people feel they have a close personal relation, as their actions are seen in every sunrise and thunderstorm, and felt in every wind that blows across woodland and prairie."35 Individual access to the sacred was fundamental to traditional Dela- ware religious practice. Through vision quests in adolescence, Delaware males commonly obtained protection and gained power from various spirit beings. An early European observer of the Lenape, writing in i656, re- ported that their young men generally made contact with an "idol" at age fifteen.36 In the following century the Moravian missionary David Zeis- berger reported that young Delaware males undertook their vision quests between the ages of twelve and fourteen.37 Contact with the supernatural through the vision quest was essential to the Delaware, as it brought suc- cess to the hunter and prowess to the warrior.38 For that reason, parents sometimes drove their teenaged sons from their homes and forced them to take refuge in wilderness areas believed to be frequented by spirits. Those few Delaware males whose vision quests failed to obtain the guidance of</page><page sequence="13">The Delaware Prophet Neolin 277 a spirit were regarded as marginal people, devoid of power, deficient in manhood.39 Zeisberger found that the Delaware claimed to receive spirit power from a great variety of entities, ranging from celestial objects to insects. He was surprised to learn that some Lenapes received visions from such "ridiculously insignificant creatures as ants." Although the form they assumed might on occasion strike Europeans as bizarre, the role these entities played in Delaware life cannot be overstated.40 Those whose vision quests were successful fabricated small representations of their guardians, which they wore on a chain around the neck.41 They believed, as Zeis- berger related, that they were now able, through spirit power, to "perform extraordinary exploits."42 Shamans enjoyed an access to the spirit world of an exceptional order that emanated from "the extraordinary potency" of their particular visions. Through those visions, they were able to personally manifest "the holiness of the other world," expressed through remarkable physical transforma- tions in which they sometimes turned into animals and at other times left their bodies altogether to embark on sky journeys to the spirit realm.43 Rituals conducted by shamans played a vital role in the life of the commu- nity, for through them the people collectively received "vital energy" from the spirit world. "The dramatic actions, the emotional chants, the terrify- ing masks, and the elaborate dances all bring about contact with a spiritual energy that sustains society." 44 Shamanic power was utilized in other ways as well. Among the Delaware, some shamans specialized in divination and in rain making. Others made love potions, or prepared "medicine" to assist hunters in locating and killing game. Many were devoted to the curing of illness, perhaps the shamans' most important function. Delaware women as well as men served as shamans. They tended to be elderly, and were well paid for their services in wampum, peltry, tobacco, and other valued substances. Despite the crucial role of the shamans, they possessed no monopoly on supernatural power, which in the Lenape world was open to all through dreams and visions. As one authority notes, "An individual who received his guardian spirit in a vision could appeal to this spirit as his own special protector for aid and comfort in times of trouble, and sometimes to fore- tell coming events. The guardian spirit, usually an animal or bird, took a personal interest in his affairs, whereas the creator and the subordinate Manetuwak were so busy controlling other natural forces that they might not be able to concern themselves with the affairs of one individual."45 The Manetuwak were four spirits, located at each of the cardinal di- rections, to whom the creator had assigned responsibility for the world's natural forces. The Delaware addressed these Manetuwak as grandpar-</page><page sequence="14">Z78 Alfred A. Cave ents. Three grandfathers presided over the north, the west, and the east. Koo-hum-mun-nah, "Our Grandmother," was the guardian of the south. These powerful deities, aided by the sun and the moon, whom the Dela- ware venerated as Elder Brothers, controlled the weather, and were objects of human supplication. In the great semiannual communal rituals of the Delaware, the Green Corn Ceremony and the Big House Ceremony, the creator and the four great Manetuwak played a prominent part. They were invoked in the chants that accompanied the intense drumming and dancing, and were also mentioned in individual prayers during commu- nal ceremonies. But in their descriptions of the spirits that influenced their lives, the Delaware spoke often of lesser spirits. Among them were Thunderbeings, described as "huge birds with human heads whose duty it was to water the earth." They were manifested in thunder and lightning, and were said to protect the world from the Great Horned Serpent, an evil reptile who once lived in the sea. Spirit protectors had killed the Great Horned Serpent, but the pieces of its flesh that were preserved in medi- cine bundles were said to possess great power. Also of great importance were the Masked Being, sometimes described as the Keeper of Animals, a spirit being who controlled the activities of game; the Earth Mother, "whose duty it is to carry and nourish the people and the animals"; and "Mother Corn, who has dominion over all vegetation and is envisioned as an elderly woman who resides in the far heavens." Communal well-being depended on the favor of those spirits, and also on neutralizing the power of various malevolent beings. Delaware songs, dances, and sacrifices of "burnt meat, tobacco, cedar and other substances," were all intended to gain the assistance of nature spirits. In these observances those spirits, not the creator directly, offered protection to those who successfully invoked their power.46 The public recitation of visions obtained from such guardian spirits was a highlight of major Delaware religious ceremonials.4 The cataloging of religious ideas, practices, and rituals commonly found in most scholarly accounts of the Delaware does not capture the underlying unifying principles that infused their spiritual life with coher- ence and meaning. Jay Miller, however, has endeavored to probe "the internal logical consistency that serves to integrate, maintain, and reinter- pret" Delaware culture. He finds that "Delaware culture derives from the basic equation of Woman and Man, mediated by Mind.... In terms of expression, Woman is constrained, specific, limited, segregating, masked, and exclusive; Man is unconstrained, generic, unlimited, integrating, un- marked, and inclusive. Mind is open, permeating, limitless, congregating, and inclusive." Delaware ritual, in Miller's analysis, was grounded in the culture's interplay of gender and mind, "expressing community identity and cosmic harmony," and affirming both "responsibility and revelation."48</page><page sequence="15">The Delaware Prophet Neolin 279 Assuming that Miller's analysis is valid, how does Neolin relate to that traditional Delaware cosmology? While there is some evidence that the prophet encouraged the Big House rite as "a means of proclaiming Delaware identity,"49 his own teachings about the nature of the supreme deity as a jealous, male sky god is not consistent with the subtle, intricately balanced interplay between a creator who "functions through thought" and the gendered spirit beings who are his agents that lies at the heart of traditional Delaware belief. Reliance on the help of lesser spirits, as we have noted, was an essential element of Delaware spirituality, observed even in the one rite (the Big House) wherein the people approached the creator directly. How are we to interpret Neolin's insistence that the cre- ator abominated the practice of calling upon lesser deities? You will recall that in Neolin's sky journey revelation, the Master of Life warned that when "ye conjure and resort to the medicine dance, believing that ye speak to me; ye are mistaken, -it is to the Manitou that ye speak, an evil spirit who prompts you to nothing but wrong, and who listens to you out of ignorance of me." At one level, Neolin's condemnation of certain sha- manic practices made eminent good sense to traditionalists who believed that shamanic power, being morally neutral, and subject to manipulation, could be used malevolently. Neolin lived in a time of heightened witchcraft anxiety within Native American communities. Those anxieties were the product of the deprivation and demoralization that followed in the wake of epidemics, military defeats, loss of land, and forced migrations.50 But Neolin departs from the traditional understanding of witchcraft. He does not denounce medicine men for their abuse of their power; he charges that they are in collusion with the "Evil One." We have here a vision of a dualistic spirit world with the Master of Life in opposition to a hated "evil spirit." Who was Neolin's "Evil One"? The prophet may have been influenced to some degree by traditional Lenape stories about the Mahtanu, a trick- ster figure who spoiled the creator's perfect work by such malicious acts as adding thorns to berry bushes and creating stinging insects and poisonous reptiles. But the Mahtanu did not play the commanding role that Neolin assigned to the Evil One, who on closer analysis resembles the Christian Devil. The Moravian missionary George Loskiel noted that the Lenape had "no idea of the Devil, as the Prince of Darkness, before Europeans came into the county." In his warnings against the "Medicine Dance," Neolin in effect portrayed a form of Devil worship. That idea is one that he probably picked up from contact with Christian missionaries.5' His "Evil One" has no real counterpart in the traditional Lenape pantheon. Neolin also spoke of hell. While an earlier Delaware religious teacher had assured the Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd that belief in a</page><page sequence="16">z80 Alfred A. Cave place of eternal torment in the afterlife was a Christian superstition that had no counterpart in Native American lore, Neolin threatened those who failed to heed his message with hellfire.52 The prophet and his followers, M'Culloch reported, relied upon a diagram of the afterlife that portrayed a heaven and hell corresponding not to Native American conceptions but to Christian teachings. In his drawing, Neolin included one area where the fortunate "went immediately after death to heaven" and another, popu- lated by the "abandonedly wicked" who were dispatched "immediately on the road that leads to hell." There were other areas, reminiscent of the Catholic Purgatory, "where the wicked have to undergo a certain degree of punishment, before they are admitted into heaven." Between heaven and that place of temporary affliction lie "a pure spring of water, where those who have been punished . .. stop to quench their thirsts, after they have undergone purgation by fire." John Heckewelder, who also had seen a copy of Neolin's map of heaven and hell, learned that when explaining the meaning of the design, the prophet claimed that Indians could no longer enter paradise through the usual, broad avenue, as it was "now in the possession of the white people." Instead, they were forced to traverse a narrow and treacherous pathway, which was "both difficult and dangerous for them to enter, there being many impediments in their way, besides a large ditch leading to a gulf below, over which they had to leap." The evil spirit laid in wait at the ditch, seized Indians who faltered, and carried them away to a parched and hungry wasteland where he sometimes "transformed men into horses to be ridden at his pleasure." As Heckewelder recounted Neolin's message, the prophet charged that Indian appeasement of whites had resulted not only in misery in this life but in torment in the life to come. Pointing to the lost avenue to paradise, Neolin would exclaim: Look here! See what we have lost by neglect and disobedience; by being remiss in the expression of our gratitude to the great Spirit, for what he has bestowed on us; by neglecting to make to him suf- ficient sacrifices; by looking upon a people of a different color from our own, who had come across a great lake, as if they were part of ourselves, by suffering to sit down by our side, and looking at them with indifference, when they were not only taking our country from us, but this (pointing to the spot), this, our own avenue, leading into those beautiful regions which were destined for us. Such is the sad condition to which we are reduced.53 The argument, advanced by some scholars, that Neolin replaced taboo with a new sense of sin borrowed from Euro-American Christians, while</page><page sequence="17">The Delaware Prophet Neolin z8I not invalid, to some extent oversimplifies and overstates the case.54 While many of the commandments of Neolin's Master of Life are reminiscent of those of the Judeo-Christian God, and no doubt reflect missionary influ- ence, the new ritual observances Neolin sought to establish do not quite fit the pattern of a religion grounded in concepts of guilt, repentance, and atonement. While he denounced certain traditional shamanic ritu- als, the prophet instituted numerous new ritual practices that reflected a Native American, not a Euro-American understanding of the relationship of human beings and spiritual forces. He required his followers to buy, and use twice a day, a prayer stick on which had been carved the prayer given him by the Master of Life. He also required that they purchase from him a parchment which he called "the Great Book or Writing." But this was not a scripture. It was rather a map that charted the route to heaven. Neolin initiated a ritual handshake and rites of purification involving both sexual abstinence and use of an emetic probably derived from the Black Drink of the southeast. Finally, he placed a prohibition on the use of flint and steel in making fires, and of firearms in hunting game, and called for the elimination of foodstuffs of European origin from the Native American diet. Observance of these rituals and prohibitions, Neolin declared, would give to his followers that infusion of sacred power essential to ridding the land of the corrupting presence of the white man.55 The concept of ritual observance as the gateway to the attainment of supernatural power was not borrowed from Christians; it was fundamental to Native American spirituality. Here again we find in Neolin's teachings an interweaving of traditional and syncretic elements. It is not sufficient, however, to note that the Delaware Prophet invoked both traditional and borrowed ideas about God, the Devil, and witches in his call for a reformation in Native American religious practices. Neolin's message must be placed within its historical context. It came at a time when the Lenape and other dispossessed and threatened peoples were not only angry about past losses, but desperately worried about the future. Neolin provided an ideological basis for resistance and hope by proclaim- ing that unity against the intruders would be rewarded by the favor and protection of the creator. His revelation that the Delaware were enduring privations because of their transgressions drew in part on the common- place Native American assumption that grave misfortunes would befall those who offended the spirits. An example is the belief, noted earlier, that offenses against the Master of Animals would be punished by the disap- pearance of game. But Neolin added a new element into the customary explanations of worldly misfortune by his emphasis on moral, as opposed to ritual, offenses, by his identification of the source of wrath as the creator</page><page sequence="18">z8z Alfred A. Cave himself, and by his extension of punishment into the world to come. Those aspects of his doctrine appear on the surface to be purely Christian in origin and therefore alien. But in fact they were well suited to the changed circumstances of Delaware life. Emphasis on divine providence and on salvation, both communal and individual, served immediate and pressing needs. By replacing, or at least supplementing, the traditional vision quests, healing ceremonies, and communal rituals of renewal with a religion of moral commandments reinforced by the promise of heaven for the righteous and hellfire for the disobedient, the prophet armed his followers with a powerful means of shoring up the discipline their beleaguered and divided communities needed if they were to resist further white incursions. The idea of a his- toric divine providence, inexorable and just, reinforced that discipline and added a badly needed measure of hope for this world. Even the new em- phasis on moral guilt, seemingly alien to a people accustomed to relating to spirit beings in terms of ritual and taboo, was empowering, for, as Richard White notes, "the great advantage of accepting guilt is that it restores power to the guilty party. To take the blame is, in a sense, to take control.56 The nativist doctrines which condemned Indians for their compromises with whites and threatened utter catastrophe if emulation of European ways did not cease complemented borrowed concepts about God and divine providence nicely, as together they affirmed that through reformation the future would indeed belong to the Great Spirit's chosen people. Neolin's denunciations of both those who engaged in the "Medi- cine Dance" and those who compromised with Europeans reflected and served the political needs, for traditionalist village leaders were an impedi- ment to tribal and pan-Indian unification, and accomodationist leaders had accepted dispossession and exile. Receptivity to Neolin's teachings was an outgrowth of disaffection with leaders who had either failed to protect or who had sold out. The prophet's teachings spread throughout the Delaware bands. On March I, I763 the trader James Kenny noted in his journal that he had learned from a Delaware informant that their "Whole Nation" had agreed to fol- low Neolin. They were training boys "to the use of the bow and arrow," and hoped, after a seven-year transitional period, to "Clothe themselves with Skins." and eat only traditional foods obtained in the old way. They would then "quit all commerce with the White People." The movement, Kenny reported, was restricted to the Delaware, as "none of the other Nations" had accepted "the Scheme."5 ' Kenny was mistaken in his assumption that the prophetic movement</page><page sequence="19">The Delaware Prophet Neolin 283 was limited to the Delaware. Neolin's preaching helped provide the spiri- tual foundation not only of Delaware unity but also of a nascent pan- Indian resistance movement. Within the year, the message had reached demoralized and disaffected tribes as far west as the Illinois country. It played a major role in the resistance movement mounted by Pontiac and other war leaders who sought to mobilize a pan-Indian uprising against British occupation of the trans-Allegheny regions. The Delaware prophets' call for Native American unity, their assertion of a divinely sanctioned Indian racial identity, as Dowd reminds us, represented a dramatic de- parture from "the heritage of Indian diversity and of highly localized, familial, and ethnically oriented government.... In reaching beyond both the boundaries of clan or village and the less easily defined boundaries of people, chiefdom, nation or confederacy to include all Native Americans, the seekers of Indian unity threatened to subvert both the authority of clan or village leaders and the concentrating authority of those whom the Anglo-Americans called 'tribal' chiefs."58 The popular appeal of Neolin's message of hope and of resistance in Native American communities in- habited by dispossessed refugees and by indigenous peoples fearful of loss of power and autonomy is understandable. Old leadership sustained by the old religion of the medicine man-shaman had failed to protect against disease, hunger, and defeat. To many Native Americans who pondered the meaning of recent events, the old way now seemed to be devoid of power. The new religion of Christ, which had seemingly empowered the white man, seemed to many Indians a strange and alien faith, identified with the invader and not suited to the Indian way. But the message of the prophets brought word from a powerful deity, the creator himself, who promised salvation to the Indian both in this world and the next. The revitalization gospel offered both an explanation of suffering and defeat, and a promise of victory and restoration. It brought hope to those who had despaired. Recent reassessments of Pontiac have suggested that while earlier historians often exaggerated his personal role in the uprisings of I763- 64, the overall accomplishments of the Native American resistance with which he was associated generally have been underestimated. Although Pontiac's warriors were not successful in expelling the British from Detroit or Pittsburgh, neither were they decisively defeated by their European ad- versaries, as earlier insurgents had been. As one recent scholar notes, "an unprecedented balance of power had been achieved, the war had become a stalemate; and the peace was an accommodation."59 The movement's success was made possible by intertribal cooperation. While Pontiac and others failed to unite all of the tribes, the coalitions they did forge were fairly formidable. Our information on the means used to achieve that mea-</page><page sequence="20">Z84 Alfred A. Cave sure of unity is scanty, but the reports we do have reveal that Pontiac, in his pan-Indian appeal, referred constantly to the revelations of Neolin and invoked the power and authority of Neolin's new God. The religion of the Delaware prophet, as we have seen, was grounded in a new belief that all Indians were God's chosen people, that whites were children of an evil spirit, and that the road to salvation lay in Indian unity and in the recla- mation of Indian ways. It was, quite simply, the religion of an incipient pan-Indian movement that, had objective circumstances been more favor- able, might well have paved the way to the emergence of Native American nationalism and a Native American state. Pontiac, of course, adapted Neo- lin's teachings to his own needs. He exempted the French, whose military assistance he hoped to receive, from condemnation as enemies of the Mas- ter of Life. His version of the prophet's teachings placed somewhat more emphasis on armed resistance, and less on cultural renewal, than we find in other accounts. But it cannot be said that he misrepresented Neolin's basic message. The important point is that Neolin's proclamation that the creator himself favored Indians and regarded whites as intruders provided powerful spiritual support for the leaders of armed resistance. It is no coincidence that when Tecumseh, half a century after the death of Pon- tiac, revived the call for a pan-Indian uprising he claimed the sanction of a body of religious teachings promulgated by his brother, Tenskwatawa, the Shawnee prophet, that were in most particulars virtually identical to the revelations of Neolin. In I764 the vision of an Indian nation sustained by the favor of the Great Spirit could not be realized, for the centrifugal tendencies of Native American societies prevailed over the call to unity and resistance. But the armed uprisings the prophets did help inspire and rationalize remind us anew of both the crucial role of ideology in shaping human responses to historic change and of the ingenuity of indigenous peoples in appropriating alien ideas to serve as weapons in their struggles to reassert their cultural integrity. The most significant contribution of Neolin and other eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century revitalization prophets to Native American life is to be found in their appropriation of Judeo-Christian ideas about a creator god in control of historical processes and their recasting of that deity as the Great Spirit. They did not simply borrow those ideas wholesale, but rather reinterpreted teachings of Christian missionaries by drawing upon funda- mental and underlying Native American concepts about their relationships to the created world and the spiritual forces that animate it. Hence, the high God they envisioned was not the Christian God who required that all peoples submit to the religion of Christ and embrace European values and</page><page sequence="21">The Delaware Prophet Neolin 285 customs. He was instead a deity who smiled upon the Indian way, who was angered by their compromises with the intruders, and who promised that repudiation of Europeans and all their works would lead to the res- toration of the good world that Indians enjoyed before their corruption. Revelations about the creator's plan for mankind constituted the most sig- nificant and radical aspect of the prophetic message, for the dreams and visions which were customary in spiritual Lenape life were not ordinarily cast in such a grandiose communal/historical mode. The Great Spirit, like the Judeo-Christian God, had a grand historical design, one ideally suited to emergent insurgent movements. The new doctrine of the Great Spirit as ruler and judge of mankind offered powerful ideological support to advocates of armed resistance such as Neolin and the later Shawnee prophet Tenskwatawa. But belief in obe- dience to the will of the creator was also a vital part of the message of later revitalization prophets, such as Handsome Lake and the Kickapoo prophet Kenekuk, who rejected violence and preached coexistence. As they called upon their people to embrace those cultural changes deemed vital to their survival and, at the same time, reminded whites of their obligations to re- spect treaty obligations and Native rights, these visionaries often warned, in the words of Kenekuk, that "everything belongs to the Great Spirit. If he chooses to make the earth shake, or turn it over, . .. [no one] can stop it." 60 That sense of historical providence linked to a concept of supernatural intervention to assure the ultimate triumph of divine justice, so fundamen- tal to later Native American religious movements such as the Ghost Dance, had its roots in the teachings of Neolin and his contemporaries. While their appropriation of certain Judeo-Christian ideas is undeniable, undue em- phasis upon the nonindigenous aspects of their prophecies obscures both the creativity and the significance of their work. Notes i Anthony F. C. Wallace provides the standard definition of revitalization as "a deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture." In his analysis, nativism, the restoration of control to a culturally displaced people, is one of several forms which revitalization may assume. "Nativistic Movements ... are revitalization movements characterized by strong emphasis on the elinination of alien persons, customs, values, and/or material from the mazeway."

By contrast, Gregory Evans Dowd (A Spirited Resistance: The North Aman Indian Struggle for Unity, 1745-i8i5 [Baltimore, MD, I992], 23-36) stresses the prophets' roots in traditional Algonquian spirituality.

Some eighteenth-century observers claimed that the Delaware had long been orga- nized into three large tribal entities, the Unalachtigo (Turkey), a coastal nation, the Unami (Turtle) in the adjacent interior, and the Munsi (Wolf) in the high- lands, and a number of historians have followed their lead. But, as Robert Steven Grumet indicates, "the evidence suggests that those entities did not exist in the seventeenth century," but originated in exile communities in Pennsylvania and Ohio in the eighteenth century.

David Brainerd conjectured that the practice she challenged was a form of witchcraft. But the prophetess's message may have been far broader than Brainerd realized. Dowd suggests that she was in the vanguard of a move- ment to oust local leaders who collaborated with the British, a movement that culminated in Delaware support of the French in the Seven Years War.

For political reasons, Pontiac represented the Master of Life as hostile to the British but friendly to the French. Neolin made no such distinction. His message is clearly anti-white, not just anti-British. Some scholars also feel Pontiac may have misrepresented Neolin in calling for an armed uprising. But given the uncompromising nativist tone of his teachings, it is unlikely that the prophet would have been both- ered by Pontiac's invocation of the Master of Life in his call to arms. The question of whether Neolin himself ever explicitly advocated armed resistance cannot be resolved, given the ambiguity of the sources, but the report of John M'Culloch ("Narrative of the Captivity") strongly suggests that the promise of an expulsion of Europeans was at the heart of his message. 2z Heckewelder, History, Manners, and Customs, 29I-93. 23 M'Culloch, "Narrative of the Captivity," 273-76.

The literature on shamanism is extensive. Mircea Eliade's magisterial Shaman- ism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (Princeton, NJ, I964) provides an invaluable worldwide comparative perspective. For a succinct summary of information on Delaware shamanism, see Newcomb, "Culture and Acculturation of the Dela- ware," 69-70. Also of use are D. G. Brinton, The Lenape and Their Legends (Philadelphia, i885); Richard C. Adams, The Ancient Religion of the Delaware (Washington, DC, I903); and M. H.

It should also be noted that a teaching attributed to Neolin in one report from a Euro-American trader, unconfirmed indeed contradicted in other sources, has erroneously been interpreted as an example of Christian influence. According to James Kenny, cited above, Neolin told his followers that they could not address the creator directly, but must pray instead to "the little god." Some scholars have identified 'the little god" with Jesus Christ. But there is nothing in Kenny's report to suggest that Neolin was speaking of a Messiah, savior or human son of the creator, or of a being that suffered to atone for human sins. If Kenny's report is accurate, it is likely that we have here not a reference to Jesus but rather an allusion to the long-standing Delaware belief that the creator could be addressed only through intermediaries. This report may reflect either an early stage in Neolin's thought or offer evidence of later modification of his teachings to accommodate traditionalist ideas about the Lenape's relationship to the creator. 56 White, The Middle Ground, 283. 57 Kenny, "Journal," i88. 58 Dowd, Spirited Resistance, z. 59 Ian K.
