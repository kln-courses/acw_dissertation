Public School Code of 1949, ? 1516, as amended, PA. STAT. ANN. tit. 24, ? 15-1516 (1950). This section provides: At least ten verses from the Holy Bible shall be read, or caused to be read, without comment, at the opening of each public school on each school day, by the teacher in charge ....</page><page sequence="2">1959] Recent Decisions 1377 ten verses of either the King James or Douay Bible or the Jewish Holy Scriptures were read daily to students in schools attended by plaintiffs' three children. Teachers were responsible, upon pain of dismissal, for the reading, which was done without comment, the reader selecting whichever version of the Bible he preferred and the passage to be read therefrom. One of plaintiffs' children was required to remain in attendance during these read- ings despite his objections. Plaintiffs who with their children were of the Unitarian faith,2 sought both a declaration that the practice required by the statute constituted an establishment of religion and an interference with the free exercise thereof, and a permanent injunction against the prac- tice. Defendants, the school district and school officials, contended that freedom of religion or of conscience does not include the right to prevent others from hearing the Bible read in the public schools, that the exercises were a substantial aid in developing the minds and morals of school chil- dren, that the state has the constitutional right to employ such practices in its educational program, and that there was no compulsion upon the plain- tiffs or their children in respect to religious observances. In a trial before a three judge district court, held, for the plaintiffs. A state statute requiring that the Holy Bible be read daily, without comment, to students in the public schools provides for an establishment and interference with the free exercise of religion, violating the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States as applied to the states by the fourteenth amendment.8 Schempp v. School Dist., Civil No. 24119, E.D. Pa., Sept. 16, 1959. The United States is a religious nation whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.4 Nevertheless, in recognition of the danger inherent in the If any school teacher, whose duty it shall be to read the Holy Bible, or cause it to be read, shall fail or omit so to do, said school teacher shall be discharged. 2. The children and their father testified that certain items of religious doctrine pur- veyed by a literal reading of the Bible, particularly the King James version, were contrary to their religious beliefs and to their familial teaching. The eldest child testified that he did not believe in the divinity of Christ, the Immaculate Conception, or the concepts of an anthropomorphic God or the Trinity, and that all of these doc- trines were read to him during the course of his instruction at his school. 3. The court also held the combined practice of Bible reading and mass recitation of the Lord's Prayer to be unconstitutional. The inclusion of the Lord's Prayer in the exercises was not prescribed by statute but had long been customary. 4. Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313 (1952) (dictum); cf.

The Court has listed numerous instances of the interrelation between religion and the government, e.g., churches pay taxes and receive fire and police protection; state functions and judicial proceedings, including those of the Supreme Court, often com- mence with a prayer or an appeal to God.

The state may restrict religious freedom only to prevent grave and immediate danger to interests which the state may lawfully protect.8 (1952); Everson v.

The clauses of the first amendment pertaining to religion have been applied to the states by the fourteenth amendment. Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296 (1940). Justice Rutledge has executed a detailed history of the clauses of the first amendment pertaining to religion. Everson v. Board of Educ., supra at 28 (dissenting opinion with which Frankfurter, Jackson, and Burton, JJ., concur). See also Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 162-64 (1878). The import of Justice Rutledge's analysis is that the establishment prohibition was construed so as to forbid not only preferential treat- ment of one sect but also forbidding "every form of public aid or support for religion," meaning religion in general. Everson v. Board of Educ., supra at 31-32 (dissenting opin- ion). Contra, e.g., Corwin, The Supreme Court as National School Board, 14 LAW &amp; CONTEMP. PROB. 3, 16-20 (1949). However, Justice Reed indicates that Jefferson, the originator of the "wall of separa- tion" concept, felt that instruction in religious opinion and duties was an essential part of education and that it was not intended to preclude such instruction when the first amendment was passed. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333 U.S. 203, 245-48 (1948) (dissenting opinion). Also, the Northwest Ordinance, first enacted in 1787, proclaimed: "religion, morality, and knowledge, being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged." Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 51, n.(a), art. III. While maintaining that our public school is organized on the premise that secular education can be isolated from all religious teaching, see Everson v. Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 23-24 (1947) (dissenting opinion), Justice Jackson warns of the danger in attempting to eliminate from public education everything which is objectionable to any religious sect which chooses to bring its complaints into court. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333 U.S. 203, 235-38 (1948) (concurring opinion). Remarking the undesirability of attempting to teach music without the sacred themes or architecture without the cathedral or even biology without raising the issue of man's origin, he concludes that our culture is saturated with religious influences and that an effectual educational system cannot leave the student wholly ignorant of the currents of religious thought. But the point at which "instruction turns to proselyting and imparting knowledge becomes evangelism is, except in the crudest cases, a subtle inquiry." Id. at 236. 6. Cantwell v.

Though the state may not undertake religious in- struction nor blend secular and sectarian education nor use secular institu- tions to force one or some religion on any person, the government need not be hostile to religion or oppose efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence.'2 Thus where, pursuant to a state law, public schools at which attendance is compulsory are permitted to release students during school hours so that they may leave the schools and go to religious centers for devotional exercises, the children not released remaining in the class- rooms and those released being required to report for religious instruction, there is no interference with the free exercise of religion, since there is no coercion, direct or indirect, nor is there an establishment of religion.'3 However, a program which is similar except that the religion classes are held on the school premises is unconstitutional under the first amendment.14 9.

Moreover, tax funds may be expended in a general program designed to reimburse parents, regardless of their religion, for expenses incurred in transporting their children to and from accredited schools, Everson v.

"Here . . . the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules to a program of outside religious instruction." Id. at 315.

"[Bloth religion and government can best work to achieve their lofty aims if each is left free from the other within its respective sphere." Id. at 212. When the Court upheld a released time program in Zoracb, rupra note 13, three Justices dissented on the ground that there was no significant difference between the program before them and the one in McCollum. The primary objection of the dis- senters was that the state's compulsory public school machinery was being utilized to aid the religious sects by providing pupils for their religion classes, a procedure dis- approved by the majority in McCollum, supra at 212. Justice Frankfurter, in his separate concurring opinion in McCollum, noted the pressure upon children to attend the religion classes and observed that "the law of imitation operates, and non-con- formity is not an outstanding characteristic of children." Illinois ex rel. McCollum, supra at 227 (separate concurring opinion). Justice Jackson, dissenting in Zorach, ob- served that the children had two alternatives, to go to the religion classes or to remain</page><page sequence="5">1380 Virginia Law Review [Vol. 45 Most state courts, interpreting state constitutions, have approved Bible reading in the public schools,15 and the reading of the Old Testament alone'6 and of verses from the King James Bible'7 has been upheld by state courts interpreting the federal constitution. However, the action of a board of education in allowing distribution of Bibles which included the King James version of the New Testament to those public school students whose par- ents made a written request was held by the New Jersey Supreme Court to be an establishment of religion, contrary to the prohibition of the first and fourteenth amendments, since the King James Bible is unacceptable to in school. Thus, school served as a "temporary jail" for those who could not attend the religious instructions. Zorach v. Clauson, supra note 13, at 324 (dissenting opinion). However, Justice Jackson had previously remarked: "it may be doubted whether the Constitution which, of course, protects the right to dissent, can be construed also to protect one from the embarassment that always attends nonconformity..." Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., supra at 233 (concurring opinion). 15. Carden v.

The reasoning used in the state courts to show that Bible reading is constitutional is that: (1) the state constitutions were not intended to ban religion from the schools; (2) reading the Bible without comment is nonsectarian, since the Bible does not teach the peculiar tenets of one particular sect within the Christian religion; (3) conscientiously objecting pupils need not attend. See, e.g., Lewis v. Board of Educ., 157 Misc. 520, 285 N.Y. Supp. 164 (Sup. Ct. 1935), modified in other respects, 247 App. Div. 106, 286 N.Y.

Other courts, interpreting "sectarian" less narrowly to include non-Protestant or even non-Christian groups, have found that each version of the Bible is objectionable to at least one sect, and that reading the Bible in public schools is therefore preferring one sect over another. See Herold v. Parish Bd. of School Directors, 136 La. 1034, 68 So. 116 (1915); State ex rel. Weiss v. District Bd., 76 Wis. 177, 44 N.W. 967 (1890). Even where attendance was mandatory, Bible reading has been sustained. E.g., Church v. Bullock, 104 Tex. 1, 109 S.W. 115 (1908). Contra, e.g., People ex rel. Ring v. Board of Educ., 245 Ill. 334, 92 N.E. 251 (1910). Some courts have found that even though the objecting pupil is excused, he is stigmatized as a result of his beliefs and hence his religious freedom is infringed. Herold v. Parish Bd. of School Directors, supra. See also Kaplan v. Independent School Dist., 171 Minn. 142, 154, 214 N.W. 18, 22 ('1927) (dis- senting opinion). 16. Doremus v. Board of Educ., 5 N.J. 435, 75 A.2d 880 (1950), appeal dismissed, 342 U.S. 429 (1952). The New Jersey court found that the Old Testament was not a sectarian book when read without comment since it is accepted by the "three great religions," the Jewish, the Roman Catholic and the Protestant. Id. at 448, 75 A.2d at 886. The Supreme Court, without ruling on the merits, held that neither of the plain- tiffs had standing to raise the constitutional question before the Supreme Court. 342 U.S. 429. 17. Carden v. Bland, 199 Tenn. 665, 288 S.W.2d 718 (1956).</page><page sequence="6">1959] Recent Decisions 1381 Jews and Catholics and hence the distribution gave preference to one sect over another.'8 The instant decision by the first federal court to pass upon Bible reading in the public schools appears sound. The program was implemented by government employed teachers in state owned buildings, and it would seem to constitute more than a mere accommodation of religion or a permissible manifestation of this nation's theistic orientation. While ostensibly ad- hering to the doctrine of complete separation, the Supreme Court appears inclined to allow state aid to religion qua religion, though still opposing a preference to any one sect. Therefore, the principal issue in determining the constitutionality of Bible reading is whether the Bible is sectarian, for if it is, its use in opening exercises in public schools is a preference of one sect over another and unconstitutional as an establishment of religion. Though it may once have been proper to define "sect" narrowly, meaning groups within Protestantism, our population has become heterogeneous and there are many significant religious factions which, though believing in God, find the doctrines of the Protestant Bible objectionable or even hostile. Similarly, the Catholic or Jewish versions of the Bible are unacceptable to some. The state courts holding the Bible nonsectarian have utilized an obsolete definition of the term which the court in the instant case has properly discarded. However, where it is not mandatory that students attend the Bible reading exercises, it appears fallacious to find that religious freedom has been denied.'9 The protection of sectarian rights must not be carried to the point of purging the school curricula of everything which might be considered objectionable on religious grounds. It is suggested that in cases involving religion and the public schools two principles should be observed. First, where the possibly obnoxious practice is mandatory, there must be a grave and immediate danger to interests law- 18. Tudor v. Board of Educ., 14 N.J. 31, 100 A.2d 857 (1953), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 816 (1954). 19. Although the statute declared unconstitutional in the instant case did not expressly require each student to attend or participate in the Bible reading, the court reached its conclusion that the practices under it amounted to an establishment of religion and an interference with the free exercise of religion by the following reasoning: the Bible is essentially a religious document and its daily reading, buttressed by the authority of the state and the teachers, can hardly do less than inculcate or promote the inculcation of specific religious doctrines in the minds of children. The practice is, therefore, an establishment of religion since it is carried out by teachers during school hours in public school buildings. Likewise, although no sanctions are imposed upon the children by the statute, religious freedom is denied since: (1) the teachers must carry out the legislative mandate or be fired, hence they will exert all their influence to see that the intention of the legislature is accomplished; (2) the children are indirectly coerced, being required to attend school and subject to the authority of their teachers, receptive to their ideas, and apt to emulate them; (3) and parents have a right to teach their chil- dren according to their own religious beliefs or disbeliefs.</page><page sequence="7">1382 Virghina Law Review [Vol. 45 fully protected by the state in order to justify infringement of religious freedom. Secondly, where there is no coercion, a distinction should be made between that which is done primarily for educational purposes and that which is done for devotional purposes. In the latter instance, rights of minority groups other than atheists20 should be jealously guarded, and only the most general affirmation of belief in the Deity should be counte- nanced.2' For the state to go further in religious education is to enter the area rightfully reserved to church and home. 20. The atheist is protected by the Constitution from governmental encroachment on his religious freedom, but "he lives in a country where theism is in the warp and woof of the social and the governmental fabric and he has no authority to eradicate from governmental activities every vestige of the existence of God."
