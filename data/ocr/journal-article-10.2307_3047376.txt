<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAGNINI, VIGERIO, AND THE SISTINE CEILING: A REPLY FREDERICK HARTT In a recent article I pointed out certain discrepancies between the interpretations adduced by Mr. Edgar Wind in support of a theory regarding the meaning of the cycle of ancestors of Christ in the lunettes of the Sistine Chapel and the relevant texts as they are actually to be encountered.' Mr. Wind has replied by means of a comprehensive attack upon my article, closing with a renewed invitation to read the Isagogae of Sante Pagnini, which his "full bibliographical reference" and description "in detail . . . should enable any serious student to consult" (WAB, p. 46 n. 34). I have recently consulted the Isagogae,2 and am enabled to confirm the propriety of a celebrated quotation adopted by Mr. Wind to describe the relation between Pagnini and the Sistine Ceiling-"S'il n'existait pas, il faudrait l'inven- ter" (WGBA, p. 232). I am taken to task (WAB, p. 41) for "avoiding any reference" to the "large group of Renaissance sermons, tracts and anthologies" Mr. Wind mentions in his previous article (WGBA, p. 225 n. 39). This criticism would be more relevant had Mr. Wind himself ever quoted from these sources, but the reader will find only two page references, and not a syllable quoted or para- phrased from a single one of these sermons, tracts, and i. I shall make use of the following bibliographical indica- tions: HAB: Frederick Hartt, "Lignum Vitae in Medio Para- disi, the Stanza d'Eliodoro and the Sistine Ceiling," ART BULLETIN, XXXII, 1950, pp. 115- 145 and I81-218.

I wish to express my gratitude to Washington University for a post-doctoral fellowship during the summer of 1957, which enabled me to carry out research in Europe on other projects and, at the same time, to consult the Isagogae in the British Museum Library and the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence. My colleague, Prof. Philip de Lacy, has kindly checked my Latin translations.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES 263 anthologies, ostensibly (although Mr. Wind avoids stating this exactly) the basis for his arguments. The following crucial statements are wholly unsupported: "The genealogy is a recurrent subject for sermons on the vices and virtues" (WGBA, p. 228); "Many of Michelangelo's interpretations correspond to those used in contemporary sermons" (WGBA, p. 230); "The 'coming of Christ' signified a battle of the Virtues against the Vices" (WGBA, p. 227). This "coming of Christ" Mr. Wind places at Easter, with a preparation during the forty days of Lent with which he connects the forty names of the ancestors.3 The correspondence between the days of Lent and the number of generations "is the reason why in many theological treatises, among others Pagnini's Isagogae, some of the problems of the Genealogy are discussed under Quadragesima." None of these treatises is cited. Worse, in the Isagogae, Quadragesima does not occur as a heading at all; the forty ancestors are mentioned under Quadraginta. Pagnini cites no conflict between virtues and vices in connection with the ancestors, and the generations are compared numerically with "that season which leads laboriously toward Christ," but without the slightest reference to a Psychomachia.4 The statement that "Michelangelo himself also thought of a quadragesimal cycle, as is proved [italics mine] by his selection of prophets," is left unadorned. According to Mr. Wind "in Michelangelo's plan a picture of a vice appears opposite to each picture of a virtue, both of them signified by Hebrew names." One would assume that all forty ancestors had been tabu- lated, and found to consist of twenty vices and twenty virtues. Yet just six are interpreted, of which only two face each other directly. What about the other thirty- four? They were not mentioned in the original article nor in the recent comments. Mr. Wind's method of obtaining this fragmentary documentation invites analysis. "To extract the secret from a Hebrew name it is first necessary to find the Latin equivalent in the Onomasticon of St. Jerome (or in the appendix of a Renaissance Bible). The Latin translation, which generally consists of one or two words, for example, magister confusionis for the name Zorobabel, makes little sense unless a passage is found in the Bible in which these words are expanded into a full sentence . . . for example, 'deus non est magister confusionis sed pacis' (I Corinthians xIv, 37)." Are we to understand, then, that a twentieth century scholar, by means of "a drill in the use of the Concordance," can find the passages considered relevant in the six- teenth? I have already pointed out the obvious loopholes in Mr. Wind's "game of riddles" (HAB, p. 203 n. I61). It is puzzling, therefore, that Mr. Wind, while complaining that I leave "the reader with the impression that the extremely speculative method employed in these Renaissance texts had been" his "own invention," can do no better than refer us back to the pages in his previous study in which none of these Renaissance texts was quoted. Sante Pagnini, for example, gives no one carte blanche to pick his own passages from a Con- cordance, and although he is eloquent on the utility of knowing the meanings of Hebrew names, he provides no rules for Mr. Wind's game.5 The meanings given by St. Jerome and by Renais- sance Bibless for the six interpreted ancestors are not identical with those provided by Mr. Wind7 which enable him to find passages that transform Aminadab, Boaz, and Jechonias from virtues into vices. "My volun- tary people" becomes "My people have forgotten me days without number," hence the "vices of worldliness and oblivion." "In whom is wood, or in him is forti- tude, or in fortitude"' turns out to be the "vice of idolatry."9 And "preparing, or preparation of the Lord" is presented as Discordia (WGBA, p. 230). No explana- tion has yet been offered save that the "discovery of the relevance of the Hebrew names on Michelangelo's tablets was based on a comparative study of Renaissance sermons and commentaries [italics mine]" (WAB, p. 42). II "For a full statement of the vice associated with Aminadab" Mr. Wind refers us to "St. Gregory's Commentary to Canticles vI, 12, where the words of the bride, 'Nescivi, anima mea conturbavit me propter quadrigas Aminadab' are paraphrased as signifying the darkness of ignorance. . . ." I pointed out that Mr. Wind omitted the rest of the passage in which the Quadrigae Aminadab, so far from signifying a vice, foreshadow the four gospels of Christ which disturbed the Synagogue.'x Moreover, Pagnini, when interro- gated on the subject of Aminadab, testified firmly against Mr. Wind," quoting word for word the pas- sage in Gregory which Mr. Wind had omitted, and 3. Although during Lent Christ was on earth, and although Easter is not his coming but his Resurrection and the prepara- tion for his departure. 4. Isagogae, p. 725. 5. The most mysterious aspect of the situation is the fact that on page 46, WAB, Mr. Wind quotes my statement that he "never once quotes" from Pagnini, and still sees nothing wrong with his method. 6. Witness the Bibles cited in my note 16I, HAB, p. 203. 7.

I have already pointed out the connection between robur and Rovere, (HAB, p. 0o6 n. 174), and the fact that in the Stanza della Segnatura Fortitudo holds fast to a little rovere tree. 9. Through what clairvoyance can Boaz be described as a "mad, superstitious carpenter engaged upon a journey" (WCBA, p. 229), when he has no carpenter's tools and is sitting down? x o.

Isagogae, p. 727.</page><page sequence="3">264 THE ART BULLETIN concluding that "this Aminadab is Christ," and that the "chariots of Aminadab are the four gospels."'2 If Mr. Wind still wants to convict Aminadab of oblivion, or ignorance, or some other vice, he will have to find another witness than Pagnini. While perusing Pagnini I discovered a possible source for Mr. Wind's version of the translation of Naason. Under the word "aenigma" Pagnini quotes St. Augus- tine's remarks on the famous passage from I Corinthians xiiI, "Videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate."'3 The name of Naason never turns up in this connec- tion, nor have I been able to find it elsewhere in the Isagogae. Apparently Mr. Wind utilized this passage on "aenigma" to explain the mirror (speculum) held by Naason's wife. He is as yet unimpressed that an ancestor whose name means serpent is placed by Michelangelo under the Brazen Serpent.'4 Mr. Wind (WGBA, p. 23I) explains "why Josaphat . is represented as writing. According to Pagnini, the moralization of ipse judicans is to be found in Job xxxI, 35: librum scribat ipse qui judicat (let him who judges also write the book)." The actual passage from Pagnini (for which Mr. Wind gave no page reference) taken from an entirely different context, makes no allu- sion to Josaphat or to the phrase "ipse judicans."'5 III The case of Jechonias and Salathiel (Fig. 5) is even more instructive. "His picture of Jechonias (which is translated as preparans) illustrates the vice of Discordia, and shows a vigorously quarreling couple whose chil- dren play with a little stone. The 'Stone of Jechonias' as a symbol of preparans occurs in a rather obscure pas- sage of St. Gregory in which he discusses this particular Ancestor of Christ, but which does not seem to have influenced any of the classical Renaissance sermons on the Genealogy" (WGBA, p. 230). I pointed out (HAB, p. 2IO n. 194) numerous objections, chiefly that the small and shapeless object is probably not a stone,'e certainly not the cornerstone Gregory refers to, from Psalm cxvIImI,7 and that Mr. Wind interpreted the entire lunette as Jechonias, in text and in captions, indi- cating nowhere that Salathiel's name also appears there. Mr. Wind now states that he did not mention Salathiel because he was "explaining the name Jechonias," and that I was trying to "disprove Pagnini's," not his "in- terpretation of Gregory's passage on Jechonias." Actually at one point Pagnini quotes from Gregory the precise phtases which Mr. Wind omits and in which, as I stated, "Jechonias is the type of the corner- stone because of his crucial position at the end of one group of fourteen and the beginning of another, and because he is King at the beginning of the Babylonian captivity" (HAB, p. 2 I n. 194).18 A second passage from Pagnini characterizes Jechonias, the supposed allegory of Discord, in these words: "Jechonias, where the cornerstone is prefigured by him, is to be interpreted as the preparation of God."'9 IV "If we are to comprehend the particular shade of religious doctrine expressed in Michelangelo's frescoes of the Sistine Ceiling, we shall find it less in Savona- rola's own writings than in those of the learned Sante Pagnini who," Mr. Wind writes (WGBA, p. 215, and n. 13) ". . . appears to have been the favorite theologian of Julius II himself." This assertion"2 is supported solely by the citation of a Life of Pagnini without page refer- ence.21 In a later article,22 Mr. Wind repeats the claim, declaring that Pagnini's "Isagogae ... was deliberately composed after the model of St. Augustine. By the time Michelangelo came to Rome, this was the official theology of the papal court." A scholar proposing such a thesis might feel obliged to demonstrate the presence of Sante Pagnini at the papal court at least once, his intimacy with the Pope, 12. loc.cit., "Iste Aminadab Christus est, &amp; huius quadrigae collisae sunt in plateis, occurrentes occurrentibus sibi quadrigis superbi huius saeculi. .... Quadrigae Aminadab quatuor sunt Evangelia, de quibus nobis contra Ninivem quatuor magna praedicantur sacramenta, incarnatio ipsius Aminadab, cuius facies, facies est hominis, passio eiusdem, quae facies est vituli, resurrectio eius, quae facies est facies leonis, ascensio eiusdem, quae facies est aquilae volantis." 13. ibid., p. 17, "De aenigmate autem, &amp; tropicis locutionibus rursus Augustinus libro de trinitate decimoquinto, capite nono, hoc pacto scribit, enarrans illud Apostolium, Videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate." 14. cf. below, sec. vin for the exact correspondence as drawn by Hrabanus between the Serpent of Naason and the Brazen Serpent. I5. Isagogae, p. 480, "Quid liber mystice significet, divus insinuat Gregorius libro Moralium 22, capite 19, exponens illud lob, Et librum scribat ipse qui iudicat." 16. On page 2 10, HAB, I stated the possibility that the small object is a piece of bread, "like the loaf in the Ozias spandrel and the piece which Solomon gives to David on a plate." 17. Appearing with Jonah cast up by the whale, and Samson carrying the gates of Gaza in most editions of the Speculum Humanae Salvationis. 18. Moralia in Job, Migne, LxxvI, col. 459. If Mr. Wind's "obscure" refers to Gregory's meaning, surely that is clear enough. And if the work itself is characterized as obscure, why is its title lettered on the volume at Gregory's feet in the Disputa? The passage reads, "De hoc lapide per Prophetam dicitur: Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes, hic factus est in caput anguli (Psalm CXVII, 22). Huius lapidis typum Jechonias rex tenuit, quem Matthaeus dum quaterdenas genera- tiones describeret, secundo numeravit. Quem enim fini secundae, ipsum rursum initio tertiae generationis inseruit. Ipse namque in Babyloniam cum Israelitica plebe migratus est, qui dum ab aliis ad alia ducitur, pro utriusque parietis latere non immerito secundo numeratur. Cuius migrationis flexu angularem lapidem designat." Quoted Isagogae, p. 444. I9. ibid., p. 725, "Et hoc ipsum iam praefigurabat Christum a circumcisione ad praeputium, tanquam ad Hierusalem, ad Babyloniam quodammodo migraturum, &amp; hinc, atque hinc utrisque in se credentibus tanquam lapidem angularem futurum. Haec tunc in figura praeparabat Deus, rebus in veritate venturis. Nam &amp; ipse lechonias, ubi angulus iste praefiguratus est, interpretatur praeparatio Dei." 20. Mr. Wind's often conflicting assertions regarding Sante Pagnini's importance scarcely present a coherent picture of his theory. 21.

Yet no attempt of this sort is ever made. Instead Mr. Wind recounts to us what the Pope did not do for Sante Pagnini (WGBA, p. 231): "Julius II wished to make him a cardinal, but was thwarted in this attempt by the Sacred College. The characteristic manner in which the enterprise failed leaves no doubt that Pagnini was the Pope's personal candidate."23 In the accompanying note we are referred to Pastor for "the stormy discussions attending the nomination of cardinals under Julius II." Mr. Wind's elusive wording tempted me to look up the biography; it proved to consist of only 74 tiny pages, written in a style whose effusive vagueness does not disguise its author's lack of precise information.24 Few actual events of Pagnini's life are mentioned. On page 24 is a reference to the great honors Julius wanted to bestow on Pagnini, and on page 61 appears this jewel: "In an old manuscript book, entitled History of Lucca by M. Nicol6 Tucci . . . the following words are read in the ninth volume, at folio 380. . .. At the death of Pope Pius III was assumed Julius II, great friend and protector of the Lucchese, at whose instance25 he pro- moted to the dignity of the Cardinalate Galeotto Fran- ciotti, their bishop and citizen ... and it was hoped that he would assume also the following year"6 SANTI PAGNINO [italics mine] also Lucchese, unique and most famous theologian of that time, if envy, inseparable enemy of virtue, had not at the same time kept from them that favor and from him that reward due to his virtuous labors."27 This is the sole evidence for the characterization of Pagnini as the Pope's "prote6g," "personal candidate" and "favorite theologian." As for "the characteristic manner in which the enterprise failed," that is quite simple. It never took place at all, as is shown by Mr. Wind's own references to Pastor.28 Although the col- lege of cardinals often opposed Julius' nominations because they wanted to keep their number as small as possible, they succeeded only once, on November I2, 1505, and in the case of only one candidate.29 On the chance that this disappointed individual might still have been Sante Pagnini, I looked up the name, not given by Pastor but easy to determine from the sources he cites. Burchard presented the list of the ten names nominated by Julius II;30 Sanudo, the nine actually confirmed by the Sacred College.3' The name present on the proposed list but missing from the appointments should be that of the unsuccessful candidate. It was Bandinello Sauli, papal secretary and protonotary,a2 whom the Pope finally did get appointed in the fourth list, March I o, 1511. V Mr. Wind has warned us that "in the hands of a casual historian of art" the Isagogae of Sante Pagnini "might easily share the fate of Ripa's Iconologia, for the subjects are presented in alphabetical order, and spurious knowledge can be quickly acquired. But the danger is mitigated by the defects of the system. The alphabetical arrangement hides rather than reveals the richest treasures .... No obvious reference, for instance, indicates that the book gives decisive information on that most tantalizing problem of the Sistine Ceiling, Michel- angelo's representation of the Ancestors of Christ" (WGBA, pp. 217-218). Mr. Wind does not limit his admiration to the defenses offered by the Isagogae, a folio volume of 858 pages. He refers us also to the unpublished manuscripts of Egidio da Viterbo, and to the destroyed manuscripts of Sante Pagnini (WAB, p. 47 n. 36), presumably impregnable. Let us examine the treasures hoarded by the Isagogae, described as "an encyclopedic attempt to codify the mystical interpretations of Scripture, . . . a great alle- gorical superstructure on his grammatical labors. .... Though rarely quoted and soon forgotten, the book represents the biblical Summa of the Italian Renais- sance" (WGBA, p. 217). It comes as a surprise to discover that the Isagogae is nothing but a dictionary of the mystical meanings of nouns used in the Bible, beginning with abyssus and ending with uxor. If you wish to find out the mystical connotations of, shall we say, "book," or "sword," or "cock," or the number forty, all you have to do is look it up. Each article, usually about two pages long, begins with the same formula, e.g. (p. 498), "Quid lilium mystice significet." The meanings are justified by pas- sages from the Old and New Testaments, the four Church Fathers, and a handful of other theologians. Judging from the limited number of authors he cites, 23. For this statement the same biography is cited as for the first, and also without page reference. 24. Note for example on page 36 his new Pope, "Adriano settimo, che succede a Leone." 25. A further instance of ignorance. Julius II appointed Franciotti among the first two cardinals, on November 29, 1503, because he was the son of the Pope's sister, Lucchina. Cf. Pastor, History of the Popes, St. Louis, 1923, vI, p. 219. The bishopric of Lucca was only one of his many benefices; Fran- ciotti's principal position was papal vice-chancellor. 26. No cardinals were nominated "the following year" (1504). 27. "In un libro antico manoscritto, che s'intitola Historie di Lucca di M.

It is scarcely a surprise, in view of the Pope's preference for his fellow countrymen, to discover that Sauli was a Genoese.</page><page sequence="5">266 THE ART BULLETIN Pagnini's knowledge of theological literature does not seem unusually detailed.33 Nor does Pagnini, cited as "supplying decisive in- formation" about the Genealogy of Christ on the Sistine Ceiling, quote a single word from Matthew I, as far as I have been able to discover. Only a few of the ancestors are mentioned in the Isagogae, and then only those found in the Old Testament, and in support of arguments concerning other subjects. Mr. Wind re- counts eloquently "the obstacles attending any attempt to reconstruct the theology of Julius II. A toilsome discipline is required to touch only the periphery of the subject" (WAB, p. 47)." The wayfarer toward this Parnassus may well stop short of Pagnini. The Isagogae is not a theology at all, nor does it pretend to be one, and there is no evidence to show that it has any more to do with Julius II, who died twenty-three years before its publication, than had its Dominican author. If we are to believe Mr. Wind, Symphorien Champier in his preface "declared it to represent the accumulated labors of Pagnini's life" (WGBA, p. 217). "Its size, its content, and the editorial preface by Symphorien Cham- pier, all indicate that it is the final statement of theories which he had entertained over a lifetime" (WAB, p. 46). Unfortunately, there is not a word to this effect in Champier's preface. Indeed the only phrases in which the compilation of the Isagogae is mentioned indicate rather the reverse-that the work was done in France at the end of Pagnini's life.35 And if Pagnini "can be proved to have held a key position during the time in which the Sistine Ceiling was painted" (WAB, p. 46), is it not strange that such sensitive instruments as Hefele-Hergenrather, Pastor, Ranke, and Creighton should not record a single wit- ness of his presence in Rome, his correspondence with the Papacy, or even his existence, among the hundreds of separate personalities with whom their comprehensive histories deal during the reign of Julius II? The answer is simple enough. Only under Leo X did this obscure Hebraist turn up in Rome."3 Incidentally, why, if the meanings of the Hebrew names of the ancestors are generally to be encountered in the back of a Renais- sance printed Bible, should the intervention of a Hebraist be necessary at all?37 Finally, a Hebraist who spent several pages (Isagogae, pp. 43ff.) demonstrating that it was both ridiculous and impious to believe that God possesses "nostrils, teeth, beard and those inner and outer members which to us are necessary," would scarcely seem appropriate to the interpretation of the Sistine Ceiling in which the Lord appears five times in complete anthropomorphic guise. Mr. Wind is concerned that Vigerio is "the only theologian of the sixteenth century from whom Mr. Hartt professes to have obtained any illumination at all." It is not necessarily the number of contemporary sources listed in footnotes but the relevancy of their doctrines which provides support for a given argument. I quoted extensively from sources republished in the early sixteenth century, and from the Opuscula of Barbieri, printed a few years before the opening of the sixteenth century, dedicated to Sixtus IV, coeval with the first cycle of frescoes in the Sistine Chapel, and thus of importance to the interpretation of the ceiling. I quoted passages and reproduced illustrations from the Opera nuova contemplativa, a popular devotional work published about 15 10 when the work on the ceiling was in full swing. I produced a multitude of sixteenth cen- tury texts to illustrate the political program and spiritual aims of Julius II. To Mr. Wind the "oratorical pas- sages" I quote from the proceedings of the Lateran Council "are not . . . theological arguments." Since these phrases were delivered in solemn council and in his very presence, one can only conclude that the Pope was less fastidious than Mr. Wind. The treasures of Pagnini's Isagogae have been de- fended against the "dross" (WAB, p. 45), the "drab and sterile . . . writing" of Vigerio, "half argument, half incantation" (WAB, p. 43). This substitution of personal taste for scholarly argument"3 is surpassed by the passage in which Mr. Wind contends that Vigerio, born in 1446, was "out-fashioned" in I5o8, and that the "concetto of the Sistine Ceiling . . . would be . . . inconceivable in the generation to which Vigerio be- longs" (WAB, p. 44). One might as easily argue that St. Peter's was a retardataire building because Bramante was also born in 1446, or present as a hopeless reac- tionary Julius II himself-born in 1444! Whereas Mr. Wind has yet produced no evidence 33. Pagnini might well have rejoiced, for example, at the possession of the indices of Migne. Although these provide more than five thousand columns of closely packed allusions to patristic and scholastic opinion on every conceivable subject, Mr. Wind finds them "not an adequate instrument for working out the typology of the Sistine Ceiling" (WAB, p. 47). My chief reason for stating so emphatically my reliance on Migne's indices was my shock at Mr. Wind's cult of inaccessibility, but it should have been clear from the numerous quotations that the references given by these indices have all been checked and analyzed, and that these are the actual opinions of historic theology. No art historian can find his way around the 242 volumes of Migne's Patrologia Latina without the help of the monumental indices, whose study would have provided Mr. Wind with a less capricious substitute for his "game of riddles" based on the Concordance. 34. The heart of the subject apparently exacts no such tire- some labors, for Mr. Wind (WAB, p. 45) devotes a long paragraph to "Julian theology" without any references what- soever. 35. Isagogae, cij, "Modo autem aedidit Isagogas ad sacras literas, &amp; ad mysticos sacrae scripturae sensus, quas ad tuam dominationem [referring to Cardinal Francois de Tournon to whom the work was dedicated] idem santes noster brevi mis- surus est." 36. The linguistic interests of Leo X need scarcely be stressed. It is important in this respect to point out that he fostered the establishment of a Hebrew printing press in Rome, and gave posts to learned Jews at the papal court; cf. Pastor, oP.cit., VII, pp. 444-445 also p. 252, note *, for his interest in Pagnini's Bible. 37. cf. WGBA, p. 214, repeated WAB, p. 46. 38. Particularly inconsistent when in unguarded moments Mr. Wind refers to "the more labored pursuits" of Savonarola's pupils, including Pagnini (WGBA, p. 215), and the latter's "rarefied and tortuous intellect" (WGBA, p. 232).</page><page sequence="6">NOTES 267 that Julius II ever heard of Pagnini,39 Vigerio was a contemporary, a fellow-countryman, a fellow-Fran- ciscan, an old family friend and a trusted intimate of the Pope. He was made bishop of Sinigaglia by Sixtus IV. On November 12, 1503, only ten days after his election as Pope and a fortnight before his coronation, at a time when his regime was seriously threatened by Cesare Borgia, Julius II placed the Castel Sant'Angelo, the key to the fortifications of the Vatican, in the hands of Vigerio as Castellano. Vigerio's name heads the first comprehensive list of cardinals created (successfully) by the Pope in 1505. In 1511, at the moment when Julius II's authority was in greatest danger, Vigerio was among the twenty loyal cardinals in Rome who signed the Bull proclaiming the convocation of the Lateran Council. When the Council, the crowning achievement of the reign of Julius II, was actually con- voked, Vigerio celebrated the High Mass which opened its third session on December 3, 15 I I.o4 Furthermore, even if the Isagogae could be shown to have any direct relevancy to the Sistine Ceiling, which it cannot, I should prefer a sumptuous volume printed the year before the ceiling was commenced and officially dedi- cated to the Pope himself4' to a treatise published almost a generation later in another country-"rarely quoted and soon forgotten" (WGBA, p. 217). The religious life consists not solely of theological riddles, but also of conviction, of passionate belief. Yet Mr. Wind finds nothing more than "incantations" in the Decachordum Christianum, from whose pages faith radiates. My claims concerning the rising Adam and the naked sons of Noah42 have been characterized as the only "positive information not found elsewhere." The evidence I have brought forward is too extensive to be thus shrugged aside. What seems significant is that so much of the content of the Sistine Ceiling, explicable separately through widely scattered mediaeval sources, is found all at once in this single High Renaissance work.43 VI Mr. Wind erroneously states that "Book II, Chapter Iv" of Vigerio "is not quoted by Mr. Hartt, although it is entitled The Agreement between the Beginnings of the New and Old Testaments" (WAB, p. 44).44 But the passage which he declares to "disprove" me "completely" begins thus: "Our most wise mother, the Holy Catholic Church, decided at the beginning to give milk to her children because they could not yet nourish themselves with solid food." Finding that Vigerio here characterizes the opening chapter of Matthew as "milk for babes," Mr. Wind maintains that "had the author wished to write theological polemics against the program of the Sistine Ceiling he could not have chosen a more crucial topic." Are we to believe that a Renaissance ecclesiastic would write of any passage in the Scriptures with the disrespect implied by the modern term "milk for babes," and then dedicate the work to the Pope? Mr. Wind himself, in a lecture on the Sistine Ceiling, pointed out how Cumaea, the sibyl of the Roman mys- teries, is represented with immense breasts in reference to the divine milk of Mary-Ecclesia, with which the Child is to be nourished and which will become the Sacred Blood giving life to the faithful.45 The metaphor of the Church providing its children with milk is strikingly relevant to a cycle of forty generations, almost every one of which is centered about a small child, and in eighteen of which mothers appear in tender relations with their children. Joram and Ozias, indeed, are both shown as drinking from their mothers' breasts."4 In calling this passage to my atten- tion Mr. Wind has inadvertently provided an example of an exact illustration by Michelangelo of Vigerio's text: Ozias' mother withholds bread from her child while giving him her breast instead, just as Vigerio has described. I have previously pointed out the instances of Salathiel and of Achim who, if my interpretation is correct, are also stretching out their hands for bread. Now Vigerio uses for the literal Matthew the same 39. I do not except the twice repeated fallacy (implied WGBA, pp. 212-215, et passim, and stated specifically WAB, p. 46) that because there might have been a "secret corre- spondence" (for which Mr. Wind produces no evidence) be- tween Julius II when still cardinal, and Girolamo Savonarola in 1494, ipso facto the Pope knew Savonarola's successor at San Marco fourteen years later. This is guilt by association. 40. Hefele-Hergenr6ther, op.cit., vIII, pp. 397, 409, 458, 525; Pastor, op.cit., vi, pp. 221, 427. 41. I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Mr. Harry B. Gutman, from whose "Medieval Content of Raphael's 'School of Athens,' " Journal of the History of Ideas, 11, i941, pp. 420-429, I learned the name of Vigerio and the title of his Decachordum Christianum. As far as I know, Mr. Gutman's article is the first attempt to deduce the consequences of Julius' Franciscanism for Renaissance art. 42. Mr. Wind disputes the relevancy of this text which denounces the naked and impenitent thief reviling the naked Christ on the Cross, likening him to Ham deriding the naked Noah, "as on that particular theory only one of the three sons (Ham) should be naked, but in Michelangelo the two others are naked as well." Mr. Wind can scarcely have read the pas- sage I quoted in which Vigerio first compares himself to the penitent thief in these words, "offero me nudum tecum in cruce," and then cries "Assimila me domine Sem et Japhet." This seems to take care of the nakedness of both sons. 43. cf. specific relationships drawn between the Decachor- dum, and Julian iconography in general and the Stanza d'Eliodoro and the Sistine Ceiling in particular, HAB, p. 122 and n. 47, p. 129 and nn. ioo and xox, p. 137 and n. 144, PP. 181-182, 185, and n. 41, pp. 189-191, 196, 199-201. The statement that this information might "be found elsewhere" is perfectly true. In my two articles I have attempted to trace the traditional authorities for my interpretations before "adorning" them (WAB, p. 47) with the appropriate quotations from Vigerio. One might quote from Mr. Wind (WGBA, p. 23 ): "Now it is highly unlikely that Michelangelo compiled the arguments for his pictures from a multiplicity of different books. . . . The more likely hypothesis is that he availed himself of the advice of an experienced theologian." 44. On p. 196 I quoted the entire passage producing a con- cordance between the beginnings of the book of Genesis and the Gospel of St. John in the form of a dialogue. 45. I pointed out (HAB, p. 189 and n. 72) that according to one tradition the Cumaean sibyl was called Amalthea, like the she-goat which suckled Jupiter. 46. I propose to discuss the general topic of milk symbolism at greater length in an article on Michelangelo's Medici Chapel to appear in the Festschrift flir Georg Swarzenski.</page><page sequence="7">268 THE ART BULLETIN metaphor Hrabanus employed for the literal interpreta- tion in general. "Through these Wisdom feeds her children. To those who are young and beginning to learn she gives the milk of history; to those advancing in the faith the bread of allegory; those who are truly and constantly doing good so that they abound therein she satisfies with the savory repast of tropology, while finally, those who despise earthly things and ardently desire the heavenly, she fills to the full with the wine of anagogy."'' Maternal milk and allegorical bread are represented in the spandrels and lunettes, while the mystic cycle in the center of the ceiling commences with the inebriating wine, with which Noah is "filled to the full." The placing of the temporal ancestors drawn from Matthew in a position so dim that Tolnay was able to refer to it as the "zone of shadow and death" while the Word and the World in the central scenes begin in the same mighty act of divine will is in complete harmony with Vigerio's opinion of the relative importance of the literal Matthew and the mystical John "on whom the whole structure of our Catholic religion rises" (Deca- chordum, fol. 29r). VII The ancestor figures on either side of the tablet in each lunette are so grouped as to resemble a family in- cluding (apparently) both parents and a child or two, as in the spandrels above. Mr. Wind insists (WAB, p. 41) that I have "split some of the families vertically in half, producing two families out of one," since I have assumed that in many instances the generations are shown at widely separated moments in time. Thus an ancestor in one generation may be represented as a child, while his son on the other side of the lunette is shown as a grown man. Mr. Wind's point would be well taken if he could demonstrate that in each lunette without exception there is the same grouping of mother, father, and child or children. However, Abia and his wife have no child, save for that which the young woman bears within her, nor is there a child in either the Aminadab or the Naason lunettes. Both the Joseph- Jacob and Eleazar-Matthan lunettes contain two dis- tinct families, each consisting of father, mother, and at least one child. Worse yet, the two (destroyed) lunettes above the altar exhibit entirely irregular combinations. The Phares-Esron-Aram group shows a man, a woman, and a child on one side, a man and a woman on the other. And into the first lunette four generations are crowded, including one old man, one young man, one woman, and two children. If Mr. Wind's assumption were correct, we ought to find Abraham an old man, Isaac in middle age, Jacob a young man, and Judah a child. All these conditions are satisfied save one: Isaac is shown as a child. Thus the situation which excited such amusement in Mr. Wind has indisputably materialized: "the child [Isaac] is father to the man [Jacob]." Mr. Wind can there- fore no longer object to the inclusion of different moments in time within the same field, a phenomenon he might have noticed elsewhere in the ceiling."s It is wholly natural that this principle should be followed in all cases where there are children on both sides of the same lunette. In all such instances only one parent has been shown in each generation. This princi- ple is the only way to account for the existence of chil- dren on both sides of so many lunettes. We could not otherwise determine on which child the succession falls. Moreover, as the reader may verify by my plan (HAB, p. 202), it is the only way of preserving a consecutive succession of ancestors from Abraham to Christ without skips or reversals, a matter of some relevance in a genealogy.49 It is important for the understanding of the icono- graphical traditions flowing through the Sistine Ceiling that the only monumental pictorial cycle of all the an- cestors listed in Matthew I (as distinguished from Trees of Jesse with varying numbers of ancestors) that I have been able to find in Italy is in the chapel of the Beato Luca Belludi at the Basilica of Sant' Antonio in Padua,50 a Franciscan foundation, where it is combined with a cycle of Franciscan miracles. This should scarcely be surprising, in view of the emphasis laid by St. Francis on the humanity of Christ. VIII From the vantage point of an interpretation of forty names based on an analysis of only six, Mr. Wind at- tempts (WAB, p. 41) to demolish the text I have produced for all forty, by attacking two. In the first instance, Esron, I had already pointed out that the meaning of the name had "slight application to the program of the ceiling" (HAB, p. 204). To Mr. Wind 47. cf. below, sec. xi, for the questions raised by Mr. Wind regarding the use of the term "anagogy." 48. As in the Creation of Sun, Moon, and Plants, the Fall of Man, the Drunkenness of Noah, and the Crucifixion of Haman; commissioned by a Pope who had himself represented as present at events which occurred many centuries before, and ordered frescoes showing personages who lived as much as a millennium apart, engaged in solemn disputation. 49. In Mr. Wind's article the growth of a cult of the ancestry of Christ is persuasively demonstrated (WGBA, pp. 22off.), but so gentle is the transition from this discussion to the specific treatment of the ancestors listed in Matthew I, that the reader is scarcely aware that all the illustrations (figs. 7-1o) refer not to the genealogy of Christ through Joseph as in Matthew, but to the family of Mary, especially those members alive at the time of Christ's infancy. At no time is this dis- crepancy admitted. The confusion is confounded, and crystal- lized, on p. 232 n. 49: "Goritz's commission, for S. Agostino in Rome, of Raphael's fresco painting of the prophet Isaiah with Sansovino's group of St. Anne placed below . . . repeats a configuration of the Sistine Ceiling by placing the Prophet above the Genealogy." It ought to be made clear which genealogy is being treated. Yet Mr. Wind utilizes this lapse to solemnize a matrimony between the style of Michelangelo's genre-like ancestor frescoes and the Torgauer Altar of Cranach, through the proxy of Goritz, because he was a Luxembourger and thus a presumed intermediary between north and south. 50. cf.

In the case of Josaphat,"1 Mr. Wind rebukes me for referring to "a passage in Ezechiel (Ix, 2) of which not one word is to be found in Hrabanus." Yet the passage is to be found in Hrabanus. I pointed out that Josaphat is in "the first lunette inside the sanctuary, and is placed opposite Ezekiel, who heard the command of the Lord to set the mark Tau upon the heads of the faithful, issued to a 'man clothed with linen, who had the writer's inkhorn by his side.' " I presumed the reader would remember my analysis of Ezekiel on page I89, which Mr. Wind seems not to have read. Here I laid some stress on this passage, quoted from Hrabanus Maurus, De Laudibus Sanctae Crucis, Migne, cvII, cols. 245 and 253. My interpretation of the Ceiling without the ances- tors was complete before I came upon Hrabanus' text, and I was astonished to find almost all of my interpreta- tions of the scenes corroborated by the meanings given for the ancestors.52 Mr. Wind contends that Hrabanus is an unlikely source for the Sistine Ceiling, yet sometimes one has to look in unlikely places. He is wrong when he characterizes the Commentarium in Matthaeum as "not outstanding either for the singularity or the wealth . . . of its propositions." Among all the commentaries on Matthew listed by the Indices to Migne only six make a systematic attempt at supplying passages from Scripture to amplify the meanings of the ancestral names and among these Hrabanus is one of the fullest and most complex. Four of the six can be ruled out at once, because, in addition to other deviations, they do not illustrate the parallel between Naason, translated as "serpent," and the prophecy of the Brazen Serpent represented directly above him by Michelangelo.53 Now the only other commentary which gives the meaning serpens and the passage from John III, 14, in which Christ compares himself to the serpent lifted up in the wilderness, is a rudimentary work by Christian Druth- mar, in which only fifteen of the forty ancestors receive scriptural passages, and two are not even translated."5 Hrabanus would seem to be left in possession of the field. The Sistine cycle may have been drawn from a later derivative of Hrabanus' commentary unknown to me, but what cannot be maintained is that Hrabanus' text does not fit the paintings. IX "As for Sixtus himself," we are told (WAB, p. 45), "Mr. Hartt is gravely mistaken when he attributes (p. 2Io) to the 'beloved uncle, Sixtus IV' a 'special eucharistic devotion' on the grounds that he 'had writ- ten a treatise on the blood of Christ' which 'was ap- parently an outgrowth of the dispute before Pius II.'"' In that famous disputation (1462) Francesco della Rovere, later Sixtus IV, maintained the negative and held that the blood of Christ, when separated from the body, was not deserving of veneration." The Com- mentaries of Pius II,58 which Mr. Wind mentions without quotations or page references, do not bear him out. "The preachers proposed the conclusion ... in this manner: the precious blood of Our Lord shed in the Passion, which returned at last to the glorified body was at no time deprived of hypostatic union with the Word. The minorites affirmed that this union ceased during the three days of the Passion." This is a quite different proposal. Sixtus maintains that the actual blood shed during the Passion "if it had retained union would by no means have been corrupted, but everywhere . . . would have persisted without corruption and have been deserving of worship in a cult of adoration. However, it is exhibited in the Lateran, in Venice, in Mantua, and in many other places reduced to ashes and corrupt. Therefore it did not retain union." Mr. Wind claims the debate "concerned the ques- tion of worshipping any relics of the Sacred Blood, and more generally the growing fashion of stressing the sanguineous aspects of redemption at the expense of all others. The demonstrable fact that Sixtus IV was 51. cf. above, for the surgery Mr. Wind performs upon this unfortunate ancestor. 52. I have previously stated (nAB, p. 203 n. 162) and reiterate here that "I have omitted those Biblical references in Hrabanus which seem irrelevant to the Sistine," since Hrabanus generally provides three quite different passages for each name. For the correspondences between the meanings given in Hrabanus for the ancestors and those I adduced for the scenes, I refer the reader to my article (HAB, pp. 201-213). 53. In fact all four of this family of commentaries give augurium as the sole meaning for Naason's name, and three of the four connect it with Matthew xxv, 31, referring to the Second Coming.

Druthmar makes no mention of Isaac carrying wood, yet Hrabanus describes him (col. 738) exactly as he was shown by Michelangelo, carrying wood, and directly above the altar, "quo mactandus ipse ad aram portaverat ligna, sicut Christus crucem passionis suae proprio gestavit corpore." Druthmar also makes Amon into "infidelis" instead of "fidelis," and con- sistently refers to "Nathan" instead of "Matthan." 55. I based my supposition of a special eucharistic devotion on the part of both Popes not only on the treatise by Sixtus IV, but on: (1) The ardent and universally known devotion of St. Francis to the eucharist, enjoined, one would imagine, on Francesco della Rovere as General of the Franciscan Order and on Giuliano della Rovere as Cardinal Protector. Mr. Wind (WAB, p. 42) finds this logic "rather difficult to follow." (2) The represented presence of Julius II at the miraculous mass of Bolsena, a circumstance scarcely to be deduced from Mr. Wind's arguments. (3) The fact that Sixtus IV granted special indulgence to those who would adore the bloodstained Corporal of Bolsena; cf. Pastor, op.cit., VI, p. 596 n +, cited HAB, p. 120 n. 33. (4) The fact that one of these Popes caused the other to be represented alongside the greatest of Franciscan theologians, St. Bonaventura, in the Disputa, the most complete pictorial exposition of the doctrine of the Eucharist. 56. ed. Rome, 1584, pp. 513, 522, 533. I am extremely grateful to Miss Florence Gragg for her kindness in locating and transcribing for me the appropriate passages, and for checking my translations.</page><page sequence="11">270 THE ART BULLETIN opposed to these developments shows how ill-fitting it is . . . to read those sanguineous features to which Sixtus objected into the plan of the Sistine Chapel." So far from being opposed to the veneration of relics of the Sacred Blood, Sixtus is willing that they be venerated like any other relics. "We do not destroy religion when we say that the blood which is shown . . . does not retain union with the Word, a statement proved by this very corruption. For we do not deny that that blood which the people worship was the blood of Christ, but we say either that it appeared miraculously or that it was shed otherwise than in the Passion." The obvious conclusion seems to be that only in the sacrament is entire union with the Word obtained, and possibly for that very reason Sixtus fostered the adoration of the Sacred Corporal of Bolsena.57 But the most striking confirmation of the validity of my contention concerning the importance of the "san- guineous features" in the Sistine Ceiling is furnished by the following paragraph on Michelangelo's Drunken- ness of Noah written by Mr. Wind.5s "Yet these very utensils... are wrought with extravagant overtones as they suggest the implements of a tragic ritual. The wine in the great tub signifies blood, and would have suited the fancy of St. Catherine of Siena who spoke of a barile di vino and a bottega del sangue to indicate the enormity of Christ's sacrifice... " X Mr. Wind objects to my finding a reference to the Tree of Life in the dedication of the Decachordum to Julius II (WAB, p. 45). "The most fruitful forest of doctrine" is a phrase no mediaeval or Renaissance theologian could possibly have used without remember- ing the Tree of Knowledge which became fruitful again when the apple of the Tree of Life was grafted upon it, and thus gave true doctrine to mankind. That Vigerio should elaborate such an allusion in terms of the planting, the wood and the fruit of trees strikes me as highly significant in a dedication to a Pope whose name means oak tree. But to understand fully the meaning of the phrase, one must return to the iconography of Sixtus IV. In revisiting the Sistine Chapel this year I was im- pressed by the applicability of the "forest of doctrine" to the original cycle. For the fictitious damasks which adorn the dado (on which, I regret to say, I had never previously bestowed more than a passing glance) are entirely composed of oak leaves. Moreover, each dam- ask if complete would have four rows of oak trees with seven trees in each row. Once one becomes aware of them, one has the impression that the lower por- tions of the room are swathed in a magical oak forest. I have pointed out the vertical correspondence be- tween the throne of the Rovere popes, the Burning Bush of Botticelli, Boaz whose name means "in quo robur," Jeremiah who saw a rod keeping vigil, and the Creation of Plants. The further relations between the cycle of Sixtus IV and that of Julius II are complex and must form material for separate study. But I should like to observe that the last scenes in the Life of Christ are made to correspond with the closing days of Moses, in the metaphor of the Tree of Life. For the Last Supper is of course the scene in which the fruit of the Tree of Life is offered to posterity, and the Tree itself is shown in the background, in the Crucifixion. Opposite this fresco Moses, about to die, bequeathes his rod to Aaron. Aaron's rod and the shoot from Jesse's rod which is Christ are assimilated in the Cross (HAB, p. 131, and nn. I 14 and I 15), and virga (rod) is identi- fied with virgo (virgin),"5 so that the dedication of the Chapel to the Assumption of the Virgin acts as a further bond between the two cycles. The Tree of Life seems to have been linked with the rovere tree from the very start in the Sistine Chapel.80 As for the Morgan Pontifical in which the rovere tree is juxtaposed with the cross and the rovere garlands intertwined with the sacred vine, Mr. Wind dismisses the connection as "a simple act of supplication; . . . it would follow that a donor could not present a votive offering, or participate in a symbolic act of communion without being identified with the power to which he appeals." But identification with divinity is the object of all "symbolic acts of communion," from the most primitive sacrificial meals propitiating the powers in the slaughtered animal to the host which we consume "that Christ might dwell in us and we in him," to quote the Book of Common Prayer. Surely in a religion which offers the mystical body of Christ as at once the eucha- ristic wafer and the "blessed company of all faithful people" this is the meaning of the word communion. Need one recall the countless forms and colors in which the Cross of Christ, to which all appeal as of super- natural power, is also adopted as their heraldic symbol by Christian national, religious, and family groups? A method which turns virtues into vices should have little difficulty in transforming a eulogy into an invec- tive. But this time Mr. Wind has slipped (wAB, p. 43). I translated Antonio Flaminio's lines thus: 57. While Mr. Wind may be right in saying that "nothing could be further removed from Bembo's sine labe fides than the tortuous ecstasies of St. Bonaventura" (WAB, p. 43), he cannot explain away the presence of Sixtus IV next to Bonaventura (whom he canonized) in the Disputa. 58. Measure, I, 1950, p. 414. 59. The parallel is drawn three times in the sermons of St. Peter Damian, cf. Migne, CXLIV, cols. 721, 760, and esp. 76x: "De virga Jesse devenimus ad virgam crucis, et principium redemptionis fine concludimus. Ex illa Jesus Christus virgo virga virgine mirabiliter est generatus; in ista martyr martyrum caput, et martyrii forma turpiter est appensus." At the risk of being told this instrument is "inadequate," I cannot resist noting that Migne's indices provide ten more examples of this parallel, which also appears in the Speculum humanae salva- tionis; cf. ed. Lutz and Perdrizet, Strassburg, o909, pls. 15-16. 6o. "The simple error in arithmetic that 'seven out of nine scenes in the Sistine Ceiling contain trees in one form or another,' " Mr. Wind assures us, "will not escape the observant reader" (WAB, p. 43). A more observant reader than Mr. Wind would have noticed that I called attention to the presence of trees in one form or another in seven specific scenes.</page><page sequence="12">NOTES 271 "There shall at last be no one whom the chains of sin bind; The Julian oak shall nourish the celestial sheep.""61 To Mr. Wind these words constitute an attack. I notice that my opinion is shared by Vattasso who, al- though Mr. Wind does not quote him as saying so, lists on page 19 this distich among the five eulogies in the Vatican manuscript in which Flaminio "esalto il nome S. . di Giulio II." This list includes no. xxxIv, a "doubtful compliment" according to Mr. Wind, who has overlooked the neighboring nos. xxxr, xxxv, and xxxvi, all eulogies. I am aware that nos. LIV, LVI, and xvIn are invectives, but if Mr. Wind had read Vattasso's introduction he would not have ascribed their bitterness to the notion that Flaminio was "a former ally of Cesare Borgia, Julius II's determined enemy." He would have noticed on page 16 Vattasso's theory that these attacks on the Pope's supposed vices are to be attributed to Flaminio's sympathy with Venice at a later historical stage. In fact, this humanist was so little troubled by any enmity toward, or from, Julius II that he retained his professorship at the University of Rome until his death in 15 13. Flaminio's real interests in both Cesare Borgia and Julius II were, as Vattasso pointed out, identical: he welcomed them as unifiers of Italy against the foreigner, and seems to have been the first to raise the cry of "fuori i barbari." Mr. Wind has not observed that I printed the last eight lines of Vattasso no. xxxI, in which Flaminio found Julius "more glori- ous than Caesar, his fires brighter than those of Apollo; he is the Thunderer, he holds the gate to heaven; Tartarus, the earth and the stars are in his grip" (HAB, p. 216 and n. 209). If Mr. Wind were really aware of the "political history of this particular writer," he might have read Flaminio's five page iambic exhortation to Julius to drive the barbarians from Italy, comparing him to Brutus, Horatius Cocles, Camillus, Manilius, and containing the lines with which I concluded my articles: "Ingentes anima ingentia facta sequuntur" (HAB, p. 218). In spite of Mr. Wind's efforts to demonstrate that each piece of evidence identifying the rovere tree with the Tree of Life is to be explained in another and always different way, I am persuaded that when the same phenomena perpetually recur in a series of similar instances, the same explanation ought to account for them all. Mr. Wind has left untouched the bulk of my evidence which I can scarcely repeat here. I shall continue to accept Steinmann's identification of the medallions until a better one has been offered.82 But even if Mr. Wind's as yet unannounced identifica- tion63 of the medallions at issue should prove correct, the typological evidence for the remainder can scarcely be disproved by declaring that it "need perhaps not be discussed" (WAB, p. 42). For example, I showed that the killing of Abner by Joab was a prefiguration of the betrayal of Christ by Judas. I might add that Michel- angelo's medallion is directly above Rosselli's Betrayal, in the background of the Last Supper. The medallion depicting the killing of Joram, whose body was flung into Naboth's vineyard, flanks very appropriately the planting of the vine by Noah, and is directly over the scene in which Moses passes on his rod to Aaron. I shall not repeat here the evidence already given (HAB, pp. 199-201), for such universally known parallels as that between the Sacrifice of Isaac and the Passion of Christ, the death of Absalom and the Crucifixion, the Ascen- sion of Elijah and that of Christ. That "the extremely sketchy appearance of the last medallions is not due to haste but to decay" is un- acceptable. The most cursory examination of the medal- lions ought to have convinced Mr. Wind of the truth accepted by other scholars-that the last three medal- lions were executed very hastily indeed (according to Tolnay, by pupils)."4 Julius II's exhortations for greater speed in the execution of the ceiling are common knowledge. As for the final medallion, I eagerly await the publication of the "engravings" in which the missing scene is "reproduced." The poetic identification of the medallions with the eucharist, and with the Passion whose events are pre- figured in the medallions and perpetuated in the eucha- rist, rests chiefly on the known especial devotion of Julius II to the eucharist. In view of my hypothesis that the form of the medallions reflects the relief-like character of the wafer bearing an imprint of the Cruci- fixion on one side, it is noteworthy that the Host dis- played in a monstrance in Raphael's Disputa is a splendid wafer of monumental size and sculptural char- acter, bearing on its visible side a relief of the Cruci- fixion (Fig. 4). St. Gregory (Fig. I) is the only one of the four Church Fathers who gazes at the Host directly. He bears a strong resemblance to the face of Julius II without the beard, as he appears in the Cara- dosso medal (Fig. 3), in the Raphael school drawings for the Vision of the Apocalypse which was to have been painted in the Stanza d'Eliodoro, and in those features, not masked by the beard, of the profile of Julius II in the Expulsion of Heliodorus (Fig. 2). If this majestic face, so passionately adoring the sacrament, is really that of Julius II, then, as Professor von Simson has pointed out to me, it is of great significance that in the iconography of the Mass of St. Gregory we have the nucleus of the Mass at Bolsena as represented for 61. Marco Vattasso, Antonio Flaminio e le principali poesie dell' autografo vaticano 2870, Rome, 1900, p. 51. 62. Mr. Wind for example disputes the identification of the medallion above Cumaea as "David before Nathan . . . as if David came to Nathan with a horse and attendants; actually Nathan went to David and spoke to him alone." Now there is nothing in this title to gainsay that Nathan came to David, and nothing in the Biblical account to refuse Nathan a horse to ride upon and attendants befitting his rank. As for Nathan speaking to David alone, Mr. Wind's Bible must be different from mine if it contains a single word to that effect (II Samuel xII). 63. Tolnay, (op.cit., ii, 2nd printing, p. 254) has shown the impossibility of the identification of the Death of Uriah as the Expulsion of Heliodorus. 64. cf. Tolnay's chronology, which exactly relates the visi- ble facts of the painted surface to the documentary material; OP.cit., pp. o5- 17.</page><page sequence="13">272 THE ART BULLETIN Julius II. That on the adjoining wall he had himself painted as another Pope Gregory after growing the beard may be a confirming bit of evidence. XI Mr. Wind has indicated two mistranslations from Vigerio (wAB, p. 45) in my first article. He is right and I am wrong. I quoted each passage in the original language in addition to my translation, so that the reader would never have to look beyond my pages for my evidence, nor be left in any doubt as to how I understood it. Although Mr. Wind claims this evidence is "marred by textual errors" (wAB, p. 43), he has been able to unearth just one, and that an omitted period. Nonetheless an omitted period can be serious. In this case its discovery destroys my contention that Vigerio speaks of the first Adam as rising. Mr. Wind is justified in maintaining that in the fourfold system of Biblical interpretation as expounded by Hrabanus Maurus and others what has come to be known as typology belongs more properly to the second mode, allegory, than to the fourth (WAB, p. 46). But my "misuse of the word 'anagogical' " is shared, I find, by the Catholic Dictionary and by the Oxford Dic- tionary of the English Language. In the former "Ana- gogical--(literally 'leading up')" is defined as "a name given to things typical of Christ in the Old or to the actions of Christ in the New Testament, so far as they signify the eternal glory which awaits the elect. The anagogical is a subdivision of the spiritual or mystical senses." In the latter we read that Anagoge means "I. spiritual elevation or enlightenment, esp. to under- stand mysteries, obs. 2. Mystical or spiritual interpreta- tion; an Old Testament typification of something in the New." The modern meaning of the word should not be applied as in my articles to the fourfold interpre- tation; it is perfectly appropriate to typology. I must do penance for one unsupported guess. With no textual authority I assumed that Jonah's gourd vine typified the Cross. While rightly castigating me for this, Mr. Wind no more noticed than had I that in the Vulgate Jonah has no gourd vine. His plant is an ivy. This classical material for the triumphal crown of victors"5 is well placed at the head of the Sistine Chapel, the culmination of the entire program. The ancient use of the plant was well known in the Middle Ages,"6 but perhaps the most appropriate meaning for the Sistine Chapel is that given by Hrabanus for the ivy of Jonah: "the Hebrew people which declined through infidelity, which once flourished in the patriarchs and the proph- ets."'7 We see the ivy (likened to the rovere tree and supplied with acorns) flourishing in the last of the prophets of the program, he who typifies the Resurrec- tion of Christ, he who catches fish miraculously as an earlier Peter, he who alone speaks directly to God. XII The metaphor chosen by Mr. Wind to express his dissatisfaction with my acknowledgments toward him is regrettable. I took some pains in this regard, on p. S16, notes I and 4; p. I35, note 135; p. 182, note 12; page 188, note 58; p. 203. The following remarks caused strong comment: "No scholar can treat the iconography of the Sistine Ceiling without great in- debtedness to the lectures of Professor Edgar Wind, which have called attention to problems hitherto largely unsuspected, even when as in the present instance the suggested solutions of those problems differ radically from those proposed by Dr. Wind." It is now stated that I "have refrained from specifying what these hitherto unsuspected problems were," and that Mr. Wind's "aim in these lectures was to prove that the many deviations from the literal text of the Bible, which have been so often observed in the Sistine Ceiling, are due to the prophetic nature of the program, in which all the scenes from the Old Testament have been designed as adumbrations or 'types' of the New. This principle," Mr. Wind declares (wAB, p. 42), I have "adopted," while "omitting the whole problem from the general footnote and listing instances in two widely separated notes." I shall be glad to state that Mr. Wind suggested in his lectures a far-reaching typological program for the Sistine Ceiling, purporting to explain some aspects of the order on prophetic grounds. It is perhaps inevitable that, when a scholar lectures for many years on a subject he does not publish, others who must from time to time refer to his contributions lay themselves open to charges of anticipating his publications if they summarize his the- ories, or of unauthorized borrowing if they do not. I am obliged also to state that Mr. Wind's conception of the reverse order in which the scenes must be read to bring out their hidden meaning, as well as the notion of a prophetic connection between the prophets and the scenes, had already been discovered by Tolnay."8 The typological significance of Noah in the Sistine was pointed out by Klaczko in 1902, citing both the Specu- lum and the Biblia Pauperum. This was the first insight into the (forgive me) anagogical content of the Sistine Ceiling. On it depended the analysis of the first three scenes, and consequently of the entire program. I cannot therefore recognize the application of typol- ogy to the Sistine Ceiling as an independent contribu- tion by Mr. Wind, and in fact I am not even aware of his thesis in regard to the first three scenes of Creation. I chose to acknowledge, rather, my indebtedness to the 65. Ovid, Fasti, III, 37, to quote one among the innumerable examples. 66. Hrabanus Maurus, De Universo, Migne, cxI, col. 528, and St. Isidore, Etymologiarum libri XX, Migne, LxxxII, col. 626, both quote the lines from Virgil: "Inter victrices hederam tibi serpere lauros." 67. Hrabanus, loc.cit., "Unde in libro Jonae Prophetae hedera sub cujus umbraculo Jonas sededat. . . . Judaica plebs per infidelitatem exaruit, quae quondam florebat in patriarchis et prophetis." 68. Mr. Wind offers three Biblical quotations as "the only points on which Tolnay agrees with" his interpretation.</page><page sequence="14">NOTES 273 scholar to whom the credit rightly belongs. Nonethe- less, I went to some pains to obtain the notes of others on Mr. Wind's lectures, in order to compare them with my own and avoid any inadvertent use of his conclusions. I found that the sole original contribution of Mr. Wind which I could not avoid utilizing and still develop my own ideas on the Sistine was his interpretation of the Creation of Eve. I gave him credit thus: "Wind was the first scholar to interpret the Creation of Eve on the Sistine Ceiling in the light of the above tradition. I am indebted to his public lectures for this crucial point." In other cases I found it possible to state my own conclu- sions in such a way as not to anticipate Mr. Wind's theories whether I agreed or disagreed with them.
