<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tennyson and the Metaphysics of Material Culture: The Early Poetry ALLISON ADLER KROLL culture, the institutionalization of material forms of cultural memory, emerged in England over the course of the nineteenth century in conjunction with a new set of languages about the relationship between human communities and the physical worlds they create and inhabit. The development of modern geology, archaeology, and anthropology from the 1830s onward made it possible to think about artifacts, landscapes, and even the everyday things of the present as participants in human history and thus expressive of that history,1 Preserving the physical remains of the past became a major concern in the later decades of the century as a number of institutions were established to collect and maintain the artifacts and scenes of the English past. Yet, organizations such as the Society to Preserve Ancient Buildings (1882) and the National Trust (1895) were long in coming, only forming after several decades of debate about the status of England's material culture. Tennyson is one of the earliest nineteenth-century writers to articu- late the need for a change in the way his contemporaries thought about and exercised concern for the objects and landscapes of English culture. Though he himself remained ambivalent about the material world past and present, his poetry nevertheless adumbrated the central cultural tensions and anxiet- ies that English heritage institutions ultimately came to assuage. The "Morte d' Arthur" (1833-34), for example, debates whether we must maintain physi- cal contact with the past- to preserve its material traces, in other words-or whether the imaginative realms of poetry, myth, and legend provide a more effective means of conserving cultural memory. The tension that Tennyson registers in this early poem between a desire to define history by its records, and an opposing impulse to record history in the more ethereal expanses of poetry and myth, governs all of his subsequent efforts to imagine personal and national histories. The "Morte" stages a battle of wills, at the end of Arthur's own last battle, between the great mythic king and his loyal knight Sir Bedivere over the preservation of Arthur's memory. The latter takes the mortally wounded king to "a chapel nigh the field" of battle, "a ruined shrine" which has a 461</page><page sequence="2">462 / VICTORIAN POETRY "broken chancel with a broken cross."2 At Arthur's request, Bedivere leaves his dying sovereign in "the place of tombs, / Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, / Old knights" (11. 46-48), so that he can cast the great brand, Excalibur, away. Bedivere, though, fails twice to dispatch Excalibur as his dying king wishes, agonizing over the consequences that the loss of Arthur's renowned sword would entail. In his second venture to the verge of the lake where he must throw Excalibur, Bedivere pauses and wonders: What record, or what relic of my lord Should be to aftertime, but empty breath And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, Some one might show it at a joust of arms, Saying, "King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake. Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps Upon the hidden bases of the hills." So might some old man speak in the aftertime To all the people, winning reverence. (11. 98-108) Bedivere's desire to retain Excalibur as a "relic" of his king would seem to derive from a motive similar to the age-old custom of preserving saints' relics, that is, from a desire to retain some physical contact with an object that has been intimately connected to a figure, now lost, of great cultural or spiritual significance. It is the public nature of the display that Bedivere imagines here, however, which makes his attachment to this object so different from that older conservative impulse. Like so many of the objects in The Idylls of the King where this poem would ultimately come to reside, Excalibur, by Bedivere's reckoning, should not be discarded, but instead "stored in some treasure-house" (1. 101) for public consumption. Nor should the famous brand be left to molder with the bones of the "mighty kings" (1. 101) in the older version of just such a reliquary, that is, the church where Arthur himself lies dying; rather, it should be on "show ... at a joust of arms" (1. 102), and a museum-like tag about its fashioning by the lady of the lake included with that display. In this fleeting moment- for Bedivere finally does submit to Arthur's command to return the sword to its maker- Tennyson has anticipated the ideology of heritage. Bedivere's exhortation to store the relics of the past so that the past itself does not become "empty breath" (1. 99)- "rumours" (1. 100) and tales all but devoid of vitality- is a call to conserve the physical presence of the past for the future. Moreover, Bedivere imagines that the conservation and later display of Excalibur will unite "all the people" in "reverence" as the narrative of this artifact's historical significance and production is told. Excalibur as artifact has the power not only to keep the Arthurian past embodied and thus</page><page sequence="3">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 463 alive- literally inspired, but it also offers a kind of aura or vitality that can unify its viewers in reverential awe. In the early 1830s, when Tennyson wrote the "Morte d' Arthur," the cultural and religious consensus that Bedivere hopes his king's sword will produce seemed only possible in some mythical aftertime. And yet, English heritage institutions from the nineteenth century to the present day come to use precisely this model of a vitalized or even spiritual- ized material past as a means of creating cultural consensus, which in turn is responsible for producing and reproducing English national identity. If Tennyson anticipates heritage culture in Bedivere' s internal mono- logue, it is partly because in the larger narrative of poem, he also expresses the cultural and spiritual anxieties that render it necessary, or at least desirable. The differences between Tennyson's poem and his source material palpably reveal an overdetermined, nineteenth-century disquietude with Malory's narrative of spiritual struggle and cultural decline. To cite a few examples, Malory's "little chapel"3 becomes in Tennyson a "ruined shrine," Bedivere's initial disloyalty a conflicted desire to retain "the precious hilt" and to conserve a cultural artifact, and that faithful knight's weeping and wailing over his dead king an overwhelming desolation at the loss of the "true old times" which must now yield "place to new" (11. 229, 240). In each of these instances, Tennyson's changes to his source register the central concerns of both his own poetic project and the era which he, by virtue of his sensitivity to these issues, came imaginatively to dominate: a church in ruin, a society "dissolved," its artifacts dispersed, and its men left "companionless . . . Among new men, strange faces, other minds" (11. 234, 236, 238). All of these aspects of Tennyson's poem are symbolic of the poet's own struggles with spiritual doubt, discontinuity, and loss in the months after Hallam's death, the event which of course lies behind the poem; but these moments of spiritual and social disarray are also emblematic of English culture at large in the years just before and following that catastrophe in the future poet laureate's personal experience. Of all of the images through which Tennyson expresses his sense of distress in the "Morte d' Arthur," the ruined shrine is perhaps the most sig- nificant in terms of its being symbolic not only of the poet's own personal struggle with faith, but also of a more general crisis in the English church. As Owen Chadwick explains in his classic study of the Victorian church, the late 1820s and early 1830s saw the English church in danger.4 As a state institution and symbol of English identity, the church was threatened by the necessity of Catholic Emancipation in 1829 and further called into question by the bishops' infamous opposition to the 1832 Reform Bill. In her seminal Britons: Forging the Nation, 1707-1837 ', Linda Colley remarks that England, as a nation identified by its Protestant church and state, could not persist once the 1801 union with Ireland essentially forced the Catholic emancipation issue, although resolution would not come until the late 1820s.5 The fact that only</page><page sequence="4">464 / VICTORIAN POETRY a few years after this, twenty-one Anglican bishops voted against the Reform Bill and caused its defeat in the House of Lords did not improve the church's status as an institution which claimed to express national consensus. The anti- institutionalism that subsequently came to dominate the national spirit often translated into direct assaults on the validity of the established church.6 As W. J. Fox of the Monthly Repository declaimed in January 1832, "Our forms, laws, establishments ... are become so inefficient . . . that they must evidently undergo extensive changes." He singles out the church in particular, insisting that "the Church cannot remain as it is; its temples have long ceased to be national."7 The church's difficulties in the years just prior to Victoria's reign have been well-documented and much discussed, but less than sufficient notice has been taken of the fact that at the same moment, and very much in response to the church's inability to respond satisfactorily to the needs of its people, heritage institutions were beginning to take form. Such institutional permutations constitute just half of the story. While Tennyson began his poetic career at the same time that the church was pal- pably losing its institutional authority, his earliest poetry suggests that he, like many of his fellow Englishmen, also believed that as a site of spiritual puissance, it had already become "an ancient form / Through which the spirit breathes no more" (In Memoriam, 105.19-20). Partly as a result of a series of Romantic responses to larger philosophical questions, religious ex- perience became detached from its institutional moorings by the end of the eighteenth century, leaving in the wake of that separation a national church which lacked the anchor of a national faith. It has become a truism to speak of the Victorian crisis of faith, but as A. S. Byatt remarks in On Histories and Stories, the catastrophic moment that "crisis" suggests hardly accords with the ways in which Victorian spiritual uncertainty grew gradually, and insidi- ously, taking a host of forms.8 The most important formal shift for the later emergence of heritage institutions came quite early in this progressive model, when it became apparent that the Romantic idea of immanence, imagined by Wordsworth as a partial replacement for a no longer tenable notion of transcendence, had in fact not only not closed the gap between subject and object, but had shifted spiritual experience away from the institutional safety of conventional Christian worship to far more diffuse sites such as the setting of suns, the sounding cataract, and the meanest flower that blows. By divest- ing the church of its spiritual aura, immanence, as a model for bridging the spiritual and the worldly, contributed to an already growing sense that the English church could not address the spiritual needs of its parishioners. In turn, the church's loss of its spiritual dominion compromised its ability to symbolize, if not actually to produce, national and cultural consensus. And thus one Romantic problem, namely, how to reconceive the connection between the spiritual and the material when the possibility of transcendence</page><page sequence="5">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 465 had evaporated (post Kant), became, for the Victorians, three. The church, once conservator of English spiritual, national, and cultural identities, having failed to maintain its hold upon the first, slowly began to lose its capacity to define the other two. The institutional stresses of the late 1820s and 1830s drastically hastened the process, and by the early 1830s, both Hallam and Tennyson had consequently begun to concern themselves with the problem of finding forms for the national, cultural, and religious spirits left to float freely since the English church could no longer contain them. Hallam had high hopes for a "marriage of religion with literature" which might "gather once again the scattered rays of human knowledge" and counterbalance the "propulsion toward change" everywhere apparent in nineteenth-century Britain.9 Such a marriage was not, in his conception of it, merely spiritually or culturally significant, but also nationally so. "In the old times," he claims in his 1831 review of Tennyson's Poems, Chiefly Lyrical, "the poetic impulse went along with the general impulse of the nation; in these it is a reaction against it, a check acting for conservation" in times of change.10 Even if the "general impulse of the nation" is one at odds with the conservative effects of poetry in Hallam's estimation, an implicit claim for a relationship between poetry and nation still obtains, in that poetry reacts against change to conserve the nation's spirit or impulse even as the latter seems to go astray. Poetry imbued with religion promises to provide an even stronger force of cultural conservation. In an essay on "The Influence of Ital- ian on English literature" (1831), Hallam "look[s] to the lurid presages of the times," that is, the social unease preceding the first Reform Bill, and warns of the "awful commotions of society" to come, which may cause "disruption ... of those common bands which hold together our social existence, neces- sarily followed by an occurrence on a larger scale of the same things that were witnessed in France forty years ago" ("Influence of Italian," p. 233). Only a "true spiritual Christianity" can provide the "support" required "in such a desolation," but in these "times of unchristian ascendancy," it is "useful" to "fix our thoughts habitually on that first development of modern literature," when "follow[ing] the subversion of Rome, the muses clung not in vain for safety to the inviolate altars of the Catholic church" (p. 233). In so doing, Hallam suggests, we might recapture some of that salutary "influence of our religion on our conditions of society," albeit through a "purer spirit than . . . Roman Catholicism" (p. 234). The "English mind that has drunk deep at the sources of Southern inspiration" can "absor[b] . . . the pure inner light" of that earlier union of the poetic and religious, and convey in English poetry an inspirational "quiet beauty" to troubled times (p. 234). While Hallam concedes that his "own anticipations seldom incline to so favourable" a circumstance as a renewed bond between poetry and institutional religion, he hopes here that a poetic recollection of such an alliance will produce similar cultural,</page><page sequence="6">466 / VICTORIAN POETRY social, and spiritual effects (p. 234). Hallam, of course, was not alone in hoping for a spiritual solution to the nation's perilous instability in the 1830s. Just a few months after Hallam delivered his essay on the influence of Italian on English literature at Cam- bridge, Coleridge, in Table Talk, reiterated his claim from On the Constitution of Church and State that "the church is the last relic of our nationality," and urged Parliament to consider measures which would preserve that failing institution.11 Literarily, the Church had in fact become a relic by the 1830s owing to no one other than Wordsworth, himself of course Coleridge's closest poetic compatriot, and coincidentally the poet most responsible for articulating the notion of immanence.12 Wordsworth, in response to the insti- tutional limitations of the English church in terms of its capacity to respond to the post-Enlightenment spiritual crisis that the Romantics faced, came to "invest the material Universe" itself with spirituality.13 If, as it seemed clear to Wordsworth by the end of the eighteenth century, transcendence was no longer philosophically possible, perhaps certain kinds of contact with the natural world could at least suggest the nature of the spiritual world beyond it. A truly reflective soul might apprehend in some natural scene "something far more deeply interfused,"14 suggestive of a union between the earthly and the transcendent. As even the most cursory reading of a poem like "Tintern Abbey" reveals,15 the poet's conception of immanence re-maps the church's spiritual force onto the landscape. In his earliest poetry, though, Tennyson already has begun to question Wordsworth's relocation of spirituality to the material world. The way that he does so, furthermore, reveals an imagination primed for the kind of cultural work that his poetry was to perform. A "formal agnostic," as A. Dwight Culler aptly describes him,16 Tennyson recognizes the precise nature of the Romantic problem he has inherited; that is, all previous forms of religious experience are now tainted by the irrevocable dissociation of the heavenly and the earthly, the transcendent and the human. New forms of spirituality are necessary, not only for the metaphysical well-being of men, but also for the foundation of cultural institutions to replace the church that doubt has all but destroyed. Unlike Wordsworth, Tennyson has no faith- with good reason- in the no- tion that, failing direct contact with the heavenly, men still have access to the spiritual within the earthly. And unlike Hallam or Coleridge, who still seem to hope for or at least desire institutional religious solutions to the spiritual and cultural difficulties that the church's waning authority has produced, Tennyson brings to his preliminary attempts to reformulate spirituality and cultural continuity his oft-cited "passion for the past,"17 which leads him to turn to myth, to historic and legendary landscapes, and to geological and astronomical prehistory for the answers he seeks. And while he often invokes the same religious framework that Hallam does, he does so only to deny its</page><page sequence="7">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 467 efficacy. In fact, in his most radical early poems, Tennyson's spiritual imagery casts a pallor over conventional forms of religious experience that one does not find again until Swinburne. "Timbuctoo" (1829), for example, a reworking of the earlier "Armaged- don" (composed in 1824), opens as the speaker stands upon a mountain-top, looking out upon "The silent Heavens . . . blenched with faery light, / Uncertain whether faery light or cloud" and "the stars . . ♦ flooded over with clear glory and pale" (1.5-6, 8-9). These lines resonate with the closing lines of "Armageddon" where "An icy veil / Of pale, weak, lifeless, thin unnatural blue / Wrap[s] up the rich varieties of things / In grim and grisly sameness" and the "clear stars / Sh[i]ne out with keen but fixed intensity, / All-silence." As in "Timbuctoo," a heavenly silence prevails, but in the earlier poem, that silence appears more troubled; "An indefinable pulsation / Inaudible . . . but felt" seems to emanate from the Heavens, here termed the "soul of the Universe," a sphere "Heav[ingJ with tumultuous throbbings on the vast / Suspense of some grand issue," presumably the apocalypse (IV.21-24, 29-30, 32-34). Taken together, these two passages envision an ethereal, eerily faint heavenly sphere that threatens to overawe the speaker of each poem with uncertainty. In "Armageddon," the speaker awaits the fulfillment of the pres- ages of apocalypse he has just witnessed through the aid of a visiting seraph. Even given his privileged view, however, the speaker ends in doubt. His flash of union with "the Unchangeable," or the "Eternal Mind," passes, and the clarity of vision it produces wanes into a gloomy "sameness," a reinstatement of what the seraph terms "dull Mortality," which "clog[s]" the senses and "fetter[s]" the "spirit" (11.46-47, 11.1445). Despite having experienced such oneness with the eternal mind that he "could have fallen down / Before [his] own strong soul and worshipped it" (1.49-50), the speaker finally cannot see through the veil of mortality, nor feel anything more than an elemental sug- gestion of the apocalypse to come.18 "Timbuctoo" begins, in more ways than one, where "Armageddon" leaves off. Unable to penetrate the mystical sphere of heaven, "Armageddon" s speaker fears that even his poetry cannot redeem his lost vision, for that which he has seen remains "inexpressible by loftiest rhyme" (1. 23). "Timbuc- too" opens with a bardic recollection of "legends quaint and old / Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth" (11. 16-17), the speaker, as in West's painting of Gray's The Bard, perched fatefully atop a great precipice. But all of these legends, like those of Atlantis, and Eldorado, or even Timbuctoo, have "their being in the heart of men," and, according to the seraph who appears in this poem as well, can only shadow "forth the Unattainable," the "glory' of Heaven" (11. 19, 193, 196). The poem thus seems to open by grant- ing "Armageddon" s claim that "to paint / In dignity of language suitable / The majesty" of the heavenly sphere "were past the power of man" (11. 17-18,</page><page sequence="8">468 / VICTORIAN POETRY 20). That is, no humanly apprehensible narrative or rhetoric can offer direct access to the transcendent. Nor is any immanent sense of the heavenly, barely hinted at in the closing "throbbings" of "Armageddon" (IV.33), possible here. The silent stars at the end of "Armageddon" have in "Timbuctoo" become "silent Heavens," suggesting a further dissociation between the heavenly and the earthly. Moreover, the heavenly is not even certainly heavenly, but perhaps of the world of faery, that realm of myth which the poet almost immediately thereafter equates to such places as the fantastic Atlantis. Indeed the tendency of all human mythmaking to collapse into "dreams . . . of passing loveliness" becomes clear when Tennyson draws an analogy between the "yearning Hope" with which men cling to legends and myths to a "pale Priestess" who, while the "City . . . walls / Shake" with what seems to be an earthquake, and even the temple lamp "dips and winks," "kneels ... in deep faith" before a pagan god whose "eyes wear no light but that wherewith her phantasy informs them" (11. 77-78, 27, 34, 28-29, 35, 34, 38-39). It is almost too clear that the pale priestess' faith, literally shaken, figures forth the parlous condition of English faith, despite Tennyson's having located the priestess herself in the classical "lone Acropolis" (1. 32). The quaking city walls about her signal the vulnerability of the ancient faith for which she kneels, while the "phantasy" with which she "informs" the very form (i.e., the pagan god) of her worship with its spiritual significance unmistakably allegorizes the formal religious dilemma that Tennyson subtly elucidates throughout the poem. In other words, "Timbuctoo" turns out to be a lengthy meditation on the nature of human mythmaking and on the relationship of such mythmaking to traditional forms of religious experience. The speaker, musing over ancient myths, is granted a "true" vision of heaven and earth by the seraph who frees him briefly from his "dull Mortality." That vision, however, comes to us as a great clarification of the material world, rather than as the union with the eternal mind in "Armageddon," and as such constitutes a less mystical experience than in the earlier poem. The speaker's "failing sense[s]" may apprehend "The smallest grain that dapple[s] the dark Earth" and the "indistinctest atom in deep air," but in his "vanity" only does he seem "to stand / Upon the outward verge and bound alone / Of full beati- tude" (11. 94, 97, 98, 92, 92-94). The language here almost wholly revokes the transcendent experience of "Armageddon," for the speaker of "Timbuctoo" questions the validity of the "supernatural excitation" (1. 89) the seraph fo- ments in him, never for a moment alleging that oneness with God that his poetic predecessor does. He only seems to reach the very outer boundaries of "beatitude," now no longer even a personally identifiable "Mind," as in "Armageddon." The later speaker's diminished spiritual encounter becomes even more circumscribed as he learns from the seraph that he orchestrates such events in order "to sway / The heart of man," guiding him "nigher"- but</page><page sequence="9">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 469 not to-"the spheres of Heaven" (11. 191492, 212). The seraph allows the speaker, pace Wordsworth, to see into the nature of things, and when he informs his charge that he also "play[s] about" man's "heart a thousand ways," and "visits his eyes with visions and his ears / With harmonies of wind and wave and wood" (11. 201-203), we expect an argument for immanence to follow (though perhaps we ought to be suspicious of the Puck-like nature of this supposed heavenly creature). However, immanence is not what the angel has to offer. Rather, he is "the Spirit, / The permeating life which courseth through / All the intricate and labyrinthine veins / Of the great vine of Fable" (11. 215-218). Even at the sentence level, Tennyson invokes the possibility of an immanent spirituality- we surely must expect the angel to be the "permeating life which courseth through" the winds and woods and waves through which he also claims to create harmonies to win men to him. Fable, though, is what we finally get. Now, if we were to ignore the poem's opening lines, the seraph's fabular nature would not present the problem that it in fact does. For, have we not been told from the beginning of the poem onward that fable merely covers over shaken faith, that it appeals to "spirit[s] fettered with the bond of clay" (1. 82), incapable of seeing anything more than old "dreams ... of passing loveliness?" (11. 77-78). And further, have we not learned that men's fables have "their being in the heart of Man" (1. 19), in fact "As air is the life of flame?" (1. 20). In which case, the seraph too becomes a product of human imagination, and as such, of course cannot offer this speaker the heavenly contact that his counterpart in the earlier version of the poem enjoys. Thus far then, Tennyson manages only to delineate the most distressing consequences of the post-Romantic dissociation of heaven and earth: that bound by earthly vision, even our imagination of what the heavenly might be is clouded, faint, and even obscuring, while that bounded- ness itself compels us to generate comforting myths which have their origin not in supernatural events, but in our own constrained imaginations. Nor can the emerging narratives of science provide any more access to the supernatural. Despite the desire of Tennyson's tutor at Trinity, William Whewell, to affirm the truth of natural theology (another name, one could argue, for immanence) in his contribution to the Bridgewater Treatises,19 no such connection between the natural and supernatural worlds exists, at least not in Tennyson's estimation. While the 1830 Poems mark the beginnings of Tennyson's lifelong poetic engagement with the relationship between those two worlds, as Milton Millhauser notes, that engagement produces Ten- nyson's darkest poetry.20 Far from finding evidence of God in a scientifically explicable universe, Tennyson seems only to discover increasingly disturbing proofs of our implication in the material and of the limitations of our this- worldly consciousness. The companion poems "Nothing Will Die" and "All Things Will Die" rehearse apparently conflicting claims about the creation</page><page sequence="10">470 / VICTORIAN POETRY of the material universe. Both poems test the metaphysical implications of the creation narratives they articulate, but together, they offer nothing more than a juxtaposition of equally distressing postulates and yet another denial of the possibility of immanence. Although Isobel Armstrong argues quite persuasively that in these two poems Tennyson "turns ontological statements . . . into conflicting myths" to show how "laws . . . appear to be constructed by the human mind, whether they are Christian or geological" (p. 56), I would contend that another kind of dynamic is at work. In "Nothing Will Die," a geologically conceived world of change affords the possibility that "the world was never made," and that thus, it "will change, but it will not fade" (11. 30-31). In "All Things Will Die," the rather glib as- sertion that "the old earth / Had a birth" leads the speaker to conclude that "the old earth must die," along with "all things [that] were born" (11. 37-38, 41, 47). The trouble with assuming that, through these two poems, Tennyson means to set a geological view of the material world in opposition to a Chris- tian one is that the two statements "the world was never made" and "the old earth had a birth" do not actually accord with such a dichotomy. Of course to claim that the world was never made is to call into question the Biblical account of creation, but the statement that the earth was born could apply equally well to a Christian or a geological narrative of the earth's genesis. It seems to me that the crux of these two poems lies not in the possible conflict between science and religion, but, as in so much of Tennyson's later poetry, the possibility that both ways of thinking produce equally alienating material worlds. In both poems, geological and Christian ideas jumble together, derang- ing our sense of their distinctness. "Nothing Will Die," although it revolves around a geological hypothesis, nevertheless belies its scientific framework with images of resurrection as spring produces "life anew" (1. 29). In "All Things Will Die," the earth's historicity, occasioned by its birth, means that "ye will come never more" (1. 48). Read from a Christian point of view, "All Things" appears to grant the creation myth of Genesis only to deny the redemption of the teleological history it inaugurates. If we "will come never more," nor see "even and morn . . . Through eternity" (11. 4446), it would seem that we are precluded from any recognizable version of the redemption that a Christian history of the world would promise. A geological reading of the poem educes a similarly dreary conclusion; if we can fix the birth of the world itself scientifically speaking, then surely we can envision its death. As all things born are surrounded by images of death in the poem itself- "Ice with warm blood mixing," "The red cheek paling" (11. 33, 31)- so geological time threatens to engulf all of the material universe in the spiral of nativity and mortality of which it is comprised. But finally, both poems betray their author's anxieties about both of the kinds of creation narratives he has presented in them. "Nothing Will Die"</page><page sequence="11">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 471 opens with an anthropomorphic meditation on the natural world. The speaker asks, "When will the stream be aweary of flowing / Under my eye? / When will the wind be aweary of blowing/ Over the sky?" (11. 14). Unable to imagine what the closing lines of the poem promise, that "even and morn / Ever will be / Through eternity," the speaker attributes a human weariness to a nature that we learn will never die. The human voice which opens "Nothing" is in fact rather quickly forgotten as change in the natural world governs the rest of the poem. Though a "spring rich and strange, / Shall make the winds blow . . . Till the air / And the ground / Shall be filled with life anew" (11. 21-29), no human life figures into that cycle of change. In the end, only "even and morn" remain for eternity, hardly a consoling conclusion: the heavenly has been replaced by what is simply and literally the heavens. Nature here does not seem to have any need of the human, whose consciousness it supersedes as the poem commences, nor for a God- its own spring creates its own winds to blow the seeds of change and renewal, and it needs only the rotation of the earth from eve to morn to sustain itself through eternity. So much for Wordsworth's immanent material universe. Disappointed by the language of science as a source of reformulating either the heavenly or the human, Tennyson turns to that very human realm, memory, in the 1830 Poems as a possible source of spiritual succor. Here again, predictably, he finds further evidence of our forlorn state, but he also explores some important aspects of personal memory that recur when he turns to cul- tural memory in his later work. The nature of our relationship to the past is of course at stake in all of Tennyson's writing about memory. As he is often quoted as saying, Tennyson had a "passion for the past" which verged on mor- bid obsession. While such a relationship to the past made Tennyson uniquely qualified to speak for a nation increasingly defined by its past from the 1830s onward, for the poet himself, it was more often than not a discomforting one. As Tennyson's Cambridge colleague James Spedding remarked, the poet was "a man always discontented with the Present till it has become the Past, and then he yearns toward it, and worships it, and not only worships it, but is dis- contented because it is past" (Martin, p. 203). Tennyson himself described his obsession somewhat more charitably, but admitted that "it is the distance that charms me in the landscape, the picture and the past, and not the immediate to-day in which I move" (Ricks, 2:232n). In both statements, the poet seems to suffer from a characterological restlessness with the very categories of past and present, an uneasiness which certainly informs his poetry on memory, and qualifies even his most passionate effusions about the past. Three of Tennyson's poems from the late 1820s focus specifically on the pleasures and pains of memory. "Ode to Memory," an earlier poem not published until 1830, characterizes memory as a cultivator of spiritual hope. The two other early poems on that theme, "Memory [Memory! dear</page><page sequence="12">472 / VICTORIAN POETRY enchanter]" (1827) and "Memory [Ay me!]" (ca. 1830), lament the way that memory recalls dashed hopes to us and reminds us of our failings, and even of our fallenness. All three, however, treat memory with some degree of ambiva- lence. In "Memory! dear enchanter," memory appears as a kind of conjurer, the "enchanter" of the first line. Materializing the "years gone by" and their "Hopes which now are parted," memory reminds the speaker that he is "lorn and lonely" in a world of dreams "dead" and all but forgotten (11. 6, 21, 62, 63). Like the serpent wrapped round the tree of knowledge in Eden, memory "cling[s]" to the tree of human experience "sour[ing]" its fruits "to our taste" (11. 31, 32). Tennyson's calculated link between memory and the moment of human fallenness recurs in "Memory [Ay me!]," only there the human spirit is the serpent, crushing the tree of knowledge in anticipation of its prey, that is, memory. In both poems, memory recalls its own genesis- that original fall from what Tennyson calls, in "Memory! dear enchanter," "conscious in- nocence" (1. 60)- and thus permeates and corrupts or "sours" all aspects of material existence. On the other hand, in each of these two poems, memory also appears as not just an enchanter, but as a "dear enchanter" (1. 1) and a "Blessed . . . Spirit" ("Memory [Ay me!]," 11. 5-6) capable of proffering "vi- sions blest" ("Memory! dear enchanter," 1. 44). Memory appears under all of these apparently beneficent guises, however, only to deceive. The speaker in "Memory [Ay me!]" asks, "Wherefore do I so remember / That Hope is Born of Memory / Nightly in the house of dreams?" (11. 21-23). Remembrance of the memory of hope, however, is clearly all that this allegorical Memory can provide, and when the speaker wakes, she has turned into "the faery change- ling wan Despair," a grotesque figure, "dark of bright" and "foul of fair," a "frightful child with shrivelled cheeks" (11. 25, 27, 28). The temporal and sensory-distorting effects that memory produces become nightmarish here, threatening to unhinge the speaker entirely as he imagines being taunted by a changeling figure "Who laughs all day and never speaks," a ghost "wandering" from "the body of the Past," "life without life or breath, / Death forth issuing from Death" (11. 26, 14, 13, 17-18). Uncannily free of its own body, the past, memory paradoxically becomes here utterly material; it is life without breath, or in Tennysonian idiom, life without spirit- the purely material- and so that most material of states, death itself. "Ode to Memory," on the other hand, commences by banishing mem- ory's darker side, though in so doing, calls attention to that side nonetheless. The speaker, dejected, attempts to conjure memory out of the morning mist. "Come," he calls to her- for she is once again a feminine figure- "not as thou earnest of late, / Flinging the gloom of yesternight, / On the white day; but robed in softened light" (11. 8-10). Rather than being the harbinger of obscu- rity and darkness as in the other poems on memory, this figure "steal[s] fire / From the fountains of the past, / To glorify the present," a present in which</page><page sequence="13">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 473 the speaker himself "faint[s]" in "obscurity" (11. 1-3, 6). As in "Memory [Ay me!]," memory is called upon to bear her "infant Hope" within the world of dreams (1. 30). Now, though, night is not her "shroud" (1. 28), and the dreams in which she appears do not transform into terrifying nightmares, but produce rest "softer than unbroken rest" (1. 29). Then, just as the spirit of fable does in "Timbuctoo", she leads the speaker "nigher to heaven's spheres," with "lordly music flowing from / The illimitable years" (11. 40, 41*42). In other words, memory in this poem draws us toward our higher, not our fallen selves. Just why this version of memory differs so from those in the other two poems on that subject emerges in the fourth section of the poem. There we find that "Divinest Memory" hails not in some Wordsworthian fashion from a sublime "waterfall / Which ever sounds and shines / A pillar of white light upon the wall / Of purple cliffs, aloof' (11. 51-54)- Instead, the speaker summons her forth from a landscape less "aloof," and not in the least sublime. She is to come from "the woods that belt the gray hill-side . . . the ridged wolds" of Tennyson's own Somersby (11. 55, 67), an identification the poet himself makes in the Eversley edition notes to this section of the poem (Ricks, 2:233). And in this moment, Tennyson lights upon the consolatory device to which he will return again and again, in In Memoriam, The Idylls of the King, and elsewhere, namely, the making "holy" that which is merely human, in a sort of reverse kenosis, the spiritualization of that which is common, local, quotidian.21 And so the countryside of his childhood becomes the divine spring of an unfallen memory, one that partakes in and stems from the "conscious innocence" of childhood. In the last section of the poem, the poet further implicates himself in the process of divine memory-making when he characterizes the figure Memory as a "great artist" much taken with the "first-born of [her] genius," the "prime labour of [her] early days" (11. 80, 92, 94). In the "gallery" of her original "sketch[es]" (11. 84, 95), she includes a series of scenes from Tennyson's childhood, of the family cottage at Mablethorpe, the Lincolnshire seaside, and the Somersby rectory, once again identifying this "great artist" with the great poet. The poem ends with a paean apparently to memory, but actually to Hallam. It was Hallam who recognized Tennyson's profound connection to his native countryside, the "spot where [his] mind was moulded in silent sym- pathy with the everlasting forms of nature."22 In contrast to Wordsworth, also a poet in sympathy with eternal forms of nature, Tennyson carefully localizes his childhood landscapes, and deliberately inscribes them with community. Rather than seeking out "houseless woods," as the speaker of "Tintern Ab- bey" does, the artist Memory commemorates scenes which combine the hu- man and natural worlds- "seven elms, the poplars four . . . beside my father's door," "a lowly cottage" in view of sea, "a garden bowered close / With plaited alleys of the trailing rose" (11. 56-57, 100, 105-106). In place of the "vagrant</page><page sequence="14">474 / VICTORIAN POETRY dwellers" of "Tintern Abbey" we find in Tennyson's poem several abodes all clearly showing in their attendant gardens, bowers, grottoes, and plots, signs of habitation and care. To these spots, like the traveller to his spot above the Wye in Wordsworth's poem, "We" may "retir[e]" (11. 115, 111), but the first person plural immediately makes Tennyson's sites of memory more inclusive, less isolated, and finally more consoling. The lowly cottage and the peacefully inhabited English countryside return to counter the soul's self-isolation in "The Palace of Art" (1832). If Tennyson recognizes early in his career that we cannot live in nature, his friend R. C. Trench reminds him in 1831 that "we cannot live in Art" either (Ricks, 1:436), prompting the former to pen his allegorical narrative of the soul who dares to sever "Beauty, Good, and Knowledge," the "three sisters" who, according to the prefatory verses attached to The Palace, "never can be parted without tears" (11. 10, 13). As we read "The Palace of Art," we find that what the poet really means in his rather aphoristic preface is that any attempt to withdraw into abstract categories such as the aesthetic, the philo- sophical, or even the spiritual will end in despair.23 Although Hallam argues in his review of Tennyson's 1830 Poems that poetry ought not to be "mixed up with life," Tennyson in all of his poetry refutes his friend's assertion.24 In his notes to "The Palace of Art," Tennyson explains that "this poem is the embodiment of my own belief that the Godlike life is with man and for man" (Ricks, 1:436). Here, although he implicitly takes issue with Hallam's aesthetic theory, Tennyson echoes the Theodicaea Novissima, in which Hallam suggests that we are made in God's image by virtue of our passions, and that we are most Godlike when we experience God's own most profound passions, love of Christ, and of our fellow men.25 In this fairly radical doctrine of Hallam's, our spiritual and social impulses come together, a connection which Tennyson's comment about The Palace makes even more explicit. The poem's imagery pushes the implications of such a conflation further. In the first several sections of The Palace, the soul witnesses the erection of her "lordly pleasure-house" (1. 1), and we then walk with her through her newly fashioned galleries of landscape, myth, and history paintings. In the first series of rooms, the soul comes upon a number of landscapes. While each is designed to "fit" the soul's "every mood" (11. 59, 60), all but one contain some discon- certing feature. One room reveals a "gaudy summer-morn," another a sandy landscape "all dark and red" and "Lit with a low round moon" with "some one pacing there alone," and yet another "an iron coast and angry waves" (11. 62, 65, 68, 69). All of these landscapes, with their representations of nature, gaudy, alienating, and angry, reassert Tennyson's resistance to the Wordsworthian vision of a beneficent and spiritually comforting natural world.26 Amid these disturbing sights, however, one room, representing "an English home" (1. 85), provides the only untroubled image in the entire poem. There, "Softer than</page><page sequence="15">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 475 sleep"- and note the echo of the "Ode to Memory," "softer than unbroken rest" (1. 29)- "gray twilight pour[s] / On dewy pastures, dewy trees" and "all things in order" are "stored" in this "haunt of ancient Peace" (11. 85-86, 87, 88). Read through Tennyson's earlier poem, recalling the English home in this moment of The Palace produces the same restorative effect, a calm more peaceful than sleep, as calling forth memory in her divine aspect of native innocence. The salutary spiritual effects of English domesticity return at the conclusion of the poem as well, when the soul repudiates her aesthetic isolation and begs the narrator to "Make [her] a cottage in the vale . . . Where [she] may mourn and pray" (11. 291-292). Isobel Armstrong sees the soul's movement from palace to cottage as a "misguided, punitive course of Christian self-abnegation," but then again, she is not inclined to take Tennyson's note to the poem seriously (p. 83). The cottage in the vale, though, marks a specialized site for Tennyson, as the "Ode to Memory" makes clear. In the earlier poem, the "lowly cottage" provides the setting for memory's first sketches, her most beloved first labors. Memory, as the great artist, privileges the cottage as one of several places of original inspiration, and the fact that the cottage in question turns out to be Tennyson's own childhood vacation residence at Mablethorpe substantiates the poem's suggestion that spots of local and personal significance provide the true sources of the best art (as well, allegorically, as the source of recuperative memory herself)- In "The Palace of Art," the soul must leave the palace for the cottage, for only there can she reestablish her locality, her historicity, and finally her connec- tions to humanity. Within the palace, the soul in fact has no history. In the "jumbled together" representations of various cultures and their myths, the soul, according to Armstrong, makes all cultural expression "contemporary, simultaneous, available, and thus . . . estranged." The soul "drain[s]" her "aesthetic artifacts" of "meaning and history," Armstrong contends, and thereby creates the conditions of her own ensuing alienation (p. 79). For Armstrong, the soul cannot escape the structure which isolates her, for it is her own modern consciousness that cannot form a "principle of relationships with things external" (pp. 82-83). But it seems to me that the soul begs the narrator to build her cottage precisely to form a principle of relationship with the external world, indeed the very Godlike life with men and for men that Tennyson hopes his poem will exemplify. She desires a habitation where she can "mourn and pray"; mourning, though, requires a sense of history. The cottage as site of mourning thus must stand in opposition to the palace from whose eminence the soul proclaims her absolute indifference to human history and suffering: "let the world have peace or wars / 'Tis one to me'" (11. 182-183). As a house not just of mourning, but also of prayer, the cottage brings together both aspects of the divine life Tennyson envisions. The implicit argument of the poem as a whole thus seems to be that, since the Godlike, or spiritual</page><page sequence="16">476 / VICTORIAN POETRY life, issues from our relations with our fellow beings, then strengthening our local, cultural, and even national ties can redeem or revivify our personal spirituality. The reverse would also be true, that if we draw spiritual comfort from those affiliations, we may in turn gird them up as well; that is to say, a mutually reinforcing relationship would obtain between our social, cultural, or national, and our spiritual lives under the aegis of the human-centered "theology" that Tennyson enunciates in connection with the poem. And this, I think, is why the soul asks that her palace not be pulled down; she hopes to return to it "with others" (1. 295), to rebuild the house of art as an institution founded upon the godlike life of human interaction.27 The composition of "The Palace of Art" happens to coincide with an important moment in the early history of the National Gallery in London, one of the nation's first explicitly defined heritage institutions. The Gallery opened in 1824 at 100 Pall Mall, but received another of its great founding collections in 1831. According to Leonee Ormond, Tennyson frequented the galleries at Pall Mall as he worked on The Palace.28 However, Ormond does not consider the possible connections between the poet's patronage of the Gallery and the poem beyond noticing that some of the soul's rooms allude to paint- ings that Tennyson might have seen in his visits to Pall Mall. I would suggest that we see "The Palace of Art" as a response to the Gallery's founding and initial arrangement, both of which were the subjects of heated debate in the 1820s and 1830s.29 The Gallery was founded under rather constrained circum- stances, something Tennyson, as the nephew of an MP, almost certainly would have known. Two great private collections, the Angerstein and the Beaumont, were bequeathed to the nation in 1823-24 provided in the latter case that a suitable gallery might be found to house them (Martin, "The Founding," pp. 281-282). The British Museum was thought to be the best conservator of such a collection, but as negotiations went on, it became clear that not everyone thought so (pp. 281, 282, 285). A House of Commons Select Committee ap- pointed to oversee various negotiations appertaining to the foundation of a national gallery, as well as to the housing of the King's library, issued a report in 1823 which approved of the British Museum as a viable repository for both collections, but which noted in passing that the museum was "in a decaying state" and "not fire-proof (p. 282). Shortly thereafter, the Edinburgh Review published an article criticizing the museum's handling of its natural history collections and its general administrative disorganization (p. 285). The main problem which seemed in fact to be plaguing the museum at this time was that it still functioned as an almost unreformed antiquarian curiosity cabinet, an omnibus institution which housed the Elgin marbles alongside loot from other early imperial endeavors, plus a lively (and living) botanical collection and extensive stuffed and otherwise preserved fauna.30 Alexander Baring, one of the group of those who considered the museum a most unsuitable place</page><page sequence="17">ALLISON ADLER KROLL/ 477 for the national gallery, described the museum as a "mixture of antiquity, books, natural history, and marbles ... a most jumbling and incongruous arrangement" ("The Founding," p. 286). An arrangement, we might note, which sounds very like that of the soul's palace in Tennyson's poem.31 In fact, "The Palace of Art" seems prophetically to call for the rearrange- ment of cultural resources that was to take place in the course of its author's career. The soul's jumbling of cultural artifacts in her palace precludes any one object or scene's having any meaning beyond the aesthetic, and as Arm- strong rightly remarks, such collections quickly become assortments of "luxury commodit[ies]" (p. 79). As regards the artifacts of other cultures, such a mode of collecting presents a moral problem in retrospect, but the real difficulty as far as Tennyson and the English public were concerned was, within such an institution, where might objects of national significance reside? The British Museum in the 1830s was certainly not a place where English things would have any particular significance- they would simply be thrown in with any number of other cultures' bits and pieces and take their place as aesthetic objects just as the Elgin marbles or the Rosetta Stone. It would take thirty-five more years and the advent of archaeology before the British Museum could appropriately define its relationship to indigenous cultural objects,32 but in "The Palace of Art," Tennyson, like those opposed to locating the National Gallery within the museum's precincts, alerted the nation to an important gap in its institutional infrastructure. In 1838, the National Gallery opened at its present location in Trafalgar Square, effectively rendering moot the controversy that had surrounded its original formation.33 But in the fourteen years between the Gallery's founding and taking up of its current residence, the nation had begun to look to its supposed primary cultural repository and found it wanting. As the imaginative transition from an antiquarian to an archaeological apprehension of cultural artifacts took place between 1830 and 1870, the British Museum would undergo many transformations as its Trust- ees slowly responded to increasingly urgent public demands for institutions conservative not just of sundry British possessions, but of English artifacts, English culture, and English identity. Throughout his career, Tennyson re- sponded far more swiftly and consistently to shifts in the collective imagination than the guardians of that noble cabinet, and even prefigured archaeological ways of thinking about cultural identity in the Morte d 'Arthur, In Memoriam, and The Princess, all of which precede the great narratives of the new science that emerged in the second half of the century. When Hallam died in 1833, Tennyson embarked upon a quest to find a solution to the overwhelming physical and metaphysical lack that loss entailed, intensifying his relationship to the set of spiritual issues he was already pursuing poetically. For the ten years following his friend's death, Tennyson immersed himself in questions of spiritual form, in some sense moving backward in his poetic project to a</page><page sequence="18">478 / VICTORIAN POETRY fundamental redefinition of the "theology" that informed culturally engaged poems such as "Timbuctoo", the memory poems, and "The Palace of Art," among others. The cultural and national interests toward which he had been moving in the 1830 and 1832 collections were in large part left to one side as the poet wrote his "poems to Arthur." And whereas he might have provided a voice for the nation's growing concern about its material culture, the future laureate could not bring himself to address the public at this time, much less trouble himself more than obliquely with its cares, and in fact did not publish another collection of his work until 1842. Nonetheless, he had already made some of the most significant statements about the metaphysics of materiality and cultural memory for his era; it only wanted time for the nation at large to recognize his prescience.

Chicago: Univ. of Illinois Press, 2000), particu- larly to the introduction. I see immanence as a Romantic replacement for transcendence rather than as a Victorian one, and so push the timeline back a bit from that which Miller establishes in The Disappearance of God. Where Miller argues that the Victorians heroically attempt to restore immanence within a world of transcendence, 1 would suggest that at least for Tennyson, neither an immanent nor a transcendent world is really even an imaginative possibility; we are stuck, for Tennyson, in the earthly and can only have spiritual experience within that constrained condition. Whether our earthly spiritual experiences have anything to do with the heavenly sphere as envisioned within traditional forms of Christianity is unknowable, hence the groping, lame hands of faith in In Memoriam. 13 Alan G.

While I agree partly with Albright's argument, I do not know that Tennyson's conflict lies in this precise opposition, and would take issue with the notion that Tennyson admits of the earthly appearance of transcendent figures like the muse. Even the seraph meets the speaker of "Armageddon" and "Timbuctoo" at a kind of liminal point, and nowhere in Ten- nyson's poetry do we really get much in the way of the divine inhabiting the earthly, though we will see the earthly informing our sense of the divine. 22 Tennyson: A Selected Edition, ed.

See Black, On Exhibit: Victorians and Their Museums (Charlottesville: Univ. of Virginia Press, 2000), p. 128.
