<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARABIC SOURCES ON IBN PAKUDA'S DUTIES OF THE HEART* Menahem Mansoor Madison 1. Introduction Bahya Ibn Pakuda (c. 1050-1120) is principally recognized for the one work he is known to have written, an ethical, theological treatise, Kitäb al-Hidäyä ila Farä'id al-Qulübd Bahya wrote this work in Arabic though he used Hebrew characters. The standard Arabic edition is that of A.S. Yahuda published in 1912.2 The earliest Hebrew translation of al-Hidäyä was made by Yehuda Ibn Tibbon3 under the title of Hövöt ha-Levävöt ("Duties of the Heart"). The popularity of the work is evidenced not only by the fact that it has been translated into Hebrew, Spanish, Portuguese, Judaeo-Arabic, Yiddish, German, French, and English, but also by the fact that in some of these languages it has passed through numerous editions. The acceptance of Bahya,s thought can be explained not only by its moderate character but perhaps even more by the moderation Bahya used in presenting this thought. He frequently cites passages from the Bible, the Talmud, and the Midrashim as bases for his teachings. Al though at times he was critical of Jewish philosophers for their failure to produce a systematic work on the duties of the heart, he does refer to two Jewish philosophical works: Saadia's Sefer Emünöt Ve-Deöt4 and * The author wishes to express his gratitude to Miss Rita Burns, a graduate assistant in the Department of Hebrew and Semitic Studies, for the preparation of this paper for publication. 1. Henceforth, this book will be referred to simply as al-Hidaya. 2. Al-Hidaja 11a Fara' id Al-Qulub des Bachja Ibn Josef Ibn Paquda, herausgegeben von A.S. Yahuda (Leiden, 1912). 3. Yehuda Ibn Tibbon (1120-1190), translator of Bahya and progenitor of "the Tibbonides", Samuel and Moses, both equally distinguished translators from Arabic into Hebrew, was born in Granada in 1120 and fled to southern France from the persecution of the Almohades in Spain. There he was persuaded by Rabbi Meshullam ben Jacob of Lunel to translate Bahya's first treatise into Hebrew, sines "Arabic was foreign to the Jews outside of Spain." 4. In his Emunot Ve-De'ot (Beliefs and Opinions), Saadia Gaon (882-942) followed the methods of the Kalam on the model of the Mu'tazilites (See fn. 10). He attempted to present the beliefs of Judaism on a philosophic foundation based on the Mu'tazilite</page><page sequence="2">82 MENAHEM MANSOOR a work called Principles of the Law, attributed by some5 to Ben-Hofni.6 Saadia's influence on Bahya is evident in several places, especially in his discussion of the relation between reason and revelation, and in his proof of the existence of God. Bahya also refers to the "Book of Mukammatz," believed to be the work of David Ben Merwan.7 Because Ibn Gabirol claims to be the first to have written a philosophical, ethical treatise and because the ten pairs of antitheses in Gabirol's Tikkün Middöt Hanefesh bear a marked resemblance to the ten faculties of the soul in al-Hidäyä, some assert that Ibn Gabirol influenced Bahya, though the exact relation ship between Ibn Gabirol and Bahya is by no means certain. Bahya's frequent references to Jewish sources is an attempt to assure the reader that his teaching is in the mainstream of traditional Judaism. At the same time, he admits in his introduction to the al-Hidäyä that he does not rely exclusively on Jewish sources. He writes in Chapter 1: "I quote also the saints and sages of other nations whose words have come down to us." One must wonder about the extent to which he departs, in a more or less concealed manner, from the mainstream of traditional Judaism, for the remark suggests that Bahya's thought takes what might be called an objective view of Judaism, one not limited to Jewish sources. The suspicion that somehow Bahya views Judaism from the outside is strengthened by the book's failure to deal with the hope of Messianic redemption, and by the general eclecticism of his method. Bahya specifically identifies his sources only when they are Jewish or when they stem from Greek philosophy. Yet he quotes Islamic sources anonymously. It will not do simply to accuse Bahya of plagiarism, for in his time there was no moral objection to borrowing ideas. The only feasi ble explanation seems to be that sometimes Bahya refuses to reveal his sources in order to make his work seem more Jewish than it really is. In this way, he was able to avoid offending those Jews to whom the use of non-Jewish sources was anathema. arguments of the unity and justice of God. He tried to prove a creation from nothing in time and the idea of the free will of man flowing from the justice of God. 5. M. Steinschneider, Catal. Leyden 108; Catal. Bodl. 2164. 6. Samuel ben Hofni (d. 1034), the last Gaon of Sura, was renowned for his work in Bible exegesis. A strict rationalist, he asserted that reason was superior to tradition in religious matters. His strongly rationalist stand often brought him into open conflict with Saadia's teachings. 7. David ben Merwan al-Mukammatz of Rakka, in Mesopotamia, died in 937. His Book of the Twenty Tractates, the Arabic version of which is now lost, gives proof for the existence of God and His attributes on the basis of the Mu'tazilite Kalam. Two of his polemic tractates argue that Christianity undermines monotheism.</page><page sequence="3">DUTIES OF THE HEART 83 What were these other sources? Yahuda, in the introduction to his Arabic edition of al-Hidäyä, maintains that "saints and sages" means the Moslem ascetics. He goes on to suggest that Bahya borrowed in particular from al-Ghazali8 a great figure in Moslem religious thought who eventual ly became a member of the Sufis,9 a mystic sect within Islam. Yahuda may well go too far in making al-Ghazali almost the sole influence of Bahya's asceticism. After all, "saints and sages," taken at face value, seems to represent a number of influences. Yahuda tries to overcome this objection by insisting that the work of al-Ghazali represents the very essence and distillation of the "saints and sages,יי or Moslem ascetics, and that, furthermore, al-Ghazali's influence on Bahya is demonstrable because his stylistic peculiarities appear in Bahya. Yahuda may have been wrong, but it would be an arduous labour to refute him. Since Bahya does not refer to his Islamic sources, it would involve the difficult task of tracing specific passages back to specific "saints and sages," rather than to al-Ghazali. The scope of the present work is to seek to identify, in broad terms, Islamic sources which may have influenced Bahya's work. 8. The struggle between faith and reason began in the eighth century when the Arabs met Greek thought. The struggle was not one in which the three great religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam fought against one another, since all three of these religious traditions were founded on revelation; the struggle was rather an attempt to reconcile faith with reason, as exemplified in Greek philosophy. Al-Ghazali (1059 1111) was a great figure in Moslem religious thought who became caught up in the on-going struggle. While a professor of religious science in Baghdad, he was tormented by internal struggles which eventually led him to renounce the world in order to search for his lost faith. Turning to Sufism, he found what he sought. He tried thereafter to bring the inwardness and subjectiveness of Sufism into theology, combating philoso phy's stress on reason alone: "Whoever thinks that the understanding of things divine rests upon strict proofs has in his thought narrowed down the wideness of God's mercy." His mysticism and asceticism, like Bahya's, were moderate. Like Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century Christian church, he sought to synthesize, blending the best of philosophy with the best of mysticism into theology and stressing outward observance as strongly as inner spirituality. The full exposition of his thought is in the Ihya' 'Ulum ad-Din, (The Revivification of the Religious Sciences). 9. The Sufis derive their name from the Arabic suf, meaning "wool", because of their custom of wearing woolen garments as a means of symbolizing the asceticism that characterized the early Sufic movement. Under the influence of the eastern religions and Gnosticism, the Sufis turned to mysticism, pursuing a perfect union with God, and then the total absorption of the self into the Deity. Here Jewish mysticism, stressing distance between the transcendent Creator and his creature, did not follow.</page><page sequence="4">84 MENAHEM MANSOOR II. The Kalam During the eighth century, the rationalistic school of the Mu'tazilites10 founded a rational theology and began calling themselves Mutakallimun, a term used to designate those who used the methods of the philosophers to defend their own principles. In order to meet the arguments of philo sophers who denied the authority of revelation and assigned only relative value to religion, the Mutakallimun were forced to develop a method of argumentation which, in a sense, borrowed from their opponents. Using reason as a standard, they sought a reconciliation between philosophy and religion which would, at the same time, be a justification of revelation. The method employed by the Mutakallimun is called Kalam,11 an Arabic equivalent of the Greek logos meaning "speech, reason."12 10. The Mu'tazilites "separatists" (from Arabic i'tazala, meaning "to separate oneself") arose in the eighth century when Wasil ibn-Atha al-Ghazali dissented from al-Basir, leader of the theological schools, declaring that God is not anthropomorphic, but rather He is an absolute unity without attributes. He also declared that man is a free agent and all knowledge for his salvation emanates from his reason. Seeking support in philosophy, the Mu'tazilites founded the rational theology, 'Ilm-al-Kalam (Science of the Word) and called themselves Mutakallimun. (See next note on Kalam). The Mu'tazilites hold that knowledge is threefold; it is to be found in the Koran, in tradition, and in reason. This thought is anti-Aristotelian since it holds to a theory of creatio ex nihilo as against Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity of matter. The Mu'tazilite view of creation was influenced by Democritus' theory of atomism, applied not only to the material world, but to time. By using the methods of philosoph ers, the Mu'tazilites incurred the wrath of the orthodox theologians; and for holding orthodox views of Islam, they were attacked by the philosophers. In the ninth century, there arose an orthodox reaction against rationalist tendencies and the Mu'tazilites were persecuted by the Caliph al-Mutawakkil (847-861). 11. The Kalam (from the Arabic meaning "speech, reason") was, in essence, the method by which the orthodox theologians defended their views against the arguments of the philosophers. They did this by using the rationalist methods of the philosophers as a weapon against them. The followers of the Kalam apposed Aristotle's doctrine of the eternity of the world, advancing instead the atomistic theory of Democritus, that the world, and all that is in it, including time, is made of indivisible uniform particles constantly being created. Using the principles of physics, those who followed the Kalam held to creation from nothing in time. From this point, they argued for the existence of a creator, since nothing can create itself. Starting with Saadia, Jewish thinkers were much influenced by the Kalam. They proved God's existence by showing that the wonders of the world reveal a creator, who must be One, a Unity, since only a unity can be perfect. Thus, they believed, the unity of God is central and all limiting attributes and anthropomorphisms must be eliminated. 12. In general, logos (from the Greek logo, meaning "I say") translated as "word", "reason", "speech", represents the principle of intelligence in the universe. It was early linked with nous, the rational organizing principle of Plato's universe, seen by</page><page sequence="5">DUTIES OF THE HEART 85 Bahya employs the Kalam method of argumentation in the early philosophical sections of the al-Hidäyä. However, it must be noted that the influence of the Kalam here is more or less restricted to method. Bahya does not necessarily reflect ideas developed by the Mutakallimun. His primary concern is not to develop a philosophical justification of religion before the bar of reason but rather to articulate devoutness of the heart. Kalam influence can easily be seen in Bahya's chapters on "The Unity of God" and "The Justice of God." An examination of relevant passages shows that the Kalam influences is real though not as extensive as customarily assumed. A. "The Unity of God" While he rejects some of the teachings of the Mutakallimun, Bahya undoubtedly borrows from them when he developed his idea of the creation of the world in time. This is a teaching of decisive importance both to him and the to Mutakallimun. Bahya's proofs for the temporal creation of the world are based, as in the Kalam, on such matters as the limits of space, the composition of things, the concept of accident and so forth. Bahya's philosophical arguments are not exclusively Kalam, but rather a combination of Kalam arguments with Neoplatonic and Aristotelian ideas. Bahya, unlike the Mutakallimun, does not discuss incorporeality as a separate subject because his Neo-Platonic view of the unity of God does not need an independent proof of incorporeality. Bahya's Neo platonic strain of thought was, in part, responsible too for his identifica tion of God with unity and his theory of negative attributes. Mutakal limun writings assert that the essence and attributes of God are identical. One of Bahya's proofs for the temporal creation of the world is based on the Aristotelian doctrine that actual infinites cannot exist. However, he reaches a conclusion that is the very opposite of Aristotle's, for Aristotle proves the eternity of the universe. This is an interesting paradox, for the Kalam proofs for creation are based on a self-conscious opposition to Aristotelian philosophy. Thus, starting from Aristotle, unlike the Mutakallimun, Bahya has reached a conclusion that is in agreement with theirs. Aristotle as a thinking entity. The Stoics thought of logos as the rational principle of the universe, a penetrating force that is also the reasonable part of man's soul. It was Philo who spoke of this Universal Reason as the Divine Mind, the link between God and the universe. This is the force that is the Divine Will of Gabirol. The Targum uses a sense of logos (memra, "word") in place of the anthropomorphisms of the Bible.</page><page sequence="6">86 MEN AHEM MANSOOR In spite of his departures from the Kalam, Bahya does not overcome the fundamental weakness of the Kalam proof of temporal creation. His proof of creation ex-nihilo fails to make a convincing argument against the possibility of the eternity of matter. Such an argument would have to demonstrate that primary form and matter come under the categories of creation and annihilation. The absence of such an argument is a typical weakness of the Kalam, and its absence in Bahya,s work tends to show that he is relying on the Kalam when he discusses temporal creation. B. "The Justice of God" The idea of the justice of God is a second principal doctrine common to Mutakallimun theology and Bahya's work. This doctrine is particularly significant because it leads to a discussion of free will, an essential ingre dient of Bahya's ethical teaching. He must overcome the antithesis between the Kalam''s assertion of the freedom of God's will, not subject to the order of nature, and the God of the Aristotelian philosophers, who is subject to the immutability of the natural order. He tries to do this by the Mu'tazilite distinction between limbs and heart. According to this distinction, man is free in matters pertaining to the heart while God intervenes in the externalization of human action. Bahya's teaching in this matter amounts ultimately to a borrowing and a modification of the Mu'tazilite idea. Bahya's explanation of the existence of evil shows his implicit accept ance of the Mu'tazilite view that God is necessarily just. Evil, he says, is usually a result of man's wrongdoing and this is evidence of man's free will. Yet Bahya does not assert a strict connection between evil and wrongdoing; he admits that in this world the innocent suffer, their compensation lying in a world to come. III. Sufism and Zuhd (Asceticism)1^ There is no denying the great influence of the mystical Sufist sect on Bahya. Bahya's terminology, style, and language all bear the marks of Sufist literature, though it is difficult to establish exact sources on which 13. Zuhd, the Islamic conception of asceticism, began in the city of Medina shortly after the death of Muhammad among groups of his followers who sought to follow his example of simple and pious living. In time, the Zuhd concept spread throughout the Arab world. Early Islamic ascetics were responsible for an intensification of the movement, turning the Zuhd into a movement of asceticism in its fullest sense: renun ciation of the world, devotion to prayer, and repentance.</page><page sequence="7">DUTIES OF THE HEART 87 he drew.14 The very name of his book shows Sufist influence, for many Sufist authors used the word "qulub" (hearts) in the titles of their treatises and from this one may assume that Bahya adopted as well the distinction they made between the duties of the limbs and the duties of the heart. Generally speaking, ideas of asceticism and mysticism are not new to Jewish tradition, as they are especially evident in prophetic literature. Nevertheless, Bahya's way of expressing these ideas is not Jewish. He replaces the distinction between intention and deed with the distinction between two kinds of duties. It is true that Bahya does not ignore the significance of social ethics, the relations of man with man, but he regards it as the natural outcome of correct religious behaviour. He pushes the active element of ethics into the background in an effort to make room for the element of purity. The result is that his dualism is far stronger than that of the traditional Jewish literature. It divides the body from the mind, the spiritual from the sensual. Bahya's ascetic ethics approaches Neoplatonism, but there is a differ ence: Bahya does not think in terms of freeing the soul for a mystical union with God, or for the attainment of speculative knowledge of the spiritual world. Instead, he seeks to free the soul for the proper worship of God with one's heart. Thus, in regard to his dependence on Moslem ascetics and mystics, as in the case of his use of the Kalam, one observes that Bahya's eclecticism is selective. Despite Sufist influence, Bahya grants certain rights to sensuality. He stops short of advocating mysticism or excessive asceticism. IV. Islamic Writers Likely to Have Influenced Bahya 1. al-Makki As has been said, the title of Bahya's book shows the literary influence of those moral-ascetic writers of Islam who used the term "qulub" (hearts) in their titles, and with it the distinction between the heart and the limbs. One such author is Abu Taleb al-Makki.15 The plan of Bahya's 14. In this connection, however, it is misleading to read Bahya in Tibbon's Hebrew translation, which sometimes introduces a mystical terminology for which there is no warrant in the original Arabic. For example, in section 9 of the chapter of "The Unity of God", one of the sages is asked where God is to be found. He answers, bil-mirsad ("in the lookout"), a term that alludes to a passage in the Koran (Sura 89, v. 13). Tibbon translated bil-mirsad ("in the lookout") as besipiyya ("in expectation") and thus suggests a mystical connotation which the original text does not contain. 15. Abu Talib al-Makki (d. 996) was an Arab mystic. Mysticism in Islam began as an ascetic movement that fell under the influence of Neoplatonism and Gnosticism. The</page><page sequence="8">MENAHEM MANSOOR book also corresponds to al-Makki's classification of the degrees of devoutness. Love of God is the highest of the nine degrees of knowledge in al-Makki's Qut al-qulub even as it is Bahya's al-Hidäyä. Bahya does not borrow blindly from al-Makki. He agrees with him that the intensity of the love of God is determined by motivation — the purer the love, the more disinterested it is — but where al-Makki emphasizes the love of God for man, Bahya stresses man's attitude to God. Other traces of influence of Qut-al-qulub can be found in Bahya's chapter on "Spiritual Reckoning" and in his treatise, "On Repentance." 2. al-Muhasibi The title of Bahya's book may also reflect the influence of al-Harith al-Muhasibi,16 an early Islamic ascetic. In al-Muhasibi's doctrine of the soul, there exists a permanent tension between man's pure reason and his concupiscence, a lower consciousness whose function it is to preserve the body. There seems to be an obvious link between al-Muhasibi and Bahya with respect to asceticism. It is, of course, possible that Bahya was only indirectly influenced by al-Muhasibi, whose teachings on the purification of the soul left their mark on later ascetics and Sufis. It is possible, too, that the dialogue in Bahya's chapter on "The Service of God" may derive from the influence of al-Muhasibi, who used this form to reflect the dialectic of the soul. 3. al-Mutanabbi In Chapter 16 of Yahuda's Arabic edition of al-Hidaya, Bahya cites a verse from the poet al-Mutanabbi,17 a verse not translated by lbn Tibbon. oldest treatise to deal with moral-asceticism in Islamic mysticism is al-Makki's Qut al-qulub. 16. Harith b. Asad al-Muhasibi, ("The Self-Examiner") d. 857), most famous Sufi teacher of the ninth century, was given the title "al-Muhasibi" because he was constant ly engaged in introspective thought, and thus was truly "The Self-Examiner." As a mystic theologian, he opposed the Mu'tazilites, using their own methods against them, as they had used the methods of the philosophers in establishing themselves. He eventually turned to a complete renunciation of the world and is remembered as a mystic who had philosophical knowledge along with belief in the old tradition, all the while seeking inner purification. Al-Muhasibi's work Ri'aya li-Huquq Allah is a guide to the inner life and the pursuit of perfect purity. It was used by al-Ghazali and the succeeding generation of Arabic-speaking Muslim mystics. 17. Abu-al-Tayyib al-Mutanabbi (905-965), "He who professes to be a prophet,' was a great Arab poet celebrated throughout the Middle Ages and into modern time,</page><page sequence="9">DUTIES OF THE HEART 89 4. al-Ghazali There is little doubt that Bahya was generally influenced by Arabic literature and science, but it has been maintained that the on'y particular influence evident in his work is that of his contemporary, al-Ghazali (1059-1111). Yahuda and scholars who agree with his view18 have been unable to demonstrate conclusively any direct influence of al-Ghazali on Bahya. Yahuda111 was the first to compare the text of al-Ghazali's tractate, al-Hikma fi Makhluqat Allah with the al-Hidaya. He found certain parallels which he took to be evidence of Bahya's dependence on al-Ghazali. Of course, the question of the relationship between Bahya and al-Ghazali cannot be separated from the question of the date of composi tion of the al-Hidaya. Yahuda assumes that al-Ghazali did influence Bahya and he maintains that the al-Hidaya was written after al-Ghazali's work between 1105 and 1156. Critics of Yahuda's opinion20 have raised the possibility that both al-Ghazali and Bahya drew from a common and earlier Arab source. It has been suggested21 that such a source might have been the Brethren of Purity,22 a secret brotherhood which arose during for his work, Diwan. As a philosopher, he adopted Stoicism, throwing off religious dogma. As a poet and panegyrist of intense pro-Arab feeling, he made his greatest fame with his songs in praise of the deeds of Saif al-Dawla, Smir of Aleppo, and his wars against the Byzantine and the Bedouins. He is called the greatest of all Arab poets 18. D. Rosin, Die Ethik der Maimonides (Breslau, 1876), 60ff. W.

From the time the Muslims encountered Greek theology in the eighth century, agitations sprang up that led to schisms. Sects arose in Judaism as well as Islam. One such group was the "Brethren of Purity" (Ikhwan al-Safa). This group compiled an encyplopedia of fifty-one treatises that embodied their ideas on mathematics, philoso phy, logic, the general sciences and anthropology. Many of their ideas were derived from Aristotle, others such as that of the World Soul were derived from Neoplatonism and Mu'tazilite ideas about the theological sciences. The encyclopedia was responsible</page><page sequence="10">90 MENAHEM MANSOOR the ninth century and whose work, "Encyclopaedia of Sciences," attempted to coordinate the truths of Greek philosophy and science with the truths of the Islamic faith. Another argument against Bahya's dependence on al-Ghazali is the view that Bahya was ignorant of Avicenna,23 a Moslem philosopher whose views on the doctrine of emanation were contested by al-Ghazali. Summary In Bahya's times theology encountered philosophy. A real or alleged gap separated the world from God and there occurred a twofold reaction. Rationalists attempted to provide a firm intellectual and scientific grounding for religion. Mystics responded by overlooking the duality itself, denying that there was any "world" apart from God. In the Arabic sources available by Bahya, both responses appear. Yahuda argues that, more than any other Jewish philosopher of his era, Bahya drew on Arab philosophers, taking their questions and problems and investigating them from a Jewish perspective. On the other hand, the writings of Islam's moral ascetics are reflected in Bahya's emphasis on the distinction of duties and his attention to the "duties of the heart." The very fact that the al-Hidaya was written in Arabic leads one to speculate about Arabic influence on the work. Though the work is replete with references to traditional Jewish teaching, Bahya's dependence on Islamic philosophers and moral ascetics is indisputable, though he fails to credit them explicitly in his work. for the Neoplatonic influence on Jewish philosophy through its effect on Bahya, Gabirol, Ibn-Zaddik and Yehuda Halevi. The Brethren were rationalists and taught, like Galen, and later Bahya and others, that in Creation itself lies the proof of the Creator, of His unity and of His justice. In Spain in the mid-eleventh century, they were widely read by the Jews. 23. Avicenna (Ibn-Sina) (980-1037) was a Persian-born physician and philosopher and an encyclopedist of great logical and systematizing power. His thought was rooted in the Neoplatonic commentaries on Aristotelian doctrines, and it was his labour to systematize all that was important in his time. His encyclopedia of medicine the Al-Qanum fi-al Tibb (Canon in Medicine), influenced the West down to the seven teenth century and made Avicenna, "The Arab Galen." His great encyclopedia of philosophy, the Kitab al-Shifa (Book of Healing), contained his theory of creation, strongly Neoplatonic in cast. He expounded the view that earthly happenings are influenced by the stars, with light as an intermediary. The theme of light has influenced Christian thinkers, especially the Platonist Franciscan followers of Duns Scotus who sided with Ibn Gabirol.</page></plain_text>
