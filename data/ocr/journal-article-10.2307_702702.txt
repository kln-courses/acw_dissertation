Sept exposes et discussions. (Entretiens sur l'Antiquit6 Clas- sique, Tome i.) Pp. 308. Vandceuvres, Geneva: Fondation Hardt (Cambridge: Heffer), 1954- Cloth, ?2. THIS series of lectures is opened by H. J. Rose with a useful survey of religious antiquities and of the theological problems, such as the prosperity of the wicked, which troubled the Greeks, at least from Theognis onwards. He begins 'as far back as we can go'; but very soon we come to Homer, whose 'barons', we are told, were 'singularly enlightened', apparently for the negative reason that they had no great awe in the presence of divine beings. They did, however, foreshadow the doctrine of a 'transcendental Deity' by their recognition of a gulf between man and the gods with their great power and knowledge and freedom from death. Similarly the lower orders, for whom Hesiod acts as spokesman, promoted in some degree the belief in the omnipresence of Deity by their cult of 'numerous local objects of worship', a tendency which led, paradoxically enough, to the comparative neglect of Zeus (no doubt, by the higher orders as well) even in the Athens of Aeschylus. In general, it is held that, despite some traces of mana, the typical Greek belief was in a personal god or gods, not in an impersonal force. This sound observation seems to have made insufficient impact upon one or two of the subsequent lectures. It is worth noting that Rose finds little or no trace in Homer of the view that the gods are subject to a higher law which keeps their conflicts within bounds. He perhaps overstresses the absence of 'an all-powerful orthodoxy' among the Greeks, and his treatment of the trials for impiety seems too cursory; in particular, the</page><page sequence="2">120 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW indictment of Socrates receives an interpretation ('interference with the estab- lished State cults', etc.) which appears to me to run rather wide of the evidence. The Homeric picture is described in more detail by P. Chantraine, who argues that Homer's anthropomorphism is 'a profoundly rationalistic con- ception'. Homer describes inanimate objects (like the river Scamander) in human terms; he 'mythologizes' abstractions (like Hypnos or Phobos) ; and this method is, according to Chantraine, akin to explaining things by their physical causes. The lecturer did not seem to favour the suggestion that literary motives might account for much of the 'humanity' of such entities. It is of interest that Homer is no longer thought incapable of abstract thought. The theme of personification and that of the supremacy of Zeus, who, it is stressed, has some concern for justice between man and man even in Homer, lead directly to the examination of Hesiod's theology in the third lecture. Here B. Snell neatly illustrates Hesiod's method of abstraction and systematization from the names of the nine Muses, which provide 'a poetics in theological form'. In both these lectures there is a tendency to overestimate the sweetness and light which are thought to mark the deities of Homer by contrast with those of Hesiod, though admittedly Homer's gods are frequently irrational, unpredictable, and danger- ous to approach. At any rate it is made clear that Hesiod allows more for the dismal side of life and myth; and despite his insistence on the supremacy of Zeus and his justice, he is accordingly regarded as 'the founder of dualism in Greek thought'-a title which seems to me very much open to question. The theology of the pre-Socratics is very thoroughly discussed by O. Gigon, who defends his own position against that of Jaeger, particularly on Xeno- phanes. He considers the development of Ionian philosophy up to, and including, Democritus, as largely an attempt to overcome men's fear of earth- quakes, lightning, and other natural phenomena. The process involved much purification of the idea of the divine from primitive crudities or (for primitiv- ism was one of the questions at issue) its restoration to primitive purity. Gigon shows how different inferences were drawn from the fact that man worships gods whereas the beasts do not; if the beasts are right, atheism results; if they are not, the discussion proceeds legitimately to such matters as the interest of the gods in human affairs and such theories as the full-blown teleo- logy found in Xenophon's Memorabilia. The main contention of H. F. D. Kitto seems to be that the gods in Aeschylus and Sophocles 'represent' the background of rationality and moral law without which (though it must be owned that the point did not occur to Aristotle) the dramatic action would lack the kind of universality described in the Poetics. This is thought to account for the double causation, divine and human, of particular acts: is it, for example, Apollo's grudge or Clytaemnestra's jealousy which causes the death of Cassandra? The answer seems to be: both, acting quite independently of each other. If it be objected that Apollo's proceedings create more problems than they solve, it would, I imagine, be pointed out that Apollo becomes a reformed character in the later plays of the trilogy. Everyone, Zeus, Agamemnon, and the rest, becomes 'improved'; and this improvement 'reflects' the progress of city-state civilization. Apparently then, in Kitto's view, the moral order which outgrows its imperfections has no existence inde- pendent of human history; the gods are impersonal 'forces' wholly contained within the world, 'never external to our universe'. It seems to me that Zeus was for Aeschylus rather more important than that. Sophocles is similarly</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 121 interpreted, except that for him no development needs to be assumed in the rationality of the universe. Oracles are regarded as part of that rationality (though few of them seem to support this view)--did not Sophocles tell us in the 0. T. that without oracles life would be a random, irrational affair? 'The fact that all could be predicted shows that all obeyed rational law' (my italics). I should need stronger evidence before accrediting Sophocles with an argu- ment of such doubtful validity. For F. Chapouthier, who regrettably died before the publication of this book, the most striking quality of Euripides is his receptiveness. Euripides welcomed ideas and information from all quarters, but did not trouble to systematize what he took from others. As he was not a coherent thinker about gods or anything else his theological views never change, never progress. Nevertheless he did a service by insisting on the essential connexion of such qualities as justice and purity with the idea of the divine. This lecture seems to me the best piece of exposition in the book. The report of the subsequent discussion shows that the belief in Euripides as primarily an 'intellectual' dies hard. In the final lecture W. J. Verdenius gives his interpretation of Plato's con- cept of God. He regards the idea of Good as the supreme god, but as he regards this god as an inactive, impersonal, absolute principle of order, the equation seems merely to reduce deity to ideality. The other ideas are 'transpositions' of the idea of Good on to the plane of multiplicity; and they also are 'gods', for Verdenius identifies the 'everlasting gods' of Tim. 37 c with the ideas which the Demiurge copies. In what sense the Demiurge is thought to carry out this task is not clear, for he too is 'fundamentally an abstraction', the productive 'aspect' of the idea of Good, though not an emanation. This 'aspect', the Demiurge, migrates from Tim. to Laws x to produce another 'aspect', the 'best soul'. There are many 'strata', increasing in concreteness in proportion to their distance from the highest principle. The star-gods belong to one of these; and still lower are the Olympian gods, who are 'reflections' or 'repre- sentations' of 'the abstract ideas'. If this system really were Plato's, it would still fail to explain his non-mythical references to gods, since gods would be superfluous to its workings. This follows equally from Verdenius's quite un- discriminating treatment of inspiration, according to which human effort and divine aid are merely two ways of saying the same thing. It has not been possible in this review to make many references to the dis- cussions which follow the several lectures; they are as full of interest as the prepared discourses.
