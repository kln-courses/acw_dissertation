<plain_text><page sequence="1">Study Group on Music Archaeology International Council for Traditional Music, Third International Meeting Kenneth J. DeWoskin The Study Group on Music Archaeology of the International Council for Traditional Music held its third international meeting in Hannover and Wolfenbüttel, November 16-21, 1986. Under the primary sponsorship of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), Bonn, over forty scholars assembled to hear some thirty papers presented and discussed and to hear sounds and music from early instruments as diverse as bone whistles, sounding stones, clay vessel flutes, and plastic pipes. Music archaeology is a relatively new sub- specialty. It was born from a set of paradoxical concerns. In contrast to painting and literature, music in its essential form is the most fleeting of arts, performed in time, and not necessarily leaving a trace of material evidence. Recon- struction of past music would seem to be the most hopeless task an archaeologist might undertake. At the same time, iconographie finds are often rich in representations of music and dance performances. And archaeological work around the world in recent decades has produced a wealth of objects, some dating back to the Upper Paleolithic and the world of Cro- Magnum, that appear to be sound producers. Whereas some are identified as hunting whis- tles, battle alarms, and various ritual noise makers, many are musical instruments. Some are still playable and promise insights into the sounds of man's earliest music. It is undeniable that music played a major role in most early cultures. The extent to which we can legitimately infer characteristics of early music from the often minimal material evidence was an issue of abiding theoretical interest to the conference participants, and an issue to which we will return below before concluding this report. There was agreement among participants that the interpretation of much archaeological mate- rial requires the cooperation of archaeologists, musicologists, and other technical specialists, from which something greater can emerge than the sum of their individual expertise working independently. The meetings were convened and organized by Ellen Hickmann, Chair of the Study Group and Professor of the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Hannover. Assisting her were the Secretary of the Study Group, Cajsa S. Lund of Stockholm, and the Editor of the Bulletin, Catherine Homo of Paris. The opening session on November 17 was Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="2">646 Berichte und Kommentare chaired by Bo Lawergren of Hunter College, New York City. Catherine Homo reported on "Whistles and Calls Recently Found in the Louvre Excavations." The construction work on the Louvre entrance has yielded some in- triguing zoomorphic ceramic whistles, mostly bird-shaped. Homo discussed the problems in dating the pieces, identifying their function in early Parisian urban culture, and accounting for the accumulation of such whistles at this site. Roksandra Pejovic of Beograd reported on "Music Scenes on the Antique Vases in the Sarajevo Museum and their Part in the Illustra- tions of the Greek's Everyday Life." She dis- cussed instruments and dance as represented on various classical media, especially painted vases, and outlined the special problems in interpreting iconographie sources for their information on musical practices. Ingrid De Geer of Uppsala presented a paper entitled "The Orkney Earldom in an Archaeo-musico- logical Perspective: A Survey Based on Chrono- logical Charts and Maps." Her discussion of this twelfth-century culture center featured maps of relic distributions in Europe, from which she argued for Orkney's function as a bridge be- tween Celtic and Norse cultural manifestations. The morning session was concluded by Ann Buckley of Cambridge, discussing "Musical Instrument Finds from Medieval Dublin: A Multicultural Perspective." Excavations from the middle-ages in Dublin have yielded flutes and other musical instrument parts that Buckley demonstrated were profitably analyzed from a number of perspectives. Chaired by Doris Stockmann of East Ber- lin, the afternoon session began with Mette Müller of Copenhagen speaking of "An Early Bagpipe Find." A fractured and incomplete Viking-age flute segment, the Falster pipe, was interpreted to be an early bagpipe tube through comparison with a number of similarly shaped pipes discovered in several Scandinavian sites in recent decades. Olle Henschen-Nyman of Vis- by, Sweden, introduced "Swedish Sounding Stones from Various Ages." Several granite boulders that are still known as sounding or singing stones by local residents were illustrated and discussed in terms of their placement, sound, and probable ritual use. The afternoon session concluded with Cajsa S. Lund on "Flutes in Societies of Scandinavia prior to 800 A. D.: Theory and Data." After discussion of a chart detailing field and laboratory approaches to musical objects, her presentation focused on a prehistoric bone whistle fragment and pro- posed a possible relation to bird and otter hunt- ing. She concluded with a brief performance on a bone flute. In the evening, Werner Bachmann of Leip- zig presented a detailed review of prehistoric and early historic instruments in museums in the German Democratic Republic. Ivan Macák of Bratislava discussed "The freák, a Puzzling Instrument of the 9th Century A. D." Although the freák has been identified as a sound pro- ducer, perhaps a flute of some type, no one has yet discovered how it might have been played. The second morning began with a presenta- tion by Bo Lawergren of New York and O. R. Gurney of Oxford entitled "Vertical and Hori- zontal Harps (mainly from Mesopotamia)." After illustrating common marks found on ver- tical harps as widely distributed as Ancient Mesopotamia and Pazyryk, they argued that this mark might be identified as Abzami, the ear of the Zami, and, by analysis of parallel Sumerian and Akkadian lexigraphs, that Zami was a harp, not a lyre as previously argued. Lothar Siemens Hernandez of Grand Canary presented slides and tapes of natural sounding stones of the Canary Islands. Large basaltic stones show evidence of having been used for millennia as sound producers, and, when struck at the indicated points with hand-held stones, emit a range of tones. The morning session concluded with Rolf Rottländer of Tübingen presenting a paper entitled „Rohrflöten und Einheiten antiker Längenmasse." Written sources and archaeological materials were ana- lyzed to propose standards of measurements re- lated to pitchpipe lengths in a variety of ancient civilizations. The second afternoon, chaired by Joachim Braun of Ramat Gan, began with Lise Manni- che of Cambridge discussing "The Erotic Oboe (Ancient Egypt)." Slides of a variety of graphic representations were shown, some very explicit, making quite clear the erotic side of Egyptian oboe lore. Annie Bélis of Athens presented Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="3">Berichte und Kommentare 647 "The Greek Aulos: Archaeological and Written Testimonies." Much hitherto unpublished icon- ographie and epigraphic evidence was shown on the nature and use of the Aulos oboe of Ancient Greece. Ismael Fernández de la Cuesta of Madrid discussed "Some Roman Fragments of Aerophones (2nd/3rd Century A. D.) from Clunia Augusta in the Archaeological Museum of Burgos." Paz Cabello Carro of Madrid pre- sented "Approaches to Precolumbian Music through the Collections of the Museo de Améri- ca/Madrid." She showed a large number of slides illustrating vessel flutes and other instru- ments of Pre-Columbian cultures and comment- ed on their zoomorphic designs. The afternoon session concluded with Vincent Megaw of Bed- ford Park, Australia, whose presentation "The Emperor's New Clothes: The New Music Archaeology" mounted a broad challenge to many of the current assumptions in the field. After cautioning conference participants that they stood quite bare if garbed mainly in eth- nographic analogies and the like, Megaw per- formed a comprehensive and entertaining slide and tape retrospect of recent music archaeology work, with the help of Albrecht Schneider of Hamburg. The third morning was chaired by Albrecht Schneider and began with Reis Flora of Victo- ria, Australia, presenting "Musical Evidence at Selected Archaeological Sites in Rajasthan and Gujarat." This study of Indus Valley civilization concentrated on iconographie materials and included comments on the still undeciphered pictographic elements in many paintings, one of which is interpreted as someone playing a dou- ble-headed drum. Anders Hammarlund of Far- sta, Sweden, followed with "Kaval, nay, glasba, blur: Open End-blown Flutes in Western Asia and South East Europe and their Roots and Roles in Prehistoric Shepherd Cultures." He reported on his extensive fieldwork with living shepherd cultures and performed on a variety of end-blown flutes to demonstrate the rich musi- cal potential of several aerophonic designs, including the very simplest. The morning ses- sion concluded with Maurice Faulkner of Gole- ta, California, presenting "Prehistoric Musical Instruments and Totemism as by Archaeologi- cal and Ethnological Data." He concentrated on a decorative bronze kettle drum (tonggu) of the Dongtsun culture, presently in the Singapore National Museum, commenting on the ritual context of their musical use. Some additional comments on decorative bronze drums from Southwest China and South East Asia were offered by Magdalene von Dewall of Heidel- berg, who recently published "DI AN: Ein ver- sunkenes Königreich in China," a scholarly catalog for an exhibition that includes such drums from Yunnan China (organizer: Museum Rietberg, Zürich). The final morning of formal presentations was chaired by Gen'ichi Tsuge of Tokyo. Liu Shiyue of Tientsin, China, presented "Bone Flutes of Hemudu in Chekiang China," a report on a cache of bird tibia flutes and whistles recently discovered in a 7000 year old site near Shanghai. Liu emphasized the probable role of such instruments in the advanced hunting prac- tices of the Hemudu culture. Kenneth DeWos- kin of Ann Arbor, Michigan, presented a paper entitled "The Evolution of the Stopped Globu- lar Flute in Late Neolithic and Bronze Age China," a survey of vessel flutes from several sites and periods ranging from 5000 to 1000 B. C. Based on differentiated aerophones from key finds, he proposed a model for the evolu- tion of instruments from unstopped bone and ceramic pipes of the neolithic to the mature and standardized vessel flutes of the bronze age. David Hughes of Leiden reported on "Strings and Winds of Protohistoric Japan: Problems in Music Archaeology." Covering all classes of instruments in the three broad protohistoric periods from ca. 10,000 B. C. to A. D. 650, he emphasized the difficulties in interpreting the context of instrument use and the anomalous evolution of instrument types. Dale Olsen of Tallahassee, Florida, presented "The Magic Flutes of El Dorado: A Model for Research in Archaeo-Musicology as Applied to the Sinu of Ancient Colombia." The crocodilian shapes and caymen reliefs integral to many of the Sinú flutes relate to animals important in contempo- rary fertility rites. Olsen argued that this links the zoomorphic instruments and their music to such ritual contexts. His presentation was accompanied by a drawing showing four paths to understanding of early music cultures. The Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="4">648 Berichte und Kommentare final presentation of the morning was Ellen Hickmann, "Vessel Flutes from Precolombian Coast Cultures of Ecuador." In the context of Ecuadorian archaeology and musicology, she presented slides showing several types of zoo- morphic and anthropomorphic vessel flutes and proposed an agenda for systematic analysis of their musical and cultural functions. After conclusion of the formal sessions, the group visited the Roemer-Pelizaeus Museum in Hildesheim, where Dr. Arne Eggebrecht intro- duced the protocol for a loose leaf catalog of antiquities, exemplified by his "Lose-Blatt Katalog der Ägyptologie." At the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe in Hamburg on November 20, a joint session was convened including archaeologists from various fields of the Archäologisches Institut of Hamburg University and from Hamburg museums. The group heard a presentation by Tadeusz Malinowski of Slupsk, Poland, on cooperation between musi- cologists and archaeologists and discussed at length future directions for the study group. Throughout the conference, we were graced with the presence of wind ensembles from the Hochschule für Musik and Theater in Hanno- ver, providing brief performances between ses- sions. We had the opportunity to visit a number of exhibitions and museums of antiquity as well as the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenbüt- tel. On the final day, a formal reception was held in the Hamburg Rathaus. The group frequently discussed key theoret- ical issues in the analysis of early sound makers and musical instruments. Cooperation between musicologists and archaeologists is in its infan- cy, and many presentations were reflective about the prospects and the difficulties of such cooperation. Several members attempted to synthesize divergent positions on theoretical and methodological issues that had been voiced in previous meetings and publications/The use of diverse terminology, including "Music Archaeology," "Archaeo-Musicology," and "Archaeo-Organology," to mention only a few, is indicative of the effort required to forge a central and common methodological foundation for future work. Certainly no perfect consensus was achieved, but at this third international meeting, significant progress was made in out- lining future strategies for interpreting musical artifacts from the past. These strategies divide roughly into several parallel paths to a well-informed picture of music and its role in early cultures. First and most fundamental are scientific archaelogical methods, which must be brought to bear on the objects. These include excavation and docu- mentation, stratigraphie analysis, dating by direct analysis and analysis of proximate objects, find context, and associated relics. One specialized goal of general archaeological methods is to develop a type-model of the cul- ture that specifies the soundscape, the acousti- cal environment, including animal sounds, in which the residents lived. For example, analysis of bird remains, both those manufactured into tibia whistles and those in bone pits, provides several perspectives on the soundscape of a fishing-hunting-gathering society. General ar- chaeological methods are to be supplemented by acoustical and other laboratory measure- ments of the sound makers, for tonometric, spectral, and range capacity and analysis of materials and manufacturing process, with spe- cial reference to the technological ability to control sound qualities. Cross-cultural comparisons, properly quali- fied, contribute to the interpretation of the objects. Lurking beneath such comparisons are issues of cultural diffusion versus independent development. In the case of music, biophysical, acoustical, and psychoacoustical factors in cross-cultural comparisons must be explicit in claims for kinship, coincidence, and general modeling inferred from multiple cases. These factors are well understood in and of themselves but less well-understood in the manner and degree to which, as human and environmental universais, they constrain the development of music in any given culture. Iconographie analysis was central to many presentations, but objections were always rais- ed to direct and sole reliance on sculpted and painted images of musicians, instruments, and dancers for understanding early music, especial- ly in the context of other archaeological evi- dence. Conventions of representation, idealiza- tion, symbolization, limitations of media, and the like contribute to a potentially high level of Anthropos 82.1987</page><page sequence="5">Berichte und Kommentare 649 distortion in such evidence. Strings of a vertical harp can only rarely be counted from the harp in a stone frieze. The nature and count of an ensemble cannot be read from a painted vase. The choreography and costume of an early dance cannot be reliably gleaned from bronze figurines. The functional voice of a vessel flute cannot be inferred from its shape and decora- tion program. But iconographie evidence is of vital importance as a piece to be weighed with other historiographie evidence, especially epi- graphic and literary. The value of ethnographic analogy was debated again and again. Ethnographic analysis alerts us to three important facts. First, music can be made from virtually anything, a stone, a stick, a pipe, a gourd. Many artifacts cannot be definitively identified as musical instruments. Second, there are numerous varieties of sound makers fabricated from non-durable materials that are not likely to be preserved. Archaeology provides the ceramic, bronze, bone, and, occa- sionally wooden, bamboo, reed, and string instruments for our study. Whole classes of instruments are likely lost. Third, playing tech- niques are so diverse and contribute so much to the nature of music produced, laboratory measurements of instruments reveal little about the sound in performance. Musical traditions are craft traditions, with skills and knowledge passed from master to disciple in sustained, intimate contact, and thus they manifest a high degree of continuity. Nonetheless, the reason- ableness of inferences about the past from eth- nographic studies of living cultures must be carefully weighed in terms of spatial and tempo- ral distance and what is known specifically about historical continuities and disruptions. In the final discussions, the study group committed itself to enhanced publications in music archaeology, including an upgrading of the bulletin Archaeologia Musicalis, compila- tion of a bibliography of members' works, and pursuit of new avenues to publish original research by members.
