First programme: DL: I think I am blessed or cursed with total recall and I recollect my very happy childhood in much detail. It was very happy until it was overtaken by events, namely the war, and then I came from Malaya to Singapore as a refugee and then to Ceylon and Sri Lanka and then to Durban with my mother and sister when I was 10. MF: And you wrote a very specific poem from that childhood experience. DL: Yes, one of the more piercing memories was about a flower. I think they may be quite common in several countries, they bloom just once per annum. This one is called "Flower for the Night." [Reads it] MF: How different did you feel to those other children on the South Coast when you first came to this country? DL: Well, I wasn't conscious of any difference really. I couldn't make head or tail of this strange language, Afrikaans, which a lot of the kids spoke in a sort of slang. But we were all just grubby small boys together. That was also a good time, South Coast of Natal. MF: And growing up, going to Kearsney College? DL: Well, hang on, I went to a couple of government schools first. Perhaps I should confess, both of which asked me leave.

DL: Yes, I went from Margate government school to Port Shepstone government school. And then, luckily my father came back from prisoner of war camp at the time things were getting uncomfortable at Port Shepstone and he packed me off to boarding school. MF: What did you do that they asked you to leave? DL: I don't know. I have never been very good at taking direction I guess. I also used to pin poems up on the school noticeboard that weren't too well received by the authorities. MF: Is this a conflict that you have had, as a thread, all through your life, running counter to the authorities and the accepted norms. DL: I have looked at this situation. I have come to accept it. It has been very difficult. I have been not much good, either as a follower or a leader. Some people have tried to put me in a leadership role, but I have not been much good at that. I am a bit better now, more mellow and fairly senior in a scientific establishment and part of a team. That's been good for me. MF: Flow much pressure have you felt to conform to the way everybody else is around you? DL: Monica, I have worked very, very hard to appear normal, to try to conform. It's not easy. MF: Why should it be such hard work? DL: I suppose there is an anarchic element in me, I suppose in most creative people. But there's an incredible tension between expression and the discipline that art autonomously demands for itself. We are getting a bit metaphysical here, and penetrating. So we'll just.... Better leave that one, I think. MF: We will come back to the metaphysical at a later stage because I think some of your poems have a decidedly metaphysical feel to them. But you mentioned an anarchic element to you and that as a young man you pushed yourself pretty close to the edge with some very physical, some very real</page><page sequence="3">INTERVIEW 1993 139 experiences such a lifesaving and diving and I believe you have even donned boxing gloves and rugby shorts. DL: I guess most young blokes do that sort of thing. I wasn't a particular star at anything. I did hold a world record for a very short time with scuba gear, self-contained underwater breathing apparatus. But nothing outstanding. MF: Your diving actually took you underwater for the construction of the Kariba Dam. What about reading for us "Spinal Column"? [DL reads it] MF: Does this, do you think, confuse your readers sometimes as to who you are and where you've been? Are poets meant to do all these tough, physical things? DL: I don't think they are tough. One's got a body and a brain and they are two machines or two parts making up a complex machine that I guess lives to the hilt. The poems come out of that. Nothing very conscious about it. Nothing very separate about it. I love scholarship. Sometimes in my scientific work I have to spend hours in libraries doing paper research. I love that. But I have had very few opportunities for it. My job is physical and cerebral and I am very pleased the poems are. I hope nobody is confused. [Reads "Vanderdecken"] MF: You've mentioned that it wasn't a seeking out of physical experience, but this is advice that you give to young poets or would-be poets that they need to go out there and live before they start to express their experiences. DL: Ah yes. But I tell them to take it further. I tell them to take up hang gliding or delayed drop parachuting or something, because those are less dangerous than attempting to write poetry. MF: You don't really mean that! DL: Yes I do. I do. This is the most terrifying, the most fearsome thing anyone can go in for. You risk your life literally. You risk your sanity, your health. Your peace - certainly your peace - is shattered. Very difficult for families to cope with. That is the edge, trying to write poems seriously. I get very alarmed when young people read a few poems and think, ah, easy art form, all I need is a pen, and this is going to be a piece of old cake - it's less work than novel writing and short stories. But really, when you go into it, it</page><page sequence="4">140 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE AND MONICA FAIRALL gets hold of you. I guess the main risks are to sanity and to peace and to personal relationships. MF: So you are saying when a poem has you in its jaws it doesn't let go. DL: Yes, you have got to exorcise it to remain sane. [Reads "Road Back"] DL: I have been enchanted by words as long as I can remember. I remember reading aged three, trying to make up poems aged four or five. I have always been totally enchanted by words. Of course this is regarded with grave suspicion by one's urchin peers and you learn to try and hide it there and develop a line of witty repartee and vulgarity of speech, constant jokes, the clown mask, etc. I have always played with words and have written some pretty filthy poems too while I was experimenting. It was only after a series of illnesses in Zambia, Northern Rhodesia, that I started trying to tackle the thing as a great vast unconquered terrain. MF: Was the conflict between your work, the science and the poetry already evident then. DL: I keep getting this question. I see no conflict in science and art. I look upon science as man's search for the truth and art as man's interpretation of the truth. They are two sides of one single coin and I don't find any difficulty in balancing the two at all. No, the main trouble is the solitary, monastic, selfish commitment to getting the words right, and the rewriting, to the exclusion of everything - people, food, sleep. That's the danger, I think. And one has to keep one's body reasonably fit to cope with this because the cerebral demands are intense. And it's often to no or very small effect. The successes, the rewards, are just about nil. MF: You believe that people don't read poetry? DL: Most people are put off poetry in childhood, insensitive school teachers and so on. If it was handled differently, perhaps not as a compulsory subject but as an entertainment subject, a wordplay subject, I think a lot more people would read it. Certainly, nothing empties a room faster than the word poetry. [Reads "One Elephant"] DL: You can get so much from poetry. You can get more from good poems than you can from any psychiatrist. So much has gone into them, so much human experience, both the joy and the agony. It's a great pity we teach it</page><page sequence="5">INTERVIEW 1993 141 wrong. It's our Kleenex age - age of throwaway art, pop music, so on. There are other countries that revere poetry and love it. Blokes like Yevtushenko could fill a huge auditorium, much like a pop singer could. But then I don't know. Poetry starts getting pop - Patience Strong is the world's best-seller poet. Followed closely by Rod McKuen. I think that says a lot about popular culture. It's probably just as well that it's a solitary craft, solitary art, and probably requires a solitary reader. I don't know. MF: If you believe that not many people write [i.e. read] poetry, who do you write for? DL: I have an imaginary audience of one, who is an amalgam of several people. Witty, erudite, ironic and sympathetic, needing some form of cerebral entertainment I guess. I tend to write for this person. They are probably all over, such people. The trouble is getting them and the poems together. Not just my poems. There are plenty of fine poems around. [Reads "The Ossuary"] MF: You referred earlier to illnesses that you had experienced as a young man. Would you like to comment on the effect that these had on you and perhaps on your creative life subsequently? DL: I think it was T. S. Eliot that said that if the poetry was in you and you denied it, you got sick, which is a wonderfully romantic idea. My problem was I was in the laboratory side of diagnostic medicine and my immune system hadn't been challenged and I tended to pick up everything at the lab. I think that's the more likely explanation for my turning to poetry seriously, I think the long spells of introspection. You know - pericarditis, I was flat on my back for six months, then all the sequels - meningitis, septicaemia, all that stuff. And then when I was doing TB research, culturing TB in the lab, probably being a bit careless, I got TB kidneys. I think that was more or less the climax. My immune system is now strong. I am full of rude health. The TB was a problem because it was a long-drawn-out treatment and the drugs affected my cerebral health. So seriously that I was diagnosed as having a very marked bipolar illness and I was sent down to a mental setup, I suppose one would call it an asylum, in Bulawayo, where they proceeded to treat me for this chemically induced mental aberration. Yes, I have a poem about it. MF: That's "Reflections at Sunkist"?</page><page sequence="6">142 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE AND MONICA FAIRALL DL: Yes. It's one of the beach sampling poems. The first and last stanzas are.... the first stanza triggers the poem because of a reflection of a piece of broken mirror, rubbish on the beach. [Reads "Reflections at Sunkist," then reads "The Explainer"] MF: Douglas, how thin a skin do you think you need to have in order to be a poet? DL: Again, paradox, conflict. You should have a skin so fine that you feel everything - the gentle zephyrs, the echo effects behind the most casual remarks, the total immersion in whatever you are looking at. Then, of course you can't live like that, so you need a thin skin to write poems and you've got to make it as thick as the rhino hide in order to survive. MF: Where does the mask of the clown come in? DL: This is a very tempting and convenient one. I love to make people laugh. It's a great therapy. I like laughter. MF: And you have a very useful persona that you use, Giovanni Jacopo. I think he covers for a very mischievous side to your personality, Douglas. DL: Yes, he's very serious. These are translations from the Latin, this bundle of ancient Latin poems that came into my clutches that I've translated and updated a bit. He's a reprobate. He's no good at all. He's thoroughly disreputable. And he entertains people. MF: Was Giovanni always available to you, or did he emerge later in your writing career? DL: Giovanni was probably the bloke who pinned the poems on the board at Port Shepstone government school. A youthful Giovanni. MF: Let's have some Giovanni now. DL: This one is a poem called "Street of Professions" from a series "Tales from the Tower of Babel," which is culled from old Sumerian tablets at Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh was of course much more serious than Giovanni's treatment of it. [Reads it] MF: One of your recent Giovanni poems shows a cynicism and scepticism about office technology. [DL reads "Giovanni Jacopo Meditates (on 'Scientists Discover Black Hole')"]</page><page sequence="7">INTERVIEW 1993 143 Second programme: MF: Douglas, how much do you think a poet is able to change things, people, the world, politics? DL: Well, you have touched on something here. This is a great mystery. There is possibly in poetry a missionary zeal. It doesn't work as a nakedly political poem - as I think the poet hopes it would work. I think poets above all try to change themselves and possibly - this may be terribly egotistic - possibly enhance one's own and the sensibilities immediately around one. I don't think there is any hope at all of changing a country or a political party's direction through a poem or a series of poems. One could sensitise people. But then, I don't know about you, but as soon as I get preached to I sort of clam up or I start looking for opposing ground. Preachers, poetic preachers, they are rather like censors, they assume they know what is good for me. It's a tricky terrain this. And of course, possibly apart from one young man in this country I don't know any politicians that are good poets, and vice versa. [Reads "The Metallic Aviator"] DL: If I were a black poet I would have a hard time not writing what we call protest poetry. Protest poetry gets dated swiftly. Its only virtue is to advertise the political rectitude, political correctness of the poet. I find most of them very boring. But I can see how if one is caught up in a situation of chanting one's rather limp propagandistic lines to a crowd of people who are cheering you on, I can see that can go to the poet's head and he will say, well this is the path to the holy grail of poetry. I loathe politics, really I do. Although they are intrinsic to life, they seem to bring out all the worst in a man. I don't care who is in charge, I mistrust them. I feel - and I hate to say this - that a lot of the political poetry we have been exposed to has been a waste, a waste at the time because it didn't change things at all. Some may claim the contrary. For politics you go to newspapers and newspapers get dated very quickly. And what happens when all the politics change, what happens to that great body of work of yours that you wrote in the fond belief that you were changing the world? All you can rescue from it is maybe a couple of good lines, a couple of good images. These long, boring, repetitive poems I find, in a strange way, that they are anti the art or craft of poetry. They have widened the definition of poetry into areas I cannot follow. This is a poem I wrote in 1982, it's an amalgam really of all the major black poets that I know and love, particularly one of them. It is called "The Wasteland at Station at 14." [Reads it]</page><page sequence="8">144 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE AND MONICA FAIRALL MF: I have a sense that you'd like to see change taking place in a more subtle way. DL: Change has got to come from within. You take the present sort of genuflection to the idols of non-racism. Then you walk into a pub or a squatters' camp, people will say one thing with their mouths and there is something else going on in the heads. It would be better, as I say, to change one from the inside out, instead of the present style of trying to change from the outside in. I don't think you can change people from the outside in. That sums up my reservations about political poetry. MF: There's a very evocative image of planting a seed that you use in a poem that you dedicated to Lionel Abrahams. DL: Ah yes, Lionel. Wonderful brain, and a wonderful sense of humour. He has given much of his life to encouraging young writers. He's been connected with a number of journals, most notably The Purple Renoster, and most recently Sesame. [Reads "The Sower and the Seed"] MF: One wonders where, let's call them, the protest poets of the last twenty years are going to turn now for their subject matter, for their inspiration. DL: To women, and the sea, and the moon, and Africa, and the animals, and their friends, and living. To me it's just obvious. MF: Let's look at a poem that celebrates some of the joys of living, "Drinking Wine." [DL reads it] DL: I am more alive here than anywhere else. I am very attached to Africa and the people here. I was recently in Italy. Wonderful quality of light there. Great people. And a tired and over civilized landscape where you can never get away from a dwelling place. The villages run into towns into the cities and out again. The pavements are crowded, the trains are crowded, everything is crowded. We only experience that in our concrete jungles. You can get away in Africa, can enjoy some solitude of the soul, just using your feet. What we have got here, in the way of natural fauna and flora, is an incredible treasure. Maybe we could give up some of our 'quality of life,' those of us that have it, to probably share a bit more with the ones that don't have that quality of life, but not to take it up to northern hemisphere standards. Just try and hang on to the good earth, this great mother that we live on here.</page><page sequence="9">INTERVIEW 1993 145 MF: Let's have another poem from A Littoral Zone, "Eland at Station 17." [DL reads it] MF: You range very widely in terms of subject matter. But perhaps you were first known for your animal poems. They are particularly powerful and very heavily anthologised. What was it that drew you to so many wild animals as your subject matter? DL: This beautiful, harsh continent is so richly blessed with these animals. I love them. By celebrating them perhaps we can preserve them a little. There's just a magnificence about animals. They are to be enjoyed in solitude. We have elements of them in us. They have a purity despite what appears to us as cruelty. There are extant a lot of animal poems but most of them are a trifle, shall we say, sentimental. A lot of them are anthropocentric or anthropomorphic. I don't know, I just have an affinity for animals. MF: And this beautiful harsh continent, one senses that is a huge inspiration for you as well. DL: Yes. It's magnificent, it's malevolent. To me it's a cradle of life. As an African, as a white African, I love it. MF: Let's hear "Lake Morning in Autumn." [Reads it] MF: How much of you is there in "Zoo Affair"? DL: I love cats from the domestic up to the big ones. But this was a true happening. There used to be a zoo at Toti. A chap was found in there one morning, got me thinking, and there is a lot of me in all the poems. There has to be, otherwise they are false poems, aren't they? Is there such a thing as a false poem? I don't know. I see that there was very recently - this year - I read a press report of a bloke doing exactly the same thing in one of the zoos in the UK. I got a flash of guilt. I hoped he hadn't read the poem and been influenced by it. I can understand this. I think anyone can understand it. The title "Zoo Affair" is important. It is a metaphor for many love affairs, I think. MF: Is the first stanza about suicide? DL: Yes, yes it is. [Reads "Zoo Affair"]</page><page sequence="10">146 DOUGLAS LIVINGSTONE AND MONICA FAIRALL MF: What is it about the cats that speaks to you so much? DL: Their grace, their unfathomableness, their almost humour. I find them very -1 don't know if this is politically correct -1 find them very female. MF: Now you have got a poem about a domestic cat and I think he is decidedly male. DL: Ah yes. I think this is a fairly common experience, moving house and one of the family pets doesn't like the move. It's called "Cowboy Come Home." [Reads it] MF: Moving back into your animal poems in general. You write in this arena very toughly and honestly and uncompromisingly. I am thinking something like where you write about the loggerhead turtle in "Bad Run at King's Rest," where you talk about what people do to animals. DL: Yes, this does happen. I suppose it's ignorance on the part of the people. People are okay one at a time. It's when they get into mobs that strange things happen to them. [Reads "Bad Run at King's Rest"] DL: If we're the acme of creation, God help creation. I think what we do to each other on a global, on a national, on a political, even on a domestic scale, is not too good mostly. I don't take too sanguine a view of homo sap. MF: What does this hold out for the future of the planet? I am asking the poet and the scientist. DL: Well, to make a fashionable remark, we have got to curb pollution. But there is really only one kind of pollution and that's called people pollution. I think we had better start limiting our numbers consciously and morally because in a way that is what we are doing, unconsciously and immorally, fouling our nest, this lovely planet. I think the planet will fight back. Not consciously. It's a living cell and cells are not conscious. But they have various strategies - retreat or attack. And of course the planet can't retreat from man. It may do it more subtly of course, it may change its atmosphere to make life difficult for us. I don't take too happy a view of the future I must say. Because we are overrunning our heritage. We are screwing things up for future generations. As a species we are out of hand. What little I know about nature, nature does not tolerate that sort of thing for too long. Sorry, being a bit gloomy here.</page><page sequence="11">INTERVIEW 1993 147 MF: Your poems are not all gloom, there's a wonderful one about a triumphant bantam that survives the floods, also in your A Littoral Zone collection. DL: Yes, after the '87 floods when it seemed that half Africa was beached along the sands off Durban I had to go down and sample and there was this continuous mountain of debris, a lot of death around. This was the morning after and the sea was all calm and smiling. There was this wonderful sight of this bedraggled and angry bantam on the highest point of the driftwood. This poem's called "Scourings at Station 19." This is one of my sampling stations just north of the Umkomaas. [Reads it] [This two-part interview was aired on SABC in June 1993 and has been transcribed by Mariss Stevens at NELM. It is published here with the permission of the SABC.]</page></plain_text>
