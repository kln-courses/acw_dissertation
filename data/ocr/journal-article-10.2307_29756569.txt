<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gulzar Muhammad Khan, Excavations at Zarif Karuna {Pakistan Archaeology, Num? ber 9, 1973, Karachi 1979). The author refers to the discovery and excavation (1971) of the graveyard of Zarif Karuna, in the Peshawar plain. During the campaign, carried out by the Department 184</page><page sequence="2">of Archaeology of the Government of Pa? kistan, 32 graves were excavated and the furnishings of another 12 disturbed graves were salvaged. According to the stratigraphical evidence, the graves have been reported to three subsequent periods characterized by different burial customs. The complex includes: one grave with a flexed inhumated body, ascribed to Period I; 17 graves with urn burials containing cremated bones, ascribed to Pe? riod II; 14 graves with fractional or mul? tiple burials, ascribed to Period III. On the basis of the typological features of the grave furnishings, consisting mostly of va? ses, the whole complex has been attributed to the "Gandhara Grave Culture". The discovery ? as the author rightly re? marks ? is of great importance because it shows the presence, in the Peshawar plain, of some cultural traits mostly re? corded in the northern hilly area of the North-West Frontier Province. In fact the grave furnishing from Zarif Karuna show some close links with shapes of pottery and with objects common in the protohistorical graves of Sw?t and Panjkora valleys (C. Silvi Antonini - G. Stacul, The Protohistoric Graveyards of Sw?t {Pakistan), IsMEO, Rome 1972; A. H. Dani (ed.), Timargarha and Gandhara Grave Culture, Ancient Pa? kistan, III, 1967). In this regard Gulzar properly stresses the wide diffusion, from Sw?t and Dir to the Peshawar plain, of some types of vases as the anthropomorphic jars (fig. 8, PI. XV, PL XVI A), the globular and the carinated goblets, as well as a type of female round-shaped figurine (PI. XVII A). In any case there are some other features which distinguish the grave fur? nishings from Zarif Karuna, such as the particular shape of the visage-urns (fig. 8/23, PI. XVI A/1), the occurrence of clay figu? rines representing the humped-bull (PI. XVII B, PI. XVIII A) and the frequent presence of small gold objects (PI. XX B). Of special interest is a stone "eye-goddess", compared by Gulzar with specimens from Tell Brack in Mesopotamia (PI. XVIII B, PI. XIX A). On the basis of the typological affinities, the whole assemblage from Zarif Karuna may be mostly compared with vases and objects common in the Sw?t Valley during Period V (c. 1400/1300-800 BC), when flexed inhumation, cremation and fractional burials were contemporarily in use. The occurrence in all the periods of Zarif Karuna of the same very common type of vase (see Table 1), as well as the presence of various types of vases with disk-base (see PI. XIV) and the absence of iron objects may support this assumption. Considering the comparatively few graves as yet excavated (only one grave represents Period I), it seems too early as yet to give meaning to the above-mentioned chronolo? gical differences of burial custom. In this connection we have also to notice that the graves of Period III which appear on the illustrations (Pis. VII C, VIII D, IX A, XI B), rather than "fractional burials" they seem to give us evidence of disturbed inhumation burials. This suggestion is sup? ported by the occurrence in the Sw?t Valley of some cases of fractional burial where the bones have been carefully collected with the skull placed on top according to a well defined ritual (G. Stacul, The Fractional Burial Custom in the Sw?t Valley and Some Connected Problems, EW, 25, 1975, pp. 323 332). To sum up, we again stress the great importance of this discovery, which extends up the Kabul River some cultural traits previously recorded in graves and settlements of the northern hilly area. The close affi? nities between some pottery types from the protohistorical graveyards of the Sw?t Val? ley on one hand and the "soapy red ware" recovered by Sir Mortimer Wheeler in the deepest levels of Ch?rsada on the other (M. Wheeler, Ch?rsada, a Metropolis of the North-West Frontier, London 1962), suggested to us, years ago, the large diffusion of similar cultural features. The present report on Zarif Karuna, as well as a sub? sequent very important discovery made by the Department of Archaeology of Pakistan near Taxila, allows us to connect some 185</page><page sequence="3">cultural horizons of the Sw?t Valley and other surrounding regions with that of the peoples who lived in the great alluvial plains.
