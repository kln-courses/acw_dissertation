<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cambridge Opera Journal, 15, 2, 107 ( 2003 Cambridge University Press Editors' Note It is with great pleasure, and some trepidation, that we introduce ourselves as the new editors of the Journal. Part of the pleasure is in thanking Mary Hunter for her leadership over the last five years. To take over from her and then, at one remove, from Arthur Groos and Roger Parker, is of course a challenge. After fifteen years of adventurous and imaginative writing on opera, the Journal has developed an identity very much its own, one with which we are very pleased to be associated. Such anthropomorphic fantasies aside, we both feel a more intimate affection for the enterprise - as a place in which we looked first for lively new work on opera when we were graduate students, and as a venue in which we were both lucky enough to publish some of our earliest work. The Journal's personality is now strong enough that statements of intellectual vision might sound foolhardy or at least redundant. All the signs indicate that opera studies continue to be just as vibrant as they were ten or fifteen years ago, despite important reorientations in the field of musicology generally. Our first hope, then, is to sustain the tradition of creative thought in which the Journal has excelled for so long. At the same time, some stirrings of new approaches, and even of new definitions of opera as a genre, can be detected within the covers of this, our first issue, and in our plans for the future. The current issue gestures toward both performance analysis and a broadening of what "opera" might mean. Richard Taruskin's meditation on contemporary sacred works begins from responses to recent productions of John Adams' cantata El Niio and Messiaen's Saint Franfois d'Assise, and Barry Emslie proposes an approach to Handel based on hearing his operas as volatile, ever-changing performance events. In her study of Schumann's not-quite- opera Manfred, Laura Tunbridge maps the neglected territory between nineteenth- century German opera and programme music, probing the simultaneous fascination with and suspicion of the theatrical so characteristic of German composers before Wagner. Future issues will pursue many such avenues. A special issue in 2004 will be devoted to intersections between opera studies and performance studies, and other articles due for publication in the near future will stretch the boundaries in other directions - into the musicals of Stephen Sondheim, the innovations of the Florentine intermedi and the genre-bending experiments of Josephine Baker in 1930s Paris. Opera as an art form is famously adaptable, and is becoming even more so as contemporary productions engage with new media and the tastes and expectations of new audiences. Cambridge Opera Journal has always been a lively scholarly reflection of the variety of opera itself; we hope to maintain this spirit of enquiry and innovation.
