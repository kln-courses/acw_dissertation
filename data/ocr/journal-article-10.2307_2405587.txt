SCHMIDT University of Chicago 2 Received November 6, 1954 INTRODUCTION The relative non-existence of ethological fossils (with such exceptions as fossil tracks and burrows) and the transitory nature of movements and behavior pat- terns makes the study of the evolution of behavior extremely difficult. It is not surprising that the number of papers deal- ing with this subject is so small compared to the vast literature on the evolution of morphological structure. The nests of the African genus of ter- mites, Apicotermes, present unique mate- rial for the study of the evolution of be- havior. These species-specific structures are tangible products of the nest-building behavior of the entire colony, and permit an ethological study of a supraorganism in contrast to an organism. They are rela- tively permanent and may be studied in the laboratory at leisure. The known nests present an unusually complete phy- logenetic series, and it can be expected that this series will be considerably im- proved as future collections fill in exist- ing gaps. In this genus, the nests show phylogenetic relationships much more clearly than do the morphological char- acteristics of their builders. Emerson (1938) summarizes the attributes of ter- mite nests as follows: "Termite nests may be used as examples of behavior evolution because they are mnorpho- logical indications of behavior patterns, they express the behavior of a population, the pat- terns are hereditary, there is a natural control over any Lamarckian influence, evolutionary sequences are available, adaptive modifications may be demonstrated, and coordination mecha- nisms may be partially analyzed." Of the many types of structures (nests, webs, cases, etc.) produced by various organisms, the nests of termites present one of the best materials for the study of the evolution of behavior, and the nests of Apicotermes are far superior in certain respects to the nests of other termites. In Apicotermes, the nest of each species is unusually characteristic of that species in contrast to the nests of many of the other termites which often vary conspicuously only between genera. Such a complete phylogenetic series of so many species within a single genus is also rare among termites. This type of study will probably be criticized by some, who will point out that a description of the nest does not describe the actions or processes performed in building the nest. This cannot be denied. However, it must be emphasized that this paper deals not with a description of the nest-building behavior but with the evolu- tion of this behavior. There can be little doubt that the nests of Apicotermes are valid indicators of the phylogenetic rela- tionships of the behavior producing them. The known nests of Apicotermes have been described in detail by Desneux (1918, 1948, and 1953) and the termites themselves by Emerson (1953). Both of these workers have discussed the phy- logeny of the genus (Emerson, 1952a, 1953 and Desneux, 1948, 1953). This paper, leaning heavily upon the work of these two men, will attempt to deal with the phylogeny of the genus in greater de- tail, using additional data as well as oc- 1'A dissertation submitted to the Department of Zoology, University of Chicago, in partial fulfillment of the degree of Doctor of Philos- ophy. 2 Present address is Dept. of Biol.

Certain aspects of the evolution of these nests will then be discussed. METHODS Sources and Types of Material Measurements were taken from three sources. The only nests available for study were some fragments in the custody of Dr. A. E. Emerson at the University of Chicago. These nests were received from the Musee Royal du Congo Belge, T. E. Snyder, Professor P.-P. Grasse, and Dr. J. Desneux. This collection was especially useful in that it provided the most accurate set of measuremnents made. Extensive use was made of photographs in the 1948 and especially the 1953 papers of Dr. J. Desneux. Radiographs were made of the nest walls of the specimens in Emerson's collection. Radiographs of Nest Walls Radiographs were obtained by merely laying the nest fragment on a piece of film and irradiating from above. The film was kept small to reduce errors resulting from the curvature of the nest. The nest and film were exposed at about one meter from the target in order to reduce errors due to divergence of rays. Kodak Super Ortho-Press was wrapped in black paper and used as film. The results were rea- sonably satisfactory, although use of bet- ter materials and techniques might pos- sibly have given somewhat better resolu- tion of certain wall structures. The best resolution was obtained at about 30-50 kv., depending upon the nest fragment used. A few of the more interesting radiographs are shown in figure 5. Methods of Measuring The size and accessibility of the struc- ture determined the method by which it was measured. Nest structures smaller than 1 cm. were generally measured by an ocular micrometer in a dissecting micro- scope. Mleasurements of less than 1 cm. fromi photographs were usually 1made with fine-pointed calipers, the distance between the points of the calipers being determnined by placing them against an ocular micromn- eter with a 1 cm. scale. Measurements greater than 1 cm. were mnade with calipers and a mietal rule calibrated in millimeters. Areas were measured with a planimeter. In a few cases the area was too smiall to be measured directly by this 1method. The area was then enlarged with a microscope and camiera lucida and the enlarged area determnined with a planimeter. Accuracy of Measurements A number of sources of error are in- herent to the methods used in this study. An extensively used character is the length of the internal slit. These are internal openings of conduits that pass through the nest wall. Errors in the measurement of these slits result from the difficulty in actually defining the struc- ture. Slits are often closed to varying degrees with sand or mortar, making it very difficult to determine the exact limits of the structures. Because of this, dif- ferent observers might obtain slightly dif- ferent mieasurements due to different con- cepts of slit limits. However, several checks used indicate that the measure- ments of these structures are somewhat more accurate than one would suspect from the difficulty just mentioned. Slits measured from radiographs (fig. 5) gave results simiilar to those obtained directly from the nest. Measurements of a small number of slits, the conduits of which had been sectioned horizontally (fig. 3) also provided a good check. Such horizontal sections through the conduits exposed the slit free from obstructing miaterial, thus providing the most accurate measurement of this structure. Although this is the obvious solution to the difficulty of slit measurement, it is not practicable at pres- ent. This method would require the al- most complete destruction of the portion of nest being used, which would, of course, be inadvisable with such rare material.</page><page sequence="3">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERMES 159 The use of photographs of curved struc- tures also introduces errors that are dif- ficult to avoid. So far as possible, only those portions of a photograph were used in which the object photographed was in focus and in a plane parallel to the plane of the film. Even so, much of the varia- bility of data from photographs is un- doubtedly due to such factors as curva- ture. It would be expected that the distance between centers of external parietal open- ings would be slightly greater than the distance between the centers of the cor- responding internal parietal openings of the same nest because of the radial ar- rangement of these structures. It will be noted in table 1 that this is not always the case. This is because the two sets of measurements were often made from dif- ferent photographs or nest fragments. Some of the larger samples of measure- ments of the length of the internal slit, interval between slits, and distance be- tween centers of external pores were checked to see if they fitted the normal curve. It was found that they fitted rea- sonably well. Choice and Arrangement of Data Both the vertical and horizontal curva- ture of the nest vary along its vertical axis. This usually results in the wall structures of the two poles being some- what different from the rest of the nest. Since the poles were generally not avail- able for study, measurements have been restricted to the equatorial, central por- tions of the nest wall. It also seemed advisable to exclude portions obviously modified by such factors as the presence of an adjacent ramp or a root passing through the wall. Only the most ac- curate data obtained have been presented in table 1. Data have been excluded for which the accuracy was for some reason questionable (e.g., due to excessive curva- ture or unknown magnification in the case of a published photograph). When sufficient data have been available di- rectly from a nest fragmient, these have been given preference over data obtained from photographs. Table 1 has been arranged according to locality and species. Since the variability within species has not received adequate taxonomic evaluation, it did not seem advisable to lump all data for a single "species." Therefore local populations, in many cases probably single colonies, have been dealt with separately. Highly accurate nest measurements and large samples will not be possible until nests may be spared for dissection and more extensive collections are available. GENERAL NEST CHARACTERISTICS AND TERMINOLOGY Apicotermes belongs to the Term-itidae, the most advanced family of termites and is one of the more prinlitive genera in the subfamily Termitinae (Ahmad, 1950). Most of the closely related genera are subterranean, but unfortunately their nests are unknown. Eventual collection of their nests should add much important informiation about the origin of Apico- termes. Only sufficient description of nests need be given here to permit discussion of nest phylogeny. The reader is referred to the papers by Desneux (especially his 1953 paper) for detailed description and photo- graphs. The shape of the nest varies with the species, but is more or less oval, some- what similar to an American football. The height varies from about 4 to 42 centimeters. These subterranean nests are usually found in sandy soil in rain- forests, although two species with known nests inhabit savanna. Nests have been found at depths -up to 60 centimeters. A single colony probably consists of several nests connected by tunnels. The external surface of the nest shows a porous covering composed of grains of sand and having the appearance of foam rubber.

A Comitparisont of Nest Measurements from Different Species and Localities network. Several types of this network are found. Excrement, saliva, and extraneous ma- terial such as sand, dirt, and wood par- ticles are used by various termites in their constructions (Emerson, 1938). The bulk of the nest material in Apicotermtes is composed of excrement (Grasse and Noirot, 1948b) although the shagreen network seems to be built largely of grains of sand. A vertical section through the nest shows it to consist of a number of hori- zontal, parallel stories separated by thin lamellac (fig. 1). Each lamella is from 0.5 to 1.5 mm. thick, depending upon the</page><page sequence="5">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERMES 161 species. The distance between the centers of adjacent lamellae is from 6 to 10 milli- meters. Communication between the different floors is made possible by ramps. These are of two types-direct and helicoidal (Desneux, 1953). The former permits a more or less direct course by termites moving between floors, while the latter imposes a spiral course, necessitating an alternation from one side of the ramp to the other as the termite moves along. The most characteristic feature of this genus is seen in the various systems of perforation of the nest wall, permitting the exchange of gases between the interior and exterior of the nest. Only one species lacks such a system, having lost it sec- ondarily. The particular type of perfora- tion is characteristic of the species (figs: 1, 2, and 5 ). In most species internal parietal openings are found which are small, discrete, horizontal slits. These average between 2.5 and 5.5 mm. in length, depending upon the species. These slits are the internal openings of conduits that run directly to the outside through projections, pass into long funnels, or open into circular galleries. The circular gallery is a horizontal tube enclosed within the nest wall and continuous around the entire circunmference of the nest. The small size of the internal parietal openings prohibit their use as passages into the galleries or to the outside of the nest. With the exception of the nests of A. "occttltus," the circular galleries open to the exterior through small external pores. In those nests with discrete internal slits the portion of the wall between slits usually protrudes slightly toward the center of the nest to form a pilaster. In some nests, the conduits are lined with a special material differing in comn- position fromn the rest of the nest. A PHYLOGENY OF NESTS The phylogeny given here is based largely on nest structures. Only two species of Apicotermes, A. trdgardi and a new species from Nyasaland, are with- out known nests. On the other hand, a number of nests have been described for which no inhabitants have as yet been collected. These are usually referred to A gqurgullfex A. desnex A. kisGnfuensls A. angus/a/us A. porifex Bas Congo A. Iamani A. arquieri A. 'bcculfus" FIG. 1. Diagram of vertical sections through nest walls.

A key to nests, based on the phylogeny of the genus as given here, is included to emphasize phy- logenetic relationships. The phylogeny may be most conveniently discussed by dividing the genus into three groups: the "occultus" group (left branch of figure 4) the porifex group (right branch of figure 4 exclusive of the Bas Congo nest), and the Bas Congo nest. The "occultus" Group This is a group of three species in- dicated on the left side of figure 4. These show a number of distinct differences from the remaining members of the genus. Unfortunately, as complete a phylogenetic series is not available here as in the porifex group. At present it is not possible to say whether this is due to extinction of the intervening species or to failure, as yet, to collect these species. The A. "occultus" nests are only as- sumed to belong to that species on the basis of locality, the termites never having been collected together with the nest. The nests of this group are found in the soil surrounded by a space (the orien- tation of A. "occultus" has not yet been observed). This is in contrast to species of the other groups whose nests are sur- rounded by an envelope of sand. The shagreen network is another char- acter distinguishing the "occultus" group. Here the shagreen layer is a much more intimate part of the wall than in other nests, and will not chip off cleanly. This layer forms a uniform covering of the external surface of the nest. The distance between floors is generally greater than in other groups (table 1). The internal parietal openings of this group (when they occur) pierce the wall near the bottom of a story, i.e., less than half-way from the floor to the ceiling (fig. 1). The distinctness of this group is further verified by the taxonomic studies of Emer- son (1953). He finds that the post- mentum of both A. lamani and A. arquieri is constricted at the center, while the post- mentum of members of the porifex group has parallel sides. The species name A. arquieri is based upon data furnished by Pierre-P. Grasse and Charles Noirot and should be ascribed to these authors.

A few stages of hypothetical gallery ontogenies suggesting a recapitulation of certain phylogenetic stages. Labeled stages are found in known nests.</page><page sequence="7">NEST-BUILDING IN APICO TERMES 163 The "occultus" group is subdivided by a number of distinct features. A. arquieri and A. "occultus" are closely related as shown by the ramps of their nests. In all other nests the ramps are direct, i.e., the termites can pass along them in a more or less direct course. However, here the ramps are helicoidal, requiring a twisting course by the termite using them. The unique helicoidal ramps of this pair are concentrated largely in the central axis of the nest, in contrast to the more scattered arrangement of the direct ramps in other species. As indicated in table 1, A. arquieri and A. "occultus" are the only species studied with floor thicknesses as great or greater than 1 millimeter. Circular galleries are present in both A. arquieri and A. "occultus" nests. In. the latter species the galleries are com- pletely isolated, their internal and ex- ternal openings apparently having been lost through regressive evolution (fig. 1). 'These galleries often end blindly, rather than continuing around the entire cir- cumference of the nest. The conduit from the internal parietal opening to the gallery is continuous throughout the entire circumference in the nests of A. arquieri. The conduits of all other species consist of discrete, separate units (fig. 5). These continuous con- duits probably arose phylogenetically through the lateral fusion of discrete con- duits. This probably took place after the origin of galleries, because of the lack of wall support given by continuous conduits alone. Desneux (1953) also notes that pilasters are found in some of the lower portions of A. arqmieri nests. These are apparently similar to the pilasters found -between discrete slits, except that here the internal slit continues past the distal side of the pilaster. As noted by Desneux (1953), the rela- tion of the wall structures in A. arquieri is radically different from that of other nests with circular galleries (fig. 1). The gallery is opposite the ceiling of the story -from which its internal slit originates. In other species the gallery is opposite the floor of the story from which the internal slit opens. This difference is also shown by comparison, between different species, of a lamella plus attached wall structures. It is seen that in the porifex group the galleries are formed by a downward pro- jection of the upper lip of the external openings of the conduits. In A. arquieri this part of the wall structure sweeps upward. A. arquieri is the only known species showing meridional galleries, running ver- tically within the nest wall (fig. 5). In the nests of A. lamnani, discrete in- ternal parietal slits open to the exterior through long funnels (figs. 1 and 5), and the ramps are direct and scattered. These characteristics distinctly separate this spe- cies froiri the other two members of this group. The presence of internal slits and direct ramps suggests that A. lamnani is primitive, having arisen soon after the divergence of the "occultus" and porifex groups. The interval between slits con- siderably exceeds the length of the slits (table 1). Desneux (1948, 1953) shows a nest (from Zobe) similar to A. lainani in all respects except for the internal parietal openings. These are pores in this par- ticular nest, rather than slits. Desneux suggests that this difference may be the result of weathering of the nest fragment, part of the lining material around the slits having been eroded away, leaving only pores. Table 1 shows that the few meas- uremiients that could be made from this photograph fairly closely correspond to other A. lamnani specimens. The position of A. latani given here differs only slightly from that of Des- neux's (1953) phylogeny. He derives this nest from the base of the porifex group because of the direct ramps and discrete slits. Two other termites (without known nests), A. trdga'rdhi and a new species from Nyasaland, share with the "oc- cultus" group the characteristic of a con- stricted postmentum (Emerson, 1953 and</page><page sequence="8">164 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT personal communtlication). These species would probably fall somewhere below A. lamani in the phylogeny presented here. Emerson (1953) considers A. trdgadrdhi to be the most primitive of the known species of Apicotermes. The porifex Group This group is composed of a remlark- ably complete phylogenetic series as shown by the evolution of the circular galleries and the gradual modification of the con- duits. Emerson (1953) shows, from the study of the termites, that the 1iembers of this group are closely related, but states that their morphological character- istics do not permit one to be certain of their phylogenetic order. This order is much more clearly shown by the nests. All nests of this group that have been observed in their natural relation to the soil have been found to be surrounded by an envelope of sand, rather than by a space as in the preceeding group. The shagreen network resembles in many ways that of the "occultus" group, but differs in two important respects. Instead of being tightly bound to the nest wall, it is very loosely applied and may be easily chipped away, making a clean, abrupt break with the nest wall. This network is thinly scattered over the external sur- face, rather than forming a uniform cover- ing. The internal parietal openings generally pierce the wall higher than half-way frolm the floor to the ceiling (fig. 1). The ramps are always direct and scattered. The distance between the centers of ad- jacent lamellae is less than in the "oc- cultus" group and the floor thickness is less than in the arquieri-"occultus" pair. The porifex group is characterized by discrete internal parietal openings, whose length varies from about 2.7 mm. to 3.9 mm. (table 1), averaging about 3 milli- meters. The postmenta of all members of this group that have been studied have parallel sides (Emerson 1953 and per- sonal communication). A. gurgulifex to A. porifex series: The evolution of circular galleries can be seen in the series beginning with A. gurgulifex and ending with A. k-isantuensis (figs. 1 and 2). The species name A. gurgulifex is based upon data furnished by Alfred E. Emerson and should be ascribed to this author. The nest of A. gurgulifex has been described by Desneux and was previ-- ously referred to as the nest from Kisantu due to the absence of known inhabitants prior to a recent discovery of associated termites. In the nests of this species, the wall is perforated directly by hori- zontal conduits beginninlg with internal parietal slits and opening to the exterior through projections called gargoyles by Desneux. The nest of A. desneuxi shows a beginning of gallery development. This nest is similar to that of A. gurgulifex, with the exception of the downward pro- jection of the upper lip of the external opening of the conduit to form a hood. The distal ends of these hoods approach but do not fuse with the nest wall. Al- though the nests of A. gurgulifex and A. desneuxi differ considerably, the soldier termites differ only slightly in structure (Emerson, personal communication). A nest from Mayidi, for which the termites are unknown may illustrate the next step in the evolution of circular galleries. Here the distal ends of the hoods often fuse with the wall of the nest forming, at places, galleries completely enclosed ex- cept for openings that remain between the hoods. The circular gallery is finally completed in the nests of A. kisantuensis, becoming entirely enclosed except for small external pores. The species fol- lowing A. kisantuensis in this group, A. angustatus and A. porifex, also have com- plete circular galleries. Table 1 gives a rough measurement of this progressive closing-in of the gal- leries. These figures were obtained by dividing the area of the outside of the nest (below the internal slits and not en- closed by projecting upper lips of the external conduit openings) by the total area. The figure thus obtained gradually</page><page sequence="9">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERMES 165 A gulrgu//e IA]:A. and A. kisanfuensis A angustalus A. porn'ex A. desneuxi I Bas Congo A famani FIG. 3. Diagram of horizontal sections through discrete conduits. Internal opening at the bottom. Black indicates lining material. (Mostly modified from Desneux, 1953.) decreases as the amount of unenclosed area decreases. The progressive enclosure of the gal- leries in this series as well as the fact that the nest from Mayidi shows several stages of enclosure within the same nest, sug- gests strongly that the phylogeny of gal. leries may closely parallel the ontogeny of galleries in a single nest. Figure 2 il- lustrates a hypothetical method of gallery construction. Unfortunately the actual process has not been observed. How- ever, a method of gallery formation such as illustrated would certainly be the sim- plest and has proved to be of great value in the study of the phylogenetic order of nests. The evolution of the galleries in this series can best be visualized by study- ing figure 2. Desneux (1953) points out the phy- logenetic significance of conduit changes through the series from A. kisantuensis to A. porifex (fig. 3). In the nest of A. gurgulifeex the sides of the conduit are straight and its internal and external open- ings about equal in width. As nearly as can be determined from a single photo- graph in Desneux (1953), the conduits of A. desneuxi are about the same as those of A. gurgulifex. Two types of nest, as characterized by different conduits, have been included under A. kisantuensis. The conduits of the first type, A. kisantuensis I, differ from the previous nests by the projection of large tooth-like structures from their floors into the circular gal- leries (figs. 1 and 5), the sides of each conduit remaining parallel. This tooth is homologous to the lower part of the gargoyles of A. gurgulifex. The conduits of A. kisantuensis II differ further by a constriction of their sides at the center. A. angustatus also consists of two main types. A. angustatus A differs from A. kisantuensis II largely by the increased constriction of the lumen of the conduit. The teeth projecting into the galleries are also reduced. These teeth entirely dis- appear in A. angustatus B. Here the entrance of the conduit into the gallery may be almost level with the gallery wall or may take the shape of a slightly raised, tube-like projection (figs. 1 anld 5). In both types of A. kisantuensis the width of the conduit at its center is about one-half or miore of the proximal width (i.e., the width of the internal slit), while both types of A. angustatus have conduits with central widths about one-fourth or less of the proximal width (table 1). The con- duit is further constricted over most of its length in the nests of A. porifex, and the internal opening is no longer a slit but a pore. The opening of the conduit into the gallery is similar to that of A. an- gustatus B. The increased narrowing of the lumen of the conduit in this series is paralleled by an increase in the amount of special lining material of the conduit (figs. 1 and 3). The A. porifex nest from Kipala ap- parently differs from the Luluabourg specimen only by the absence of this lin- ing material. This may merely be the result of erosion of the nest fragment be- fore discovery (Desneux, 1953). The</page><page sequence="10">166 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT differences between measurements of the two nests is only slight (table 1). Table 1 gives measurements that il- lustrate the changes of the conduit in this series. The width of the conduit floors of different species was measured at each end and at the center. The average for each measurement was then divided by the mean width of the internal opening of the conduit. A 1 :1 :1 ratio is seen until A. kisantuensis is reached. The first figure then greatly increases because of the wide tooth projecting into the gal- lery. In A. kisantuensis II, the second figure is reduced by about one-half as the conduit narrows at the center. The rest of the series is characterized by a con- tinuing smaller ratio as the lumen of the conduit narrows farther and the tooth disappears. The number of internal slits per unit length seems to be somewhat greater in nests of A. kisantuensis and following species than in A. gurgulifex, A. desnesxi, or the nest from Mayidi. This is in- dicated by a decrease in the distance be- tween centers of slits and the distance be- tween external pores (table 1). Variation in A. kisantuensis and A angusta.tus: Desneux (1948, 1953) has snggested that the various nests now grouped under A. kisantuensis and A. angustatus may actually represent mnore than just two species. It is likely that when sufficient material (both termiites and nests) becomes available, splitting of these species may be necessary. The two types of A. 1k,isantuensis (I and II) and of A. angustatus (A and B) may each represent at least a single species or sub- species. Especially in A. kisantuensis, there seemis to be considerable variation be- tween different populations. Many of these differences are significant. The nest fromn Boende in particular seemns to differ from other A. kisantuensis nests, (table 1).

The external surface of the nests of A. kisantuensis and A. angustatus also shows considerable variation.

To what extent the variability found within species and major nest types of A. kisantuensis and A. angustatus represents specific, racial, or environmentally pro- duced differences cannot be determined at present. The nest from Mayumbe: This nest is of special interest since it seems to show different stages of gallery formation within the same specimen. Complete circular galleries are present in the greater por- tion of the nest. However, a few of the lower stories show only simple conduits and gargoyles as in the nest of A. gurguli- fex. Between these two zones, there exists a row or two of gargoyles in the process of lateral fusion and extension of the upper lip of the external opening. This nest has led Desneux (1948, 1953) to postulate construction of the galleries for this nest as illustrated in figure 2. There is no reason to suppose that this process is essentially different for other</page><page sequence="12">168 ROBERT S.

Due to the many similarities, one might suppose that the nest from Mayumbe be- longs to the A. gurgulifex-A. porifex series. However, Desneux (1948, 1953) points out a basic difference that makes it impossible to consider this nest closely related to the other members of the porif ex group with galleries. The hypothetical ontogeny of the circular galleries, al- though superficially similar to that of A. kiscantuensis, can be seen to be different (fig. 2). The construction of galleries in these two branches of the porif exv group seems to be analogous and there- fore convergent, rather than homologous. In the development of galleries in A. kiscantuensis the external pores are open- ings left between the downward projecting upper lips of the gargoyles. The external pores in the Mayumbe nest result from incomplete fusion of the distal end of the overlapping upper lip with the wall. This results in the external and internal open- ings in A. kisantuensis being alternate, while in the Mayumbe nest they are op- posite. The nest from Mayumbe is therefore probably related to the nest of A. gur- gulifex, as shown by the presence of simple conduits and gargoyles in the lower parts of the nest. However, the different method of gallery construction implies a separate origin from a gurgulif ex- type nest than the other members of the porifex group. It would seem more prob- able that the origin was separate than that the relation between internal and external openings changed secondarily. It is impossible to say whether the builders of the Mayumbe nest branched off from a gurgulifex-like ancestor be- fore or after the divergence of other members of the group. The latter ori- gin may possibly be suggested by the similarity in the distance between ex- ternal pores of the Mayumbe nest and the A. gurgulifex nest (table 1). These nests are also somewhat similar in shape, being truncated at both ends with more or less straight sides. Emerson (1952a) derives both the Mayumbe nest and the A. kisanttensis-A. porifex series from an ancestor with gal- leries having opposite openings. How- ever, this would necessitate a secondary rearrangement of the openings in A. kisantuensis, which seems unlikely. It is, of course, possible that the two types of galleries may have radiated from an A. desneuxi type of nest, resulting in parallel rather than convergent evolution. The Bas Congo Nest The "occultts" and porif ex groups have been shown by a number of char- acteristics to be distinct, separate branches of the genus. The members within each group can also be shown to be related by a number of criteria. Up to this point the phylogenetic order in Apicotermes is fairly clear. However, the placement of the Bas Congo nest is rather speculative, although the evidence suggests its early divergence from the base of the porifex group. Unfortunately, one must proceed without study of the termites themselves, since no inhabitants have as yet been col- lected with this type of nest. The Bas Congo nest is oriented in an envelope of sand. The shagreen network is of the type that is very friable and easily scraped from the wall of the nest. Separate internal parietal slits are pres- ent. The ramps are direct and scattered. In these characteristics, this nest agrees closely with the porifex group. The shagreen network, although fria- ble, is very heavy and uniformly covers the nest surface. The internal slits are less than half-way from the floor to the ceiling and average over 5 mm. in width, by far the widest of any known nest. This is the only type of nest having in- ternal slits appreciably wider than the distance between slits (table 1, fig. 5). These features differ from the porif ex group.</page><page sequence="14">170 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT The low internal slits suggest a rela- tionship to the "occultus" group. The upper lip of the external opening of the conduit projects downward (figs. 1 and 2). The distal end of the over- lapping lip usually fuses with the wall only in the lower stories of the nest. Adjacent hoods often fail to fuse laterally, so that there remains between them a vertical slit ending in a pore-like struc- ture at the upper end that is analogous to the external pores of A. kisantuensis. Photographs in the papers by Desneux seem to indicate that these vertical slits are alternate with the internal parietal slits. The space partially or entirely en- closed under the overlapping hoods seems to be structurally similar and probably functionally analogous to the circular gal- leries of other nests. The presence of different stages in the same nest suggests that the galleries are built in a manner somewhat similar to those of the Mayumbe nest and of A. kisantuensis nests (fig. 2). This also inmplies a relationship to the porifex group. The evidence suggests that the Bas Congo nest is related to the porifex group, although a close relationship to any of its known miembers is unlikely. Because of the very wide internal slits, it is proba- ble that the galleries of the Bas Congo nest originated independently from those of the porifex group. This species and the main branch of the porifex group may have diverged early, before the origin of galleries-the former retaining a heavy shagreen network, while the extent of this layer decreased in the latter. The low conduits, as in the "occultus" group, also suggest an early origin of the Bas Congo nest. Divergence of the Bas Congo line from the porifex line before the origin of galleries seems to be implied by the improbability of the loss of circular gal- leries followed by a second origin in the Mayumbe nest and in A. kisantuensis. The differences between the Bas Congo nest and the nests of the "occultus" group prevent one from contemplating too close a relationship between these. Another possible origin of this nest should be considered. The ancestors of the Bas Congo nest might have branched off before the divergence of the porifex and "occultus" groups. These ancestors would probably have been without circular galleries for the reasons already stated. In his phylogeny, Emerson (1952a) derives all Apicotermes nests from a Bas Congo type of nest. However, this would require regression of the somewhat in- complete Bas Congo galleries and a sub- sequent secondary origin of galleries in the Mayumbe nest, A. kisantuensis, and A. arqguieri. However, the funnels of A. lamani could conceivably have evolved by downward extension of the hoods of a Bas Congo-like nest. Although unlikely, the possibility should be mentioned that the Bas Congo nest may not belong to Apicotermes but rather to a closely related genus. Such a sup- position does not seem necessary, how- ever, since the difference between this nest and others known to belong to Apicotermes is no greater than the differ- ence between some of these other nests. A Hypothetical Common Ancestor Present data do not permit more than a speculative reconstruction of the nest of the immediate common ancestor of known species of Apicotermes. How- ever, future collections may someday per- mit a reasonable approach to an accurate reconstruction. The hypothetical com- mon ancestor shown in figure 2 permits one to relate the different groups with the least difficulty. Because of the considerable difference between the three groups, it seems pref- erable to attempt to derive them sepa- rately from a very simple nest rather than from any nest resembling those of known species. Due to the improbability of re- gression of galleries followed by a triple secondary evolution of these structures, this ancestor was probably without gal- leries. The walls of this nest might be visualized as being perforated by discrete</page><page sequence="15">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERMES 171 slits, lower than half-way from floor to ceiling. The external openings of these slits would project little, if any, from the surface of the nest. From this type of structure the nest of A. gurgulifex and the nest from Bas Congo may be derived independently with no difficulty. This can be seen in figure 2, which suggests phylogenetic as well as developmental re- lationships. The funnels of the nests of A. lamani may be imagined as evolving by the ex- tension of the upper lip of the external opening of the conduits. These exten- sions, rather than fusing with the wall at the distal end, as in A. kisantuensis, would fuse to the wall at their sides, thus forming funnels. The origin of the A. arquieri nest is difficult to visualize from any beginning. It is impossible to derive it from any known nest, although a highly speculative derivation may be obtained from the an- cestor postulated here. If the lower lip, rather than the upper lip as in other species, were to be extended downward and fuse with the wall, the structure of A. arqutieri nests would result. Lateral con- nection of adjacent conduits could then have taken place to achieve the continuous conduit characteristic of that nest. The origin of continuous slits may very well have been dependent upon the prior origin of circular galleries. A primary continuity of slits would have provided no wall support, in the absence of an external gallery wall. NEST VARIABILITY AND ITS CAUSES Table 1 shows that the variability be- tween populations of a species varies with the species. Further collections may in- dicate a greater variability in some of these species. The measurements for two populations of A. lamani are seen to be very close. The difference between three measurements of the two Bas Congo popu- lations are not significant. The varia- bility between populations of A. kisantuen- sis, even of the same major type, are seen to be considerable. The linmited amount of nmaterial available for this study does not permit a compre- hensive view of variability within each species. The differences between species and between the major types of A. kisantuensis and A angustatus are un- doubtedly of genetic origin. However, some of the differences within a species or colony may be the result of other factors. Meteorological conditions, soil composi- tion, nest size, learning( ?), population structure, and population size are only a few of the possibilities that come to mind. This question can be settled only by a detailed study of the ecology and behavior of the group. Schneirla (in Emerson, 1952a) cau- tions that "similar outcomes may be reached by behavior processes which may have much in common or very little in common." This is also true of morpho- logical characteristics which, although similar, nmay be either homologous or re- sult from different developmental and physiological processes. However, there is nothing to suggest that a particular type of Apicotermes nest is not the work of a single species or that a single species builds more than one type of nest. In no case have different types of nests been found inhabited by the same species of termite. Neither has the same type of nest been found associated with different species. Zoogeographical and ecological data, although not extensive enough to provide much positive evidence, at least are in no way in conflict with the phy- logeny presented here. In other words, the ethological data are corroborated by morphological, zoogeographical, and eco- logical data. DISCUSSION There is no evidence to contradict the assumption that nest-building behavior in termites is innate and instinctive. Cer- tainly, colony founding by a single pair of reproductives would eliminate the pos- sibility of workers (which appear only</page><page sequence="16">172 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT after these reproductives have left the parent colony) learning these behavior patterns from earlier generations of work- ers. Innate or instinctive behavior is considered here to be those movements or acts, occurring in response to a specific set of stimuli, for which previous perform- ance as a result of these stimuli is not necessary for the functional completeness of the neural pathways controlling that behavior. The repetition of the behavior pattern, in such instances, is initiated by genetic factors passing from one genera- tion to another through the germ plasm. Lehrman (1953) seems to consider most behavior learned. However, his reason- ing is rather difficult to follow and his arguments seem to be largely semantic. Although criticizing the use of "instinct," he offers no adequate substitute. Teleology and anthropomorphism have no place (when used literally) in the study of innate behavior. An extreme example of such use is seen in a paper by Bugnion (1927). For instance, in dis- cussing the evolution of defense behavior in termite soldiers, he says that "the origin of most of these instincts is a reasoned and conscious action." Emerson (in Allee et al., 1949) states that "the evolution of behavior results from similar forces and follows patterns similar to those characteristic of morpho- logical evolution, and . . . both depend upon physiological development and ge- netic interactions." As early as 1898, Whitman (1899) remarked that "instinct and structure are to be studied from the common standpoint of phyletic descent." To a certain extent behavior is deter- mined and modified by the physiologi- cal (e.g., hormonal) processes and the morphological equipment of the organism. Behavioral changes would therefore be expected to parallel evolutionary, genetic changes in morphology and physiology. Evidence also indicates direct genetic changes of the nervous system itself. Further discussion of this subject is be- yond the scope of this paper. An excel- lent general review of ethological evolu- tion is given by Tinbergen (1951, chaps. 7 and 8). A remarkable difference is seen be- tween the degree of radiation of behavior and structure in the two neuter castes of termites. The morphological features of the workers show minimum radiation. Such conservative characters are of great value in determining the relations between genera and higher categories, but are rela- tively useless in species identification. On the other hand this caste shows consider- able variation of behavior, as illustrated by the many nest types already known for Apicotermes. In contrast, the soldiers show considerable morphological adapta- tion, hence proving the most useful speci- mens for species determination but often -being of less value than the morpho- logically conservative workers for relating higher categories. The known behavior differences of soldiers within a genus are relatively small. Nest-building behavior in Apicotermes illustrates particularly well several prin- ciples analogous to structural evolution. These will be discussed in greater detail. Adaptation The nests of termites have obviously evolved toward a high degree of social homeostasis, providing considerable regu- lation of the environment (e.g., tempera- ture and humidity) and protection from enemies (e.g., predators and fungi). A high selective advantage of the vari- ous systems of wall perforation is in- dicated by their occurrence in all known nests of Apicotermes, with the exception of A. "occultus." It is generally assumed that the function of such structures is to permit the exchange of gases between the interior and exterior of the nest (Des- neux, 1953; Emerson, 1953). Although there is no supporting experimental evi- dence, this seems to be a safe assumption, for the carbon dioxide tension in such underground nests must become very high, and the oxygen tension rather low.</page><page sequence="17">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERMES 173 However, the assignment of a par- ticular function to a structure without ex- perimental verification sometimes involves a certain degree of hazard. This is sug- gested here by the fact that although the function of the perforation systems as a whole seems to be for gas exchange, the evidence concerning the specific function of the circular galleries within this sys- tem is rather contradictory. The im- portance of the galleries cannot be denied, for they appear to have originated inde- pendently four times. Certain factors suggest that the func- tion of the circular gallery may be some- thing other than gas exchange per se. A preliminary experiment has been made comparing the rate of diffusion across models of the walls of various species of Apicotermes nests. The meager data thus far obtained suggests that the galleries may have little or nothing to do with the rate of diffusion, this apparently being determined (as might be expected) by the size of the smallest parietal opening (in most cases the external opening). If this is at all indicative of the actual situation, it is interesting to note the possible sig- nificance of the decrease in conduit width in the A. kisantuensis-A. porifex series. If diffusion is proportional to the perim- eter of the smallest (external) opening of the gallery, the larger size of the internal slit would be of no advantage to the species from the standpoint of gas ex- change. Therefore a narrowing of the conduit could take place without adverse effects upon the "ventilating system" but possibly with some advantage such as in- creased protection from water, predators, or fungi. Such a possibility is also con- sistent with the presence of wide con- duits in A. gurgulifex and A. desneuxi- both without galleries (and without the small external openings of galleries) and therefore able to take full advantage of the greater rate of diffusion offered by wide slits. In the case of nests with galleries, the lower rate of diffusion would presumably be compensated for by added protection. It cannot be overemphasized, however, that the experiment mentioned here was preliminary and the result can be considered no more than suggestive. Additional work with this method is in progress and it is hoped that it may give some instructive results. The somewhat similar nests of the South American termite Procornitermes lespesii also have circular galleries and are sub- terranean in hollow cavities (Emerson, 1952b). However, the galleries of these nests have neither internal nor external openings (apparently never had them) and therefore could not function directly for gas exchange (except possibly to pro- duce thinning of the wall). It is, of course, possible that the function of the galleries in Procornitermes may be en- tirely different from that in Apicotermes. The regulation of internal nest tem- peratures against external fluctuations has been suggested as a possible function of the galleries (Desneux, 1953; Emerson, 1952b). It is questionable, however, whether the relatively slight temperature changes to which these termites are sub- jected, being subterranean and tropical, would provide the selective pressure for the evolution of such apparently impor- tant structures. It is difficult to see how the primitive stages of gallery evolution could provide increased temperature con- trol. Maintenance of high temperatures within the nest could also be a function, although this would meet with some of the same objections just noted concerning possible protection fronm external tempera- ture changes. Desneux (1953) suggests that the nests of the A. kisantuensis-A. porifex series, once completed, may be enlarged accord- ing to the spatial needs of the inhabitants. He shows several photographs suggest- ing that secondary galleries may be built on the outside of a completed nest and that the inner, original galleries may then be removed. The evidence for this is still not conclusive, however. It has been found that at least some species of Apico- termes have colonies composed of a num-</page><page sequence="18">174 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT ber of nests of various sizes (Desneux, 1953; Grasse and Noirot, 1948b). Grasse (1952) considers colony enlargement to take place by addition of another nest. Perhaps colony growth takes place by both of these methods. Thus it appears that the direct par- ticipation of circular galleries in the regu- lation of gas exchange across the nest wall is open to serious question. The most likely function seems to be protec- tion of the conduits from soil water, predators, fungi, parasites, or some other factor. Such a function would not be inconsistent with the apparent method of origin. The overlapping upper lip (pos- sibly lower lip in A. arquieri) could quite conceivably provide protection for the con- duits even though a function of tempera- ture or diffusion regulation is more dif- ficult to imagine. Protection, especially from water, is also suggested by the downward slanting funnels of A. lamani. The conduits of most species also slant downward and outward. An exception to this is the inward slanting continuous conduits of A. arquieri. It should be noted, however, that none of the present evidence on the function of the galleries is adequate, and a final answer to this problem must await further data. These structures may even function in several ways or have changed their function dur- ing the course of their evolution. The partial closure of internal parietal slits by sand and mortar has already been noted as interfering with slit measure- ment. Because of the variation in the degree of closure within a nest and be- tween nests from different localities, Des- neux (1953) has suggested that the de- gree of closure may be determined by local gas exchange needs. If such a regu- lation exists, it would be impossible at present to know whether the degree of slit closure is irreversibly determined by the conditions present when the slits were originally built, or whether they may be later modified as environmental conditions change. As the field of ethology advances, it might be expected that behavioral homeo- static mechanisms will be found to be more common. A few such mechanisms known for other groups of animals will be mentioned here. Richter (1942-1943) has shown that certain surgically produced hormone deficiencies in rats would modify the animal's dietary preferences in such a way as to largely compensate for the physiological disturbances caused by the operation. For instance, if a parathyroid- ectomized rat was provided with both ordinary water and water with calcium added, it would drink sufficient amounts of the calcium water to prevent excessive symptoms due to the removal of the para- thyroid. He also found that hypophysec- tomized rats, now incapable of adequate heat production, built much larger nests than normal animals. Some of the well known homeostatic mechanisms of bees have been reviewed by Chauvin (1954). For instance, pe- riods of increased activity during the winter prevent the temperature of the cluster from dropping to a fatal low, and by fanning, bees are able to increase air circulation within the hive. Convergence If the phylogeny presented here is ap- proximately correct, the circular galleries probably have evolved independently four times. The two main branches, the "oc- cultus" and the porifex groups, are quite different and the lowest member of each branch is without these structures. The galleries of the Mayumbe nest have been shown to be formed in a manner peculiar to that nest and therefore have probably evolved independently. The Bas Congo nest, although uncertain as to position, seems to have arisen from stock without galleries and is not very closely related to other groups with galleries. Although examples of convergent evo- lution are nuLmerous, few show such re- peated convergence within a single genus. For instance, the presence of striking dis- play behavior by the males of certain</page><page sequence="19">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERM1JES 175 species of crabs, squid, fish, lizards, and birds is noted by Tinbergen (1953). Social parasitism is found among the cow- birds, cuckoos, weavers, honey-guides, and ducks (Friedmann, 1929). Mimetic re- semblances are also known (Cott, 1940). Mosauer (1930, 1935) has discussed the similarity in locomotion on loose sand of the sidewinder of the Southwest United States and the African sand viper of the Sahara Desert. Friedman (1946) notes that the African pipit (Macronyx) and the American meadow-lark (Sturnella) show a number of ethological (e.g., song, nests, turning away from an approaching observer) as well as morphological simi- larities. Rain-shedding structures have evolved independently in nests of the Amitermitinae, Termitinae, and Nasuti- termitinae (Emerson, 1938). The simiL larity of the nests of Procornitermes and Apicotermes has already been noted (Des- neux, 1953; Emerson, 1952b). Cases of convergence within a single genus are more easily found for morphological than for ethological characteristics; for in- stance, the independent origin of terminal tail rackets in two birds, Dicrurus rernifer and D. par-adiseus (Mayr and Vaurie, 1948). Regression The modern theory of regressive evolu- tion is based largely on the following factors (Emerson, in Allee et al., 1949): 1. Most genes (pleiotropic) affect more thani one character. 2. Most characters (polygenic) are af- fected by more than one gene. 3. Each gene mutates at a specific sta- tistical rate. 4. Most mutations are deleterious. 5. Entire organisms or populations are selected, as well as the parts of each. A structure, physiological process, or in- nate behavior pattern would be expected to remain functional as long as it is maintained by a positive selection pres- sure. Loss or reduction of this positive pressure may lead to regression. Such loss or reduction might result from an environmental change, bringing about con- ditions to which the character is not as well adapted, or under which it is detri- mental. In the latter case there would be a negative selection pressure against the character. However, regression may also occur in the absence of negative pressure (Wright, 1929). Wright (in Emerson, 1938) states that "the type allele in each series is that which has the miost favorable net effect on all characters. If one char- acter loses in importance relative to others, there will be a shift in the alleles in many series with degeneration of the clharacter losing importance as a con- sequence of the increased development of the others." Therefore a neutral char- acter will eventually regress because of the lack of positive selection pressure maintaining it and because of the shift of alleles in favor of other characters. Re- gressive evolution is tllus seen to bring about increased total adaptation rather than decreased adaptation as the term "degeneration" so often seems to imply. This theory explains not only the loss of characters, but also the temporary reten- tion of neutral or slightly detrimental characters. Because of the large number of genes involved in any one character, the generally slow rate of mutation, and the fact that most mutations are del- eterious, the regression of a character (through the shift of alleles mentioned above) would be expected to take con- siderable time. The isolation of galleries in the nests of A. "occultus" seems to have resulted from the regression of wall perfora- tions (Desneux, 1953; Emerson, 1953). Neither internal nor external gallery open- ings are present. The galleries them- selves also seem to be on the way out, since they frequently end blindly rather than continue around the entire circum- ference of the nest. The closest known relative, A. arqmieri, has complete gal- leries with somewhat regressed internal and external openings, and it seems more likely that the galleries of this species</page><page sequence="20">176 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT have evolved in the manner already sug- gested than that they evolved from the isolated galleries of A. "occultus." It seems likely that the wall perfora- tions of A. arquieri may also be in the process of regression. Only a few of the external pores are entirely open-the rest being absent or appearing only as slight depressions. The height of the continu- ous conduit is less than the discrete con- duit height of most of the other nests. The walls of the conduit are rough and granular. The granularity of the upper and lower surface may come into con- tact, although small spaces remain be- tween the surface projections. The inter- nal slit appears to be basically continuous. However, closer observation shows it to be closed at irregular intervals by bits of mortar, so that actually it is open for only about one-half of its total length. Little can be said at present concern- ing the cause of this regression. Both species inhabit savanna. The drier soil of the savanna would probably permit greater gas exchange than the soil of the rain-forest, so that wall perforations might be of less value (Emerson, 1952a). Per- haps in the savanna, conservation of mois- ture within the nest may become of greater importance than gas exchange. Emerson (1953) postulates that the genus origi- nated in the rain-forest, since this is where most of the species of Apicotermes and most of the closely related genera are found. It is also possible that these spe- cies may have acquired increased toler- ance to high carbon dioxide and low oxygen tensions, thereby reducing the adaptive value of wall perforations. A change in porosity of the wall or its orientation in a space rather than in an envelope of sand may also be involved. Even if the apparent reduction of wall perforations in A. arquieri should be found not to be due entirely to regression, the vestigial galleries of A. "occultus" will still provide an excellent example of regressive behavior. The fungus gardens of Sphaerotermes sphaerothorax may also be an example of regressed behavior. All other members of the Macrotermitinae that have been studied grow fungi. S. sphaerothorax is the only known species of this subfamily that does not raise fungi, although fungus gardens (without fungi) are still built (Grasse and Noirot, 1948a). Ontogeny The fact that what appears to be sev- eral stages of gallery formation are often found in a single nest and the gradual evolution of galleries as seen in the A. gurgulifex-A. kisantuensis series permits a hypothetical reconstruction of gallery ontogeny, although this process has never actually been observed. It seems quite likely that the construc- tion of the galleries in the Bas Congo and porifex groups shows a recapitulation of the evolutionary stages of these struc- tures. Such a recapitulation is not too surprising. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a method of gallery formation more logical or simpler than that illus- trated in figure 2. The hypothetical de- velopment as well as the evolution of galleries seems to consist basically of the overlapping of the upper lips of the ex- ternal conduit openings. No stage of this continuous extension could be omitted without disrupting the continuity of the gallery. Therefore, recapitulation, in this particular instance, would seem almost unavoidable. Of course, it is recognized that the phenomenon mentioned here is considerably different than recapitulation in the sense of the appearance of certain ancestral characteristics during the ontog- eny of an organism. Here the ancestral stages are repeated in an extraorganismic structure rather than in the organism it- self; the repetition is not associated with the development of an organism but with a "full-grown" organism (the worker ter- mite) ; and the nest is produced not by an individual organism but by a colony (supraorganism). Perhaps the term "re- capitulation" is not even justified here, although its use is conveniently descrip-</page><page sequence="21">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERMES 177 tive. It is not meant to imply that re- capitulation is necessarily a general phe- nomenon of ethological development. The recapitulation discussed here extends back only to the A. gurgulifex stage. Neither does this recapitulation necessarily imply a similar process in the development of the behavioral equipment of the worker termite. The nests of Apicotermes show radial symmetry. There is radial (e.g., con- duits and external pores) and vertical (e.g., galleries, lamellae, and ramps) rep- lication of structure. Emerson (1947) analogizes this replication to the pores in the walls of a sponge of the ascon or sycon type. Nest regeneration is known among other termites, but has not yet been ob- served in Apicotermes. Emerson (1951) has observed reconstruction in a Cubi- termes intercalatus nest in the Belgian Congo. Hingston (1932) has made ex- perimental observations on behavioral re- generation of rain-shedding ridges of a Constrictotermes cazifrons nest. Grasse (1937) has observed workers of Macro- termes ( = Bellicositermes) repairing holes that he had broken in the nest. Certain cocoon-building insects are also capable of repairing these structures to some ex- tent. Van der Kloot (1953) has shown that the Cecropia silkworm is able to re- build destroyed parts of the outer layer of the cocoon, if it has not yet begun work on the inner layer. Grasse (1937) notes that nest enlarge- ment (analogous to the growth of an organism) takes place in some termites. In Macrotermes (= Bellicositernwes), the application of new mortar to a part being enlarged seems to be preceded by a de- struction of the wall in that area. The presence of a royal cell relatively high above the ground also indicates that this part of the nest must have been moved during the growth of the nest. This might involve some reorganization of the nest interior as well as enlargement. Emerson (1938) illustrates the enlarge- ment of a nest of Nasutitermes quayanae by additions of cells on the outside. The Supraorganism Emerson (1952a, in Allee et al., 1949) has used Apicotermes to illustrate the principle of the supraorganism. Schneirla (1946) objects to the use of analogies be- tween different levels of organization. He says: "It is questionable whether the deductive leaps of the analogy method provide a legitimate means of studying the past history of animal societies or the nature of their present integra- tions. . . . Analogical procedures such as those involved in using the 'superorganism' concept are not adequate for studying social levels com- paratively." 1Hlowever, Emerson has defended both the supraorganism concept (1952a) and the use of analogy (1952a, 1954). He (in Allee et al., 1949) makes the following comment concerning analogy: "It is true that in comparing distinict integra- tive levels, homologies (resemblances with a common genetic basis) cannot be assumed, al- though we have seen . . . that the identical mechanisms of one level may sometimes integrate a higher level. Similarities may, however, be convergent and therefore analogous, anld a com- parison of similar pressures guiding unlike organisms toward analogous functions is sig- nificant." Boyden (1947) objects to the application of the term homology to ethological simi- larities because of the frequent difficulty in demonstrating a common ancestor and because of its original restriction by Owen to morphological similarities. However, such a view would seem to overlook the value of the term in indicating common origins and genetic similarities. The evolution and radiation of the com- plex nests of Apicotermes, built by sterile workers, can be explained only by the selection of the entire colony as a unit. Such group selection is also seen in the evolution of the worker and soldier castes of termites. Worker sterility also elimi- nates the possibility of Lamarkian in- fluences on the evolution of such charac-</page><page sequence="22">178 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT ters as nest-building behavior. Darwin (1877, pp. 230-233) and Weismann (1893) were among the first to recognize the evolutionary significance of "neuter" castes. The Use of Behavior in Building Phylogenies In any study of phylogeny it is of the utmost importance to use and correlate all available data from all available sources. A failure in this respect is seen in Kem- ner's (1927) classification of Javanese termite nests and the classification of caddis flies (based upon feeding behavior and case) by Milne and Milne (1939). Although these workers present valuable information concerning the constructions of these insects, Emerson (1938 and per- sonal communication) notes that their phylogenies based tipon behavior are not verified by the morphological data. Since both behavior and structure have evolved by similar methods, one is not a priori more important than another in determin- ing phylogenetic relationships. A truly accurate phylogeny must be able to ac- commodate data on all organismic char- acteristics. Obviously the structural prop- erties of an organism have not evolved completely apart from its behavior. Selec- tion, of course, is applied to each whole integrated organism or organismic unit such as the supraorganism. The importance of behavior as an in- dicator of phylogenetic relationships is finally being recognized. The use of be- havior in this manner emphasizes the simi- larities between the evolution of ethologi- cal and morphological characters. So far, relatively few studies of comparative be- havior relate more than a small number of species. More investigations compar- ing large numbers of closely related spe- cies are to be desired. A few interesting studies will be briefly noted here. Emerson (1938) has made a compara- tive study of termite nests largely at the family and generic level. He also deals with the nest-building behavior of the termites themselves and discusses the evolutionary implications of termite nests. Many of the papers of Grasse and of Grasse and Noirot deal with termite nests and nest-building behavior [e.g., the con- struction of the royal cell in CepJhalo- termes rectangularis (Grasse, 1939)]. Grasse's 1944 paper on the nests of the Macrotermitinae shows that behavior may also characterize higher taxonomic cate- gories. An outstanding study of the evolution of behavior is the work of Lorenz (1941) on the calls and mating behavior of some of the Anatinae. His diagram of the phylogenetic relationships between the species studied correlates a number of morphological as well as behavioral char- acteristics. In some cases he has been able to arrange series, showing the evolu- tion of a highly modified behavior pattern from a more primitive pattern. Delacour and Mayr (1945) state that such etho- logical characters as pair formation, dis- plays, nesting and feeding habits, are of more value than certain previously em- phasized morphological characters. For instance, bill shape is so adaptive that it can be used for little more than species identification. Petrunkevitch (1926) notes the value of such characteristics as type of web and manner of caring for the egg cocoon for spider classification. Early workers in the field were often over-enthusiastic in their use of behavior, occasionally mak- ing errors resulting from the confusion of analogous with homologous behavior. This again emphasizes the importance of using all available evidence in building a phylogeny. Friedmann (1929) finds that the phy- logenic series, Agelaioides badius-Molo- thrus rufo-axillaris-M. bonariensis-M. aster, is indicated by nesting behavior and song as well as by zoogeography and structure. The first bird in this series has no courtship display, incubates its own eggs which are laid in the nests of other birds, and has a "primitive, formless type of song." The next two species show a simple courtship display, are parasitic,</page><page sequence="23">NEST-BUILDING IN APICOTERMES 179 and have a more or less typical cowbird song. The last in the series has a more elaborate display, is parasitic, and has a clearer song. The behavior of two cap- tive young males of M. aster is of interest. The development of mating behavior dur- ing their first spring showed a recapitula- tion of the behavior of their more primi- tive relatives until the adult behavior typi- cal of the species was finally exhibited. These birds had been raised in the ab- sence of others of this species. Fried- mann (1948) makes a similar report on the parasitic breeding habits of African cuckoos. However, the data are not as complete as in the case of cowbirds. Davis (1940, 1942) has studied the communal nesting behavior of the Croto- phaginae (the Anis), a South American subfamily of the cuckoos. He arranges- the four species in the order: Guira guira -Crotophaga major-C. ani and C. sul- cirostrus. The commuunity in the first species consists of a number of separate pairs of birds which may sometimes nest separately and defend a small territory within the territory of the flock. In the second species, the pairs unite to defend the flock territory and the group builds a single nest. In C. ani, polygamy and promiscuity prevail and the pair defense is replaced by colonial defense of ter- ritory. Communal nesting seems to be related to parasitism, so common in other branches of the cuckoos. This is sug- gested by the fact that Guira has been reported to lay eggs occasionally in the nests of other birds. The phylogeny of Drosophila has prob- ably been studied by more methods than has that of any other group. To these methods may be added the studies of Spieth (1952) on the mating behavior of this group. He found that the ethological data for the species of Drosophila that he studied closely paralleled the data from other methods. He also has suggested a hypothetical ancestral mating pattern. The identification of caddis fly larvae is greatly facilitated by the cases built by so many of them. Identification is often made on the basis of case alone, little at- tention being paid to its inhabitant. For instance, Needham and Needham (1941) give a key to Trichoptera larvae, based mostly on case characteristics. Crane (1941) has made extensive studies of the crab Uca. She makes the following statement concerning their court- ship display: "Each species proved to have a definite, in- dividual display, differing so markedly from that of every other species observed, that closely related species could be recognized at a distance merely by the form of the display. Furthermore, related species had fundamental similarities of display in common, and series of species, showing progressive specialization of structure, in general showed similar progression in display." Chapin (1917) found that the generally accepted classification of the Ploceidae, based mostly on the length of the tenth primary, was largely artificial. In both subfamilies (as regrouped by Chapin) there appeared to be a convergent short- ening of this feather. In regrouping the members of this family, Chapin made con- siderable use of nesting behavior. In one of his subfamilies pensile, intricately woven nests are found, while in the other sub- family nests are neither pensile nor woven. SUM MARY Termite nests are species-specific prod- ucts of the nest-building behavior of the colony. The subterranean nests of Apico- term,tes provide unique material for the study of the evolution of behavior. Each species builds a very specific type of nest which shows distinct similarities to and differences from nests of other species of the genus. Nest characters show phy- logenetic relationships more clearly than do the morphological characteristics of the termites. Nest-building behavior in termites is probably entirely innate or instinctive, at least according to the defini- tion of "instinct" given here. Ethological evolution seems to be directed by the same forces as is morphological evolution. The nests of Apicotermies show particui-</page><page sequence="24">180 ROBERT S. SCHMIDT larly well several phenomena found also in the evolution of structural character- istics. Termite nests have evolved to- ward a high degree of social homeostasis, providing considerable regulation of the environment and protection from enemies. Wall perforations, apparently functioning to permit gas exchange between the in- terior and exterior of the nest, must be of considerable adaptive advantage, since they occur in the nests of all but one species of Apicotermes. Circular gal- leries possibly function by protecting these perforations from ground water and enemies that might otherwise enter the nest. Galleries may have evolved con- vergently as many as four times within the genus. Vestigial, partially regressed galleries are seen in one nest that has completely lost the openings of the gal- leries. Another nest seems to be in an earlier stage of this regression. The ap- parent method of gallery construction within a single nest seems to recapitulate stages in the evolution of these structures. These nests show radial symmetry and replication of structures. Apicotermes provides an excellent illustration of the supraorganism concept. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author is indebted to Dr. A. E.
