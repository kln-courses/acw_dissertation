Their legacy is reduced to the bare facts of names and addresses in diaries, notes relating to their physical merits and defects and the photographs themselves (although see Martin Postle's article in this issue, pp 20-27). Among this fascinating collection, however, there are several studies of a young model (Pis 3, 4, and see illustration on p 15) whose biography can be traced. Her name was Ethel Warwick, a beautiful young girl who played a significant role in the art and life of some of the most fashionable artists of her day. Her self-confidence, beauty and engaging personality allowed her to follow her high ambitions in a time when working-class girls still had few opportunities. If a girl was lucky enough to be beautiful and wanted a life of fine clothes, dancing and a taste of fame, she could work on the stage, in the brothel or in the studio. Amid the Aesthetic haze of opium and peacock feathers, there was money to be earned if your face was suitable for the jeunes filles fatales or the smouldering hot-house flower-girls painted by the decadent artists of Kensington or St John's Wood. Artists offered models a way to permeate a more glamorous and exciting society and Miss Warwick used the opportunities to great advantage. The increasing eminence of the artist's model reached its peak in the mid-1890s when public enthusiasm for the story of a model's life swept Britain and America. In 1894, Harper's Magazine published a serialisation of the novel by George du Maurier (grandfather of Daphne du Maurier), Trilby. The novel describes the intimate friendship of three British artists living in Paris in the 1850s and their affection for a young artist's model named Trilby O'Ferrall. The public success of Trilby was tremendous: 300,000 copies of the book were sold by the end of 1894, making it the best seller of the 19th century.1 Du Maurier 's treatment of Trilby's character is a sensitive portrayal of a girl who by circumstance of birth and fortune turned to modelling as a way of making a living. My motive in this article is to present a professional model whose life in many ways resembled that of the fictitious Trilby, although in her life there were even more twists and turns. Ethel Maud, the younger daughter of Francis (Frank) and Maude Warwick, was born in the small Northamptonshire village of Hardingstone on 13 October 1882. She was educated in Margate and Hampstead and in the early 1890s trained to be an artist at the London Polytechnic. It was at art school that she was brought into contact with artists' models. Several female artists funded their studies by modelling and it is likely that Ethel chose to be a model in order to pay for her tuition. Trilby may have been another catalyst for Ethel's decision to become a model as it presented a glamorous and almost acceptable side of a profession which for some years had been regarded as seedy and degenerate. The young Herbert Draper, a popular painter of classical mythologies, was the first to draw Ethel, studying her fine features for the face of the siren in his early masterpiece The Seamaiden (PI 6). She lived very close to his studio in West Kensington and it is likely that Draper saw her in the street and asked her to pose for him. At the time, she was only 14 years old and although her striking face suited the subject admirably, a more mature model was found for the actual figure of the sensual siren. Draper paid Ethel a shilling per hour, which was a reasonably good wage for a young unskilled woman. Young as she was (seventeen or eighteen, or thereabouts), and also tender, THlby had singularly clear and quick perceptions in all matters that concerned her tastes, fancies or affections, and thoroughly knew her own mind and never lost much time in making it up. This was Du Maurier's description of THlby, but could easily be of Ethel. By the later 1890s Ethel was well established as a professional artist's model but, as we shall see, she was destined for higher things. In 1897 Draper drew a sensitive portrait study of Ethel (private collection), which hung on his studio wall until his death. This is the only portrait drawing (rather than à study for a painting) of a model by Draper. It reflects the genuine 51</page><page sequence="2">1 Miss Ethel Warwick by John William Godward (1861-1922), 1898. Oil on canvas, 50.8 x 43.2 cm.

Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge respect and affection felt by the artist for the model who posed for some of his greatest works. Her most striking role in Draper's Greek tragedies was as a forlorn sea-nymph in the magnificent Lament for Icarus (Tate Britain), Draper's chef d'oeuvre. By 1897 when Draper was working on this large canvas, Ethel was already in demand by other artists. The shy John William Godward dressed her in diaphanous flower-tinted tulles for his classical reconstructions of languid idylls on marble terraces, and in 1898 painted an unusual portrait of Ethel, wearing a favourite hat and overcoat (PI 1). This picture records her appearance on arrival at the artist's studio before the trappings of the modern age were literally stripped away She must have been highly regarded by Godward to warrant such a direct portrait, bearing her own name as a title.2 In 1898 Ethel returned to art school, the prestigious Life Classes at the Royal Academy Schools. But this time she was not painting: she was posing as a model for the artists. Draper had, however, recognised her drawing ability and in his sketchbook for 1896 Ethel sketched caricatures of herself and the artist. Similar sketches can be found in the sketchbooks of the British Impressionist Philip Wilson Steer (Victoria and Albert Museum, Department of Prints and Drawings). Ethel Warwick posed for a portrait study and several images of modern domestic beauty by Steer, including Hydrangeas of 1901 (PI 5) and in a direct portrait (Johannesburg Art Gallery). Steer's sketchbooks in the Victoria and Albert Museum contain drawings of Ethel and the following poem by the young model: Oh poor old WS. Your thoughts I'd like to guess, You are so deep, But ere you sleep, You, like us, undress. Another strange but suggestive note by Ethel reads 'Find it (Art) "chase me boys".' Clearly Ethel knew Steer well enough to venture such risqué comments: perhaps she even Had first- hand knowledge of Steer chasing her or his nocturnal 52</page><page sequence="3">6 The Seamaiden by Herbert Draper (1863-1920), 1894.

Trilby herself explains how frequent it was for the artist/model relationship to lead to fumblings on the studio sofa: 'I have done dreadful things besides, as you must know - as all the Quartier knows.' The intimate situation presented by a naked female model posing for (usually) a male artist was almost unique in Victorian and Edwardian society. It is a strange paradox that it was generally regarded as acceptable for a young lady to remove all her clothes and be studied for hours on end by young artists, many of whom would rarely see their own wives naked. Du Maurier professed that 'all beauty is sexless in the eyes of the artist at his work' but this was far from the truth in many cases. During the Naughty Nineties, artists' models and actresses were regarded as the naughtiest of the naughty. Draper saw the stage production of Trilby at The Haymarket Theatre, only two days after Ethel had modelled for him on 4 December 1895. Ethel had a passion for the theatre and may have also seen a performance of Trilby. In the late 1890s she was training to become an actress and had enrolled at Henry Neville's acting school. She continued to pose for artists in order to earn her tuition fees and pay for her living expenses. By the turn of the century she had become well known among the community of artists living in Chelsea and was asked to pose for one of the greatest names in Victorian art, James Abbott McNeil Whistler. The character of the lazy and vain Joe Sibley in the version of Trilby published in Harper's Magazine was heavily based upon Whistler.3 Several female models could be described as Whistler's Trilby, including his mistress Jo and the Pettigrew sisters (who also posed for Godward and Sambourne: see illustration on p 22 of this issue) but, unlike Ethel, their ambitions were slight. John Walker's writes, About 1900 Whistler found a woman he considered the perfect model. Even when she was not posing, he kept sketching her from memory.'4 The unnamed model he refers to was Ethel Warwick, who was probably introduced to Whistler by his friend Steer. In her catalogue raisonnée, Margaret McDonald lists three studies of Ethel by Whistler, drawn on 4 June 1900 (James MacNeill Whistler: Drawings , Pastels and Watercolours , New Haven and London, 1995, nos. 1604, 1605, 1606). One of them (no. 1605) depicts Ethel holding an apple, which might have suggested that she is Venus or Eve if it were not for the model's expression, which as MacDonald states is open and friendly but not seductive. These drawings appear to have been made on the occasion of Ethel's first visit to Whistler's studio. He made many more drawings of her over the next few years and they became very attached to each other. Draper introduced Ethel to his great friend Ralph Peacock who painted a fragile portrait of the young model in 1898, entitled simply Ethel (Tate Britain). In 1900 Peacock completed a double portrait of Ethel and her older sister, entitled Sisters (Tate Britain). In Trilby, the young artist Little-Billie dreams of marrying Trilby and thus rescuing her from her lowly profession. Peacock realised the dream when he married Ethel's sister, but, perhaps unfortunately for Ethel, Godward was too shy to propose to her, and Draper had married before she was out of her teens. Ethel's introduction to Linley Sambourne came in July 1900, probably from Peacock, who was on friendly terms with the cartoonist. Ethel was asked to pose for photographs to add to the private collection of nude studies amassed by Sambourne whilst his wife's back was turned. Although the vast number of nude photographs taken by Sambourne would suggest a sexual fetish, many were taken to help him with his preparations for Punch cartoons. Ethel posed for several photographs in 1900, 1901 and 1904, sometimes alone and sometimes with the actress Mabel Hall, adopting classical poses or posing with props from around Sambourne's studio (Linley Sambourne House, Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea). In these more sexually liberated times, these photographs can appear very tame and sometimes comical, but they would have been regarded by many of Sambourne's less liberal contemporaries as pornography. It was still regarded by many as obscene for women to pose for photographs in the nude. Posing 'in the altogether' for artists was a different matter, because the results excused the means, but posing for photography (regarded as a lower art form) was frowned upon. Like Trilby, however, Ethel had no qualms about exposing herself: 53</page><page sequence="4">She would have ridden through Coventry, like Lady Godiva - but without giving it a thought beyond why the streets were empty and the shops closed and the blinds pulled down - would even have looked up at Peeping Tom's shutter with a friendly nod, had she known he was behind it. In fact she was absolutely without that kind of shame as she was without any kind of fear. All the artists Ethel posed for lived within walking distance of her house, which was off the North End Road at 14 Edith Villas in West Kensington. Draper lived less than 500 metres away and only ceased to use her as a model after his move to St John's Wood in 1898. Ethel stayed in contact with Draper, however, and returned to pose for him five years later when she herself moved to St John's Wood. Ethel regarded herself as a muse to the artists, but as she explains in another poem to her 'Old Pal' Steer her own painting remained important to her: Art is a wondrous gift, And comes from God above, It is my soul, my only son, This art of ours, I love.^ Like Trilby O'Ferrall, Ethel found fame on the stage rather than in a gallery. Many artists' models had acting ambitions and several actresses supplemented their wages by modelling. Such luminaries as the great Ellen Terry, Mrs Pat Campbell and Lillie Langtry had posed for artists, even when they were established dames of the stage. Ethel made her stage debut on 25 July 1900 at the Grande Theatre in Fulham, which was had recently been taken under new management by her acting tutor, Henry Neville, who secured for her the part of Emilie de Lesparre in The Corsican Brothers. Draper drew a humorous parody of the play, in which the actors are substituted with anthropomorphic costumed toads. Ethel's success in The Corsican Brothers led to a season at His Majesty's in 1900 in Herod , followed by a small part in Twelfth Night in 1901. Although she continued to pose intermittently for Sambourne, Whistler and Steer in the early years of the twentieth century, her acting commitments soon took her away from the studio and placed her up in the limelight. Instead of posing for Sambourne's camera, she posed for valentines and picture postcards to be sold to admiring fans and her image appeared in magazines such as Vanity Fair and The Tatler. After a short spell working for the famous Charles Wyndham, Ethel attracted the attention of another celebrated and wealthy theatre manager, Sir Frank Benson of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He engaged her for his productions in 1903 and, with Benson as her leading man, Ethel played some of the greatest female roles in Shakespeare, including Portia, Katherine and Juliet. In 1903 she also played another Shakespearean role, as a naked water nymph in Herbert Draper's painted ceiling Prospero summoning nymphs and deities for the Draper's Company Livery Halls. Although she was rapidly becoming a well-regarded actress, she could not abandon posing for artists and even contacted Draper to inform him that she was available again to pose. Ethel's stage career took her away from London and the artist's community in 1905. Although her artist friends tried to persuade her from leaving them and pursuing acting, she took the role of Zaza in the play of that name at the Grande Theatre in Birmingham. The wife of the famous actor/manager Lewis Waller (1865-1915), Florence (née West) owned the theatre company. When the play opened, her 20-year-old son Edmund had a minor part in the play. Edmund was promoted to the leading male role in 1905 and fell in love with his leading lady, Ethel. This was the artists' worst fear and was eventually to take Ethel away from them forever. Ethel's last portrait by Peacock appeared at the RA in 1905 under the title Portrait of a lady. This picture bears testimony to her increasing status, with her elegant ostrich- plumed hat, and the overcoat buttoned to the throat forms a striking contrast to the nude photographs taken by Sambourne in the same year. In 1905 she was still an unattached, free-willed young woman who was happy to remove her clothes for a picture. This was to change after she became romantically attached to Waller. Around 1905 Ethel renewed her old allegiance to her artist friends and moved to 126 St John's Wood High Street, in the heart of the expanding artist's colony. She was soon employed by her old friend Draper, who made nude studies of her for Day and the Daumstar later in 1905 (PI 7), and the choice of Ethel, the new leading light of the stage, for the personification of a star may have been a joke on Draper's part. Draper noted, beside a drawing of another model in the same pose, that Ethel was more flexible than most of his models. The pose adopted by Ethel in Day and the Daumstar must have been agonising to hold. In the detailed figure drawings for the picture, she stands with her weight on one leg, her spine arched backwards at a striking angle and her head thrown back. In the final picture her back is supported by a virile young sun god, but Draper had not allowed Ethel the pleasure of a young man's arms in his studio. Unlike the other artists, who preferred natural unaffected poses, disported on sofas or reading in armchairs, Draper's sensual art required his models to bend over backwards for him, literally. A year later, in 1906, she posed for her last pictures. Draper's The pearls of Aphrodite (private collection) and Song (present whereabouts unknown). In the former, she posed for the 54</page><page sequence="5">7 Study for Day and the Daumstar by Herbert Draper.

Lady Lever Art Gallery, Port Sunlight principal figure and in the latter she played the role of a singing bacchante. In the same year, Ethel accepted the proposal of marriage from Edmund Waller and they married at the registry office in Marylebone on 24 March. According to John Walker, Whistler was 'in despair when she married and left England. But before she went away he had immortalised her in many nudes in lithographs and pastels'.6 As Walker suggested, Ethel and Edmund left England later in 1906, touring South Africa in Draper's favourite play The Tempest , with William Haviland.7 After returning to England, Ethel took roles in suburban theatre, but in 1908 the Wallers went on tour again for 18 months, to Australia.8 Ethel was in great demand as an actress9 and had to make the decision to devote herself to the stage or the studio. The artists lost her to the actors. After returning to London in 1910, Edmund worked as a stage manager with his father and Ethel (see PI 2) appeared on stage in various melodramatic roles at the Lyceum and Drury Lane.10 In October 1912, she briefly took over the management of the Queen's Theatre,11 opening with Zaza , the play which had brought Ethel and Edmund together. Seasons at the Little Theatre and The Globe in the following year preceded another tour of Australia where she played Lady Gaveston in Sealed Orders. Returning in 1914, she played Miladi in The Three Musketeers at the Lyceum, and in 1915 she played Empress Josephine in A Royal Divorce. The title of the latter play was somewhat prophetic, as Ethel and Edmund divorced later that year.12 In 1920, after further tours of South Africa and Australia, Ethel was established as a highly respected stage actress and joined the New Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-Upon-Avon, where she played challenging roles such as Beatrice, Katherine, Gertrude and Olivia. She remained successful throughout the 1920s and 1930s, but the title of the play in which she performed in September 1923 seems ironic in hindsight. The play was What Money Can Buy. Ethel's expensive tastes eventually caught up with her, and she was forced to recognise that she could no longer live the glamorous life to which she had become accustomed while a member of the Waller dynasty. Her creditors filed a committal order against her at the bankruptcy courts. She owed £200, mostly for dress making bills and, as she only had £3 assets and a wage of £5 per week, she was declared bankrupt.For the next three decades Ethel continued to work on the stage in suburban theatres and even appeared on screen in a number of films in which she played character roles, including Jessie in The Showing Up of Blanco Pösnet. However her great heyday as one of London's finest actresses was over. There were a few highlights in her later career, including a tour in the late 1920s as Mrs Gregory in Mr Wu and Margaret in A Bill of Divorcement. In 1934 she gave an extremely emotive performance as Francesca Noretti in The Life I Gave Him, which impressed the critics: 'She brought all her art to bear on the part and scored a well deserved success,' as her obituary stated.13 She had been a successful artist, model, pin-up and actress, but in the last years of her life she was merely a memory of a past age of whimsical art and melodramatic theatre. Ethel Warwick died in a nursing home in Bognor Regis on 12 September 1951 aged only 68, virtually forgotten and alone. Her obituary celebrated her acting successes but did not mention the important role she played in the art world of Kensington and Chelsea at the turn of the century. Her name was recorded on sketches and in diaries, but few remembered the girl who had once been the friend of the artists and the doyen of the stage. In the last years of Ethel's life, budding starlets such as Norma Shearer and Marilyn Monroe were posing for nude photographs in the hope of being discovered by the likes of Edmund Waller, who had become a successful director in Hollywood working for Paramount and Metro Goldwyn Mayer. They were following the career path taken by Miss Warwick half a century before. Trilby died as she reached the crescendo of an impassioned aria, but for Ethel the song had ceased to resonate, long before. Her death was less mysterious than Monroe's and less dramatic than Trilby's swan-song, but in its own way no less moving.

More bizarre examples include a town in Philadelphia named after the book, brands of soap and sausages, and an ice cream moulded into the shape of the model's famous foot. 2 Although Godward specialised in studies of female beauty, his models almost invariably wore classical togas and had Grecian or Roman names. 3 Whistler was enraged by the character of Sibley and bitterly and publicly recriminated his former comrade. Du Maurier rewrote the offending description when Trilby was published in book form. 4 John Walker, /«mes Abbot McNeil whistler , 1987, pg 115. 5 She exhibited a watercolour at the Royal Society of Artists in 1900. 6 Walker, op cit, p 115. 7 Ethel played Ariel and Edmund had a minor role. 8 They appeared in The Flag Lieutenant , The Sign of the Cross , and Henry of Navarre. 9 In 1907 Ethel accepted the role of FiFi in The Merry Widow at Daly's Theatre and appeared in Hannele at The Scala; and in 1908 she took a part in The Vagabond at The Court. 10 She played Antoinette de Mauban in The Prisoner of Zenda at the Lyceum., Josephine in A Royal Divorce , Miladi in The Three Musketeers , and Iras in Ben Hur at Drury Lane 11 In 1912 she also took a role in Woman and Wine at the Prince's Theatre. 12 He later married the musical actress Marie Blanche, the niece of Ada Blanche the famous pantomime principal boy.
