Bartelt's Accounting Procedures of the United States Government (Public Administration Service, pp. xii, 155, $4.50) consists of a series of papers originally presented to various groups throughout the United States. The treatise is essentially an historical and descriptive discussion</page><page sequence="2">580 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW of the activities of the United States Treasury Department and of the accounting methods used by the United States Government. Although there is some duplication in the background material, the successive chap- ters develop distinct topics and present separate phases of the govern- ment's business or accounting procedures. Subjects dealt with include Treasury functions, the application of mechanical aids in the accounting system, central accounting procedures, administrative accounting for emergency relief expenditures, control of federal expenditures, a plan for integrating the various accounting systems, and fiscal and accounting re- lationships among governmental agencies. The author views the problem of improving the government's accounting system as one phase of the larger problem of administrative management. He suggests, therefore, that the country be divided into twelve or more fiscal districts, in each of which there would be service agencies responsible for the following func- tions: personnel, procurement, collection, disbursement, accounting, and auditing. The agency responsible for auditing would be independent of the executive branch and would be under the direction of the Congress. All the other agencies would constitute a part of the executive organization. The district or branch accounting agencies would exercise general super- vision over the account-keeping functions of all federal activities in the district, maintain summary controlling accounts relating to the financial operation of all federal activities within the district, and render periodic financial reports to Washington for consolidation in a composite financial report for the government as a whole. Mr. Bartelt recognizes the need for integrating our federal accounting system, and his proposals to this end seem both practical and wise. His clear presentation of a highly intricate subject prompts the reviewer to express the hope that the author will ex- plore the subject of federal financial administration more fully in future publications.-MARTIN L. FAUST. Farmers in a Changing World; Yearbook of Agriculture, 1940 (Washing- ton: Government Printing Office, pp. xii, 1215, $1.50) is the fifth in a series of the yearbooks presenting a record of exploration in agriculture as re- lated to humankind. Though the yearbooks since the inception of the pres- ent type of reporting in 1894 have been designed to be of interest chiefly to the farmer, this one, more than any other, views the farmer as a citizen concerned with his occupation as a part of the nation's future. The average citizen may sincerely hope that "explorations along the social and eco- nomic frontiers of agriculture" may be of no less interest to the farmer because of this fact. Instead, it is believed that the farmer's appreciation of the synchronization of his occupational interests with those of others may invite and hold his interest as well, so that our agricultural policy may keep step with the new needs arising from the profound disturb-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 581 ances throughout the world and that there may be a sharpened recogni- tion of interrelationships. This yearbook disclaims any attempt to represent official policy, but invites differences in viewpoints upon the social and economic implications in agriculture. The work consists of three general sections. An excellent one-hundred-page summary is followed by fifty-four articles organized in seven parts dealing with: "The Farmers in a Changing World"; "Agriculture and the National Welfare"; "The Farmer's Problems Today and the Efforts to Solve Them"; "Farm Organ- izations"; "What Some Social Scientists Have to Say"; "Democracy and Agricultural Policy," and is concluded with an appendix presenting a brief "Chronology of American Agricultural History." In the first section, a history of American agriculture provides background for the topics that follow. Maps, charts, footnotes, and a few well chosen bibliographies should prove helpful. Though Henry W. Spiegel's Land Tenure Policies at Home and Abroad (University of North Carolina Press, pp. xii, 171, $3.00) bears a comprehensive title, it is restricted practically to analysis of tenure policies in the United States, England, and Germany, with only brief or incidental reference to France and other Continental states. It is not claimed that the analysis of land tenure policies is conclusive, and this is particularly noticeable in their consideration in the forty-eight states. A careful, detailed analysis of the total impact of state tax laws upon land tenure would be welcome. A more detailed analysis is made of the English and German policies. Numerous tables, generous footnote references, and a well chosen bibliography should prove helpful to the student of the question. The consideration of the effects of institutional and economic factors upon public policies will interest the student of -politics.-H. C. COOK. Through the resources of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Dr. M. H. Satterfield and others have completed a valuable study, based upon gov- ernmental documents and field investigations, entitled County Government and Administration in the Tennessee Valley States (Tennessee Valley Authority, pp. ix, 144, on request). This study outlines the organization and functions of counties, examines their suitability as agencies of ad- ministration, and describes the more important trends in county govern- ment in this region. For example, it takes note of such tendencies as the cessation in the creation of new counties, the concentration of administra- tive authority in some county court, commission, or official, the extension of county liability, and the creation of additional special districts where proprietary functions are assumed. The study emphasizes the fiscal inade- quacy of the county as a unit of government and notes the attempts to seek state and federal aid. Moreover, it points out the sporadic character of systems of real state administrative control. Prophecy as to the future</page><page sequence="4">582 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW goes no farther than a prediction of what may be expected if present trends continue, namely, that there will be increased functional consolidation and a reallocation of functions, with state assumption of those which cannot be performed economically by the counties. The study discusses separately the administrative practices for each service in each of the states, making the treatment somewhat repetitious, yet this plan presents a good com- parative picture and numerous examples of problems peculiar to rural local government. A somewhat fuller discussion of such newer activities as planning, housing, and electric power distribution would have been welcome, and perhaps less objectivity would have given a more realistic appraisal. Nevertheless the study is a definite contribution to the field of rural local government. It is enhanced by eighteen valuable tables, a selected bibliography, and a suitable index.-WILLIAM H. COMBS. Drawing upon his studies for a biography of Mr. Justice Brandeis, Al- pheus T. Mason has incorporated a segment of them in Bureaucracy Con- victs Itself (Viking Press, pp. 224, $2.50). The product is a volume which is more than a fragment struck off from a larger endeavor. It is, in itself, a recreation of what, as Mr. Mason observes, might have become an Amer- ican Dreyfus affair, the Ballinger-Pinchot controversy of 1910. In the main, a piece of straightforward historical narrative, the book represents, in its larger sense, an exhibit for the defense of the democratic processes in their unending opposition to high-handed bureaucracy. The author digs into the baker's dozen of volumes containing the records of the congres- sional investigation of 1910 which explored the dispute resulting in the dis- missal of Louis C. Glavis and Gifford Pinchot from the Department of the Interior. The story, constructed from these and other sources, has a villain-Ballinger, whom the author finds incompetent and vindictive rather than designedly criminal. If there is a hero, it is Glavis, for Mr. Mason allows him more praise than he gives Pinchot. True, a major por- tion of the book describes the tenacity and ingenuity Brandeis displayed throughout the hearings. But the author leaves the full measure of his stature for a later appraisal. Professor Mason gives a bill of particulars against Ballinger from the time he was Commissioner of the General Land Office, in 1907-1908, until he stepped down as Secretary of the Interior in 1911, after the "whitewashing" by the congressional committee's partisan majority. It cites chapter and page against President Taft, Attorney- General Wickersham, and lesser figures in the case. It answers the exoner- ation of Ballinger by Secretary Ickes, who reopened the controversy in a magazine article last year. Because it reads from the records, this book rings true and resets the values of judgment which have lately been some- what dislocated by less thorough investigators. The volume is illustrated with contemporary cartoons. It might have profited from more quotations</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 583 from contemporary newspapers, especially those in- sections of the nation where conservation was a lively issue.-HILTON P. Goss. In every era of reform in the relations between government and society, a time arrives when reform legislation is substantially complete and the more difficult period of administration and enforcement sets in. At this critical turning point, a genuine need arises for a stock-taking literature drawing together by field and function the laws that have come piecemeal from the legislative mills. As one volume in an excellent series designed to portray "American Government in Action," Emanuel Stein's Govern- ment and the Investor (Farrar and Rinehart, Inc., pp. xv, 219, $1.00) meets that need in the field of security finance. In clear and simple narrative, the book covers the four indispensable aspects of the subject: (1) a brief r6sum6 of security flotations and marketing; (2) a description of the con- ditions creating the demand for reform; (3) an exposition of the reform legislation; and (4) the administrative process in action. After describing with admirable brevity the r6le of the corporation and the securities mar- kets in modern economy, the author points up the problems which each have- thrust upon government and investors. This background is sketched with insight and fairness and is free of the emotional furor accompanying reform largely because the data are drawn from the exhaustive investiga- tions of scholars and legislative committees. Against this background, subsequent chapters project the main provisions and detail the operations of the Securities Act (1933), the Securities Exchange Act (1934), the Public Utility Holding Company Act (1935), and the 1940 laws dealing with investment companies and advisers. This drawing together and digesting of diversified legislation is an important service which the author performs skillfully and which the publishers present in excellent format at an incredibly low price. Perhaps, therefore, it is looking the gift horse in the mouth to say that the value of the book would have been increased by an enlargement and more critical discussion of the administration of the laws; and that a bibliography of current materials on this phase of the subject would have made a real contribution.-GEORGE H. E. SMITH. Mayne S. Howard's Principles of Public Finance (Commerce Clearing House, Inc., pp. vii, 438, $4.50) follows the conventional pattern of treatises in this field in that more than three-fourths of the discussion deals with the revenue aspects of public finance. Such topics as expenditures, public budgeting, debts, and problems of war finance are dealt with in brief summary chapters which contribute little to an understanding of these vital subjects. In his treatment of revenues, the author's method is to enumerate in the respective chapters on the different kinds of taxes all the considerations that have been advanced in their favor and all the con-</page><page sequence="6">584 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW siderations advanced against them. There is, in addition, an elaboration and analysis that covers both problems and points of view relevant to the specific type of taxes under discussion. The author has definite convictions as to the kind of tax system we should have. In his foreword, he predicts that the pendulum will swing away from the regimented state, and that Adam Smith's conceptions of government will again prevail. The inte- grated tax system which he outlines for the United States would place chief reliance upon a personal income tax. A property tax on land and a prop- erty tax on improvements on land would be restricted to local govern- ments. Special luxury or consumption taxes on luxuries, particularly on alcoholic beverages and tobacco, should be made as high as their effective administration permits. Taxes on motor vehicles should be as high as the reduction in total transportation costs warrants, and customs revenues should be imposed primarily for revenue. His plan definitely rejects such revenue sources as the following: tangible and intangible personal property taxes, corporation taxes, general sales taxes, special consumption taxes on necessities, business taxes of all kinds, and special assessments. The author is undoubtedly optimistic, and hardly a realist, when he endeavors to devise a tax system on the assumption that the regimented state will fade away. While he is positive in his views on tax matters, it is decidedly to his credit that he proposes in every chapter problems and questions which require further research and study. This is the distinctive and unique feature of the treatise. He has supplied us with excellent suggestions for research in the public finance field. There are no footnotes or bibliograph- ical references of any kind.-MARTIN L. FAUST. Herman Kobbe's Housing and Regional Planning (E. P. Dutton and Co., pp. 233, $3.00) devotes most of its nineteen chapters to the problems of planning and housing as they appear in the New York metropolitan re- gion. The book is well illustrated and provides a mixture of detailed ma- terial on land and housing design and layout with a rather sketchy dis- cussion of several fundamental problems of regionalism, transportation, education, handicraft or mechanical economy, land ownership, etc., which it is suggested can be radically reformed through the medium of a regional planning authority. To the reviewer, the most practical part of the book consists of the detailed material, derived from the author's professional experience as an architect-particularly the plans for various types of multiple dwellings and their layout on available land so as to permit of the most economical use of sunlight, the discussion of the design of stairs and roofs, and the discussion of yards and gardens. Many public adminis- trators and economists would pick practical flaws in the proposed draft of legislation providing for a Metropolitan Regional Land Authority, in the plans for combining education and production, and in the means sug-</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 585 gested for financing the tremendous costs of social-service housing. "The Authority [presumably the author] feels that the deficit in the housing pro- gram should be finally paid for, not by levying higher taxes at all, but by effecting economies in the form of better planning and engineering. Great sums can be saved by elimination of unnecessary travel; by using foresight in the development of a sound land policy; by establishing an adequate wage level and labor schedule in the construction industries; by purchas- ing materials on a system suited to the vast size of the construction pro- gram; and by applying techniques of machine production and prefabrica- tion to the operations of building." In any case, people will enjoy reading Mr. Kobbe's little book, with its practical details and its trenchant criti- cism of current practices. Even its more or less utopian suggestions for re- form of our living patterns will stimulate the imagination and perhaps broaden the perspective of planners, if only they had something to use for money.-C. C. LUDWIG. The second yearbook of the Harvard School of Public Administration, Public Policy (Harvard University Press, pp. viii, 458, $4.00), edited by C. J. Friedrich and C. S. Mason, maintains the high level of the first yearbook. It centers around the fiscal problems of our national govern- ment, although other topics are included. In fact, the excellent opening paper, by Karl R. Bopp, deals with the struggle for power between the French government and the Bank of France. Even this, however, may have relevance to the current fiscal problems of our national government. Papers outside of the field of federal finance include studies of the new an- titrust procedure, by Corwin D. Edwards; the background of the Hatch Act, by Otto Kirchheimer; control of broadcasting in war-time, by C. J. Friedrich; and national defense planning, by 0. L. Nelson. The methods of approach vary as widely as the subjects. An excellent analysis of defi- cit financing by B. Higgins and R. A. Musgrave is an essentially theo- retical discussion. An essay on federal budget procedure by R. H. Rawson is largely descriptive of present practice, although accompanied by a con- structive critical appraisal of procedures. And a study of the effect of fed- eral government expenditures and taxes on the distribution of income, by C. Stauffacher, is primarily a statistical analysis. This last paper delves into an important and neglected field of fiscal research, and it is to be hoped that the author will pursue its further. Other financial studies in- clude two budget papers by Spencer Thompson and H. S. Perloff, a study of government purchasing by A. M. Freiberg, a paper on foregin trade and the business cycle by W. A. Salant, and studies in comparative adminis- tration by Arnold Brecht. It is not to be expected that any essential unity will be achieved in such a series of essays, but taken as a whole these em- phasize the breakdown of the once sharply drawn lines between political</page><page sequence="8">586 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW science and economics and between politics and administration. Most of the authors have been able to draw on all of these fields in so far as they relate to the specific problem in hand; and the resulting reorientation of materials offers a fresh approach and a fertile field for constructive re- search.-MABEL NEWCOMER. In their Michigan Retail Sales and Use Taxes (University of Michigan Press, pp. 154, $0.75), Professor Robert S. Ford and Mr. E. Fenton Shep- ard, of the University of Michigan Bureau of Government, give .a very illuminating presentation of Michigan's experience with these taxes since the former was adopted in 1933 and the latter in 1937. This monograph re- vises, expands, and brings down to June, 1939 (in some cases to March, 1940, but in others only to 1938) Professor Ford's 1936 study of The Retail Sales Tax in Michigan. After an introductory chapter on the recent sales tax movement in the United States, and on types of sales taxes and their incidence, the authors discuss the general features of the Michigan sales tax; administrative problems; comparative practices in other states, par- ticularly Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and California (the last-named is the only one of the five having a general net income tax); financial results; and con- stitutional problems. They then devote a special chapter to the Michigan use tax and a short one to conclusions regarding both taxes. A good bibli- ography and an index enhance the value of the report. For the past several years, Michigan's three per cent retail sales tax has yielded over $50,000,- 000 annually, enough to reduce property tax levies substantially-in fact, sufficient to eliminate such levies for state purposes-and also enough to increase substantially the aids to education and other funds. The use tax has brought in relatively little revenue directly, but it has enabled the state to circumvent much of the difficulty formerly encountered because of federal limitations on the state taxation of interstate commerce. Per- haps the most outstanding and unexpected impressions that the layman will get from this study relate to the great numbers and complexities of administrative and legal difficulties connected with these taxes. This mon- ograph should be very helpful to tax students of all other states as well as to those of Michigan.-Roy G. BLAKEY. Angered by the civil service system forced upon it by an initiated con- stitutional amendment last year, and fearful that Detroit and other cities will force reapportionment upon it by use of the initiative, the Michigan legislature placed on the ballot for the spring election a "constitutional amendment to make it much more difficult to amend the constitution again." Thus The Initiative and Referendum in Michigan (Bureau of Gov- ernment, University of Michigan, pp. 100, $0.50), by James K. Pollock, is timely indeed. The foregoing action of the legislature corroborates the au-</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 587 thor's contention that the legislature is the chief critic of direct legislation in Michigan. Under the headings of history, legal aspects, general results, electoral behavior, and political aspects, he has done a scholarly piece of research and stated his findings concisely with the aid of tables and graphs. He makes repeated comparisons with the experience of other states and concludes that Michigan voters have been sparing in their use of the initiative and referendum, that they have been conservative in their voting on proposals, and that they are satisfied with direct legislation as an institution of popular government and desire its maintenance for their own protection.-O. GARFIELD JONES. Government Purchasing; An Economic Commentary (U. S. Government Printing Office, pp. xix, 330), issued as Monograph No. 19 by the Tem- porary National Economic Committee, makes a most welcome contribu- tion to the limited information available on federal purchasing practices and problems. The study was prepared by Messrs. Copeland, Linnenberg, and Barbour, of the Division of Statistical Standards, Bureau of the Budget. As the authors readily admit in their Introduction, the work falls far short of being a complete picture of federal purchasing. They point to an astounding scarcity of statistical material upon which to base such a study. No one agency gathers statistics on federal purchasing as a whole. The Procurement Division has done so only for the period from Decem- ber, 1937, through June, 1939, and has published the data for the twelve- month period December, 1937-November, 1938. This is included as ap- pendix material in the present study, making up about 165 pages. To com- plicate matters further, the various federal agencies keeping partial rec- ords of federal buying use five different commodity classifications. On the basis of available materials, the monograph discusses the scope and char- acteristics of federal purchasing, evidences of bad timing and collusion, lessons of federal procurement in war-time, and possible improvements. In the latter connection, the point is made that business, and not social considerations, should control in government buying. Among improve- ments suggested are greater use and flexibility of long-term contracts, and governmental production of selected commodities. Brief comments on state and local buying also are included.-CHRISTIAN L. LARSEN. A valuable addition to the critical studies of pressure politics is Econom- ic Power and Political Pressures, which is Monograph No. 26 of the Tem- porary National Economic Committee (Senate Committee Print, U. S. Government Printing Office, pp. ix, 222). It was written by Donald C. Blaisdell, who was loaned to the T. N. E. C. by the Department of Agri- culture. He writes from the double experience of political science teaching and government service, and in making his interpretation he uses aca-</page><page sequence="10">588 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW demic sources as well as official reports. He covers various types and tech- niques of lobbying and lobbyists, including the labor front, government officialdom, and business. He surveys the activities of the large utilities, the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manu- facturers. There is an unwieldy fluctuation in the policy of organized la- bor. Government policy lacks consistency, with changes in parties and personnel. But the author notes that business groups, particularly big business groups, change less in policy through the years and have the superior staying power combined with cohesion, invisibility, resources for pressure, and control over technology. He notes the "stalling" on the de- fense program until business got tax legislation to its liking, and says: "Speaking bluntly, the Government and the public are 'over a barrel' when it comes to dealing with business in time of war or other crises. Busi- ness refuses to work, except on terms which it dictates." These words have found place in labor papers. Mr. Blaisdell would modernize government as a check to the power of big private business. A large assignment!-H. CLARENCE NIXON. The Report of the Attorney General's Committee on Bankruptcy Adminis- tration, 1940 (U. S. Government Printing Office, pp. xvii, 330) contains an exhaustive analysis and appraisal of the actual practice of bankruptcy administration and constructive proposals for modernizing the machinery and processes thereof. The basic materials for the report were obtained by consultation with experienced administrators and organizations having specialized knowledge of bankruptcy, field studies, reports, and exami- nation of numerous cases. The committee found that the substantive mat- ter of the bankruptcy act was adequate for the exigencies of the time, but that the diffusion of responsibility and the lack of centralized supervision in administration frustrated the attainment of the objectives set by the law. In the opinion of the committee, these major defects can be remedied by setting up, in the administrative office of the United States courts, a division of bankruptcy with adequate managerial powers and by creating a corps of full-time salaried referees.-JOHN P. SENNING. Austin F. Macdonald's American City Government and Administration (Thomas Y. Crowell Co., pp. 661, $3.75) is almost unique among text- books on municipal political science because it tries to give comprehensive treatment to problems of administration as well as of politics. Considera- ble success attends the effort in the third edition. In addition to fresh sec- tions on such subjects as housing, welfare, motor parking, public relations, and tax exemption, there are new features such as a tabular analysis of municipal functions and a table of cases. For the most part, the merits of the earlier editions are carried over, among them, for instance, the excel-</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 589 lent chapter on "The Theory of City Government."- Yet a fourth edition could be improved by correcting the facts in the footnote (p. 415) on plan- ning in Chicago, by including the works of Henry George in the bibliogra- phy on planning, and by expanding the section on libraries.-JOHN A. VIEG. The chief contribution of William Hays Simpson's The Small Loan Problem of the Carolinas, with a Commentary on Regulation in Virginia (Presbyterian College Press, pp. 154) is its study of 2,223 small borrowers in the Carolinas. Simple statistical treatment of these borrowers shows their weekly wages, length of time employed, number of dependents, amount and maturity of loans, and average annual interest rates. All these cagegories are classified by race. In later chapters, the author de- scribes small loan offices and other lending agencies. He then describes the futile efforts to establish small loan regulation in the Carolinas, sum- marizes such regulation in other states and finally sketches the creditable system of small-loan regulation in Virginia. There is a bibliography; also an appendix and an index. The book contains useful, yet not unusual or unexpected, information.-GARLAND DOWNUM. Interstate Trade Barriers (H. W. Wilson Co., pp. 215, $1.25) adds an- other to the long list of Reference Shelf compilations previously prepared by Julia E. Johnsen. Articles, testimony presented before the Temporary National Economic Committee, conference addresses, and tax association bulletins supplied the materials included in the work. As this compilation was prepared largely with a view to supplying materials for debates and public discussions, arguments both for and against interstate trade bar- riers are included, as well as historical material and suggestions for the fu- ture handling of the problem. This work is not advanced as an exhaustive study of interstate trade barriers, but it serves a useful purpose in collect- ing in one volume materials not otherwise readily available. The state- ment that a survey, only partially completed, has uncovered 1,489 trade- barrier provisions in the laws of the various states serves to emphasize that this is a present-day major domestic problem.-CHRISTIAN L. LAR- SEN. FOREIGN AND COMPARATIVE GOVERNMENT The wind of Pan Americanism (no cynicism is intended) has been sowed and a whirlwind of books on related topics is being reaped. One of the latest of these is Virginia Prewett's Reportage on Mexico (E. P. Dutton and Co., pp. 332, $3.00). The book is exactly what the title suggests: a reporter's account of current Mexican developments and problems. It is a good book, though not a great one. For a popular account, this study shows a com-</page><page sequence="12">590 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW mendable amount of insight and poise. The chief fault, especially in the early chapters, is one of over-simplification resulting from too much con- densation. There are a few evidences of lack of adequate checking before publication; Mexican proper names are occasionally incorrectly used; and, while the lack of documentation is understandable in a study of this sort, a bibliography would be helpful even in a popular treatment. The large part of the book is devoted to a consideration of problems of the last dec- ade. These are on the whole very intelligently handled. The author makes a valiant, and generally successful, effort to untangle the confused skein of Mexican political alignments. In much of her analysis she leans mildly to the left, although in the chapter on the 1940 election her position is strongly pro-Almazan; this position, it might be remarked without prej- udice to her conclusion, appears based on too narrow a sampling of evi- dence. The chapter on Trotsky's assassination is brought in without suffi- cient articulation with the main thread of the story, but is a worth-while discussion in itself. The final chapter has a very well done analysis of Mex- ican strategic considerations, the development of the army, Nazi infiltra- tion, and related topics. The author correctly emphasizes the importance of economic factors in Mexican politics and arrives, withal, at a gloomy conclusion in regard to the country's economic future.-RuSSELL H. FITZGIBBON. In view of the probability that steadily increasing governmental control over both the recording and dissemination of objective data regarding in- ternal conditions in Japan will make it perhaps impossible before long for anyone to get such facts, Hugh Borton's Japan Since 1931; Its Political and Social Developments (I.P.R. Inquiry Series, International Secretariat, Institute of Pacific Relations, pp. xii, 139, $1.25) is a book which badly needed to be written. Into its brief pages the author has packed a mass of carefully documented material not to be found elsewhere in such small compass; material which will grow increasingly important, as sources dry up, not only for those interested in the political, economic, and social de- velopments of Japan during a crucial decade, but for everyone concerned with the how and why of totalitarianism as a way of life. Source materials available to the author have been conscientiously explored and used. One's natural regret over the dearth of direct reference to materials in the Japa- nese language is softened by the knowledge that in Japan approved trans- lations of the more important documents were, for the period covered, fairly well available, and that virtually all writings by Japanese in foreign languages had to have official approval. Under these circumstances, it is doubtful whether any fair-minded Japanese would challenge the facts as presented. In the way of supplementary comment and speculation, the author has been extremely frugal, but perhaps for this very reason all the</page><page sequence="13">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 591 more effective. The reader can readily draw his own conclusions to supple- ment those which the author so sparingly presents.-ERNEST B. PRICE. Scholarship is put to strange uses when it offers its results under a mis- leading label designed to attract attention through appeals to momentary and superficial viewpoints. The Decline of French Democracy; The Begin- ning of National Disintegration, by Mary E. Weyer (American Council on Public Affairs, Washington, pp. 73, $1.50), is simply an investigation of French politics and government during a part of the year 1914. In a short Introduction, Andr6 Maurois attempts to answer the question, "Why then was the final result a victory in 1918, a defeat in 1940?" The little volume begins with an analysis of the Chamber elections of April and May, 1914, proceeds through chapters on the assassination of Jaures, mobilization, war legislation, union sacr6e, military events, censorship and the press, and ends with the flight to Bordeaux. In other words, it covers events from the end of April to the middle of September, 1914. The treatment of these events is good, but by no means exhaustive. The reviewer, however, finds nothing in this treatment to support the volume's title, and certainly noth- ing to challenge Renouvin's conclusion of 1925 that "among the great belligerent states, France was indeed that one which . .. remained most faithful to its traditions and to its constitutional principles."-J. G. HEINBERG. Frieda Wunderlich's British Labor and the War (New School for Social Research, pp. 67, $0.40) examines the whole question of British Labor's relation to the present conflict. The brochure is divided into two parts- the first concerned with the recruitment and allocation of labor; the sec- ond, with such aspects as stoppages and hours of work, wages, social serv- ices, social conditions, trade unionism, and war, and the political attitude of Labor. The author shows that Great Britain has lagged far behind Ger- many in systematic industrial training for the war; that the program of slum clearance has practically ceased because of the conflict; that school- ing of thousands of children has become very meager; and that, quoting Clara Rackham, standards for child-labor "have melted like snow in a few months." Despite the admitted dangers which war has in store for the la- bor movement and democratic control, Miss Wunderlich concludes that, while "the framework of British war planning may be totalitarian, ... the spirit remains democratic."-MULFORD Q. SIBLEY. In England Speaks (Macmillan Co., pp. 222, $1.75), A. P. Herbert, A. A. Milne, E. M. Forster, A. S. Duncan-Jones, Ronald Knox, J. R. Clynes, C. E. M. Joad, and Harold Laski defend the British position in the present conflict. Several of the essays are well done. One is particularly impressed,</page><page sequence="14">592 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW for example, by Clynes's vivid contrast between the individualistic, shod- dy England of his boyhood and the embryonic service state of today. One is moved by Laski's picture of the "Rights of Man" and his denunciation of their negation in contemporary Germany. But the fundamental ques- tion is evaded by the authors: while showing with considerable clarity why they believe that the British way of life is worth defending, they assume without argument that war will perform the task. They demonstrate the reality of British social progress, but the crucial problem of war's efficacy as a means of defense is almost totally ignored. This war is one "for civili- zation," according to Professor Joad, or for "the Nazarene," according to Father Knox; but no endeavor is made to prove that war can in fact either save "civilization" or rescue Christ. The future American Commit- tee on Public Information might find this book helpful in its conscription of intellectuals.-MULFORD Q. SIBLEY. In A Selected List of Books and Articles on Japan in English, French, and German (American Council of Learned Societies, pp. 142, $1.50), Hugh Borton, Serge Elisseeff, and Edwin 0. Reischauer have compiled a very helpful and critical bibliography of works dealing with the humanities and the social sciences with respect to Japan. Any academic institution desir- ing to build up a working library on Japan will find this bibliography in- dispensable. The comprehensiveness of the bibliography is indicated by the fact that in the field of Japanese history and politics there are some 235 titles, most of which are evaluated by the compilers. The Committee on Japanese Studies of the American Council of Learned Societies is to be congratulated upon publishing so valuable a guide.-WILLIAM BALLIS. INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS The peace r6le of organized labor during the first World War and la- bor's unsuccessful efforts to secure a "people's peace" at Versailles are de- lineated in scholarly fashion by Austin Van der Slice in his International Labor, Diplomacy, and Peace, 1914-1919 (University of Pennsylvania Press, pp. 408, $4.00). This thoroughly documented study fills competent- ly a serious gap in the voluminous literature on this period. It will be wel- comed by all students of labor and international relations. Happily, Pro- fessor Van der Slice has avoided the common error of assuming that the losing side in any controversy relinquishes thereby its claim to historical significance. He persuasively demonstrates that "it is the political pro- gram which labor failed to put across that historically will loom as the most important." The author has meticulously set forth the war aims of international labor and the objectives of labor groups in France, Great Britain, and the United States. He relates the hitherto obscure story of the gradual development by labor of a concerted and internationally</page><page sequence="15">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 593 directed peace policy and labor's increasing militancy in urging this pro- gram upon the Allied governments. The study shows that Wilson's Four- teen Points were substantially a recapitulation of peace terms already formulated by labor, and also demonstrates that Wilson's public diplo- macy up to the Armistice was consonant with earlier policies of organized labor. In addition to developing its own peace program, labor throughout the war was prodding the governments to define their war aims. Van der Slice describes the techniques by which labor attempted to pave the way for a peace based not on victory but upon democratic negotiation. Labor's weapons were political pressure and the influencing of public opinion. Ac- cording to Van der Slice, labor's failure should not minimize the impor- tance of its effort, nor hide the fact that at the War's end labor was the only organized political group with a clear-cut peace program. Perhaps the best chapters are those in which the author recounts labor's tactics during the period between the Armistice and Versailles and the efforts of labor to mold public opinion in favor of the Wilsonian peace program. Labor's unsuccessful "Lobbying at Paris" is discussed fully in the con- cluding chapter. Worthy of particular attention is a twenty-one page bibliography that should prove invaluable to students of labor's peace ac- tivities.-HAROLD W. DAVEY. Professor G. H. Bousquet has written a penetrating and provocative study of Dutch rule in the East Indies. He has also investigated French administration in North Africa and British rule in India, and his descrip- tions of Dutch policy are often illumined by contrasts with French and British practice. M. Bousquet emphasizes that his conclusions are based upon a residence of only five months in the Indies. He seems to have been a shrewd observer, and A French View of the Netherlands Indies (Oxford University Press, pp. ix, 133), is a realistic portrayal of the actual working of Dutch colonial government. He gives high praise to what Holland has done to raise the standard of living. At the same time, he concludes that she does not propose to surrender control of the empire to Indonesian na- tionalists, who number only a few hundred thousand intellectuals and ur- ban workmen out of the 60,000,000 in the East Indies. The same situation existed in India twenty-five years ago; but the Dutch and British policies have been diametrically opposite. The British felt it to be their duty to provide every facility for Western education so far as the inadequate rev- enue allowed; and since 1919 they have also tried to conciliate the Indian nationalists by granting self-government in large instalments. The policy of the Dutch has been to discourage Western education, while promoting elementary education in the native languages. On the political side, they have combined the arrest of pronounced nationalists with a very limited instalment of self-government in the Volksraad. This body is reminiscent</page><page sequence="16">594 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW of the legislatures established in India in 1909 by the Liberal government. They combined an immovable executive with an untrammelled popular opposition; and they converted the Indian nationalists into an irresponsi- ble opposition who had unlimited power of criticism and no hope or risk whatever that they would have to assume the responsibilities of office. M. Bousquet feels that in the end the Volksraad will produce the same results as its British predecessor.-LENNox A. MILLS. In his Diplomatic Relations of the United States with Haiti, 1776-1891 (University of North Carolina Press, pp. xi, 516, $5.00), Rayford W. Lo- gan presents a comprehensive study of the policy of the United States to- ward the Negro republic which was set up in America on French founda- tions. In preparing this monograph, the industrious author sought for ma- terials in a variety of manuscript collections, public and private. Appar- ently neither he nor his agent utilized the important papers long preserved at the Quai d'Orsay entitled Correspondance Politique, Haiti. The book be- gins with a consideration of conditions existing in Saint-Domingue be- fore Toussaint Louverture emerged upon the stage. Among other topics, the author sketches the history of Haiti in the early nineteenth century, touches rather lightly upon the recognition of the independence of Haiti by the government of Charles X, notices the conflict of interest between the Negro republic and the Dominican republic, describes in some detail the recognition of Haitian independence by President Lincoln, and dis- cusses the designs of foreign powers upon Mole St. Nicolas, with special attention to the attempt of the United States to secure a lease of that Gibraltar of America. The narrative is enlivened by quotations from rare or unedited sources and interspersed with striking observations. Though special students of this field of international relations may occasionally disagree with the author's comments, all investigators of the history of the insular republics will find the monograph useful. A bibliography of thirty- six pages constitutes the most extensive and up-to-date list of materials concerning an insular American republic that has yet been made available to scholars.-WILLIAM SPENCE ROBERTSON. In his World-Wide Influences of the Cinema; A Study of Official Censor- ship and the International Cultural Aspects of Motion Pictures (University of Southern California Press, pp. xvi, 320), John E. Harley emphasizes the motion picture as a means of creating better understanding between nations. He describes a number of the chief organizations interested in the peaceful services of this medium, and analyzes recent efforts to aid them, through lowering tariff barriers on films and by other means. On the negative side, he recognizes that certain films arouse ill-will. The vol- ume deals with the problem so raised, by reviewing the efforts of official and occasional unofficial censors, located all over the globe, to check the</page><page sequence="17">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 595 distribution of foreign films deemed offensive to their countrymen or to third parties. Written in the closing months of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, the volume is mainly descriptive of the conditions prevailing just prior to the present war, as typified by the assistance rendered to the dis- tributors of educational films by the League of Nations. To some extent, however, the text does cover current problems, such as the decline in American film exports brought about by hostilities in Europe, and the tightening of news-reel censorship by the belligerent powers. Harley ex- presses the hope that this disturbed situation will soon be replaced by an era when films can again carry the spirit of peace throughout the globe. Much of the volume consists of quotations from current literature or original material obtained directly from censors stationed in other lands, interspersed with somewhat limited comments by the author. Though the volume is essentially a detailed compilation, it throws so much light on the international flow of ideas as to make it excellent reading.-WILLIAM BEARD. If Canada and the United States are viewed as a whole, they constitute another "British Isle" because of their common topography, their com- mon culture, their common economic ideas, their common devotion to democracy, and their common need of an island military strategy. Thus a new and challenging perspective intrigues the reader of F. R. Scott's Canada and the United States (World Peace Foundation, pp. 80, $0.50). The Ogdensburg Agreement of August 17, 1940, establishing a permanent Canadian-American Defense Commission, added another piece of admin- istrative machinery to bind the destinies, not only of two great neighbor nations, but also of two great commonwealths-namely, the British Com- monwealth of Nations and the Pan-American Union. Indeed, the author's theme centers upon the far-reaching implications of the Ogdensburg Pact. It is Dr. Scott's contention that such a military plan must inevitably in- volve an economic plan and a political plan for all of North America; that such a plan for North America, in its turn, involves for the United States the assumption of interests and responsibilities throughout the globe, and for Canada, the assumption of interests and responsibilities in the whole of the western hemisphere-a reciprocation of interests heretofore not en- tertained. Truly in pushing the frontiers of the future, this book justifies its place in the series "America Looks Ahead." Written by a Canadian who is master of his subject, who understands Americans, and who is deft at the art of interpreting his people to them, this book is worthy of serious contemplation and wide circulation.-FRANCES REINHOLD FUSSELL. In The Struggle for North China (I. P. R. Inquiry Series, International Secretariat, Institute of Pacific Relations, pp. xiv, 247, $2.00), George E. Taylor throws much light upon the failure of the Japanese to solve in three</page><page sequence="18">596 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW and a half years, an "Incident" which they expected to conclude in three months. During the first two years of the present war, Professor Taylor, who is now head of the department of Oriental studies at the University of Washington, was professor of political science at Yenching University in Peiping. His conclusions are thus based, in part, upon personal observa- tions in territories under Chinese control as well as in areas under Japa- nese occupation. The struggle which he describes is not merely-or even primarily-that of armed forces; it is the underlying political and econom- ic struggle in which a hastily improvised Chinese administration-the Border Government of Hopei, Shansi, and Chahar-has been blocking the efforts of a Japanese-sponsored Provisional Government at Peiping to govern and exploit in the interest of Japan the invaded Northern prov- inces. In July, 1937, when the "China Incident" started at Lukouchiao, these provinces were politically the most backward part of China; Japa- nese pressure since 1935 had effectively excluded all efforts at reform, and the peasants "hated the very name of government." To foreign observers, it was unthinkable that this population could be so organized as to offer serious resistance to Japanese plans. By the following March, however, the organization of the rural districts under the Border Government was an accomplished fact, and since that date Japan's puppet regime at Pei- ping has been an almost total loss. "The main fact that stands out in this struggle for government is that the Japanese had no political weapons which were of any value to them among people not under their immediate military control . .. they relied not on law but on spies, not on political obligation but on political subjugation, not on good will but on terrorism ... On the other hand, ... the principles and policies of the Border Gov- ernment afford one of the finest historical examples of the approximation of political means to political ends" (pp. 95-98).-G. NYE STEIGER. Democracy is government by talk. Wherever democracy survives, pub- lic policy is arrived at by discussion. Whether any particular democracy, or democracies in general, shall or shall not perish from the earth depends largely upon whether public discussion is relevant and rational, and is fol- lowed by decision and action. Ever since the publication of The Great Il- lusion a generation ago, Norman Angell has made notable contributions to the relevancy and rationality of public discussion of international affairs, both in England and in America. His latest book-America's Dilemma: Alone or Allied? (Harper and Brothers, pp. x, 226, $1.75)-exhibits his best qualities at their best: incisive analysis of issues, admirable lucidity of thought, singular cogency of reasoning, and a unique persuasiveness flowing from a rare felicity of expression. These ten chapters are addressed to Americans in general and to isolationists in particular. Sir Norman as- sumes that political animals, including Americans, can learn from experi-</page><page sequence="19">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 597 ence, including that of Europeans. His second chapter, with appropriate quotations from Lindbergh, Beard, Upton Close, and other apostles of "minding our own business," is the best brief statement of the isolationist position which this reviewer has ever encountered. The remaining chap- ters are the most closely reasoned refutation of that position which has yet appeared. Item by item, the author punctures current hallucinations. Point by point, he states the case for aid to Britain and for American lead- ership in world reconstruction. This is more than a tract for the times, however, for it is rich in penetrating insights and in shrewd characteriza- tions of persons and peoples. Sir Norman is a political scientist and a social psychologist as well as a propagandist. America's Dilemma therefore de- serves the careful attention of academicians as well as of citizens in general. -FREDERICK L. SCHUMAN. Although Dollars in Latin America; An Old Problem in a New Setting (Council on Foreign Relations, pp. vii,- 102, $1.50), by Willy Feuerlein and Elizabeth Hannan, presents few facts unfamiliar to the specialist in inter- American relations, it nevertheless is a convenient summary of the invest- ments of United States citizens in Latin America and the problems aris- ing from them. It also contains a number of suggestions regarding econom- ic and diplomatic procedure-suggestions which harmonize for the most part with recent phases of the Good Neighbor policy: loans for construc- tive purposes under joint management, credits to ease exchange difficul- ties, and plans for the disposal of surplus commodities. The main problems are lack of Old World markets and economic nationalism in Latin Amer- ica. The volume is sane and impartial; the authors appreciate and discuss both sides of the problems that have arisen. One phase of the subject which they largely neglected, however, may be of greater importance than the authors have realized, namely, the record of the investment bankers of the United States in the 1920's. The truth, if set forth fully and judi- ciously, probably would be on the whole helpful in the development of har- monious relations. In this reviewer's opinion, many Americans, both North and South, have generalized too freely on the basis of certain in- stances of bribery and excessive profits. A sober narrative of the whole story-with due attention to bond issues previously distributed in Euro- pean markets-would correct misconceptions and possibly change atti- tudes in respect to both government bonds and direct investments. The whole subject demands fuller treatment.-J. FRED RIPPY. Described on its title-page as a "compilation of facts," any criticism of The European Possessions in the Caribbean Area (American Geographical Society, pp. v, 112, $1.00) for its analytical shortcomings is largely beside the point. The four authors, Raye R. Platt, John K. Wright, John C.</page><page sequence="20">598 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Weaver, and Johnson E. Fairchild, sought "to bring together in conven- ient form factual information needed for following the news while the need for such information is still pressing" (p. v). This useful volume contains data on the population, physical geography, resources, industries, trade, government, and strategic importance of these possessions. The six-page "list of references" only emphasizes the need for the present publication by demonstrating the unsatisfactory state of the literature on the subject. Doubtless reflecting the professional interest of the authors, the volume allots space more generously to geographic than to political data. The ma- terial is arranged by sovereignties involved. This classification would be well-suited to a volume emphasizing colonial policy, but obscures the geo- graphic similarities of such areas as British Guiana, French Guiana, and Surinam. Comparative tables would permit much of the statistical data to be more readily grasped. Especially useful for political scientists is the es- say on the strategic importance of these colonies.-WILLIAM T. R. Fox. If, as someone once remarked, in times of peace we prepare for war, the corollary is no less true that in times of war we ought to prepare for peace. And Georges Kaeckenbeeck's De la Guerre d la Paix (Publications de L'Institut Universitaire de Hautes Etudes Internationales, No. 22, Ge- nbve, Suisse, p. 101) is only one of the many volumes dealing with the subject of peace after war which must inevitably flood the book marts. Here in five short chapters Professor Kaeckenbeeck views the subject not only from the standpoint of abstract theory but also with some special regard to such historical facts as the Hague Conventions, the Treaty of Versailles, the Stimson Doctrine, etc. Although, to be sure, this study has endeavored to treat the matter in its more general implications, it does not altogether do away with the feeling, as indeed it should not, that it might well serve as a guide for those charged, or to be charged, with the estab- lishment of peace after the present war. And if to this be added the au- thor's own fitness and competence to deal with such a subject, the useful- ness of such a book becomes indeed great.-BENJAMIN MUNN ZIEGLER. As a contribution to the fiftieth anniversary of the Pan American Union, the Carnegie Endowment has brought out The International Conferences of American States: First Supplement, 1933-1940 (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, pp. xxix, 558, $3.50). It is a collection of official docu- ments of the principal Pan American conferences since 1933, and brings up to date a similar collection published in 1931 for the conferences from 1889 to 1928. There are also valuable appendices which summarize data, hither- to not readily available, for the 159 technical and special conferences which have taken place since 1891 and for the 73 commissions and other bodies which have been set up. An index of persons and a subject-index complete the volume.-JAMEs T. WATKINS IV.</page><page sequence="21">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 599 POLITICAL THEORY AND MISCELLANEOUS "When political philosophy is produced in quantities," says George H. Sabine in the introduction to his excellent edition of The Works of Gerrard Winstanley (Cornell University Press, pp. 686, $5.00), it is a sure symptom that society is going through a period of stress and strain." This he holds true of the period in which Winstanley wrote, which he characterizes as a time in which all the intellectual, religious, moral, social, and political traditions were broken apart and put together in a new pattern. He cites as symptomatic of "what was taking place" and "as a sign for the future" the treatises of Hobbes, Harrington, and a little later of Locke, as well as the great mass of popular writing of which, along with those of the Level- lers, the works of Winstanley are significant examples. The editor, as did Gooch before him, refers to Winstanley's doctrine and the Digger move- ment as communistic, a designation perhaps justified by the program for the collective tilling of the common land and the suggestion of the ulti- mate nationalization of all land and all means of production. Winstanley's program and his philosophy, however, had about it essentially little of later Marxian communism. In it there is no place for economic determin- ism nor for violence. Necessary changes were to be effected directly or indi- rectly through the spirit of universal love operating in the heart of man. Unlike Marxism, also, his program included a plan for an ultimate politi- cal commonwealth. Though a note of irrationalism is struck in the insist- ence on the Inner Light, the " 'incomprehensible spirit' from which the creation flowed and which continually works in it," this very insistence in- dicates a marked difference from communistic materialism and imparts to Winstanley's doctrine something much more akin to the present demo- cratic emphasis on the dignity of man. Indeed, so fundamental are the problems plumbed and so universal is the genius of Winstanley, that whether one accepts his solutions or not, his writings are replete with sig- nificance for the present crisis, and show him worthy of the labor expended in the production of this admirable companion piece to Woodhouse's recent edition of the Army Debates.-ELLEN DEBORAH ELLIS. In Technology and Society (The Macmillan Co., pp. xiv, 474, $3.00), S. Mckee Rosen and Laura Rosen survey the economic, social, and politi- cal effects of recent technological developments on our institutional life. After a foreword by Professor Louis Wirth and an introductory chapter on "National Policy and Technology," the authors proceed with a popular description of technological advances in manufacturing, transportation and communication, agriculture, construction, and the professions. The remainder of the book is devoted, in a part for each, to a description of the economic, social, and political effects of these developments. The recur- rent theme emphasizes the need for planned social action, based not only</page><page sequence="22">600 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW on the present application of modern inventions, but likewise on those in- ventions not yet applied which may produce revolutionary effects on our way of life and on our institutions. Though such planning is both neces- sary and desirable, the authors give ample attention to the forms of resist- ance to change on the part of groups largely affected by new inventions and by the general public. The national government is called upon to as- sume leadership in planning, even though jurisdictional obstacles impair the effective application of any broad plan. A contrast is drawn between regional planning by the method of interstate cooperation as evidenced in the Port Authority of New York and the Ohio River Sanitation Com- pact, and by the national government in the T. V. A. program. The selec- tion of these and other examples suggests methods which governmental units have developed to meet the challenge of technology. Well selected tables, charts, and pictographs based on statistical data of recent vintage add to the value of the book. As a text for the student taking but a single course in social science, this book deserves serious consideration.-JOHN D. TOMLINSON. In The Devolopment of Religious Toleration in England; Attainment of the Theory and Accommodations in Thought and Institutions, 1640-1660 (Harvard University Press, pp. 499, $5.00), the fourth in a series of books, W. K. Jordan brings to a close his scholarly and authoritative study of the growth of religious toleration in England. The whole series covers the pe- riod from the Reformation to the Restoration. The present volume deals with lay and moderate thought on the subject of religious toleration dur- ing the two revolutionary decades, and with the re-orientation of Anglican and Roman Catholic thought under the impact of militant sectarianism. The author concludes that "the theory of religious toleration stood sub- stantially complete in 1660," and that the reaction which set in during the first decade of the Restoration merely delayed the "process of accom- modating institutions" to the principle generally accepted by "the respon- sible and sober thought of the nation." In the last chapter, Professor Jor- dan, by way of summary to the four books in the series, points out the causes of the development of religious toleration and appraises the changes which it involved. Since the author, in presenting the individual contribu- tions to the theory of toleration, gives little attention to their relation to the general intellectual, social, and political trends of the time, the chief value of the volume is its utility as a reference book.-HENRY JANZEN. F. C. Bartlett's Political Propaganda (Cambridge: At the University Press; New York: The Macmillan Co., pp. 158, $1.25), the first of a series of studies of current problems under the general editorship of Ernest Barker, is a concise analysis of the troublesome problem of propaganda.</page><page sequence="23">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 601 Intended as a summarization for the general reader rather than an ex- haustive scientific treatise, Political Propaganda will repay the more seri- ous student for a careful reading. Professor Bartlett, a psychologist, avoids the obfuscations frequently characteristic of his profession. To the author, "propaganda is an organized and public form of the process ... [of] sug- gestion." Though he does not commit himself definitely upon how far propaganda may appeal to the rational as well as the emotional nature of man, it is implicit in his argument that he thinks reason as well as emotion plays a significant r6le in propaganda. "He who despises and underrates human instincts and emotions will be ineffective. It is equally true that he who despises and underrates human intelligence will himself, with greater certainty year by year, be despised (p. 103)." Mr. Bartlett refutes the Hitlerian view that constant repetition is the best propaganda since the masses are completely stupid. The tiny volume is an objective warning against absolute statements and easy generalizations concerning human nature and the ability to persuade men to any position simply by employ- ing subtle or magnificent falsehoods. There is no magic to propaganda, no mesmerism based upon some esoteric knowledge of the black art. Un- doubtedly propaganda has been much over-propagandized and is sadly in need of being debunked. Intelligent books like Political Propaganda should be prophylactic as well as curative.-JASPER B. SHANNON. Mr. Charles E. Carpenter is a man with a message about a near-panacea which he explains in Private Enterprise and Democracy (Longmans, Green and Co., pp. 217, $2.50). Mr. Carpenter's intentions are good; his heart is in the right place; and many of his ideas are pertinently looking in the right direction. The thesis may be stated briefly. The disparity between general consumer spending and savings is one of the fundamental defects of our current economy. This disparity arises from an abuse of the cor- porate form of business, from shortsighted business price policies, from poorly designed tax laws, from an uncritical acceptance of saving as an unalloyed virtue. Mr. Carpenter, properly enough, distinguishes between over-saving and over-investment, both in his analysis and in his proposed remedies. To correct this central difficulty, Mr. Carpenter suggests a co- operative form of profit-sharing in which labor, management, and stock- holders all share the risks and the gains. He has been strongly influenced, apparently, by the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company plan. With some ancillary devices and the exception of agriculture, he thinks this cooperative scheme may be generally applied in the business-industrial world. Corollary parts of his plan include wholesale overhauling of the tax system, with income, estate, and gift taxes dominating the resulting structure-all to be col- lected by the federal government; by constitutional amendment, the president should be empowered to oblige either house of the Congress re-</page><page sequence="24">602 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW jecting a presidential proposal to stand for election; and finally some means must be found to improve the population on a eugenic basis. To the informed person, the book contributes little; to the uninformed, it is likely to be misleading because of the engulfing lacunae in both logic and infor- mation.-HARVEY PINNEY. To believe the absurd is the true test of faith among all fanatics, eccle- siastical and political. No myth of our time is more absurd than the myth of "race," nor more insane and hideous in its social consequences. No myth is adhered to with more stubborn devotion. Social scientists and laymen alike must therefore find answers to such questions as: What is race? What is scientifically known about racial differences? What generali- zations are warranted from the data? What is believed about race and why, and wherein are the beliefs true or false? These questions and a host of others are answered by Ruth Benedict in Race: Science and Politics (New York: Modern Age Books, pp. ix, 274, $2.50). The first part of her latest work is a lucid and brilliant summation of what modern anthropologists know, and do not know, about race. The second part is a r6sum6 and critique of the principal doctrines of "racism." Professor Benedict justly observes: "No travesty of anthropomorphic facts is too startling for prop- aganda to announce if the propaganda is backed by force of arms and con- centration camps." Not least among the merits of this excellent study are the concise quotations from anthropologists and racists alike ("What They Say") at the close of each of the eight chapters, and the compilation of recent resolutions of scientific associations on the subject. The closing chapter, "Why Then Race Prejudice?," has implications which states- men, social psychologists, and students of politics would do well to take to heart: "To understand race persecution, we do not need to investigate race; we need to investigate persecution. . . . To understand race conflict, we need fundamentally to understand conflict and not race.... Whatever reduces conflict, curtails irresponsible power, and allows people to obtain a decent livelihood will reduce race conflict. Nothing less will accomplish the task."-FREDERICK L. SCHUMAN. Professor T. J. Haarhoff, author of The Stranger at the Gate; Aspects of Exclusiveness and Co6peration in Ancient Greece and Rome, with Some Reference to Modern Times (Longmans, Green and Co., pp. 140), is a Boer with a British education. In this book it is his endeavor to apply the experience of Graeco-Roman civilization to the contemporary racial and cultural problems of the Union of South Africa. South Africa, like the Roman Empire, is composed of two separate cultural and linguistic con- stituents. Professor Haarhoff examines the relations between the Greeks and the Romans from the time when the two cultures first established</page><page sequence="25">BOOK REVIEWS AND NOTICES 603 direct contact with each other until they blended together into the cos- mopolitan civilization of the Roman Empire and attempts to deduce from this examination what lessons there may be that can be profitably applied in South Africa today. The author has read widely both in the ancient authors and in the standard modern works. His conclusions are always intelligent, though rarely profound. It is, of course, quite impossible for an American reviewer to determine in how far Professor Haarhoff has succeeded in achieving his aim, that is to say, whether in fact his country- men, Boers and British, will feel that his book has contributed to a solu- tion of the problems which face them. One point, however, must be men- tioned. The Graeco-Roman civilization of the Roman Empire had no internal problem even remotely analogous to the vast Negro population of the Union of South Africa. And it is precisely the kaffirs whom Pro- fessor Haarhoff to all intents and purposes completely disregards. This omission gives his book an air of unreality.-CHARLES EDSON. In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the dedication of the Social Science Research Building at the University of Chicago, the social scien- tists there invited colleagues elsewhere to meet with them in December, 1939, for addresses and round-table discussions on questions of method and scope in the social sciences. The papers, and summaries of the dis- cussions, have been edited by Dr. Louis Wirth and published by the Uni- versity of Chicago Press in a volume entitled Eleven Twenty-Six (pp. xv, 498, $3.50). The title is taken from the address of the building, 1126 East 59th St. A bibliography of writings during the decade by social scientists then affiliated with the University comprises about two hundred pages of the volume. While much of the discussion recorded reflects the indecisive and inconclusive aspects of talk about scope and method, the cumulative and corporate achievement of the social scientists thus physically housed together so advantageously, and frequently engaged upon cooperative projects related to the local community and region, emerges clearly. Political scientists will join in congratulating their colleagues in "1126" on their accomplishments during the first decade and in extending good wishes for continued success in their collaboration with other social scien- tists in the future.-JOHN M. GAUS. The compilation, Constitutional Chaff-Rejected Suggestions of the Con- stitutional Convention of 1787, with Explanatory Argument (Columbia Uni- versity Press, pp. 197, $2.25), by Jane Butzner, is timely. It is illuminating to reexamine the discussions which engaged the Founding Fathers. Under each of the Constitution's provisions are set forth the plans which would have replaced or modified it and the arguments in their favor. The author hopes that "this book will be liked by those who enjoy speculating, for</page><page sequence="26">604 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW example, on the course of our government if the Constitution had pro- vided that the Senate sit constantly and have full authority over foreign affairs-in other words, by those who read for entertainment" (Preface). More, however, than entertainment is presented. Two appendices show, respectively, what the authors of the Constitution said about judicial review and about a limitation on the number of terms for the president. A third appendix quotes from Major William Pierce's character sketches of the Convention delegates. The book is without documentation. The source used was Documents Illustrative of the Formation of the Union of the American States (House Document No. 398, 69th Congress, 1st Session). The author has found much interesting "chaff," and such a volume should have been printed long ago.-MONA FLETCHER. Philip Davidson's Propaganda and the American Revolution (University of North Carolina Press, pp. xvi, 460, $4.00) contains a great wealth of material gathered from original sources and woven into a history of the propaganda of the period. There are quotations from preachers, pam- phleteers, newspaper editors, poets, and plain agitators. The quotations have been taken from so many sources and something has been said about so much that at least one reader ended with the feeling that the author would have left a clearer picture if he had given longer excerpts from fewer sources and had discussed them more thoroughly. In the light of our in- terest in contemporary war propaganda, it is interesting to find clergymen and college presidents presented as among the most active war propa- gandists of the Revolutionary era. Glittering generalities and name-calling were devices useful then as now. The patriot champions of freedom did not hesitate to suppress opposition newspapers and to hush Tory clergy- men by force. Mr. Davidson's evidence of the propaganda superiority of the promoters of the Revolution over the Tories does not lead to new conclusions, but it does contribute to a better understanding of the nature of that superiority.-CHARLES W. SMITH, JR. The perplexing problem for text writers in the field of economic regula- tion is the constantly changing content of legislation and significant ad- ministrative developments. Charles C. Rohlfing, Edward W. Carter, Bradford W. West, and John G. Hervey have attempted to meet this difficulty by successive editions of their Business and Government (Founda- tion Press, Inc., pp. xvi, 803, $4.00). The fourth edition is now available. The changes introduced have not altered significantly the previous quali- ties of the volume. The new legislation and court decisions have been added to the pertinent chapters. The chapter on "The Constitution of the United States" has been dropped, and a chapter on "War and Business" added.

The chapter, "The Control of Unfair Trade Practices," has become "Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection," and now includes food and drug legislation. There is no dis- cussion of the regulation of insurance. It is a little annoying to have Chief Justice Marshall's aphorism on the power of taxation misquoted.- CHARLES B. HAGAN. A very valuable corrective for an over-simplified interpretation of the internationalism of Karl Marx appears in Solomon F. Bloom's The World of Nations; A Study of the National Implications in the Work of Karl Marx (Columbia University Press, pp. 225, $2.50). Mr. Bloom stresses Marx's willingness to acknowledge the importance of nations as facts, his em- phasis upon national differences and national traditions (which went so far as to modify substantially the application of his general analysis to such a country as Russia), his emphasis upon the national class (the class which leads a particular nation along the line of progress), his classification of nations in terms of their progress and capacity for progress, and his acceptance of a limited number of large nations as the basis of an ultimate socialist system. Mr. Bloom's study is comprehensive, objective, and generously documented; he is successful in relating his special subject to the major theses of Marx's thought. The book will certainly have value, not only as a critical study of an important and often misinterpreted as- pect of Marx's thought, but also as an illuminating study of one phase of nineteenth-century nationalism.-JOHN D. LEWIS.</page></plain_text>
