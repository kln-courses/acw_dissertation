Jonathan Loesberg. AESTHETICISM AND DECONSTRUCTION: PATER, DERRIDA, AND DE MAN. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1991. Although we like particulars, in texts as in life, there is room to wonder why we value particularity in general. Assorted philosophic positions converge in their association between the idea and rhetoric of specificity and something like vivacity, resistance to system, or reality. Wittgenstein uses a physical metaphor of "friction" to explain how thought balances itself in language and then casts the drive to balance in the vocabulary of will ("We want to walk" [46]). The Lacanian real is that algebraic entity that will not fit into system, and although it is not material or even possible, it is figured as a "hard kernel" nonetheless, which borrows the rhetorical authority of matter [Zizek 161-64]. Baudrillard remarks with mock surprise and celebration that in Foucault's History of Sexuality Volume 1, "'power.' ... culminates, at the extreme pole, with resistances ... so small and so tenuous that, literally speaking, atoms of power and atoms of resistance merge at this microscopic level" [37]. The particular both inhabits and works against a structure, like the pearl in the oyster; this structure sometimes goes by the name of the aesthetic, since the category of the aesthetic can be seen as necessary to structure itself. In post-Kantian formulations, the aesthetic connects forms of knowledge on the basis of some universality of its own. In "The Transcendental Aesthetic" [Critique of Pure Reason 65-91], Kant explicitly separates his use of the term "aesthetic" from its use in "what others call the critique of taste" [66]. Kant's aesthetic refers, rather, to the formal organizations that make all intuitions of phenomena possible. By this logic, generality is not just a property of the aesthetic; one needs the aesthetic to produce generality. Thus Marxist theory, for example, "insofar as it continues to make claims for epistemological generality, must necessarily pass through the aesthetic at crucial moments" [Sprinker 14].1 But why does Sprinker write "must necessarily," as though the aesthetic were something dangerous that Marxist theory might not survive? He does this in part because the first sense of the aesthetic (the realm of beautiful detached objects) still colors its second sense (the realm of cognitive connection). Also behind wariness of the aesthetic, however, lies the idea that the aesthetic as generality may be opposed to human individuality as well as to mere particularity. If one associates particularity with the human, then the aesthetic looks like a necessary poison, one that connects things only by stifling what is individual in them. At the same time, things seem only to remain to be connected to the extent that they resist connection. Contemporary discussions of the aesthetic often organize the categories of particularity, generality, and resistance into a set of implicit analogies: particulars create friction within systems as matter resists form and I am grateful to EyalAmiran, Cynthia Chase, David Herman, andAdela Pinch, who made valuable suggestions about versions of this paper. 1. For similar formulations see Bennington [167] and de Man [RR 264-65]. diacritics 23.4: 42-61 42</page><page sequence="2">as individuals resist programs (this double analogy rules the formulations of much Language poetry, for instance).2 This reasoning has also blurred our understanding of deconstruction. If the aesthetic stands in academic shorthand for a transcendentalizing desire to make abstract connec- tions despite realities that stand in the way, deconstruction's interest in the aesthetic-part of its interest in all linkage and disconnection-seems to involve it, ironically, in attempts to subdue the differences that construct the philosophic boundaries it criticizes. Deconstruction's attention to differences-within, in other words, may seem to suppress rather than merely to recontextualize differences-between [see Johnson, A World of Difference 2]. Derrida's The Truth in Painting (1978; trans. 1987) responds in part to this charge; it meditates on the framing that produces the aesthetic, and also on being framed. Although there has been no shortage of Marxist and historicist thought to explain ways of seeing the aesthetic as both particular and political, our view of aesthetics continues to be distorted by its association with deconstruction and vice versa.3 My title impersonates the convention of accepting one's name from one's detractors (as Impressionism and Cubism took their names from negative reviews). I have borrowed it from Jonathan Loesberg's description of the misunderstood association between deconstruction and aesthetics (Paterian aestheticism in particular): "Disagreeing over the status of Derrida's thought, [various] critics all contend that deconstruction as literary theory amounts to a new aestheticism, a new New Criticism" [75]. In the last five or six years many responses to those contentions, agitated partly by the high stakes of the aesthetic within Paul de Man's work, have appeared on the scene, and one could call this second-generation response a new aestheticism as well. These recent aesthetic revalua- tions share the desire to reinterpret canonical aesthetic theorists and to seek anew the political implications, if any, of aesthetic particularity and generality. Frances Ferguson's Solitude and the Sublime and Jonathan Loesberg'sA estheticism andDeconstruction mark high points in this response. Both authors confront the most ubiquitous of contemporary questions, the nature of human power's foundation. Their assumption that they need to show how aesthetics faces that question is defensive but accurate. Ferguson and Loesberg feel a need to vindicate the rights of the aesthetic and of certain of its proponents (Kant and Pater) by demonstrating again how it can provide the basis for political and historical response; they claim that their conclusions bear consequences for deconstructive aesthet- ics, especially de Man's. Each author in her or his own way shakes the particularity- materiality-resistance chain. Ferguson ties human autonomy to Kant's individuation by formal unity and argues against its association with specificity as such; Loesberg locates autonomy within Pater's paradoxical notion of a particularity that contains abstraction in the form of friction. These are meticulous, imaginative, and illuminating books, Loesberg's more comprehensible and cohesive, Ferguson's more inventive, subtle, and odd. 2. Eagleton traces this compound formulation to Baumgarten and accepts it himself: "if sensation is characterized by a complex individuation which defeats the general concept, so is history itself" [16]. 3. Loesberg's detailed notes trace this opinion through works of Paul Bove, William Cain, Michael Fischer, Gerald Graff Frank Lentricchia, Daniel T. O'Hara, and others [207]. Christo- pher Norris 's The Truth about Postmodernism, most recently, "address[es] (among other things) the postmodern fashion for distorted aestheticist readings of Kant" [14]. Norris attacks all recognitions of contingency as "giddy excesses " [220] which "[leave] the road wide open to aform of thoroughgoing cognitive and ethical skepticism that would end up by blithely deconstructing the difference between 'literary' (textual) instances of undecidability and real-life issues of moral and political conscience" [241]. Norris's Kant is not "a formalist or abstract-universalist" but the inventor of "practical reason as a source of principled judgements and the primacy of open dialogical exchange as a regulative notion ... for the conduct of ethical thought" [244-45]. diacritics / winter 1993 43</page><page sequence="3">1 Ferguson's mission in Solitude and the Sublime is to rethink the supposed double edge of the aesthetic by reasserting its necessity in theories of power (the slightly less noted of its two edges) without making it sound as though its connective function wrongly subdues particularity. Ferguson's thesis is labyrinthine and oblique, and requires some exegesis. Essentially, she reformulates aesthetics by submitting that the place of material particu- larity is the wrong question, one not central to the aesthetic project after all. Ferguson first formulated the book's core position in her 1987 article "Historicism, Deconstruction, and Wordsworth,"4 now the last chapter of this book. Here, specificity appears as personhood. Ferguson suggests that Jerome McGann's desire for an awareness of the personalization of texts via production and reception shades, in his literalist's imagination, into a desire for personification in texts. Ferguson contrasts McGann's position to what she takes to be de Man's in "Excuses": that "representations essentially do not-and cannot- intersect with persons" either to highlight or to suppress them [Ferguson 147]. Her point is that de Man's antihumanist stance is no less literalist than McGann's, even though de Man discovers a materiality of the letter rather than of textual production, representation, or social function.5 Both McGann and de Man privilege particularity over generality; both assume that when instance and system collide, instance wins. As a side effect of this privilege, difference overcomes similarity. In McGann's case, difference means posi- tional variance between readers; in de Man's, it means inherent irreconcilabilities between systemic elements and finally entire systems. De Man likes to show represen- tational systems at odds (in "Excuses," referential and nonreferential interpretations of the name or sound "Marion"6) because something greater than any one system hangs in the balance: the possibility that correspondence between systems might create "a context that enables the divergent procedures of representation to converge" [Ferguson 156]. Ferguson points out that de Man's example of a heterogeneous nonsemantic, material dimension of language-the name or sound "Marion" uttered by Rousseau-differs from "a more traditional example of two diverse and even opposed names, 'morning star' and 'evening star,' applying to the same thing" [155]: while the relative stability of the referent in the "morning star "-"evening star" example creates the possibility of continually arriving at "morning star "from "evening star" by way of the referent, de Man describes a case in which the fact of competing versions of the "same thing" is seen to bracket that thing as different from the various equidistant terms that would refer to it. That is, it functions in terms of pure positionality, having counted only to bring the other terms into proximity with one another.... The apparent homology [between the two terms] .. . provides a context that enables the divergent procedures of representation to converge. It is, in other words, formal in imagining reference as a focal point for different explanatory systems. And it is precisely such a formal account of reference as a focal point that de Man is attacking. For in his account, the various ways of rendering "Marion" are put into a positional 4. Diacritics 17.4 (1987): 32-45. The issue includes Andrzej Warminski's "Response" 146- 48] and Ferguson's counter-response [49-52]. 5. Ferguson's perception of de Man's literalism owes a great deal to Rodolphe Gasche''s essay, "In-difference to Philosophy, " especially 265, 278-88. 6. See book 2 of Rousseau's Confessions [85-87] and de Man's Allegories of Reading [278- 301]. 44</page><page sequence="4">equivalence that relies upon the sense of identity but involves only the appear- ance of identity.7 [Ferguson 156] Ferguson characterizes shrewdly and accurately, here, an argument with which she disagrees, and one on which de Man's work often depends. In "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," for example, de Man aims to refute formalism by proposing that representational systems that infer the world formally become as material as the world they posit and therefore just as unknowable [Ferguson 163-64]. Ferguson follows de Man as long as "de Man's discussion ... coincides with Kant's aesthetics in imagining form as continually enabling a movement in excess of experience precisely because of its ability to proceed beyond what can be empirically perceived. Yet"-and here Ferguson marks her difference from de Man-"like Kant's account of the natural sublime, and unlike his account of the beautiful with its artificial objects, de Man's reading converts writing into a version of accident: as the formal reveals itself as material it becomes as unavailable for human purposes as nature" [154; emphasis mine]. Ferguson claims that formalism is misrepresented by materialist criticism, whether by the empiricist "materialism" of McGann or by the "formal materialism" of de Man (and of Kant as de Man understands him). Materialist readings of formalism view form as matter and so assume matter's priority over form, although this priority is presumed to be in question in the materialist-formalist debate [Ferguson 168]. Ferguson's analogy for the mind's approach to specificity is number (she supports this metaphor throughout the book by using "account" for "argument," noting what "counts as" or lies "at odds with" what, and punning on words like "singular"), and she clarifies the materialist and formalist positions by describing them as treatments of enumeration. De Man and the empiricists alike stress what there is to be counted and thereby miss the point of Kant's thought about number: that what matters-in the full sense of the word, of making things appear material-is the counting system. Kant, however, "rescues language from a fundamental empiricism, by making it clear that the relationship among the terms supplements empirical reference.... [that] the patterning of language is at least as important as its ostensible referents" [Ferguson 169], and formalism takes its meaning and authority from that Kantian insight. This counting metaphor, and most of all the number "one," links the "solitude" of Ferguson's title to her diverse subtopics: historicism's and deconstruction's apprehen- sion of the particular, Wordsworth's "We Are Seven," the personification of landscape, Malthus's and Godwin's views on population, and Adoro's neo-Burkean appropriation of the privacy of Kantian aesthetic judgment for the aesthetic whole in opposition to the individual work. Ferguson can treat these various issues by asking "how there can be one of anything" [viii] (much of Ferguson's ingenuity lies in these diverse readings, and I'm sorry to have to slight them in order to attend to a conceptual frame which is, in the book as a whole, a mere necessity). "One" is Ferguson's number because it figures not only the aesthetic "solitude" of her title but also collective oneness-the unity of a series of numbers thought of as one series, the unity Kant posits when he claims that reason wants to comprehend infinity in a single intuition [Critique ofJudgment 106-08]. In oneness, individual and collective possibility join like ends of a circle or like Godwin's image in Caleb Williams of "individuality and concert" as Siamese twins [Ferguson 99]. Most important, Ferguson's "one" challenges the association between resistance and particu- larity. Ferguson sets individual resistance against particularity to the degree that her 7. The "more traditional" discussion of "morning star" and "evening star" Ferguson has in mind here is most likely Gottlob Frege's in "On Sense and Reference" [57, 62; see also "On Concept and Object" 44]. For Frege different senses do point to a common referent, but traveling from sense to referent does not guarantee passage from sense to sense [see, for example, 58]; the referent is not imagined as a doorway between representational systems. diacritics / winter 1993 45</page><page sequence="5">4 4 q ! a -y :: :: 0 dn.? f:~ 0,] I Es : fizX 4 k t l::fCD t W!: t-m : - : ~ .</page><page sequence="6">"one" includes the oneness on the other side of multiplicity, as far east from de Man's radical materialist "one" as Japan is from Califoria. The most cohesive part of Solitude and the Sublime, its first three chapters, explores the Ur-Romantic model of individuation, Kant's response in the Third Critique to Burke's Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime andBeautiful. Burke plays de Man's unwilling precursor, for whom the representation of sensation instantaneously "desubstantializes sensation by extending it as its own self-haunting phantom" [Ferguson 59]. As de Man's textual representations of matter become matter themselves and so cannot lift themselves onto a plane of greater intelligibility, Burke's "Memories and anticipations of sensations do not so much record sensations as duplicate them" [59]. Ferguson believes that Burke's sublime, because it fails to make one of anything, "ultimately sets any individual at odds with his or her own experience" [55].8 Ferguson explicates Kant's alternative resolution in her intricate and crucial third chapter, "Burke to Kant: A Judgment outside Comparison." Kant is the hero of Ferguson's piece because she values not formalism as such but Kant's discovery of an imaginative possibility of reconciling the formal and the nonformal, or at least of a regulative will toward this reconciliation. Ferguson's originality resides in her insistence that Kant's mathematical sublime leads him toward that vision [Ferguson 24, 27]. Kant first establishes the notorious objectivity of sublime objects, which in their very nonresponsiveness-"the very lack of fit between [sublime] objects and the individuals that perceive them" [Ferguson 5]-"make the apparently objective act of cognition involve more than a mere response to objects" [Ferguson 5; Critique of Judgment 99]. Sublime objects' asymmetric, impassive relation to their perceivers resembles the psychoanalyst's controlled indifference: their neutrality makes apparent structures of mind visible. Ferguson's reading of Kant is up to this point expected. She now stresses that Kant moves from establishing the existence of mental structures to the idea that human schemata extend by pattern beyond experience [Ferguson 85; Critique of Judg- ment 110-11 ]. Kant's and Ferguson's numerical example of this capacity is the (infinite) series, the representation of the mind's comprehension of infinitude "in a numerical concept by a comprehensio logica" [Critique of Judgment 111]. The series thus brings Ferguson's concern with oneness (as individuation and as comprehension) together with her stress on formal pattern against particularity. For a series does not count particular items; it "describes the process of generating what is, by definition, unexperienced" [Ferguson 24]. While other readers of the mathematical sublime have stressed its vertiginous progression, Ferguson reminds us that it also integrates progression to a generalizing unity-and thereby, she would insist, integrates radically different represen- tational modes. Ferguson does not entirely explain how she derives her appreciation for the series from Kant, who remains dissatisfied with it. Kant implies that the series cannot adequately represent sublime infinity because it seems to succeed in representing it, whereas infinity is unrepresentable. Kant concludes that the sublime must be aesthetic because solely in "the aesthetic estimation of magnitude . . . we feel that effort, our imagination's effort to perform a comprehension that surpasses its ability to encompass" [Critique ofJudgment 112]. According to Paul Guyer, Kant specifies in an outline for the First Critique that "'allness or totality (the all) is not to be understood in a series, not to be conceived in the aggregate"' [393]. I can only guess that Ferguson perceives in Kant's description of reason's demand for "exhibition of all the members of a progressively increasing numerical series" [Critique of Judgment 111]-a demand that Kant himself rejects as a contradiction-a way of construing the series as an impossible and thereby 8. Ferguson's even and odd metaphors echo and reverse deconstructive analyses of the impossibility of the number "one" in Poe's "The Purloined Letter" and commentaries thereupon. See Johnson's The Critical Difference [117-22] and Irwin [1172-88J. diacritics / winter 1993 47</page><page sequence="7">successful representation of infinity as a sequence and an aggregate. Thus, in the series Kant "establishe[s] aesthetic representation as an impossible identity that makes the finite and the infinite impersonate one another, as the more empirical and more formal versions of each other" [Ferguson 87]. We see now that "one" holds its centrality because its paradoxical position-"not a number because not multiple, a number because homogeneous to number" [Ferguson 160]-functions in two representational systems. Ferguson implies that such a coinci- dence or intersection forms a hinge between systems which may change the way in which we look at systematicity. She proposes, for example, that Kant's shift from "red" as an example of a color in the First Critique to "green" in the Third [Critique ofJudgment 70] maintains that green implies a formal system's competence without regard for reference. Green is both a "mixed color" in painting and a "primary color" in optics; "by differing from one descriptive system to another, this self-resembling point of color becomes the means for moving between one system and another" [Ferguson 92].9 This observation is as precise and right as it is around the bend (and an example of how Ferguson as a Kant interpreter can be both traditional and eccentric: she combines Kant's own terms with a downright de Manian critical manipulation). Ferguson's praise for mutual imitation between systems modifies both "correspondence" and "coherence" accounts of systemic value by its greater accommodation of conflict [Ferguson 95]. Because the aesthetic shows how "even the formal and the empirical can ape one another... [,] the competition between production and reception localizes itself in the fleeting correspondences of antithetical coherences" [Ferguson 95; emphasis mine]. Derrida also remarks that "the nonconceptual resembles the conceptual" in the Third Critique [TP 76] and that Kant "compare[s] the comparable with the incomparable" [TP 137]. For Derrida, however, these points show that Kant's aesthetic is clandestinely analogical; for Ferguson, they show that where representational systems intersect, "the coordination of meaning counts neither as oppression nor as formal accident" [169]. Ferguson's last sentence illustrates what this might mean in social terms: in Wordsworth's "We Are Seven," the poet and little girl understand one another, although they speak empiricist and counterempiricist languages. Wordsworth's example suggests the social motivation of Ferguson's enterprise. Indeed, Ferguson asserts during her discussions of deconstruction that a skeptical- materialist account of language cannot support the possibility of a social contract [22] and that de Man's work cannot be "itself political"-although it may be about politics- "because the notion of heterogeneity has been deployed to distinguish writing-as-mark from writing-as-reference, the material from the cognitive" [14]. This last step, in which Ferguson moves toward the social potential of linguistic positions, seems more problem- atic and less closely argued than her other points. It would appear that it is because the "empirical infinite" "demonstrates the radical difference between individuals and societ- ies" [Ferguson 22] that Ferguson sets out on a Kantian quest to refute it. This thrust really belongs within and relies upon the larger ongoing debate about poststructuralist and postmodernist social potential. To humanists who assume that only belief in reference makes social intervention possible and to postmodernists who assume that it can hinder that intervention, Ferguson implicitly replies that reference doesn't matter to intervention one way or the other: nonreferential systems, rather, make the aesthetic possible, and so make possible works' social impact. Her problem with deconstructive materialism is not that it is nonreferential, but that it makes new referents out of representations. But how much of a problem is this? Granted that Burke and Adomo have continually to recreate consciousness of individuation [Ferguson 67-69]-that they cannot make their represen- tations of individuation stick-that impossibility does not automatically debilitate 9. Compare Derrida on Hegel's use of green [Glas 246]. 48</page><page sequence="8">communication. The recreation of consciousness, as we will find, can look like anything from the poverty of Hegel's mere "sense-certainty" to Stevens's pleasure of circulating. Much ink has been spent in explaining why social nihilism need not follow linguistic skepticism. Lyotard's The Postmodern Condition, with its ending call, "let us activate the differences" [82], presents one such effort; Barbara Herrstein Smith's lucid practicality in Contingencies of Value, another [see especially 150-54, 161-66, 173-84]. These arguments defend radical materialism as well as they do other forms of skepticism. Solitude and the Sublime addresses this debate as a whole, which is also to say that it never meets the debate with complete directness. Ferguson downplays ideology rhetorically by aiming her book against odd bedfellows (de Man and McGann). Still, it is surprising that she avoids direct disputation on the politics of linguistic skepticism, for although ideology is not her central concern, it supplies her work-no less than Burke's or Kant's-with its tacit significance. Solitude and the Sublime finally does most of its ideological work in an undercurrent of metaphor, despite Ferguson's own observation that metaphor too frequently controls discussions of particularity. She describes sensitively, for example, how Adorno moralizes the mind's resistance during aesthetic experience until it seems as though "distinctness from the object were itself not merely an analogy for but a version of resistance to society" [67]. Similarly, Ferguson remarks the "astonishing tendency in late twentieth-century writing to treat the relationship between individuals and the classes that they make up as equivalent to the relationship between the individual and finite, on the one hand, and the finite and the infinite, on the other" [160], yet participates in this philosophic anthropomorphism by means of analogy. Her ideological moves occur when she draws comparisons: correlations between social situations and abstract concepts allow Ferguson to shift from Kant's unified comprehension of the infinite, for example, to the internal unity of the self and to communal unity. Concrete examples can appear in Solitude and the Sublime as personifications of philosophic abstractions and abstractions as schematized versions of such examples. This allegorization is not immediately obvious because its implications run counter to the set of relationships her book emphasizes and criticizes, the associations between particularity, reality, and resistance. Ferguson's criticism of this set of associations in others obscures the fact that she uses a similarly associative set to argue the opposite position (that oneness as particularity refuses a deeper sense of oneness on the far side of multiplicity). Ferguson's allegory is no doubt partially descriptive, something she inherits from the writers she treats and reverses. It's hard, nonetheless, to dissociate Ferguson's mention from her use, since she seems to oppose the content of de Man's, McGann's, and Adorno's conclusions rather than their methods of arriving at them. A version of the naive- empirical literalization with which Ferguson charges McGann therefore returns in her reasoning. I don't mean simply to reiterate the objections of Burke and his deconstructive heirs: that the amoebalike willingness of singularities infinitely to divide sends Kant scurrying to net these perpetually dividing singularities. Ferguson acknowledges that "one" is multiple and asserts only that its multiplicity doesn't defeat its unity. The problem is not that she diminishes "one"'s multiplicity but that she herself produces multiple "ones." Although Ferguson disparages McGann's literal humanization of particularity (his wanting people to appear in Wordsworth's poems), her own book amplifies the abstraction "one" by applying its consequences to an "individual" not at all the same. It is not difference as such between "ones" that creates the problem, but rather different modes of difference. Ferguson herself emphasizes that Kant's "ones" are radically separate, in order to celebrate his ability to imagine joining them. Ferguson's "ones," however, are not Kant's. The series integrates "one" as a unit and "one" as a sequence of units; Ferguson associates with theseformal "ones" the analogic "one" of the individual mind. Personification backs up abstraction, and analogy backs up formality, diacritics / winter 1993 49</page><page sequence="9">like bodyguards following powerful figures at a discreet distance. Things are knowable to the extent they are formal, but significant in the narrative to the extent that associations humanize them. Kant's extension of pattern to unknown experiences on the model of the series has no bearing on this analogic extension (except in the negative sense that Kant uses the same figures and encounters similar problems). De Man's aesthetic, however (as I hope to show later), foresees this intervention of analogy. 2 As though to demonstrate that the particularity-materiality-resistance chain itself can function in disparate representational systems, Loesberg agrees in many ways with Ferguson's description of empiricism's problems but embraces those problems as solutions. Loesberg, too, begins with the assumption that empiricism is unstable because it cannot keep sharp the sensations upon which it relies [Loesberg 20]. Pater hopes that aesthetic experiences will have the effect of intensifying life but, like Burke, finds intensity at odds with frequency ("the death knell of uniqueness in beauty," Derrida writes [TP 93]). In Pater's words, "failure is to form habits" [Pater 189; Loesberg 19]. Pater's attachment to specificity does indeed keep him from making prescriptions. Loesberg and Pater thus accept the conventional associations of particularity to a degree that Ferguson does not: because Pater believes in "the truth of sensation, and particularly the truth of its absolute specificity, he resists any empirical movement from sensations to general laws that control or explain their significance" [Loesberg 44]. This does not mean, however, that Pater lives in a world without figure and ground, in an atomistic stream of particulars. He navigates a wholly sensational world by means of differences within sensation rather than by defining sensation against something exterior to it. In so doing, Pater anticipates deconstruction's accent upon differences-within. Pater seeks "an ideal form within sensation" from which to contemplate change without feeling annihilated by it [Loesberg 20] and finds his ideal or "essential sensation" in "self-dissolution that embodies the form of sensation as friction" [Loesberg 23]. In other words, "Pater marks the necessary and contradictory idealism within empiricism" [Loesberg 20], and by doing so diverges from "traditional" or foundational empiricism. Finally, Pater privileges art because friction- within-sensation "has its exemplary occurrence ... in the sensations that art evokes" [Loesberg 6], sensations that produce "the aesthetic perception of perception" [Loesberg 25].10 Loesberg's summary of Pater's aesthetic recalls Ferguson's rendering of Burke's similar empiricist and sensationist problems. At every turn, however, Loesberg encloses formalism within empiricism (though he does not thereby diminish formalism's neces- sity). We can see the contrast between Burke and Pater by looking at one of Ferguson's extended examples from Burke. Again, for Burke "the familiarity that causes objects once seen as sublime to come to seem merely beautiful, makes individual experience its own worst enemy.... The operation of the senses would, in the terms of the Burkean account, be self-annihilating if it operated efficiently" [Ferguson 55]. Burke's difficulty becomes especially apparent in his witticism about the audience at a tragic drama told about an execution next door: "in a moment the emptiness of the theatre would demonstrate the comparative weakness of the imitative arts, and proclaim the triumph of the real sympathy" [Burke 47; Ferguson 58-59]. Ferguson believes that Burke's execution 10. Loesberg extends the principle of exemplarity to the genre of art that Pater himself practices, historical narrative: historical narrative "reproduce[s] the constitutive conflict within sensation between the moment in which it occurred, and the abstraction of it within thought needed to give it duration" [Loesberg 1251. 50</page><page sequence="10">illustrates sublimity because it is the paradigmatic once-in-a-lifetime experience (directly for its victim, vicariously for the audience). Hence, this example "establishes sensation on the ground of a contradiction. The moment of unequivocal sensation can be imagined only as a by-product of the total loss of sensation" [Ferguson 60]. Burke's execution quickens life, in Pater's sense, by doing what Pater does not do-by placing sensation against a backdrop of nonbeing. In Pater's version of the problem, however, one anticipates not sensationlessness but a self-dissolution that is itself temporary. Thus, from a Paterian perspective, Ferguson slides unnecessarily from sensational self-dissolution- the only thing that the condemned prisoner or the audience could experience-to ideal nothingness. Self-dissolution taxes the imagination and intimates that sensation has a border, but remains itself sensational. Loesberg's explication of Pater's system of self- dissolving difference within particularity wants to provide a principle of navigation that is as reliable as a foundationalist sense of an exterior, without itself being foundationalist. Thus, if Burke's representations-or Pater's, or de Man's-become as impassive as Kant's sublime nature, then they too, like that nature, allow us to feel our resistance against them as truly ours. What we feel is the gradual distantiation of our resistance as it solidifies in turn into something to resist (cf. Ferguson's discussion of Adoro [68-69]). The inclusion of all experience within particularity-what we might call "particular- ity in general"-de-emphasizes the role that specific particularities might play in Loesberg's reasoning, but Loesberg shows that this need not depoliticize the system. This becomes explicit when Loesberg moves from Pater to Derrida and de Man and shifts his emphasis from elaboration to a discussion of consequences. Loesberg links Pater to deconstruction by holding, first, that Pater's and Derrida's enterprises are complementary and chiasmic-Pater interrogates traditional empiricism as Derrida does Continental reflection [85]-and second, that de Man extends Derrida's linguistic theory by using literary language as Pater uses art, as a model that contains the whole (throughout this discussion Loesberg maintains his parallel between Paterian aesthetics and deconstruction, so that statements apply to both). Because deconstruction posits an all-inclusive specificity, it can't display that specificity in a particular example: by its own logic, examples exceed systems. For this reason Derrida calls his own interpretation of Rousseau "exorbitant" [Of Grammatology 161]; for this reason "the example precedes" in The Truth in Painting [TP51]. It follows that, in keeping with its antifoundationalism, deconstruction cannot tell you what to do and should not: "Foundational systems do not articulate items of knowledge but only determine the preconditions of some proposition['s] being knowledge. Undermining the possibility of there being coherent foundational systems, consequently, does not undermine the truth or falsehood of some particular statement" [Loesberg 93]. Aestheticism and Deconstruction therefore does not produce examples of what critics of these movements would call political criticism, and it doesn't try to. Rather, Loesberg builds a social defense of aestheticism around the assumption that the media of sensation are likewise sensational. In a refutation of Pater's possible solipsism, Loesberg asks how the sort of self that solipsism implies could "even coexist with the deindividuating view of the self implicit in empiricism's definition of it as a bundle of sensations" [21]. Not that Pater doesn't at times insinuate a sequestered self. The opening of Pater's "Conclusion" to The Renaissance, for example ("Let us begin with that which is without-our physical life"), grates against his description of experience "ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced" [187]. But according to Loesberg, the conflict dissolves when Pater discovers that "the wall of personality has no more solidity than the sensations from which it seemingly walls us away" [Loesberg 21]; it too is made of nothing more than "impres- sions" which are themselves "in perpetual flight" [Pater 188]. This mirrors Burke's and de Man's conclusion that walls between us and experience-walls of memory and of diacritics / winter 1993 51</page><page sequence="11">language-are as solid as that from which they may wall us away. Although Pater's personality wall is insubstantial and de Man's linguistic wall is substantial, the two agree more than they disagree, since both show a self continuous with its apparent exterior. The potential social significance of Pater's point is that, "Far from being a retreat, the mind, like a sensation of the physical world, immediately becomes subject to dispersal into flux" [Loesberg 22]. To return to the metaphor of contamination at a single touch: the mind's continuity with the world-or in Ferguson's terms, formal abstraction's continuity with specificity or matter-could only cripple the mind (or formal abstraction) if matter and specificity necessarily and definitionally overpowered mind and abstraction. We have passed this place before. Ferguson also makes this point, when she claims that "de Man and [Andrzej] Warminski, in seeing materiality as necessary to language, mistakenly see materiality as exclusively constitutive of language, and make intention and systematiza- tion look like a mere imposition upon materiality" [157]. While Ferguson attributes this assumption of material priority to (for example) de Man, Loesberg attributes it only to a foundationalist reading of de Man. For belief that "an equation between language and history means reducing history to 'mere' language" [Loesberg 142] assumes that "modes of representation-art, literature, and language-must have an irreducible difference from their represented content" [Loesberg 123]. Aestheticism and deconstruction cannot possibly make this assumption, since they claim exactly the opposite, as their very critics complain. Thus, Pater, Derrida, and de Man "do not isolate the aesthetic or drain it of extra-aesthetic significance but strongly deny the existence of the category extra- aesthetic" [Loesberg 121]. Stressing that empiricism produces a continuity between mind and world, representation and experience, Loesberg highlights what others have seen as its weakness. By doing so, he can challenge the motives and effects of the insistence upon individuation, making it look like a step back instead of a step forward. Since arguments inhere in the terms in which they are cast, however, Loesberg's refusal to use opposing camps' definitions of social intervention won't likely win new hearts. Aesthetics and Deconstruction rejects most previous explanations of deconstruction's political potential. Deconstruction is not a hedonistic "exit from all ... constraints," of course [Loesberg 161]. But Loesberg asserts that it is not "a method of practical interpretation," either [165], nor a "[form] of logical disproof" [164], nor "a powerful method of exhibiting the inbuilt prejudices ... of ruling political concepts" [163]: deconstruction is a practice of self-resistance that insists that "theory cannot write off the resistance to itself as merely a matter of external politics" [Loesberg 174]. Although it therefore "cannot be used to critiquefrom the outside authoritarian concepts" [Loesberg 181; emphasis mine], this disallows critique only if critiques from within do not exist. Of course, the idea of critique from within may alter some meanings of "critique"; but that, again, is what deconstruction is about. One could argue that Ferguson misrepresents Kantian formalism and that Loesberg misrepresents Pater's skeptical empiricism, or that their renderings of particular points in Burke, de Man, McGann, and Arold reduce the complexity of the texts in question. If one accepts both Ferguson and Loesberg on their own terms, they seem to describe the same ground from opposite poles. Although Ferguson argues against empiricism and Loesberg argues for it, their descriptions of empiricism and formalism essentially agree. In addition, each critic sees her- or himself as merely asserting the equal strength and mutuality of particularity and system within aesthetics against others who lust for one term's priority. Both object to the idea that the "claim that historical understanding rests on literary structures must reduce the historical to the 'merely' literary" [Loesberg 123]. Loesberg hears conceptual foundationalists making that claim, Ferguson hears material- ists, and both hear historicists. More important, both avert, from separate directions, the idea that aesthetic connection may be essentially analogic (as Derrida and de Man appear to suggest in their discussions of Kant). Ferguson's aesthetic, being systemic, is more than 52</page><page sequence="12">analogic; Loesberg's is less than analogic, since he does not recognize the initial separation between representation and experience that analogy would require. Although Ferguson and Loesberg disagree most sharply on Paul de Man's work-a topic on which they diverge in description as well as in stance-their attitudes toward analogy differen- tiate both of their aesthetic formulations from de Man's. 3 In both Solitude and the Sublime and Aestheticism and Deconstruction, de Man emerges as the most tendentious contestant, while Derrida appears curiously above the fray. Loesberg gives sensitive and extended analyses of Derrida's quarrel with Husserl and of his position on literary language in "The Double Session" [Loesberg 101-06]. It is de Man, however, who makes Derrida's literary assumptions explicit by defining the role of the critic. Ferguson, for her part, takes The Truth in Painting as having made the strongest materialist case against Kant's Third Critique: "Derrida's version of Kant... recapitu- lates certain aspects of the social formation critique of Kant"-that is, Derrida historicizes Kant's formalism by pointing out its contingency [Ferguson 20; see TP 18-20]-but emphasizes that "it does so in the name of a desire to set aside the conceptual 'framing' that makes aesthetic pleasure look unitary and universal" [Ferguson 93]. Derrida challenges Kant in order to reinstate "the heterogeneity of aesthetic experience" [Ferguson 78], while de Man's version of this challenge seems to mean to bring language to a standstill, "as if language were so thoroughly unhomogeneous in its self-successiveness that it had to be continually restarted" [Ferguson 155; emphasis mine]. Likewise, Derrida's belief in "The irreducible excess of the syntactic over the semantic" [Dissemi- nation 221] precedes and supports de Man's idea that "language has a body of its own" [Ferguson 12]; but Derrida's excess usually implies that language "collect[s] what might appear to be new or more meanings," while "for de Man, it provides the basis for imagining a text in hyperformalist terms" [Ferguson 13]. Ferguson's de Man is not an aesthetician at all, for he writes about the aesthetic to undo it. This de Man spirits away Kant the transcendentalist and substitutes an anti-Kant who "present[s]... an extraordi- nary particularity that is so material as to be untranslatable" [Ferguson 11]. Loesberg's de Man disarticulates to rearticulate; he "uses aesthetics . . . both to embody his own binding of the philosophic with the historic and to claim an ideological significance in that binding" [Loesberg 158]. These antithetical interpretations appear clearly in relation to de Man's "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," a centerpiece of de Man's deconstructive materialism. This essay revises the aesthetic by exploring its relation to analogy and figuration. It therefore provides a way to discuss the ways in which we discuss aesthetics after de Man. De Man's essay contains four fairly distinct movements:" first, de Man asks how, given that for Kant transcendental systems determine ideology, "the substance or the structure of a transcendental discourse can [in turn] be determined" [123]. Second, de Man gives an extended close reading of the Analytic of the Sublime's failure to elaborate the links it sets out to make. Here de Man decides that Kant's reasoning"depends on a linguistic structure ... that is not itself accessible to the powers of transcendental philosophy" [132]. Third, de Man considers Kant's vision of nature in the section on the dynamical sublime as an embodiment of the failed articulation between aesthetic and rational judgment, and concludes that Kant's imagination finally "becomes adequate (angemessen) to reason on the basis of its inadequacy (Unangemessenheit) to this same reason in its relation to 1. De Man divides the essay spatially into three parts. diacritics / winter 1993 53</page><page sequence="13">nature" [140]. In a very remarkable conclusion, de Man discusses the play of letters in Kant's prose. Ferguson does not explicate de Man's Kant essay systematically, and her implicit reading of it is quite straightforward. Ferguson sees de Man as claiming that Kant makes impossible the generalizing functions of the aesthetic, which traditional Kant interpreta- tion (and Ferguson herself, for different reasons) has stressed: "All the transcendentalizing and universalizing that Kant has been seen to do, [de Man] claims, is precisely the reverse" [Ferguson 11]. Yet even though de Man's version of Kant reverses received readings, his materialism departs from that of a New Critical tradition "that suggest[s] the irreducibility of the aesthetic object" [11] only when he locates irreducibility in the letter instead of in "the unity discerned in the manifold" [Ferguson 7]. Ferguson takes the position that Loesberg refutes, then, by suggesting that de Man's emphasis on the particular disables meaning. (Ferguson differs here from the historicism that takes a similar position toward poststructuralism because she connects that historicism's own particularity to de Man's opposite sort and shows that both impair meaning by impairing the aesthetic.) Loesberg's interpretation of "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," perhaps the most intricate and ingenious part of his book, develops his thesis that de Man, like Pater, redefines aesthetics as "eccentric centrality" [Loesberg 145]. Loesberg focuses on de Man's assertion that Kant uses an untranslatable "linguistic principle" to ground the sublime [Loesberg 146-47; de Man 130]. Loesberg notes that this idea seems weak, based as it is on a mere analogy between the structures of the sublime and of grammar, and that de Man does, for the moment, "assert a reduction to language rather than an equivalence between linguistic and philosophic structures" [Loesberg 147]. Loesberg goes on, however, to demonstrate in his own de Manian turn that "the form of de Man's argument realigns its conclusions" [149]. The third movement of de Man's essay, which seeks to embody Kant's failed articulation textually, itself presents a disarticulation. De Man's third movement concretely illustrates Kant's dependence on untranslatable linguistic elements "by using a literary critical gesture, delineating a text's formal embodiment of an argumentative structure, to rearticulate de Man's logic.... Thus if de Man's analysis deconstructs ... Kant's aesthetics to show its reduction to language, the mode of his analysis enacts the central moment in that aesthetics" [148]. De Man's text suggests that the aesthetic requires perpetual reconstruction; his "ambiguously structured articulations" imply that the "letter" upon which he ends does not impede aesthetic connection but "labels an alternative aesthetic, de Man's own" [149--50]. Loesberg's argument is suggestive, and I would like to explore its possibilities further by showing a different route to its conclusions. The best way to do this is to trace the role of analogy in de Man's text. Loesberg remarks that de Man reconstitutes the aesthetic moment through "formal embodiment"; I would point out that de Man does this by means of what he calls "the homology between concept and figure." With this homology in mind de Man can write of Nietzsche's "On Truth and Lie" that it is "like the Third Critique" ["Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," RR 239]. De Man's attitude toward concept and figure is important because it shows that in accusing Kant of constructing the aesthetic analogically, de Man chooses an accusation maximally applicable to himself. As Gasche observes, de Man's "'method' is based on positive analogy" [272]. Thus, de Man's analysis of Kant's analogically constructed aesthetic sets himself up as Kant's double. De Man's revision of Kant begins in earnest when he describes Kant's sublime as a "system of substitution" on the "model of discourse as a tropological system" [130]: Comprehension . . . grows increasingly difficult as the space covered by apprehension grows larger. The model reminds one of a simple phenomenology of reading, in which one has to make constant syntheses to comprehend the 54</page><page sequence="14">successive unfolding of the text.... [T]he model that is being suggested is no longer, properly speaking, philosophical, but linguistic. It describes, not a faculty of the mind, be it as consciousness or as cognition, but a potentiality inherent in language.... The desired articulation of the sublime takes place ... within such a purelyformal system. Itfollows, however, that it is conceivable only within the limits of such a system.... When the sublime is translated back, so to speak, from language into cognition... it loses all inherent coherence and dissolves in the aporias of intellectual and sensory appearance. [129-30] Because it hinges on an analogy, this moment gives Loesberg the most pause: The ascription to the linguistic depends on an analogy between the workings of apprehension and comprehension and certain grammatic and reading struc- tures, and analogy hardly proves identity. This flaw seems particularly problematic in the light of [de Man's] insistence that the linguistic cannot be translated back to the cognitive: if the translation from the cognitive to the linguistic occurs by way of analogy, why will not the same analogy get us back? Moreover, the refusal to allow a translation back, at this point, does assert a reduction to language rather than an equivalence between linguistic and philosophic structures. [147] De Man's claim troubles Loesberg both because it is analogic (it compares apprehension to reading, the philosophic to the linguistic) and because it is not really analogic (the comparison is unidirectional and does not work). Loesberg reassimilates this passage by examining de Man's rhetorical structure. One can explain it without taking that detour, however, if one sees it as descriptive rather than argumentative (the false analogy is Kant's idea, and it disturbs de Man). De Man is asserting not that there is no bridge between language and cognition but that there is no prelinguistic cognition. He cannot translate the linguistic sublime "back" into cognition because it was never cognitive in the first place. That's why he writes that the sublime "is translated back, so to speak": such a translation can occur only as a figure of speech, and the sublime never was anything "but a potentiality inherent in language" [130]. Moreover, the specific analogy between the processes of substitution in Kant's sublime and in "tropological discourse"-between cognition and language as systems-is not as important as de Man's introduction of analogy itself as a theme. It is as though perceiving this one (false) analogy allows de Man to recognize the more deeply figurative character of the Critique ofJudgment as a whole. Having worked through Kant's notion of the mediating imagination, which finally joins reason and practical judgment, albeit negatively and paradoxically, de Man looks back at Kant's text and realizes that it is all "a story, a dramatized scene of the mind in action": The faculties of reason and of imagination are personified, or anthropomor- phized, like the five squabbling faculties hilariously staged by Diderot in the Lettre sur les sourds et les muets, and the relationship between them is stated in delusively interpersonal terms. What could it possibly mean, in analytical terms, that the imagination sacrifices itself, like Antigone or Iphigenia.... How can faculties, themselves a heuristic hypothesis devoid of any reality-for only people who have read too much eighteenth-century psychology and philosophy might end up believing that they have an imagination or a reason, the same way they have blue eyes or a big nose-how can faculties be said to act, or even to act freely, as if they were conscious and complete human beings? [141] diacritics / winter 1993 55</page><page sequence="15">We should recall Ferguson's paraphrase of de Man's point in "Excuses": "represen- tations essentially do not-and cannot-intersect with persons" [Ferguson 147]. What de Man says here, however, is not that representations don't intersect with persons but that they are made to stand in for persons, with which they are obviously not identical. It is at this point, just as de Man has revealed the allegoric quality of the Third Critique, that a battle ensues, both in Kant's text and in de Man's, between figuration (allied with personification and therefore with human unity) and the materiality of the letter. If the structures that lend meaning to experience are not mental forms like space and time but linguistic figures, experience that is not yet meaningful is like language as sheer matter, and the capacity to impose meaning on that experience is like the power to make language figurative or to see a human face in nonhuman letters. Kant's prime example of a meaningful figure, according to de Man, is the human body. De Man therefore follows the Critique of Judgment by paying attention to Kant's use of figures, especially that of the human body as a metaphor for unity. De Man makes the case that Kant's vision of nature as a unity free from anthropo- morphism is purely optical and therefore "entirely material, emphatically not tropological" [141]. But he then observes that Kant's allegory of imagination, which follows Kant's discussion of purely optical perceptive unity, contradicts that unity's values: Kant dehumanizes nature only to personify abstract faculties. De Man finds the same vacillation between humanizing allegory and sheer materiality elsewhere in Kant's work. In the Critique of Pure Reason, for example, Kant could define unity in a manner "much closer to the allegory of the faculties" [de Man 141]: "this unity is conceived in organic terms... apparent from the recurring metaphor of the body, as a totality of various limbs and parts" [de Man 142]. De Man finally resolves what he sees as Kant's ambivalence by suggesting that in the Third Critique, Kant returns to the image of the human body only to show that it is no longer a totality. Kant claims in the Third Critique that in order to consider the human body beautiful, we must think of it "entirely severed from any purpose or use" [de Man 142-43; Critique of Judgment 81], and de Man equates this severance with conceptual disarticulation. When de Man considers how far Kant has moved from the First Critique's organic unity, he decides that the Third Critique renounces aesthetic connection and that Kant's text actualizes this renunciation linguistically in its material play of letters. De Man's narrative of Kant's development seems implausible, because de Man gives such a vivid sense of Kant's vacillation between tropological unity and antiaesthetic materiality that his closing stress on the latter does not suffice to steady it. De Man himself (in "The Rhetoric of Temporality" and "Aesthetic Formalization in Kleist," for example) distrusts the authority of endings; the reader can expect some reassertion of figure. It occurs, in that figuration completely pervades de Man's own text-most of all in the very notion of the letter, which de Man has made to stand for the lack of figuration: "What, finally, will be the equivalence of this moment in the order of language? . . . To the dismemberment of the body corresponds a dismemberment of language, as meaning- producing tropes are replaced by the fragmentation of sentences and propositions into discrete words, or the fragmentation of words into syllables or finally letters" [143-44; emphasis mine]. Equivalence, correspondence: having shown that Kant's text renounces figuration, that it moves from an anthropomorphized and figured unity to "material disarticulation," de Man associates that renunciation with "the letter" by way of a figurative equivalence. De Man himself consistently perceives abstractions as human- ized allegories, as when he asserts that "In Lukacs's story [Essay on the Novel], the villain-time-appears as the hero, when he is in fact murdering the heroine-the novel-he is supposed to rescue" ["The Rhetoric of Blindness," BI 104]. Neil Hertz has shown that such figuration characterizes de Man's enterprise, which is full of vividly anthropomorphized formal arguments against anthropomorphism [see "Lurid Figures"]. 56</page><page sequence="16">4i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i ,. :7u l r~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ..... II~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ R</page><page sequence="17">Thus, if "the question arises whether... particularly meaningful movements or events are not being generated by random and superficial qualities of the signifier," as de Man writes in "Shelley Disfigured" [RR 114], the question must also arise whether apparently random and superficial qualities of the signifier may be particularly meaningful events. Indeed, de Man's concrete demonstration of letters' obstruction of the unity of Kant's argument enacts both the possible intentionality and the possible randomness of the letter. Ferguson paraphrases de Man's conclusion as follows: "de Man's notion of untranslatability suggests that in Kant, 'this most inconspicuous of stylists,' one cannot change a letter without losing a sense of 'how decisively determining [is] the play of the letter and of the syllable, the way of saying (Art des Sagens) as opposed to what is being said (das Gesagte)"' [13]. But this is what de Man actually writes: In Kleist's text [Uber das Marionettentheater], one would isolate the dissemina- tion of the word' Fall' and its compounds... as by the addition of one single mute letter which makes 'Fall' (fall) into 'Falle' (trap). No such artful moments seem to occur, at first sight, in Kant. But just try to translate one single somewhat complex sentence ofKant, or just consider what the efforts of entirely competent translators haveproduced, and you will soon notice how decisively determining the play of the letter and of the syllable, the way of saying (Art des Sagens) as opposed to what is being said (das Gesagte)-to quote Walter Benjamin-is in this most unconspicuous of stylists. [144] It is possible that de Man has changed a letter in the word "inconspicuous," as though to literalize Poe's letter's hiding in plain sight. This switch of letters could be a lexical or typographical error, of course. If not, however, Ferguson's correction falls into de Man's trap and, like mistranslation, does illuminate the passage's determination. An intentional reading could draw the following conclusions: (1) De Man's switch of letters puts himself in Kant's place as the stylist of the piece; it signifies a change of person, as would a shift from "I" to "you." (2) Further, the change from in- to un- represents a move from human figure to nonhuman materiality. "Inconspicuous" is a word, while "unconspicuous" is not; it is a comprehensible neologism that may be mistaken for a word, but it isn't a word in that it has not been socialized, accepted, exchanged, and to that extent humanized. The connotations of in- and un- support this distinction. In- suggests intention and a strongly negative version of what it prefaces, whereas "un- is frequently confined to stressing mere lack and is consequently rather neutral and literal .... Thus unhuman and unartistic primarily apply to what is outside the realm of the human and artistic. Inhuman and inartistic imply the contrary of what is human and artistic, such as cruelty and lack of taste or talent" [American Heritage Dictionary]. (3) By this same logic of intentionality, the letter cannot work to demonstrate the sort of materiality to which de Man calls attention. While de Man states that the letter is unhumanly material, the status of the letter in this passage is anything but purely "neutral and literal"; it may be wholly intentional and representational. We could say, similarly, that Kant's movement from one image of a body to another cannot show dehumanization, because the figure of a dismembered body is still an anthropomorphized figure. De Man's switch of letters might be inhuman, but since it may be intentional it cannot be completely unhuman, and it therefore grates against the unhumanity that de Man describes in the moment that the letter occurs. Thus, as the play of Kant's letters enables de Man to find Kant forsaking aesthetic connection, the play of de Man's letter opens up the possibility that "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," the supposed cornerstone of de Man's radical materialism, expresses the persistence of human intention, manifest in figuration. Such are the consequences of the possible meaningfulness of the apparently random implied by the possible randomness of the apparently meaningful. 58</page><page sequence="18">But of what, for de Man, is possible meaningfulness in turn composed? In "Shelley Disfigured," de Man concludes that language becomes meaningfully tropic "only ... because we impose, in our turn, on the senseless power of positional language the authority of sense and of meaning.... [L]anguage posits and language means (since it articulates) but language cannot posit meaning" [RR 117]. The intention that I see returning in "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant" when I call de Man's play of letters willful is my intention, my coercion of de Man's text. In de Man's terms this meaning- fulness, too, is rendered not "my own" by its very force. Although de Man might concur, then, with Derrida's contention that "the principle of analogy is here [in the Third Critique] indeed inseparable from an anthropomorphic principle" [TP 117], de Man's anthropomorphic figuration is in its own way opaque. On the other hand, "perception of the opaque" is something of a contradiction in terms. This chain of assertions, each of which "forgets the knowledge achieved by the forgetting that precedes it" [RR 119], makes it necessary, as Loesberg concludes, to weave and reweave the aesthetic. While de Man's notion of figurative force renders the aesthetic manufactured, temporary, and fictive, his self-enclosure within its logic makes it difficult to say that it is finally antiaesthetic. De Man and Derrida make of the aesthetic a fictive bridge-in a pejorative as well as merely "necessary" sense-upon which they nevertheless stand (and fall). It therefore seems incomplete to conclude, with Ferguson, that "modern criticism" (of which she makes de Man an example) "sees a gap" where "Kant sees an interval" [Ferguson 169]. Loesberg's reading of deconstructive aesthetics often sees neither a gap nor an interval, nor any seam whatsoever between representations and anything external to them. In this case, there is never any more or less than one of anything (at least not for long). Alternatively, Loesberg shows that what seem to be gaps in de Man can be seen as constructive intervals, with the proviso that they be seen as self-deconstructive as well: de Man's aesthetic "determin[es] that connection [between philosophy and ideology] in terms of the lack of connection that any reflection of articulation upon itself reveals" [Loesberg 150]. Finally, de Man himself suggests that the problems of an analogic and figurative aesthetic cannot be avoided. In his essay on Kleist, de Man declares that the Falle or trap "is the ultimate textual model of this and of all texts, the trap of an aesthetic education which inevitably confuses dismemberment of language by the power of the letter with the gracefulness of a dance" [RR 290]. De Man's "this" refers to Kleist's essay, but also, of course, to his essay on Kleist-"this" text that we are reading. In "Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant," too, de Man builds the aesthetic trap and then leaps into it. This willing self-implication marks Derrida's aesthetic as well (though more subtly), as the structure of The Truth in Painting indicates. After Derrida shows in "Parergon" how Kant frames the aesthetic, he encloses in the middle of the book the two art-critical apprecia- tions "+R (Into the Bargain)" and "Cartouches," with an open invitation to read them as Derrida has read Kant: "I would let myself be framed" [TP 151]. What Derrida writes of Benjamin is true of himself: "On the one hand the theorist of the political stakes of the market... wary and demystifying with respect to reactionary ideologies and the fetishist ritual, Benjamin also appeared as a great aesthete.... Painful irony of a self-portrait" [TP 177]. De Man's and Derrida's displaced self-portraits characterize their aesthetics' elegiac fall and Falle. As ever, deconstruction begins at home. It is difficult to paraphrase de Man without inadvertently understating his positions. It is hard even to convey the dramatic difference between his ordinary-looking, extraor- dinarily imaginative trompe-l'oeil essays and the critical contexts to which they belong- like the difference between a Borges story and an encyclopedia article. We would like contemporary aesthetics to have developed perspectives that out-invent its sources, but under the circumstances, this is a tall order. These books reach for that perspective in an established way, by playing grandfathers against fathers. The new new aestheticism (defenses of and commentaries upon deconstructive aesthetics) winds up looking a lot diacritics / winter 1993 59</page><page sequence="19">older than the new aestheticism of first-generation deconstruction. Like other aspects of contemporary criticism (such as the movement in cultural studies) and perhaps in response to them, it folds back from the aspirations of aesthetic innovators like de Man, Derrida, Lacoue-Labarthe, and Lyotard. This is less than ideal, since part of aesthetics' appeal lies in its power to provide the sense of an approaching limit. Aesthetics can seem ordinary in the context of Continental philosophy, in which extremes are norms, but in literary criticism, aesthetics is a perpetual avant-garde. De Man's and Derrida's work in aesthetics continues to look new because it struggles to keep figuration, especially its own, within the circle of its considerations. This concentration upon figuration can dramatically change our ideas without telling us what to change them to. Here it shows that the competing sets specificity-materiality-resistance and system-abstraction-restraint are readily transformable. Each element can carry different metaphoric freight, and the cars change places to form new trains of thought. One can demonstrate the transformability of the sets as such by following contingent shifts in the figurative value of each element. Deconstruction does not end with attention to figure, but it does often begin there. The theories of human power that many now seek could likewise test themselves against the biases of curious figures: could they accom- modate the notion of person, for example, in Mandelstam's lines, "It's not I, it's not you- it's they.... / They have no names. He who enters their cartilage / falls heir to their domains" [83]? Could current assumptions about particularity and materiality cope with Celan's Last Poems, with its wish or command "TO SPEAK WITHblind alleys / about the face-to-face . . . / to chew / this bread, with / writing teeth [MIT DEN SACKGASSEN sprechen / vom Gegeniiber... / dieses / Brot kauen, mit / Schreibzahnen]" [119, 118]? Without the capacity to adapt theory to a continually expanding range of metaphor, we are capable of thinking that truth is like a naked female figure and other such ideas. Wittgenstein appreciated Freud for his ability to liberate thought by discovering figures in language as a scholar discovers a "lost" manuscript in the Bodleian library: "'It's all excellent similes,' he said in a lecture on Freud's work; and of his own contribution to philosophy: 'What I invent are new similes"' [Monk 357]. Notice that Wittgenstein too not only perceives figuration but understands it by participating in it. Both Solitude and the Sublime and Aestheticism and Deconstruction dramatize the continuing centrality of the aesthetic in thought about individuation and power. While Loesberg's effort is more consistent, Ferguson's elaborate parallels between subjects unlike ultimately illuminate the field a little more. Nothing else is as likely to keep new aestheticisms new. WORKS CITED Baudrillard, Jean. Forget Foucault. New York: Semiotext(e), 1987. Bennington, Geoffrey. Lyotard. Writing the Event.
