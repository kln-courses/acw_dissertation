<plain_text><page sequence="1">EICHENDORFF'S SYMBOLIC LANDSCAPE* By Oskar Seidlin IT SEEMS TO ME one of the most exciting and baffling characteristics of Eichendorff's art that, if I may use this paradox, his most profound insights are hidden on the surface. They travel, a strangely elusive con- traband, in the full light of day, so that the last truths of his poetic vi? sion, the whole web of his religious beliefs, his intellectual conceptions, his socio-ethical postulates transform themselves into the most decep- tively simple folk tunes, sung by his people with an ease and unconcern usually assigned in the secular psalter of a nation to that section which is headed "folk song, author unknown." Goethe's solemn warning with regard to the ultimate secret and mystery of life, his injunction "Teil it no one but the sages," was utterly lost on Eichendorff. He told it to every listening ear; and so it could happen that what in reality was an explora- tion and manifestation of truth, the poetic transmission of knowledge, was taken?or mistaken?as a bewitching play of lyrical mood and atmosphere.1 A comprehensive and integrated view of life thus turned in the public's hand into a picture book, lovely and self-contained, easy to peruse; and for the reader it was easy to absorb its sensuous refulgence without comprehending the meaning of design, color, and composition. Since this is the situation, it may not be amiss to focus, when searching for some of the hidden secrets of Eichendorff's art, on the smooth surface, to start with one of his most popular songs, a favorite with every young- ster?and every Mannerchor. Here is its third stanza: Da steht im Wald geschrieben, Ein stilles, ernstes Wort Vom rechten Tun und Lieben, Und was des Menschen Hort. Ich habe treu gelesen Die Worte schlicht und wahr, Und durch mein ganzes Wesen Ward's unaussprechlich klar.2 * Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the poet's death (26 Nov. 1957). 1 Even so discerning and recent a critic as Otto F. Bollnow, Unruhe und Geborgenheit (Stuttgart, 1953), p. 146, labels EichendorfFs poetry as "im ausgepragtesten Sinne Stim- mungsdichtung." In his chapter on Eichendorff in Geist der Goetheseit, iv (Leipzig, 1953), 232-246, Hermann A.KorfT shows a curious indecision whether to see in Eichendorff a cre? ator of symbols or a weaver of bewitching moods. After some interesting initial attempts at interpretation, Korff loses himself in the shopworn generalities about music, spell, mood pictures. 2 Eichendorffs Werke, (Stuttgart: Cotta, 1953), i, 36. Throughout this article I refer to this edition. 645</page><page sequence="2">646 Eichendorff s Symbolic Landscape Here, as in a nutshell, we can grasp Eichendorff's conception of nature. It is for him the spatial medium upon which the word, the logos, is pro- jected; not, to stress that right at the beginning, a second revelation by which the spirit manifests itself directly; not Scripture with a capital S, but the tablet on which the inscription appears; not the meaning but the hull in whose shape man's love and doing, his treasures and resort become visible; not the voice itself but the lips which actualize the speech. If we take Eichendorff's metaphor seriously, the word of which he speaks does not transmit itself spontaneously, is not absorbed by feeling, not un- locked by intuition or immersion, but it has to be read faithfully in order to yield its light inexpressible. All this is but another way of saying that for Eichendorff and in Eichendorff's work nature and landscape are a system of symbols; not, as has been so readily and generally assumed, an evocation of moods, a hypnotic stimulant of feeling, but a cryptogram which has to be deciphered, a pictorial sign language which (and this cannot surprise us now) is often referred to as a mass of hieroglyphs.8 In his first greatwork,in^l/wwttg und Gegenwart,we read:"How true it is that each landscape has by nature an idea of its own which tries to become articulate, as if by stammering words, in its brooks, trees and mountains" (n, 96). And in his late short novel, Eine Meerfahrt} the hieroglyph is no longer used simply as a simile for nature, but actually becomes one and the same with her: "All around them the rising morning gilded over the initials of a wondrous, unknown writing" (n, 765). Thus forewarned we ought not to yield unquestioningly to the sensuous magic of Eichendorff's landscapes, to the lure of their atmospheric spell; we shall have to "read" them faithfully, all the more faithfully the more plainly and truly they seem to speak. So it may be appropriate to begin with the plainest and truest of Eichendorff's works, with Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts, and further with the plainest and truest scene of the whole book. By "plain and true" I mean that here for the first and only time in the little story a locality is clearly identified and geographically fixed: the immediate surroundings of Rome, and finally the city itself.4 Yet what does our little hero see when he approaches the goal of his long and circuitous roamings? Still quite some distance away, at the mere mention of the name, there rises from his memory a fantastic landscape. As a boy, still in his childhood home, he saw mirrored on the sky among * See Liselotte Dieckmann's penetrating article "The Metaphor of Hieroglyphics in German Romanticism," CL, vn (Fall 1955), 306-312. Alice Hirschfeld's dissertation, Die Natur als Hieroglyphe (Breslau, 1936), deals only, and quite unimaginatively at that, with Hamann, Herder, Lenz, and Novalis. 4 I have given a close reading of this passage in my article "Der Taugenichts ante portas," JEGP, lii (Oct. 1953), 509-524; now also reprinted in Aurora, 1956 [Eichendorff Alma- nach] (Kulturwerk Schlesien, Neumarkt), pp. 70-81.</page><page sequence="3">Oskar Seidlin 647 the moving clouds a city with strange mountains and precipices on the blue sea, with golden gates and shimmering towers upon which angels are singing in golden gowns?a fairy tale dream, we must say, hardly a description of the city of Rome. But then, after all, he is still some distance away, just imagining things in anticipation. Yet now he comes closer; the city, so he tells us, is actually spreading underneath his feet. But what does he see now? A long wisp of fog hovering above a sleeping lion, over whom mountains stand guard like dark giants. At that point we are thoroughly in doubt whether the landscape which Eichendorff conjures up before us has anything to do with Rome and its environs. Our doubts become certainty when, reading on, we hear that before finally reaching the city gates the little Good-for-nothing has to cross a big lonely heath, bleak and still as the grave, covered with ruins and withered, twisted shrubbery. But that isn't enough. Suddenly the under- world opens up before us: there buried below the gloomy heath is an old city from which the heathens often rise to the surface to lead the lonely wanderers astray. No less than three times does the word "grave" ap? pear in this short description of the bleak plain, and three times as well, the word "heath" plus its derivation "heathen"?a derivation which, we are convinced now, we must not take as an etymological pun, but as a metaphysical signpost. Those ghosts from the underworld have no power over our little hero; he strides on without looking to right or left. For now the city rises before him, and lo and behold! it is the city he had seen in his childhood dreams, with gates and towers shimmering in golden light as if angels were standing on every pinnacle. Do we still have to ask what this Roman landscape means? Is it not clear that we are treated here not to a scenic description but to a theological vision: the celestial city, beginning and end of man's roaming, primordial image and distant lure of salvation, reachable only by crossing, undaunted, the heathenish heath, dry, lightless, and full of subterranean temptations? Only if we faithfully read the "word" which transmits the hope for redemption and terror of damnation as it is inscribed in this Roman landscape, only then shall we discover the little Good-for-nothing in his full stature. He is the brave Christian knight on the road: his childish naivete is the seal of innocence, his stubborn love for the lady fair is the shield and weapon of faith, his wanderlust is the quest for man's true homestead, his moments of dejection are the fear and trembling which seize us at the realization that we do not belong, do not rest secure in God's hand, his merry sing? ing and fiddling are a grateful paean in praise of the Creator. Landscape as visible theology, serving as the key with which deeper perspectives of the unfolding story are opened up?this is a feature occurring again and again in Eichendorff's writings. Sometimes the scenic picture carries within itself its own commentary, or at least a clue</page><page sequence="4">648 Eichendorff's Symbolic Landscape to its meaning. In Ahnung und Gegenwart Friedrich, the protagonist, has a dream in which he saw an unlimited horizon, sea, rivers and countries, immense wrecked cities with broken gigantic columns, the old manor house of his childhood strangely in ruins. Some ships floated in the background toward the sea; upon one of them stood his deceased father as he had often seen him in portraits, looking unusually serious. Yet everything was as if wrested from the twilight, vague and unrecog- nizable as a huge blurred picture; for a dark storm swept over the whole view, as if the world were burnt, and the immense smoke settling down over the devas- tation. (ii, 165 f.) Here there is no doubt for a moment that we are observing the eschato- logical vision of the apocalypse and not simply an uncanny Romantic landscape. In the foreground of the picture is a child of "wonderful dignity and beauty" who points with a rosy finger at the wild scenery and, at the end of the description, emerges again, this time leaning against a huge cross, and talking to the sleeper: "If you love me truly, go down with me; as a sun you will rise again, and the world will be free." The whole Christian doctrine of salvation, including the passion, the day of judgment, and the resurrection has here become tangible in a land- and seascape. It will not do to dismiss the almost allegorical character of this scene and scenery by pointing out that we are, after all, dealing with a dream vision. The very greatness of Eichendorff's work and world consists just in the fact that vision and description of so-called reality are inseparable, that for him vision is really that which can be seen. It can almost be stated as a rule that the more clearly a description is related to a specific locality, the more visionary it turns out to be. We noticed it in the Rome episode of Aits dem Leben eines Taugenichts; we find it anew in the opening scene of Ahnung und Gegenwart. Again, it is the only instance in the whole voluminous novel where a concrete locality is pictured. Whoever has traveled up river on the Danube from Regensburg knows the magnificent spot which is called "the whirl." Steep mountain gorges surround the strange place. In the middle of the stream rises a curiously shaped rock, from which a tail cross looks down, consoling and peaceable, into the chute and collision of the raging waves. No human being is to be seen here, no bird sings; there is only the continuous, century-old roaring of the woods on the slopes, and of the terrible vortex which draws all life into its unfathomable abyss. The mouth of the vortex opens from time to time, with a glimmer dark as the eye of death. (n, 9 f.) For all we know that may be the description of a specific scene near Regensburg, but undeniably it is the vision of life's stream, rushing madly and in circular motion into the dark mouth of death but for the</page><page sequence="5">Oskar Seidlin 649 unshakable rock upon which the sign and voucher of salvation was erected. Clearly, then, Eichendorff's landscapes are not self-contained pictures, vehicles for the transmission of subjective emotions, but they express the ontology of man's fate and existence. Hc certainly meant it seriously, and not merely as a noncommital out- burst of lyric enthusiasm when, in Ahnung und Gegenwart, he had Leontin exclaim: "How earnestly and mirthfully life, boundless and still un? known, looks at us out of woods and mountains, out of young girls' faces beckoning from bright castles, out of streams and old fortresses!" (ii, 40). Indeed, woods and mountains, streams and fortresses serve again and again as a prefiguration of life still unknown; they are not picturesque surroundings, but the pictorial interior of action, situation, and character. The empty highways which the Good-for-nothing sees from the treetop, extending in the early morning light like bridges far over the mountains and valleys, are not simply a panorama, but the very reminder to go on with his quest; and the Danube is not just a river, but the promise and, finally, the actuality of finding one's way home. For this reason, in our story it can flowT through a geographical location we know to be incorrect: very close to the Italian frontier, so close that the Good-for-nothing can see it as a shimmering ribbon from the mountain ridge that separates Italy and Austria. Should we call to Eichendorff's attention that there is actually a distance of a good three hundred kilo- meters between the northernmost point of Italy and the Danube? And what if he wanted to call to our attention that the Good-for-nothing is coming home, sailing into port, and that for this occasion the Danube must be on hand? Landscape, thus presented, is not ornamental but emblematic; its iconography will again and again reveal the existential condition of man, or at least the existential condition of the particular character who moves in this scenery. Indeed, it should be possible to read the whole action of the short story Das Marmorbild?search and temptation and final redemption of its hero, Florio?by just looking at the scenery through which he passes: initiation into life and into the community of the living?a lovely green meadow strewn with flowers, dotted with friendly tents in whose shadows a gay crowTd is strolling; the threat of seduction and sin?a mysterious garden, full of exotic, bumingly bright flowers; the breaking of the deadly languid spell of the enchantress ?a bright peacef ul plein-air scene with a sturdy gardener who, shovel over his shoulder, starts his day's work on his little plot of land; the final shaking off of the evil bewitchment and the opening up of the new good life?a horseback journey into the blossoming, fertile spring country, bathed in the light of the morning sun, in the company of the true friend, the true beloved and her father. To realize the degree of complexity and completeness with which the</page><page sequence="6">650 Eichendorff s Symbolic Landscape emblematic landscape foreshadows the existential condition, it may be worth looking more closely at one of the scenic designs within the se? quence just mentioned. When Florio for the first time strays into the orbit of the dangerous enchantress, her garden is described as follows: High galleries formed by arched beech trees received him there with their solemn shadows, among which golden birds fluttered like blown-off blossoms while tail, strange flowers, the like of which Florio had never seen, dreamily moved to and fro in the soft wind with their yellow and red chalices. In the great loneliness there splashed monotonously innumerable fountains, playing with gilded spheres .... Florio looked in surprise at the trees, fountains, and flowers, for it seemed to him as if all this had become submerged long ago, as if the stream of days were flowing above him with light, bright ripples, and the garden were lying down there enchanted and in bondage, dreaming of life gone by. (n, 321) No doubt the park itself lives under a spell, but beyond that the things in the garden reveal the very nature of the spell which, soon enough, will envelop Florio himself. Let us try to decipher the hieroglyph which this strange garden represents.6 It is a space sealed off by the vaulted tree branches against the sky, the heavenly light, filled with shadows, un- canny shadows indeed. For if, as we are told, the birds are fluttering among them, we cannot conceive of them as simply shadows on the ground thrown by the beech trees, but willy-nilly they assume a third dimension, and with that the lightless, shadowy world of the tree gallery changes imperceptibly into the ominous world of shadows. The birds which populate this world move like blown-off blossoms, not propelled by their own will, but drifting passively, helplessly gliding downwards, animals without anima. In this world vegetative life, telluric life, the flowers, grow tail, they are bound to the earth, caught within themselves ?dreaming?glowing proudly in their fiery colors?red and yellow? burning with their own light since we know that the light from above, from the genuine source of all light, cannot filter through to them. And the fountains complete the picture of vacuity and futility: a monotonous perpetuum mobile, a motion continuously sinking back into itself, a sense- less playing with shimmering toys, up and down, rising and falling, in- cessantly. Do we still need Florio's observation that this garden is sub? merged, cut off from the stream of days which, in bright ripples, passes over it? The shadowiness which the day cannot penetrate, the emas- culated will, the captivity in one's own self, the burning color which needs no outside source of light, the automatic motion spending and replenish- ing itself by inane circling?this is the garden of sin, sin as a garden; and if wre were called upon to give it a name, sloth, the deadliest of the 6 A short allusion to the "meaning" of this garden is found in Josef K\mz,Eichendarjff: Hohepunkt und Krise der Spdtromantik (Oberursel, 1951), pp. 171 f.</page><page sequence="7">Oskar Seidlin 651 seven deadly sins, might do better than any other. This garden, as scenery, evokes precisely the horror which a little later, when Florio enters the castle of the enchantress, will be produced in a scene. The spell which the garden prefigured will then become actuality, with all the familiar elements present: the shadows, the paralysis of the will, the deadly introversion and repetition, magnificently expressed by the fact that in all the female pictures on the tapestries Florio seems to recognize the sorceress' countenance, in all the male likenesses his own features. Yet Florio will be saved. While the temptation is closing in on him, he hears from the outside an old pious song, and at the moment of highest danger he prays "from the deepest depth of his soul: God, my Lord, do not let me get lost in the world!" (n, 338). The break-through has come: grace, waiting and offered, has been accepted by man's prayer; sloth has been vanquished. The spell is broken. When Florio emerges, he finds another garden, tiny and modest, shimmering in the bright light of morning, with vines growing sturdily around a little farmhouse on whose roof there strut, merrily cooing, the turtle-doves, the birds of sweet and faithful love. Since Eichendorff's landscape is not meant to be taken as rich and diversified ornament, nor as the expression of psychological moods with their innumerable possibilities of nuance, it becomes understandable that he can, yes, that he must, limit himself to a bare minimum of scenic features.6 He has often been blamed for his narrow range, his almost monomaniac fixation on the same basic settings?garden, forest, meadow, river, mountain gorges, heath?and for the primitive simplicity of the colors which he has on his palette, and which are lacking in variety, shades, and transitions.7 Yet if we realize that his landscapes actually enact the basic situations of religious existence, quest and home-coming, threat of temptation and hope for salvation, nearness to and distance from God, then it will not surprise us to see the same panorama over and over again. What mattered to him was to bring into sharp focus, through the hieroglyph of the landscape, the essential truth he had to convey, and for this reason the scenic view had to be revelatory, but not richly impressionistic or realistically individualized. The two gardens in Eine Meerfahrl, one barren and shadowed by rocks, the other neat, green, and 6 Rudolf Ibel, Weltschau deutscher Dichter (Hamburg, 1948), p. 106, states somewhat too sharply; "Die Elemente seiner Dichtung, der Spielraum der Bilder und Situationen sind sehr begrenzt. Wer eine Erz&amp;hlung kennt, kennt sie fast alle." 7 Rene* Wehrli offers a very thorough investigation into the materials of Eichendorff's scenic views in Eichendorfs Erlebnis und Gestaltung der Sinnenwelt, Wege zur Dichtung, xxxn (Frauenfeld/Leipzig, 1938). See also Bollnow, pp. 228-231. In his essay, "Die sym- bolische Formelhaftigkeit von Eichendorffs Prosastil" (in Form und Innerlichkeit, Bern, 1955, pp. 177-209) Werner Kohlschmidt discusses these stereotypic views as genuine poetic topoi, and not just picturesque props.</page><page sequence="8">652 Eichendorff s Symbolic Landscape nestling under a cross, picture not just real estate, but the real state of souls, some dried up, the others fertile because they have been moist- ened by the waters of eternal life. Any attempt at being more explicit about the two gardens would have made their meaning less explicit. To be sure, it is undeniable that the same essential scenic feature, the garden for instance, appears with an almost monotonous frequency in Eichen? dorff's work. Yet the word that it transmits can be made highly variable by a slight rearrangement of its basic elements, just as the same letters in a different sequence result in very different meanings. Let us look at the scenic surroundings of Romana's castle in Ahnung und Gegenwari: "It stood like a mirage high above a vast indescribable chaos of gardens, vineyards, trees, and rivers; the very slope around the manor house was one big garden in which innumerable fountains jetted from the green . . . Strange exotic trees and plants stood there like half-uttered, be- witched thoughts, shimmering water rays crisscrossed in crystal arches high above them, foreign birds, brooding and dreaming, sat everywThere among the dark green shades" (n, 155). We surely recognize every sin? gle feature in this scenery as old acquaintances: the trees and fountains, the exotic birds and flowers. And yet this landscape does have a char? acter and a meaning very much its own. What strikes us is the im? pression of formlessness, the intermingling of land, water, vegetative growth, which all seem to run into one. In fact, the different features of this scenery are quite indistinguishable to our eye?we cannot draw a clear line between them. The slope which the castle crowns is, so we are told, one big garden, but in the preceding line we read that the manor house rises over a blend of gardens, vineyards, trees, and rivers. It is more than mere carelessness when the author pronounces this kaleido- scopic confusion "indescribable"; what we are here dealing with is the unformed, the unarticulated, and it is certainly more than accidental that the trees and plants stand in this tohu-bohu like half-uttered thoughts. We may do well to take quite literally the word "chaos" in our passage, a state in which the elements, not yet separated, shapeless, not bent by the creative command into a clear order, rule supreme. With this we have arrived at the very essence of the mistress of the chaotic garden, of Romana. She is undefined and undefinable, a kaleidoscopic soul in re? volt against the principle of the all-ordering spirit; matter, pure element, which refuses to acknowledge the creative, form-giving will of the Highest. From here stem her strange iridescence, her abrupt and be- wildering appearances and disappearances, her indistinctness uncannily symbolized in the hunting scene where, madly galloping on her steed, she seems to materialize in different places at the same time. As in her garden, the elements, intermingling, not yielding to the hand which makes cosmos out of chaos, hold sway, and it will not surprise us that</page><page sequence="9">Oskar Seidlin 653 after her suicide the consuming element, the fire, breaks loose and destroys her world, her castle. Before the catastrophe occurs Friedrich talks to Romana in her house, and pointing to the scenery which be? comes visible through the windows he exhorts her: "have a good look at the miraculous structure of the century-old trees down there, at the aged giant rocks and the eternal sky above, see how the elements, usually des troy ing each other as enemies, willingly bend their rough, ragged necks and their innate wildness before their Lord, carry and maintain the world in wise order and piety" (n, 223). This is Friedrich's rejection of Romana, but is not the scenery which he points to, the stress on structure, order, clear distinction of forms, a rejection and refutation of Romana's original garden with its blurred outlines, its intermingling of land, water, and vegetation, its inarticulateness and chaos? I hope it has become clear from the foregoing examples that Eichen? dorff's landscapes are not decorative material introduced at will for the sake of background or atmosphere. Yet it is not even enough to state that they are illustrative of metaphysical positions, revealing that "life still unknown" which will become manifest as the story unfolds. They have beyond that a definitely structural function and serve as the joints and hinges on which the whole work moves and swings. The scenic views are like landmarks on a net of coordinates which, if properly connected, represent the curve, the rise, turning point, and fall of the outer and inner action. They are the form into which the concrete is being poured, the scaffold which helps determine shape, angle, and perspective of the edifice. To trace the whole complicated pattern of design is clearly im? possible, yet the demonstration of some points of intersection may elucidate the structural function of Eichendorff's landscapes. On the simplest level the two gardens in Eine Meerfahrt, of which we have spoken, may serve as a case in point. Taken separately, they symbolize pagan and Christian life. Yet if we connect these two landmarks, we arrive at an axis around which the inner and outer action of the story revolves. Again and again, landscape is used as a leitmotif, not only in the sense that we associate previous situations, physical or emotional ad? ventures, with recurring features, but in the very literal sense that they guide us through the layout and the curve of the story. If, for instance, we take the mill of Good-for-nothing's father as a landmark, we can plot the structure of the whole book. Three times the mill appears at the beginning of a chapter, and every time it proclaims readiness and exodus: I'm set to go; set for any place, at the beginning of the first chapter; set for Italy, at the beginning of the third; set for Rome, at the beginning of the seventh. But the same view, the mill in the green valley, also appears three times in the middle of chapters, and then it means: I'm lost, oh were I home!; in the middle of the first chapter when the close air of</page><page sequence="10">654 Eichendorff s Symbolic Landscape the midday heat oppresses our little hero; in the middle of the third when he is about to be caught in the dark forest by the two "robbers"; in the middle of the sixth when he whiles away his days, without aim and direc? tion, in the strange Italian castle. Interestingly enough, after the Good- for-nothing has entered Rome, after the real Rome, the celestial city, has once appeared on the scene, the mill in the father's meadow can vanish from the pages of the book. The remainder, even if it still offers detours and confusion, is denouement, home-coming; the scenic image which signalized the high points of departure to new horizons, the low points of forlornness in the world, is no longer used because it is no longer needed. A glance at Ahnung und Gegenwart may even more convincingly re- veal the structural function of Eichendorff's landscapes, their use in illuminating the pattern and design?all the more illuminating since here the pattern proves extremely complex. At the beginning of the twentieth chapter we read that Friedrich suddenly recognizes the landscape around him as the one where his journey had started at the beginning of the book. Quite literally the story has returned to its origin, Friedrich is again at his starting point. But starting point means home, and man's home is at the same time his destination. Advancing, if it is real advanc- ing and not just running in circles, consists in tracing one's steps back to the origin. And this is exactly what the novel does from this point on: while it advances it traces its steps back, and it is through the reappear- ance of the landscapes that this movement is achieved and organized. The story moves ahead toward its end, the many loose threads of action are now being gathered up and woven into the final pattern and resolu? tion, but the scenery, familiar to us from the beginning, proclaims at every point: we are back again, returning to the origin, approaching home. There is the mill in the dark glade where Friedrich had his first encounter with a hostile world, and now it has reappeared, cleansed of danger and threat; what at his start into the world was a deceptive and treacherous refuge, is now a true and friendly shelter. The landscape of his childhood years, which he conjured up at the beginning of the book in his confessions to Rosa, is present again, really spreading out before him: "Suddenly Friedrich remembered: 'This is my home,' he called out. 'What I see here and all around, everything reminds me like a magic mirror of the place where I grew up as a child. The same forests, the same paths, only the beautiful ancient castle I find no more on the mountain' " (ii, 250). While the line of the story and action declines and falls toward its end, the scene and scenery rise higher and higher until Friedrich will finally reach the top of the mountain, and on it the cross, home and destination, point of origin and terminal in one. It is the landscape that makes the design apparent, design in its double meaning: purpose and aim as well as structure and composition of the narrative.</page><page sequence="11">Oskar Seidlin 655 Here again we have been made aware that the true function of Eichen? dorff's landscapes is the creation of perspectives, the opening up of vistas into the metaphysical depth of his stories, into the organism and pat? tern of his literary designs. And it is the very phenomenon of perspective which offers a most fascinating problem of Eichendorff's presentation of scenery. It has been often and duly noted that his favorite view of the land is from a point above, a total panorama seen from great height.8 The same situation repeats itself in his works over and over: a horseback ride or a walk through the mountains and forests, a sudden clearing in the woods, and there, far below the observer, stretches the green valley with fields, gardens, and villages, and in the distance, but still quite dis? tinct, the shimmering band of a river. Without exaggeration we might call it the Eichendorff perspective. But why is this specific view so per- sistent? It is clear that Eichendorff insists on distance; nature and land? scape are experienced as objects, distinctly removed from the organ through which they are perceived. "Man is," so wre read in Eichendorff's Geschichte des Romans, "so to speak the eye of nature"; while being part of it he sees it as the thing opposite him, he is at every moment actor and spectator in one. Yet this means that his view is in perspective, that he rejects the blissful claim of identity of man and nature which has always been considered the hallmark of romanticism. A scene like the one in Werther?the hero lying in the field, feeling the little blades of grass, the tiny worms and insects pressing against his heart, overcome by the moment "when the world grows dim before my eyes, and earth and sky are absorbed into my soul"?such a scene of mystic exaltation is un- thinkable in Eichendorff, and I suspect he would find it quite revolting.9 He knew nothing of this ardent union with the universe and, through it, the universal spirit which is so overpoweringly expressed in young Goethe's Ganymede-cry "embracing while embraced," this ecstatic fu- sion of subject and object in a quasi-erotic act. Faust's attempt to burrow into the heart of nature is the very opposite of Eichendorff's attitude, of the distance-conscious view from mountain peak down into the valley which is so permanent a feature in his work. Against Faust's exclama- tion "Feeling is all," the superman's empathic dissolution into the great Oneness, Eichendorff would pit a "Seeing is all," watching a spectacle 8 Also noted by Ibel, p. 106. 9 A passage in Ahnung und Gegenwart seems almost a direct refutation of Werther?s self-abandonment in nature, his loving embrace of "blades of grass and tiny worms": "He [Leontin] tried to fall asleep. But when the blades of grass, amidst the incessant and monotonous humming of the bees, moved to and fro over his head ... his heart was oppressed by such an anxiety that he jumped up quickly. He climbed a high tree which stood upon the ridge and rocked himself in its wavering crown over the sultry valley just to rid himself of the terrible stillness in and around him" (n, 102).</page><page sequence="12">656 Eichendorff s Symbolic Landscape offered to our eyes. Indeed, "What a spectacle!" yet Eichendorff wculd never continue with Faust's exasperated and morose complaint "but oh, naught but a spectacle I" All this is, of course, nothing but a corollary to Eichendorff's more basic insistence upon the separation of nature, the created world, and God, the Creator. Ever since the days of the dawning Renaissance God had been drawn into the creation, until finally in the pantheistic creed of identity nature became the direct revelation of the absolute spirit. German romanticism wras a high point in this development; here the complete fusion of the material and the spiritual was proclaimed?God had immersed himself totally into the world. In Novalis' and Schelling's magic idealism matter and spirit are only two different forms of the same substance; Schleiermacher could call nature poetry a manifestation of religion; the great painter Philipp Otto Runge, when making a first sketch for his "Ruhe auf der Flucht," transformed the Biblical scene into pure landscape: Joseph represented by an old, gnarled tree, the Christ Child by a blooming shrub, Mary by a gentle slope to which the shrub is clinging. For Eichendorff, the devout Catholic, such a diviniza- tion of nature amounted to paganism; and I think it is for this reason that his work does not contain the infinite, all-enveloping landscape in which the romanticists reveled, the fusion of the real and the ideal, the temporal and the eternal.10 This explains the great clarity of Eichendorff's scenic views no matter how wide the vista that is being offered. Even the river in the far distance is still distinct; it does not merge with the sky above.11 It has been often noted that one of his favorite landscape features, the garden, has a definite eighteenth-century rococo tinge. But I would take exception to the common explanation that the form and pattern of his gardens were determined by the park of Lubowitz manor, the estate 10 In his authoritative book Die Philosophie der unendlichen Landschaft (Halle, 1932), Helmut Rehder has dealt fully with the gradual rise and ultimate triumph of this fusion in romantic thinking and poetry. He does not overlook the fact that Eichendorff stands outside of this general tendency. Whether he is right in claiming that this "unromantic" attitude toward nature marks Eichendorff as a child of the Biedermeier (p. 194 f.), I am not prepared to argue. The fact as such is undeniable in spite of Bollnow's assertion of Eichendorff's "pantheism" (p. 223), a statement somewhat qualified later (p. 244), and Ibel's remark that Eichendorff "Gott immer wieder als das allumfassende und alldurch- dringende Weltwesen, als die Weltseele, erlebt und erfafit" (p. 133). This "divinization" of the landscape, as revealed in romantic landscape painting, especially in the work of Philipp Otto Runge, is lucidly demonstrated?and rejected from a Catholic point of view? by Otto Georg von Simson in his article, "Philipp Otto Runge and the Mythology of Land? scape," Art Bull., xxrv (Dec. 1942), 335-350.1 am greatly indebted to Professor Simson's exposition. Runge's picture "Ruhe auf der Flucht," to which I referred, is reproduced in this article, both the first sketch and the final version. 111 definitely contradict Ibel's contention that EichendorrFs landscape "meist in eine unermeCliche Ferne miindet" (p. 107).</page><page sequence="13">Oskar Seidlin 657 where he was born and grew up. He needed the rococo garden because its clear arrangement, its distinct form and design point to a gardener in the background, a creator, a supreme maker who has drawn, sketched, and shaped this plot of land. Eichendorff hardly ever allowrs the separat- ing line between heaven and earth to become hazy and melting. To be sure, in his most beautiful poem, "Mondnacht" (i, 306), one of the?shall we say ten?perfect lyrical marvels in the German language, the heavens do kiss the earth. But it seems to me significant that this union of above and below is presented as an unreal condition?"It was as if the heavens/ Had softly kissed the earth"?and that the second stanza with its sharp line-contours, its almost uncannily neat sequence of landscape images, banishes the rluidity and intermingling which is so appropriate to the mystic experience. Eichendorff Js favorite view from on high creates dis? tance between the here and there, it rejects the pantheistic monism of the phenomenal and absolute realms, of being and essence, of life and that which gives life. His nature and landscapes do not embody the mean? ing but they point to the meaning, they have the function of a cipher through which the real, which is the absolute transcendency, can be divined. It may very well be that it was this mode of experiencing the world which induced Dorothea Schlegel to suggest to Eichendorff "Ahnung und Gegenwart" as a suitable title for his first book. Eichendorff's landscape?we stressed this at the very outset?is not revelation, not the manifestation of the eternal spirit, but it is creature, and as such finite and temporal, so much so that one of the most fascinat- ing features of his art is the mysterious correspondence between and coincidence of landscape and time. This is a topic much too comprehen? sive to be discussed here.12 Yet everyone even slightly familiar with Eichendorff will recall how consistently at the climactic point of his stories the image of home, the castle with its gardens and forests, ap? pears, this almost stereotyped landscape which points to youth, origin, to the whole cluster of metaphysical concepts and associations which Eichendorff connects with "origin."18 Landscape and nature envelop time, keep it dormant and enchanted, preserve the past for the future, ready to be reactivated, waiting to be called forth from its hiding place. The numerous ruins, covered with creepers and grass, are not scattered about as picturesque props, but they symbolize lived time which is be? ing kept slumbering or imprisoned by nature. In Ahnung und Gegenwart we read: "When they [Friedrich and Leontin] emerged from the woods 12 A first but most rewarding investigation into the problem of time in Eichendorff's work is to be found in Wilhelm Emrich's "Eichendorff: Skizze einer Asthetik der Ge? schichte," Germanisch-Romanische Monatsschrift, xxvn (July 1939), pp. 192-207. 13 For the importance of "origin" in Eichendorff, see especially the chapter called "Ewige Heimat" in Ibel, pp. 99-125.</page><page sequence="14">658 Eichendorff s Symbolic Landscape and stepped upon a projecting rock, they suddenly saw coming from the miraculous far away distance, from old fortresses and eternal forests the stream of ages past ... the royal river Rhine" (n, 179). The river Rhine is here the "stream of ages past"; it not only conveys and alludes to, but actually is history. And the swim which the two friends take in the river clearly indicates that scenic view stands here for historic event, for the leap into the Rhine takes place in our novel just before the two friends enter upon their soldierly careers and exploits by which Eichen? dorff anticipated the war of liberation against Napoleon. This dive into the Rhine, the stream of ages past, is actually the hero's commitment to and leap into German history. Wrhat is presented here as a scenic view is in reality history, past, present, and future. Through the medium of landscape Eichendorff articulates again and again the perspective of time, its pastness and future encompassed in the present?a time per? spective which in our days has been given such striking expression in the first three lines of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets: Time present and time past Are both perhaps present in time future, And time future contained in time past. Yet this perspective of time which opens up in the landscape, this intermingling, crossing, and blending of past, present, and future as revealed in scenic images, point symptomatically to Eichendorff's basic conviction that nature herself stands within the process and under the dictate of history and time, of that history and time of which all actual history and time is only a preliminary reflection: namely, the history of salvation. Nature, being creature, lives the same cycle, the same possibil- ities of innocence, sin, resurrection, and redemption as does her fellow creature, man. The life of nature as Eichendorff sees and renders it is not primarily the biological rhythm of birth, growth, decay, and death, but the religious tension between distance from God and closeness to grace. In this connection it seems interesting to me that death of and in the scenic surroundings is not rendered by Eichendorff through the common metaphor of winter, which does represent the low point of bios, but through the sultry midday landscape,14 cornfields and woods in their full biological growth, yet oppressed by the heavy, stifling air in which no breath, no anima stirs. It is more than a metaphor when Eichendorff speaks of the "innocent" garden, when the park in SchloB Durande is called "petrified," when, at nightfall, "the world down there in the valley 14 Strangely enough and against overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Bollnow states: "Eichendorffs Weltbild kennt den Tag nicht, oder gar in einem betonten Sinne den Mit- tag" (p. 146).</page><page sequence="15">Oskar Seidlin 659 is locked in a wrestling grip with the huge masses of color" (ii, 251), when he clearly states in his Literaturgeschichte: "Nature is a veiled struggle toward the invisible above her." The same thought is repeated in his essay on the life of St. Hedwig, where we read that "Nature continuously strives from the dead chambers of the earth toward the light, reaching up and, touched by light, breaking out into blossom, fragrance, and song." This is nature working up toward God?but just as often Eichendorff presents us with the opposite view: landscape falling into the depth of the demonic, bound by a spell to the lower regions, elemental in the sense that, as vegetative life, it is pinned down to the earth and does not hear the call and challenge of salvation from above. There are the innumerable enchanted gardens?we met one of them in our discussion of the tempta? tion in the Marmorbild, the green meadow which turns into a crystalline castle in the ballad "Der Gefangene" (i, 347)?the spellbound forests, the paralyzed fields smoldering in the heat of noon. This is nature unre- deemed, caught in its earth-bound origin, cut off from the light above ?again and again the idea appears that these places are submerged, have sunk below the surface, motionless, lifeless. The concept of the enchanted landscape which appears in Eichendorff's work with such persistence is anything but the ubiquitous stock-in-trade used to titillate our nerves and to give us esthetically pleasant goose flesh. "Spellbound" is here to be taken as literally as possible: the state of hypnotic fixation on one's own self, the sinking back into the inside, the dreamy imprisonment in brooding and introspection, in short, a state of life arrested within its own magic circle, and incapable of breaking through its own shell. Its most profound pictorial representation seems to me Durer's "Melencolia" with her sad, gazing eyes, a world under the sign of Saturn, the earth- god, touched by the dead hour, filled with the fearful stillness of oblivion. What this landscape needs to return to life is a shock, a sudden act of awakening, a quick tearing away of the heavy shroud. And this is exactly what it gets again and again in Eichendorff's work. Here we may find the answer to the question why Eichendorff so persistently pre- fers one specific mode of daybreak. It is literally a break, stressing the suddenness, the almost explosive quality, the momentous act of awaken? ing. There is no lingering in the twilight zone, no slow seeping through of the light; Eichendorff's morning comes not with a whimper but with a bang. It seems to me much more than an idiosyncratic formula w7hen we read over and over in his works: the sun w&amp;sjust rising, at this very mo? ment the sun rose, always the emphasis on the shock, on the active and activating moment of day's arrival. For Eichendorff it is the first ray that matters, the ray into which the lark throws herself, rising higher and higher, almost drunk with the feeling of being awake. This is more than</page><page sequence="16">660 Eichendorff's Symbolic Landscape just morning; this is the moment of resurrection when the first ray of grace suddenly touches the dark, sleeping landscape.15 Thus EichendorfTs landscapes are not simply props, not simply back? ground against which a play is being enacted; they are, as much as man himself, dramatis personae, the drama being the miracle play of God and his creation. His stage is a genuine gran teatro del mundo?it is certainly not accidental that he dedicated himself so assiduously to the translation of Calder6n?and rivers, gardens, mountains, and woods play their roles in the great action. That they are so much alive, not with borrowed but with their own life, gives EichendorfTs natural scenery a vitality and concreteness which is probably unmatched in German literature. Yet this very liveliness has given rise to the misconception that EichendorfTs landscape is thoroughly anthropomorphic, that he transfers human situa? tion, emotions, and problems to the scenery which surrounds man. I do not think that this is the case, although I realize that a good deal of what I have presented earlier may have given credence to the anthropo- morphism of EichendorfTs landscape. To be sure, we can read man's ultimate condition, and this is his relationship to God, the readiness or unreadiness of his soul, from the countenance of a garden and a heath, from a pond and a ravine in whose shadow a mill is hidden. But this close connection is not established by a simple reflection of the human in nature. The bond is not created by a projection or transference of one upon the other, but by the concept of analogy, the very principle which in the Scholastic philosophy of an Aquinas furnishes the link between the divine, the human, and the natural. It is not the relationship of a model to its reflection in a mirror, but it is a system of vast and subtle corre? spondences, a multiple design of perspectives all of which point to the ulti? mate question: What is the meaning and destiny of life as God created it? Correspondences and perspectives: this seems the answer which, on different levels, our inquiry into the symbolism of EichendorfTs land? scape has yielded. But if this answer is correct, then it is evident that landscape is not just a material ingredient inserted at will, and capable of being viewed, enjoyed, and recognized per se, but that it is of a structural nature, not merely content but formal principle through which the mate? rials used are organized into a work of art. It is not an element subjec- tively chosen by the author for his creation, but it objectively determines the meaningful design of the organism of which it is a part. By sharpen- ing my argument to this point, I may make the polemic undertone of my 15 What morning means to Eichendorff (especially in the Taugenichts) is clearly brought out by Kunz, pp. 75-77; also Ibel, p. 138. When my article was in proof I came across Richard Alewyn's superb interpretation of "Eine Landschaft Eichendorffs" (Euphorion, li, Jan. 1957, 42-60), which, starting from a typical morning scene, develops the very es? sence of Eichendorff's "Raumgeftthl."</page><page sequence="17">Oskar Seidlin 661 interpretation too clearly audible. It is directed against a view, especially rampant in the Anglo-Saxon countries and authoritatively expounded by T. S. Eliot and his discipies, who reject the works of the romanticists? and Eichendorff is certainly one of them?as a mass of unorganized, sub- jective feelings, unverifiable because they are a matter of purely personal expression, a release of moods to which we may or may not respond with our nerves, but which do not guide us toward meaning and truth. The romanticists are, in the eyes of these denigrators, anathema because they exhaust themselves in the uncontrollable and irresponsible play of fancy, lead to a debasement of creative imagination and form, and, in? stead of sharpening our mind and eye for the universals, becloud them with the shapeless fog of the particulars. I hope I have been able to show, by one specific demonstration, how baseless and unjust such a view is. It stems, so it seems to me, from a vulgarized and cheapened form of roman? ticism as it spread after the real and creative impetus of the movement had spent itself. But these more or less tasteful arrangers of atmospheric details for their own sake, these users of empty props and meaningless effects are not the true heirs of the genuine German romanticists. Their true heirs live in a camp to which T. S. Eliot is, and knows himself to be, greatly indebted: the camp of the French symbolists.16 Their concern, as passionate as EichendorfTs, was to illuminate the word, the cipher that appears on the face of the visible world, to let us divine the truth which is encoded in the hieroglyph. It may very well be that my whole presenta? tion is nothing more than a clumsy elaboration on the two quatrains of Baudelaire's sonnet: La nature est un temple ou de vivants piliers Laissent parfois sortir de confuses paroles; L'homme y passe a travers des forets de symboles Qui l'observent avec des regards familiers. Comme de longs echos qui de loin se confondent Dans une tenebreuse et profonde unite, Vaste comme la nuit et comme la clarte, Les parfums, les couleurs et les sons se repondent. Are we surprised at the discovery that the title of this poem reads: " Correspondances"?
