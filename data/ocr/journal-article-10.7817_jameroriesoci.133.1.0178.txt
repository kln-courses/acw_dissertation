She argues that attention  to the concept of rebellion in the royal texts increased during periods in which there was a danger of  rebellion. She also studies the nature of these texts, which were hymns used in the scribal school at  Nippur, perhaps to encourage restraint in rulers. Oddly, the praise poems from Ur concerning Rim-Sin  are different in nature, perhaps representing a variety of layers of factors. Amanda H. Podany (“Preventing Rebellion through the Creation of Symbolic Ties of Kinship in  Syria and Mesopotamia during the Second Millennium b.c.”) studies the Mari letters, showing the  mode of resistance by non-royals against the Mari monarchy. She proceeds to discuss symbolic terms,  specifically the “Hem of the Garment.” For example, an underling who severed the hem of a garment  was acting in rebellion. Conversely, “seizing the hem of the garment” was a symbolic way of describ- ing the relationship of an underling to a more powerful ruler. Similarly, “tying the hem” signified an  alliance (or treaty) between monarchs. Of course, these phrases originated in the household environ- ment. Thus, family ties were meant to diminish the possibility of rebellion amongst subordinates (and  equals), a strategy that met with varying success.  Raymond Westbrook (“The Law and Politics of Rebellion in the Late Bronze Age”) studies the  concept of rebellion in the Amarna letters, using the case of Aziru. Since Aziru ruled over Amurru,  a kingdom on the frontier between Egypt and Hatti, the Egyptian monarch had to maintain a balance  between possible defection to Hatti and military engagement with this northern enemy. The same held  true for the Hittite monarchs concerning the kingdom of Kizzuwatna, which had switched allegiance  from Mitanni to Hatti. Sarah C. Melville (“Kings of Tabal: Politics, Competition, and Conflict in a Contested Periphery”)  focuses on an Anatolian peripheral area to show how a region far from the Assyrian center was able  to thrive. Employing Wallerstein’s World-Systems Theory, Melville articulates three stages of devel- opment of the relationship between Assyria and Tabal: 1) Tabal as the object of Assyrian aggression,  2) Tabal as a client state, and 3) Tabal as a province of the Assyrian state. With the threat of invasion  by Urartu, the Assyrians became more interested in this region, and thus committed more time and  effort to it. Melville thus creates a paradigm (based upon admittedly biased Assyrian sources) showing  that Assyrian involvement in this area was dependent upon distance, topography, and the potentiality  of threat (by Tabalian powers or by Urartu). In editing this very innovative and imaginative volume, Seth Richardson has done a great service in  furthering the study of social history in the ancient Near East, as well as in expanding the avenues of  inquiry. Certainly this volume will be a catalyst for further research and critique. Mark W. Chavalas University of Wisconsin-La Crosse Altorientalische Kleinfunde. By Eva Strommenger and Peter A. Miglus. Ausgrabungen in Tall  Biʿa/Tuttul, vol. 5. Wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichungen der Deutschen Orient-Gesellschaft, vol.  126. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2010. Pp. ix + 323, plates. €98. The latest installment of the excavation reports of the German-Syrian archaeological project at the  third-second millennium b.c.e. settlement of Tell Bi’a (ancient Tuttul) in Syria presents the small finds.  Previously published volumes have focused on the architecture and stratigraphy, texts, and seals, while  an upcoming publication will cover the ceramics. The present volume 5 collects and presents full infor- mation on small objects manufactured from clay/terracotta, stone, metal, bone/ivory, and various other  materials. An introduction, two bibliographies, a catalog of published objects ordered by find numbers,  and, of course, copious illustrations round out the publication. Excavation director Eva Strommenger and several of her colleagues take the reader through chap- ter 2, devoted to the clay/terracotta objects, perhaps the most interesting category of artifacts due to  its size, diversity, and issues of interpretation. The objects are presented in a standard typological  </page> <page sequence="2"> Reviews of Books 179 format, encompassing the categories of anthropomorphic and theriomorphic figurines, models of wag- ons/chariots, daily objects and architecture, musical instruments like pipes, incense burners, utensils  like baking plates, and, interestingly, several model livers that apparently report the results of actual  hepatoscopies. The typological division of these objects generally makes sense, though as is often the  case, there are outliers that don’t fit in the group to which they are assigned (e.g., the figurine in Taf.  7.15 looks different stylistically from the other exemplars in its group, K2a; Group K6, to take another  example, seems to be a grab-bag). Even after the extensive excavation at the site, the chronology of the figurines and possible chang- es between the Early Dynastic and Akkadian periods remain problematic (p. 5). This is unfortunate,  because this kind of everyday object—with its various different manufacturing techniques and stylistic  groupings—might be sensitive enough to provide some indication as to whether or not the material cul- ture changed noticeably in the wake of the appearance of an expansive and militarily dominant power. Small but interesting discussions appear throughout the text raising questions— including very basic  ones—about these objects’ social ramifications. What was the function(s) of the ubiquitous anthropo- morphic figurines? Were the different types of figures used by different social groups (e.g., religious  communities, economic classes, ethnic groups)? Strommenger dismisses the ideas that they were toys,  were used in magic rituals, or were part of the ancestral cult, preferring instead to see them as repre- sentations of gods and goddesses (pp. 6–7). Though we need not assume that all of these objects had  the same function (so, perhaps, some of these objects might have been toys after all), the idea that  these figures were dispensed by the temple (p. 7) raises further questions about religious structure in  the ancient Near East and the relationship of the laity to the priesthood. Other questions could be raised  about the theriomorphic and model figurines. Clearly, the issue of these figurines requires much more  work, though more recent efforts have begun this task. Chapter 3, written by excavation co-director Peter Miglus, presents the stone objects from the site.  This category includes a variety of everyday implements, such as vessels, tools, weapons, and assorted  other pieces (e.g., spindle whorls). Most interesting, however, are the stone reliefs and sculpture-in-the- round, further evidence of artistic endeavor (or at least appreciation) at the site. One basalt fragment  (Taf. 179.1) derives from a stele of a male figure with a square beard; though, as Miglus points out,  there may be no close comparanda (p. 157), its overall style could place it in the Middle Bronze Age.  Another fragment of a beard appears carved in an Early Dynastic style (Taf. 179.3); Miglus believes it  was brought in from Ebla or the surrounding area, based on parallels with sculpture there (p. 157), but  there is no evidence for this. The idea seems to be that “nice” objects had to be imported, while cruder  sculpture (e.g., Taf. 180.1) was locally produced (p. 157), a strange automatic assumption, especially  considering the wealth indicated by the presence of gold and silver at the site (see below). Miglus also discusses the metal objects in the following chapter 4. These mostly comprise tools,  weapons, and jewelry made of copper and bronze, though a few artifacts of gold, silver, and lead were  also recovered. Not surprisingly, most of these pieces were recovered from the site’s burials and not  in everyday contexts (p. 159). Furthermore, the metal objects found outside the graves exhibit greater  variety than those deriving from them. Strommenger takes the reader through the last two chapters, devoted to the bone and ivory (5) and  assorted small jewelry parts made from a variety of materials, including snail shell, frit, mother of  pearl, and stone (6). The former includes mostly everyday items, such as sewing needles, pins and awls,  and implements like spatulas, while the latter includes mostly spacers and beads (some of which are  carved in delightful animal shapes). There are also several larger and more intricate pieces, including  an ivory of a nude female figure carved in the style of the site’s terracottas (Taf. 200.2) and a small  cylindrical pyxis (Taf. 200.1). Overall, the book is beautifully presented and contains much useful information. Each class of  object is introduced with general remarks about the materials and detailed commentary about manufac- turing techniques. The inclusion of an index of objects arranged sequentially by find number (section  8) ensures that the reader who finds something interesting while browsing the illustrations can easily  locate the appropriate description in the text. The line drawings and photographs are of the highest  quality and easy to use. </page> <page sequence="3"> 180 Journal of the American Oriental Society 133.1 (2013) Nevertheless, there are several points that negatively impact this publication’s usefulness. Two of  the biggest concern chronological and spatial distribution of the artifacts. First, information on dat- ing is not readily available for individual objects or groups thereof. Although the majority of finds  derive from third-millennium contexts (which, at Tell Biʿa, themselves represent the Early Dynastic,  Akkadian, and so-called “shakkanaku” periods), occasionally objects from second-millennium levels  (such as Palace A) appear in the discussion without being clearly designated (e.g., p. 179). Although  the current publication is intended to be used with the other series volumes, including information on  the chronology of the objects, even if problematic or provisional, would have reduced the necessity  for the reader to keep referring to a large stack of unwieldy books. Second, maps showing the spatial  distribution of the objects are also lacking. These would permit the reader to see if there are any notice- able clusters of artifacts by area. Finally, although this issue is not limited to the book under review, such publications, due to their  cost and inherent limitations, raise another matter: that of online/internet publication. Excavation  reports seem to be especially suited to this medium: readers generally consult them for specific infor- mation and illustrations on particular stratigraphic levels and relationships, on objects (e.g., manufac- turing technique, style, chronology), and architecture, and not for general background information.  Reports that are searchable and easily accessible would thus greatly facilitate extracting information as  quickly and easily as possible—and would be much cheaper as well. Nevertheless, Altorientalische Kleinfunde is a good example of a timely and well-presented final  excavation report, and the information therein will be welcomed by everyone interested in the third  and second millennia in Syria. Brian Brown University of California, Berkeley Textile Terminologies in the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean from the Third to the First Millen- nia BC. Edited by C. Michel and M.-L. Nosch. Ancient Textile Studies, vol. 8. Oxford UK and  Oakville, CT: Oxbow Books, 2010. Pp. xix + 444, illus. $70. Textile production comprised the major manufacturing industry of the ancient Near East and eastern  Mediterranean, yet it has received relatively little scholarly attention. As garments and furnishings, tex- tiles may provide warmth and utility, but they are also indicators of status, objects of trade and tribute,  products of technology, and economic generators. The role of textiles is both pervasive and complex,  yielding rich and specific vocabularies that do not easily transcend time and space for contemporary  understanding. This brilliant volume offers a compilation of twenty-two papers that result from an  exciting collaboration between the Danish National Research Foundation’s Centre for Textile Research  and a project of the French Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, specifically “The Economy of  Wool in the Ancient Near East,” which was launched in 2005 by the Histoire et Archéologie de l’Orient  Cuneiforme (HAROC). This publication, the eighth in a series of Ancient Textile Studies, arises from  an exploratory workshop that took place in Copenhagen in 2009 with sponsorship of the European  Science Foundation. Packed with interesting ideas, critical approaches, and new theoretical frameworks, the papers  reviewed here address textile terminologies in different languages and cultures of the ancient Near  East and eastern Mediterranean. Considering that terminologies are text-based, the editors have taken  literally and prudently the third-to-first millennium focus within which written materials augment the  archaeological record. But the breadth of the materials covered extends back to the ninth millennium,  far beyond evidence of written sources. The collective value of these papers exemplifies the highest  scholarly standards and the strength of collaborative scholarship engaging different disciplinary per- spectives. The project reflects the visionary guidance of the editors in developing a technological base  of understanding through observation, experimentation, and critical evaluation of the archaeological  </page> </plain_text>
