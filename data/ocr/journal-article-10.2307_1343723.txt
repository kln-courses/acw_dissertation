<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Erotics of Irishness Cheryl Herr Like all fields of inquiry, Irish studies has its own traditions, its own ways of organizing information. Even the most adventurous of the native practitioners tend carefully to maintain disciplinary boundaries when presenting evidence to sustain a thesis, and American scholars have used Irish practice as their frame of reference. This essay, which engages with the time-honored and increasingly vexed enterprise of defining "Irishness," introduces play into these traditions both in spirit and in methodology. An alternative approach to analyzing Ireland might foreground the underlying assumptions about social relations and historical patterns that link Irish art and writing across diverse fields of inquiry.' Exploring the many rhetorics of Ireland might make it impossible, for example, for those involved in the essential task of historical and scientific inquiry-the realm commonly construed as that of hard facts-to overlook the submessages of popular Irish representa- tions. I begin, obliquely, with a contrast between American and Irish 1. Richard Kearney has been by far the most successful organizer of multidiscipli- nary studies of Irish life. The authors in his recent collection of essays, Across the Frontiers: Ireland in the 1990s (Dublin, 1988), examine the place of Ireland in the 1992 Eurostate in ways that aggressively complicate cultural, political, and economic perspectives on contemporary Ireland. The volume, however, seeks more to initiate discussion than to produce an integrated analysis across various terrains. In terms of introducing an exter- nal perspective, many of the issues referred to in this essay receive much fuller consideration in my study in progress "Significant Space: Ireland by Design."

My inquiry targets some fundamental differences between American and Irish appropriations of the body, from which the essay suggests symmetries between the psychological development of individuals in Ireland and one stage in what might be termed the psychohistory of Irish culture. As an experimental, semi- disruptive piece that challenges disciplinary lines in the field and introduces fresh theoretical categories, this essay reaches toward a new Irish studies. Videologic in America In 1984 Stuart Arbright, a musician based in New York, copro- duced with feminist filmmaker Beth B a video of his successful cut Cheryl Herr, associate professor of English at the University of Iowa, has published Joyce's Anatomy of Culture (1986) and For the Land They Loved: Irish Political Melodramas, 1890-1925 (1990).

"The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight" (figs. 1 and 2). Although the record and video alluded to sadomasochistic themes, Arbright and B had consciously worked toward what they called a "subtle," "conceptual" package.2 On the evening that the video was to be aired on ABC's "Hot Tracks," Arbright and friends quickly realized that despite frequent teasers, the cut was going to be pulled. Following suit, MTV told B that the visuals were "too hot" and showed "too much skin." When Arbright and B refused to "tone down" the work, MTV continued their boycott. This action surprised Arbright. Yes, the video appears to be set in an urban jungle village populated by powerful women; yes, it toys with deprivation and sadism (the women keep their men locked up, comi- cally, in a body shop and obviously have the upper hand when it comes to driving the cars that represent power in their social order). But Arbright insists that clubgoers did not pick up on the more sexually violent interpretive possibilities. When they discovered that the video's 2.

Arbright believes that, sadomasochism aside, it was actually "the idea of a woman being in power" that "freaked" network broadcasters. In 1985, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, put on a music video retrospective. One of the thirty works chosen for exhibition, "Dominatrix" had found an audience far more exclusive than the one originally targeted; the work was displayed next to a Miles Davis cut. Soon after, Paris's Pompidou Center showcased "Dominatrix" while alluding to American commercial hypocrisy.s Widely distributed in England, the Netherlands, West Germany, and Ireland, this Arbright/ B venture also won acclaim at the Berlin Film Festival. Among the many things that one might say about this series of events is that the kind of censorship experienced by Arbright and B demonstrates a still-existing lag in America between legislative or everyday notions of what the body is and the digitized or cyborgian technobody, with its casual unity and its ready absorption into cartoon graphics. If videologists are at all correct in hailing the subsuming of our historical "event horizon"4 into a world that could not exist outside of the small screen, the growing absurdity of much if not all censoring of video body images becomes apparent. But while MTV increasingly takes place on a two-dimensional, information-dense videoplane that insists on its self-referentiality, the audience and programmers some- times still watch through a porthole framed by nostalgia. Vivian Sobchack addresses this situation using a tripartite struc- ture.5 In our "moving image culture," we "live cinematic and electronic lives," she argues, complete with an appropriately altered "psycho- 3. It would seem that the Pompidou has become a place of imprimatur for works produced in the uncongenially censored settings outside of France. Gordon Lambert believes that despite setbacks in the past, the aesthetic "potential in Ireland is limitless," and notes, "We have come a long way from the conservative academic objection to a Henry Moore reclining figure, presented to the Dublin Municipal Gallery over two decades ago, to Nigel Rolfe's naked body performances in flour which have earned contemporary Irish art recognition in the Pompidou Centre!" (Gordon Lambert, "A Matrix of Contemporary Irish Visual Art," in Ireland and the Arts, ed. Tim Pat Coogan [London, 1983], pp. 204, 205). 4. See The Event Horizon: Essays on Hope, Sexuality, Social Space, and Media(tion) in Art, ed. Lorne Falk and Barbara Fischer (Toronto, 1987), which maps the world of video representation from several angles toward a utopianism based in representation. 5. The quotations from Sobchack in this paragraph are from the manuscript of an essay, forthcoming in Post Script (Autumn 1990), that was translated and first published in German. The English title is "Scene of the Screen: Toward a Phenomenology of Cine- matic and Electronic 'Presence.'" The German version is "The Scene of the Screen: Beitrag zu einer Phainomenologie der 'Gegenwairtigkeit' im Film und in den elektron-</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1990 5 logic" and "bio-logic." The most extreme of these altered states is the electronic, for here we find a new sense of "presence" that incorporates users "in a spatially decentered, weakly temporalized and quasi-disem- bodied state" and subjects them to "the transmission of random information." It is this flattened, superficial, binary, antigravitational, electronic state that is not fully available-not visible-in certain under- or more recently developed countries. Before the electronic body, before the cinematic body, there was the photographic bio-logic, which rendered "a presence in the present that is always past," recording the traces of loss, death, and nostalgia that are neutralized in videophe- nomenology. In many ways, the Ireland that produced Finnegans Wake seemed if not well on its way at least amenable to postmodernism (however restricted to the realm of "culture") and to deconstructive literary strat- egies, but despite the transnational status of patriarchy and profit motives, Ireland even now uneasily integrates first-world biotechnology and third-world politico-economics. Still battling the old cycle of poverty and emigration, Ireland stands at but definitely outside the threshold of postindustrial posthumanism-even while works like "The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight" paradoxically play, i Irish clubs without comment. What keeps Ireland keyed into the photographic dimension in most of its cultural registers? What keeps this video outside the current censorship-danger zone in Ireland? What determines an Irish version of the Dominatrix that is entirely different from Arbright/B's American woman? By examining closely one moment in Irish art history and folding into its frame evocative materials from anthropology, literary criticism, and archaeology, I want to suggest the almost unthinkable (from the outside) gap separating Irish and American representations of body- experience. As we move in and out of a few select Irish spaces-an art museum, a rural village, the city of Dublin, and a prehistoric burial mound on the river Boyne-we see displayed the neutralization of the body in this island culture and some meanings of that desomatizing in Ireland's historical and current identity crisis.6 ischen Medien," in Materialitait der Kommunikation, ed.

Although my comparison of Irish and American body images sometimes affirms the critique of institutionalized gender relations advanced by Irish feminists, my primary aim is not to criticize the pattern of relations in Ireland nor to promote the erotics of American society. I am much more interested in enhancing for international students of Irish studies the differences between the two cultures as a way of valuing the distinctive- ness of Ireland and of the people who live there.</page><page sequence="6">6 Cheryl Herr The Erotics of Irishness Irish Minds in Irish Bodies I didn't know I was Irish until I went to America.7 -U2's BONO Most writers on Ireland sooner or later put forward one trait that they see as definitive of the "Irish mind" or the "Celtic consciousness."8 This characteristic is thought to reproduce itself throughout the cultural fabric across time and space. Hence, the Irish are variously linked to a fatal divisiveness and "emotional oscillation," a "split- mindedness" that becomes a genius for "dispersion and disconnexion" as well as an "incapacity to generalize."' Various forms of doubling are frequently put forward as somehow intrinsic to Irishness, as are a strong "sense of place"'1 and a "funerary" obsession." How to read these efforts at self-definition without falling prey to essentialism or oversimplification is a critical question; that said, there is no doubt that Ireland is increasingly in the throes of what might be called an "over- identity crisis.""12 But one feature that almost no one mentions is the relationship between the Irish mind and any kind of Irish body. The identity-obses- sion marks a social repression of the body on a grand scale. As I see it, the loss occurs on both individual and collective levels. Ireland has liter- ally eroded, in the sphere of representations that constitute social identity, a comfortable sense of the body;'" in traditional as well as in colonial and postcolonial Ireland, the body has frequently been asso- 7.

I am not suggesting that the actual physical experience of any individual in Ireland is or is not different from the sensory experience in other countries or that if this were the case, a non-Irish viewer would be able to detect this difference. Ethnographic studies (for example, see Nancy Scheper-Hughes's Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics: Mental Illness in Rural Ireland [Berkeley, 1979]; hereafter abbreviated S) lend some support to the possibility of censored sensation in certain parts of Ireland, but such conclusions are highly controversial. What I would rather direct attention to are the ways in which a collective Irish body text, composed of repeated descriptions and received ideas, implies the ongoing force of code-systems that appear to be uncharacteristic of body representations in the United States. This is a point that seems, judging from many discussions of body texts, icriturefeminine, and the like, to be easily ignored or effaced.</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1990 7 ciated representationally with danger and has been scrutinized with an intensity that stills (photographically). And as I will try to show, the academic world's portrayal of a powerful prehistory dialectically repli- cates that situation in the framework of psychohistory. What is thought of as the "typically Irish" embracing of censorship (something that appears to but does not conflict with the acceptance of the Arbright/B video in Ireland) throughout modern history iterates these ideologi- cally linked losses as a sign of cultural trauma or denial. Although this is not the place to go into detail, the arc of James Joyce's writing career shows his increasingly acute analysis of this social systematizing of repression, compensatorily troped as immobility. From his own experi- ence of having Dubliners censored, Joyce produced both Ulysses, which centers on the suddenly unsuppressed Dominatrix (Molly's monologue hinting at a folklore-based Gea-Tellean power that Joyce apparently chose to honor at some level), and Finnegans Wake, which reclaims the prehistoric, evaded moment that it calls the "annadominant."'4 Tracing the sources and meanings of his pain, anger, exile, and dualism took Joyce unerringly along the channels of Irish psychohistory-back to the most obvious feature of Ireland-as-body: the mounds, cairns, tumuli, and generally massive circular field monuments visually organ- izing large portions of Irish geography. In the Wake Joyce allows these womb-grave-body-parts to stand in for a missing link in Irish identity, the moment that might replace the perception of paralysis with a cele- bration of movement.'5 Let me note here that the sort of interpretation that I have in mind veers away from the often fruitful but to me unwieldily universal 14. James Joyce, Finnegans Wake (New York, 1967), p. 14; hereafter abbreviated FW. Several commentators on Joyce have moved in various ways and degrees toward accounting for the portrayal in the Wake of the archaic "annadominant" but without fully considering the highly contextual and psychohistorical motivation for Joyce's quite remarkable inquiry into Irish prehistory. More important, the connection between Joyce's inquiry and the larger patterns of Irish discourse and Irish censorship has not been pursued. See Bonnie Kime Scott, Joyce and Feminism (Bloomington, Ind., 1984), chap. 2, and James Joyce (Atlantic Highlands, N.J., 1987), chap. 4; John Bishop,Joyce's Book of the Dark, "Finnegans Wake" (Madison, Wis., 1986); and Margot Norris, The Decentered Universe of "Finnegans Wake": A Structuralist Analysis (Baltimore, 1976). 15. When Julia Kristeva talks about Joyce (see her essay, "Joyce 'The Gracehoper' or the Return of Orpheus," in James Joyce: The Augmented Ninth, ed. Bernard Benstock [Syracuse, N.Y., 1988], pp. 167-80), she claims that he deliberately opened himself to multiple identities in an attempt to backtrack, to understand the identification process with all of its ambiguities. She traces processes of individual psychosocial development as that development relates to the production of literature. Always there is the surfacing of the maternal and archaic in displaced ways that have aesthetic outcomes. It is interesting that Kristeva entertains what this process might have looked like on the purely social level and sees the two processes as congruent. The moment of retrieval of the archaic aligns, I think, with the moment in which the Prankquean appears. She takes on the role of condenser, displacer, and irrepressible feminine principle. Knocking at the door, she is</page><page sequence="8">8 Cheryl Herr The Erotics of Irishness attempts to reclaim the "goddess" in any given cultural setting. We're moving more in the direction of Julia Kristeva's abject, of an excess that speaks and threatens and suffers repression in an endless micro-macro cycle. In my consideration of Irish culture, I call this conceptual space the arkhein.'6 Arkhein is, conveniently, a bracketed term in the American Heritage Dictionary's list of Indo-European roots. It is a Greek verb "of unknown origin" meaning to begin, to rule, to command. Its deriva- tives include archaic and archive. Given that the AHD presents the Indo- European roots as the "prehistory" of English, arkhein seems to me a suitably remote, uncertain, and gender-free term to signify elements that might be variously expressed through ideas such as Kristeva's abject or semiotic or chora, Freud's Minoan moment, the primarily filmic sense of a nonpatriarchal imaginary, a (m)other tongue, the speaking of Luce Irigaray's "two lips," any version of a pre-Oedipal semiotic (in Kristeva's sense) that sweeps up the possibility of segueing into a matri-symbolic or alternative primary code. (Although most of these terms are woman- identified and although the ideological positioning of women in Ireland lends support to my argument, I would suggest that the projected cate- gory be taken as a fluidly ungendered alternative to the symbolic as we know it.) As I think will become clear, interpreting the Arbright/B video might send me for analytic tools to post-structuralist theorists, to Jane Gallop, Angela Carter, and the post-Freudian literature on phallic mothers, but I have to go through different frames of reference to draw forth Ireland's Dominatrix-Body-as arkhein, as Kathleen Ni Houlihan, as Queen Medb, as the formidably misunderstood Irish Mother, as a pervasive Irish resistance to achieving cultural identity in the terms that those outside of Irish society often deem necessary." the domineering, primitive Kathleen Ni Houlihan, refusing to be deterred in her quest but, as yet metaphorically presymbolic, unable to express the quest very clearly. It is, like Ireland's own quest, a search for identity. The Wake signals in many ways the site of a loss that is associated with lack of movement and of erotic pleasure. 16. Arkhein echoes the Heideggerian arche or ground, but the arkhein has less to do with Being than with a specifically cultural archaic. As a bracketed root, arkhein carries the connotation of being constructed, projected backward into a linguistic prehistory that is highly fluid and open to meanings, pregendered, presymbolic, alternative. I prefer the more aggressively manufactured root to describe the presymbolic zone in Irish history. 17. Many commentators appear to conduct their research on Ireland with a preconceived notion of what the Irish should do and, as an implied corollary, what Irish identity ought to look like. This is true of writers who are Irish as well as of those who are not. Most often, those who are in varying degrees outsiders (including many Irish-Ameri- cans) tend to have a nostalgic sense of Irish culture that privileges old ways and communi- cates a desire for the old ways to be reclaimed. Another example of kindly bias comes forward in Elizabeth Shannon's I Am of Ireland: Women of the North Speak Out (Boston, 1989), in which she argues that Irish women, north and south, should band together under the banner of feminism, refuse to cooperate in the masculinist conflicts that she finds at the heart of the political crisis. Shannon discerns in that ongoing conflict an Irish male compensation for a history of unemployment and emotional insecurity. One prob-</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1990 9 ........

Madonna Irlanda Which brings us to Micheal Farrell, one of Ireland's foremost contemporary visual artists, a painter who reminds many Americans of Larry Rivers. His painting, Madonna Irlanda or "The Very First Real Irish Political Picture" (fig. 3),18 iconographically reinscribes, some fifty years after the fact, Joyce's highly charged analysis of the Irish annadominant lem with such an argument is that Shannon tends to discount the opinions of Irish women with whom she disagrees. Another problem is the peculiarly one-dimensional and nondynamic nature of the feminism that she espouses. It is difficult to imagine how her proposed solution could be put into practice across the incredibly complex field of Irish life in the two countries. 18.

Because Farrell's career mapped, prior to Madonna Irlanda, his own movement from an interna- tional style to a concern with native tradition-particularly motifs that privilege swirling, circularity, and concentricity in the manner of Celtic brooches and prehistoric burial mounds'9-it is at first all the more surprising that the artist's announced formulation of an alternative style cycled him into what seems like a predictable stasis; the painterly persona warily approaches the Irish body (always construed as threaten- ing domination, however mildly disposed) through a dense visual program. The painting is at once a gathering of contemporary Irish icons, a history of perspectival Western art, and a self-portrait of the artist. In the work, Farrell himself stares hostilely at his own semi- discarded pictorial modes, the traces of Celticism popularly attributed to the Irish mind, and a space that Irish art has left mostly vacant through the centuries (akin to that abysmal dream-space that Freud detected, a possibly Minoan and unrepresentable pre-Oedipality). Farrell's change of style or heart found expression in the Miss O'Murphy series, of which Madonna Irlanda is a major example. The series involves various takes on the nudes of the eighteenth- century French painter Francois Boucher. Why Boucher rather than Rubens or Ingres or Picasso? A 1978 lithograph by Farrell provides one answer; it depicts a Boucher nude outlined on a smeared and blotched background, with the printed title in the upper left corner, "LES NOUVELLES COUPES DE BOUCHERIE A LA MODE IRLAN- DAISE." Farrell labeled the young woman's body to designate the appropriate political cuts-"gigot," "le cul," "fourquarters," "kneecap" (especially important to Northern political groups). Butchered by the history of Irish politics, she rests there, sanctified in the public eye by her own willingness not to know her violation. The picture perfectly extends the plan of Jonathan Swift, Boucher's Irish contemporary, whose modest proposal still finds in Ireland the occasional reader who cannot see the point.20 But there is more to this series of paintings than such an obvious satiric pun. Boucher (1703-70) sums up perfectly the century in which he reigned as court painter for Louis XV, its comfortable decadence, its intrigues and careful avoidance of distressing immediacies. He chroni- the space and quiet in which I wrote this essay. I am also grateful to Ruth Salvaggio of Virginia Tech for discussions about feminism and archaeology.

While Norman Bryson eloquently defines Boucher's role in producing this body capable of being "consumed in the moment of the glance,"21 Boucher's nudes strike many critics more as brimming with health than as inspiring possessive desire; they seem too impersonal to be at all scandalous, too benign to be censorable (despite the historical rumor that the king's mistress commissioned Boucher to paint these nudes for Louis's personal "musee secret"),22 too limp to engage, in fact. These cherubic bodies yield most to the pressures of rococo design, floating through scene after scene of emotional detachment, rarely making eye contact. Their gazes go inward, with the look we find in small children, in baby ducks. Boucher's Blonde Odalisque (fig. 4), to which Madonna Irlanda directly alludes, has this tensionless, fluid, generic attitude. An Irish artist would likely be drawn to the Odalisque because of the story that Boucher used for his model a fourteen-year-old Irish courtesan, "Mademoiselle O'Murphy," of whom Casanova speaks approvingly in his memoirs and who was briefly the paramour of Louis XV.2" Farrell provides his own discursive analysis of the Miss O'Murphy phenome- non; he uses the pictures to "'make every possible statement on the Irish situation, religious, cultural, political, the cruelty, the horror, every aspect of it.'" Why Mother Ireland? he was asked. "'Because she is a whore.' "24 Lest I get sidetracked in Stephen Dedalus's generic, "all-too-Irish" preoccupation with the cult of the virgin, which contains its own decon- structive underside (or in the many analyses across cultures of the virgin-whore dichotomy to which women have so often been subject- ed),25 I want to keep the focus on how art historians have viewed Boucher's lady and what in Farrell's own gaze belongs to the system of meanings called "Irishness."

Study of Ideal Form, Sir Kenneth Clark picks up the tone of much of this criticism: Freshness of desire has seldom been more delicately expressed than by Miss O'Murphy's round young limbs, as they sprawl with undisguised satisfaction on the cushions of her sofa. By art Boucher has enabled us to enjoy her with as little shame as she is enjoying herself. One false note and we should be embarrassingly back in the world of sin.26 Similarly, Paul Frankl's famous meditation on the Odalisque begins, "Boucher's painting ... can be smilingly enjoyed as one enjoys a rose- bud which needs no interpretation,"27 and he is seconded by Bryson, who, though deep in the throes of deconstructing the myth of a seam- less and triumphant quattrocento space, pauses to point out that Boucher gives us what "the erotic gaze most desires . . . simply, posture."2" This consensus is striking because the viewpoint these critics 26.

From the upper right- hand corner of Madonna Irlanda, Farrell's self-portrait gazes on Miss O'Murphy with the face that occupies other paintings of himself; he tends to look as though he has stepped out of a painting by Hockney or Fischl-jaded, a little flabby, detumescent. Frankl's analysis of Boucher must be used for one other point; he hypothesizes that O'Murphy became the prototype for Boucher's many nudes whose mythic narrative situation insists that they be swimming. The possibly skewed relationship between her body and the couch (they could well exist on slightly separated planes) suggests that Boucher recognized this further use of her figure as he was painting her. Frankl concludes that in "the swimming pose Boucher picked out one of the unstatic movements which are completely in harmony with the essence of the rococo. . . . Stern morality is static and firmly grounded, the morality of the rococo swims."29 Farrell pictorially exploits this elegant point to insist on O'Murphy's motionlessness. Held in place by halo on the left and burning buttocks on the right, slowly turning from living flesh (Boucher was famous for his flesh tones, his rosy knees and buttocks) to statuary marble, she is cut free from the rococo world of pleasant motion and hooked into a profound stasis produced from ambivalence about the female body, about the body in general as eter- nal threat to the other half of the Cartesian scale. Stasis and Censorship The Irish of the last seven centuries have always been the victims of some kind of censorship, finally extricating themselves in the south from English rule only to impose there a complex and repressive inter- nal censorship code, one result of which is putatively the radical underdevelopment of visual art education in Ireland. To say that the Catholic church (in complicity with English Victorian mores) produced this aspect of Irishness, as most historical analysts of Irish censorship have, is to miss the main event: a reflexive and widespread resistance to seeing movement, to recognizing its necessity, and ultimately to sanc- tioning radical changes of posture. Similarly, one way to read the famous ambiguity and obliquity of English-as-it-is-spoken-in-Ireland involves noticing the protective coloration involved; the discourse 29.

As I see it, then, censorship in Ireland is not really a political or legislative issue at heart; it is a symptom of a specific kind of psychologi- cal development on individual and group levels. (This is one reason that a video like "The Dominatrix Sleeps Tonight" was, according to its producers, never censored in Ireland as it was in the U.S.-it is simply irrelevant to indigenous experience, with its huge American cars and Victoria's Secret underwear, its promise of upward mobility in a mark- edly lesbian world; a Dominatrix is different and threatens more subtly on this island.) For example, violate the introjected command to remain in place, and you risk the fate of Cuchulain, Ireland's Oedipus-in-reverse, who not only spends much of his brief heroic life doing battle because of the ultra-dominant Queen Medb but also murders his only son, goes mad, and spends himself battling the sea. The motility feared in Farrell's world connects with resistance to the suppressed arkhein that Joyce's ALP embodies as "the language of flow." Hence, the problems aired by Madonna Irlanda include not only the difficulty of keeping virgin-whore stereotypes strictly in place but also the grotesque social cost involved. From retrograde constitutional referenda banning abortion and divorce in the Republic (1983, 1987) to the dynamics of terrorist vision in the North, such terrible tensions are represented in the painting, as will become clear, through inner details and outer frame. Miss O'Murphy safely pinned down, the male body also has its place in Madonna Irlanda. The composition forces the outsider's eye into peripheral motions that sweep us, on the one side, to Leonardo's Vitruvian man, and on the other, to the artist's self-portrait. This balance between reference to the spatial paradigm of the Italian Renaissance and reference to a disembodied head insists that we remove the body from material existence and codify it in art historical terms. A theoretical question posed by this compositional strategy is how to sustain a relationship between the iconography of the Celtic head cult and the self-castration signing the projected universal "castration" of the woman as she modulates into a specifically Irish form of suppression. Head Cult The Celts took to heart the early European belief that the head is "the source of spiritual potency."'3 When Cuchulain undergoes heroic 30.

This ideology of the head suggests that one kind of energy expresses itself through the face, another through the body, a severing that Farrell transcribes through the benign irrelevance of Boucher's odalisque as she looks into nothing- ness. Her orientation is important; where the face looks matters, at least in the Celtic frame of reference, in which stone godheads were placed on hills to keep an eye on the terrain." So common are these field monuments that Irish children have been surprised "not to find them everywhere" in other countries.2 Part of the landscape, these heads are neither male nor female-although they assimilate to discussion under the rubric of "the gods." Neutered and possibly neutralized by their symbolic value, they are panoptical beings ironically less powerful than the landscape-as-deity they survey." The virgin land, much raped and pillaged by the likes of Neolithic tribes, Celts, Vikings, and Englishmen, lies immobile, passive, blindly inattentive to itself, projecting the other- wise powerful Dominatrix's privilege of vision (Ireland as a woman who fixes you with her gaze) onto neuter heads that disregard their ambi- ance. Miss O'Murphy's eye-power is syphoned off into the official elsewhere. Farrell's own head iterates the attitude customary in his self- portraits of sullen disregard; his face displays a reluctance to look at the 31. See ibid., p. 14. 32. Anne Crookshank, "Louis le Brocquy," in Louis le Brocquy and the Celtic Head Image, p. 22. Crookshank is a professor of art history at Trinity College, Dublin, and her comments bear quoting at length: To those of us with an Irish childhood, accustomed from our earliest days to picnics beneath high crosses, by ruined abbeys, or at ancient sites, the idea of the head image is an ingrained part of our visual memory. Like round towers and bogs, it comes as a surprise not to find them everywhere. These grey stone faces look solemnly down at us, the sole inhabitants now of isolated, grass covered places once the centre of religious ceremonies. Very difficult to date, some of them may have been carved during the late Middle Ages so that the ancient tradition has continued in a small way for a long time. [P. 22] 33. Louis le Brocquy is the contemporary Irish artist most clearly indebted to the Celtic head cult, although many artists experiment with images of masked and travestied visages. An interesting feature of le Brocquy's aesthetic obsession with the head is his emphasis on the masculine face, the masculine Look. His heads pointedly portray a number of well-known Irishmen-Wolfe Tone, Robert Emmet, Yeats, Joyce, Beckett- usually in multiple versions or impressions; for example, le Brocquy produced 120 takes on Joyce's head. He has also portrayed a cluster of non-Irish men-August Strindberg, Federico Garcia Lorca-and he has done some female studies-"Study of a Girl's Head," "Image of Anne," "Caroline." The 1981 exhibit of his work at the New York State Museum (the catalog for which is Louis le Brocquy and the Celtic Head Image) carefully plots this tendency to heroize, etherealize, and particularize the men of his country and to generalize the women. In fact, most portraits of women date from before his 1960s enthusiasm for the Celtic head cult. Le Brocquy instinctively accedes to the preference in Ireland for male viewers and the relative inattention to women's physicality-this against the grain of Western art's love affair with the female face and form.</page><page sequence="16">16 Cheryl Herr The Erotics of Irishness body before him. My students have commented on the oddity of his look-why does this man not strike us as a voyeur? Why is he not attracted to the body that titillated Casanova, Boucher, Louis XV, and Sir Kenneth Clark? Of course, though she looks vaguely continental, this is his mother, and his mother appears to him to be a whore. And so he fears her to the point of bodilessness in her presence? He becomes "adipose rex," as the Wake would have it (FW, p. 499)? She becomes the phallus embodied, albeit flaccidly, and lying on a sofa? Whatever the case, needing her to be his body-to access all of the somatic energy that the head cult suppresses in favor of eye-control-he hates her, the dominating ingenue who maps his world. He looks at her with the authoritarian intensity and puritanical commitment of a Provo guer- rilla,34 provisional especially in his willingness to gaze at the mother repressed into passivity and codified into self-destroying contradiction. But Miss O'Murphy does not appear to care. She looks off into a middle distance that he cannot occupy. Her line of vision potentially spies only the Vitruvian man on a trompe l'oeil curtain. Poor Visibility, Celtic Twilight Leonardo's man in a circle (fig. 5) illustrates Vitruvius's "code of human proportions,""5 the ideal body of a certain historical moment. Vitruvius felt that designs of buildings and other artifacts should draw their proportionality from the relationships among body units, chin to crown of head, navel to extended arm, and so on. Oddly disproportion- ate, Leonardo's version of this concept looks severe if not disgusted by the whole project, "devoid of volume." Only ten years later, Leonardo would himself outmode this sense of the human figure.36 Of course, he epitomized the intellectual and visual force of his historical period much as Boucher did for the late eighteenth century. He worked with linear perspective and with how the eye operates; he respected the sense of sight above all others,37 but at the time that he drew the Vitruvian man, Leonardo had not yet arrived at these studies or performed the anatomical work for which he became famous. The space he represented in 1485 was much flatter, a system of planes that isolated figures and pinned them, each to separate walls, like moths who had died blind and vaguely disgruntled. It is to this space and look, but without postmodern motivation, that Farrell recurs in his own 34. See Ken Heskin, "The Psychology of Terrorism in Northern Ireland," in Terrorism in Ireland, ed.

What we notice, even in a reproduction of Madonna Irlanda, is that the Vitruvian model has been fractured by the curtain- actually, by being part of the curtain that is a faux frame. The introduction of a trompe l'oeil effect works much as Jean Baudrillard claims in his essay on this device. Understandably, he finds this style of painting simulacral, "highly ritualised," flat. "Trompe- l'oeil," he claims, "forgets all the grand themes and distorts them by</page><page sequence="18">18 Cheryl Herr The Erotics of Irishness means of the minor figuration of some object or other." The emphasis in Baudrillard falls heavily on forgetting, loss of memory, denial of history, the hauntedness that trompe l'oeil objects convey. In their opposition to "the whole representative space elaborated by the Renais- sance," these objects "preserve the ... fantastic pregnancy-that of the discovery of the mirror image by the child. Something, that is, like an immediate hallucination of its own body as preexisting the perceptual order." In reference to the individual and collective suppression of the erotic-maternal body that we are triangulating through Farrell's self- portraiture, the investment of trompe l'oeil in forgetting speaks volumes.38 The semantics of loss that Farrell charts installs in the foreground of individual and cultural identity a particular developmental moment. What is Madonna Irlanda if not, at some level, a metaphorically "mirror- staged" painting that uses lines of vision (including the painting's many eyes, even the amorphous "frog" eye-a Frenchified viewpoint from the Irish perspective of hard moral outlines?-placed toward the lower frame) not to install the universal space of linear perspective but rather to point out the parallel fields indicated by viewpoints that cannot cohere, the spaces flattened not by Sobchackian movement from the photographic to the cinematic-electronic but by the steady plod of a culture dedicated to miconnaissance and skilled in generating its visual style out of suppressions? The space in question is lighted, for Baudril- lard, by a glow that he finds "mysterious," sourceless, surrealist. The Irish have been known to call it the Celtic twilight. The very shadow- lessness Baudrillard speaks of reveals the fear of movement that Farrell's depicted view confirms and then frames with dimensionless drapery-as though (and this seems pure projection) if he were not to keep an eye on her and box her in, Miss O'Murphy would lose the halo and engulf him. That she is shown as limply benign speaks to this point; she is underplayed in a denial of fear and power. The entire composi- tion accedes to her loss of energy. On that curtain is yet another sign of the emptying of meaning that is elsewhere anxiously constructed; against the head cult's values we find posed the Vitruvian man's caricature head, which looks very like the ape-Irish stereotypes used by the English from the thirteenth century to the present (fig. 6). Instead of defining the circle of his exist- ence, Farrell's Paddy lowers his arms to cover his genitals, more interested in protecting himself than in claiming his corporeal integrity as the measure of all things.39 This is the boy who would "enjoy 38.

More than just a threatening female body forcing him into predictable castra- tion anxiety, Miss O'Murphy is the dominatrix who compels even without knowing it. She is the figure, ground, and trompe l'oeil frame; an unthinkable presymbolic undoing of the Name of the Father trans- posed into a realm of pure silence; a cliche; a saint who is absent in her own violation; a body that conforms to so overdetermined an icono- graphic program that transparency and presence are not available even as myths; the Irish arkhein; the mirror moment when linguistic prehis- tory torques into the obliquities of Irish discourse. Her attributes are not coincident, of course; they cannot integrate but instead flip through their contradictory modes before the rewinding that in Irish circles looks like the latest Celtic "renaissance." By mentioning the prehistoric and the pre-Oedipal, I am not gesturing toward a Jungian racial unconscious but rather toward a quasi-Lacanian formulation, the collective mind in its most bodily condensation, which turns out to be structured like a prehistoric language banned from official registers of Irish self-representation but still capable of emitting signals into the symbolic. In the negative space mapped by this painting lies a potential for certain kinds of movement, connection, process that have yet to be produced in an Ireland seemingly poised these many years at the brink of paradigmatic change. Given that, as I show below, institutional perspectives underplay the possibility of a matriarchal society predating patriarchy and symmetrically resist legitimating varieties of female power, it is worth asking how individual modern Irish women figure in this analysis. To what extent is their experience swept up in Farrell's arch aesthetic interrogation of Irish social traditions? Herotica "People may fuck a lot but they still don't even bare their bodies" (Marianne, age 20, Ireland, 1979).

"The nuns told us girls were always to blame for arousing men" (Rosemary, age 21, Ireland, 1979).

The one Irish student in the class, Ray Ryan, immediately quipped that masturbation and self- protection are "the same thing." 40.

"When you talk of Ireland, you talk of a uniquely damaged culture" (Ivor Browne, department of psychiatry, University College, Dublin, 1979). "You can be naked in Ireland; you just can't be doing anything" (Pat Murphy, Irish filmmaker, 1988). "We used to get lectures (I haven't written about this because it is not really believable) that since we had a steady salary we would be an enormous source of sexual excitement; that girls might be prepared to do certain things because of our position and that it was our duty to restrain these women" (John McGahern, Irish novelist, 1987).41 One convenient text for approaching popular images of the body is Nancy Scheper-Hughes's Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics. This ethno- graphic study, like others done in Ireland, has been controversial, especially among the Irish. In her second edition of the book, Scheper- Hughes herself documents the degree of outrage expressed by the people she had lived among after they had read her book. Several years later, Scheper-Hughes returns to this topic and draws some different lines to describe her current anthropological practice, the reduced degree to which she probes secrets and exposes her informants to discomfort.42 Although the book received reasonably good reviews in social science journals when it appeared,43 the passage of years has cast into relief a number of methodological issues. In particular, a reader has to question the value of evidence gained when an anthropologist administers psychological diagnostic tests that are themselves of de- batable reliability. There is a good deal of the self-fulfilling prophe- cy about Scheper-Hughes's inquiry, and yet Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics usefully documents prominent aspects of Irish self-representation.

Beginning from the often-adduced point that the Republic has "the highest hospitalization treatment rate for mental illness in the world" and that "schizophrenia is the core problem" (S, p. 3), Scheper-Hughes explores the genetic, biochemical, and environmental explanations for this situation. She did her fieldwork in a small community in Kerry, reconstructing the ethnohistory of the area and talking with both "normal" and hospitalized residents. Ambivalence, ambiguity, irony, evasion, conflict-all of these traits and more are given deep resonance in this study. She tries to define Irish identity according to a model that explains its etiology, persistence, and chained cause-effects. Scheper-Hughes focuses on celibacy norms, asceticism, resistance to being touched, and sexual repression as well as less obvious phenom- ena such as the then putatively widely dispersed ignorance of orgasms among Irish countrywomen or the taboo on breast-feeding (considered by some a violation of body boundaries).44 She gathers impressive evidence that in rural areas the Irish body is or was construed as worth- less, endangering, and constantly threatened. The typical reader of this situation would attribute such body coding to the impact of the Catho- lic church on the "peasant mind," but Scheper-Hughes's evidence takes us much further. Consider that she presented normal adolescents and those diag- nosed as mentally ill with Thematic Apperception Test cards. One such card pictures a woman lying face up in bed with a sheet over her lower body but with her breasts exposed; standing up and facing away from her is a fully dressed man, who covers his eyes with his upraised arm (fig. 7). According to Scheper-Hughes, responses to this card displayed the alacrity with which normal young people censored from their inter- pretations "sexual love or intimacy themes." In place of "romance or marriage stories," these'adolescents tried collectively to "defuse or desexualize situations in which the sexes are in proximate contact" (S, p. 125). Half of the normal respondents read the card as a death scene. On the other hand, the diagnosed schizophrenics (and Scheper-Hughes claims to have compared these Irish diagnoses with nonnative doctors' readings to insure a measure of "objectivity") did not deflect the sexual content of the scene, insisting on the place of romance and erotic physi- cality in their interpretations. Reading Scheper-Hughes's study of rural Ireland in tandem with a work like Rosita Sweetman's On Our Backs, a series of interviews with Dubliners, is troubling. (The two books share a 1979 copyright.)

She shows us what she calls a "hidden aspect" of Ireland,45 which finds best expression in the votes for contin- ued constitutional bans on abortion and civil divorce. Populating this invisible Eire, whose children are now reaching middle age, are the abused orphan, the prostitute, the "Irish macho," the irresponsible and alcoholic father still dominated by his doting mother, the ignored wife who repeats history by adoring her son while refusing to tell him the facts of life, the priests who counsel their male charges against the evils of women wearing backless dresses, the convent girls so terrorized by the nuns' violent response to their becoming women that they cease menstruation. Again and again, Sweetman suggests that not just marital dissatisfaction but also the turmoil of Irish history is illogically laid, by 45.

The tension that this attribu- tion both masks and reveals has to do with myths of matriarchal dominance in Ireland. Although it is demonstrable that the Irish mother has a good deal of influence within many homes, especially in the minds of her sons, and although Ireland itself is generally thought of as a woman who demands and gets considerable sacrifice,46 the actual power exercised by Irish women is severely constrained to a certain familial and ideological zone that does not disarm the more powerful patriarchal syntax of the culture. That the diffuse agents of patriarchy resist reverse domination and stylize socially produced ideologies of the body to compensate for perceived danger is precisely to the point of the symmetries that this essay charts. The Arkhein Is dads the thing in such or are tits the that? -JAMES JOYCE, Finnegans Wake The varied, traditional, and ongoing repression of the represented body that Joyce, Scheper-Hughes, Sweetman, and others document goes hand in hand with the socially systematic constructions of Irish identity, and this complex system is folded into Farrell's self-portrait. That Farrell (however archly) defines his own pictorial subjectivity in these terms is disturbing. Equally unsettling is the fact that institutional archaeology in Ireland, apparently governed by symmetrical styliza- tions, reads out of the official story a great deal of female-identified content that could be useful to Irish feminists and others interested in claiming alternative somatic and social texts. The Irish archaeological enterprises that are probably best known worldwide today involve the excavation of Neolithic structures, includ- ing what have been called passage tombs, court tombs, cairns, mounds, and tumuli. Many of these structures have been categorized according to internal design, but most of them appear similar from the outside; they are large circular mounds of earth and stone often found on hill- tops overlooking attractive vistas. Lest my connection of the rhetoric of Irish art with the rhetoric of Irish archaeology seem tenuous, I should add that these structures are the earliest ones remaining in Ireland, dating from four thousand or more years ago, and have been consid- 46. The 1988 video entitled "Mother Ireland," directed by Anne Crilly and produced by Derry Film and Video with support from Britain's Channel Four, explores and explodes many myths surrounding the figure of Ireland as woman. In Irish studies circles, this video has been enormously influential in bringing to the fore women's voices and attitudes about the terms in which they are persistently stereotyped. The Mother Ireland myth does show remarkable resilience, even in the face of ongoing critique.</page><page sequence="25">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1990 25 ered a nominal point of origin for an indigenous identity, the prehistoric architecture of Irishness. The country, north and south, hosts about 1,400 megalithic mounds as well as other circular struc- tures (the count varies, depending on one's source and assumptions about whether to incorporate a projection for now-destroyed monu- ments), including some of the largest and most spectacular tombs in Europe. They are high-profile aspects of the Irish setting. Farrell's early art, which self-consciously grounds itself in Irish motifs, exploits the designs characteristic of these ancient structures. More to the point, the Neolithic passage graves frequently symbolize Ireland in the media; as Luke Gibbons has pointed out, the best known of these mounds have been portrayed "not only in IDA [Industrial Development Authority] brochures but also in the Bank of Ireland's publicity material."47 Gibbons suggests the ironies of such commercial appropriation of these structures to further a made-up prehistory that suits the purposes of the corporate world, but the fact remains that the Neolithic passage graves are among the best-known identifiers in Ireland for Ireland. Three major mounds cluster in the Boyne valley, about twenty-five miles from Dublin. Newgrange (fig. 8), a popular tourist site, has been described in print since the seventeenth century. Knowth, under exca- vation for the past twenty years, has much to tell us about Neolithic society, information embodied in George Eogan's elegant and authori- tative book Knowth and the Passage-Tombs of Ireland. Having been to Newgrange, Knowth, and various cairns throughout Ireland, I find Eogan's report an excellent field in which to explore the disciplinary decorum of archaeology in relation to larger cultural patterns in Ireland. Eogan describes Neolithic society in the Boyne valley as focused on a cult of the dead and as divided into a hierarchy of workers. Evidence for social stratification comes from the mounds themselves; to build Knowth required construction skills that it is rather difficult to project back into that dim period occupied in Finnegans Wake by the character Mutt, whose (m)other lingo the invader Jute attributes to a speech impediment. For the most part, Eogan's book sustains a rigorously nonspeculative mode. As a careful scientist, he presents the facts, particularly the measurements relevant to his project of excavation and preservation. This scientific perspective stands at odds with a great deal of depiction that I would call "mound art" and that includes painters' and sculptors' uses of passage-grave decorative motifs, poems that refer to the mounds, stories set near prehistoric spots, folklore about these sites, straightforwardly antiestablishment theories about Irish prehis- tory (such as those sometimes put forward by antiquarians and 47.

Some of these aesthetic responses to the mounds point in the direction of local assessments: as far as I have been able to determine from recorded ethnographic anecdote, people living near the tumuli have consistently overlaid onto the cairns their own meanings, assigning to them a powerful charge and imagining them as having been the dwellings of female-identified supernatural beings such as the Tuatha De Danaan. Given the option to walk over a mound or around it, locals often walk around. Today, many scholars and all archaeologically oriented femi- nists that I am aware of claim the cairns and their decorations as evidence for widespread European worship of a primary goddess (either in the Neolithic period or in later uses of these sacred sites) and for a corresponding social register of matriarchal power.48 Following the specific mores of his discipline, Eogan is thorough and impeccable in describing the site, and he does not linger on the folklore that has accumulated around the mounds, the art inspired by them, or the more speculative side of the archaeological project. He describes the designs found in these mounds as nonrepresentational and geometric, without recoverable meaning. Within this context, the way in which Eogan describes his initial entry into Knowth is of remark- able interest. First, he tells the story of his discovery of the apparent "guardian" of the inner chamber, an orthostat depicting "what seemed to be an anthropomorphic figure with two large, staring eyes" (fig. 9).49 His narrative continues: At a point which would prove to be about a third of the way in, we came upon a well-preserved stretch and felt growing excitement. 48.

This solar mating has survived 5000 years of successive cultures" (Dorothy Walker, review of Overlay: Contemporary Art and the Art ofPrehistory, by Lippard, Irish Literary Supplement 3 [Fall 1984]: 44-45). 49.

About 2.5 m below lay a large chamber, whose great corbelled roof rose around me [fig. 10], spanned by a single capstone up to 4 m above. My 'passage' over the orthostats was roofed by vast lintels, some of which were decorated. After a while I dropped down into the chamber, noticing its cruciform plan with a number of decorated orthostats. The right-hand recess in this plan was 'guarded' by two large jambstones. Looking between them, I saw a uniquely orna- mented stone basin, with horizontal and vertical scorings on the outside and, just opposite the recess opening, a composition of concentric circles with flankers at the bottom.... What a structure and what a surpriser ... And, having wriggled through some diffi- cult parts in the passage on my way in, my presence alone in the tomb-despite its massiveness-gave me a sense not of isolation, but of security.50 Despite the claims made on his consciousness and procedures by the scientific enterprise of institutional archaeology, Eogan generously chronicles his entry in a kind of counternarrative to the rest of his writ- ing. The securely enwombed archaeologist, caught up in his wonderful experience of a tumulus "revirgined" by a centuries-long removal from curious eyes, spontaneously appreciates the sight. I would say that Eogan's writing projects his experience of an energy excess (communi- cated by Neolithic design), of the primeval arkhein that, built around a uterine space and also panoptically surveying the surrounding land- scape, framed the society's experience and organized its identity in terms of somatic power. The architecture reconveyed to him some of its structural meaning before disciplinary codes of operation intervened to deflect that information in the more formal portion of his report.5' Eogan's portrayal of his personal experience aligns him with many 50. Ibid., pp. 34-35. 51. Lippard cites numerous examples worldwide of male archaeologists effacing evidence of female-identified cultures and quotes Aubrey Burl's dissatisfaction with the concept of a goddess cult in Ireland (Lippard, Overlay, p. 65). Whether or not a goddess cult existed seems less interesting than the rhetoric of contemporary Irish archaeology and the responses of scholars outside the archaeological profession to that rhetorical posi- tion. A case in point is the artist Martin Brennan, whose discussion of Knowth bears repeating: Knowth is strictly in the domain of archaeologists. It is completely sealed off from the enquiring eyes of independent researchers by a high fence topped with barbed wire. Inside, the mound is in the process of being cut apart like a layer cake, while its magnificent art treasures lie covered up under sheets of black plastic. Perhaps the comparative obscurity of megalithic art today is due to the fact that at Knowth</page><page sequence="30">:f ?~ ~;~.'?'?

It could be argued that the institutionally necessary rhetorical shift in Eogan's report from personal experience to archaeological specificities repeats a gesture of neutralization that we have seen before and that we can profitably examine in the pursuit of a crossdisciplinary understanding of Irish culture. My point here is not that the Irish should reach back to the Neolithic past for a sense of identity-an impossible gesture to carry through and a sentimental journey as fraught with difficulties as a social praxis based on Deleuzian schizoanalysis. Rather, I think that the authorized interpretation of visual materials from that overwhelmingly female-identified past (or at least a past whose remains generations have read in "somatomorphic" terms) has tended to ensure a flattened appropriation of them, a reluctance to connect issues of shape and structure with cultural dialogue and possibility, and an unwillingness to recover at any level the physicality of the body in other than the most destructive and threatening sense. There is a prevailing institutional taboo against imagining what Irish prehistory was like, against allowing competing visions to converse. Disciplinary boundaries overrule consid- eration of the many ways the body can be represented and set in motion; these blockages chart a meaning-charged relationship. So it is that in my reading of Irish self-representation, the undoing by his disci- pline of an archaeologist's personal sensory responses metaphorically doubles the treatment of Miss O'Murphy, for whom an experience of her own violation is not available. The redounding of her anaesthetici- zation, art historical and otherwise, in Farrell's pictorial disembodiment speaks to more than just the castration fears that Farrell sees in his world; we enter here a realm of internal censorship that traverses genders and ricochets into a shared obsession with defining the collec- tive mind. Literally and broadly out of touch with its bodies, that mind produces an aesthetics of denial that is uncomfortable appropriating multidimensionally the design of its environment. Again, we're talking about 1,400 megalithic mounds plus other related field monuments that Irish people have gone to for childhood picnics as Pennsylvanians would go to Valley Forge or Gettysburg (Ireland is about the size of Pennsylvania). some of its greatest examples remain quite literally cloaked in secrecy. [Brennan, The Stars and the Stones: Ancient Art and Astronomy in Ireland (London, 1983), p. 56] Brennan favors a representational status for Neolithic art. It is worth noting that in 1980 he and Jack Roberts confirmed previous reports that various cairns in Ireland constitute a massive and precise system for charting astronomical movements. According to Brennan, this discovery was ignored by the Irish archaeological establishment even though the Irish press headlined the story. The layman in these issues is likely to be intrigued by Brennan's book, which is exciting and elegant.</page><page sequence="32">32 Cheryl Herr The Erotics of lrishness Side by side with this denial is the work of a filmmaker like Pat Murphy, who specifically attempts to access a feminist perspective in her analyses of Irish life and who finds these monuments a potential source of enrichment that Irish men and women have been taught to discount.52 Consider the untutored comment of a local woman who, when asked by Scheper-Hughes what some fieldstones meant, replied, "'Those were the kinds of altars we used to have before the priests made them flat'" (S, p. 23). (This flattening is not the sort that Sobchack analyzes; her videologic would be relatively invisible or nonsignifying in this field.) At the level of collectivity, the cairns might operate as mediators to a register of meaning that accommodates a concept of other symbolic orders, an alternativity, a visual semiotic that could foster new ways of looking and moving. Terrible Beauty Take the mounds as a Rorschach test. Consider that looking closely at Newgrange and at Miss O'Murphy continues to produce not sensuous significance but a loss of vitality that instantiates a primal anti- erotic gaze. When a certain kind of institutional Irish eye looks at women, it sees a rather daunting witch, a voracious female. How did that arkhein which promotes an archaeologist's feelings of security become the represented-as-grimly-dominant Irish mothers of the past two centuries? A shorthand answer suggests itself in Patrick J. Keane's study of Yeats and Joyce. His work is grounded in the varied identifica- tions of Ireland with a woman (Kathleen Ni Houlihan, the Poor Old Woman) who compels young men to die for her. Keane feels honorably and passionately that violence is not the answer to Ireland's political and economic problems, but in place of an analysis of this lived history and of the relationship of art to it, he loosely connects some references to Bloody Sunday and English shoot-to-kill policies to the many allu- sions in Irish writing to an evil hag. Thus he suggests that a commitment to the vicious service of the mythical Mother Ireland is the cause of ongoing bloodshed. I see these relationships differently. The argument that the myth of Ireland as a woman motivates the endless sacrifice of her sons and lovers runs counter to the actual situation, in which a prevailing refusal of official sanction for Ireland's female-identified prehistory feeds the unbalanced negativity that many writers have indeed exploited. Repre- sentative of a whole school of thought about Ireland, Keane's book demonstrates the hazards that attend a failure to approach Irish icons 52. Conversation with Pat Murphy, Dublin, 21 Aug. 1989.</page><page sequence="33">Critical Inquiry Autumn 1990 33 through an analysis of the complex systems of Irish "identity" and psychohistory.5s The type of work that deplores violence in moralistic terms alone cannot explain why it is that the oppressions of invading forces have been stylized through the centuries and introjected as the Dominatrix-Mound-Mother's putative pleasure in the death of her sons. Nor can it explain why that supposed voracity has led to a certain neutralizing of sexuality, let alone of ecriture feminine, in Ireland. Or why an admittedly skewed gene pool has produced not just high levels of schizophrenia but schizophrenia that speaks in the voice of the body- censor. Or finally, why voyeurism appears to find its most powerful native expression not in Peeping Tomism or in art history but in the covert optics of guerrilla warfare. Surely a different reading of Irish bodies and Irish social patterns must be generated if we are to understand the continued power of traditional images, myths, and gestures. This alternative reading would attend to the degree to which the represented body has become an anti- fetish in Ireland, a turnoff, the presumed source of whatever it is that makesJoycean paralysis the safe choice; so it is that the learned eye stills the body at which it gazes while simultaneously screening out both movement and messages that would dislodge this visual-hermeneutic circuit. While the need for a certain stillness remains projected onto the body, preferably the body of a woman or a landscape figured as female, the authorized centers of meaning in the society discover again and again that their own ability to move has been impeded. That the power of an alternativity or matri-symbolic (again, projected here in the most nonliteral terms imaginable) still has cultural force is expressed in many aspects of Irish life, including Farrell's choice of the Madonna Irlanda figure for his series of political paint- ings. Having in earlier days worked through the available international modes and spiraled back to the interesting shapes of Neolithic and Celtic art, he became sufficiently aware of some threatening or disturb- ing element-what I locate in the trope of a repressed prehistory-to retreat ironically into the sanctioned, universal visual language of Western art history. Looking for an Irish body, he thus went with conscious irony to Boucher and Leonardo. Like Joyce ransacking the Western world not for "universality" but for moral support in approaching a crucially identifying unknown that has taken shape in Ireland as a feared Dominatrix, Farrell appropriated the double-speak, puns, wit, bitter irony, allegorical iconography, and the other displac- ing figures often seen as typical of Irish discourse. This fallback position we "recognize" as Irish; it is the form of choice for expressing 53. See Patrick J. Keane, Terrible Beauty: Yeats, Joyce, Ireland, and the Myth of the Devouring Female (Columbia, Mo., 1988).</page><page sequence="34">34 Cheryl Herr The Erotics of lrishness anxiety over the inability to block awareness of the arkhein sedimented into certain visual registers. As Ellie Ragland-Sullivan notes, quoting Jacques Lacan, "'In our relationship to things, as constituted by the path of vision and ordered in the figures of representation, something glides, passes, transmits itself from stage to stage, in order always to be in some degree eluded there.'""4 One sense that this comment could take on in the current discussion is to describe the self-replicating twist at the heart of Irish self-representation. Around the neutralized body, a complex system of social identification resists postmodernism and all that we associate with it even while allowing the texts of an American present to enter its ports. There are thus profound disjunctions in Ireland today between traditions of collective identity and the kinds of information, ancient and videological, that are available. How the culture proceeds to negotiate its constitution of an Irish mind in the midst of these material changes may well tutor us all in the possibilities and means of social transformation. 54.
