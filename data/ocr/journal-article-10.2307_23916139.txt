<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY: ACTION AT A DISTANCE IN 20TH CENTURY PHYSICS* José M. SANCHEZ-RON ABSTRACT In this paper I review the different opinions held by scientists and philosophers as regards the status of the action-at-a-distance concept u/ithin relativistic physics. It is shown that in spite of the fact that the prevailing opinion has been that special relativity precludes actions at a distance, some important physicists have continued employing that concept throughout the present century. The key to understand that "anomalous" behaviour lies, in fact, in the relationships existent between quan tum and classical physics ("inverse" principle of correspondence). INTRODUCTION The publication, in 1687, of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica marked in many senses the opening of a new area in the development of physical sciences. So it happened, for instan ce, with the problem of how different bodies affect (that is, interact with) each other. Until the publication of the Principia, and with the possible exception of Aristotle's natural motions, which can be assimila ted in some sense to actions at a distance, aethereal mediums had no rivals as far as the explanation of the nature of interaction is concer ned. The most influential theory, or, better, conceptualization of nature, (not only before but also after 1687) was René Descartes' vortex system put forward in his Principia Philosophia, first published in 1644. Descar tes disliked all theories that depended on unspecified mechanisms, or actions at a distance, for the spatial transmission of forces or actions. He considered that actions at a distance would culminate by endowing material particles with knowledge, to the point of making them "turfy cLL * Lecture delivered at the Boston Colloquium for the Philosophy of Science, Boston, November 13, 1984.

As I said before, Newton's Principia meant the real introduc tion of the action-at-a-distance concept in physics. To appreciate this fact we have to remember that book II of the Principia, where the sys tem of the world is put forward, is based on the inverse square law, a law of standard action-at-a-distance structure, since it depends only on the positions of the interacting bodies (that is, no intervening medium appears). In this sense, it may be thought that the action-at-a-distance component of Newton's system is constrained to his theory of gravita tion. As it turns out this is not the case; Newton's assumption that when bodies at a distance (that is, not in direct contact) are moving relative to one another the third law still holds, implies in principle (i.e. if not other specification is made) that the interaction between them takes place instantaneously, for if the transmission takes time, then the action of, let us say, A on B may not be simultaneous with that of B on A and therefore in general not equal to it at all times. But the only instantaneous interaction wich makes sense is instantaneous action-at-a-distance. However, the introduction of actions at a distance through the Principia was far from being accepted or even really believed. It is well known -remember his 1693 letter to Richard Bentley- that even Newton thought that actions at a distance were "¿o gsizat an atUundity thai I HeJtie-ve. no man who ha* in philosophical maiJjMA a competent ¿acuity of. thinking, can eueA. faii. -into -it". (It is perhaps a mark of New ton's greatness as a physicist that, nevertheless, he did allow such con cept in his work). Neither Huygens, Leibniz or some of the Bernoullis could accept a physics in wich the action-at-a-distance concept played some role. As a matter of fact it was only by the 1750s -that is, more than sixty years after the publication of the Principia- when Newton's mechanics and theory of gravitation were virtually universally accepted in the Continent as accurate. Thus, the development of physics throughout the eighteenth and first half of the nineteenth centuries tended to impro ve the status of the action-at-a-distance concept with respect to its 440</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY rivals, the action through a continuous medium and the action by impact concepts. It might suffice, in this sense, to remember the names of Laplace, Coulomb, Ampére or Weber. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that "thai, staong instinctive fie.eJíing wkich denies action at a distance."1 was never completely lost, not even during the years in wich the action-at-a-distance model was hegemonic (so, for instance, Ampére at times speculated, as Newton did, as to the "cause" of ac tion-at-a-distance forces, conjecturing that the forces between currents might be transmitted by an aethereal fluid). On the light of such feelings it was only too natural that the advent of Maxwell's field electrodynamics, together with Hertz's 1888 experiments, were to mean the death knell of action-at-a-distance physics. An interesting example in this sense is provided by Arthur Schus ter who, after defending on epistemological grounds the action-at-a-dis tance concept, went on to state (in 1911): "Lfi I am anxious that you should siea&amp;Lie how weak. one. the. giounds on which we deny on principle, action at a distance* it is onhj to £ay the gnjeaieA. sbiess on the /iea¿ advance which science ha¿ m ade in consequence o/ the i.elie.f. that aM. action between two bodies is transmitted through a connecting medium,..

The prestige obtained by Maxwell's electrodynamics was such that finally a new world-view arose: The Electromagnetic View of Natu re. Let us remember that, in some of its presentations, that view clai med that all_ laws of nature -hence Newton's laws also- are reducible to properties of the ether-field. That is, one of the implicit aims of this world-view was to replace all_ actions at a distance for fields. The soon-to-follow "special relativity revolution" did not chan ge, as seen by most contemporaries, the situation. For my purposes here a most important fact is that ever 441</page><page sequence="4">José M. SANCHEZ-RON since special relativity was formulated it has aroused the (still!) extended belief that only field theories can cope with the modifications brought by Einstein's theory. A few examples in this sense are, no doubt, conve nient. In 1974, W. Berkson3 wrote: "(In hi.4 paper "On the tleduiodynamicA of flouing Bodies") Uji^Leln. ie.gan /ieAeaA.ch which eventually fiuxuJxeA off both Newtonian, and actton-at-a-cLiitance."', on a similar vein Infeld and Plebanski1* stated: "According to Relativity 7heoiy, no action can (Le propagated with a velocity g/ieaten. than c -the velocity of Light. 7hcu&gt; the. fieAl píopagating fnom one. point to another twigeiy because of.

Even more categoric was recently Garret Birkhoff5: "Since (special) neJkdlvity desiieA the poMJUiity of action at a distance', Newton'a I hi/id Law... can only be interpreted in term a of a 'field' theory ". Of course, , in the precedent quotations there are different questions involved, but not all of them will be considered here (actually, most of such questions have been repeatedly discussed over a number of years by Peter Havas). There is, however, one argument which has been, in one way or another, specially important in order to support the belief that special "relativity denies the possibility of action-at-a-dis tance". It is based on the fact that Maxwell's field electrodynamics did not need any modification in order to be incorporated into the frame work of special relativity. John Synge6 expressed it concisely in the following words: "Aa far. OA electro magnetic m wai concerned, the controversy of ' action-at-a-di/&gt;tance vzaaua action-tn.ou.gh-a-medium' waó Aettíed in an extraordinary and unexpected way. £Jn/&gt;Lein'¿ re£2¿¿ uiiy might He. Mud to favour action-th/iough-a-medium, ¿ince it accepted flaxwel^A partial diffenenttnJL equations". 442</page><page sequence="5">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY Just another expression of this kind of argumentation is to emphasize that the second postulate in the standard (but by no means unique; remember von Ignatowsky) presentation of special relativity is closely attached to Maxwells' field theory. Max Abraham7 stated it clear ly when, in 1914, wrote: "flany aappontenA o-f. the 7/ieoty of Relathüty desiive fiiom ihe fin/t postulate the unneceMlty of ihe conceptúo of a Apace- filling medium, an "ethe^.".

The nodical. the enemies o-f. ihe etheA, would. like, to disavow that o/iigin". (The only thing to add to this illuminating passage is that Abraham's fears seem a little out of place if one considers how strong has been the commitment to the field concept by most physicists after 1905). As a matter of fact, these scientists rightly pointed out the outstanding role played by Maxwell's ether-field electrodynamics in the initial • development of special relativity, but at the same time they denied to the latter theory the possibility of transcending the scien tific atmosphere in wich it was born (context of discovery), not seeing (in the context of justification) the fact that Einstein's theory is not a dynamical theory but a kinematical formulation, and that consequently it said nothing either about the structure of matter or about the existen ce of a medium for the propagation of interactions. Of course, not all the community of physicists viewed spe cial relativity as a kind of subdiscipline of electrodynamics. Einstein and Planck, for instance, were fairly clear on its status (indeed, the fact that his relativistic kinematics did not depend on the knowledge of Maxwell's equations was specially important for Einstein, as he him self acknowledged later in his life, because his studies on the black-body radiation problem had convinced him that Maxwell's theory was only approximately true). Others, like Sommerfeld, thought that the Lorentz Einstein viewpoint fell within the limits of the mechanicistic tradition. It is, therefore, true that there was in fact a wide variety 443</page><page sequence="6">José M. SANCHEZ-RON of reactions towards special relativity. On the whole, however, and con sidering not only the inmediate reaction but a more extended one, I think that the arguments against the action-at-a-distance concept did prevail. (Of course, one should never forget, among other thongs, that the force of such arguments was enhanced and even mixed up with the successes and heuristic appeal of general relativity, a field theory). We already saw the opinions which some historians of science (Berkson), physicists (Infeld and Plebanski) and mathematicians (Birkhoff) have put forward, but there is still another, and most important, evidence: Albert Einstein himself. Everybody knows that, specially after 1909, Einstein turned with a growing enthusiasm towards the "field approach". So, in 1949 he wrote8; "TieM theoiy doeA exist ai a pnognum: 'Continuous, functionA ■in the. faun-dimenAional (continuum) oa (Loaíc concepts of the theo/iy'. Rigid adherence to this, p/uognum can nightfuMy He aA6e/b ted to me". There are many examples of instance in which, over a long period of time, Einstein attacked actions at a distance. Let me present just one9: "I adm.it, ho lú even, a¿ penfectiy posúMe that penhaps physicA cannot He HaAed upon the fieM notion, that -U&gt;, upon continuous einmentA. But then nothing wou&amp;L He. fe.ft of aM my constnuctionA -taking alóo into account the theoay of. gravitation- a¿ ioe£¿ oa of. pneAent phy^icA, aim o it nothing". Did Einstein mean here that special relativity -one of his constructions- is only compatible with the field notion?' Although, appa rently he did, I do not think (because of other evidences) that he really thought so. But the point is that through his numerous writings he did not help by any means the belief that actions at a distance might still have, from a logical point of view, a place in relativistic physics. ACTIONS AT A DISTANCE IN ELECTRODYNAMICS: SCHWARZSCHILD, TETRODE AND THE "QUANTUM CONNECTION" In spite of what have been said before concerning the view points held by most scientists, it turns out that fields are not singled</page><page sequence="7">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY out as the only possibility for describing (relativistic) electromagnetic phenomena. Physics research in our century has taught us that, in some respects, that the nature of physical interactions could differ from our anthropomorphic expectations. We shall see that what I call the "inverse principle of correspondence" (meaning that problems within quantum mechanism suggest developments in classical theories) was behind the fact that in some sense the action-at-a-distance concept "is useful after all". A first step in the direction of proving the usefulness of the action-at-a-distance concept in electrodynamics appears in the works of Karl Schwarzschild in 1903 when he was at Gottingen, the Dutchman Hugo M. Tetrode in 1922, and that of his fellow countryman Adriaan D. Fokker in 1929, where they proved that Maxwell's equations (and 1 am saying equations, not theory) could also be derived from an ac tion-at-a-distance standpoint (they, used a variational principle where only particles appear). But let us have a closer look at these develop ments. Schwarzschild's work of 190310 was carried out as part of his research on the variational formulation of the theory of electrons. He found a variational principle where no fields appear -due, essentially, to the reduction of partial differential equations to integral equations-, but he did not paid special attention to such fact. That is, the action at-a-distance concept came to electrodynamics through the back door, to say so. However it probably could hardly have been otherwise in the Goettingen of Minkowski, Abraham and Wiechert where the Electro magnetic View of Nature has solids roots. Consequently, the relevance that Schwarzschild's work has had in the action-at-a-distance -field con troversy has made itself specially evident many years after 1903, with the benefit of hindsight. It was in the twenties when some physicists began to worry about the field concept. Their motivation laid essentially in the quantum domain, and this is a fact that must be stressed as one of the lessons which will turn out from the present considerations. Maxwell's theory became, in the hands of H.A. Lorentz, the electron theory and this together with the work of spectroscopists, atom designers, and other 445</page><page sequence="8">José M. SANCHEZ-RON pre-quantum mechanics physicists, paved the way to the search for a modified or new electrodynamics, which eventually came to be esta blished under the name of "quantum mechanics". But when physicists set to the task of developing a quantum theory, whether in its prelimina ry (pre-1925) or in its final (post-1925) form, they encountered difficul ties. This led to some of them to think that maybe after all the difficul ties laid in a resort of the classical domain, the field concept. This was the case, for instance, with Walter Schottky in 1921. In his paper "The Problem of Causality in the Quantum Theory as a Basic Question for Modern Natural Science as a Whole"11, that has been commented by Paul Forman in his now classic "Weimar Culture, Causality and Quantum Theory, 1918-1927"12, Schottky put forward the idea that there might be a direct connection between the emitting and the absor bing atom by retarded action-at-a-distance, so that at the moment when a quantum is emitted it is already predetermined where, when and by which atom it will be absorbed. But Schottky did not develop his idea, nor did he find any kind of mathematical support for it. One year later, in 1922, a physicist from Amsterdam, Hugo Martin Tetrode, wrote a paper entitled "On the Action Function of the World. An Extension of Classical Dynamics"13, where the field concept was also criticized. But before turning to this paper I cannot avoid the temptation of saying a few words about the life of this extraordina ry physicists, in as much as he is very little known and does not appear in any dictionary of scientific biographies. As you will see this fact is quite justified. Hugo Martin Tetrode was born on March 7, 1895, and died, prematurely, on January 18, 1931, of tuberculosis1 *. His father, Pieter Johari Conrad Tetrode (1863-1955), Dr. of law, was wellknown in the world of finance. He was managing director of the "Nederlandsche Bank" (the official bank of the Netherlands) from 1919 to 1934. Apparently Hugo Martin, a very clever young of poor health and of a retiring disposition, never held any academic position, nor even got a degree. We know that he was registered at the University of Leip zig during 1910-11. At Leipzig he must have written his first paper dealing with the chemical constant and the quantum15. He was then</page><page sequence="9">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY 16 years old. There is no evidence he continued his studies at some other German university. Apparently, Tetrode did not enjoy at all direct communica tions. Ehrenfest invited him several times to visit him at Leiden (remem ber he was living in nearby Amsterdam), but he always refused. The story that Einstein, who as we shall see had a very good opinion of Tetrode's habilities as a physicist, wanted to pay him a visit and was sent back at the front door was told to Prof. Casimir by several peo ple. Around 1930 Pauli complained that physicists in Holland knew Tetro de existed but that nobody seemed to know him. No doubt, the fact that Tetrode was financially independent may have enhanced a tendency towards seclusion. On the other hand it enabled him to do outstanding work, notwithstanding his poor health. But forgive me for having used this opportunity to pay a small hommage to this Dutch physicist, to whom, I have to confess, I do admire, and let us proceed with our story, and in particular with his paper "On the Action Function of the World. An Extension of Classi cal Dynamics". Tetrode thought that theories based on the field concept, like Mie's, cannot explain the quantum events. It seems that these events one. not connected with the JLLeM mocLeJP. For this reason he chose: "a di^enjent standpoint... considering as piimau/ elements those who¿e existence. is given to us dúiectly and ocpeytlmentaMy -th&amp;. negative and positive- elect/ions which can even te counted and who-ie individual m otions can He traced afted\ He also "as¿ume(s) that each change 0/ the motion 0/ an election cLe.pends on othe/i ele.ctn.ons and ... tieat/¿) the fiuM. as a■ mathematical construction thai, in the £¿mit case in which the quantum naiime of. the events can Le diMegaaded is Miiia&amp;Jle. to aepiesent the. interaction between the ete.ctn.ons, but teave(s) us with misleading im pnesttons". Tetrode also arrived to the variational principle already disco vered by Schwarzschild, but he did not spend much time with it, because 447</page><page sequence="10">José M. SANCHEZ-RON as I have said his problem was the quantum. So, he asserted that "m want to• geneAa&amp;ize thii expne&amp;tion which ha* been derived fnom the c&amp;iAMcal equations of the. elcctjiomagnetic. field, limiting the number. of mathematicaMy poóáiJUe. ¿otution* in -iuch a way that oa£- permitted to expect that the generalization will coven, the. quantum, phenomena a* weM\ Taking into account these equations and what we know of Albert Einstein's scientific struggles, it is hardly surprising to find that late in August 1922, the creator of the relativity theories would write to his friend Paul Ehrenfest "a ueyiy in*púied work by 7etnode concerning the quantum pio blem, Penhapó he it, night; in any ca¿e thiA wonk indicate* a mind of. the fi/ut, nank, Ton. a long time I have not ¿een anything 40 M.mply presented". A measure of Einstein's real interest on Tetrode's ideas comes from the fact that he, who never was good in remembering other's works, did refer again to Tetrode's paper during the ceremony which took place when he was named, on. March 4, 1923, corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Madrid. On that occasion Einstein said16 "you (that is, Bias Cabrera) have a¿io taken into comidenation the weak point of. the theony of tight quanta, difficult pnobie^m of our. phy¿ici¿ü&gt;' generation.

Even in the forties Einstein would remember, as we shall see, Tetrode's ideas. Finally, and as this is not the occasion to discuss in detail Tetrode's electrodynamically-inspired ideas on the quantum, let me point out that he also had a clear understanding of the counter-intuitive consequences entailed by the introduction of non-instantaneous Lorentz-in variant actions at a distance, and that nevertheless, he was willing to accept them. Thus, he wrote in a now famous quotation: 448</page><page sequence="11">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY "Ike. -sun would not nadiaie if ii weae alone, in Apace, and no othea. ÍLodieó could aJLsonA.

In this sense Tetrode's ideas of the physical meaning of direct interactions were very much like the ones which a few years later would be vigorously defended by the American chemist-physicist Gilbert Newton Lewis, ideas that have been studied in detail by Roger H. Stuewer17 to whose paper I remit here. FOKKER AND THE "INVERSE" PRINCIPLE OF CORRESPONDENCE I shall now discuss the work of Fokker, Lorentz's former Ph. D. student, who in 1929 published a paper entitled "An Invariant Variational Principle for the Motion of Several Charged Mass Particles"18, dealing with the same kind of problems treated by Tetrode. Fokker's main result was what Schwarzchild and Tetrode had already proved, that is, that Maxwell's equation can be derived from an action-at-a distance standpoint (there are, however, no references to these papers in Fokker's work; the same happens in Tetrode's with respect to Schwarz schild). Fokker's motivation was essentially the same as Tetrode's, howe ver, his paper was less imaginative; but this was not a weakness, on the contrary, it was the core of its strenth, because being less dispersi ve, its message could be less easily forgotten (so it happens that in the present literature the variational principle discovered previously by Schwarzschild and Tetrode is usually called Fokker's principle). The task faced by Fokker was clear from the very first line' of his paper. He wrote: "Quantum, mechanics haA taken Ha ¿taniúng point ty a cowieApon cLence to the classical theony {.01 the dynamics of a ¿ingle paniir cíe, and haA fonmulated Ha law-s and methods ¿01 the. one-tody pn.oUe.rn ILy relating them to Hamilton'i canonical equations.

Tetrode was well within the "quantum connection", and in this sense he had much in common with Fokker, but the way in which he saw the relationship between quantum and classical physics was much more rudimentary than Fokker's. This was due to several reasons: In the first place, no quantum mechanics existed in 1922, when Tetrode did his work. The second reason is closely related to the previous one: once Heisenberg-Schrodinger's non-relativistic quantum mechanics was established, it became obvious that an inmediate problem to solve was to find its relativistic "generalization"; at this stage Fokker realized that, as far as the relativistic interaction between several particles was concerned, the problem was really serious because it was not even know how to set the classical Hamiltonian formalism. Naturally, and this is my third reason, which merges itself with the second one, to appreciate the meaning of "really serious" one has to take into account that Fokker was at the time under the influence of Niels Bohr "philoso phy", one of whose tenets was the principle of correspondence. In order to use Bohr's principle it was compulsory to know the corresponding classical theory. Fokker realized that on this occasion there was none. So, he tried to solve the quantum problem turning towards the resolution of the corresponding classical one. Twenty years later P.A.M. Dirac20, a great supporter of the inverse principle of correspondence, would follow the same idea that Fokker, to open what is now a flourishing field of research in classical relativistic dynamics: The "relativistic dyna mics of interacting (any interaction in principle) particles".

ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, QUANTUM THEORY AND AC CTIONS AT A DISTANCE: WHEELER AND FEYNMAN One of the features -probably the most important and intri guing- of the Schwarzschild-Tetrode-Fokker's formulation of electrodyna mics is that it introduces advanced as well as retarded interactions between the charged particles. Actually, this is a necessity if one wants to write up an action-at-a-distance variational principle leading to Max well's equations, but at the same time it means' that electromagnetic radiation does not appear in the theory. Let us leave aside for a mo ment this important problem, and point out that there were other physi cists who did not use fields in their works on electrodynamics, but that however remained attached to what we might call the "retarded tradi tion". One of the principal exponents of this line of thought was Walther Ritz who chose to face the electrodynamical puzzles by developing22 an emission theory that is also an action-at-a-distance one. Among the points on which Ritz insisted was the denial of advanced interactions. This was also one of the issues of debate in the discussion he held with his friend Einstein, a discussion which was summarized in a short joint paper23 published in 1909. In that paper Einstein put forward the idea that "irreversibili ty" -very much attached as we know to electromagnetic retarded interac tions- "rests exclusively upon grounds of probability", and that to him there was nothing wrong with the fact that the elementary interactions were time-symmetric. As it turns out this was one of the clues which in the early forties would permit the Princeton physicists J.A. Wheeler and his then Ph.D. student Richard P. Feynman, to solve the problem of how to introduce the electromagnetic radiation into the Schwarzschild Tetrode-Fokker's formulation. Wheeler and Feynman's papers21* of 1945 and 1949 gave to the action-at-a-distance concept a status of respectabi lity that has remained since them. In the U.S., for instance, a large 451</page><page sequence="14">José M. SANCHEZ-RON number of physicists read their papers when they appeared. Alfred Lan dé for example, wrote in 19502S: " 7 hein. the. o ay hcu&gt; p/wvoked much unpu blished ¿avonaMe. a/&gt; uieM oa adveAAe. com mesdy". Probably because of the personality of the authors, the attractive way in which the theory was presented, or because it appeared in the issues of the prestigious Reviews of Modern Physics dedicated to Bohr (1945) and Einstein (1949), on the occasion of their sixtieth and seventieth birthdays, respectively, the fact is that Wheeler and Feynman's electrodynamics has had, and still has, a great influence. Similarly to the cases already discussed, Wheeler and Feyn man's motivation was not to enlarge or continue Tetrode's or Fokker's contributions to classical electrodynamics. (As a matter of fact they did not know of the existence of these papers until they were hard at work; Einstein informed Wheeler about Tetrode's ideas). What they wanted was -once more- to face some problems in the physics of the microcosmos. Wheeler, as he tells us26, was struggling with the idea of whether the electron would not be after all the basic particle whose theoretical description would enable him to set up a satisfactory nuclear theory. He found support for his idea in Dirac's successful relativistic theory of the electron and he was not deterred by the discovery of the neutron (1932), nor by Fermi's theory of the 6-decay (1933). Thus, if the electron were really the basic particle, and if he were to question what he called the Stron-Force Credo, "how then couM one escape, a caA&amp;fid. £ook at the. wtenactic&gt;n between highly acceleAoted rieJkdÁiú^tic eAecbiorvi". 7ki/, wa/&gt; the ae.cu&gt;on.

Thus, his student Gilbert N. Plass submitted in 1946 a Thesis entitled "Black Body Radiation in the Theory of Action at a Distance", the results of which should have been included in the finally never published sequel to the 1945-49 Wheeler and Feynman's papers. Also, Wheeler tried to develop an extension of his and Feynman's theory which would cover gravitation too. There was, in this sense, a rather interesting interchange of letters between Einstein and Wheeler latter in 1943. Let me just quote a few paragraphs of the three interchanged letters29. On November 3, 1943 Wheeler wrote to Einstein: "Since the. time, when I got leave of a&amp;Aenca, from Pninceton University to help with the. loan, project which you initiaJued, I have, had Utile, oppontwúty to return to Pninceton, and even leM to wo/tk upon the. theory of. action at a distance, however, since ihe time when fln, Teynman and I diácuMed with you ihe. interpretation of. ihe. fon.ce of nadkitiue nje.action in terms of advanced and netanled action at a distance, I have had ¿orne further success with the extension of this iheony, which may &lt;Le coded ihe 'theory of wonM lines', I should tike very much to visit you and see. if you cannot helfi me Letter. to ¿ee where ihe fon.ce of gravitation f¡ÍA into the. point of view of the iheony I have mentionedI". Three days later Einstein answered Wheeler. He was very glad if Wheeler could visit him, but "I am afraid that I cannot help you very much in your endea vour. hi hat I approve wholeheartedly in youn. attempt iti the prin cipie ihat nothing should (Le. introduced in ihe fundament which i,i not ¿ym met/iic concerning ihe time direction, On the other, hand it seem ó to me ihat a concept ¿ike a finite ninkowskian distance can never He neconcifer! with ihe principie. of g&amp;ieral r£JkitÍLÚtyw, After the visit, which took place the 14th of November, Wheeler wrote, on December 2, a very long letter to Einstein. Let me just quote a few sentences:</page><page sequence="16">José M. SANCHEZ-RON "I te.fi- you (that is, Einstein) with a íeiten. idea how to develop a "p/únciple. of cowieApondence" between the general theoiy of rieJatÜMÍy and the genejwi theouy of action at a distance* In the meantime it haó pnoued po&amp;úMe. to cAzan. up an apparent diócnepancy between the. two points of. view, a dLLicsiepancy in the. idealized caAe of a univenAe containing tioo maMeA.

Some time ago (29 June 1978) he wrote to me: "Action-at-a-distance ÍA a wonde^fuL way to deACAiHe intenacUonj itut it pneMippoAeA, Teynman and I now ag/ie^, what we now know ¿i quite a wiong Jxiea of a paMlrf^, Thai, i/&gt; why I gave up my 1949-50 woik on action-at-a-distance in g/iavitaiton ..." Nevertheless, once a theory or world-view becomes influential it does not take long before other scientists set out to apply it to diffe rent topics. It would seem now natural to speak of the many contribu tions of Havas, Hogarth, Bondi, Hoyle or Narlikar, and also, no doubt of the so-called predictive relativistic mechanics approach, but that would take me too far. Moreover, it is never a good thing to get too close to our days. THE PHILOSOPHER'S PERSPECTIVE On return, on this last part of my lecture, I shall deal with a few philosophical topics which show the interest of paying attention to the action-at-a-distance concept in XXth century physics, A fundamental assumption for many empirically-minded philo sophers of the first decades of our century was the existence of a dis tinction between theoretical and nontheoretical terms, distinction which was considered crucial for a proper understanding of the concepts and methods of science. Precisely this fact is one of the reasons that makes the action-at-a-distance and fields concepts philosophically important to me: their characteristics with respect to the distinction "theoreti cal-non-theoretical" are totally different. So if we take a sufficiently weak -and remember that I am taking a historian's point of view- defini 454</page><page sequence="17">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY tion of nontheoretical term, allowing microscopic physical objects such as electrons and other elementary particles to be considered nontheoreti cal terms, then it is clear that the action-at-a-distance concept belongs to this last class of terms. On the contrary the field concept -only indirectly measurable by means of test particles- is a theoretical term. The importance of the previous considerations becomes evident when one remembers that two of the schools which dominated philoso phy of science during part of the present century, namely, operationalism and logical positivism, suspected of unobservables. One could think there fore that it would have been quite natural for the followers of these doctrines to prefer the action-at-a-distance concept instead of the field one. However, nothing of the sort happened because both doctrines are different. Bridgman (i.e. operationalism) accepted action-at-a-distance while those logical positivists that made clear their positions (at least to the best of my knowledge) favoured fields. To understand this beha viour it will suffice to review briefly the essential ideas of both doctri nes. To Bridgman a scientific concept had to be linked to measu ring procedures. He observed that3 °: "if &lt;Ly convention we agrien to iu&gt;e only thote conce.pt&gt;&gt; in devenir ting phyMjcai ¿ituatianA to wich we. can give a meaning in ten-mi of. ph.y¿icaJt openaiÁcnA, then we aw. ¿une. that we AhaM. not have to ietaact}\ Although responding to the same basic idea, i.e. physical concepts beyond experimental control should be regarded as metaphysical, logical positivism had more flexible requirements: theoretical concepts are allowed, something which does not happen in Bridgman's system. Taking into account that the field concept is one of those theoretical terms, the study of Bridgman's ideas in connection with the action-at-a-distance and fields concepts takes on a special significan ce. As it turns out Bridgman was somewhat in favour of the convenience of using actions at a distance, pitilessly criticising at the same time the notion of fields. Let me just present two pieces of evidence in this sense. In his contribution to the Schilpp's volume, Einstein: Philoso pher-Scientist, Bridgman31 wrote:</page><page sequence="18">José M. SANCHEZ-RON "The. advantage and necessity of the. fieM paint of view is uMiaMy considered ¿o te. that it avoids the cUfficuíties of the. oíd ac tJcn-at-a-cLútance point of view... I believe, howeven, that an analysis of. the openations that ana. used in specifying what the fieJld is, will show that the conceptual dilemma by no means has teen successfully met,,. One has in no way ejconcised the misteny of the successive appearance, of a foice. at successive test-bodies by the invention of the field And his classic The Logic of Modern Physics, he stated32: n7he situation with respect to action at a distance. is typical of the general situation, I beiieve the essence of the explanatory process is such that we mutt be preponed to accept as an ultima te fon. our explanations the mene statement of a connotation between phenomena, on. situations with which we ane sufficiently familiar? Although he was completely right in pointing out the falla ciousness of some objections people used against actions at a distance, Bridgirian's methodological opposition to fields shows in an extremely clear manner the limitations of his philosophy. As 1 have already mentioned, the formal possibilities offered by logical positivism differed in at least one important aspect from those provided by operationalism: theoretical terms have a place into logical positivism, and fields are thus allowed. However, perhaps someone would have expected of logical positivists at least a sympathy for a "more empirical" concept (namely, the action-at-a-distance one), arguing that they were supposed to suspect of unobservables. Nevertheless, the little evidence that I have found suggests that what happened was that many logical positivists considered the action-at-a-distance as refuted by the physics of their time (by relativity in particular). (Let me say in this connection that although it is not proved here, I believe that in general the field concept exerced a strong attraction on logical posi tivists; one of the reasons for this could have been precisely that this concept provides a very good example of the utility of introducing "theo retical terms" as basic constituents of scientific theories.) 456</page><page sequence="19">PHYSICS AND PHILOSOPHY An interesting example is provided by Moritz Schlick. In 1925 he wrote33: "Oua inteyipnetation of. the conce.pt of fo/ice. u&gt;a-i made, on the. tLa¿ió of the. empinical fact thai "foiceA which act at a distance" do not ejciit, and. that existence, can only He a/&gt;CAiied to actions which one. pAjopagated continuously fnom point to point?. The many shortcomings that plagued operationalism and logi cal positivism were to become notorious after a long period in which not very many other voices were heard. Among those who have been trying to revise the basic tenets of these two doctrines is Mario Bunge, whose opinions as regards actions at a distance and fields are interes ting, although they do not agree with mine. I will not discuss, however, Bunge's ideas in as much as I have done it already3". Let me only say, nevertheless, that although probably the majority of present philosophers think, like Bunge, that only fields ought to be admitted in modern, relati vistic, physics, there are some who cannot accept such "rule". One of these cases is Hilary Putnam who in a paper ("In Defence of Internal Realism") shortly to be published in Teorema states that as far as meta physics is concerned there are no reasons why we should prefer fields to actions at a distance. All these cases remember us the necessity of a careful analy sis of the meaning of this counterintuitive concept, called action-at a-distance. Modern philosophy pretends, at least in some of its branches, to have adopted high standards of rigor in logical analysis. However, not always it has been able to free itself from old prejudices or from uncritically accepting the points of view of the majority of today-physi cists. It is one of my contentions that the case of the action-at-a-distan ce concept shows rather clearly this point, independently from the fact that actual physics happens to be -and there is no room for any re grets- to a large extent "field-physics".
