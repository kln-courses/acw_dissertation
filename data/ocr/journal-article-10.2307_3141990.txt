<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME PRINCIPLES FOR SCRIPTURE INTERPRETATION PROFESSOR EDWARD E. BRAITHWAITE, PH.D. University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada Few matters in the realm of Christian scholarship have led to more diverse results than the interpretation of the Scriptures. One has only to call to mind a few cases based on rabbinical, alle- gorical, scholastic, and other modes of interpretation. Elkanah's two wives were taken to represent the synagogue and the church. Peter's two swords proved the pope to possess both spiritual and temporal authority. "The greater light" in Gen., chap. i, repre- sented the pope, and "the lesser light," the emperor. Proof of the Trinity was found in the fact that the letters of the second word of Genesis are the initials of the Hebrew words for Son, Spirit, Father. One of the shoes whose latchet John was not worthy to unloose was made to symbolize the Incarnation. Shiloh was identified with Messiah because the numerical value of the letters of the two names was equal. The world would last six thousand years because it was six days in being created, and in the Lord's sight a day was as a thousand years. From the injunction "Feed my lambs," it was inferred that popes had authority over kings. Nor has more modern interpretation been free from almost equally unwarrantable methods. Not to mention many less plausible views, the commonly accepted understanding of the Song of Songs as a conversation between Christ and his church would scarcely occur to the ordinary reader without the allegorical chapter-headings of the King James version. Jesus could never be claimed as an ascetic except on the basis of a few isolated texts. The "proof-text" method, indeed, has been most general, though by it one may often establish two contradictory propositions. The authority of Scripture is even used to oppose the practice of vaccination (Matt. 9: I 2; Gal. 6:7), supported by the fact that most of those who are vaccinated become ill, though one might 118</page><page sequence="2">SOME PRINCIPLES FOR SCRIPTURE INTERPRETATION II9 as reasonably argue against a sea voyage from the common experience of seasickness. Opening the Bible at random to receive inspired direction is perhaps little better, though a device used even by John Wesley. While most such instances are to be credited to the untrained mind, there are doubtless others to be ascribed to a very different type of interpreter. One can scarcely refrain from mentioning here Cheyne's favorite "Jerahmeelite" theory, in which he claims that many names have been corrupted from Jerahmeel, such as Amalek, Hamul, Jamlech, Carmel, Kemuel, etc., making the Jerahmeelite clan of much greater importance than would appear. Erbt's theory that Elijah, Elisha, and Jonah correspond to the deities Shamash, Sin, and Ishtar, and these in their turn to the Babylonian gods Anu, Bel, and Ea, seems equally far-fetched. In view of such conditions, one may well sympathize with Maurice's expression of wonder "that the faith of scientific men in the Bible has not utterly perished, when they see by what tricks we are sustaining it." The enumeration of certain principles, therefore, which may be adopted in the light of present-day knowl- edge, may be serviceable to the cause of better interpretation. Three groups of such principles are here proposed: historical, literary, and philosophical. i. There may be emphasized at the outset the importance of considering the whole history of the formation of the Bible. As the canon was determined by vote, what if Ecclesiastes or Esther had been excluded, or if the Wisdom of Solomon or the letters of Clement had been accepted ? The free use of one another's writ- ings by the various authors is also to be observed. In the story of the rich young man, Mark has "Good Master, what shall I do . . . . ? Why callest thou me good ? None is good save one, even God." But in Matthew this becomes: "Master, what good thing shall I do . . . . ? Why askest thou me concerning that which is good?" the purpose of the change apparently being "to avoid the appearance of our Lord's calling in question his own goodness, and of his refusing to accept the attribution to himself of what is divine."' Consider the significance of a list of altera- 'See Burkitt, The Gospel History and Its Transmission, p. I8.</page><page sequence="3">120 THE BIBLICAL WORLD tions in the text, like that given by Jiilicher,2 including slips of the pen, faults of memory, confusions between related prepositions and conjunctions, marginal insertions, etc. Note again the many manuscript variations, such as the omission by some of Mark I6:9- 20, and John 7:53-8: ii. Compare Exod. 35-40 and its parallel Exod. 25-31 in the Greek and Hebrew texts, showing the strangest variations in order of paragraphs that are themselves almost identical, and proving that the whole section was in confusion until well down to the time of the Christian era. The Hebrew and Samaritan texts, likewise, exhibit discrepancies in the ages of the antediluvian patriarchs and in other dates and figures. The recognition of a varying attitude toward doctrinal, ritual, theological, and moral standards embodies another essential principle. There is evidence, for example, of the widespread influence of the common notion of antiquity that each country had its own deity. Jonah fled toward Tarshish "from the presence of Jehovah" (Jonah 1:3). Ruth exclaimed: "Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God" (Ruth 1:16), and Boaz claims a reward for her from "Jehovah, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge" (Ruth 2: 12). Naaman wanted to take back to Syria two loads of Israelitish earth, i.e., Jehovah's land, that he might set up a Jehovah altar (II Kings 5:17). The Assyrian king had to send back an Israelitish priest to teach the new colonists whom he had placed in Palestine the manner of Jehovah, "the god of the land" (II Kings, chap.17). The circulation of the "book of the law"--Deuteronomy-marks a sort of boundary line between two different attitudes to the high places. Jehu's action in exterminating the house of Ahab is highly commended in II Kings o10:30, but severely condemned by Hosea (Hos. 1:4).3 The ascription of David's numbering of Israel to Jehovah in II Sam., chap. 24, and to Satan in I Chron., chap. 21, is only a difference of theology. Early Israel made God the One Cause of all things. The second passage comes from a late period, and may be influenced by Persian theology, which was dualistic. There are different moral standards, failure to 2 An Introduction to the New Testament, Eng. tr., pp. 588-99. 3 For a fuller discussion, see Budde, Religion, of Israel, pp. 125 ff.</page><page sequence="4">SOME PRINCIPLES FOR SCRIPTURE INTERPRETATION I21 recognize which has deceived even the elect. Luther countenanced the bigamy of Philip because the patriarchs had more than one wife. Professsor E. F. Scott shows how the Fourth Gospel often corrects the misconceptions of the earlier disciples.4 Each author's distinctive point of view must also be carefully noted. We cannot judge the relative importance of the events in Chronicles by their prominence there, for the author's special interest leads him to expand his narrative at certain points, as when it has to do with the temple; while elsewhere he rigidly curtails it. The special standpoint of the Deuteronomic editor of Kings leads him to pass judgment on the kings according to their attitude to the high places. But this cannot be regarded as a permanent criterion comparable with New Testament standards. This implies that the biblical writers had important limitations. This they readily acknowledged, as did Jesus himself (e.g., Mark 13:32). The historical background must, of course, always be kept in mind. Professor Kirkpatrick shows how New Testament Greek is wedded to Hebrew thought in the Septuagint, and cannot be rightly understood except through that version, and how important New Testament terms have already a history when they are adopted.5 The "Minor Prophets" must be sealed books to those ignorant of the contemporaneous history. But read Amos or Hosea in the light of the movements of Assyria in the momentous eighth century B.C., and they are "minor" prophets no longer. The very order of the prophetical books suggests the hopeless con- fusion that must result without knowing their environment. A recent writer's tentative arrangement may be considered sufficiently correct for illustration. This gives the dates before Christ as follows: 740, 626, 592, 168, 745, 400, 760, 450, 450, 700, 650, 6oo00, 630, 520, 520, 540. Attention to the historical perspective is another highly impor- tant matter. The Epistle to the Hebrews argues at great length the superiority of Jesus to prophets and angels, to Moses and Aaron. But we admit all this before the argument begins. Of 4 See The Fourth Gospel, pp. 302 f. s See The Divine Library of the Old Testament, p. 126.</page><page sequence="5">122 THE BIBLICAL VWORLD what value to us, then, is this epistle? The proper perspective shows us. While angels are practically absent from our theology, they had a large place with the Jews, particularly in later Judaism. We wonder that even early Christians should need such elementary instruction. How slightly they must have appreciated their new mount of privilege! Yet this is only typical of the appalling ignorance of Christ shown by his contemporaries in general. Again, if an inquirer today is told to "believe on the Lord Jesus," or, "whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God," he is apt to declare that he has always believed this but without finding the peace for which he longs. It is another case of per- spective. Men of the first century had difficulty in crediting Christ's great claim. The apostles expected that those who really believed in him would follow him. Here then is the vital application for us. Living in the keen realization of this fact, let us be sure that our lives correspond with the great truth we so readily acknowl- edge. Similarly, as to the greatness of Jesus in general. No Old or New Testament writer has adequately described him. He is, indeed, too great to be accurately classified or categorically defined. But how much better so, than if God had dictated an exact formal description. How vastly superior the simple gospel picture to the elaborate metaphysical definitions of the creeds. 2. Among literary principles, it is of first importance to recog- nize the oriental character of the Bible in general; and, in particular, the style of literature of the book or passage under consideration. In no other oriental book should we think of interpreting literally talking serpents or trees bestowing the knowledge of good and evil. What a difference whether Jonah be literal history or parable. If the former, the book ends in a decided anticlimax-Jonah pray- ing to be allowed to die. But if a parable, a splendid climax is reached, showing, in contrast with Jonah's poor conception, how far-reaching is the love of God. Hosea is a case from the opposite point of view. The opening chapters certainly read like a personal narrative. Symbolic interpretations have been adopted, only because it has been felt that God would not command Hosea to marry such a woman as described. But the oriental mind does not face the same difficulty. Hosea could marry her without</page><page sequence="6">SOME PRINCIPLES FOR SCRIPTURE INTERPRETATION 123 recognizing any divine command or knowing her real character. Then, as in his love for her he tries to win her back, God uses his experience to show that his love for faithless Israel was certainly no less. The prophet could thus easily see afterward the hand of Providence in it all and truly say that God had led him to marry her-yea, even commanded it-that he might make more vivid the revelation of his unchanging love. When the Psalmist says, "The mountains melted like wax at the presence of Jehovah" (Ps. 97:5), the idea of a miraculous manifestation never occurs to a sane mind, as if this were prose. Why, then, should a miracle necessarily be chronicled in Josh. 1o: 12, 13, where the poetic form is properly adopted by the revisers ? Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; And thou, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon. Without opposition to miracles in general, one may see that this, translated into prose, may be only a prayer that sufficient daylight be granted to give the Israelites time to gain a victory. Apoca- lyptic literature, too, must be recognized as such. How many schemes for the future, for which Daniel and Revelation have been made responsible, have been proven delusive! Jillicher says of the latter: "Any extravagance could find its authority in this book, so long as people started from the false assumption that the author's visions had already been, or would hereafter be literally fulfilled."6 Due allowance must likewise be made for the char- acteristic use of anthropomorphism. It need not be imagined that God uttered his creative edicts in human language. It is no more necessary to suppose that Abraham heard an audible voice telling him to offer Isaac than when a man now says that he was com- manded by God to do a certain thing. References to God's anger, joy, repentance, are marks of the same tendency. Again, the literary material of the Bible is not only adapted for widely varying purposes, but for these purposes also there is no uniform value. While some books are suitable for devotional ends, the main interest of others is historical; but these may have very different historical value. Professor W. R. Smith went so 6 An Introduction to the New Testament, Eng. tr., p. 266.</page><page sequence="7">124 THE BIBLICAL WORLD far as to say: "The practice of using the Chronicles as if they had the same historical value as the older books has done more than any other one cause to prevent a right understanding of the Old Testament."' There are also varying moral standards. No longer do we justify slavery or polygamy because they were approved by biblical writers. The Jews themselves made a distinction in their Scriptures, giving first place to the law, second to the prophets, and lowest of all to the writings. The textual and contextual relations of a passage must, of course, be always regarded. This raises the question of the study of Hebrew. It may be doubted whether this is not in danger of being too greatly slighted. Even a moderate knowledge of Hebrew will bring within the minister's reach some of the best helps which he cannot otherwise adequately appreciate. And how can he without this comprehend the significance of "higher criticism," which goes directly back to the original languages ? Besides, exegesis is one of the most fruitful sources of legitimate and force- ful sermonizing. Professor G. A. Smith, in urging the study of Hebrew, says that it is the "painstaking students . ... who lay their hands on the prophet's heart and feel it beat; it is they who across the ages see the very features of his face as he calls; it is they into whom his style and music pass." Our next natural consideration is that of the large human ele- ment in divine revelation. There has been too prominent a tendency to explain events solely from their divine point of view; e.g., the landing of William of Orange in England and its many beneficial results. The inscription on the medal commemorating the defeat of the Spanish Armada-afflavit Deus et dissipati sunt- appears to assign the whole matter to God. But if this be pushed to its logical conclusion, what about God's leading where there is no clear evidence of his interposition; and what about his presence in the ordinary affairs of life as well as the extraordinary ? How many human adjustments had to be made to fulfil the promise to Abraham: "I will make of thee a great nation." The selling of Joseph and the oppression by one of the pharaohs are only two of the many human links in a long chain. The continuance of Judah 7 See more fully The Old Testament in the Jewish Church, Lecture V.</page><page sequence="8">SOME PRINCIPLES FOR SCRIPTURE INTERPRETATION 125 long after northern Israel may be largely explained by the greater nearness of the latter to Assyria, by the comparative lack of unity in the north, and by the fact that the armies of Egypt and Assyria were constantly marching through the heart of Israel while they only skirted the border of Judah. Isaiah's prediction of Assyria's approach to Jerusalem and her subsequent fate (Isa., chap. io) illustrates a prophet's limitations. While the outstanding feature of the prophecy was fulfilled, Isaiah was in error as to the route taken. The prophets evidently expected only a conditional ful- filment of many of their prophecies, as shown by their constant exhortations to repentance. Such a view tends to bring these events down to the plane of our own affairs, or, more correctly, to lift our human lives to their proper divine relations. If Moses and Isaiah and Amos were not subject to limitations like ours, their message to us is vitally weakened. But if, in spite of this, they could think and speak and act so divinely, they are a mighty inspiration to us in our struggle to realize the divine image accord- ing to which we are made and the divine ideal implanted within us. It must further be remembered that our notion of literary property is distinctly modern. There was nothing in antiquity approaching our idea of copyright. The history of the text shows that there was great freedom in inserting notes and adding extra- neous material. "While we write commentaries on the text, the early practice was to write commentaries in the text." Some books are compilations. The many titles in Proverbs (i: i; io: i, etc.) indicate various sections, which occur in an entirely different order in the Septuagint version, in part as follows: 24:22; 30:1-14; 24:23-34; 30:I5-3I:9; 25-29; 31:10-31. Again, Jeremiah's oracles against the nations (chaps. 46-51) are placed by the Septua- gint after chap. 13. This throws light on several characteristic features of biblical literature, e.g., (a) the incorporation of so con- siderable a section as Isa., chaps. 40-66, into Isaiah's original work; (b) the tendency to assign a book to some great name of the past, to strengthen its authority; (c) the interweaving of several documents into one product. In the story of the Red Sea, the first writer ascribes the deliverance to the agency of the wind, indicating an unusual but not miraculous occurrence. The second</page><page sequence="9">126 THE BIBLICAL WORLD writer introduces the miraculous division of the waters by Moses' staf, while this is further heightened in the last account, which pictures the piling-up of the waters like a wall at the extension of Moses' hand, and the destruction of all of Pharaoh's host. Thus a narrative may become greatly magnified, and the title of a book or chapter does not guarantee that all its contents were written by the author named, especially as these titles often originated at a late date. 3. As one of the principles of a philosophical or semi-philosophical nature, the use of reason may be worthy of mention, as there has been a curious hesitancy to accept this fully. Certain investiga- tions have been avoided as liable to be disturbing. Reason has even been held to be antagonistic to belief. This gave Paine's Age of Reason much of its success. Bishop Butler's incontrovertible words ought long since to have been final: "Reason is the only faculty whereby we have to judge of anything, even revelation itself." Yet there has been a tendency to recur to the patristic position-the more unreasonable a proposition, the greater its probability-implied by Tertullian's maxim, credo quia absurdum est. Reason must be limited, of course, to its own proper domain. There are also many different kinds of evidence. Mathematical, historical, and religious propositions differ greatly from one another. Reason can also afford to recognize its limitations even within its own sphere. Many things are beyond the range of ordinary com- prehension but not unreasonable, as recent discovery and invention abundantly prove. We live by Faith; but Faith is not the slave Of text and legend. Reason's voice and God's; Nature's and Duty's, never are at odds. Our knowledge- of God--derived in part, independently of the Bible, from the revelation of himself which he makes to all who have "ears to hear "-is another appropriate criterion. Any theory may be submitted to the test of God's justice or love or mercy. We may reverently raise the old question whether anyone could sin sufficiently for a just God to consign him to literal "everlasting burnings" or "unquenchable fire." This, however, is only one of several modes of approach which must be used to confirm or</page><page sequence="10">SOME PRINCIPLES FOR SCRIPTURE INTERPRETATION 127 correct one another, and that with great caution. Perhaps we cannot always know what absolute justice is; yet it can be no less a thing in God than in ourselves. Nothing can be good in Him Which evil is in me. The principle of retribution may serve as a similar criterion from the opposite point of view. If, for example, the future life should be a continuance of our present mode of life, with all sensual and bodily gratifications naturally removed, or any form of exclusion from the divine presence, must it not in any case be a sufficient doom? We can only speculate here, but there is value even in tentative solutions that provide a reasonable hypothesis for our own satisfaction. We must guard against understanding as a mere rule what is intended for a principle. When Jesus said, "If thy brother . . . . sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again . ... thou shalt forgive him" (Luke 17:34), he intended to teach the duty of unlimited forgiveness. But Peter took it as a rule- if he had this in mind when he asked: "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?" (Matt. 18: 21). He speaks as though he had forgiven someone several times and was doubtful as to his duty if the eighth occasion should arise. The reply was: "I say not unto thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven." Did Peter yet grasp the principle or would he have doubted whether he ought to have forgiven the four hundred and ninety-first time? The distinction is vital. One who tries to live by rule is constantly meeting problems he cannot solve. A young Christian reading the New Testament soon comes to the words, "Whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also" (Matt. 5:39). This he takes as a command to be literally obeyed. But in a few weeks he reads: "If thy brother sin, rebuke him" (Luke I7:3). How much more welcome this is. But a more serious thought follows: these passages contradict each other. Then ensues a season of doubt; and that because statements intended to teach principles were taken as rules. Similarly, although Jesus says, "Ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example"</page><page sequence="11">128 THE BIBLICAL W1-ORLD (John 13: 14 f.), this is almost universally ignored as a rule, while the few exceptions are regarded as the pitiable objects of a great delusion. What hopeless confusion, what bodily disfigurements, what social entanglements would result from literally obeying our Lord's precepts. If we plucked out an eye or cut off a hand when these members led us astray; if we gave the rest of our cloth- ing to the thief who had already stolen part; if we gave indiscrimi- nately to every beggar, what kind of a world would we have ? But when all this is seen to embody a principle of life to relieve us of anxiety as to bodily needs and material possessions, how comforting and stimulating it becomes. There is also considerable value even in a "probable" inter- pretation. As in science, we may at times assume a theory until we can prove its truth or falsity. Such theories, too, though finally abandoned, may be temporarily serviceable. The theory of verbal inspiration safeguarded the text during a critical period. The superiority of the spiritual power to the temporal, which has been called the great fraud of the Middle Ages, did much to pre- serve the external unity of the church. Erroneous creeds have helped some to maintain a certain fidelity when higher motives might have failed; and mistaken interpretations have sustained an orthodoxy that had temporary value. Finally, all acceptable principles must be based on induction rather than deduction. We must try to discover what has actually been God's procedure, instead of holding some a-priori theory regarding it. This a-priori reasoning has been far too common. It has been argued that the Bible as the channel of divine revela- tion must have no imperfection. But there is even stronger reason for arguing the perfection of the world and the race. Our only safe course, therefore, is carefully to examine the Bible itself before propounding a theory. If Genesis has two creation accounts, if events are narrated differently in Kings and Chronicles, if inci- dents connected with the occupation of Canaan are placed in one book after and in another before Joshua's death, the extent and significance of these variations must be measured, not to fit them into a preconceived theory, but to see what theory they will justify. In short, the above principles call for the application to the</page><page sequence="12">SOME PRINCIPLES FOR SCRIPTURE INTERPRETATION 129 Bible of the same common-sense methods as to any other literature. A book on grammar is judged mainly by its grammatical accuracy, but should be in harmony with the general knowledge of its day. Similarly the Bible ought to show traces of the scientific status of its own time. It is often claimed that the Bible must agree with science. But with what science? The science of today? That of a thousand years ago? Or that of pre-Christian times? If Genesis agreed with the science of its own day, it could not agree with ours, and vice versa. Such harmony could exist only at one particular epoch; and, on such a hypothesis, for all other ages the book would be worthless. The fact is that the Bible has come to us without any divine instructions or authorized interpretation. Being confirmed in the conviction of our fathers that it is the most important record of divine revelation, we may wisely adopt their conclusions as far as they are corroborated, and push on to further results of our own. There is a twofold danger in a transitional period like the present: first, that of passing from one extreme to another; second, that of too inflexible adherence to long cherished views. Even in the face of clear evidence, it was difficult to give up the notion that the earth was flat, as that seemed the biblical view. To adopt the heliocentric theory seemed almost blasphemous for the same reason. But our revised conceptions have been a great gain; and that because we have come nearer to the truth. Every actual advance toward the truth is to be heartily welcomed, however start- ling it may at first appear; for, if it is sound truth, it is an advance toward freedom and toward God.</page></plain_text>
