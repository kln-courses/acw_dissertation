Übersetzt von Uwe Brügmann und Gert Meyer. Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag München 1969. 227 S. DM 3,80 = Sonder- reihe dtv Band 74. In this little volume Richard Lorenz has put together a fair number of documents centering around the theory and practice of the Proletkult, taken mostly from the periodical "Proletarskaja kul'tura" and the publications of organizations and individ- uals identified with the movement. The documents deal with its ambitious plans and organizations and show its specific application in the fields of poetry, theatre, the visual arts, music, and finally education, with a few illustrations supplementing the text. In his brief introduction the editor has sketched the short-lived history of the Proletkult as a socio-cultural movement supported by half a million people that staged, for its most striking manifestation, some extraordinary spectacles in Petrograd in 1920; he has also indicated some of its problems. The volume serves as a con- venient introduction into a commonly neglected and yet important aspect of the Bolshevik revolution - the Maoist aspect one is almost tempted to say. It also sup- plements and offsets the predilection for political history shown by most students of the subject. Besides, some of the ambitions and problems of the Proletkult have a strong contemporary ring. Problems there certainly were galore. The Proletkult had a double origin 1) in the desire for spontaneity of the Russian working class movement expressed most strongly in the rise of the Soviets in 1917 and 2) in the eagerness of Marxist intellectuals to help "the proletariat" create its proper class culture according to the slogan: "The proletariat must in every field go its own way and find its own values." In the Russian context of the First World War and its aftermath this combination was fraught with debilitating contradictions. One, for instance, consisted in the dominant role in the formulation and leadership of the Proletkult played by the intelligencija. According to the short biographies supplied by the editor, the leading spokesmen of the movement were at least second generation members of the intelligencija or had by profession, political activity, or emigration moved into it. They were, further- more, close to the intellectual currents of the day, influenced not only by Marxism and Leninism (to various degrees), but also by futurism, urbanism, and machinism; in their poetry, for instance, flowers and iron were oftçn conjoined in a sickly anthropomorphism. The most challenging author in this collection is no doubt A. K. Gastev. Son of a teacher, trained as a mechanic, he had early joined the RSDRP and lived for several years in the emigration. After the revolution he was First Secretary of the All-Russian Metal Workers' Union and eventually (until 1938) director of the Central Labor Institute dedicated to the study of the Taylor system and the psychology and physiology of the industrial worker. His poem "We Grow Out of Iron" [My rastem iz zeleza] was highly praised at the time as the best of proletarian poetry, but he was much more daring as a theorist of the proletarian culture of the future, which welded together "catastrophism" and "dynamics" and gloriously transformed the proletarian into a social automaton. Would a live worker - or Karl Marx - have voluntarily moved in that frightening direction? The deliberate effort to shape the proletariat into a new mold is reflected in many of these documents. As one writer put it: "You have to interest the broad masses of the</page><page sequence="2">448 Besprechungen workers in taking part of the work for the new culture" - obviously they did not come to it spontaneously. An essential, and in the long run most needed, effort of the Proletkult was directed toward public enlightenment of a rather traditional kind, introducing some advanced Western ideas and techniques. Many documents reflect the positive response of the workers, but some also testify to their uncultured ways. Theoreticians of the Proletkult like A. A. Bogdanov or P. M. Kerzencev were not really willing to proletarianize the high standards inherited from bourgeois culture in art, literature, or intellectual precision. The problem was most clearly stated in regard to the proletarian theatre. What should proletarian theatre be, amateur per- formances for workers geared to their vulgar taste or an expression of proletarian culture superior to the bourgeois stage? Good acting, furthermore, required specialized training that took badly needed workers from the shop; the foremen would not allow that. But how could even the best bourgeois actors hope to act in the true proletarian spirit? The same difficulty recurred in the discussion of the relations between the supposedly superior proletarian culture and the past (and inferior) bourgeois culture. If "in the bright world of the future the girls will grow more beautiful than the Venus of Milo" (as one would-be poet put it), would there be any use for the Greek original or for all the cultural achievements of the past? In the face of such hostility (always implicit in the theory and practice of the Proletkult) its spokesmen tried to safeguard certain works of a transcendant humanity, and . "science" and "philosophy" as well, not to mention the Russian classics. How was this to be reconciled with the oft-repeated slogan about the proletarian culture arising strictly out of the proletarian womb? No doubt, one finds in these documents much hope, much bold thinking, yet also much utopianism, intellectual confusion, and a reckless disregard of hard realities. The extravagance was perhaps most clearly manifested in the design of a monument- headquarters for the Third International, which was to rise in the form of a large glass cube topped by a glass pyramid topped in turn by a glass cylinder, each revolv- ing around itself, all within a complex steel scaffold of an ascending spiral. It was also reflected in the principles of progressive education carried to an extreme. Yet while smiling or scoffing one cannot but sympathize with the hopes and visions shown in these documents. Their goal still beckons: an industrial society harmonized in every respect with the spontaneous volition and self-realization of its individual members. It deserved better conditions than those of Russia in her years of deepest poverty and humiliation. One might dispute the editor's conclusion that it was NËP that killed the Proletkult. One might rather say that the deed was done long before, by Lenin - or by objective necessity. When in 1903 Lenin had observed that, left to its own devices, the working class would produce only a trade union consciousness, he had turned his back against the cultural creativity of the proletariat as a progressive force. When in March 1918 he argued that the German workers were superior to Russian workers and began to preach industrial discipline, he undercut the theory and practice of the Proletkult at the very root. Under the conditions of backwardness, in short, the spontaneous creativity of the working class offers no hope for building a superior society. And yet, how can there arise a viable culture or polity without their active contri- bution? Theodore H. Von Laue, Clark University, Worcester, Mass.</page></plain_text>
