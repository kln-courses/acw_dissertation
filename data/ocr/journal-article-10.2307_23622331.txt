Introduction This paper presents an overview of Indigenous maritime rock art studies in Western Australia and indicates possible future developments. In doing so it builds on from two earlier works on the subject. The first of these is the 1998 Contact Shipwreck Program, initiated through a study entitled Strangers on the Shore,1 while the second, produced in 2006 and filed as a departmental report under the Aboriginal Watercraft Depictions Program, is a catalogue of Western Australian Indigenous maritime rock art.2 Emanating from and under the supervision of staff from the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Museum, both studies (initiated and supervised by M. McCarthy) were undertaken with an eye towards the Museum's brief to produce works of value to both an academic and public audience (as publications, in hard copy and electronic catalogues as well as databases).3 These initiatives have created a strong dynamic by extending the corpus of known maritime depictions in Western Australia and they serve to generate and define a more comprehensive and theoretically-aware view of Indigenous maritime rock art. Adding to these developments is the extensive and constantly expanding Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales assemblage of maritime depictions. Together, 16</page><page sequence="2">The Great Circle Overviews And Developments Vol. 35, No. 2, this material allows for the commencement of a national study program and the papers in this volume represent a first step in that direction. With the objective of continuing the research synergy created by the above mentioned studies, this paper focuses first on presenting an overview of previous iconic sites and studies of Indigenous maritime rock art in Western Australia (such as Walga Rock, Inthanoona, the Kimberley and elsewhere). Secondly, it provides a brief introduction to recent research and new discoveries. It also explores possible future developments in the realm of Indigenous maritime rock art in Western Australia. In the context of this particular study, the term Indigenous maritime rock art relates to all types of graphical representations (paintings and petroglyphs) of watercraft and/or vessels (of Indigenous as well as non-Indigenous origin) depicted by Indigenous Australian artists. Western Australian Museum research programs The inspiration for the study entitled ' Strangers on the shore: Shipwreck survivors and their contact with Aboriginal groups in Western Australia 1628-1956' (conducted in 1998 by Lesley Silvester)4 came from the Museum's series of multi-disciplinary researches into the ramifications of a landing by survivors from the VOC ship Zuytdorp (1712) and the Croatian barque Stefano (1875).5 It was designed to list the 51 instances of possible and verified social contact occurrences between shipwreck survivors (Europeans or Macassans) and Indigenous Australians. Part of that study also focused on the identification of contact rock art that could be linked with a particular vessel or shipwreck incident. Following this research initiative and involving a similar dynamic, in 2006 the first preliminary catalogue of Aboriginal depictions of watercraft from Western Australia was undertaken by the author.6 The geographical spread of the watercraft depictions studied in 2006 shows firstly that the greatest concentration is located across the Kimberley region, another small cluster can be found at the now abandoned Inthanoona Station in the Pilbara region, inland of the regional and pearling port of Cossack, and finally isolated examples occur at Walga Rock (in the vicinity of Cue) and Marlbeerup near the Mount Ridley (north east of Esperance). A total of 25 Indigenous depictions (paintings and engravings) were described. 17</page><page sequence="3">The Great Circle Nicolas Bigourdan Vol. 35, No. 2, This study also expanded into a theoretical framework as a result of an initial attempt at a 'predictive modeling for the survival potential of underwater [rock art] depictions', identifying 'because of its relative small size and morphology, Depuch Island ... as an ideal Western Australian location to implement further research into submerged rock art' ,7 As is the situation on dry land today, images were predicted to exist in places identified by scholars such as Rosenfeld in a work entitled 'Rock Art conservation in Australia' on domed roofs or vertical faces of enclosed rock shelters as well as on the horizontal side of granophyre rocks in open areas or cliffs.8 On another level it was observed in the 2006 study that rock art as 'pictorially represented visions of ancestors, events, encounters and environments was and still remains a means of communication and a record of past events' for Indigenous Australian communities.9 The use of additive (paintings, drawings, stencils) or extractive (pecking, pounding, scratching) techniques as defined by scholars such as Maynard examining rock art 'classification and terminology',10 were particularly examined and compared in terms of survival. The depictions of watercraft or vessels in Western Australia presented in this present study are also linked to themes of Indigenous social history such as those appearing in a study of nautical themes in Aboriginal rock paintings from western Arnhem Land published earlier in this journal by Roberts." As such, they represent customary practices or mystical beliefs associated with the use of Indigenous watercraft as well as a testimony to the arrival of Macassan and Europeans vessels for exploration or hunting purposes. For Turner, who examined rock art on Bikerton Island, encounters between what were in effect 'strangers on the shore' and local Indigenous communities were in some instances illustrated as rock art depictions because, 'people seemed to have painted subjects immediate in their experience, and that the more unique these immediate experiences are the more chance they have of being depicted'.12 For Roberts, who examined art in Arnhem Land, rock art representations 'may depict specific, concrete encounters, and those experiences may have been personally new or unique in any number of ways, but the details and technical knowledge conveyed surely suggest the paintings were informed by general experience and understanding of nautical vessel and maritime industries'.13 18</page><page sequence="4">The Great Circle Overviews And Developments Vol. 35, No. 2, These observations, also noted by Burningham in his analysis of Macassans and the pearling industry appearing in Aboriginal nautical art,14 then by Chaloupka on the subject of their praus as recorded in Arnhem land,15 relate to the now well-accepted awareness that the degree of detail and the recognizable elements present in the depictions reflects the degree of interaction between the watercraft and the artist. Most recently, in examining Indigenous depictions of a wide variety of non-Indigenous vessels (steamships, luggers, praus), Wesley, McKinnon and Raupp used an analysis of rock art in north-west Arnhem land to develop an analytical matrix that could be used to quantify this interaction between the artist and the art.16 These various approaches are relevant to the Western Australian instances and all could be applied as the study of Indigenous maritime rock art progresses. Studies in the Kimberley region Within Western Australia, the Kimberley region has the largest number of known rock art representations of watercraft. In the 2006 Western Australian catalogue of Indigenous depictions of watercraft17 the Kimberley region accounts for 15 out of 25, or 60% of this type of known representations in Western Australia. O'Connor and Arrow18 state that one of these has been identified as a possible Macassan prau, also discussed by Crawford in his seminal Art of the Wanjina,19 four as European watercraft and ten as canoes or dugouts of Indigenous origin or acquired from the Macassans.20 Most of these depictions are represented with anthropomorphic figures on board, some being identified as 'Bradshaw figures' or Gwion Gwion21 and others associated with Wandjina style paintings, again as described by Crawford in a later work.22 If correct, these stylistic considerations offer relative chronological associations.23 In 2006, during a prospective fieldwork session on the mainland coast near the Montgomery Islands (North Kimberley), O'Connor and Arrow identified three unrecorded rock art paintings of European style sailing boats.24 Interpreted from the details and characteristics observed as a schooner, a ketch rigged vessel and a simple dinghy sail rig, they all show technical and social elements as well as features indicating a possible implication or link to the pearling industry,25 indicating once again a degree of social and operational familiarization. O'Connor 19</page><page sequence="5">The Great Circle Nicolas Bigourdan Vol. 35, No. 2, and Arrow then challenge the definition of 'contact art' by recalling that according to Clarke and Frederick in their examination of 'cross cultural engagements' through rock art,26 the notion of 'contact' refers to an 'unfamiliar encounter', while European vessels 'would have been a common sight along this coast'.27 Hence, such depictions may be more a representation of a personal narrative after contact than distant observations at the point of contact.28 Despite listing several instances of rock art depictions from Western Australia showing watercraft or boats, such as paintings located on the Mitchell Plateau or Bigge Island in the Kimberley, past researchers have been unable to identify particular vessesls. The only examples of rock art depictions of introduced watercraft where a strong link to a known vessel can be made is in the Pilbara region to the south of the Kimberley. Studies in the Pilbara Region Walga Rock One of the best-known and most-studied ship depictions appears at Walga Rock, about 50km southwest of Cue and approximately 325km from the Western Australian coast (in the vicinity of the Sanford River's head, tributary of the Murchison River). Walga Rock is the second largest monolith of Australia and has a vast gallery of Indigenous rock art. Speculations about the subject of the depiction, its authorship and the period of its manufacture have been numerous since the first recorded sightings of the paintings in the mid 1920's. There are also endless theories,29 with most listed in K.M. Sale's work Walga Rock Site History, conducted as part of an Indigenous Cultural Heritage Protection Program study.30 Transcribed into a section of the Walga Rock visitor's book, Sale's work provides a chronology of visitation, together with the theories ascribed to visitors with supporting references. It also lists many Indigenous accounts of the origin of the painting. While a number of both Indigenous and European accounts attribute the painting to survivors of either the Batavia (1629) or the Zuytdorp (1711), both of which are known to have landed near the Murchison River, the strongest and most potently argued theory now links the Walga Rock ship painting to the steamer SSXantho (1872). Once it was ascertained that gun ports, such as those apparently depicted along the 20</page><page sequence="6">The Great Circle Overviews And Developments Vol. 35, No. 2, hull of the Walga Rock ship, were a common decorative feature of late 19th century and early 20th century iron and steel hulled vessels, the case most often argued that the Walga Rock image was of a three-masted 17th or 18th century Dutch East India ship such as the Batavia and the Zuytdorp collapsed. The Walga rock image is clearly a two-masted steamer, and not a partially dismasted Dutch East Indiaman as often claimed. Furthermore, the VOC vessels carried 'lateen' type mizzen sails while the Walga Rock image shows a vessel with a mizzen sail of the form common in the colonial era, a time when lateen sails appeared only in an Arabic context. In addition, extensive research conducted by noted mid-west historian Stan Gratte indicates that this rock art depiction appears to have been produced around 1917 and could be attributed to Sammy 'Malay' (or Sammy Hassan).31 His theory, supported by the travels of this individual who came from Shark Bay (where he occupied the place known as Sammy Well on the north east end of Dirk Hartog Island) to settle in the Murchison goldfields with a group of local Indigenous people, relates to the period of indentured labourers in this region for the pearling industry during which divers from present day Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and Timor were generally but incorrectly referred to as 'Malays'. Numbers of them were employed on board the SSXantho and 140 of them were transported on that ship from Batavia to the northwest of Australia. Some were abandoned by Charles Broadhurst, owner of the SS Xantho in Geraldton after it sank near the Murchison River and others later at Shark Bay after the downturn of the pearling industry in the late 1870's. Inthanoona The rock art at the now-abandoned Inthanoona station provides the largest corpus of Indigenous contact and historical rock engravings, shedding some light on cross-cultural activities during the second half of the 19th century. Paterson and Wilson have examined this assemblage in their study of 'Indigenous perceptions of contact'.32 From the beginning of the colonization of the northwest, settlers either brought Indigenous Australians from other locations with them or used the regional population to work on and develop the pastoral stations and/or to be involved as forced labour to work as divers to 21</page><page sequence="7">The Great Circle Nicolas Bigourdan Vol.35, No. 2, collect shells for the pearling industry.33 As presented and explained by Paterson and Wilson.34 it seems clear that historical records show how 'the colonial world of the Northwest was one that involved interaction between settlers and Aboriginal people, a demand for Indigenous work and services, the forced movement of people from the hinterland to the coastal pearling activities, and statutes that provided access to cheap Aboriginal labour with minimal regulation or protection'. The head of Inthanoona pastoral station is located 30km from the closest coastline and 70km from the port of Cossack (first port of the northwest), along a large waterhole in the Jones River, and overlooked by stone outcrops where a large rock engraving assemblage is concentrated.35 Samuel Viveash first leased the station in 1865, being the owner of the pearling cutter Amateur™ Initially reported by David Daniels and further re-examined by Reynolds,37 this site of engravings appeared as one of the richest sites of the region in terms of contact era images with at least 55.38 Located on boulders of a granophyre knoll at the southeastern extent of the site, seven depictions of ships illustrate a post-contact rock art practice with roots in an ancient figurative and geometric rock engraving tradition of the Pilbara.39 These engravings suggest the close relationship of the Inthanoona station with the pearling industry, with details affirming a personal acquaintance and practice of vessels engaged in that industry and in the carrying of passengers and goods to and from Cossack, the port for both the pearlers and for the town of Roebourne. While there is some conjecture about the identity of some of the two and three masted sailing vessels, Paterson and Wilson agree with Reynolds' 1987 assertion that because of the presence of funnels and masts on three of the ship engravings of Inthanoona and the consistent occupation period of the site together with its early involvement in the pearling industry, these depictions might well-represent the SS Xantho. While McCarthy has provided evidence in support of this theory,40 as acknowledged by these scholars, there is more work to be done (and see Paterson and Van Duivenvoorde in this volume). The Inthanoona engravings are documents of the Indigenous reactions to and perceptions of the arrival of European settlers in general at the Inthanoona site because, as Paterson and Wilson suggest quoting Frederick in a central Australian study,41 'rock art does not merely reflect 22</page><page sequence="8">The Great Circle Overviews And Developments Vol. 35, No. 2, a series of historical events and the imposition of foreign forces, rather it represents a more complex exchange involving losses and gains'. Recent and Future Developments During the last two to three years a new wave of unexpected discoveries, research initiatives and opportunities has appeared, developing larger interest and synergy around the study of Indigenous rock art depictions of watercraft within Western Australia. Burnabinmah Station One of the latest finding to have been reported to the attention of the Maritime Archaeology Department of the Western Australian Museum (MADWAM) was by G. and H. McLean (the former a Visitor Services Officer at the Western Australian Museum and the latter a Department of Environment and Conservation volunteer) on the 3rd of September 2012. On a visit in the area north west of Payne Find, the manager of the Burnabinmah Station (50km south west of Mount Magnet) showed them a rock shelter on a cliff facing the station homestead where the outline of an engraved ship can be found (Figure 1). At first glance a hull seems visible (with possible bulkheads), as well as masts (potentially showing two sails with a small jib at the front and a larger main sail) and at one end of the depiction there is a feature that could be identified as an anchor (possibly of Admiralty pattern, conferring a possible minimal date around the mid-19th Century). The general nature of this depiction has been confirmed as a ship rigged vessel by other specialists, including Michael McCarthy, Peter Veth and Ross Anderson (pers. comms September 2012). Assisted by Jennifer McKinnon (Flinders University), DStretch software42 was used to help the interpretation by highlighting the contours and lines of the depiction. However, further analysis, interpretation and recording is necessary to ensure a more detailed understanding of the depiction. South Coast There is one confirmed ship depiction and another possible ship depiction in the Esperance area of the South Coast. A rock painting of a ship is located at the Marbaleerup (Mount Ridley) site complex 130km inland from Esperance. The ship is interpreted as a two-masted sailing vessel with shrouds, and was included in the author's 2006 23</page><page sequence="9">The Great Circle Nicolas Bigourdan Vol. 35, No. 2, catalogue. This site was subjected to vandalism in early 2013, however the depiction has fortunately survived (R. Reynolds pers. comm. 2013). I &amp;! Figure 1: The Bumabinmah ship engraving. A second rock painting described as a 'sailing ship' (G. Selby Yorkshire to R. Anderson, pers. comm. Nov. 2012) is depicted alongside hand stencils in red ochre, located within the Boyatup rock shelter 30km inland and 110km east of Esperance in the vicinity of Cape Arid. Further research is currently being carried out into the Marbaleerup and Boyatup sites, to investigate the possibility of these depictions representing contact between Aboriginal people and 19th century sealers and whalers active in the area (R. Reynolds to R. Anderson, R., pers. comm. 10/9/13). Kimberley A recent study has been initiated on the Mimbi site located 300km east from Derby and about 75 kilometres east of Fitzroy Crossing in the South Kimberley. The site has a variety of Indigenous rock art depictions, among which appears a ship image not included in the 2006 catalogue but which was reported by Phillip Playford in Donadson and Kinneally's 'Rock Art of the Kimberley' published in 2007.43 Appearing amongst images of port related activities and harbour infrastructure, the Mimbi images suggest an illustration of the late 19th century Indigenous 24</page><page sequence="10">The Great Circle Overviews And Developments Vol. 35, No. 2, involvement in the loading of cattle from the pastoral station onto the ships. The research is investigating the origin and reason a maritime rock art depiction is present so far inland. A publication by Jane Balme and Sue O'Connor is in preparation. Present within this special edition of The Great Circle are the results of a three year archaeological project conducted by June Ross on several rock art ship depictions from the Kimberley.44 The study analyses depictions of numerous new images together with others well known from the North Kimberley in order to conduct comparative analysis and discussion. For this research, Ross worked closely with the local Wanambul Gaambera people at Kalumburu, receiving very valuable input again highlighting the need for Indigenous involvement in rock art research. Future Recent developments nationally and in the Northern Territory have created strong research opportunities within the realm of maritime rock art studies in Western Australia. For instance, the Picturing Change research program (see introduction) has thrown new light on contact period rock art, especially in regards to ships.45 This research compliments that of Daryl Wesley (The Australian National University) at the Wellington Range, northwestern Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Wesley and his team established the basis of a maritime rock art interpretive tool by providing 'a comprehensive analytical framework that can be tested and reproduced'.46 Even if this framework is addressed primarily to rock art depictions of non-Indigenous watercraft, it contributes to our understanding and interpretation, and provides a systematic inter-disciplinary approach for this category of Indigenous Australian rock art representations. The principle is to study 'the presence and absence of elements and features that were included in the watercraft motif.'47 The objective is that 'future researchers can use and develop ... [the framework]... further to begin piecing together the larger issues and considerations represented in ... watercraft depictions' ,48 This is particularly useful in a Western Australian context for all types of representations. The recent establishment of the Centre for Rock Art Research + Management (CRAR+M) at the University of Western Australia will also be useful as its focus on the rock art 25</page><page sequence="11">The Great Circle Nicolas Bigourdan Vol. 35, No. 2, of Western Australia should lead to both new discoveries and new interpretations. Conclusion This paper has achieved two principal objectives, firstly to present an overview or state of the art of research on Indigenous maritime rock art in Western Australia and, secondly, to discuss the recent and future developments within this same domain. Important avenues of research to be implemented in the Western Australian context would be the elaboration of an analytical framework to help the interpretation of watercraft depictions and the development of a strict and operationally oriented research agenda to test predictive models for the localization of submerged rock art depictions. Obviously, a better understanding of the social, historical, environmental and contact related context of the creation of each representation involving a series of activities, interactions and choices, ranging from the technical to the performance,49 are crucial elements to consider within future research projects on rock art depictions of watercraft.
