<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gandhara, Rome and Mathura: The Early Relief Style Benjamin Rowland Harvard University, Cambridge On a gold coin of the Emperor Huvishka the City Goddess of Rome symbolically proclaims the Kushan Empire's admiration for the Roman world,1 as though con firming what Rutilius Namatianus implied when he wrote, as late as the fifth century, that Rome "made a city of what was once a world/' . . . "Your works," he proclaimed, "spread wide as the rays of the sun where curving ocean surrounds the world."2 The influence of Rome on the culture of the East was never in any sense a spiritual or philosophical one. Rome never completely taught the oriental nations how to be Romans nor profoundly affected their religions. Roman ideas, however, did find their way through and around the Parthian Iron Curtain which for centuries separated India from the Medi terranean world. This was a material penetration in the shape of export of goods and, there is reason to believe, export of artisans who for a number of centuries lent an entirely Classical face to art under the Kushans and thereby to Central Asian art as well. Rome never aspired to the Alexandrian dream of unity of East and West, and yet the conquest of regions out of her military and political control was, if anything, more enduring than that of Alexander's successors. The Roman commercial and artistic conquest of realms beyond her frontiers is the story of the development of the art of Gandhara. As I have demonstrated elsewhere in consid ering the survival of the Hellenistic tradition in northwest India, there is reason to believe that the pale reflection of Greek art that we descry in the early sculpture of Sirkap (Taxila) was in reality an adaptation of Augustan art, following as a natural result of the establishment of com mercial relations between the first Kushan Dy nasty and the Roman Empire.3 This is a depen dence not limited to the Kushan imitation of Roman coinage and the borrowing of Roman styles revealed in the earliest sculpture of Taxila, but one that extends to the introduction of dis tinctly Roman techniques of relief sculpture as well. The absence of an entirely reliable chronol ogy for Gandh?ra sculpture has in a way forced the study of this development into a separate analysis of the many elements of foreign, specif ically Roman, elements that combine to produce this easternmost reflection of Late Antique art. The examination of yet one more of these deriva tions in the field of relief sculpture may serve to clarify the inception and growth of its style. Insofar as it is possible to be didactic about such matters there appear to be three distinct styles of Roman relief represented in Gandh?ra carving: in the first type the figures are isolated against a blank background, as in the style of fifth-century Greece and its revivals in Rome; a second manner arranges the figures in inter related groups with a suggestion of depth through overlapping and the turning of the forms in space; a third style represents a further development of the second technique with the forms moving in a deep spatial ambient. The first of these corresponds to a manner found in Rome in the first century in the decades of Fla vian and Trajanic rule; the second is character istic of the Hadrianic epoch; and the third man ner is the formula developed in the time of the Antonines and Severids. There is, of course, no way of determining if these successive styles of sculpture in Rome itself were introduced to Gandh?ra one by one. Since much later techniques, both Roman and provin cial Roman, found their way to India in the 8</page><page sequence="2">course of the second and third centuries A.D., it seems likely that the relief styles used in Rome in the Flavian and Hadrianic periods appeared in the late first and early second centuries, and that the more complicated spatial style typical of the Antonines was brought to the Kushan realm by journeymen craftsmen at a later moment. Notable illustrations of the first style are a group of reliefs in Pakistan and the West. The fragments in question were originally designed as stair-risers, and all of them were carved in the fine grained soapstone invariably found in the best Gandh?ra specimens. They are all approxi mately 17 by 6 inches in dimension. A group of three panels is in the Cleveland Museum (Fig. 1); one is in the author's collection (Fig. 2), and another in the Wadsworth Athenaeum at Hartford (Fig. 3). All these are reputed to have come from the Buner region.4 The marvelous collection of Gandh?ra reliefs in the Guides' Mess at Hoti Mardan included still another re lated piece (Fig. 4). Two more of the series are in the Peshawar Museum, and another in the National Museum, Karachi (Fig. 5).5 In all of these examples the figures are separated from one another and isolated against a blank back ground in a manner totally different from the usual Gandh?ra relief technique that appears to be an adaptation of the deeply cut illusionistic mode of Roman relief. It is readily apparent, too, that this style has nothing to do with the gen eral development in the sculptural tradition of India proper, in which the forms emerge like bosses from the surface of the stone with a com pletely ambiguous relationship of planes. The origins of the style represented by the group of Gandh?ra reliefs under consideration are to be found in the Roman relief technique of the first century A.D., notably the frieze of the Arch of Titus and the Forum of Nerva.6 Like so much of early Roman Imperial art, this technique is a syncretic adaptation of the Greek style of the great period. The theme of these panels could be described as festal or bacchanalian in character, compris ing drinking scenes and panels given over to dancing figures and musicians. Possibly the whole set is a representation of the celebrations attending the marriage of the Bodhisattva. How ever, the exact subject matter of the whole col lection of reliefs is not entirely clear. I am now inclined to discard the identification of the relief publshed in The Art and Architecture of India as "The Presentation of the Bride to Siddhartha" (Fig. 2), since it differs markedly from the scenes usually identified as the betrothal, so that the actual wedding scene is missing from this set of panels.7 All of the reliefs in the present set, which we may call the "Buner Series," con sist of six figures: a confronted pair in the center with balancing groups of two figures to right and left. In the panel in the author's collection (Fig. 2) the personages are arranged in easy con versational attitudes, some drinking out of gob lets and bowls, others holding palm leaf fans. In the Hartford panel the figures hold enormous lotus buds. Similar offerings are presented by the groups in the Peshawar Museum. The scenes in Cleveland are given over to music, dancing, and bibulous activities. All, in other words, are dedi cated to rather decorous celebration, so that col lectively the group might be intended to repre sent the bringing of tributes and the festal par ticipation of various peoples at the marriage of the Bodhisattva or they may be intended to por tray donors of different races and classes. The distinct differences in types and costumes almost suggest the sculptor was portraying separate national groups, clans, or guilds gathering to celebrate the great event or as various types of people paying tribute to Buddha in general. One is almost reminded of the differentiated national groups of the Achaemenid reliefs at Persepolis or their Sasanian descendants, the friezes of tribute bearing Romans on Sh?pur's relief at Bishapur.8 Other Gandh?ra panels of boatmen or, as they are sometimes called, Marine Deities (Fig. 6) that perhaps formed part of the series would be representatives of still another profession honor ing the wedding of Siddhartha or appearing simply as donors honoring the Buddha.9 It seems highly likely that the bacchanalian scenes in vari 9</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1.

It is a style asso ciated with Rome and Italy particularly under the Flavian emperors and through the reign of Trajan (98-117 A.D.). Its appearance in India furnishes a tempting piece of evidence for a possible direct connection between Gandh?ra and Rome in this formative period. The very refinement of the carving of these, the best ex amples of Gandh?ra sculpture, suggests the early date and a direct link with Roman craftsman ship. The draped female figures on the frieze at Mardan and on my relief have their nearest equivalent in the carvings of women on the re liefs of the Forum of Nerva (96-98 A.D.) (Fig. 7) i11 not only the disposition of the costume, but also the incised, linealized technique of the drapery itself, appears very close; the pose itself is an ultimate reworking of the Praxitelean d?hanchement. The actual arrangement of the figures, against a plain background and related to one another by their poses and lateral gestures, is again a close prototype for the composition of the Buner panels. This is a manner that antedates the Hadrianic style of relief, so admirably analyzed by Soper in his notable essay on Gandh?ra and Roman art.12 If the Hadrianic formula reached the Kushan realm ca. 125-150 A.D., it had already been anticipated by this Augustan-Flavian style, probably in the last quarter of the first cen tury A.D. Another Roman work which these reliefs re semble very closely in composition is the silver hoop representing the Olympians, in the Museo di Antichit? at Turin (Fig. 8) .13 The placing of the figures, spaced at intervals against a plain background and arranged as though in easy con versational attitudes, is exactly what we find in the stair-risers from Buner; it anticipates the more complex grouping of figures in historical scenes in reliefs of the Hadriantic period. In smaller scale the Turin silver plaque reproduces the style of dedicatory reliefs associated with Augustus's reign that continued to the end of the first century A.D.14 Presumably the silver fascia from the Treasure of Marengo dates from the time of Lucius Verus (161-169 A.D.) and perpetuates the Flavian style. Although the employment of the Flavian Trajanic mode is not necessarily a certain index to the early date of the Buner reliefs, other bits of evidence point to the possibility of their hav ing been executed as early as the first century A.D. In the relief at Mardan related to this series (Fig. 4), some of the figures are represented drinking from a distinctive type of goblet with a carinated and fluted body on a narrow foot (Fig. 9). A damaged representation of this same type of vessel may be seen in the relief in the writer's collection. Actual silver cups of the same shape were found long ago at Taxila, to gether with a silver askos, with an inscription dated in the year 191.15 If we follow Lohuizen de Leeuw's dating of this object, the "Jihonika vase," in 62 A.D., then the goblets associated with it must have been made at the same time, about 40 A.D.16 It would therefore be entirely logical that this style of vessel should appear in reliefs carved in the period from 75 to 100 A.D. Again, the drapery of some of the personages in the Buner reliefs reveals a close relationship to the more Classical of the Gandh?ra Buddhas, notably the remarkable standing figures for merly in the Guides' Mess at Hoti Mardan (Fig. 10). This is not surprising since at least one of the reliefs?the bacchanalian frieze at Mardan ?perhaps formed part of the collection and pre sumably came from the same find spot. The drapery, both in the small figures such as Fig ure 5 and the Buddha statue, gives an impression of heaviness and volume. The robe is conceived as distinctly separate from the form which it covers, although completely revealing the con tours and fullness of the body. Both belong to a period that was marked by the closest relation ship between Indian and Roman styles. Like the style of the reliefs, the drapery of the Mardan 12</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 7.

Bronze Portrait Statue from Herculaneum National Museum, Naples Buddhas is a reflection or reworking of the man ner of the Augustan period, as seen in such standing figures as the draped Augustus of the Via Labicana and, as Buchthal has pointed out, in the Rhenish derivation from this style, illus trated by a togaed statue from Ingelheim.17 Buchthal arrives at the conclusion that the re lated Gandh?ra figures are therefore to be dated at the earliest in the second half of the first cen tury A.D.18 Actually, the style of drapery in these Buddha images?and, thereby, the relief figures, too?resembles even more closely the manneristic transformation of the Augustan formula in the second and third quarters of the first century A.D. In the bronze portrait statues of women from Herculaneum, dating from the period of Caligula (37-41 A.D.) and Claudius (41-54 A.D.) (Fig. II),19 the drapery is ar ranged in long, unbroken, undulating folds that make a decorative organization independent of volume and form. The body tends to disappear behind this curtain-like drapery, and the figure is presented in a distinctly frontal point of view. The right knee, cut like a sharply projecting block, is prominently emphasized under the drapery. It is precisely this kind of abstract man nerism in drapery that finds its way into the Gandh?ra reliefs and statues of a period that can therefore be only slightly later in date.2u A further confirmation for dating the Buner reliefs shortly before 100 A.D. may be found in the resemblance between some of the draped figures in the drinking scenes at Mardan and in my collection and a Nike-like statue unearthed by Sir John Marshall in the Dharmarajika area (Dh. 1914-314) .21 Sir John assigns this figure to the transitional period between Parthian and Kushan domination of Taxila, presumably in the third quarter of the first century A.D.22 It will be noted that both the type of costume and its treatment in a somewhat stylized linear rework ing of the Hellenistic formula correspond very closely to the style of the figures on the stair risers. The more Classical members of these reliefs, together with the Buddha figures of the Mardan type, seem to form a stylistic group which rep resents the closest and earliest approach to Roman standards of carving. Since the relation ship is with Roman reliefs and draped figures of the latter half of the first century, a dating fur ther supported, as we have seen, by the type of goblets depicted in the relief at Mardan, these Gandh?ra carvings are therefore the immediate successors in date and style to the late Hellen istic-Augustan school represented by the sculp ture of the Part?an period at Taxila. This type of relief is by the same token earlier than the Hadri anic style mentioned by Soper and the even later Gandh?ra imitations of the illusionistic Roman styles of the second and third centuries. There is no need to dwell in detail here on the history of commercial and diplomatic relations between India and the Roman world. It suffices to repeat that, although trade with India cer tainly was transacted even in the days of Augus 14</page><page sequence="8">W!f??3&amp;|&amp; Fig. 12. Details of Torana Crossbars Mat hura Reliefs Curzon Museum of Archaeology, Muttra tus, the real period of florescence for commercial relations between Rome and southern, as well as northern, India began with the discovery of the monsoon winds under Claudius (41-54 A.D.) The greatest intimacy in these connections was reached with Trajan's campaigns in the East and the visits of Indian, Bactrian, and Kushan em bassies to him and to the court of Hadrian.23 This is the time, too, when quantities of Roman art objects recovered at Taxila and Begram were exported from the Mediterranean to the Kushan domains.24 Further indications of the closeness of con tacts between Rome and India are Kanishka's assumption of the title Caesar in the Ara in scription and the use of Roman months in the Wardak inscription and elsewhere.20 It is in this period beginning in the mid-first century A.D. that we can expect a corresponding influence of Roman art, brought about, as has been suggested above, by the advent of Roman workmen in the Kushan Empire. The Buner reliefs mark the be ginning of this most Classical phase of Indian art, since some of them may well be the work of foreign sculptors.26 A further examination will bring out still other interesting factors relating to the develop ment of Gandh?ra sculpture. In the first place, the panels certainly show a variety of hands at work. One of these collaborators has such a very Classical touch that one could suppose that he was a Roman journeyman sculptor: this hand is revealed in the relief in the author's collection, in the group in Cleveland, and the panels of boat men or Marine Deities. Other panels, notably the examples in Hartford and the National Mu seum, Karachi (Figs. 3, 5), just as unmistakably suggest the more Indian technique of craftsmen from Mathur?. Poses, costumes, and proportions of the figures all suggest the Mathur? style, as does the rather inorganic treatment of the anatomy, together with the pronounced linear style of the drapery. A final convincing link with the Mathur? group is the convention of a nimbus-like scarf placed behind the shoulders of some of the figures.27 All of these characteristics of the Mathur? man ner are present in a group of torana architraves in the Curzon Museum at Muttra (Fig. 12).28 These reliefs, like the Buner stair-risers, contain 1J</page><page sequence="9">a long line of figures isolated against a blank background. They are generally dated in the late first or early second century A.D.,29 although Mrs. Lohuizen-de Leeuw places them in the first century B.C.30 in what she describes as a transi tional period of development from symbols to anthropomorphic representation. The isolated arrangement of the figures in these Kushan re liefs, unusual for Indian workmanship, may itself be a borrowing from the Roman compo sition of the Buner group, which, if this assump tion is correct, would be even earlier than their Mathur? counterparts.31 What role the sculptors of Mathur??that is, the native sculptors working in north and north west India under the Kushans?played in the development of the Gandh?ra School is surely a question of primary importance in analyzing the character of the style. In earlier investigations of Gandh?ra art I have promulgated the theory that the whole Graeco-Buddhist or Romano Buddhist style began with Gandh?ra "primi tives," carvings marked by the employment of Indian forms with only a slight overlay of Clas sical technique.32 As mentioned above, the work manship of some of the panels in the present Buner series appears to indicate the participation of Mathur? artists. It seems apparent from this that, in the beginning, Gandh?ra sculpture was often a co-operative enterprise by both native and foreign craftsmen, a collaboration, in which the over-all conception of the work was domi nated by Roman ideas; in the Buner reliefs, for example, the individual scenes in both Indian and Roman style are all framed by engaged Corinthian columns, and the individual details of drapery like the archaistic swallow-tail con vention in some of the figures in the more Indian examples show an unmistakable borrowing from Classical formulae. In addition to the many sepa rate reasons already mentioned for dating these works around the end of the first century A.D., the very combination of distinct and separate Indian and Roman technique suggests that the work was done in the early decades of the School, because thereafter, presumably through most of the second century A.D., Gandh?ra sculpture assumed an almost completely Classical character modeled on prototypes of the Hadri anic and Antonine periods in Rome. 16 NOTES 1.

Pope (ed.), A Survey of Persian Art, IV, New York and London, 1938, PI. 90-94, 158. The differences in the costumes of the people of the reliefs in the series is so marked that one is almost forced to assume that the sculptor made a deliberate attempt to portray the inhabitants of various regions in characteristic dress. In Fig. 2, for example, the style of dress is "Graeco-Roman" : the male figures are clad in short tunics; their female companions wear chiton and peplum; and, at the extreme right, is a person clothed in a pallium. The panels now in Hartford and Karachi (Figs. 3, 5) contain groups in what may be the dress of Gandh?ra: the men are outfitted with turbans and dhotis not unlike the costume of the Gandh?ra Bodhisattvas, and the female figures, in heavy skirts and nude above the waist, appear to display an Indian fashion. One of the panels in Cleveland (Fig. 1) shows a group of men in Iranian or Scythian dress with pointed caps, long belted jackets, and baggy trousers. 9. Cf. Foucher, I, Fig, 126. The panels of boatmen in the British Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art are nearly identical in material and size with the rest of the Buner stair risers and must have formed part of the same scheme of deco ration. In each relief there are six muscle men clad in scal loped breech clouts and all, seemingly, striking a pose. All hold oars or paddles, and one in each group has a dolphin on his extended palm. The rather curious treatment of the muscles of the torso in protruding bosses appears as a mis understanding of the anatomy of some Hellenistic Herakles. The nearest Roman equivalent is a relief of Herakles and the Erymanthean Boar on the facade of St. Mark's, Venice. (Cf. E. Panofsky, Meaning in the Visual Arts, Doubleday Anchor Books, Garden City, N. Y., 1955, Fig. 5). The bronze Herakles from Nigrai in the British Museum stands as a pos sible intermediary between a Classical precedent and these reliefs. (Cf. Foucher, II, Fig. 476.) The poses, physical types, and rather pointed "foxy" faces are all close to the figures in other panels of the Buner series. 10. Foucher, I, Figs. 128, 132, etc. 11. Strong, Figs. 71 and 84, and P.

Soper (p. 310) complains: "In the field of the large isolated image I have found no standing statues to illustrate the first phase of Roman influence." As he states, the Loriyan-Tangai and Charsada Buddhas already reveal a degree of schemati zation of the Roman formula. Their obvious prototypes, in which the style approximates the Roman manner of the late first century, are the strongly Classic examples at Mardan. They must be at least a half-century earlier than these con troversial dated images. The same writer (p. 310) describes the Loriyan-Tangai and Charsada Buddhas as showing "an advance toward formality in the hang of their drapery folds. . . . They seem to represent ... a halfway stage toward the final schematization of the 'Udyana (sic) image' type, whose folds are symmetrical about a vertical axis from collar to hem." Whether we accept the Saka era of 150 B.C. proposed by Konow (JRAS, April, 1932), or Lohuizen-de Leeuw's reck oning from 129 B.C. (The Scythian Era, p. 65), the dates of the inscribed statues from Loriyan-Tangai and Charsada will fall in the later second and third centuries A.D.; and this is where they unquestionably belong from a stylistic point of view in relation to the Roman style proper. The sudden and intensive mass production, almost entirely the work of artisans imported from the Roman West, must have begun in the last quarter of the first century A.D. Probably, as Soper (p. 306) has suggested, there may have been further visits from Roman workmen in the early second century A.D. The images of Loriyan-Tangai and Charsada, dated 168 or 189 and 234 or 255 A.D., represent a later convention alization of this first style and, as I have described elsewhere, approximate the Antonine style in Rome ("Gandh?ra and Late Antique Art: The Buddha Image," AJA, XLVI, 1942, pp. 224 ff.). Between them and the earliest Gandh?ra carv ings are the reliefs in Hadrianic style described by Soper (p. 305 f.). Thereafter the evolution of the school and its types follows the progression towards a greater and greater conventionalization such as I have outlined in earlier articles on this subject. 21.

The active collaboration of Westerners in Indian art of the first century A.D. and later, symbolized by the legend of St. Thomas, who was sold as an architect to King Gondophares, is confirmed by the appearance of Greek names on Gandh?ra monuments?just as Greek workmen signed the works pro duced for Roman patrons at Aphrodisias (Cf. M. Squarcia pino, La Scuola di Afrodisia, Rome, 1943, pp. 24-47). These include the name of Kanishka's master-of-works, Agisela (A.S.I., A.R., 1908-09, pp. 52-53), the Menander of the relief of wrestlers in the Peshawar Museum (A.S.I., A.R., 1926-27, PL I, pp. 232-233), and Palamedes, architect of Surkh Kotal (R. Curiel, "Inscriptions de Surkh Kotal," Journal Asiatique, 1954, p. 195). Soper (p. 305) cites fur ther the mention of "Yavana" carpenters in Indian texts. 27. In the Buner panel from Hartford is a figure, second from the left, with a scarf billowing out behind the head. This motif, which also occurs in the examples in Pakistan, has a possible origin in the deities in the Terra Mater relief of the Ara Pacis: it has indeed a long history in even earlier Clas sical art and is a favorite device of sarcophagi sculptors of the Hadrianic period and later (Charles H. Morgan, "The Motive of a Figure holding in both hands a piece of drapery which blows out behind or over the figure," Art Studies, 6, Cambridge, 1928, pp. 163 ff.). This same fluttering shawl convention appears in the torana lintel from Mathura. 28. J. Ph. Vogel, La sculpture de Mathura, Ars Asi?tica, XV, Paris, 1930, PL VII. 29- L. Bachhofer (Early Indian Sculpture, PI. 104) dates these reliefs "previous to 129 A.D." These torana crossbars from Mathura can be dated with considerable accuracy by comparing them with related Indian reliefs. It is perfectly apparent, for example, that the style of the figures?rather heavy, squat in proportion, and still rather stiff in the articulation of body and limbs?is earlier than that of the donor images at Karli which may be dated ca. 120 A.D. (H. Zimmer, The Art of Indian Asia, Bollingen Series, N. Y., XXXIX, 1955, PL 82-83 and p. 224, n. 70). At the same time it is obvious that the style of the Mathura carvings is later than the Sanchi reliefs of the mid-first cen tury A.D. (Zimmer, p. 235), that a date of ca. 100 A.D. would be about right for these Kushan panels. 30. Lohuizen-de Leeuw, Fig. 35, pp. 155-7. 31. Vogel (p. 59) speaks of "l'influence grecque" in the carving of these panels. In A.S.I., A.R., 1909-10, p. 74, he refers to Graeco-Buddhist influence. 32. B.
