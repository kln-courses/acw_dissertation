<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POLITICS OF RENAISSANCE LITERATURE: A REVIEW ESSAY BY JONATHAN GOLDBERG Only the present generation of literary critics has viewed Renais- sance literature as a field for formal rather than historical, investi- gation. Before the second world war, things were exactly the oppo- site, and it was against the relentless historicising that passed as literary criticism that the new criticism was born. In a debate in the Sewanee Review over Marvell's "Horatian Ode," Cleanth Brooks faced Douglas Bush, defender of the faith, to define the terms that dominated literary criticism for the last generation, and defend the proper modern(ist) approach to Renaissance poems. The debate followed a challenge Brooks issued in his 1946 English Institute essay, declaring that poems had lives of their own and needed to be rescued from the grim literalism of historical critics who would chain poems to meanings ascertainable outside the text itself.L Poems were complex human statements, not hidebound re- positories of traditional truisms. In the years since this debate, an ironic reversal has occurred. Now the conservative keepers of the faith-and defenders of history-are the heirs of the new criticism, and the rabblerousers are the structuralists and their poststructural heirs. To further the irony, genuinely historical criticism takes one impulse from the structuralist assertion that everything is a text, while ahistoricism is waved by the diehards as their historical ban- ner. One sign of this can be seen in a recent review essay that William Empson wrote for the New York Review of Books (3 De- cember 1981). As famous as Bush's debate with Brooks was Rosemond Tuve's with Empson over the question of the originality of Herbert's imagery. Now, thirty years later, Empson locks arms with John Carey and, more significantly, Helen Gardner. But this is not, as it would first appear, a repeat of the old story, the aging knight of the new facing the dragon guarding the historical cave. Rather, Empson attacks Dame Helen's edition of Donne's poems-quite rightly, one must add-for historical inaccuracy. Ever the bad boy, Empson punctures the view of Donne's devel- opment from l'homme moyen sensuel to respectable gentleman, a 514 ELH Vol . 49 Pp. 51A4-542 0013-8304/8210492-514 $01.00 ? 1982 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">supposedly timeless and purportedly objective psychology that ig- nores Donne's specific historical situation and the function of poems in his society. History, for Gardner, is as timeless as texts were for Brooks. From such a view, history needs to be delivered and allowed the complexities that before inhered only in texts. A move in this direction can be seen in the career of one distin- guished critic of Renaissance literature, Stanley Fish.2 Fish began as a new critical mutant; true, everything that was interesting hap- pened in the reader, not in the text, and the text was far more open than any formalist would have allowed. Fish claimed for his reader what Brooks had for the text. But recently, he has repudiated his splendidly isolated reader making meaning. Rather, Fish's readers have joined the community of interpreters, and the meanings they make are bounded institutionally and historically by the rules and strategies allowed and accepted as true. This is, of course, to rob these institutions of the grand objectivity that Bush and Gardner claimed, but it is also to rob the reader of the autonomy of a textual status. Fish's move is a symptom of the times, a further indication of one turn being taken in the study of Renaissance literature these days, the return to historical criticism. It is the subject of this essay. In the pages that follow, I have divided these recent critics into three groups. First, the marxists, who avow the place of texts in material production. Second, a group less easily labelled (and far more successful), who regard textual and cultural production as interlaced activities. Finally, those critics who still cling to new critical assumptions about the text even as they claim to be restor- ing texts to their historical and political situations. I Frederic Jameson's The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act presents the only full scale attempt on this side of the Atlantic to argue for a marxist theory of textual produc- tion. Informed by the model of such continental theorists as Pierre Machery, Jameson focuses on the status of the text.3 Following Althusser, he asks, "is the text a free-floating object in its own right, or does it "reflect" some context or ground, and in that case does it simply replicate the latter ideologically, or does it possess some autonomous force in which it could also be seen as negating that context?" (38). The last position is Machery's-texts for him allow access to more than the replication of the culture's ideology-and to Jonathan Goldberg 515</page><page sequence="3">some extent Jameson's, although he is all too willing to allow liter- ary texts a status as mere reflections of cultural patterns, what he terms an allegorical or expressive relationship. Either way, crucial for Jameson is the embeddedness of the text in social structures, in history and politics; equally crucial is the extension of the struc- turalist term text to embrace this situation. Practically the last sen- tence in The Political Unconscious offers this redefinition of the structuralist- catchall -"When properly used, the concept of the text does not, as in garden-variety semiotic practice today, reduce these realities to small and manageable written documents of one kind or another, but rather liberates us from the empirical object-whether institution, event, or individual work-by displacing our attention to its constitution as an object and its relationship to the other objects thus constituted" (297). Jameson's italics highlight the fact that his position is Althusserian, and that, like Machery, the pro- duction of the text is also his concern: The text cannot be sheltered from history; this is where Jameson begins, holding up for scorn the new critics and their structuralist heirs, who in imagining for the text some realm of autonomy really lock it evermore into one of necessity. Ideology produces such clo- sure, pretending to account for all things and to place them forever; hence, the new critical isolation of the text succumbs to an ideological imperative that blinds the critic from the text's political situation. However, Jameson's marxism also serves as a blinder, and his belief that marxism is the truth leads to ideological closures and reductions too. For much as history must be respected, all texts must nonetheless be part of a single story, the only true narrative, the class struggle as it has manifested itself throughout history, and it is that "single vast unfinished plot" (20) that the text must not be sheltered from. Saying that, his position is in danger of distorting the texts it reads and the history it uncovers as the "'unconscious" and silence in texts. This is nowhere more evident than in a recent essay of his on Milton, which opens with this sentence: "Nothing is more appropriate, in the second year of the Iranian revolution and the first year of the Islamic Republic, than a return to 1642 and a meditation on the work of the greatest English political poet."4 Some might think nothing could be less appropriate, and perhaps it is to Jameson's credit that this initial flourish is soon muted. Reli- gion is politics, he means, then and now, but within two pages, he takes that back, making room (as he says) for the point "that religion in its strong form in precapitalist societies is functionally and sub- 516 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="4">stantively distinct from what it is today." By the end of the essay, Jameson's Islamic fantasy is attached to Milton's position on di- vorce: "is it ungrateful to suggest something Islamic in this con- ception of a democratic community of males who are free to re- pudiate their wives?" Ungrateful does not quite begin to describe this position. Jameson argues in "Religion and Ideology" that religion is "the master-code of precapitalistic society" and that it therefore ought to be accessible to a reading in which its major themes offer "'mysti- fied or distorted anticipations of secular and even scientific preoc- cupations which are ours today." Traduttore tradittore. Again, it may be to Jameson's credit that he can scarcely maintain his line of argument. In the course of his presentation, religion is called ideol- ogy, but then this is withdrawn, since "ideology is a modern term and a modern phenomenon." Milton's politics are exposed in his religion, but then it turns out that "Milton's poem is historical, even though .. . it fails to be political." (Yet, Milton is "the greatest English political poet"!) This curious statement receives an equally strange explanation: the poem is the product of a "&lt;post-political world," something it shares with our own times, Jameson says; post-1968 is post-1660. Since no period by Jameson's own admis- sion really could be "Cpost-political," it is difficult to know what he means, especially since Jameson wants to locate Milton's text in the context of Iran, and, at the same time, in the failed revolution of 1968. The only way any of that makes sense is if all revolutions are the same revolution. But if that were true, then history, which Jameson has been holding up ever since The Prison House of Lan- guage as the truth against which structuralism and modernism must quail, is a metaphysical notion, an idealist fantasy. Jameson practi- cally admits this, for defending himself against the possibility that history might be an optional code, one possible absence to which the text alludes, rather than its only ground, he insists that "History .. becomes the ultimate ground as well as the untranscendable limit of our understanding in general and our textual interpretations in particular" (100). In part because of such reductive tendencies, The Political Un- conscious articulates a systematic program for interpreting texts. Jameson offers what he calls three concentric frameworks for analysis. As a theoretical system these are suggestive enough to warrant summary, although they work to small effect in the Milton essay. In the first of these frames, inspired by Levi-Strauss, the text Jonathan Goldberg 517</page><page sequence="5">is a symbolic act, an ideological structure resolving contradictions that society fails to overcome. The critic must work to the real con- tradiction that the text fails to solve. Hence the Milton essay opens with a call for the "'rereading or rewriting" of Paradise Lost by "de- concealing" its political content. The same principle governs this frame of analysis, and is strikingly described as a critical program that joins structuralist and historical imperatives. The type of interpretation here proposed is more satisfactorily grasped as the rewriting of the literary text in such a way that the latter may itself be seen as the rewriting or restructuration of a prior historical or ideological subtext, it being always understood that that "subtext' is not immediately present as such, not some common-sense external reality, nor even the conventional narra- tives of history manuals, but rather must itself always be (re)- constructed after the fact. (81) As every schoolboy knows, some devils too, the crucial problem in Paradise Lost concerns those twins freedom and necessity, fate and freewill, which are also crucial to marxist analysis. In Jame- son s rewriting, one becomes the other. Jameson spends a number of pages in the essay arguing against the possibility that he will be accused of making marxism a religion, or turning Christian her- meneutics and providential history into marxism (he fights that fight in The Political Unconscious too). So, after growls in the di- rection of Norman Cohn, Lucien Goldmann and a condescending glance at Gide ("Consider for instance Gide's little fable, Laf- cadio's Adventures ... "), he proposes that Milton's solution, separating God's foreknowledge from predestination, "&lt;is the dis- torted anticipation, within the religious and figural master-code, of the idea of historical necessity and historical necessity in historical materialism." In other words, whatever is had to be, but we only know it too late, after we've acted; hence, we must keep acting. Translation: that the revolution has not yet occurred does not mean that it won't. Jameson suppresses my translation, of course, and proceeds to establish Milton's marxist credentials by equating him with Hegel and, immediately after, with Walter Benjamin. It is simply embarrassing to pursue these pages of "Religion and Ideol- ogy," to find that Jameson wants "all of" his speculations to be "'taken as a gloss and commentary on Walter Benjamin'' or that he wishes merely to " test" Machery against Milton. For, ultimately, Jameson argues that since Milton's God contains the contradiction of fate and freewill, and since Milton's God is so deplorable (he's 518 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="6">only human, Jameson contends), Milton's solution is merely ideological, not the marxist truth: "the requirement to give anthropomorphic figuration to the ideology of Providence ends up denouncing itself, and undermining the very ideology it set out to embody. Yet this is an objective and impersonal, what today would be called a textual, process: by a kind of ruse of reason, Milton's symbolic act is alienated from itself, turns against itself, ends up producing the opposite of what it originally intended." In other words, Jameson likes Milton's God no more than any other reader has (he tries to make Empson his ally). Among the assumptions Jameson voices, these need to be questioned: that anthropomorph- ism was a necessity in the representation of God; that Milton in- tended to make God jolly but couldn't quite cover up his nastiness; that figuration in Paradise Lost has, as its objective latency-its silence-a deconstructive power that Milton knows nothing about; that Jameson's "textual" process occurs without a reader. Machery fails Jameson's test, for he would say that texts are not ideologically straitened; Jameson would say that they are. We are a long way from any history here except the history of the place of Jameson's approach to the text. In the program of The Political Unconscious, the second frame of textual analysis is the ideologeme, a unit of analysis that involves the text and everything that it has marginalized or silenced. Again, this could be a valuable historical approach-to recognize that a world of other discourses surrounds the text, and that the hegemony of the text results from impositions and silencing. Jameson's muse for this frame is Bakhtin, and the dialogical is the form of contradic- tion he invokes. This frame, brought to bear upon Paradise Lost, yields fallacious fruit once again. Against Satan and God and Adam and Eve, Jameson reads the history of Milton's time in extraordi- nary ways. Since God is such a bully, one would expect, Jameson argues, that Satan would have a few glimmers of Cromwell. Not so, he says, for Satan is a tyrant, and therefore is-is-Charles. This is just plain wrong. Satan can illuminate both figures, but never rests in either equation. For Jameson, Milton is arguing that the revolu- tion (i.e. God) was right and inevitable (providence is history). Stated that way, one can scarcely object. Jameson, however, does, for real politics has been stripped from this schema. Where are the party workers? where are the revolutionaries? where is the petty bourgeoisie? All sadly absent from the simplistic equations of Mil- ton's religious figuration. Why, says Jameson, there is in this view Jonathan Goldberg 519</page><page sequence="7">"no longer any place for the army of the saints themselves"; all that wonderful concern for church organization in the prose ("A point- by-point anticipation of all the most vital problems of political or- ganization in our own time; problems of the party, of class solidar- ity, of the soviets .. . "); all gone. Yes, if the poem were only about God and Satan, Adam and Eve, this might be true in some way. But it isn't: the angelic host the Satanic crew, the entire course of history, explicit in Michael's narrative, implicit in every figurative turn of the narrative, in catalogues and similes, somehow these have been forgotten, and as for church organization, surely the de- bate of book 2, its echo in book 3, the council of Satan in heaven, Abdiel's account, all these might serve as instances of political or- ganization. Last frame of all, to end this strange eventful history, the ideology of form. Here, the text reveals its place in the only true history, that of the modes of production. History works a perpetual revolution, and at any time various modes are coexistent, contradictory; texts reveal this in their very form, and here, at last, the true shape of history is glimpsed. In Paradise Lost, you see, Satan is a feudal war lord, as is God, but "Adam is clearly of another species-the com- moner the first bourgeois." Jameson gives not a hint for the rea- soning behind the last point (it must be that a seventeenth-century text true to the modes of production must have a bourgeois gen- tilhomme somewhere); the routing of feudalism (God deconstructs himself and Satan too), however, is figured in Milton's text, Jame- son claims, in that extraordinary moment when Satan voyaging to- wards the new world (i.e., nascent capitalism) leaves behind the chaos of old outdated forms of production. Jameson quotes the last lines of book 2 (the only extended piece of text in his essay) and says that they demonstrate the moment when "something quite inconceivable in the previous system springs into being"&gt;; incon- ceivable indeed. The view here is wonderful, breathtaking: but it is not the joy at the advance of history towards the supremacy of the proletariat. After this, it is perhaps only as a kind of comic finale that Jameson takes on the fall or, rather, Eve's fall, for Adam's is never men- tioned. Jameson, who begins by praising Milton as "the great poet of sex" (two and a half lines about sweat are instanced), ends by denouncing him for sexism. "Eve has to fall, not because she is sinful or disobedient, but because Milton cannot find it in himself to imagine and give figuration to an equality between the sexes that 520 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="8">would open up into a concrete vision of free people." Earlier in the essay, to prove his nonsexist credentials, Jameson had referred to "the historian herself"; by the end, he is having his Turkish fan- tasies. His Adam never falls. But Milton does: he can no longer be enlisted by liberals, Jameson self-satisfyingly remarks; Milton's post-political text reveals "the operation of ideological closure," for it is (this is the last clause of the essay) "a poem in which as we have said the political is repressed [which] nonetheless ends up pro- ducing a political reading of itself." Or, to tell the truth, Jameson produces that political reading in which the poem's closures allow him to open up what a true poem would tell, the history of the revolution. The saddest thing about Jameson's reading is that Paradise Lost could tell that story, and that Jameson's principles could lead there too. This is not the place for me to attempt that political reading of the poem, but I don't want to leave Jameson without pointing to his most invigorating theoretical contribution, the broadening of the definition of the text that I have noted. History, Jameson says, along with Machery, is the absent cause of the text, and all texts are political. So far so good. But even better is this. History, he says, is itself a text, or, rather, makes itself available to us only in textual form. The Real (capitalized a la Lacan) "&lt;necessarily passes through its prior textualization, its narrativization in the political uncon- scious. And the text thus brings history with it in the only form in which history is available to us. The literary work or cultural object, as though for the first time, brings into being that very situation to which it is also, at one and the same time, a reaction" (82). The production of the text is also the reproduction of society, politics, history-and its production. To repeat: "history is inaccessible to us except in textual form, or in other words, . . . it can be approached only by way of prior (re)textualization" (ibid). Jameson, as I've indicated, does not live up to these ideas. They are, however, im- plicit in the approach of my second group of critics. Before I turn to them, however, I want to complete this marxist foray by consider- ing a text Jameson invokes, "Christopher Hill's great biography" of Milton.5 Milton and the English Revolution presents views that Hill has been arguing and developing for the past forty years, and this biog- raphy of Milton furthers his claims about the course of English history in the seventeenth century. There is much here of value; the details of the historical narrative are impressively arrayed, the Jonathan Goldberg 521</page><page sequence="9">stages in Milton's development are unexceptionably surveyed. The suggestion that Hill offered first in an appendix to The World Turned Upside Down, that Milton's ideas require the contextuali- zation of contemporary radical thought, was welcome there, and remains so. Yet, the fault of the extended biography lies in its very extension; after 500 pages, Hill is no further than he was in his appendix, and the focus of his original note emerges blurred, dis- torted, and shapeless. So too does Milton, and in the final pages of the biography, Hill gives a final turn to a phrase used throughout: "lthat great eclectic," is at last "the great equivocator." It is discon- certing," Hill continues, "to try to depict a man who has strong moral principles, for which he would die, without being able to state clearly what those principles are" (472). Although Hill seems to think that this problem rests with Milton, it is one he creates himself. It affects his historical method and dictates what happens when he tries to read Milton's poems in the light of history. After J. H. Hexter's devastating piece on Hill,6 it is hard not to find Milton and the English Revolution guilty of the sin of "lump- ing" that Hexter charges Hill with, the inability to make distinc- tions. It is this fault that causes Hill's final problem with Milton. Typically, Hill approaches an idea of Milton's only to lose it in a flood of commonplaces. Thus, of Areopagitica, he first writes, '4many of its ideas were commonplaces" (150). Servetus on tolera- tion is instanced and quoted. Then the English radical John Stoughton is brought in. No sooner is he quoted than Hill adds, "but Stoughton quoted Pico della Mirandola for the sentiment, so Milton may have got it direct." Milton is quoted, but Stoughton is not allowed to disappear. For Stoughton said "some shepherds . are wolves," and so did . . .. And, next sentence, "Stoughton was a friend of Dury and Hartlib," and they were Milton's friends too. And Hartlib published a work of Stoughton's "in which he linked Bacon, Comenius and Dury." And ... and ... and: the effect of this paragraph is simply maddening. Hill clearly believes that ideas are neat little units that anyone may have and repeat; they are radically decontextualized. But his attempt is to contextualize Milton; this means that anyone-or so it seems-could be called an influence or an analogue, and that any connection is as likely as any other. Equally typical of Hill's method as a historian is the paragraph that begins this way: "The idea of being a heretic in the truth can be found in Giordano Bruno, in Paolo Sarpi and among the Socinians, as well as in Bishop Carleton, William Chillingworth, John Fry, 522 The P~olitics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="10">John Knowles, Robert Boyle, James Nayler, Thomas Hobbes and Robert Barclay" (154). Naturally, Hill will find himself hard pressed to know Milton's principles when he can gather all these together and act as if they spoke with a single voice. Hill comes up with the formula "in dialogue with" to describe Milton's relationship with the radicals of the 1640s and 50s. The phrase waffles; it is a version of cliches about communication that were rife in liberal political thought a decade or two ago. Hill can- not quite claim that Milton was influenced by the radicals, nor that he influenced them, and since those are the only alternatives he can imagine, he is forced to have recourse to a phrase that could suggest either but claims neither. "Dialogue" has a lovely dialectical ring to it too, and although Hill wears his marxism far more lightly than Jameson, the term no doubt has its ideological appeal. At pains to disabuse his reader that he is a vulgar marxist-"ideas are not. . . a reflex of economics" (77), he writes-he substitutes something equally weak, the desire to find lower-class ideas percolating up to ivory-tower intellectuals. Hill cannot quite give up the all but dis- proved notion of the English revolution as a class war, and the attempt of the book is to associate Milton with the lower classes intellectually if not actually (Milton's antidemocratic remarks are too virulent for Hill to be able to establish more than an intellectual community, although, whenever possible, he tries to imagine Mil- ton out for a night at a pub or trading offcolor remarks). The book is full of cheap shots: Milton's visit to Italy is like a western European behind the iron curtain (56), and the hermetic ideas that Hill thinks he picked up there filtered, via Fludd ("There is a book to be written on 'Milton and Fludd' which will be far more important than any studies of Milton's classical or patristic sources" [6]), through the radicals, an "underground tradition" that emerges in Milton. For Milton, Hill twice says, could have shared the horrified awareness of Hopkins "writing (in 1871, of all years) 'horrible to say, in a manner I am a communist' " (96; cf. 337); Hill, of course, is not horrified to suggest, however glancingly, that the years 1640-60 cheer his marxist heart, and from "tantalizing hints" (70), he weaves a fabric stretching from Milton's radicalism to his own. Milton is &lt;'astonishingly liberal" for Hill; "some of Milton's verbal play re- minds us irresistibly of Karl Marx" (259); and "lest we should think of Milton's lines [PL 3:189-93] too passively," we are asked to ''compare them with Lenin's slogan in a similar post-revolutionary period after 1905" (389). Indeed, where Hill parts company with Jonzathanz Goldberg 523</page><page sequence="11">Jameson is in espousing a liberal marxism; there is no "&lt;post- political" Milton here. Instead, to the end, ever undaunted, Milton continues to believe in the revolution, and honing a paradise within is no post-political position. In this in fact Hill is closer to Milton's politics than Jameson. Not that Hill takes this insight to the heart of Milton's revolu- tionary stance; instead, as usual, he waffles. He can find nothing genuinely striking in Milton that he can't find elsewhere, and he can find so many things in Milton that he is forever declaring Mil- ton's paradoxes and contradictions to be a position taken in some middle ground, a stance of a dialogist between protestantism and the lunatic fringe. Milton is a synthesizer, a bourgeois radical; there is "uncertainty at the heart of Milton's personality" (337). I'm afraid these are autobiographical rather than biographical comments; most readers are overwhelmed by the force of Milton, not by the wavering that characterizes Christopher Hill. The muddle that Hill makes of Milton's beliefs affects his reading of the poems, to which over one hundred pages of the book are devoted. The problem is not simply that Hill is not a literary critic-this, indeed, ought not to be a problem if the aim is to rein- troduce Milton's texts in history, to find history in Milton's texts. But the method here, lacking the crabbed theories of Jameson or Machery, is a swirl of possibility. Hill doesn't want to read poems as political allegories, but he has hardly a notion of what else to do. He tries for analogies, parallels; but these keep becoming equations. Paradise Regained turns out to be "about" church government, Samson Agonistes speaks of the predicament of political action after 1660. Hill sees that Paradise Lost is complex, but he is rarely up to what he sees. Here are some typical interpretive remarks. "A poem about the Fall would among other things provide explana- tions of the failure of the godly in the English Revolution. Adam had been free to fall, and to fall he chose: the English people had taken a captain back for Egypt" (349). "The first battle in heaven was as inconclusive as Edgehill" (372). "If Abdiel was Milton the prose pamphleteer" (356), a sentence begins; to make matters worse, the if is soon forgotten; "if we take Adam as personifying the regenerate among the Parliamentarian leaders in the sixteen- fifties" (377) follows a similar path. "Satan, like Charles I, raised his standard in the north" (371). The poem breaks at book 7 because the revolution did in 1660 (365). Enough. Trying to "&lt;suggest paral- lels which might have been in Milton's mind" (380), but always 524 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="12">careful to hedge them with the uncertainty which must govern this method Hill tries to serve up a "relevant" Milton an "alternative" Milton. It is unfortunate, but true, that Hill has only the slightest notion of how poems function, what their relations to history and politics are. As I've indicated, the shapeless lump to which he re- duces Milton reflects Hill's notion of history all too well. If Jameson really means that Hill's is a "great biography" it can only be be- cause it confirms Jameson's predilection to read texts as one-for-one expressions of society. More often than Jameson, Hill is aware that Milton is a complicated thinker; he knows that Milton cannot be dismissed as a sexist, that his God is not there merely to be decon- structed. But the failure to be able to draw distinctions muddles the complexity of Paradise Lost, flattens paradoxes until they yield simple solutions, repeated equations in which Milton's text echoes the single text of history that Hill reads, the story of the revolution that has not yet quite occurred, but for which we must stand ever ready, ever waiting. These tendencies to flatten come close to the oldstyle historicism redevivus that I will return to in the final sec- tion of this essay. Before doing so, however, I want to turn to those critics who realize best the aims that marxist criticism announces. II "Modern theories of pastoral have a way of turning into theories of literature," Louis Adrian Montrose remarks, opening a recent essay; like much in Montrose's work, the sentence is self-reflexive, for in a remarkable series of essays on Elizabethan pastoral, Mon- trose has been advancing a claim about literature that radically opposes much that is usually thought.7 Against the escapist, nostal- gic readers of pastoral, both new critical and oldfashioned histori- cal, who cordon pastoral from life, Montrose argues for pastoral play as real work, that the form has a function. Depending on Put- tenham, he insists that otium is really negotium, that pastoralists 'Cnegotiat by coulor of otiation." Montrose shows that texts are events that do real work in a culture. This is, indeed, a theory of literature, a version of which we have met before. For Montrose, literature has a mediating-a dialectical-function. Writing of Spenser's "Aprill" eclogue and, by implication, of courtly pastoral in general, Montrose says that it illuminates "the dialectic by which poetic power helps to create and sustain the political power to which it is subservient" (ELR 168). Radical in this conclusion is the phrase "'create and sustain," which contains a complex view of the Jonathan Goldberg 525</page><page sequence="13">production of the text. Similarly, his essay on Peele opens describ- ing the Araygnement of Paris as a work that "'recreates the culture which creates it" (ELH 433)-the play on "recreate" condenses an argument-and ends by pointing to book 6 of The Faerie Queene as a version of pastoral "markedly analytical and critical in its repro- duction of Elizabethan court culture" (457). For Montrose, texts are not autonomous, nor are they repositories of timeless cultural truths or ideological impositions, nor, finally, is history to be found as an absence. Rather, Montrose argues that texts articulate the con- tradictions of the culture and are involved in their production (Elizabethan culture is, after all, given to us in its texts as much as in 'events'). Texts serve the needs and desires of those who produce them, those for whom they are produced, and those who witness them. Montrose's texts speak in many voices, and the function of criticism is to restore to the text as many materially specific ele- ments (the phrase could be Montrose's) as possible. Montrose aims to insert texts in history. To articulate the inter- relationships he develops a vocabulary of mediation in which such terms as dialectic, interaction, interplay, recreation, and repro- duction recur with frequency. His vocabulary registers the fact that while texts inevitably constitute the culture in which they operate, and which they reflect, there is no one pattern to which they sub- scribe. Some texts, like Peele's Araygnement, are meant mainly to celebrate the court and its queen; but this does not rule out the possibility that they also advance the claims of the author, and constitute a bid for preferment. Others, like Sidney's Lady of May, insinuate and glance (as Puttenham would say) at discontent even while they seem to allow the queen to do as she likes. What under- lies these possibilities (and they by no means cover the case) is the use of pastoral as a tool for advancement at court, the center of the social world. Pastorals pay homage to "Eliza, Queene of shepheardes," not as a lovely game or decorative play-the leisure class whiling the hours away-but to serve a class forever on the qui vive. Courts were perilous places; courting was a constant activity; success was never sure. Moreover, the very fact of aspiration, the desire for place and power, was potentially a threat to the queen, a threat to break boundaries and climb out of one's class. Elizabethan society, as Montrose sees it, was engaged in power struggles be- tween classes and generations, between the need to preserve order and the dynamics of change. Literature reflects, engages, and mediates these conditions. 526 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="14">Hence, Montrose's textualization of culture and historicization of texts implicitly denies Jameson's reduction of texts to ideological closure and resolution or Hill's simple causality. Montrose does not prioritize either text or context; both share the symbolic forms of the culture, both produce and are produced by them. His claims are nowhere more cogent or invigorating than in the essay on the pas- toral of power (ELR, 1980) which advances the thesis that "'objects and relations in the material world of peasant labor are sublimated into forms of lordly splendor" (160). Sublimation carries religious and psychological connotations. In this essay, Montrose's predomi- nant vocabulary is sociological and anthropological, however, and a "process of containment and decontamination" (165) is central to his argument. His point, put much too simply, is that courtly pas- toral is built upon material exploitation of agrarian workers by the landlords who were also the courtiers surrounding the queen. They wooed power in pastoral forms, as did poets, for they too were courtiers, and pastoral advanced middle class young men like Spenser and Peele as much as aristocrats like Sidney or Lord Chan- dos, '"King of the Cotswalds," who entertained the queen on prog- ress as a way of affirming that his workers were happy and that his local power constituted no threat to the center of power. Montrose justifies his religious terminology by arguing that another base for courtly pastoral is the medieval celebration of the shepherds hail- ing their newborn lord, and that the trick (as Empson has it) of social equanimity performed by pastoral depends upon that prior egalitarian tradition. The queen on progress or at court, wooed, exalted in language amorous and spiritual; this official discourse carried with it a great deal more: restless energies, disorderly de- sires, aspiration. Montrose is intent in many of his essays to dis- cover the homologies linking texts, religious experience, sexual ex- perience and social experience. But this is not in the service of reductive equations, but to further his claims for the complex in- teractions of the overlapping, intersecting and mutually creating spheres of art and life. Art and life met in the Elizabethan court and countryside, but not there alone. As Montrose argues in a suggestive essay that appeared in Helios, the public theater was supremely a place of purposeful play.8 "'The drama fulfilled manifold functions," he writes, "to neutralize social discontent; to assuage personal anxieties; and to provoke critical reflection upon the nature of society and the self" (65). Shakespeare was fond of the metaphor that made all the world Jonathan Goldberg 527</page><page sequence="15">a stage not because it reflects back upon him in some self-satisfying manner, but because the metaphor expresses the nature of reality. "Simply by projecting the model of homo ludens that is intrinsic to its own nature, Shakespeare's theatre articulates-and thereby helps its heterogeneous audience of social actors to adjust and to control-the ambiguities and conflicts, the hardships and oppor- tunities, arising from the ideologically anomalous realities of change" (64). This view recasts a theory of pastoral as a theory of drama, or rather, it too offers a theory of literature. We may see the shadow of Pierre Machery or Fredric Jameson behind it, for there is, in Montrose's work, a sophisticated marxist analysis implicit, and in his approach to the playhouse, he comes closest to finding the possibility of revolution in Elizabethan culture. The crucial dialec- tic for Montrose is that between generations, the struggle between the aspiring young and the conservative old. Change needs to be accounted for; the possibility that change can occur must be read into texts that appear to confirm power, and into the institutions- court, theater-that appear to preserve power. The opening that Montrose sees rises from below; from bottled frustrations, from grasping peers, from middle class aspirants to a piece of the pie, from masterless men and younger sons. The model for Montrose is thus marxist and Freudian, the repressed rise; and the model for containment and ideological hegemony is religious. Religion per- mits sublimation, and it is this function that cultural forms of secu- lar power also assume. The playhouse, once again, fulfills this for- mula as readily as the advent rituals surrounding the virgin queen, for drama arises from religion, and the theater replaced-or was in danger of replacing-the church as the community gathering place. It is the theatricality of culture that also informs the most pro- vocative book about the interaction of Renaissance text and context to appear in many years, Stephen Greenblatt's Renaissance Self- Fashioning: From More to Shakespeare.9 In an essay that appeared in Glyph 8 soon after the publication of this book, Greenblatt ad- dresses quite directly-and in terms quite different from Montrose's-the role of theatricality in Elizabethan culture. Change is a consequent concern for Greenblatt; the real question is subversion, how it is given a voice in Elizabethan culture, how it is recognized then and now. Resisting marxist explanations of an un- derground normally barred from discourse (and with it, most of the models upon which Montrose depends), for him, in the most radical sense possible, the text contains everything we can hope to find. 528 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="16">Contains is the crucial word here, and it houses a fundamental pun, a paradoxical argument that Greenblatt articulates; Shakespeare's drama, he says, "contains the radical doubts it continually pro- duces" (57). Whereas for Montrose, it is in the interests of the op- pressed to attempt to speak within culturally sanctioned voices- and there is room in those codes of theater and court to do so-for Greenblatt, it is in the interest of power to produce its own subver- sion: the "apparent production of subversion is . . . the very condi- tion of power" (ibid). Montrose offers several formulas for the way in which texts reflect cultural heterogeneity, express it, and ulti- mately deflate revolutionary impulses; Greenblatt, on the other hand, anatomizes a process that he calls testing, recording, and explaining, which is in the service of power. He uses two texts to illustrate, Hariot's account of Virginia and Shakespeare's I Henry IV. Hariot, who was regularly charged with atheism, offers a lovely case, for his Virginia account served Elizabethan imperialism. An official document, it yet produces subversion; as Greenblatt wittily remarks, the evidence against Hariot is found in this socially sanctioned text. If, as Greenblatt says, the culture contains subver- sive possibilities because they are not in fact threatening, it nonetheless assigns them to others. Such subversiveness actually furthers the ends of established power, Greenblatt argues, and is necessary to its impositions. The oppressed masses are not waiting their turn in history to become the hegemonic voices of the future; rather, hegemonic power establishes itself in the very form and practices which it denies. Shakespeare's Prince Hal is Greenblatt's theatrical example, Hal playing at rebellion, enticing Francis the drawer only to silence the rebellion he has created, Hal, in short, making clear that "theatricality is not set over against power but is one of power's essential modes" (56). Greenblatt's theater ends with the queen, Montrose's with the common man learning his part in Elizabethan society. Montrose's conclusion reflects a bias that Greenblatt exposes-the ease with which we identify subversive voices because they articulate our beliefs, the complacency that we bring to descriptions of ideological closure or cultural inscription precisely because Elizabethan ideas of order offer no threat to our sense of the world. Greenblatt opposes such divisions of Elizabethan culture into antagonisms of class, courtiers vs. aliens, the voices of hegemony and heterodoxy. In this frighteningly to- talistic and implicitly totalitarian vision, there is a single text, a dramatic script for life and art alike. Jonathan Goldberg 529</page><page sequence="17">In Renaissance Self-Fashioning, he scrutinizes this text as a cul- tural poetics, extending textual principles to history and politics. As the Glyph piece suggests, the text is a dramatic script, and this confirms both its hegemonic character and guards it against pre- mature closure or ideological fixity. Greenblatt's text, in short, while not the new critical monolith, is, nonetheless, inescapable, and this comment on The Faerie Queene typifies his method: "Spenser's poem is one manifestation of a symbolic language that is inscribed by history on the bodies of living beings"' (179). Greenblatt's book thus realizes-ideally-the endeavor that Jame- son's theories glimpsed, undertaking, as he says, an impure task that mingles life and art inextricably to disclose "'the social pres- ence to the world of the literary text and the social presence of the world in the literary text"' (5). Greenblatt's drama has an undeniable structuralist element; he repeatedly invokes an absence beneath this sustained play of the text, a theatricality played en abt^me. "Strip off the layer of theatri- cal delusion and you reach nothing at all" (14), he says of Sir Thomas More's activity in the world, and in Utopia too. "To make a part of one's own, to live one's life as a character thrust into a play, constantly renewing oneself extemporaneously and forever aware of one's own unreality" (31)-this, More's pattern, as Greenblatt unfolds it, was played out with variations in the lives of Tyndale and Wyatt, and in the plays of Shakespeare and Marlowe. The latter insists on "the essential meaninglessness of theatrical space, the vacancy that is the dark side of its power to imitate any place" (195), and Jago's subversion of Othello, which is, for Greenblatt, his sub- mission to narrativity, thrusts him into a play not of his own making. Greenblatt's scripts do not merely play over a void, they threaten to absorb the players-and all the world's a stage-or, conversely, they are all the players have to hold onto. Conventions are lived realities; at best, the void can be avoided by subscription to the already written, as in the case of Wyatt. "Wyatt and the other court poets are as much written by their conventional lyrics as writers of them" (139), and Wyatt achieves what we call a recognizable voice through the full participation in the dialectic of his culture: "'his achievement is dialectical; if, through the logic of its development, courtly self-fashioning seizes upon inwardness to heighten its his- trionic power, inwardness turns upon self-fashioning and exposes its underlying motives, its origins in aggression, bad faith, self- interest, and frustrated longing" (156). It is one of Greenblatt's ini- 530 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="18">tial tenets that "'self-fashioning is always, though not exclusively, in language"' (9), and the model for language is the one held by Gor- gias or Derrida. Greenblatt's text, unlike a marxist's, refuses to dif- ferentiate between texts and the Real (i.e., history). There is noth- ing that is not in the text, and even what might from another perspective be labelled as outside the text is brought in, is already in it. Hence, Greenblatt argues that identity and inwardness, rather than standing as a sign of self-possession and authenticity, is the reverse side of what might be said to be outside the self. What is projected as the demonic-call it Indians, or heretics, name it the Other, for short-is also within. From this perspective there is no need for Jameson's second frame in the exploration of the political unconscious of texts, the inquiry into what the text represses or makes marginal. "Achieved identity always contains within itself the signs of its own subversion or loss" (9); what sustains and gives sustenance to the performance of the self and the production of the text is also what subverts it, an absorbing drama. Achieved selfhood in Greenblatt's text would only issue in silence, for it is "the dream of a cancellation of identity itself, an end to all improvisation, an escape from narrative" (32). What Jameson calls the Real, Greenblatt labels as this dream and delusion. There is no world elsewhere, but there is an intense need for one in which to project the self, through which to fashion it. This accounts for the cultural circles in which Greenblatt locates his texts-colonialism in the new world, inquisatory explorations of the inner worlds of heretics-and explains why he finds Lacan the best gloss on Othello's character. For Lacan is acutely aware of the self as a construct made for and in the shape of an Other, of (as Greenblatt summarizes his position) "&lt;the dependence of even the innermost self upon a language that is always necessarily given from without and upon representation before an audience" (245). In Greenblatt's view, Renaissance Christianity creates these demands as the form of inward desire, and Christianity inscribes itself upon Indians and Africans, or upon Jews like Marlowe's ("Marlowe quickly suggests that the Jew is not the exception to but rather the true representa- tive of his society" [203]), or a heretic like Menocchio, the miller from Friuli, who managed to arrive at his heterodoxical beliefs by way of the most doctrinaire reading, including the bible. The bar- barity of nonChristian civilizations justifies the release of just such barbarity on the part of western invaders. Self-creation, like textual Jonathan Goldberg 531</page><page sequence="19">production, rests upon what has been excluded, banished to utter darkness, placed as an absence; Greenblatt calls this contained substratum subversion and submission. To the question of Milton's Satan, "'who can think submission," Greenblatt implicitly answers that no one can and everyone does. We are all already written so that even our rebellion has been prescripted or at the very least modelled on that which we would expell. And there is, as Greenblatt darkly intimates, a way in which the selves we make, the texts we write, woo destructivity, desire annihilation. Power, as Greenblatt defines it, lies in the ability "to impose fictions on the world and . . . to enforce acceptance of fictions that are known to be fictions" (141). In Shakespeare's theater Greenblatt finds what More dreamt, a "total" institution (112), the cultural form of absolute submission and pure dependence. The education received there, like the fashioning Spenser offered in The Faerie Queene, had as its end the imperial designs of Elizabethan culture. The gentlemen that Spenser imagines are the planters of Ireland, the voyagers to Guiana. Such texts gave Elizabethans an identity and taught them to identify themselves in ways that kept them from seeing that they were functions of these texts, and functionaries of state apparatuses of power inherent in these texts, and that they were walking time bombs, having ab- sorbed with these texts the Christian obsession with desire as self- destruction, and the Christian urge to proselytize by destroying alien societies. Selves so made are themselves colonized by an alien-by the Otherness of society-selves so made are alienated from themselves to be themselves. To be able to reiterate know- ingly lago's fearful line-"I am not what I am -this is what the prospect of Elizabethan power offered, and this is the vision of cultural poetics Stephen Greenblatt serves. This is a powerful and compelling account, far more persuasive in its particulars than any other considered thus far, and masterful in the design it traces. Greenblatt's reading of individual works is often astounding in its penetration, and by refusing the ideological imperatives that make most other critics (even the best) divide the field into opposing elements ripe for juxtaposition and dialectic, he manifests what I would characterize as an imperialistic and totalis- tic urge. Mastery, compulsion, power, and submission are over- arching elements that Greenblatt identifies as the principles of order in the period that cut across all putative boundaries, all sup- posed oppositions. His totalistic vision, however, has its price to 532 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="20">pay. There is in Greenblatt's work always the danger that Jago manifests, of an improvisatory insinuation that reduces all things solid to spectres, and that robs life of others in an absorbing theatri- cality. "Even a hostile improvisation reproduces the relations of power" (253), Greenblatt writes, and he is forever finding ways in which distinctions collapse to be absorbed and mastered by the overriding shape of power. Hence, although his book plots the careers of six figures over the course of the century, it also aligns them in pairs, refigures the pairings in third figures, finds that the opposing pairs resemble each other, that the resolving figures are also related to each other. The book thus has as its compelling drive one that Greenblatt identifies in the Glyph essay with Prospero's acknowledgement of the thing of darkness or Hal's assured refor- mation, a drive to master, control, and thoroughly absorb so that all others are taken into the self Greenblatt is fascinated with power, and his fascination tends to produce the effect that Max Scheler describes: a squirrel rapt by the movements of a snake watches immobile as it comes to devour him, submits with awe to what he ought sensibly to flee. Or we could perhaps say of Greenblatt what he says of Spenser, he worships power (174). For all the amazing range and brilliance of Greenblatt's book, it keeps returning to the force that demands submission and renunciation, and there is, I would suggest, in what is renounced some sense of what Greenblatt's work omits. Fascination with Hal and Prospero, for instance, seems to make it impossible to conceive that their plays do not regard them with equal awe. Spenserian worship of Gloriana and her court too quickly rules out the possibility that Spenser, even by imitating and replicating the queen's power, failed to put his unwavering stamp of approval on it. Greenblatt dismantles sub- versions upon which Elizabethan power builds as if all discourse paid homage to the queen; Bakhtin and Foucault might serve as antithetical models for the discursivity of culture. There is in Greenblatt's work too great a need not to express the possibility that what he calls containment may not in fact have been absolute, a need related to the desire of his project to contain all in a control- ling frame. Greenblatt's theater thus, at times, can be like Hal's, offering an "odd blend . .. of spaciousness . . . and claustrophobia" (Glyph 56). Both dazzle, in the range of knowledge and allusion, in the force of compression and control. And yet, at times, these im- pulses produce a fearful narrowing of the field, a denial to Shakes- peare and Spenser of the full range of their energies, to the culture Jonathan Goldberg 533</page><page sequence="21">as a whole all that does not fit within and that would question Greenblatt's cultural poetics. A useful corrective to such mastering impulses can be found in the recent work of some historians. The Essex Sociology of Litera- ture Conference, to which Jameson contributed, features pieces by structuralists and feminists as well as marxists, efforts symptomatic of such work. I do not mean to suggest that they uncover new facts particularly, since I would agree with Greenblatt and Jameson that history is always available to us in the already narrativized form of historical discourse. Rather, the Essex volume suggests possible ways of reconceiving and recreating the period-for things do hap- pen, however difficult it is to render events in words, however the rendering makes events into words and subjects them to them. These essays can be placed beside a recent revisionist movement within conventional historical discourse that challenges received opinion about the seventeenth century-for instance, the work of Conrad Russell and Kevin Sharpe,10 which argues that categories historians have traditionally marshalled-court vs. country, king vs. parliament-are labels possible only in hindsight. There was no civil war for the first forty years of the seventeenth century, and the language of opposition was no different from the language of the majority (in fact, majority and opposition apply a parliamentary model for a period in which these terms make no sense). To label history in hindsight means to narrativize history in a certain way, to view its course as linear and teleological and to assume that one can read back. While the work of a marxist critic like Jameson replaces traditional history with another master narrative-the story of the failed revolution yet to come-radical and revisionist historians open up the field to a variety of rewritings and rereadings. They suggest that before we can trace a contained cultural poetics we need to bear in mind how much of our sense of Renaissance history comes to us through narratives that must be questioned. A recent collection of essays, Patronage in the Renaissance,11 addresses one such question by reminding us that a social institu- tion that is marginalized and somewhat suspect in our own time was central in the Renaissance. Historians have tended to view networks of patronage too readily as symptoms of corruption or sycophancy when in fact scarcely a segment of cultural activity in the Renaissance remained untouched by it, and alliances of mar- riage and friendship, readers and writers, kings and court painters, all come under the general rubric of patronage. As Arthur Marotti 534 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="22">remarks, opening an essay on Donne's career, all literature of the Renaissance is the literature of patronage. It is not merely that the institution requires rethinking on our part, however, but that hav- ing granted its all-pervasiveness, we need not credit it with con- taining or regularizing the shape of the culture more than it did. For the ties and links, the networks that patronage involve, are resistant to easy generalizations. Gordon Kipling shows, for instance, that Henry VII established his court as a center of artistic patronage in a manner that was both ad hoc and that involved massive importation of cultural forms-and artists-from Burgundy. Modern historians, ever since Bacon, have tended to regard Henry as a tightfisted monarch, loathe to support the arts; as Kipling shows, nothing could be less true, but because Henry created a bureaucracy, and drew on a cultural heritage which did not ultimately become the dominant one (humanism opposes Burgundian chivalry), we have tended to take no notice of Henry's activities. Yet the court offices he created all were meant to enhance the monarch. Kipling's essay demon- strates that even when a relatively autocratic ruler created virtually out of thin air an establishment to promote his rule it could fail to create a lasting effect. Conversely, in what is probably the most stimulating historical essay in the volume, Malcolm Smuts argues that Charles IS inheriting the very machinery that Henry got going, was hamstrung by the bureaucratic structures that he inherited. Thus, Inigo Jones, arguably the most important artist at court and vital to the political uses of art, was given the office of Surveyor of the King's Works, a position that hardly tallied with his many roles. Even more striking is the career of Gentilleschi, who served as a court painter although on the payroll of Buckingham's widow until she finally forced the king to create a post for him and relieve her of the drain on her capital, or Van Dyck, who held the post of court painter at the same time as Mytens did. As Smuts says, all this is extraordinary, since the king firmly believed in the political func- tion of art; yet he never developed a bureaucracy to enforce his views, allowed others to hold the reins of patronage rather than controlling them himself (he couldn't in fact afford the autocratic ideal he believed in). Further, for all of Charles's efforts to make art subservient to politics, he tended to produce court extravaganzas that insulated the court from the rest of the country. The result was the paradox that "'an art-loving king attuned to the values of early baroque culture, with its emphasis upon the didactic functions of art and literature, nonetheless failed to launch a program of cultural Jonathan Goldberg 535</page><page sequence="23">propaganda and ceremonial display remotely comparable to those of several Continental courts" (173). Smuts concludes that a system of decentralization that Elizabeth had fostered had, by the time of Charles I, failed; the loose ties of her court always managed to reflect back upon the monarch, but with Charles, individual ele- ments fell away from the center, and the center turned in upon itself. It is not, Smuts concludes, that Charles was more extravagant than Elizabeth-although that is the charge often made-but that he was less visible than the queen had been. He was defeated by a system that had promoted Elizabeth's power and extended it from queen to court and countryside. There was thus in the day to day running of the court far more flexibility (or incompetence) than we usually find when we offer grand designs of cultural hegemony. As Charles Hope argues in an essay on the patronage of the arts, it is art historians who have created the notion that painters in the Renaissance were bound by complicated and exact commissions, usually provided by humanists resident at court. In case after case, Hope shows that such condi- tions cannot be found as a regular phenomenon. This need not mean, I would add, that we should substitute some naive view of individualism to replace cultural determinism; rather, we should recognize the possibility of movement within the dominant posi- tion, the existence of other traditions (like Kipling's usually sup- pressed Burgundian elements); we must realize that the views we place on the Renaissance may serve our ends (the humanistic tradi- tion in arts and letters probably has more to do with the second world war than with anything that happened in the Renaissance), and that to participants at the time transactions in the social system seemed far more opaque than we can imagine. Arthur Marotti's essay on Donne reminds us of this, for as he reviews Donne's career, with its failures to gain support of patrons and the ultimate ecclesiastical preferment of the king, we can see that Donne's movements within the system were based on miscalculations that nonetheless he must have had some reason to believe would work. Marotti appears to think that Donne was blinded by ambition (the word is used frequently in his essay), but this seems to me too simple an explanation (it also ignores his ultimate success). Stephen Greenblatt would perhaps argue that the system gave the illusion that a certain amount of individual latitude was possible, but that this finally was simply an illusion, self-creation taking place over a void, Donne's innermost desires coming nonetheless 536 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="24">from his culture. The crucial question that this leaves is what one means by illusion. The word can take us to a most important contribution to the patronage volume, Stephen Orgel's essay, "The Royal Theatre and the Role of King." Orgel's work is important for Greenblatt's model of cultural theatricality and, as Montrose's frequent acknowl- edgements make clear, to him as well. Orgel's recent essay, like his earlier books, stresses the power of illusion. His subject is the traf- fic between the monarch and the stage, a two-way affair. The first half of the essay shows how kings depended upon the trappings of culture, the second how the culture depended upon the king. Yet, in Orgel's account this is not simply a mirror effect, nor is there perfect reciprocity between the king and the stage. From the start, there is complication in his work not to be found in Greenblatt's; theatricality is more than a metaphor for Orgel. He is concerned with real stages as well as imagined ones, and he refuses easy distinctions between the real and the imagined, dismissals of illu- sion as mere illusion. It is not that Orgel refuses to call an illusion an illusion, but that he would not on those grounds deny it reality, a status in the world. The key terms in his account are validation and its double, legitimization. Orgel shows the processes by which kings and stages come to have credit in the world; acts of the imagi- nation are involved, acts that really constitute them. So saying, Orgel is not guilty of reifying texts; rather, he shows that a culture's own acts of narrativization constitute a vital part of its reality, con- tribute to the real workings of power. Whereas Greenblatt would strip off illusions to find nothing there, and Jameson would uncover the suppressed story of the suffering proletariat (history is what hurts), Orgel shows that narrative is one of the things that happens in history and one of the ways in which history itself takes place. Acts of the mind are real acts. Kings used the past, used myths and theater as means of self-creation; they are living embodiments of words on pages. But words on pages take their life from kings: mythologies are written as genealogies, from Ovid on, because rul- ers legitimize their power by creating ancestries that go back to the gods. Poets then claim power by royal acts of appropriation. The actual physical theater at the English court offers an image of the social cosmos, that is, nonetheless, the truth about the organization of power-or that makes it true by giving it human form. But the public theater comes ultimately to be replaced by folio volumes. It becomes legitimate theater when textualized, when the perma- Jonzathan7 Goldberg 537</page><page sequence="25">nence of print replaces the evanescent show. Orgel's work under- mines easy beliefs that things are real and words aren't, or that the translation of events into words, words into events merely reifies the text and empties reality of real content or mystifies reality by nar- rativizing it. When, in the reign of Charles I, an attack on the theater is seen as inherently an attack on the king, then those strange bed- fellows, the stage and the monarch, have become inseparable. Symbolic acts have real force in the world. III Although I do not have space to consider all the recent critical work that illuminates connections between literature and political life in the English Renaissance-valuable essays by Leonard Ten- nenhouse, Steven Mullaney, Leah Sinanoglou Marcus and Richard Helgerson, and Richard McCoy's book on Sidney can only be mentioned'2-J cannot close without remarking the persistence of older modes of criticism, and the sad fact that these represent a historicism vitiated of the vitality and intelligence and moral seri- ousness of the work of Douglas Bush or Helen Gardner and devoid too of the rigor of a Cleanth Brooks. Exemplary here is Gary Schmidgall's Shakespeare and the Courtly Aesthetic,' a "milieu study" (5) of The Tempest which offers no illumination on either historical or literary matters. At the close of Renaissance Self- Fashioning, Greenblatt remarks that no one would want to repre- sent Shakespeare as a spokesman for Tudor commonplaces; this, however, is Schmidgall's aim, and he presents The Tempest as a recasting of Elizabethan homilies and other timeless truths. Schmidgall claims that Shakespeare's play offers a guide to the nature of civilization, but to him this means that it recapitulates commonplace orthodox notions of order and control. Com- monplaces, Schmidgall avers, are what lurk beneath the surfaces-so dazzling-of Shakespeare's play. The dazzle Schmid- gall calls the courtly aesthetic. This, for him, is as thneiess as the truths clothed; courts have always, from time to time, he says, sought to celebrate themselves in gorgeous works of art, such is "the congenial, idyllic, and bright superficies of the courtly aes- thetic" (77). The Jonsonian masque is one such courtly efflores- cence, and Shakespeare's play is a reflection of that courtly art. There are so many things the matter with this view that it is difficult to know where to begin. Let us start with Schmidgall's explanation for courtly art: "the Stuarts naturally gravitated toward the unreal world of art because the realities of courtly finances, 538 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="26">social change, and burgeoning anti-monarchical sentiment would scarcely support their wishes" (15). Courtly art-and, perhaps, all art-for Schmidgall is unreal. Thus, although at times he cites such notable guides to the Stuart court as D. J. Gordon, Roy Strong, Angus Fletcher, or Stephen Orgel, he has failed to understand the real role that art played in the court, its engagement in political events and its status as a political event. The dichotomy of art and reality that Schmidgall offers is based on further distortions and misunderstandings-in his list of "realities" (always harsh), almost all depend on interpretations of the Stuart scene that have under- gone extensive revaluation by historians for the past twenty years. His Jacobeans support "'rose-colored spectacles" (44) unaware of the world around them. One would have thought no one had taken such a view for a very long time; indeed, in an opening attack on the vapidity of recent Shakespeare criticism, Schmidgall yearns for the good old days. His book is resolutely outdated. For Schmidgall, courtly art is mere prettification, lavish, essen- tially mindless displays. Shakespeare, Schmidgall says, "'moved with the mood of the times" (30) toward such courtliness after an initial "drift toward the public theatrical arena" (32) (one staggers at the misunderstandings about the kinds of theaters in the time and the misinformation that this view of Shakespeare's career offers-as if he ever stopped writing for the Globe, as if he ever wrote for a plebian audience that he scorned). He came to it in order to present timeless truths of this kind: "on a political level, Stephano and Trinculo represent the many-headed monster, all too easily dis- posed to the monster's most notable sin, rebellion" (115): Caliban is even worse, and Prospero is perfect, an image of temperate rule, total control. These truths-of good and evil facing each other across an unfathomable void of unmediated social antagonism-are the simplicities of courtly art, meant only to flatter monarchs and confirm them in their self-satisfaction. Of course, there is nothing to recommend this view of the play or of the culture it supposedly reflects. In The Tempest, as one would have thought any under- graduate knew, a case can be made for Caliban: he has been usurped and Prospero's rule is as suspect as Antonio's; rather than being worse than Stephano and Trinculo, Caliban is shown to be a victim of questionable European habits of colonization;14 moreover, he is allowed the final dignity of choosing to reform. Shakespeare, in short, is not the snob Schmidgall would have him be. Nor is he Prospero, whose rages and failures of control are not taken into account, who is not a deity (despite what Schmidgall Jonathan Goldberg 539</page><page sequence="27">says, the play is evidently sceptical of such claims, and it is always a moment of simplicity when someone calls another a god, or imag- ines the possibility of perfect rule), nor capable of reforming Antonio and Sebastian (Schmidgall sees perfect joy at the play's end). Equally to the point is the fact that the function of courtly art is not simplistic either. Schmidgall's account of masques might re- flect those trends Jonson sought to stem, trends towards sheer spectacle; they ignore the fact that Jonsonian masques in both antimasque and main masque offer complex reworkings of the realities of court rooted in "present occasions." It was not empty flattery to tell the king he was a god at court, for from him all bounties flowed; nor did Jonson fail to portray his pleasure-loving court before James's eyes. Schmidgall, however, sees courtly art in simplistic dualistic terms, any engagement in real events an unfor- tunate lapse from its spectacular vacuity. Fiction is nothing in Schmidgall's eyes, reality base, fading, something to be scorned and mourned. Shakespeare and the Courtly Aesthetic refuses to take history or politics seriously, nor does it reveal the slightest ability to read literary texts. Although it pretends to link literature and politics, it reduces both to empty formulas about all works of literature and all moments of history. Its view of absolute good facing absolute evil leads to the conclusion that such "polarities were common features of the courtly aesthetic and offered writers frequent occasion to express the view that a healthy and humane courtly life is society's greatest good" (156). In other places, we are told that such figures as Spenser's Calidore or Shakespeare's Prospero are the very beau ideal of courtly writers. For Schmidgall, political ideals are beauti- ful constructs, works of art fanciful dreams. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is real in this aestheticized view, neither texts nor events. All fade into a vapid haze. Schmidgall exhibits the reverse side of the misguided practice of Frances Yates in her final book, in which earlier important reas- sessments of neoplatonic and hermetic/cabalistic strains in Renais- sance culture lead to finding Dr. Dee everywhere.'15 Like Hill, Yates discovers the underground wherever she looks, animating all literary figures; "'the dominant philosophy of the Elizabethan age was .. . the occult philosophy" (75), there is a "Dee-Spenser point of view," and Dee is reflected in King Lear and "shadowed through Prospero" (77). This is the particularistic version of Schmidgall's more vacuous lumping. It is also to be found in the works of literary 540 The Politics of Renaissance Literature</page><page sequence="28">historians-I think of Barbara Lewalski's recent Protestant Poetics and the Seventeenth-Century Religious Lyric 16 -who produce timeless formulas, which they call history, and fit poems into them so that they all emerge as examples of a manageable and un- threatening pattern. The debate between Brooks and Bush can dis- solve in this view, as it does when Annabel M. Patterson finds in Marvell and the Civic Crown 17 that the "Horatian Ode" "mediates not between two political camps but between two interdependent theories (which rhetoric has always recognized as pathos and ethos) of how language works upon the human mind" (68). Such impulses of containment are all versions of the old historicism infused, how- ever, by the desire of formalism to remove poems from the world. In these historical accounts, history becomes formalism, and texts are safely relegated to a courtly aesthetic, or to Patterson's figure of "Marvell the Writer" in whom "irony and detachment about him- self remained his characteristic mode" (10), or to Lewalski's "com- mon aesthetics" (12) and "widely accepted schema" (13) of a bibli- cal poetics and a protestant paradigm for salvation, or even to the "occult philosophy of the Elizabethan Age." Each of these con- structs has the vaguest of relations to history, literary history, or particular texts, new pigeonholes for old truths, the beautiful, the good and the true. In these old truths, old style history and new criticism meet, and the modernist text has become history. For critics with these beliefs, history is timeless, and literary texts re- peat eternal truths. In such a view, neither history nor texts are real.
