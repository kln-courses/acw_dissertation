<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Hick. The Metaphor of God Incarnate. Pp. 180. (London: SCM, 1993). ?9-95 This book is addressed to intellectually dissatisfied Christians who find no meaning in orthodox statements and to those outside the churches who have the same difficulties. The clear purpose, therefore, is to win over both groups and in some respects Hick will be successful. The title reflects the contro? versial collection edited by Hick, The Myth of God Incarnate 1977, and ad? vances the same argument. What is new is Hick's critical assessment of Christological works previously not attended to by him. It could be seen as an updating of his previous position in conversation with some Anglo American anaytical defences of'orthodoxy'. In this reviewer's reading, the shift from 'myth' to 'metaphor' signifies no 'literal' advance in the con? ceptual terms of the earlier debate. That is a shame. The argument running over fifteen chapters is as follows. Jesus in the New Testament did not understand himself as the Second Person of the Trinity incarnate. Rather, he would have understood himself (following E. P. Sanders) as a restorationist eschatological prophet and as thoroughly Jewish and non-divine. The church, with increasing Greek philosophical influence, divinized him, thereby turning love language into hard prose, metaphorical language into literal confession. (We have to wait until chapter 10 for the key term 'metaphor' to be discussed.) What resulted was an impossible dilemma for orthodoxy : how to explain the inexplicable ; how to defend the claim that this single man Jesus was also God. Hick follows this theme through by attending to a major recent defence of Chalcedonian orthodoxy in the work of T. V. Morris and also in terms of kenotic Christology in the work of Frank Weston and Stephen Davis. All fail to explain the inexplicable, without resort to mystery - which will not suffice to do the job, except by deferral. After lamenting the authoritarianism that has been unleashed by much orthodox christology, Hick dwells on the possibility of plural incarnations. Clearly, on his terms this is possible, for incarnation is basically an embodi? ment of certain values and truths that reflect the divine - not a unique act of self-revelation. In the key chapter on metaphor, he distinguishes meta? phor from literal language which is the 'dictionary' sense of a word, whereas metaphorical language works by differing from the dictionary sense (98).</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 137 Hence, there is an ' ineliminable and indefinable aura of meaning to meta? phor' (100). It is odd that his rendering of the metaphor of incarnation is susceptible to being exhausted so tersely in prose. (Hick seems to have abandoned his early equation of the 70's between scientific language and literal language.) He then dismantles the final triad of central truths taken 'literally' (incarnation and trinity have fallen, now atonement - see p. 12) in criticising Richard Swinburne's defence of atonement on the cross. In the final three chapters Hick relates his discussion to the world religions, arguing that his view of incarnation not only facilitates internal coherence and credibility, but also allows Christianity to affirm the presence of the divine reality within the world religion in so much as one finds a turning away from self-centredness to reality-centredness in different degrees and forms. The church must celebrate rather than mourn this. As always, Hick's writing is clear and to the point and whatever one may think of his arguments, the book presents a clear series of questions and challenges and is welcome for its statement of a position that has increasing following within the churches and outside as well - this is Hick's (ambiguous) 'success'. I would wish to raise three brief questions. First, Hick assumes that if one accepts as one's starting point that Jesus is 'truly God, truly human', then 'it is always possible to save the traditional dogma by stipulating definitions that allow it to be true ' (73). This is portrayed as a kind of moving the goal posts during the game. Now this is an important point because there has been an influential critique of'theism' whereby, it is argued, the defi? nition of ' God ' and the ' human ' is not knowable apart from Jesus Christ. This is best stated in the modern peirod by Karl Barth. If this is the case, then much of Hick's problematic dissolves as he presupposes definitions of both the divine and human nature that are learnt prior to the incarnation. It is arguable that his conception of the problem guarantees that it will not be resolved in his terms ! ? and therefore, for Hick, cannot be resolved per se. This is an unwarranted generalisation from the particular to the general. This leads to a major weakness, which relates to my second point. His lack of methodological engagement is reflected in his lack of conversation part? ners. All writers are guilty of this, but can Hick seriously claim to suggest that Christianity should be ' liberated from the network of theories - about Incarnation, Trinity and Atonement' which apparently 'obscure' its mean? ing (12-13) without attending to the major attempts to restate and think through these doctrines in the modern period. Barth, Rahner, Moltmann, Pannenberg, Kasper and J?ngel (to name only a small number) have all laboured to affirm these three central doctrines and are highly sensitive to philosophical issues and are widely recognized as major figures. None of their Christologies are dealt with. Why? My final point concerns language. Religious language must be meta? phorical and analogy is at the heart of Christian discourse (e.g. Aquinas). Any</page><page sequence="3">I38 RELIGIOUS STUDIES other form of speech would veer towards idolatry or anthropomorphism. But Hick seems to assume in chapter ten that most Christians have understood their Christianity 'literally'. This is undocumented by Hick and unwar? ranted. The sooner the christological debate moves out of this sterile binary option (metaphor or literal) the better. Such conceptuality obscures rather than illuminates the very real questions regarding the coherence of the incarnation. Gavin D'Costa University of Bristol</page></plain_text>
