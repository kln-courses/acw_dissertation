      <p>Jonathan Jacobs is a master of metaethics. His book assays the ethical canon of three of the greats of Jewish philosophy: Saadiah Gaon (882–942), the first systematic Jewish philosopher, author of <italic>The Book of Critically Chosen Beliefs and Convictions</italic>; Bahya Ibn Pakuda (fl. ca. 1040) and his classic <italic>Book of Direction to the Duties of the Heart</italic>; and Moses Maimonides (1138–1204), author of the <italic>Guide to the Perplexed</italic>. All three were polymaths who wrote in Arabic.</p>
      <p>Born in Egypt, Saadiah became a leading Talmudist at Baghdad but also a pioneering lexicographer, grammarian, liturgist, and Arabic translator and commentator of the Hebrew Bible, his readings still cited by Bible scholars. Saadiah’s zest for the sciences and penetrating philosophical and psychological insights lend lasting value to his work. Bahya, a religious judge in Muslim Spain, elaborates an intellectualist pietism in which human reason motivates the sound intentions that differentiate empty moralism, legalism, or ritualism from openhearted love and piety. Rabbi Moses ben Maimon, traditionally called the Rambam, an acronym of his name (<italic>Maimonides</italic> being a coinage used in Latin translations), was a physician, author of ten medical works in the Galenic/Avicennan tradition, and a major jurist. His commentary on the Mishnah, the ancient code of Jewish law (Halakha); his responsa addressing knotty cases; and his catalog of the 613 biblical commandments, the backbone of Halakha, are actively studied in lay and learned circles to this day. His codification of Halakha, the <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic>, written in the Hebrew of the Mishnah, remains the authoritative reference he meant it to be but is also sometimes studied with devotional intensity, a role that even he never envisioned for it.</p>
      <p>Saadiah lays out his ethical ideas in the later sections of his famous summa. His method is inductive: he collates the prescriptions of the scriptural canon much as he collects its grammatical, lexicographic, and poetic usages. No biblical claim or precept, he argues, will contradict reason or the senses, sound tradition, or another text. In cases of apparent conflict, surface meanings must be set aside. But finding the true sense is no arbitrary matter: any proposed figurative reading must be confirmed by the sense demanded of its terms elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Saadiah’s ethics is humanistic, affirming moral realism and human freedom and responsibility where the rising Islamic orthodoxy of his contemporary al-Ash‘ari (d. 935) denies human power to “create” our own acts and upholds a mordant theistic subjectivism. Where Saadiah pegs the legitimacy (and stability!) of God’s rule to divine grace and justice, since only fear, weakness, or ignorance would provoke wrongdoing, al-Ash‘ari insists that God need not answer to mere human notions: justice for us is obedience, but there would be no wrong in God’s commanding what we take for evil—or even punishing our obedience. “There’s no injustice to a chattel” was the Ash‘arite watchword: ours not to reason why. As Jacobs observes, “among medieval Jewish philosophers we do not find a significant current of thought comparable” to such a view (111). Thus, Saadiah rejects the temptation of homilists to seek some hidden fault that would warrant Job’s sufferings. That would only replicate the bad faith (<italic>ma‘al</italic>, Job 21:34; cf. 13:8, 16) of Job’s would-be comforters. Saadiah’s Job <italic>knows</italic> he’s innocent of crimes deserving of his torments. His self-knowledge—of a piece with the integrity that forbids him to accept his wife’s bitter counsel to curse God and die—also grounds Saadiah’s affirmation of human freedom in ways that Jacobs compares with the arguments of Thomas Reid, Roderick Chisholm, and C. A. Campbell (56).</p>
      <p>The moral realism coupled with Saadiah’s affirmation of human freedom particularly commends his philosophy to Jacobs: “Jewish moral thought involves the principle that ‘ought’ implies ‘can’”—a principle made workable in part by God’s covenant: “It entails specific requirements that have been explicitly disclosed”—and in part by God’s justice. “If a just and merciful God has revealed the Torah as an aid to, and a guide for, human beings, then human beings must be <italic>able</italic> to follow the Torah” (18). “This does not imply that right action is easy or that it is what one <italic>of course</italic> does. … Knowledge, choice, and effort of will are always required.” But “there is guidance for the will that is not present in Platonic and Aristotelian ethics” (70–71).</p>
      <p>The hallmark of Bahya’s pietism is his use of the word <italic>heart</italic>, most familiar to us, perhaps, from Pascal’s words, “The heart hath reasons that reason knoweth not,” but well precedented in works like <italic>Food for the Heart</italic> by the Muslim pietist al-Makki (d. 996). But in Bahya, unlike Pascal, the heart’s tug-of-war is not with reason. For, as Jacobs notes, Bahya uses the terms ‘heart’, ‘intellect’, and ‘intention’ “almost interchangeably” (33). The real tension is with the sophistries of the selfish ego, dramatized in reason’s internal dialogues with “inclination” (<italic>hawā</italic>), a stand-in for the <italic>yetzer ha-ra‘</italic> (evil inclination) of rabbinic parlance.</p>
      <p>The prominence Bahya gives to themes of trust in God and the duty of self-scrutiny announce his pietism clearly, as does his treatment of the more generic themes of gratitude, humility, repentance, and devotion. Gratitude, Jacobs writes, has a centrality in covenantal Judaism “that it just does not have in non-theistic ethics” (37; cf. 78, 116). That’s clear in Saadiah, where gratitude explains the rationality of worship. The same is true of other values—penitence and forgiveness, for example (94, 103). But the striking philosophical turn in Bahya’s pietism is the role of understanding in transforming mere obedience into ethically meaningful, spiritually elevating action. “The duties of the limbs,” Bahya warns, “are of no avail unless our hearts choose to do them and our souls desire their performance.” Or again, “obedience based on the Law is like an introduction to obedience based on reason.”</p>
      <p>Glossing the biblical command to love God with all one’s heart and soul and might (Deut. 6:5; cf. 18:13), Bahya holds that authentic obedience demands commitment, energized and directed by reason—the heart here preserving its biblical sense, as the seat of understanding. Intelligence for Bahya merges with love and caring. It is not their antithesis. Motivation, then, comes naturally to it—as it does in Spinoza, where understanding <italic>is</italic> commitment, and as it does not in Hume, where ideas cannot be motives. Piety for Bahya is an intellectual project all the way down: all who can, he urges, must study the marks of grace and wisdom in nature. One is remiss who is capable of anatomy, astronomy, physics—or any of the sciences and arts—but fails to explore and exploit them.</p>
      <p>Unlike Saadiah and Maimonides, Bahya is of two minds about free will. The rational and scriptural arguments pro and con, he confesses, seem to balance. He resolves the equipollence not by the skeptic’s ploy of suspending judgment but in pietist style, admonishing readers to resist the temptation to find moral and spiritual excuses in a sense of helplessness even as one loads oneself down with worldly anxieties and regrets. Reason counsels just the opposite: to assume maximal moral and spiritual responsibility but leave one’s material fortunes in God’s hands. Trust for Bahya does not lead to fatalism; and pietism, similarly, does not lead him to quietism: ignoring his Karaite contemporaries, he warmly endorses medicine, with appreciation for the natural means of preserving health that God provides.</p>
      <p>Exiled from their native Cordova after its fall to the extremist Almohad conquerors, Maimonides’s family seem to have spent years as crypto-Jews, finding refuge finally in Fatimid Cairo, soon to be ruled by Saladin, the Kurdish founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Al-Qadi al-Fadil, the Virtuous Judge, as Saladin’s éminence grise was known, had engineered that Sultan’s rise. He admired Maimonides and relied on him as a physician and as spokesman of Cairo Jewry. Later he would protect him against capital charges of apostasy when a new arrival from the West denounced the Rambam as a fallen-away Muslim.</p>
      <p>Maimonides won fame among Jews far beyond Egypt for his Arabic commentary on the Mishnah, which opened with a claim characteristically fusing rationalism with traditionalism: every Mosaic law was given with its explanation. In the <italic>Guide</italic>, Maimonides would address core issues of philosophical cosmology (“physics”) and theology (metaphysics)—creation and eternity, providence and evil. But he opened the work by confronting the seeming paradox of biblical anthropomorphism captured in the rabbinic marvel at “the boldness of the prophets who likened a creature to the Creator” (Genesis Rabbah 27, quoted in <italic>Guide</italic>, I 46).</p>
      <p>Ethical issues are broached in the <italic>Guide</italic> through the traditional device of seeking the sense of God’s commandments (the mitzvot). Every commandment has reasons, Maimonides argues, even blaming (the unnamed) Saadiah for calling some mitzvot “rational”—as though others were not. The Talmudic sages, most of whom agreed that the commandments all had reasons, be they readily accessible or unknown, had said that some commandments would perforce have been laid down by human agency had they not been revealed; but many—ritual laws in particular—depend on revelation.</p>
      <p>Saadiah’s considered view was that even the “rational” mitzvot are incomplete without the parameters supplied by prophecy: reason pronounces theft unjust, but only positive legislation can lay down, say, how property is rightly acquired—or establish sanctions for theft. Maimonides nuances this view, assigning broad and patent purposes to every Halakhic law but calling it a fool’s errand to search for reasons of the particularities of the mitzvot. In modern parlance, laws are underdetermined by the principles that warrant them. Legal details and modalities reflect a plethora of circumstances, cultural and material, quite incidental to a law’s root purposes. Such determinants are expressive of concerns more readily assigned to God’s will than to what we might first think of as God’s wisdom.</p>
      <p>Against legal positivism, Maimonides argues that to make the mitzvot ends in themselves rather than instrumental goods is to deem God’s act of revelation vain, futile, or frivolous (<italic>Guide</italic>, III 25–26). Biblically grounded laws serve our needs, not God’s. At their most basic, they aim to stem the use of force or fraud and to promote our material welfare. But such ends might be found in any human law. A divine law pursues two higher ends: to improve and perfect human character, and to foster the perfection of human reason (<italic>Guide</italic>, II 40, III 27), allowing us to realize the inner affinity to God alluded to in the biblical figure portraying all humans, male and female, as created in God’s image (Gen. 1:27). The Torah pursues its moral aim through character-building ordinances—paradigmatically, the command to help an enemy reload his fallen ass, designed, the Rambam writes, to help us curb our natural penchant for irascibility. Ritual laws like Sabbath observance direct us toward spiritual/intellectual perfection. For symbols foster beliefs that point toward higher truths. Thus, without dogmatism, they open a window on transcendence even for those unready for pure, conceptual thinking.</p>
      <p>In a brief section of the Mishnah Commentary called the Eight Chapters, introducing the tractate known as Precepts of the Fathers, Maimonides finds occasion, in the tractate’s normative thrust, to read the Torah’s prescriptions as laying out a virtue ethic meant to guide us toward the ultimate goal of knowing God. Moral clarity provides the substrate of such intellectual fulfillment of our God-given potential: subservience to our appetites and passions only clouds or blocks the divine afflatus. Anger, pride, or concupiscence is seen scripturally to impede even prophetic inspiration. But sheer asceticism is also a risk, not least when foolish people, eager to emulate the moral or social correctives of spiritual virtuosi, overcompensate, imagining that if a little medicine is healthful, higher doses must be all the more so.</p>
      <p>Free will, Maimonides stresses, is an axiom of the Law “never denied in our tradition, thank God!” (<italic>Guide</italic>, III 17). Sabbaths, as Jacobs notes, are the emblem of the freedom that links humanity with divinity (65, quoting <italic>Guide</italic>, II 30). Our choices may diminish our degrees of freedom, Maimonides explains, as Pharaoh’s were diminished by his escalating commitment to policies he’d freely chosen. But freedom, Jacobs writes, is of the essence in the covenant idea—a point that Kant elided in his eagerness to make Judaism a foil of true morality: “He failed to recognize the way in which Jewish thought is strongly aspirational in that the commandments are to be understood in terms of imparting holiness to all that one does and imparting holiness is understood in terms of the imitation of God, whose holiness is without limit” (139).</p>
      <p>The interpenetration of theism with ethics is the bright thread uniting Jewish thinkers in every period—from God’s command in Leviticus (19:18) to love one’s fellow as oneself down to and beyond Levinas’s breach with Heideggerianism over the primacy of ethics. Ethical and spiritual themes interpret one another throughout the Talmud and in Philo (ca. 25 <sc>BCE</sc> to 50 <sc>CE</sc>), the first Jewish philosopher. The theme holds steady in the Hebraic equation of the saint (<italic>tzaddik</italic>) with the generous and upright person, of charity with justice (<italic>tzedakkah</italic>), and piety with grace, favor, and loving kindness (<italic>hesed</italic>)—the gateway to the calls to supererogation built into Judaic law.</p>
      <p>In the traditional sources, these equations reflect ideas of covenant and blessedness that extend in two directions: toward God and toward other human beings, and (like God’s love and covenant) toward all creation. Maimonides formalizes these relations in Neoplatonic terms, noting that the angels on Jacob’s ladder, which Maimonides interprets as human prophets, descend after ascending—to share what they’ve received (<italic>Guide</italic>, I 15). Human beings, naturally drawn to love and awe of God, emulate God’s generosity when they share their gifts, imparting to others the material, moral, and intellectual means to self-sufficiency. The same themes persist through many a paradigm shift—as when Spinoza equates <italic>pietas</italic> with <italic>humanitas</italic>. As Jacobs writes, “for Maimonides and others who understood Judaism philosophically, love supervenes on knowledge.” Metaphysical realism here stands side by side with moral realism, forging a firm link between Athens and Jerusalem (24–25).</p>
