<plain_text><page sequence="1">Emhab versus the tmrhtn. Monomachy and the Expulsion of the Hyksos David Klotz (Tafel 20-22) Abstract New translation of the Emhab Stela (JE 49566) based on new photographs and an epigraphic copy. A close examination of the inscription shows that while Emhab did not participate in any theatrical performances or drum competitions, he was an important Upper Egyptian official in the late-Seventeenth to early-Eighteenth Dynasties and possibly engaged in monomachy against a Hyksos champion. Parallels from contemporaneous monuments, particularly from Edfu, demonstrate further that the Emhab Stela is surprisingly quite normal if viewed within its proper historical context. « La solidité d'Emheb rassurait le jeune roi. Au cours de ces dures années de lutte, jamais le gouverneur n'avait émis la moindre plainte, jamais il n'avait cédé au découragement. » Christian Jacq, La guerre des couronnes, 327. The deceptively simple stela of Emhab from Edfu (Cairo JE 49566) contains a large number of difficult passages which scholars have translated in drastically different ways.1 The first editor, Drioton, only published short excerpts of the autobiographical text he believed could support his colorful interpretation:2 Voilà qui nous introduit d'un seul coup dans un monde jusqu'à présent insoupçonné, mais qu'il est facile d'imaginer, tant il est éternel dans les campagnes de tous les pays. Les mimes ambulants réunissant le soir, ou les jours de fête, les villageois sur une place ou dans une maison, dansant, chantant, jouant même quelque drame à effet de leur répertoire, existaient en Egypte sous la Xlle dynastie comme de nos jours. * The author would like to thank John C. Darnell for providing many valuable suggestions regarding this stela, first during a seminar on biographies from the First and Second Intermediate Periods, and later in sub- sequent discussions.

Roeder, Die ägyptische Religion in Texten und Bildern II: Mythen und Legenden um ägyptische Gottheiten und Pharaonen, Zürich (u.a.) 1960, 89, included Emhab as an example of an ancient Egyptian performer.</page><page sequence="2">2J_2 D. Klotz S AK 39 For Drioton, Emhab was the only known example of an ancient Egyptian roving mime who imitated the steps of the protagonist (sms nb=fr nmtw.t=f), played the role of a ruler (iw=i m hqì) while his boss pretended to be a god (sw m ntr). Vikentiev quickly noted problems with Drioton's thesis, stressing Emhab's important administrative titles and the historical impli- cations of the rest of the stela.3 Nonetheless, Drioton later defended his initial interpretation and summarized the entire inscription as a rags-to-riches story:4 Entrant ensuite dans le détail des faits, Emheb raconte d'abord l'incident, avantageux pour lui, qui fut à l'origine de sa carrière. Les employés de son maître lui avaient remis un sac en lui demandant de calculer sa contenance en grains de blé: il soutint victorieusement l'épreuve en estimant sa capacité a 37.000 grains (lignes 5-8). Ce succès attira sur lui l'attention de son maître. Celui-ci lui confia alors le mission de battre le tam-tam (lignes 8-9), non pas que cette occupation requît en soi beaucoup d'intelligence, mais parce que l'annonce des representations à coups de grosse caisse s'accompagnait sans doute de proclamations et de plaisanteries, dans lesquelles il fallait faire montre d'un esprit déluré et subtil. Au bout de trois ans de cet exercise, Emheb, passé maître dans l'art du boniment, était capable d'affronter le public comme acteur (...) Emheb indique ensuite (ligne 12) le vaste champ des tournées dramatiques qu'il fit avec son maître. Il était allé vers le sud jusqu'au pays de Myou à l'extrémité de la Nubie, et vers le nord jusqu'à la ville d'Avaris, reconquise depuis peu sur les Hyksos. Le bas de l'inscription est brisé. In this imaginative reconstruction, Emhab's ability to estimate grain quantities led to his first job as a drummer in public performances, but it was his incredible acting talent that made him a famous mime who toured the Egyptian countryside. Vikentiev once again criticized Drioton's fantastical summary,5 and fifteen years later Cerny published the first handcopy and translation of the entire stela,6 demonstrating the absurdity of Drioton's original interpretation:7 As can be seen from the translation kept as literal as possible there is little if anything to support the interpretation according to which Emhab and his master were itinerant artists who travelled from place to place acting, singing and playing music. (...) We must also consider whether it is likely that a 'hereditary noble', count and 'high steward' and his master, whoever this is, would have travelled through Egypt and Nubia from town to town entertaining common folk. After Cerny reasonably argued that the Emhab stela represents in essence a fairly ordinary autobiography of a high-ranking Egyptian official, Baines subsequently revisited the text with a new interpretation reminiscent of Drioton's mime and drummer story: The stela contains the only known account of what seems to be a drumming contest (...) The hint whom Emhab defeated appears thus to be a contestant for the position of drummer. If so, aspiring members of the elite might compete for prestigious posts. Could Egyptian officials really attain important administrative positions like "Chief Steward" because of their drumming or acting skills, or are these honorary musical titles such as "Count" Basie or "Duke" Ellington?9 In order to reach this conclusion about the drumming contest, Baines assumed certain phrases were otherwise unattested musical termini technici - V.

However, this word appears only after the supposed contest, and therefore there is no reason to assume that the qmqm has anything to do with what precedes it.11 A. Grimm disputed the musical interpretation and argued that the stela recorded a death- match between Emhab and a Hyksos warrior.12 Vandersleyen attempted to reconcile Emhab' s titles and role of drummer by suggesting that he communicated long-distance military messages by beating on the "tam-tam."13 Goedicke, meanwhile, explained the text as a series of unin- troduced quotations of Emhab's lord which rallied Emhab to join the fight against the Hyksos.14 Nonetheless, the reading of Baines is still widely accepted,15 and Stork even defend- ed this interpretation by quoting lengthy passages of Ethiopian and Chinese literature des- cribing royal drummers.16 The erstwhile Count and Chief Steward of Edfu has been reduced to "a drummer boy in Kamose's forces."17 Recent presentations have helped to restore the Emhab stela to its historical and literary milieu, namely a document from the late Second Intermediate Period.18 However, a number of lexical problems have remained unsolved, and thus a new translation of the inscription is not entirely superfluous. A large problem facing all translators of the Emhab stela is the fact that the object has never been properly published. Drioton, Director of Antiquities at the time of the stela's dis- covery, only published typeset excerpts.19 Vikentiev presented epigraphic copies and photo- graphs of certain passages based on a photograph provided by Kuentz, 20 since by 1947 the stela 10 E.g. that qrf, "to bend, twist," would here denote agility "related to practice for drumming" (Baines, in: JEA 72, 1986, 42, n. h); wdi r=f, "to strike against," in the Emhab stela "must mean something like 'compete', with an implication of winning" (ibid., 43, n. 1); and iw, "length," here "would most suitably be a drumming fig- ure, but the general meaning is likely to be broader, a unit of iengtlr in music" (ibid., 43, n. m). 11 See already the remarks of Popko, Untersuchungen zur Geschichtsschreibung, 177: "Da die Aussagen von Zeile 8ff. sehr knapp gefaßt sind und einen anderen Stil als die übrigen Passagen haben, kann nicht eindeutig gesagt werden (...) ob das , Schlagen der Trommel' noch mit der vorhergegangenen Aussage verknüpft werden muß." Cf. also Goedicke, Studies about Kamose and Ahmose, 16, who noted that because of the switch from rhr.n sdm.n=fto sdm=f, the mention of the qmqm-ànxm "has to be taken as a unit not belonging to the narrative account." 12 A.

Klotz S AK 39 had temporarily vanished inside the basement of the Egyptian Museum.21 Cerny was unable to relocate the stela in 1959, and thus he based his handcopy on the same photograph used by Vikentiev.22 Nonetheless, while Cerny's copy was commendable given the circumstances, a comparison with the published photograph shows discrepancies between the handcopy and the awkardly executed Second Intermediate Period hieroglyphs. Since some of these differences could drastically effect the translation, it was deemed necessary to track down the stela and make a new copy.23 In June 2005, Ms. Sabah Abdelrazek located the stela in the basement of the Egyptian Museum and provided detailed photographs and measurements for the present study. In 2009, the Registrar's Office of the Egyptian Museum took additional photographs which appear in the present article (Taf. 20-22).24 Dimensions The maximum preserved height of the stela is 73 cm, and it measures 37.5 cm wide at the top but only 30 cm at the lowest preserved section. While the shape of the stela is unusual for Egyptian monuments, similar stela appear rather frequently at Nubian C-Group sites.25 Lunette Decoration (Taf. 20, fig. 2)26 Although Baines described the scene of Emhab as "crude in style and eccentric in execution,"27 the style, layout and carving quality are comparable to other non-royal stelae of the Second Intermediate Period, particularly those from Edfu.28 The winged sundisk has been compared a 21 Vikentiev, in: BFA 13, 1951, 32. 22 Cerny, in: MDAIK 24, 1959, 87, PL 13; this copy formed the basis for subsequent text editions: Helck, Historisch-biographische Texte der 2.

Vikentiev, in: BFA 16, 1954, 67-8, already noted that the Emhab stela is acually of much higher quality than contemporaneous Edfu stelae belonging to high officials.

The sign following imy-ri appears to be the snw.t sign (already noted by Vikentiev, in: BFA 10, 1948, 86- 7); however the lack of any holders of the title imy-ri snw.t wr, and the great frequency of the title imy-ri pr wr supports the latter reading (cf. already Cerny, in: MDAIK 24, 1959, 89, n. B); Helck, Historisch-biographische Texte der 2. Zwischenzeit, 97, already proposed the most reasonable reading of the sign: (for similar ortho- graphies, see the examples in W. Grajetzki, Die höchsten Beamten der ägyptischen Zentralverwaltung zur Zeit des Mittleren Reiches: Prosoprographie, Titel und Titelreihen, 2000, 88); the square, closed pr-sign may be influenced by Second Intermediate Period hieratic forms of the pr-sign and //-courtyard sign (04); cf. Möller, Hieratische Paläographie I, 17; J.C.

A), the phrase whm-rnh appears below the epithets of Horus due to lack of space; Goedicke's reading of the titles, "chief steward of his town" (BES 14, 2000, 20) requires too much perturbation to be likely. Morenz, in: Ägypten und Levante 15, 2005, 177, assumed that the phrase whm-rnh referred to Horus of Behedet, and then argued that such an epithet is unfitting for a deity and therefore must allude to the divinized Pharaoh. However, the parallel use of whm-rnh after Emhab' s name on line 3 strongly supports reading this epithet after his name in the caption. For the meaning of whm-rnh in this neriod see Kubisch LehenshilHer Her ? 7wkrhpn7p:it 196-7 36 Cerny, in: MDAIK 24, 1959, 89, n.

Klotz S AK 39 in festival."38 Emhab bears the title Chief Steward, one of the highest offices in the Egyptian administration primarily concerned with economic and agricultural affairs outside of the palace.39 On his left, Emhab is said to be "born of the lr.t-pc.t40 Biya (ms n iry.t-pr.t ByJ)"4{ Several scholars have suggested that Emhab was of foreign, even Nubian descent, based on the misreading of his mother's name as Bym42 However, the name Biya is actually quite common and most likely Egyptian.43 Emhab wears a long kilt and a collar,44 holds an rnh-sign with his right hand45 and a staff with his left.46 After close inspection of the photographs, it seems that Emhab is depicted with "sfumato eyes," a somewhat rare archaizing feature partially revived in the late Seventeenth to early Eighteenth Dynasties.47 On the right side stands "Horus of Behedet,48 Great God of his city (Hr Bhdty ntr rì n niw.t=ff and "Hathor Lady of Dendera {Hw.t-Hr nb.t 'Iwn.t)"49 the classical divine pair of 38 C.

Ranke, PN II, 217. 39 Grajetzki, Die höchsten Beamten, 79-115; for this title combined with the other titles of Emhab, iry-pr.t and hity-r' see ibid, 107; cf. also S. Quirke, Titles and bureaux of Egypt 1850-1700 BC, London 2004, 61-2. As Baines, in: JEA 72, 1986, 42, n. (b), noted, the title ity.t-pr.t is not very common in the Middle King- dom, and thus Emhab's mother must have wielded significant political influence; cf. also W. Ward, Essays on feminine titles of the Middle Kingdom and related subjects (Beirut 1986), 45-6, and 54, Nos. 2 and 3; D. Farout, Trois nouveaux monuments de la famille des gouverneurs d'Edfou à la deuxième période intermédiaire, in: RdE 58, 2007, 44, 48-9. As Farout has recently noted (ibid, 53), the large number of women from Edfu bearing the title iry.t-pr.t in the Second Intermediate Period indicates close familial ties to the Theban dynasty. According to D. Stefanovic, this title may specifically denote women of noble lineage (The non-royal regular feminine titles of the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period, 12-20). 41 Even though Cerny and all following translations have read this name as Bym, the aleph-vulture here is clearly distinguished from the m-owls represented throughout the stela by its crooked legs and pointed beak; this attestion of Bym or Bm is thus to be removed from Thirion's lists of revisions (M. Thirion, Notes d'onomastique. Contribution à une revision du Ranke PN [Dixième série], in: RdE 46, 1995, 180-1). 1 Goedicke, BAS 14, 2000, 19; Vandersleyen, in: Berger et al. (eds.), Hommages à Jean Leclant II, 402; Schneider, Ausländer in Ägypten, II, 114; note also that the hypothetical reading Bym would not necessarily signify Nubian ethnicity, since the name Bym is otherwise unattested in texts mentioning Nubians; such a name is absent, for example, from B. Gratien, Prosopographie des nubiens et des égyptiens en Nubia avant le Nouvel Empire, CRIPEL Supplément 3, 1991. Vikentiev, in: BFA 13, 1951, 17-23, also read Bym but argued for a Semitic origin. 43 Ranke, PN I, 93, 7-14 (with variants); E. Graefe, Untersuchungen zur Wortfamilie bji-, Köln 1971, 81.

Vernus, Réfections</page><page sequence="7">2010 Emhab versus the tmrhtn 217 Edfu.50 The names and epithets of these are inverted, reading right to left.51 Horus holds an rnh- sign in one hand, while Hathor carries nothing and holds both arms at her side.52 Horus of Behedet stands on a sr/z-stylized platform and holds a w;te-scepter which elevates an rnh-sign to his face. As Baines recognized, this is most likely a variation on the common representation of a deity elevating an 'Vz/j-sign to the Horus name of a pharaoh.53 In the current instance, however, the scene is abbreviated, as Horus of Edfu offers the rnh-sign to the "Falcon atop the serekh," which in this case happens to be himself.54 In front of Horus is an offering table with two tall bread loaves beneath and a pintail duck on top.55 Excursus: The Nationality of Emhab Vandersleyen dedicated an entire article to Emhab' s supposed Nubian heritage, based entirely on the assumption that only Nubians played the qmqm-drum (cf. infra)56 This statement is simply false, as Egyptians also appear in reliefs with this particular instrument.57 Vandersleyen also compared Emhab's nick-name Tmrrw to the famous Nubian soldier Tjehemau,58 but the et adaptations de l'idéologie monarchique à la Deuxième Période Intermédiaire: La stele d'Antef-le-victorieux, in: P. Der Manuelian (éd.), Studies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson II, 1996, 830, Fig. 1. 50 Baines, in: JEA 72, 1986, 52, suggested that the Emhab stela presents the earliest attestation of Hathor s journey from Dendera to Edfti as well known from Graeco-Roman inscriptions. However, priests of Hathor are attested at Edfu already in the Old Kingdom (G. Gabra, Zwei Stelenfragmente aus Edili, in: GM 75, 1984, 7) and the Middle Kingdom (Alliot, in: BIFAO 37, 1937-1938, 101); for a priest of "Hathor within Behedet" at Edfu in the early New Kingdom (reigns of Ahmose - Amenhotep I), see G. Gabra, The Site of Hagar Edili as the New Kingdom Cemetery of Edili, in: CdE 52, 1977, 219-20, fig. 7. 51 The same phenomenon occurs on the similar stela BM 1645, as noted by Vernus, in: Der Manuelian (ed), Studies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson II, 833, n. d. Morenz, in: Ägypten und Levante 15, 2005, 178-9, claimed the position of Hathor' s arms alludes to a "spezifisches rituelles Agieren der Hathor im Zuge einer Übergangszeremonie'' (ibid., 179); however, a cursory glance at stelae from the Middle Kingdom and later shows that women appear frequently in precisely this manner with no apparent religious connotations; e.g. W.K. Simpson, Terrace of the Great God at Abydos: the offering chapels of Dynasties 12 and 13, PPYE 5, New Haven 1974, Pis. 17 (= ANOC 8.2), 46-7 (= ANOC 30.1- 3), 51 (= ANOC 33.1), 57 (ANOC 39.1-2); HTBM IV, Pis. 18-20, 27, 30, 32, 42; HTBM V, Pis. 2, 17, 19; HO.

Contrast the relief fragment of MMA 08.200.6 (= Spieser, Les noms du Pharaon, 380, No. 303A), where an anthropomorphic Horus of Edfu holds an rnh-sign to a separate falcon upon the serekh. The object on top is definitely not the inverted mnh.t-doth sign, as Baines, in: JEA 72, 1986, 51, suggest- ed; the figure of the duck is already clear on photograph published by Cerny, and it appears correctly in the sketch by Vikentiev, in: BFA 13, 1951, 19, Fig. 2. Similar depictions of ducks with both legs pointed directly up- wards are not uncommon: e.g. MMA 12.183.8 = Hayes, The Sceptre of Egypt I, 140, fig. 82; H.

Klotz S AK 39 names are only similar in that they both begin with a dental and contain a medial m. This comparison is not sufficient to suggest a Nubian ethnicity for Emhab, especially since his nick- name name is attested for Egyptians already in the Old Kingdom (cf. infra, line 3). Morenz recently adopted the theory of Vandersleyen, suggesting further that Emhab may have been a Nubian prince {hql)' "der auf Seiten des Ka-mose kämpfte und der seinen ägyptischen Namen vielleicht sogar im Rahmen einer Art Taufe während eines Horusfestes eventuell von Ka-mose selbst verliehen bekam. Allerdings muß dies eine - wenn auch reizvolle - Vermutung bleiben."59 As attractive as this hypothesis might be, there is no evidence that Emhab was actually Nubian, or that such baptisms ever took place during festivals of Horus. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Nubian chiefs joined Kamose in his campaign against Kerma. On the contrary, Emhab bears an Egyptian name, probably an Egyptian nick-name, his mother has an Egyptian name (Biya), Emhab carries no titles or designations associated with Nubia, and he is depicted in completely Egyptian fashion. All these factors suggest Emhab was Egyptian, likely belonging to the local aristocracy of Edfu. The Inscription Introduction The main inscription contains a number of orthographic irregularities some of which can be found on other Edfu stelae from the late Middle Kingdom or Second Intermediate Period. Several signs are closer to their hieratic equivalents:60 Î for [} (lines 5, 6, 7, 14, 16),61 1 for 1 (line 7),62 9 for m (Ime 15).63 Other hieroglyphic signs are written in a moderately unusual fashion: ^ o _n ft ) W for Vô ' (Lunette, line 3),64 Vi for V (lines 4, 8, 11, 15),65 IM for a (lines 5, 7, 9, 12),66 A for X (lines 5 and 9),67 Ä for A (lines 7-8),68 and &lt;M for AÌÌ (line 15)69 59 Morenz, in: Ägypten und Levante 15, 2005, 180 (italics mine). 60 For other hieratic signs in the Edfu stele, cf. Alliot, in: BIFAO 37, 1937-38, 109, n. 8, 1 10, n. 2; el-Sayed, in: BIFAO 79, 1979, 185-6, n. (bf); P. Vernus, À propos de la fluctuation/?//; in: J. Osing/G.

Pétrie, Koptos, 1896, pl. 8, line 8. 64 Cerny and all other editions transcribed the sign as the Heb-Sed hieroglyph (W4), but it appears rather to be the composite hry-hlb(.i) group (W5) used to write hlb' for this use, see H.G. Fischer, Egyptian Studies III: Varia Nova, 1996, 209, n. 255; cf. also the similar writing of Sobekemhab on a Buhen stela (Khartoum 5320 = J.W.B. Barns, Four Khartoum Stelae, in: Kush 2, 1954, 19, 11. 1 and 7). 65 For similar versions of the /zr-face, cf. Fischer, Varia Nova, 190; another example of the /zr-face on the nearly contemporaneous Edfu stela BM 1645, line 1, resembles the present orthography more closely (HTBM VI, PI. 28; Vernus, in: Der Manuelian (ed.), Studies in Honor of William Kelly Simpson II, 830, Fig. 1). 66 Morenz, in: Ägypten und Levante 15, 2005, 172 and 177, suggested this particular orthography may have had an "ikonische Beziehung" to the figure of Emhab on the lintel. However, the two figures are in completely different poses (one striking with both arms, the other holding a staff with one arm), moreover similar ortho- graphies of the striking man appear on other Edfu stele (e.g. BM 1645, lines 3 and 4 = HTBM VI, PI. 28).</page><page sequence="9">2010 Emhab versus the tmrhtn 219 Grammar The inscription exhibits a number of Late Egyptianisms found in other texts from the late Second Intermediate Period, such as the Kamose Stelae and the Karnak Juridical Stela.70 These features include the use of piy=i to denote possession (lines 10 and 15), the use of sw instead of iw=f'm an initial adverbial phrase (line 10), and the construction wnn=fhr sdm, iw=i hr sdm (line 11).

Rather, it refers to curvature of the limbs, cramps, wrinkles, or even to the effects of rigor mortis.95 As such, it qualifies something as unnaturally and negatively bent,96 and thus it cannot mean "strength" or "agility." As the word qrf is not very common,97 one could compare the nearly synonymous verb rr/"to tie/bind together."98 This verb is applied to enemies or foreign lands, who are often described as "bound together (rrf.w) in (the King's) fist (/*/").""

Peust, "rdj + Pseudopartizip - eine mögliche Konstruktion," in: GM 211, 2006, 67-70); nonetheless, one would expect to find a subjunctive ("I caused that all agents become bound (rdi.n=i qrfrwd.w a?6)"), or simply a transitive use of qrf ("I bound all the agents (qrfn=i rwd.w nb)T 93 Redford alternatively suggested to read "nb qrf 'owner of the bag': i.e. the wealthy person," (Redford, in: Oren, ed., The Hyksos, 29, n. 101); Drioton, in: Revue de la Société d'Histoire du Théâtre 6, 1954, 38, similarly read this word as qrf "sack of grain," the contents of which Emhab estimated correctly. 94 Goedicke, Studies about Ahmose and Kamose, 8; cf. also H. von Deines/W.

However, the translation "strength" 101 is impossible because of the plural strokes, while "strong men" or "Starken" are never referred to as rwd. w. Only A. Grimm suggested (in a text note) that this word might be the administrative title rwd "agent."102 Although the duties of the rwd-agent varied,103 he was primarily involved in military and economic affairs, often collecting taxes.104 It is quite fitting, then, that the rwd.w would present what they had rounded up (qrf) to Emhab, their Chief Steward.105 (c) Cerny and Baines did not comment on this foreign word, and A. Grimm only stated that it was a "Personennamen."106 Vikentiev assumed this was a Semitic name, elaborately com- bining Hebrew and Egyptian words (nti m yrh htn.P=i "he who is in yrh of my htnf)m Goedicke, meanwhile, separated this into seven separate Egyptian words.108 Cerny read dd.n.ti for dd.n.tw, "one said," while noting that this would be an unusual archaism since such a spelling is extremely rare even in the Old Kingdom.109 Goedicke went further and understood "one spoke" as an oblique reference to Kamose.110 Next, Cerny pro- posed to read my as "a unique but hardly surprising" orthography of the imperative "come!"111. A. Grimm assumed this was a name "dessen Lesung eventuell Tmjrhtnt lautet."112 Vikentiev had also originally noted the name would appear to read tmrtn,U3 while both Morenz and 101 Baines, in: JEA 72, 1986, 42; followed by Hannig, Ägyptisches Wörterbuch II, 1467. 102 A. Grimm, in: JEA 75, 1989, 220-1, n. c, explained his translation: '"die Starken' in der Bedeutung 'die Beauftragten, die Vertreter, o.a.'"; Goedicke, Studies about Kamose and Ahmose, 8-9, further suggested that the word 'denotes people suitable for military service," even though he admitted "the term a priori has no military connotations." 103 For the role of the nvd-agent in the Pharaonic period, see primarily J.-M. Kruchten, L'évolution de la gestion dominiale sous le nouvel empire égyptien, in: E. Lipinski (ed), State and Temple Economy in the Ancient Near East II, OLA 6, Leuven 1979, 517-22; and recently J.C.

Goedicke, Studies about Kamose and Ahmose, 10-11; Goedicke's suggestion that the last phrase could be read "the killer of my father," understanding hti, "drill" as a reference to "the piercing hole from which Seqenenre', i.e. Kamose's father, died." (ibid., 11) is untenable, as Seqenenre was most likely killed with mul- tiple wounds inflicted by Syro-Palestinian MB II battleaxes, not drills (cf. M. Bietak/ E. Strouhal, Die Todes- umstände des Pharaos Seqenenre' (17. Dynastie). Vorbericht, in: Annalen des Naturhistorischen Museums Wien 78, 1974, 29-52).

Pushkin 127 P. Cairo CG 30865 It is not impossible that all these orthographies represent the same word. The basic elements of both are TMRHTN and TMRGN, and thus the main difference is the ht of Emhab and the g of the later examples. If the combination of rh in Emhab is an early attempt to represent the foreign r-sound represented by rw in the other words,119 the differences reduce to a t/t versus g. If this were indeed the same word, the earlier could represent the Upper Egyptian pronunciation (Edfu), while the g of pPushkin would indicate the Lower Egyptian pronunciation (Heliopolis). This dialectical phenomenon is apparent in Modern Egyptian Arabic (i.e. Saridi: jebel vs. Cairene: gebel), as it was in Coptic, where dialects also vary between x and &lt;s.120 Although the exact meaning of tmrgn is unclear,121 Caminos suggested "a warrior or soldier of a special class,"122 and compared its seated-child determinative with that of dimw "recruit" 113 Vikentiev, in: BFA 13, 1951, 25. Morenz, in: Ägypten und Levante 15, 2005, 173, n. 24. 115 Popko, Untersuchungen zur Geschichtsschreibung, 175, n. 61. Since the terminal -t in feminine words was no longer pronounced in this stage of Egyptian, it is unclear whether the final / in this word actually represents a true t sound or a final hi. Note, however, that the other examples of Ixl in the Emhab stela are written with the //-hieroglyph. 117 P. Pushkin 127, r° V, 5; R Caminos, A Tale of Woe from a Hieratic Papyrus in the AS.

Hintze, Ein altes afrikanisches Wort für 'Elefant,' in: Meroitica 10, 1988, 620); one might also compare the complicated case of the loan word for "'pomegranate," spelled both inhmni and inmni, which corresponds to Sumerian nu.ur2ma and Nuzi nurumu; cf.

Teymurchin), possibly related to modern Turkic timur-gi, "iron worker."133 The Turkic word for iron, timur,134 features prominently in the name Brief, in: ZÄS 128, 2001, 180, n. 125); D.

As Cerny already noted, the grammar of the tmrhtn(tys statement ("I shall fight against him") is similar to the demand of Sinuhe's Asiatic opponent: "he said that he would fight with me."143 Sinuhe claims to be surprised by the hostilities of the "strongman (nht)"144 of Retjenu, but their fight is a good example of monomachy. This type of one-on-one combat was a form of warfare particularly popular in the 134 In modern Turkic languages, the word for "iron" varies: demir (Turkish, Turkmen, Azerbaijani), temir (Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek), timer (Tatar) and tömür (Uighur) (K. Oztopcu, et al., A Dictionary of the Turkic Languages, 1996, 80); the word is already attested in Old Turkic (c. 750-1300 AD) as tämir: A. von Gabain, Alttürkische Grammatik3. Porta Linsuarum Orientalium. Neue Serie 15. 1974. 369 135 F. Wolff, Glossar zu Firdosis Schahname, 1935, 399; F. Justi, Iranisches Namenbuch, 1895, 82, already noted that this name ''scheint türk. demir, mongol, temür (Eisen) zu sein." Ferdowsi introduces this character as follows: "There was a well-known warrior called Damur, a man unequalled for his strength among the Turks." (translation of D. Davis, The Legend of Seyavash, 1992, 96) 136 W.L. Moran, The Amarna Letters. Baltimore (et al.) 1992. 57. n. 7. 137 A. Gardiner, Tut'ankhamun's iron dagger, in: JEA 28, 1942, 1; N.

Drews has convincingly demonstrated the problems with the traditional interpretation of V. Gordon Childe, in which Anatolian warlords and their revolutionary iron weapons are responsible for the ''Sea Peoples," (R. Drews, The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C., 1993, 73-6). Nonetheless, even if iron weapons did not lead directly to 'the Catastrophe," it cannot be denied that a con- siderable number of iron prestige goods and weapons are attested textually and archeologically in Anatolia; cf.

Such an episode would be perfectly reasonable in the context of the Theban-Hyksos war. (d) The interpretation of this phrase is difficult for several reasons, not least of which is the unusual group *ìmd, which Cerny and all subsequent translators transcribed as i&amp; 1. Ì. Since the sign on the Emhab stela only vaguely resembles the ^w-hieroglyph,146 one might also consider reading Skm, m wrrw, "one on one,"147 or ätt?, m-sìh.w, "up close."148 However, the latter two options would make little sense in the second occurrence of this sign on line 9. Regarding the phrase m-iw, Baines claimed that "the context suggests a technical term in music,"149 but this assertion presupposes that this section describes a drumming contest. In its most literal sense, this phrase would simply mean "at length" or "in extenso" as translated by Goedicke. Alternatively, the phrase m-iw could also be synonymous with r-iw, "completely," as in the following passage from the Cairo Calendar: "then he slaughtered them completely (rhr smln=f sn m-?w)."150 A. Grimm identified this phrase with the expression m-iw, "to be deceased," which is fairly common in the late Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period,151 and thus appropriate for the present context as well. (e) There may be a subtle phonetic pun here on the final htn of the name tmrhtn and the phrase "I defeated" (hd.n=i). 145 W.K. Pritchett, The Greek State at War, IV, 1985, 15-21; H.A.

Grimm alternatively suggested reading 30,000 or 40,000, based on the multiplication shorthand whereby )| '■ would write 10,000 times 3.152 However, a closer examination of Egyptian mathematical notation reveals that this is unlikely, as (1) the multiplier should be written beneath the ¿/¿r-sign;153 (2) only numbers greater than 30,000 were written with this notation, since 20,000 and 30,000 would appear as Si and SIS;154 and finally (3), as Sethe noted, "in die hieroglyphischen Texte scheint diese Schreibweise nicht Eingang zu haben."155 Goedicke objected to Cerny's transcription, claiming that fingers would be "a highly unlikely form of belligerent challenge to war."156 Instead, he suggested that the sign in question is actually a battle axe.157 This hypothesis is somewhat intriguing, especially since the shape of this sign would resemble the "lugged, asymmetrical forms,"158 a type of axe particularly asso- ciated with Kamose, Ahmose, the Ahhotep cache and the late Seventeenth Dynasty.159 In addition, Sinuhe delivers the coup de grâce to his Asiatic opponent with a mmè-axe,160 which could further enhance the similarities between Emhab and Sinuhe (cf. supra). Nonetheless, there is no reason why the "axe-sign" would be reversed, while the finger hieroglyph normally does point to the left.161 Stork and Baines understood these "fingers" to be a reference to Emhab's drum-playing.162 While such an expression might make sense for the darabukka, the qmqm-drum would have been played with the entire hand.163 In addition, the qmqm-drum is not mentioned until the next section, and there is no reason to assume that the events are related. A much simpler reading would understand this phrase literally "with (my) fingers" meaning "with my own hands," or "by my own agency."164 This would be a simple variant of the phrase m dr.ty(=sn' "by their agency" used earlier in the stela (line 5). Contrary to the assumptions of Goedicke, fingers are in fact mentioned elsewhere as the agent of violent attacks.165 The word 152 A. Grimm, in: JEA 75, 1989, 222, n. g. 153 K.

Klotz S AK 39 choice might be particularly relevant, as the finger had a powerful apotropaic significance,166 perhaps suitable to the bellicose actions of Emhab against his opponents. There is also a derived verb dbr "to point the finger at; to accuse."167 (g) The phrase iw.w is understood here as a stative result clause.168 The withdrawal of 7,000 troops after the defeat of the tmrhtn(i) would further support the interpretation of traditional monomachy mentioned above, where a battle of two champions took place instead of a longer and more destructive battle. The number 7,000 as used here clearly belongs to the destructive symbolism of the number seven in ancient Egyptian thought.169 A similar apotropaic example occurs in the "Destruction of Mankind" in which the rage of Hathor-Sakhmet is appeased only through 7,000 jugs of beer.170 Three Years as a Drummer (II 8-12, , Taf. 22b) Drioton: "(...)

(c) The word qmqm, "drum," is elsewhere always associated with Hathoric celebrations, and not with military actions.173 In Coptic, the nearly homophonous kmkm (koykm)174 and 6n6n (xnxn)175 both mean "drum" as well as "to strike a drum."176 While all previous translators have translated sh.t m qmqm as "playing the drum," only Cerny has commented on the unexpected m between sh.t and qmqm}11 While the m could serve as a direct-object marker,178 the determinative (a man playing the qmqm-drum) would apply better to a drummer rather than a drum.179 A similar case exists in P. Sallier IV, r° 4.1, where the word shr/shlt, which usually means "drum," designates the festival drummer himself,180 and thus one could also translate: "I spent three years striking as a drummer." Similar cylinder- shaped drums, 181 although nowhere else specifically called qmqm, appear quite often in reliefs of the New Kingdom and later. 182 In many of these examples, the drummers, usually together with trumpeters, accompany troops in military celebrations such as the Opet Festival.183 Little else is known about the function of military musicians, although their existence can at least be inferred from the grouping of singers (smr.w) with soldiers also Urk.

One makes music for her with the drum (nhm.tw n=s m qmqm) on this day." Another example comes from a hymn to Mut-Hathor (W. Spiegelberg, Hieratic Ostraka from Thebes, in: Ancient Egypt 1, 1914, 1 10; noted by Cerny, in: MDAIK 24, 1969, 90-1, n. K); the only Demotic examples occur in P.

In a religious setting, drums had an apotropaic significance, which may explain their connection to Bes and Anubis.191 Similarly, the qmqm-drummev directly precedes the divine bark during the Opet Festival,192 perhaps to create apotropaic noise to defend the bark during its potentially dangerous journey.193 Furthermore, the phrase shi m qmqm bears a striking resemblance to Demotic shy/syh n qnqn, "Kampfpartner; Kampfesgegner," especially since the latter phrase is a technical term for a dueling opponent.194 The word qmqm "drum" is similar to the violent words qnqn "to strike" and gmgm "to smash,"195 and all three are probably related to Coptic kmkm and ¿nsn, "to play the drum" mentioned above. 184 0.

The intransi- tive use of hdb employed here is distinctive, since it finds parallels only in the story of Sinuhe (B 62) and the Wadi el-Hol literary inscription, both texts describing a (semi)-divine military king.206 While the concept of the king slaying enemies had a long tradition in Egyptian 196 For the range of meanings inherent in the verb stwt, cf.

This does not necessarily mean that he "resurrects" those slain by Kamose, nor that he "enlivens" the army through his drumming.210 Rather, Emhab stresses his administrative role of Chief Steward and hqi, the primary economic official responsible for distributing supplies. The particular deed of sustaining life (srnh) was highly esteemed by private officials, and features prominently in auto-biographies, particularly in the First and Second Intermediate Periods.211 Therefore, the entire time that Emhab' s lord waged war (wnn=f hr hdb), Emhab provided economic support and sustained the population of Edfu.

Klotz S AK 39 (a) Although the location of Miw has been discussed on multiple occasions,212 a new look at a variety of sources may allow for a new identification. (i) Geographic Lists/Etymologies In a study of the Nubian itinerary of Juba, Priese suggested that Miw corresponds to Latin Emeum and Arabic Mãwãya, near Firka.213 However, he confounded two distinct toponyms: miw (always written miw)214 with m-w-i (sometimes written mì-wì-iì)2ì5 and it is the latter which most likely corresponds to Mãwãya. Much earlier, Zyhlarz had noted that Miw usually occurs in the series 'Itr, Itr-Miw, and Miw, as the three southernmost toponyms in Nubia, within the area of Punt.216 Assuming these toponyms lay in Eritrea, Zyhlarz identified Itr with modern day Adala, Itr-Miw with the Atalmo mentioned in the inscription of Kosmas Indikopleustes,217 and suggested Miw lay north of 'Itr- Miw. Alternatively, one might identify 'Itr with Adulis, near Massawah, and thus Itr-Miw and Miw would be somewhere to the north-west. (ii) The Armant Stela The location Miw occurs again in the Armant Stela of Thutmosis III,218 which narrates the hunting exploits of the king (11. 8-10):219 in.n=fsìqb m st.thr hìs.t rsy.t tì-Sti m-ht wdì=fr Miw r hhi btn sw m ß pf It was through archery that he brought back a rhinoceros from the southern hill-country of Nubia, after he had proceeded to Miw in order to chase the one who rebelled against him in that land. 212 Most recently: L.

One way of reaching these hunting lodges was via the Red Sea, where he also established a harbor. The ships left from Pithom, sailed through the canal system which connected Lake Timsah, the Bitter Lakes, and the Red Sea (collectively called Km-wr)223 until they reached Km-wr-Miw, written saToMÎ (line 22)224 and ^^M (line 24).225 While this phrase has been variously interpreted,226 the context of the Pithom Stela suggests that this toponym refers to a section of the Red Sea near Miw. Unlike the rhinoceros hunt Thutmosis III described on the Armant Stela, the elephant hunting of Ptolemy II is extremely well documented in classical sources, which allow one to con- fidently locate the hunting lodges north of Kassala, in the Khor Gash.227 Therefore Miw should also be somewhere in the same general vicinity.228 (b) The repeated sdm.n=f clauses (ph.n=i Miw ... ph.n=i Hw.t-wrr.t) should be understood as nominal,229 thus creating a Wechselsatz. The intermediate statement nn ip his.t nb must then be circumstantial ("without counting every foreign land"), rather than negative prospective.230 220 D. O'Connor, The Location of Irem, in: JEA 73, 1987, 116-7, n. 83; cf. also H.C. Brocklehurst, Game Animals of the Sudan: Their Habits and Distribution, 1931, 111. 221 Leaving aside the minor problem of whether Thutmosis hunted the rhinoceros in Miw itself, or further south: cf. the remarks of O'Connor, in: JEA 73. 1987. 122-4. 222 For the following, cf. J.C. Darnell/D. Klotz, The Pithom Stela and the Location of Ptolemais Theron (in preparation). 223 For the canal system proceeding from Lake Timsah to the Red Sea, and the route of Ptolemy II's fleet, see most recently Thiers, Ptolémée Philadelphe et les prêtres d'Atoum de Tiékou, 107-17, 125-9. 224 Thiers, Ptolémée Philadelphe et les prêtres d'Atoum de Tjékou, 67 and 68, n. (170), argued against reading the final sign as a cat, even though an identical orthography occurs on line 6 of the same stela, which Thiers, ibid, 24, transcribed as a cat. The parallelism with the clearly carved example on line 24 further supports reading Miw on line 22. 225 Cf. the photo and epigraphic copy in Thiers, Ptolémée Philadelphe et les prêtres d'Atoum de Tjékou, Pis. IV and VI. For line 22, Thiers, Ptolémée Philadelphe et les prêtres d'Atoum de Tjékou, 67, translated: wïl atteignirent Kem-Our, comme la fureur (du) ciel (mi nsn p.t) couvert des nuages."

In the beginning of this passage, one could simply restore the first-person suffix pronoun and read rhr.n szp.n(=ï) piy=i nb "and then I received my lord." The use of szp "to receive, to greet" is used more often for gods,234 but can refer to officials receiving the Pharaoh.235 Cerny transcribed the group of signs after nb as *S*J&amp; j^-^á, reading the name of a servant woman {Gm=i-{si-m)-sn*', lit. "I found (her at) the storehouse"), whom the king apparently purchased for Emhab as a reward.236 However, collation reveals that the second sign is definitely an aleph- vulture, while the supposed "seated lady" (Bl) is actually two separate signs (cf. infra), and thus there is no reason to discuss whether or not the king would barter for servants to reward his soldiers.237 The first sign is very unusual, and it only vaguely resembles the gm-bird (G28) which Cerny copied.238 It could also be a confused interpretation of the group 1'^ (ssm' perhaps influenced by a ligatured hieratic original.239 However, neither of these values (gm, ssm) would accord with the following aleph- vulture. This leaves two possibilities. (')rhr.nsspp]y=inbT]( ^ ME: ) "Then my lord received Ta(?)." The inward curving, keyhole-shaped sign closely resembles the hieratic form of the tf-kiln (U30),240 and the personal name "Ta" vaguely recalls the Nubian rebel "Aata" {ììtì) against whom Ahmose campaigned.241 However, the traces between the kiln and the vulture signs are difficult to explain. 234 Wb.

The left curve of the first sign would correspond to the rounded shield that appears in this hieroglyph already in the Middle Kingdom,242 while the traces to the left could be a misguided interpretation of the arms and mace. This sign was particularly difficult for scribes, and a number of unusual forms appear on private stelae.243 The phrase ssp rhl, "to begin fighting," is well attested from other inscriptions,244 and thus rhi is the most likely option. (b) Cerny transcribed the following sign as the ^r-plow (*£), and indeed the original photograph at first appears to support this reading. However, the new photographs show that the base actually curves upwards on the left side, while the top line curves downwards to meet the base as follows: ^?. Given the context, this sign is most likely the wing-hieroglyph (&lt;^), here writing rhi, "to fly."245 A shadow on the original photograph led Cerny to read the next group as n, but collation with the new photographs show this was actually a round sign over a viper. As a result, this section says nothing about a woman named Gemishena, but rather says that Emhab's lord "flew (rh=f)" (1^ or -L SÜ).246 The verb rhl/rhl, "to fly," often describes military actions of the king. When Sesostris I hears about the death of his father, his return to the capitol is described as follows: "the falcon flew back along with his followers (bik rh=fhnr sms.w=f)"241 Kamose, meanwhile, described the aquiline formation of his ships during the siege of Avaris, noting how they "flew upon the river like a falcon would (hr rh.t hr i{t)rw mi wn n bik)"24S (c) Only the top of this sign survives, and the original photogrpah shows three small diagonal strokes. Since the ^-hieroglyph always appears in the semi-cursive flat form elsewhere in the stela, Cerny transcribed the present example as three pieces of grain (f,*&gt;' However, since the three strokes appear to be joined, a simpler restoration is WÊk for mw, "water."249 (d) Cerny transcribed Si and read "one pot." However, the first sign appears to be the simple tfw-pot, here writing the plural indirect genitive.250 242 Gardiner, EG, 453 (D34). 243 For several examples, cf. HG. Fischer, The Orientation of Hieroglyphs, Part I. Reversals, Egyptian Studies 2, 1977, 145, n. (g); idem, Varia Nova, 103; JE 52456, line 6 (B.

There appears to be enough room below the book-roll to restore: [iw]=/, providing another example of the Late Egyptian first person pronoun (cf. supra, pp. 27-8, n. (e)). Conclusion A. Grimm had dubbed the Emhab stela one of "the most problematic and controversial of ancient Egyptian texts."251 However, most textual difficulties have arisen when translators approached the inscription out of context, forcing new meanings on words and expressions to make the text the only Egyptian account of a mime's career or drumming contest. Compared to contemporaneous stelae from Edfu, the epigraphic peculiarities of the Emhab stela become almost banal,252 while the grammatical irregularities correspond perfectly to other stelae of the late Seventeenth Dynasty,253 and certain passages strongly resemble quotes from the Kamose Stelae.254 Emhab's titles are not meaningless, but explicitly place him within the ruling class of Edfu which provided crucial support for the Theban dynasts in the end of the Second Inter- mediate Period.255 Emhab's claim to provide sustenance (srnh) for his people, in his administrative role of Chief Steward with control over tax-collecting rW-agents, resonates particularly well with the recent discovery of massive grain silos from the Seventeenth Dynasty at Edfu.256 In short, the Emhab stela corresponds nicely to other stelae of the Second Inter- mediate Period and discusses exactly what one might expect, namely the campaign against the Hyksos. Emhab narrates his battle against a mysterious figure called tmrhtn(t) which led to victory over 7,000 enemies, apparently after a bout of monomachy (lines 6-8). During the campaign against Kerma and Avaris, Emhab followed his lord in all places and at all times (lines 4 and 13), and even took the lead when his lord - most likely Kamose - began fighting in Lower Egypt (lines 15-16). In addition to his military bravery, Emhab provided economic support for Upper Egypt during the war (lines 10-11), sending tax agents to collect supplies and revenue (line 5). In the course of this short inscription, Emhab sketched a biography of an ideal regional administrator during a time of war. 251 A. Grimm, in: JEA 75, 1989, 220.
