<plain_text><page sequence="1">ICONOGRPAHY: WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE ICONOGRAPHY OF SHAKTA DEITIES OF VAITAL TEMPLE, BHUBANESWAR Jayanti Dora The study of images or iconography mainly concerns with the study of religious figures may be on stone, terracotta, bronze, painting on the coins, seals and on temple walls. In the words of J.N. Banerjea, the greatest authority on Hindu Iconography, this branch of knowledge is not merely concerned with the study and interpretation of the characteristics of the principal icons or images proper, which are enshrined in the main sanctum of a temple or church, but it also deals with the delineation of the special features and the understanding of the true significance of the figure sculptures, frescoes or such other objects which are executed on different parts of the shrine mainly for decorative purposes. Thus in broader sense, the term iconography really signifies the interpretative aspect of the religious art of a country which becomes manifest in diverse ways".1 A prominent feature of the Orissa temple is the depiction of cult images as Parsvadevatas in the principal niches of the temple as decorative motifs on the outer wall of the temple and ás presiding deity inside the sanctum of the temple. The affiliation of a temple to a particular sect can be detected through these images without entering into the sanctum. These images are subsidiary to and at the same time very closely associated to the presiding deities. The origin and evolution of the iconography in connection with the cult image can be determined from these images. It is in this context, the purpose of this article is to discuss an important aspect of the Orissan temples, the iconographical study of the Shakta deities of Vaital temple. The cult of the Mother Goddess is associated with the most ancient faiths and beliefs of human being all over the world. The divine mother is considered to be the source of energy or the Shakti itself. According to the primitive religious thought of human being all powers of creation, operation preservation and destruction vested in the hands of mother goddess, the mother goddess fulfills their relgious aspiration and they feel safe under her shade and shield. She is manifested in different names and frames which are evident from Shakta literature, Shakta temples and Shakta images found in different parts of India as well as Orissa.</page><page sequence="2">Archaeology 1225 The antiquity of Mother worship dates back at least to the 3rd millennium BC as evident from the discovery of scores of terracotta female figures from the Harappan settlements.2 Further antiquity of the cult is traceable from the prehistoric rock shelters wherein she is depicted in her anthropomorphic form. She was also invoked in different names in different periods like Usha Aditi during the vedic period, Adisķaktiy Mahashakti , Parashakti , Durga , Chandika , Chamunda , M aha Laxmi , Máha Sarswati , Iccha shakti , Kriya Shùkti and Jnana Shakti during the Epic and historical periods. The beginning of Shakti cult in Orissa may be traced to a very early age and Mother Goddess was worshipped with great veneration and love, by the primitive tribes like the Shavasras and the pulindas who were living in the Vindhyas as for as Mahendragiri in the southeastern part of Orissa.4 The Terasinga (in Kalahandi district) copper plate discloses that about the 4th 5th century AD a local king named Tushtikara was worshipping Stambheshvari , who is also known as Bhagavati? This is the earliest known record about the worship of Mother Goddess as ShtamSheshvari. Of the various form of Shakatism the cult of Shtambheshvari , cult of Mahisamardini cult of Sapta Matrikas, cult of Chausathi Yoginis , the Kapalika cult and the cult of Uma • Maheshvasra are the most popular cult flourished in Orissa. The important Shakta temples are found in Bhubaneshwar, Cuttack, Puri, Jajpur, Hirapur, Chaurasi, Bumapur, Ranipur Jharial, Belkhandi etc. The Vaital temple, the most artistic and earliest Shakta shrine is situated in the midst of the town Bhubaneshwar, presently the capital city of Orissa. The unique shrine stands on the way to the Lingaraj and in the western part, not far from Vindusoravara. It was constructed by the Bhauma ruler in the second half of the eighth century while Panigrahi dates the temple as C.775 AD.6 The name Vaital is derived from the word Vetal one spirit with the help of which the Kapalikas and the Tantrikas wanted to attend their Siddhis.1 The Kapalikas are the staunch worshippers of Kapalini who is a manifestation of Chamunda the presiding deity of the Vaital temple. Worship of Chamunda has been prescribed in various Sanskrit tantric texts. In chapter XXVII of the Shvarnadrimohadaya, it is stated that, "the venereable goddess Chamunda garlanded with skulls exists at spot on the west not far from the tank that is Vindusarovara and that she is of terrific form and is known as kapalini* There is also reference about human sacrifice by Kapalika to their presiding deity, Chamunda in the Yoshodharakavya of Vadiraja' S uri.9</page><page sequence="3">1226 IHC: Proceedings , 63rd Session, 2002 A close scrutiny of the Shakta shrines and monuments reveal that the Shilpis have evolved an altogether different scheme of art and architecture for Shakta shrines. The cannonical texts like Bhubanapradipa , Shilp apraka sha and Shlipa Ratnakosha are explicit in their prescription in respect of Shakta monuments while the Rekha and Pidha are dedicated to Shaiva and Vaishnava deities, Khakhara temple is exclusive for enshrining the Shakta deities. Unlike the Rekha and Pidha temple the Khakharea temple. has three varieties as described in the Bhubanapradipa. They are Dravira , Barabhi or Valabhi and Kosali. Among the three variety of Khakhara temples, the Valabhi type, characteried by a semi cylindrical roof resting on a frame work of rafter, olbong in plan and as use know from the Vishu dharmottara is designed to contain either a group of deities or singly a Durga or laxmi etc. The most distinguishing feature of this type of temple is its barrel vaulted elongated roof which faintly resembles a variety of local pumpkin known as Khakhara. The Vaital temple is in Khakhara style and is rectangular in plan. The Shikhara is a barrel vaulted structure (Figure 1). This temple is consisted of the main deul and the Jagamohana , striking both for its architectural design and applied art. Instead of the ratha projections, the bada has shallow pilasters, all on the same plane and most elegantly carved the effect being further heightened by the austerely plain recesses in between." The height of the temple is 35', Vimana inside H'x8' and outside 14'xl6'.12 On the longer side it has fine vertical rows of projections. Each of these rows contains a niche on the bada portion with the sculpture figure, human or divine are placed in it, while the uncarved plain recesses between the perpendicular rows of projections introduced contrast on the design. The baranda consists of two projecting mouldings separated by a recess and filled with various figure motifs. Each scene separated from one another by thin pilasters. The scene carved there are such as, Mithunas , figures leaning on a shaft, standing female figures, inebriated men supported by female figures and Kapalikas. In the Hindu cosmogony gods are considered as the "Lords of Karma " and the goddess are considered as their inseparable power on source of energy. Thus Brahma has the goddess Sarasvati. (The goddess of learning or speech) dwelling in his mouth. She presides over learning and is the vach, logos (word) which essentially is the first cause of creation. So is Shri or Laxmi, the consort of Vishnu, the presiding goddess of wealth and happiness, and hence also the energy that sustains or keeps the world going. Shivas consort Parvate or Uma like wise especially in her manifestation as Kali , is the energy</page><page sequence="4">Archaeology 1 227 that destroys, that makes the world evolves or draw itself into the quiescent state from which is started or evolved.13 In fact a sect of worshippers called Shaktas , "the adherents of Shakti or energy" affirm that this Shakti , the feminine element in god, is the sole cause of all visible phenomena. Almost every human or divine activity has been personified as a goddess. This theory of goddesses has pervaded even Jainism and Buddhism, the latter especially in its, Mahayana development. The true Shakti worshippers do not make any distinction of caste and creed. Perhaps it was thus that Shakti as faith became one of the compromises providing a common meeting ground for the different form of religion prevailing in India.14 Shakti may be found depicted in temples in any one of the three aspects, the calm; the terrible or the ugly, as distinguished by the particular position in which they are placed or the circumstances under which they are worshipped when merely represented as the consorts of the gods they are mild and pleasing in appearance and have only two hands, in one of which is held the lotus bud. More often however mere, the goddesses have independent existence. The majority of these latter are Saivite in their nature i.e. wild, fearful and destructive and are often propitiated only by bloody sacrifices.15 It must be noteci that the characteristic feature in the worship of Shakti , whether Shaivite , Vaishnavite or otherwise is the association with them of mystic charms, or geometrical figures called Chakras , Yantras or Pithas , with conventional and often mystic incarnations and no appeal to the gentler feelings of the human nature. The study of images in Vaital temple will show the amalgamation of Shaktism , Shaivism and Mahayana Buddhism in a very strange manner. The presiding deity of the temple is a Chamunda , malevolent, form of Parvati, consort of lord Siva. The temple bears images like Haraparvati , Andhanarishwara , Lakulisha tantric Mahayana images like Amoghasidha and Shakta images like Chamunda Mahisamardini and Saptamatrikas. In addition to the sculpting of specific deities, Shakta influence is also evident in the overall iconographie programme of the temple, particularly in the addition of alasa kanyas in niches or recesses. The influence is so great, infact, that the images of women dominates the decorative programme of the temple, particularly the upper Jangha , where she is either depicted alone or in the company of the male partner in mithuna motifs. In an upper niche of the raha of the gandi on the north side, the figure of a four armed Parvati is found. She is seated in Padmasana with a lion on her right and a deer on her left side. Her major right</page><page sequence="5">1228 IHC : Proceedings , 63rd Session , 2002 hand is in Varada , displaying a lotus mark on the palm, while the left hand holds a vase. The uplifted bàck hands hold a rosary and a Ketaka flower. Her hair is braided on the top of her head and the loose curls cascading down to the shoulders. She has a plain halo on her back side. She wears a Yajnopavita and minimal amount of ornaments. Stylistically, the figures can be dated to 8th century. Another Parvati figure is found in the south raha niche, which stands in a graceful tribhanga pose holding a trident in her major right hand, placed against thigh. Her major hand holds a small vase. Her uplifted hands hold a rosary and ketaka flower. She is richly ornamented with a pearl necklace with a hanging pendant which is tied to a string of pearls looping around her waist, jewelled arm bands, bracelets and a jajnapavita . She wears a jeweled tiara and her hair is tied in a chignon on top of her head. She is flanked by a garland bearing Vidyadhara in each upper corner and by a female attendant in each lower corners. It seems stylistically, this image is of 8th century.16 Parvati as cult images can be used both in Shiva temple as well as Shakta temple. With the increasing importance of Parvati as the consort of Shiva, we find that she is worshipped in separate shrine, which is evident from the Parvati temple inside the Lingaraj temple compound. As cult images she is found in niches of different Shiva and Shakta temples like Svarnajaleshwara temple, Vaital temple Rajarani temple, temple, Lingaraj temple etc. Goddess parvati is the benevolent than of Goddess Shakti. Next to Parvati we find the depiction of Mahisamardini images in the temple of Vaital. One, of the most popular goddess of Shaktism is Mahisamardini Durga. Mahisamardini Durga is found depicted as cult deity on the temple wall as well as she is worshipped as presiding deity in a separate temple. But many of the later Mahisamardini images are housed in a separate shrines, generally on the north side of the compound or else placed in the Jagamohana . The references about Mahisamrdini Durga is found from ancient Indian literature17 like Virataparvan , Bhishmaparvan , Harivamsha , Markandeya Purana ,1H Mahishamardini Shtotra of the Tantrasara19 and the sanskrit poems of Mayura.20 In Vaital temple we find two images of Mahishmardini Durga , one in the north raha niche and the other is placed in the jagamohana. The former is a eight armed Mahishamardini in the north raha niche. She stands in the conventional Tribhanga pòse with her uplifted right foot placed on the shoulder of the demon and holds the standard attributes in her hands. The quiver of arrows appears behind her left</page><page sequence="6">Archaeology 1229 shoulder. The lion gnaws on the right arm of the demon. Some part of her facial features are damaged. In fact, it is an example of beautiful images of 8th century. Another image is found loosely placed in the jagamohana. The pose is same with the another four images. The only difference is that there the lion grows on the right leg of the demon. This is also a figure of 8th century AD. Sapta-Matrikas or the seven mothers, representing the Shaktis or the endowed energies of the important familiar deities, are Brahmani or ( Sarasvati ), Maheshvari (or Raudri) Kaumuri (or Kartikeyani), Vaishnavi (or Laxmi), Varahi Indrāni (or Mahendri) and Chamunda (or Chamundi). There are, however, occasional variations in the list of the Matrikas with regard to their number and the order of their enumeration. Usually they are seven, though eight or more of them can be counted.21 The iconographie features of these mothers are found in greater- details in the Agni Purana,22 the Amsumadbhedagama,2* the Purvakaranagama ,24 the Matsya Purana 25 the Rupavatrara ,26 the Shilparatna ,27 etc. Gopinatha Rao has described in details about the iconography of the Seven Mothers ( Brahmani , Vaishnavi , Indrāni, Chamunda, Maheshvari , Kaumari and Varahi in his work on Hindu Iconography. According to the Markandeya2H Purana , the Shaktis of the individual gods are determined by the respective forms, ornaments and mounts of those gods, as stated bý Rao, "these are the female counterparts who are armed with the same weapons, wear the same ornaments and ride the same Vahanas and carry the same banners as the corresponding male gods do." He says Brahmani should be sculptured like Brahma, Mahesvari like Maheswara, Vaishnavi like Vishnu, Varahi like a short woman with angry face and bearing a plough as her weapon, Indrāni like Indra and Chamunda as a terrific woman.29 The Saptamatrikas worshipped in Vaital temple are Brahmani Sivani, Kaumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrāni, Chamunda and one unidentified matrika . They are flanked by Virabhadra and Ganesha. The images of Saptamatrikas in the temple are following form right to left. Brahmi has three heads she is seated in Lalitasana on a Vishvapadama . She holds a Vija-puraka and a vase in her two major hands. Her uplifted right hand holds a rosary whereas the object in the left hand is obliterated.

She wears all conventional body ornaments and a plain halo is carved behind her had in the right corner of the pedestal is a figure seated in Ardhapuryanka with his left arm upraised and the right hand placed on his knee for support. The figure possibly represents Garuda though all of the conventional attributes are missing.30 Other objects depicted on the pedestal are a bowl of modakas, an incense- burner and a tall vase with loop handle. Varahi is seated in ardhapary anka. Her major right hand, resting on the uplifted knee, holding a fish where as the left hands a chord pot. The fish is a standard iconographie feature pn Orissan images of Varani .3I Her back hands hold a rosary and a Kuthara and she wears conventional body ornaments, including ornate earrings with pearl clusters. Her hair is arranged in a Karanda-mukuta. Her head is turned to the left to display her boor snout. A mandira charmi, a tall vase and a bowl heaped with fruit are carved on the pedestal.

An elephant on the right, a bowl of modaka at the centre and a</page><page sequence="8">Archaeology 1231 vase on the left are carved on the pedestal. Chamunda is the presiding deity of the temple. She is seated in Adhaparyanka at the centre of the west wall and is large than the other images. She has an emaciated body and has eight arms. Her major right hand holds a kartri while her left hand, with elbow supported by the raised left, knee, holds a Kapala by her chest. Another right hand is in Varada while others hold a damaru and indistinct object. One of the left arms cradles a Khatvriga and places the hard in carccika with the finger in her gaping mouth. The objects in the other left hands are indistinct She wears a long garland of skull and a skull medalim is in her coiffure. Her face, with gaping mouth and round eyes protruding from sunken sockets, is gruessome. It is difficult to determine if an elephant skin is above her head. A Vidyadhara is in each upper corner of the back-slab while an owl is perched in the lower left corner. Beneath Chamunda is a prostrate cropse with a (jackal nibbling on its toes).32 Lastly an unidentified eighth Matrika is found seated in lalitasana. She holds a trident and a lotus in her two hands and wears all conventional body ornaments. Her hair is braided in a broad chignon on top of her head. She has a plain halo behind her head. A vidyadhara is carved on the upper corners standing on a lotus. The pedestal is decorated with a kamandalu an incense burner, a tripod heaped with fruit and another kamandalu. The images has been variously identified as Shivaduti , Kaustki' or a benevolent aspecKof Chamunda. It seems Matrika worship was widespread throughout Orissa, with images as early as the 7th century. But it became popular during the Somvanisi period, dating from the 9th to 11th century.33 When many of the deities were provided special shrines, and the two Chausathi Yogini Pithas. The earliest suriving set of matrikas, however, is depicted on the north wall of the Nagnohana of the Parashurameshvara , temple. While on the Madhukeshvara temple and at Shimhanutha temple they decorated the door frame. In Shakta temples such as the Vaital temple or the destroyed Ch'andi temple at Bekhandi , the images are inserted into niches within the sanctum. Again individual Mutrukas like Chamunda , Varahi and Nrishimhi are provided with a temple of their own. In most latest exmples, as at Dharmasala , Japur , Khiching , Pedagadi , Puri , and Shathalllura , the original shrine has not survived and the images are now housed in later shrines. Additionally these deities also appear in niches as parshva-devatas or avarna-devatas.</page><page sequence="9">1232 IHC : Proceedings , 63rd Session, 2002 NOTES AND REFERENCES 1. J.N.
