Ion 999ff.), and whereas one of her children, Chrysaor, fathers a line of monsters, another, Pegasus, is linked with monster-slayers, which makes him a being 'in the service of order'. M.'s one hobby-horse is initiation. His enthu- siasm is well known: he edited a substantial two- volume collection on the topic, and the announce- ment that Mythes grecs II will be subtitled L'Initiation comes as no surprise. In the volume presently under review M. sees initiation as an origin of everything from the Flood (116: 'Or l'initiation individuelle, avec sa symbolique de la mort et de la resurrection, est l'une des cles pour comprendre le theme du deluge') to acts of decap- itation in the Iliad - for M., the poem echoes an epoch when warriors won their spurs by head- hunting. But the days are past (if they ever exist- ed) when initiatory explanations could be used without more ado as a hermeneutic panacea, and M. has not, I think, done enough to convince doubters. It would have helped his cause if he had been readier to admit that some cases of alleged initiatory schemata are more plausible than others. In the case of a few papers I was unclear about exactly what 'origins' we were looking for. Engaging chapters about mythical, world's-end locations blessed with lovely perfumes, about descriptions of distant peoples in Aeschylus, and about cannibalism (again usually located in dis- tant places), seem to be included on the ground that 'far away' can be an equivalent of 'long ago'; true enough, but the book's thematic unity does creak as a result. M. is at his most characteristic in a chapter (Part II, ch.3) about stories of involuntary homi- cide through discus-throwing (e.g. Apollo/ Hyacinthos). The approach is multi-layered. In the classical period, the story turns on the ineluctability of fate; go back a thousand years and you have a symbolic death during an initiatory test; back still further, and you are in Max Muller country (145): 'le discobole est le dieu du soleil symbolise par le disque et dont l'action est neces- saire au developpement de la vegetation [sc. with Hyacinthos' metamorphosis].' M.'s style is free from hectoring; the hypotheses are offered to the reader unflashily, genially; you don't feel that M. will be offended if you turn away unpersuaded. M. has the not-to-be-underestimated virtues of solidity, diligence, and modesty. Whether these are enough to sustain his readers over a marathon course of six volumes remains to be seen. RICHARD BUXTON University of Bristol CALAME (C.) Poetique des mythes dans la Grgce antique. Paris: Hachette, 2000. Pp.288. 2010211472. Urbino, Princeton, Lausanne, Paris, Diamantina (Brazil) - the venues at which Claude Calame has presented drafts of the chapters in this book res- onate like an up-market travel agent's come-hither. And his horizons are indeed truly international; in the preface he wickedly but fairly chastizes 'une coquetterie d'origine souvent parisienne qui tend a se renforcer' (9). He aims to transcend such limitations, while providing an approach to Greek story-telling which is both methodologically sophisticated and accessible to students. C. devotes a chapter each to the interpretation of seven narratives in specific literary contexts: Demeter and Persephone in HHDem.; Bellerophon in Iliad 6; the House of Atreus in Pythian 11; Io in PV and A. Suppliants; Helen in Herodotus and Gorgias; Teiresias in Callimachus' Bath of Pallas; and some Troezenian tales as recorded by Pausanias (all the key texts are help- fully included, in translation, in an Appendix). But C. would not be C. if he did not begin by pre- scribing for his readers a powerful enema of scep- ticism about the whole notion of myth(ology): '...les "mythes" grecs ne peuvent avoir d'exis- tence en dehors des mises en discours et des com- positions poetiques qui les portent a leur public' (13-14). That is: (a) the category 'myth' is a mod- ern construct; (b) no Greek story can be interpreted apart from its 'enunciative contexts'. The latter consideration leads C. into rich and detailed engagements with specific texts; the former con- sideration, however, obliges him to use so many inverted commas, and related expressions of avoidance, that readability often comes in a poor second behind purism. Within the space of thirty- five lines (36/7) we read: 'les recits speculatifs que nous appelons mythes', 'ces manifestations symboliques et discursives qu'on a denommees mythes depuis la fin du XVIIIe siecle...', and '[l]es recits en general poetiques que l'on apprehende depuis la fin du XVIIIe siecle par l'appellation et la notion de "mythe"'; and so on, passim. This stylistic tic is a pity; C. could have covered himself against a charge of the unspeak- able vice of 'essentialism' by means of a single statement of position at the outset. (Another piece of pedantry is the endless transliteration of Greek words, where in most cases a simple (although of course, by definition, imperfect) translation would have been the more pragmatic solution.) 178</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS After an exemplary discussion of how Persephone's abduction has been interpreted since antiquity, C. uses a nuanced account of notions of fictionality and performance as a basis for his own approach to this and other stories, an approach which emphasizes the contextual-performative aspects of myth narration. When applied to the Demeter/Persephone tale (perhaps sung at the Eleusinian Games (54)), this approach is contrasted by C. with interpretations in terms of the death and rebirth of vegetation. He goes on to make the more general point that the very act of regarding a multiplicity of narratives about x as constituting 'the myth of x' predisposes an interpreter to reduce the anthropomorphic figures acting in such stories to forces of nature or cosmological ele- ments (52-3). If C. is right, we may need to for- give him at least some of those variations on the theme of 'what we call "myths"'. About Bellerophon in Iliad 6 (ch.2), C. is sub- tle and intelligent. The distinction between 'the myth' and 'this narrative' is fruitfully developed, e.g. in relation to the absence of Pegasus: mention- ing the wonder horse might have risked evoking Bellerophon's hybristic flight to Olympus (86). On the theme of initiation, C. plausibly argues that it can get us part of the explanatory way (the break with the world of adolescence; the over- coming of monsters 'on the margins'; the eventu- al accession to royal power), but it cannot explain everything: after all, Bellerophon does not return to Greece to achieve reintegration and eventual dominion; his grandson Sarpedon will actually fight against the Greeks (82). Ch.3, on Pythian 11, enables C. to point out all the 'indices discursifs de l'enonciation' (personal pronouns, allusions to the performative context, etc.) in which the genre abounds (99). He also analyses the conundrum posed by the ode: how does Orestes' murderous vengeance relate to a young Theban's Pythian victory? Noting the refer- ences to blame as well as to praise, C. observes that this poem, like the genre it belongs to, reorients epic values to the ethical standpoint of the fifth- century citizen. In the conveying of this message, darkness as well as light has its role to play. To exemplify the 'mise en discours' of tragedy, C. chooses (ch.4) A. Suppliants and the genealogical narratives about Io in PV. This is a really superlative chapter; having read it out of duty as a reviewer, I went back and read it for pleasure. Particularly fascinating is the account of Io, Danaos, Belos and Agenor in terms of cen- tre and periphery (e.g. 120ff.); given the altera- tion between Greece and non-Greece which these interlocking stories involve, it is worth quoting C.'s completely persuasive observation on p.121: 'le pouvoir royal definitifne peut s'affirmer au cen- tre de la Grece que dans le passage par l'Egypte', i.e. the perceived cradle of civilization. Two more nuggets: (a) a full-blown initiatory explanation will not work for Io, since, although she becomes an adult through giving birth to Epaphos, she is not integrated into a household by marriage (127); (b) the Danaids' murder of their husbands is like a Flood, the regenerative Lynceus and Hypermestra being analogous to Deucalion and Pyrrha (132). The word 'poetique' in his title does not limit C. to poetry, since he is concerned with the fabri- cation of all kinds of stories. In ch.5 he looks at remodellings of Helen by Herodotus and Gorgias. I enjoyed this chapter less, partly because of the inelegant proliferation of narratological terms. The Bath ofPallas (ch.6) suits C. well since it raises questions about the hymn's performative aspect in relation to the Argive ritual which it evokes. C.'s careful account comes to the famil- iar conclusion that Alexandrine poetic mimesis has turned from the dramatic to the textual (195). The final analysis deals with part of Pausanias' account of Troezen (2.30-4). C. charts the complex narrative process whereby the Troezenians' land becomes political territory, and the no less complex spatial organization of the monuments, from centre to periphery, by which Troezenian religious topography is articulated. The discussion is mostly about the 'intra-discursif'; C. has nothing new to offer regarding the on- going debate about what audience Pausanias was writing for. When C. characterizes his approach as 'anime par une volonte sans doute un peu pedante de methode' (245), it is hard to disagree. Yet the learning and sheer acumen which he displays are worthy of the highest praise. RICHARD BUXTON University of Bristol HANKINSON (R.J.) Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought.
