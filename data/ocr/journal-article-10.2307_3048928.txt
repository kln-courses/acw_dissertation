<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Madonna and Child Miniature in the Book of Kells Part I* Martin Werner For Harry Bober I It is generally supposed that work was begun on the Book of' Kells at Iona during the second half of the eighth century and continued at Kells in the early years of the ninth, but this is by no means certain, and the birthplace and date of the manuscript remain problematic.1 More puzzling still are its full-page figural scenes which continue to frustrate attempts to discover their exemplars. Among these, the .M\adonna and Child miniature is perhaps the most enigmatic and certainly the most significant, for it is the earliest extant Madonna and Child illustration in a Latin codex (Fig. I). This rare and essential document for the student of Christian iconography has, nevertheless, received suprisingly little scholarly attention.2 The eccentric typological features of the picture have not been conclusively analysed. Its prog- ramatic relation to the other figural pages in the Book of Kells - that is to say, its role within the context of Gospel Book illustration - has not been considered. Yet it will become apparent that identification of the exemplar, or exemplars, followed for the miniature depends upon an exhaustive examination of typology and setting and the intimate relation between the two. This study will address itself to such an investigation. Our illustration, folio 7v, pictures the Madonna and Christchild on a richly decorated throne surrounded by four angels. Three of these angels carry staffs with circular terminals, the fourth holds a flowering staff. Enclosing the scene is an elaborate border composed of intertwined animal and anthropomorphic elements and pure interlace decoration upon which is placed, at the right, a rectangular compartment containing the profile busts of six tiny figures who face folio 8, an initial page announcing Matthew. The MIadonna page is unusual in presenting the Child and two angels without nimbi, but typologically its most striking aspect is the manner in which the principals are positioned. The Child sits across His mother's lap facing left. The Virgin is partly in profile; her legs are apparently crossed and emphatically represented as parallel to the picture plane, while her head and shoulders are given in frontal view. She sits on a high-backed throne presented in strict profile. An asymmetrical Madonna and Child type, the seated Hodegetria, occasionally appears in Early Christian art.3 The Kells group is a variant of this uncommon type, for instead of being shown as seated frontally on Mary's left or right knee as in orthodox seated Hodegetria figurations, Jesus now sits across His mother's angled lap, thereby creating a pattern of crossed diagonals. It is this last aspect of the Insular miniature - Kitzinger has termed it the complementary-profiles motif- which distinguishes it from almost all earlier or contemporary representations of the Madonna and Child. There exists another early medieval representation of the Madonna and Child employing the complementary-profiles arrangement, and it too is a product of an Insular center. Engraved on one of the short ends of the wooden coffin of St. Cuthbert, a monument fabricated at the Northumbrian monastery of Lindisfarne and generally given a late- seventh-century date,4 is the Virgin seated but without bench or throne and holding the Christchild, His feet pointing N.B. Part II of this article will appear in the June, 1972 issue of The Art Bulletin. Footnotes and illustrations have been numbered contin- uously through both parts. A bibliography of frequently cited sources, given short titles in the text, appears at the end of Part I. * This study is based on a paper read at the meeting of the College Art Association in Cleveland, Ohio, January, 1967. It was completed with the assistance of a grant from the Research Council, Rutgers University.

Roman catacomb painting features a Madonna and Child type which resembles it, but always within the context of the Adoration of the Magi scene. Lasareff, "Studies in the Iconography of the Virgin," Art Bulletin, xx, 1938, 46ff., has demonstrated it was in Egypt that the Hodegetria was separated from this scene at an early date, to develop its iconic character. This process began in Egypt because there the worship of the Virgin was widespread, en- couraged by the popularity of the pharaonic cult of Isis. The enthroned Hodegetria appears, outside the Adoration scene, in the chapel frescoes of Bawit and Saqqara, and in a number of 6th- and 7th-century reliefs; cf. Lasareff, "Iconography of the Virgin," n. i33; J. Beckwith, Coptic Sculpture, London, 1963, pls. 11I, 112; K. Wessel, Koptische Kunst, Recklinghausen, 1963, pls. 37, 78. The type was imported to Syrian and Armenian centers but never became popular in the metropolitan art of Constantinople; cf. Lasareff, "Iconography of the Virgin," 54, n. 76, 77; E. Kitzinger, "On Some Icons of the Seventh Century," Late Classical and Medieval Studies in Honor of A. M. Friend, Jr., Princeton, 1955, 132ff; G. A.

It is generally identified with the levis theca, the coffin which contained the body of St. Cuthbert at his burial in 680 A.D. This is the shrine Bede mentions in his Vita Cuthberti as fabri- cated at Lindisfarne to receive the "uncorrupt" body of the Anglo- Saxon abbot. The coffin and its contents are discussed in great detail in The Relics of Saint Cuthbert, ed. C. F. Battiscombe, Oxford, 1956. For Bede's description see B. Colgrave, Two Lives of St. Cuthbert, Cambridge, 1940, 294ff.</page><page sequence="2">2 THE ART BULLETIN ,::. ,:: - .:-?:, : ,:: .. : .. 1.: ::i -~i :i_-i :-ii? :::: I 8::;:ii - - ; :ix':::: -i: x*?- A d .. ::::::::: :: ?v p 1-:- :. -::-il.-_,:;-__ : :i: . : ? ?

Durham, Cathedral Library (drawing: Donald McIntyre, Cathedral architect) toward the left, across her lap (Fig. 2). Both figures are partially in three-quarter view, but their heads are shown en face. Despite differences of detail - both Mary and Jesus are nimbed and the latter is rigidly upright and hieratic - the Lindisfarne group, because of its use of the complement- ary-profiles formula, must be understood as intimately associated with the Virgin of Kells. Together the two represent a distinct and puzzling departure from the seated Hodegetria type.5 Apart from the profiles motif, which inserts an element of informality into what is otherwise an austere and hieratic representation, the coffin group is a more typical product of A~l t c 10- Ivi Itl 3 Fresco, Madonna and Child. Saqqara, Chapel 1725 (from Quibell, Excavations at Saqqara, Iv, pl. xxII) early medieval art than the Kells Madonna and Child. It resembles the orthodox seated Hodegetria in its emphasis on the rigidity of Christ's upright posture and in its use of such details as His holding a scroll in His left hand and blessing with His right. The Kells illustration, on the other hand, employs the profiles arrangement as but one aspect of a remarkably unconventional picture. The Child reaches out toward His mother with His left hand; their right hands touch as He leans back slightly against her left arm. Despite the Hiberno-Saxon stylization of the miniature, these elements of gesture and posture create a sense of intimacy and tenderness rarely encountered in the early medieval 5 For Early Christian compositions with some general similarities see Henry, Viking Invasions, 78, n. 8. Kitzinger, "Coffin-Reliquary," 248ff., was the first to understand the St. Cuthbert and Kells representations as "forming a group apart . . . with no obvious antecedents." As he points out, they share some similarities with later Byzantine and Spanish representations of the Adoration of the Magi. One such figuration, that in an IIth-century Spanish Beatus in Turin, Bib. Naz. Lat. Ms 93, fol. I 4V (W. Neuss, Die Apocalypse des heiligen Johannes, Mtinster, 1931, II, pl. xx [34]), does feature the complementary-profiles motif. Here too, although the feature is difficult to see, the Child's gesture may also be similar to that of His counterpart in the Book of Kells. In a number of respects the Turin composition resembles an illustration of the Virgin and Child in an I I th-century Toledan copy of the text of St. Ildephon- sus, De Verginitate Perpetua S. Mariae Adversus Tres Infideles (Florence, Bibl. Laur., Ashburnham I7). Perhaps an incomplete Adoration of the Magi scene, it pictures the enthroned Madonna in profile view. The Child, enveloped in a cloak, is seated on her left leg and turns toward her, an arrangement not far removed from that in the Turin Beatus. E. Rosenthal, "Some Observations on Coptic Influence in Western Early Medieval Manuscripts," Homage to a Bookman, Essays on MSS. Books and Printing Written for Hans P. Kraus, Berlin, 1967, 5iff., fig. I4, under- stands this and other of the miniatures in the book as "evidence of the migration of Coptic models into central Spain." B. Al Hamdani, "Burning Lamp and Other Romanesque Symbols for the Virgin that Came from the Orient," Commentari, 1965, I67ff., has cited the codex for its Oriental textual sources, and A. Grabar, "La fresque des saintes femmes au tombeau," Cahiers archdologiques, viII, 1956, 9ff., concluded that a number of its illustrations depend on very early Christian models. If, as Lasareff proposed, the seated Hodegetria was first separated from the Adoration of the Magi scene in Coptic Egypt, the Turin and Florence miniatures may possibly descend from models representing an early stage in this development, for, as we shall see, the seated Hodegetria variant with the complementary-profiles motif was probably created in Egypt and thus may have appeared there in a rare, archaic Epiphany setting. (Mozarabic illumination has been shown to draw upon Coptic and other Oriental sources of Early Christian date; cf. Rosenthal, "Coptic Influence," 65ff.; A. Thiery, "Note sull' origine della miniatura Mozarabica," Commentari, 1966, 241ff.)

Baltimore, Walters Art Gallery Latin sphere.6 While such informality is reminiscent of Greco-Roman secular imagery and of certain Epiphany scenes in the Roman catacombs, more immediate prece- dents are to be found in the Christian East. The expression of intimacy of relationship is the hallmark of the Galaktotrophousa (Lactans), a Madonna type which appears early in the evolution of the art of Coptic Egypt.7 The chapel frescoes at the monasteries of Bawit and Saqqara in Upper Egypt, generally dated to the sixth and seventh centuries,8 feature a fully developed version of the nursing Madonna. In Bawit Chapel 42, for example, the Christ- child, suckling at His mother's breast, leans back against her right arm and touches her left arm with His left hand.9 In Chapel 1725 at Saqqara, the Child, in three-quarter view, sits across the Madonna's lap and holds her left hand with both of His (Fig. 3 ).10 Mary's body is in frontal view but she turns her head to the left to look at her son. Al- together, the painting has a gentle, genre-like quality quite surprising when viewed in relation to the more character- istically severe and hieratic versions of the Mother and Child common throughout the Early Christain world. While, to be sure, the nursing theme itself creates an icono- graphic distinction between these Coptic portraits and the Virgin of Kells, similarities are more significant: the Insular Christchild's informal diagonal position, His semi-recum- bent posture, and His tender gestures bespeak an interest in maternal sentiment and childish dependence analogous to that encountered at Bawit and Saqqara. According to Andr6 Grabar, the several "Vierge de tendresse" types created in the Middle Ages - including the Galaktotrophousa - utlimately depend upon Egyptian inspira- tion. They are a reflection of an ancient and peculiarly Egyptian preoccupation with maternal feelings.11 In Christian times this attitude declares itself in the popularity of the apocryphal Gospels which, among other things, set out to satisfy widespread curiosity with accounts of the childhood ofJesus.12 In their Coptic and related Armenian versions, detailing at length the Virgin's maternal role and the Child's intense love for her, they represent expressions of humanized religious sentiment rare in Early Christian literature.13 Undoubtedly this peculiarly emotional milieu explains the widespread popularity of the Galaktotrophousa in Coptic Egypt. It also helps to account for the emergence of another tender Virgin type in Egypt, the Eleousa, long before it appears elsewhere in Christian art. This almost certainly evolved from the Hodegetria as a consequence of the heads of the Madonna and Child being brought together. An ivory relief in Baltimore depicts the enthroned Virgin and Child between two adoring angels (Fig. 4).14 Mary is shown in modified frontal view (turning slightly toward the right with her right knee extended). The Christchild is in profile. 6 The rigid and hieratic frontal Madonna and Child is the most fre- quently found type in the pre-Carolingian Latin West.

The Baltimore ivory, generally assigned a ninth-tenth-century date and Coptic provenance, is the earliest extant representation of the Eleousa; the type became popular only centuries later, par- ticularly in Byzantine centers. Thus, the Baltimore relief demonstrates a precocious Egyptian pictorial exploration of the more human and delicate aspects of the relationship between Madonna and Child.15 Significantly, this early Eleousa is of the same general age as the Kells portrait; with its motif of tender embrace it clearly resembles the some- what more restrained but equally unusual Insular group where again the Child appears in profile, leaning against the Madonna's left hand and extending His left arm upward toward her. If, as has been suggested, the Eleousa developed from the seated rather than the standing Hodegetria, the relation between the Baltimore and Kells groups points to a further possibility, namely, that the Kells Madonna and Child with its informality, asymmetry and tender gestures may reflect an early stage in this evolution. A study of the origins of and interrelations between the Galaktotrophousa and seated Hodegetria indicates that this transitional type may have been invented in Early Christian Egypt. The Galaktotrophousa appears to have descended from pharaonic representations of Isis nursing Horus, a subject which continued into the Coptic age.16 In some of these scenes the semi-recumbent Horus, placed across the lap of Isis, leans against his mother's arm and sometimes touches her hand. A second-century bronze drachma of the so-called Alexandrian type, now in Munich, offers an example (Fig. 5),17 and as late as the fourth century a fresco in a Roman house in Karanis depicts Horus affection- ately touching the hand of Isis, although here both deities appear in frontal view.18 A number of Egyptian reliefs of A 1t 5 Drachma, Isis and Horus.

Cairo, Coptic Museum (from Crum, Coptic Monuments, pl. xxv) 1, Until serious attention was given to the Baltimore ivory, it was generally assumed that the Eleousa was "conceived and developed on Byzantine soil .. ." (Lasareff, "Iconography of the Virgin," 36); the earliest Greek examples appeared in the IIth century, and the type became popular after the 12th (cf. Grabar, "Sur les origines et l'volution du type de iconographique la Vierge Eldousa," Melanges Charles Diehl, Paris, 1930, I, 29ff). Recent excavations at Faras, a site just above Wadi Halfa on the Nile, have revealed numerous Nubian frescoes dating from the 8th to the 12th century. One of these frescoes, of I ith-century date, shows the Eleousa between two (earlier) archangels. K. Michalowski, Faras, Zurich-Cologne, 1967, Io5ff., pls. 23-25, interprets the painting as closely associated with the Baltimore ivory and reflective of Coptic inspiration. Its date - early for an Eleousa - and the iconographic connections of other of the Faras frescoes with Coptic Egypt strengthens this possibility. Wessel, "Ikonographie der koptische Kunst," 232ff., has recently characterized the Eleousa (and the Galakto- trophousa) as dependent upon an Egyptian tradition of great antiquity, a thesis advanced some years ago by A. Grabar in his studies of the 13th-century Serbian Prizren Gospels. Cf. A. Grabar, "Recherches"; idem, "Deux images," 264ff., figs. 179, 182. 16 See H. W.

Moreover, some of these pagan compositions are as informal as the Isis and Horus images described above. A fifth-century relief from Achmin, for example, shows Horus leaning against Isis's right arm and reaching upward toward her.19 It would appear that not only does the Galaktotrophousa, and probably also the seated Hodegetria, develop from pharaonic Isis and Horus compositions, but that specific details associated with such tender Virgin types as those in the Baltimore ivory and Book of Kells - the semi-recumbent positioning of Jesus, His reaching upward and the gentle touching of hands - find their ultimate inspiration in such pagan representations. If, as seems likely, the Eleousa evolved in Egypt from the seated Hodegetria, the introduction of informal details derived from pharaonic imagery was clearly a fundamental part of the process. For the purpose of methodological clarity a distinction must be made between the tender gestures of the Madonna and Child (and the Child's semi-recumbent posture) and the position of the legs in the Kells illustration. In regard to the first, it is clear that significant similarities exist between the Kells composition and Coptic and earlier Egyptian figurations. An analysis of the complementary-profiles motif leads to conclusions somewhat less definite but perhaps ultimately more rewarding. While none of the Coptic Virgin and Child groups thus far discussed makes un- equivocal use of the profiles motif, their very lack of rigid frontality suggests a tendency in that direction, and there are other indications that it was known in Coptic times. Isis and Horus images sometimes feature the arrangement. The second-century Munich drachma, cited earlier for the informal qualities of its Isis nursing Horus composition, clearly employs the device. Another more provincial version of the subject, engraved on a stele in the Coptic Museum, Cairo, and perhaps of seventh-century date, turns the upper torso of Isis toward the viewer but shows her legs and throne in profile and presents Horus in profile, seated across his mother's lap (Fig. 6).20 Given the connections between Galaktotrophousa and Isis nursing Horus images, and the by no means uncommon use of the complementary- profiles device in the latter, it seems probable that Coptic artists were encouraged to incorporate the motif, along with other pharaonic details, into early Galaktotrophousa repre- sentations. Evidence in support of this judgment is found in the Pantocrator Grotto at Latmos in Asia Minor. Its frescoes, usually assigned a seventh-eighth-century date and associ- ated with Egyptian monks from Sinai and South Arabia, include, in the lower zone, an especially interesting Galakto- trophousa.21 It is poorly preserved, but the drawing made by A. von Gerkan some years ago seems to show the comple- mentary-profiles arrangement. Contemporaneous seated Hodegetria compositions may also reflect knowledge of the motif. A Coptic sixth-seventh-century silk in London shows the enthroned Virgin supporting the Child across her left knee and possibly across her lap (Fig. 7).22 Again, as in the Latmos fresco, the design lacks clarity, and a careful analysis has failed to reveal whether or not Mary's legs are in three- quarter view. The possibility is, however, very real, for the Madonna's head is turned toward the right and her right arm and shoulder are in oblique view. Further evidence for early Coptic employment of the device is its appearance in a more recent southeast Mediter- ranean composition. In 1961 a series of frescoes was uncovered in a basilica at Faras, Nubia. These wall paint- ings range in date from the eighth to the twelfth century and include an enthroned Madonna and Child created in the eleventh century (Fig. 8).23 Although a section of this fresco - the area between the Child's waist and the Madonna's neck - has been damaged, revealing a segment of an earlier painting, enough remains of the picture to indicate the attitude of the two figures. The Virgin is in three-quarter view with Jesus sitting across her lap, His legs in profile. Because of the damage suffered by the fresco, it cannot be determined whether it was meant to represent a Galakto- trophousa or seated Hodegetria. In either case, the comple- mentary-profiles formula is utilized for a Mother and Child representation in a Nubian setting closely linked to the art of Christian Egypt.24 The Faras Madonna was created several hundred years after the London silk and the Latmos fresco, yet Nubia's ties with Egypt and the absence of contemporary Byzantine parallels for the painting suggest its dependence on a Coptic exemplar, of which the Victoria 19 Berlin, Staatsmuseum, Inv.

Restle, Byzan- tine Wall Painting in Asia Minor, Greenwich, Connecticut, 1967, I, 78ff., has proposed a tentative date of ca. 850.

She supports with her left hand the back of the semi-recumbent Child who sits across her lap and reaches upward with His left hand. Several features indicate a remote ancestry for the model that inspired this Hodegetria variant. The intimate relation- ship of Mother and Child is analogous to that discernible in a number of early Coptic Galaktotrophousa compositions, and, of course, the existence of the Baltimore Eleousa ivory - a work understood as an offshoot of the enthroned Hodegetria - is suggestive of the early appearance of a Madonna type resembling the Gunda Gundie Virgin and Child. The fifteenth-century painting is one of a series of Ethiopic miniatures which share few similarities with the Byzantine Hodegetria or Eleousa.28 Conceivably, these pictures may represent a local variation or misreading of an earlier or contemporary Madonna type. Given the developments in Egypt discussed above, it seems more likely that they depend upon a rare, transitional Virgin type - a kind of proto-Eleousa - which was in existence by 800 A.D.29 The possibility thus presents itself that informal aspects of the Kells Madonna picture - the half-reclining position of the Child and His gestures - may be linked to Coptic pictorial manifestations of a traditional Egyptian interest in maternal sentiment. Moreover, it also seems likely that the eccentric complementary-profiles juxtaposition employed in the Insular miniature may have been invented by Coptic artists. Both the Galaktotrophousa and seated Hodegetria owe a profound debt to pharaonic invention. The London silk and the Latmos Virgin and Child offer tentative indication that this debt included the adoption of the profiles motif. The eleventh-century Faras fresco further underlines the possi- bility, and the existence of the Gunda Gundie page increases the likelihood that a variant of the seated Hodegetria employ- ing the device was known in Early Christian Coptic Egypt. An acknowledgement of this possibility serves to strengthen the view that the Kells portrait represents an early stage in the evolution from seated Hodegetria to Eleousa - the stage when the Child, turning toward His mother, touches her breast and her hand. This is not to say that all proto- Eleousa representations employed the profiles arrangement but rather that a significant number must have done so, for the type seems to have been preserved in remote and provincial monastic centers. Four small angels frame the monumental central group in the Hiberno-Saxon picture, introducing by their size and symmetrical placement a dogmatic and sacerdotal note striking in its juxtaposition to the affectionate relationship between Mother and Child (Fig. i). A similarly unusual antithesis appears in ninth-century Coptic Galaktotrophousa miniatures. The frontispiece in a hagiographic manuscript in the Morgan Library (Ms 612), for example, features an adoring angel above each side of the Madonna's throne (Fig. 10).30 They impart a hieratic and iconic sense to a composition otherwise emphasizing informality of gesture and pose. As in the Kells illustration these angels are about half the size of the Virgin, and such diminutive angels are seen again on the Baltimore Eleousa ivory and on a second carving, probably a companion piece, a Hodegetria, now in the Castello Sforzesco collection, Milan (Fig. I i).31 In these Coptic monuments the angels' wings are made to form a kind of canopy above the Madonna's head, an arrangement found earlier on a number of Madonna and Child reliefs from Egypt (and Armenia).32 This "canopy-wings" motif is almost ubiquitous in late medieval Ethiopic paintings of the 25 In this connection it should be mentioned that Michalowski, ibid., io6ff., 124, 137, 152ff. and passim, has noted the close similarities be- tween a number of scenes at Faras - including several featuring the Madonna and Child - and earlier Coptic representations. He singles out our I Ith-century Mother and Child as especially interesting, comparing it with the seated Hodegetria in Chapel 6 at Bawit. The latter is frontal and hieratic but resembles the Faras group in its general arrangement and in its use of a jeweled throne. More significant, perhaps, is the identical way the Child crosses His legs in both paintings. The detail appears again on the Baltimore Eleousa ivory. 26 B.

Leroy, "Notes," 230ff., pls. 89 (I), 86 (2); Mordini, "Convento," 49, fig. 23. 29 Each of the Ethiopic pictures would represent a true Eleousa if the Child's head were brought a little closer to the Madonna's. The result would not create an Eleousa of the Byzantine type, for in these Ethiopic paintings Jesus sits on His mother's lap, while in 12th-century and later Byzantine works the Child stands on His mother's knees and reaches upward toward her cheek; see note 15. 30 Morgan Ms 612 is dated 893 A.D.; M.

Milan, Castello Sforzesco Virgin between angels.33 Although the Madonna's size and position do not allow them to touch, the wings of the two lower angels in Kells folio 7v arch upward in similar fashion. Such correspondences are especially interesting in view of the fact that with the exception of the Book of Kells, early full-page miniatures of the enthroned Virgin and Child with adoring angels are only to be found in Coptic manuscripts. In one important particular the Insular page differs from the Eastern representations thus far discussed. It offers four rather than two attendant angels, who, introduced as pairs in the upper and lower zones, enhance the self-contained and iconic character of the work. Compositionally, the angels resemble the attendants in several early Coptic representations.34 The contemporaneous Milan ivory, for example, presents the Hodegetria between four smaller figures in an Epiphany setting.

The thirteenth-century Spanish Charter of Santo Domingo contains a full-page illustration .of the nursing Madonna which includes four symmetrically placed angels (and busts of the Evangelist symbols at the *corners of the frame). It is remarkably archaic and Oriental in appearance (Fig. I2).36 The Virgin has the facial mark- ings which sometimes appear in Coptic paintings; the Child's gesture is reminiscent of that of Jesus in Chapel 42 at Bawit.

Dublin, Trinity College MS 58, A.I.6, fol. Ir the face and crown of the Madonna closely resemble the angels in Morgan ms 612 (Fig. o). As in the Coptic painting their bodies are in profile view, their heads enface, and their hands are extended toward the central group. Moreover, the peculiar arrangement of their wings - the wings nearest the Virgin form a kind of arc framing her head, those nearest the border turn sharply downward - is the same as that seen in a number of Coptic, Armenian and Ethio- pian works. The two angels who flank Mary in the lower half of the Spanish miniature, although not full-length, adopt the same pose as their companions above and are placed just over the sides of the throne, as in a number of Coptic representations. Since, as we have noted, images of the Madonna and Child surrounded by four attendants dis- posed in two zones are not unknown in Coptic Egypt, it is probable that the Santo Domingo page, especially in view of its archaistic appearance, depends on Coptic sources.37 36 Statutes, Santo Domingo de Tarrega, Barcelona, Archivo de la Corona d'Arag6n. Cf. J. Dominguez Bordona, Manuscritos con Pituras, Madrid, 1931, 1, 36. A Gospel Book assigned to I Ith-century Monte Cassino (Vat. Libr. Lat. Ms 3741) also contains a miniature of an enthroned, frontal Madonna and Child surrounded by four smaller angels. Stylistically the illustration seems to depend upon provincial Byzantine sources, but its arrangement of angels turning toward Mary with outstretched hands recalls the angel pairs in Morgan Ms 612, the Milan ivory, etc. Cf. A. Mufioz, L'art byzantin, Rome, 1906, 89; B. Degenhart, "Autonome Zeichnungen bei mittelalterlichen Kiinstlern," Miinchner Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, 1950, II6. -7 A 15th-century Ethiopic icon now in the Coptic Museum, Cairo (Inv. No. 3767), is noteworthy in this connection. It shows four angels framing a standing Hodegetria. Two appear above and support an object, probably a crown, above her head; the two below are upright and frontal. J. Leroy, "Notes," 229ff., pl. 81 (1), has noted similarities between the work and the Gunda Gundie and other Ethiopic Madonna miniatures cited above. We may add that one important feature of the icon and the miniatures is the startlingly large size and apparent maturity of the Christchild. The mature Child type appears in Coptic art (in the Baltimore Eleousa ivory, the Victoria and Albert silk, etc.) and may reflect parochial inspiration; Lasareff, "Iconography of the Virgin," 28, mentions a "curious Egyptian custom of nursing an infant until the birth of the following child." Significantly, Jesus in the Kells miniature also seems uncommonly mature, and the Child on St. Cuthbert's coffin is as large as His counterpart in the Ethiopian compositions.</page><page sequence="11">BOOK OF KELLS I II Fortunately, the angels are identified in the Santo Domingo miniature; inscriptions above their heads name the four as the archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel. The first two are, of course, frequently encountered in Christian art; Raphael appears less commonly, especially in the West, and Occidental depictions of Uriel are quite rare after the eighth century and the banning of his cult.38 As a group, the four archangels are found infrequently in the East before the time of the Iconoclastic Controversy, par- ticularly in conjunction with the Madonna and Child. There is, however, a Coptic example of just such a juxta- position. Busts of the archangels appear on the arms of a small sixth- or seventh-century pectoral cross in Berlin. They frame a central, hieratic Madonna and Child (Fig. 13).39 The Apocrypha provide evidence of a special reverence for this archangel group in Egypt. They are mentioned in the Book of Enoch and in the Book of Esdras, works considered as canonical by the Copts and Ethiopians;40 and they are given special eucharistic significance in the Ethiopian Mass.41 This evidence of the identification of the four archangels in the Spanish illustration with an archangel group having exceptional importance for the Copts and appearing in early Coptic Virgin and Child representations would seem to insure their descent from a Coptic prototype. Since they are compositionally and iconographically similar to the Spanish quartet we may suppose the Kells angels to have a similar origin. The attributes held by the Kells angels have symbolic associations which support this conclusion.42 Three of the angels - the two above and the angel at the lower left - appear to carry flabella, the fans originally used to keep flies away from the bread and wine in Eastern Christian churches. By the fourth century these fans figure in the liturgy of the Byzantine, Coptic and Armenian churches.43 They are represented on several folios in the Book of Kells,44 including the Temptation of Christ miniature where, in a niche at the base of the temple, a half-length figure holds two flabella crossed over his chest.45 Combinations of attributes - the flabellum, the foliate staff, the cross etc. - crossed upon the chest appear in eighth-century Hiberno-Saxon illumination,46 and earlier in Coptic art.47 This "X" motif is ultimately pharaonic, originating in representations of Osiris, the Lord of the Under- world and Judge of the Dead holding scepter and whip, symbols of divinity and kingship, crossed over his chest.48 The arrangement acquires beatific and eschatological 38 The cult of Uriel was prohibited by the councils of Rome (745 A.D.) and Soissons (749 A.D.). Thereafter Uriel is infrequently mentioned in Latin literature or identified in Latin art. Cf. "Anges," Cabrol-Leclerq, 12, cols. 2087ff. 39 O.

Perdrizet, "L'archange Ouriel," Steminarium Kondakovianum, II, 1928, 241ff.; Kitzinger, "Coffin-Reliquary" 276f. 41 In the above-mentioned apocryphal text Uriel is named as the angel of Revelation, and he and the quartet in which he appears are especially revered in Ethiopia. An invocation is pronounced at the close of the Mass, placing the faithful under the protection of the four creatures of St. John's apocalyptic vision and the four archangels of Enoch. Uriel was commemorated on July 15 by the Ethiopians and, despite censure, this was also true in Spain until the late I5th century when the liturgy was reformed, an interesting coincidence in the light of the employment of the archangel set in the Spanish Santo Domingo miniature. See Perdrizet, "L'archange Ouriel," 245; "Anges," Cabrol-Leclerq, 12, cols. 2087ff. 42 The angels in the Gunda Gundie Virgin and Child illustration hold double-edged swords. They point to them, an arrangement similar to that in our Kells miniature, where the angels point to their staffs. Sword-bearing angels (most often Michael and Gabriel) are frequently seen in Ethiopic art. Here again connections with Coptic Egypt are apparent; the archangels Michael and Gabriel, each holding a sword, are shown flanking the enthroned Mother and Child on medieval Coptic textiles. See W.

Although representations of flabella are found in Latin reliefs before the 9th century, they do not appear in complex figural contexts. Conversely, the Coptic church of Abd el Qadir contains an 8th-century fresco showing a deacon holding a flabellum (Deutsches Institutfiir Aegyptische Altertumskunde Mitteilungen, vII, 1937, pl. 32), and later Byzantine and Oriental liturgical scenes often include flabellum- carrying archangels (J.

The scepter becomes the palm, the symbol of Christ's Resurrection in the Domnica in Palmis.49 All this is important not only because it seems to indicate a Coptic source for the flabella carried by three of the angels on folio 7v, but also because it suggests an interpretation for the foliate staff (ending in two projections which symmetri- cally curve back toward the handle somewhat in the manner of a fleur-de-lis) held by the fourth angel. This attribute may have been meant to represent a palm, a conclusion justified not only for the reason that palm and flabellum appear in similar settings in Insular art,50 but also because a palm-carrying angel is used in a contemporaneous and related Coptic composition: the angel to the Virgin's left on the Milan ivory (Fig. I I) holds a palm leaf in his hand.51 Quite possibly the prototype of the Kells angel quartet showed the group with the attributes which appear in the Insular miniature. Such staffs seem to have acquired symbolic meanings in Egypt which would serve to amplify the liturgical and eschatological ideas associated with the four spiritual beings themselves. Moreover, the palm, being a sacramental object blessed before the principal Mass on Palm Sunday and referring to the triumph and Resurrec- tion of Christ, symbolically complements the flabellum. Both attributes allude to the eucharist and Christ's pledge of redemption. It becomes obvious from the foregoing that important typological and iconographic aspects of the Kells Virgin folio find parallels in the southeast Mediterranean: its comple- mentary-profiles motif and other informal details are seen 49 C.

It is similar to the attribute carried by the fourth angel in the Kells illustration. However, Kitzinger, "Coffin-Reliquary," 275, n. 4, interprets the fleur-de-lis terminal type which appears on St. Cuthbert's coffin and in modified form in Kells, as dependent upon "a classical form of the imperial sceptre." 51 It may be noteworthy that the "staff" carried by the angel to the Madonna's left in the Baltimore ivory widens toward the top. Possibly it too may represent a palm. A palm does figure in another Coptic image of Madonna and Child. R. Forrer, Die friihchristlichen Alterthiimer aus dem Graiberfelde von Achmim-Panopolis, Strasbourg, 1893, pl. 1 7 (1), illustrates a 7th-8th-century textile which includes a palm to the right of the principals.</page><page sequence="13">BOOK OF KELLS I 13 r rG-~r ' Ig St. Cuthbert's coffin, on short side, Archangels. Durham, Cathedral Library (drawing: Donald McIntyre) in Coptic or related East Christian representations of Virgin and Child; its iconic arrangement with diminutive angels framing Mother and Child echoes contemporaneous Coptic compositions. Thematically, the angels may depend upon a rare archangel set having apocryphal and liturgical importance in Egypt, and employed in Coptic art by the sixth or seventh century. The attributes which the angels carry also suggest Coptic invention. Given these correspond- ences, it seems reasonable to suppose that the Virgin and Child group and the angel quartet on folio 7v were intro- duced from a single exemplar in which they were juxtaposed for a particular dogmatic purpose. As we shall see, this conclusion has special relevance to the question of the iconographic relation of the miniature to other illustrations in the Book of Kells. II Folio 7v follows a set of architectural Canon Tables and other prefatory material at the opening of the book. It faces an elaborately decorated initial page which begins with a large N and six lines of capitals - the NJativitas XPI of the Breves Causae, and serves to illustrate that text. The practice of employing full-page illustrations within each of the Gospels is peculiar to the Book of Kells. Contemporary counterparts are lacking in the early medieval West,52 but antecedents are not. The juxtaposition of full-page miniatures and initial pages in the body of the manuscript is the product of Insular invention and grows out of the long established custom of emphasizing specific texts by giving them large initials. In Kells, narrative scenes elaborate text passages. On folio i 14 the Arrest of Christ is accompanied by the lines Et ymno dicto exierunt in montem oliveti (Matthew 26: 30). Folio i i4v con- tains the next verse repeated twice, Tunc dicit illis ihs. omnes vos scan. (The Arrest itself is described in a later paragraph but the illustration is appropriate at the beginning of the Passion text.) The Temptation of Christ on folio 202v faces a decorated page with large initials for Luke 4:I: Ihs. autem plenus sps. sco.53 Clearly, the Virgin miniature is employed, as are these two illustrations, to emphasize a particular text, in its case the reference in the summaries of St. Matthew to the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. Like the Arrest and Tempta- tion illustrations, it does not stand apart from the text, nor does it mark the opening or close of each Gospel or the complete codex as miniatures do in earlier Insular produc- tions.54 Nevertheless, the relation of folio 7v to its textual setting differs in a fundamental manner from that of the afore- mentioned Kells illustrations to theirs. Both the Arrest and Temptation have a descriptive sense and easily relate to the Gospel passages accompanying them. The Virgin and Child picture less explicitly illustrates the Breves Causae passage. It is a Madonna and Child adored by four angels, a Madonna in Majesty, an iconic and essentially symbolic representa- tion and not the Nativity scene that the Breves Causae passage seems to call for. Because of its symbolic and doctrinal characteristics, it could not have been part of the historical cycle of the Life of Christ which may have provided models for the Arrest and Temptation illustrations. 52 Early Insular Gospels employ a four-symbols page as a preface to the four Gospels or to each Gospel; cf. Werner, "Four Symbols Page," 5ff. Sometimes an Evangelist page or an Evangelist and symbol page begins each Gospel; a richly decorated folio facing an initial page is added to create an introductory sequence. In the 8th-century St. Gall Gospels, full-page Crucifixion and Last Judgment scenes close the volume (pp. 226, 267) and stand apart from the text. The contemporaneous fragmentary Bobbio Gospels also contains two miniatures, the first resembling an Ascension, the second showing Christ accompanied by ninety-six saints. These pages probably originally prefaced or followed the Gospel text. For St. Gall, Stiftsbibliothek Ms 5 I1, see J. Duft, P. Meyer, The Irish Miniatures in the Cathedral Library of St. Gall, Olten-Lausanne, 1954; Lowe, C.L.A., VII, 1956, No. 901 ; McGurk, Gospel Books, No. I1 7; Henry, Irish Art (to 8oo A.D.), I96ff. For Irish Gospels, Turin, Bib. Universitaria Naz. Ms O, IV, 20, see McGurk, Gospel Books, 29. The Book of Kells is unique, for besides four symbols pages, Evangelist portrait pages and decorative pages, it employs illustrations within each Gospel. These either enlarge a text to resemble an initial page or illus- trate it. See McGurk, Gospel Books, I iff.; Henry, Viking Invasions, 72, n. I. 53 McGurk, "Two Notes on the Book of Kells and its relation to other Insular Gospel Books," Scriptorium, IX, 1955, I05ff., points out that while internal pictures (illustrations inserted within the Gospel texts) do not appear in extant early Latin Gospel Books, such codices employ the practice of starring important passages. This practice is elaborated in 8th-century Insular manuscripts. Finally, in the Book of Kells, the Madonna and Child, Arrest and Temptation scenes are used to accen- tuate certain text passages. 54 Interesting in this regard is folio I24r, a framed page with large capitals for Matthew 27:38: Tunc crucifixebant Xpi. cum eo duos latrones. Three inserts, each containing five profile busts appear in the frame. These busts all face folio 123v which is blank and presumably intended for an illustration of the Crucifixion. It is likely that the six busts inserted into the frame on folio 7v perform a function analogous to those on folio 123v, for they face folio 8, the initial page on which the Nativity is prominently mentioned. In other words, the tiny busts appearing on the Madonna and Child and Tunc crucifixebant pages were probably intended as a device which would bring text and illustration into more intimate relation.</page><page sequence="14">14 THE ART BULLETIN An examination of the relation of the miniature to other illustrated pages in the Book reinforces this view. In fact, such an analysis suggests that the model for folio 7v was not only symbolic in character but a constituent of a dogmatic- ally complex non-historical program or cycle. The decor- ated pages in the Book may be arranged in several distinct groups. Apart from ornamented initial pages and a single '"cross-carpet page," there are architectural Canon Tables (with Evangelist symbols and other figural elements inserted under and around the arcades), folios presenting the four Evangelist symbols, portraits of the enthroned Evangelists and Gospel scenes. Of the latter the Arrest and Temptation pictures survive, and the original program may also have called for Crucifixion, Ascension and Last Judgment scenes.55 There are, finally, three illustrations - the Madonna and Child, a picture once thought to be of an Evangelist but now, most often, understood as a representation of Christ, and the third, an Evangelist symbol quartet given part of a text page - which iconographically stand apart from the other figural pages in the codex. Some years ago A. M. Friend proposed the existence of a special relationship between folios 32v and Ir, the last two cited above. He identified folio 32v as an image of Christ in Majesty (Fig. 14)56 and concluded that its model contained the four zoanthropomorphic57 Evangelist symbols which appear on folio Ir (Fig. 15). The symbols, placed in a panel probably originally intended for text, are shown in the act of presenting their Gospels, as if to the Savior. Yet Jesus does not appear on this or the facing page. Out of context on folio i, the symbols become intelligible when considered in relation to the image of Christ on folio 32v. In other words, they are a displaced component of the Christ in Glory repre- sentation.58 If Friend's thesis is accepted - and there is much to recommend it - the Book of Kells becomes not only the earliest Latin Gospel Book to contain internal illustrations (the Arrest, Temptation and Madonna and Child) but also the first to include both a full-page (albeit incomplete) Majestas Domini and a Madonna and Child miniature. Insular decorative practice explains the position of the Virgin and Child picture within the Gospel text. Similarly, the assignment of Christ to folio 32v reflects recent fashion, for it conforms to a contemporary Latin practice of employ- ing a Christ Mlajesty as the frontispiece to St. Matthew's Gospel rather than as an introductory miniature to the complete Gospel Book.59 To this may be added the fact that the separation of the Evangelist symbols from the Enthroned Christ and their installation on folio Iv must surely be due to the Kells artists' disregard for the original disposition of the subjects in the exemplar. Therefore, it is obvious that the present arrangement of the symbolic pages in our codex depends on factors which have little or no relevance to a determination of their sources or interrelation. As noted earlier, the closest relative to the central group on folio 7v is the engraved Madonna and Child on one of the short sides of the coffin of St. Cuthbert, the late seventh- century product of the Lindisfarne atelier. This family resemblance takes on increased significance in the light of the complex iconographic program within which the St. Cuthbert Virgin is employed. Christ and the four symbols of the Evangelists appear on the lid of the coffin (Fig. 16). Below, rows of apostles (Fig. 17) and archangels (Fig. 18) respectively line each of the long sides. Two archangels are engraved on the short side nearest Christ's head (Fig. 19); the Madonna and Child group (Fig. 2) completes the arrangement at the opposite end. These engravings have been interpreted as a juxtaposition of independent and 55 The Book of Kells was cut down by a binder - perhaps in the I9th century - who destroyed the edges of the illustrations. There are also a few leaves missing, including folios at both ends. Some of these may have disappeared at the time the codex was stolen in 1oo7, others after 1621, when it was recorded that the book had 344 leaves. Only 339 leaves remain today. The last four chapters of St. John are missing from the end of the book and may have included a Last Judgment illustration inten- ded for the chapters on the Passion. (Crucifixion and Last Judgment miniatures follow the Gospel of St. John in the St. Gall Gospels.) Two of the Evangelist portraits have also disappeared, and there may also have been a figural page in St. Mark opposite an enlarged Erat autem. Of the evangelical scenes intended but not completed, we have mentioned the Crucifixion (cited in note 54 above). An Ascension may also have been contemplated for the blank folio at the end of St. Luke. See Henry, Viking Invasions, 69ff. 56 Friend, "Canon Tables," 630ff. 57 These creatures have been variously called anthropomorphic symbols, Evangelists with heads of animals on human bodies and anthropo- zomorphic Evangelists. Although I would agree with R. Crozet, "Les representations anthropo-zoomorphiques des evangdlistes dans l'en- luminure et dans la peinture murale aux epoques carolingienne et romane," Cahiers de civilisation midiivale, I, 1958, 182, that these beings possess both human and animal qualities, it seems likely that their animal characteristics make them, in a sense, personifications of the Evangelists. Their early employment in place of orthodox symbols in pre-Carolingian Majesty compositions also suggests that they should be understood as symbolizing rather than representing the Gospel authors. 58 Read across from left to right the heads of these creatures are those of calf, lion, eagle and man. Three of the symbols carry books and face and move toward the right; the Matthew symbol employs the "Osiris- pose" discussed earlier but otherwise resembles the other creatures. Almost certainly, the zoanthropomorphic symbols were taken from a model showing them presenting their Gospels to the Savior - the model which inspired the picture of Christ on folio 32v. The separation of the Majestas components is difficult to account for but may have resulted from the interruption caused by the Viking attack on Iona. The internal confusion arising from the employment of numerous artists over a long period may also have been a contributing factor. Henry, Viking Invasions, 70, cites a passage in the Annals of Ulster which is interesting in this connection. It mentions the death of Connachtach, "eminent scribe and abbot of Ia (Iona)." Henry speculates that Connachtach may have established the decorative plan of the codex. If so, his death may help explain the numerous incomplete and blank pages in the book. Be that as it may, the decoration of the Gospel of St. Matthew is strikingly incomplete in just that section in which the portrait of Christ appears. The Genealogy pages (folios 26-39v) were meant to be framed (ruling appears on these leaves but was not filled in), and folios 32 and 33v - those before and after the picture of Christ - are blank. (It seems quite possible that the symbols now pictured on folio Iv were intended for one of these blank pages, most likely folio 32.) See note I 17 below. 59 The Gospels of Sainte Croix of Poitiers, a manuscript from the Amiens region, probably completed during the second half of the 8th century, and the early 9th-century Lorsch Gospels, a product of the Court School of Charlemagne, employ Majesty pages as frontispieces to St. Matthew's Gospel.

Despite additions and alterations, the program clearly centers on the mystical and doctrinal relation between the Virgin and Child of Incarnation and the Christ of the Second Coming and the Last Judgment. Support for this hypothesis appears in Bede's Vita Abbatum Wiremuthensium et Girvensium. Bede describes the pictures of the Madonna and apostles and Christ and saints that Benedict Biscop employed to adorn the church of Saint Peter at Wearmouth (ca. 690) as evoking thoughts of the Incarnation and the Last Judgment.62 Considering the dogmatic images available to the seventh-century Insular artist, it seems likely that Mary and the apostles were shown in relation to an image of Christ surrounded by the apoca- lyptic beasts, the symbols of the Evangelists - as on St. Cuthbert's coffin.63 Moreover, Bede's reference to "our Lord's Incarnation"64 and a survey of surviving sixth- seventh-century icons suggest that the Virgin appeared enthroned holding the Christchild.65 At the very least, Bede's report indicates the juxtaposition of images inter- preted as representing Incarnation and Judgment (within the didactic framework of Redemption) at Wearmouth at a date contemporaneous with the fabrication of St. Cuth- bert's coffin a few miles away at Lindisfarne. Confirmation of the importance attached to the inter- relation of these themes in early medieval Britain is found in the early Anglo-Saxon tripartite poem Christ associated with 01,, L; ir Anti TTo ;Niiii Aft # , , !?,;P woo. 20 Fresco with Christ Enthroned above the Madonna and Child and apostles.

Although only one of the three is definitely assigned to Cynewulf himself, the units are sequentially arranged and thematically associated (the Ascension historically and symbolically unites the other two mysteries as Christ's human nature is taken into heaven).66 This doctrinal arrangement of the segments of Christ and the similar 60 Kitzinger, "Coffin-Reliquary," 277. 61 On the models consulted for various figures and groups see M. Werner, "Majestas Domini," 22ff.; Kitzinger, "Coffin-Reliquary," 218ff. 62 The Virgin and twelve apostles were intended for the nave - probably for a transverse wall - other sacred figures for the south wall, and images evoked by the Revelation of St. John for the north wall.

See E. Kitzinger, "Byzantine Art of the Period between Justinian and Iconoclasm," Berichte zum XI Internationalen Byzantinisten-Kongress, Munich, 1958, 42; also Henry, Irish Art (to 8oo A.D.), 90, for Cogitosus' description of an Irish iconostasis paralleling that given by Bede. Bede's pictures were probably wooden icons and it is quite possible that that of the Virgin included the Christchild; extant icons of early date represent- ing the Virgin show her holding the Child. See, for example, the Madonnas of Santa Maria Nuovo and Santa Maria in Trastevere and the Mt. Sinai icon; Kitzinger, "On Some Icons of the Seventh Century," 132ff., pl. Ig; C. Bertelli, La Madonna di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome, I961. 66 Cynewulf is understood by some scholars as Mercian and his work attributed to 750-850 A.D.: K. Sisam, Studies in the History of Old English Literature, Oxford, 1953, iff.; M. Deanesly, The Pre-Conquest Church in England, New York, i96i, 263ff. Another theory - one particularly attractive in regard to our study - is that he may have been Bishop Cynewulf of Lindisfarne who died ca. 782; cf. G. Anderson, The Litera- ture of the Anglo-Saxons, Princeton, 1966, 125, 149, n. 26. For many years the poem Christ was thought to be entirely by Cyne- wulf, but informed opinion today categorically assigns only Ascension to him. Advent and Last Judgment may or may not be his but are certainly Cynewulfian, showing no obvious departures in style. Several scholars have discovered in the three parts of Christ a unity of arrangement and content. The association of the main ideas may have led to simultaneous composition or at least to a combination of the three poems in one manuscript. See C. Schaar, Critical Studies of the Cynewulf Group (Lund Studies in English, xvii), Copenhagen, 1949; J. C. Campbell, The Advent Lyrics qf the Exeter Book, Princeton, 1959, viiff.

Church of Saint Anthony in the Desert (from Leroy, Monks and Monasteries of the Near East, pl. opp. p. 48) disposition of the pictures at Wearmouth described by Bede indicate a keen Anglo-Saxon interest in the Incarnation- Judgment theme and suggest an interpretation for the St. Cuthbert engravings: the artist or artists responsible for the decoration of the shrine drew inspiration from a model in which Incarnation, Ascension and Judgment (Majesty) themes were presented, and had to fit this demonstration to the shape of a coffin. Accordingly, the Virgin supporting the Child, engraved on the side of the coffin below the feet of the standing Christ, is the iconographic sign of Incarna- tion. Her axial position and the placement of the twelve apostles on one of the long sides - that is to say, on the same level - also allude to the Ascension. The nimbed Savior on the lid is, of course, the heavenly Christ; surrounded by the apocalyptic beasts who symbolize the Evangelists, He represents the Christ of the Second Coming and Last Judgment. (In this view archangels were undoubtedly present in the model consulted for the basic program, but as a set of seven they may represent an insertion from a separate and peripheral archangel list.) In doctrinal terms the essential synthesis presented here is that of Incarnation and Theophany. The historical Jesus who took human flesh from His human mother and is fully man is united with the heavenly Christ, the eternal son of God who reveals himself to His disciples. Philosophically He is the Logos, the Creative Word who becomes incarnate in the man Jesus of Nazareth, and the Virgin, in these terms, symbolizes the Church, bearer of the Word Incarnate. Thus, among other things, the images on the coffin are meant to express the human-celestial nature of Christ and the redemptive descent and ascent of the Logos - Holy Spirit. Significantly, the apsidal frescoes of Bawit, discussed earlier in relation to the typology of the Virgin of Kells, offer the closest pre-Iconoclastic parallels for the complex imagery engraved on the coffin. They are devoted to the liturgical Majesty, that unique synthesis of historical, mystical and liturgical elements Grabar has called "un vrai alliage d'6Clments divers, le rapprochement s'6tait fait sur le theme de la th6ophanie."67 The compositional frame- work, the "scaffold" for these Coptic paintings, is borrowed from the iconography of the historical Ascension, but insertions dependent on the visions of Isaiah, Ezekiel and John, the writings of Jerome and apocryphal and liturgical sources, radically alter the original meaning of the scene. Divided into two levels, these apsidal frescoes always feature, in the upper zone, Christ, enthroned in an aureole, above the chariot of Isaiah. He is accompanied by the four beasts of Revelation68 (almost certainly also to be understood as symbols of the Evangelists),69 symbols of the sun and moon and crown-carrying archangels, Michael and Gabriel. Most often, the Virgin appears below, alone or holding the Child, between groups of apostles. In Chapel 42, for instance, the lower register features an enthroned Galakto- trophousa, while in Chapel 6 the enthroned Hodegetria is placed on the axis of the apse under the vision of the heavenly Christ (Fig. 20).70 The litany appearing on the 67 A. Grabar, Martyrium, 11, 210o. 68 A common aspect of the liturgy, whatever the differences between the Early Christian churches, is to preface the eucharistic prayer with an evocation of God in His Glory surrounded by His celestial army in- cluding seraphim who chant the hymn of Trisagion, inspired by the vision of Isaiah. The Oriental liturgists add to this vision the four "living creatures" who surround the throne in Ezekiel (1:5-14) and John (4:4-8) - the angel, lion, ox and eagle. Apocalyptic literature plays a significant role in Early Christian Egypt and can be seen to have influenced the Bawit frescoes. Here, the beasts accompanying Christ are no longer the Ezekielian tetramorph but four separate creatures, the six-winged creatures of the Apocalypse of St. John. The Book of Revela- tion became part of the Alexandrian canon long before it was recognized at Constantinople, and this interest is reflected in the decoration of medieval churches such as that of Saint Simon near Aswan where Christ and the four Beasts appear in a chapel fresco accompanied by the twenty-four elders of the Apocalypse (U. Monneret de Villard, II monastero di S. Simone presso Aswdn, I, Milan, 1927, fig- 7). See G. Mueller, Lexicon Athanasianum, Berlin, 1952, for references to Apocalyptic litera- ture in Egypt. Further: F. E. Brightman, Eastern Liturgies, 1896, 323. 69 The four Evangelist symbols and the Evangelists themselves appear on the "Throne of St. Mark," a stone reliquary that A. Grabar, "La 'Sedia di San Marco' 'a Venise," Cahiers archeologiques, vII, 1954, I9ff., has suggested may be of 6th-7th-century Coptic origin. It is also noteworthy that the I Ith-12th-century apse fresco in the White Monastery near Sohag pictures Christ and the four creatures accompanied by medallions containing portraits of the seated Evangelists (U. Monneret de Villard, Les Couvents pres de Sohag, ii, Milan, 1926, 132ff., fig. 201). Cf. Werner "Four Symbols Page," 9ff.; L.

Because of this and other liturgical references it is clear that these chapel paintings are closely associated with the central act of Christian worship. They have a function analogous to the Anaphora, the principal prayer in the Eucharistic Liturgy (which is sometimes inscribed on the walls of Coptic chapels). Recited during the consecration of the bread and wine, the Anaphora calls forth the Logos, the Virgin and the multitude of angels, apostles and saints. Therefore, building upon the pictorial structure of the Ascension, the Copts added elements which transformed the historical scene into a composition with complex dogmatic references and eucharistic purpose - the liturgical Majesty.72 Within these compositions the employment of Galaktotrophousa or Hodeget- ria beneath the celestial Christ is clearly expressive of the Incarnation doctrine.

Church of Saint Anthony in the Desert (from Piankoff, "Saint Antoine," pl. x) Thus, at Bawit, several frescoes represent the Virgin and Child of Incarnation within a composition which, among other things, refers to the historical Ascension and alludes to the Second Coming announced at the moment of Ascension.73 If we have been correct in our analysis of St. Cuthbert's coffin, the program proposed as inspiring the disposition of its images must have been remarkably similar to that of these Coptic paintings.74 Whether the Lindisfarne artist was acquainted with the components of a liturgical Majesty assigned to the separate parts of a decorated chest or casket, or had to accommodate the themes introduced within a single, self-contained composi- tion to the shape of his coffin, knowledge of a liturgical Majesty presentation would help to explain the position of most of the subjects engraved on the work. Despite the detachments imposed by the artist's apparent wish to have each board present a particular subject, thematic unity is preserved.

Ihm, Apsismalerei, 47ff., has proposed that the liturgical Majesty type featuring the Madonna originated in Coptic Egypt as a natural consequence of the popularity of apocalyptic literature. In the Byzantine world such an interest does not manifest itself in monumental art at an early date; even representations of Christ within an apocalyptic setting are almost unknown. An exception is the apse mosaic of Hosios David, Salonika (W. F. Volbach, Early Christian Art, London, I96I, pls. 133-35), variously dated between the 5th and the 7th centuries. It has been compared with the liturgical Majesty frescoes at Bawit and Latmos, and interpreted as reflecting the influence of Oriental iconography. Cf. R. H. Hoddinott, Early Byzantine Churches in Macedonia and Southern Serbia, London, 1963, I73ff.; M. Restle, Byzantine Wall Painting, I, 79. See also J. Leroy, Les manuscrits syriaques a" peintures conservis dans les bibliotheques d'Europe et de Orient, Paris, 1964, I, 219ff. for a discussion of the Oriental origin of apocalyptic imagery.</page><page sequence="18">18 THE ART BULLETIN IV !\ * ?r 24 Oliphant with Christ Enthroned above Virgin c(detail). Paris, Cluny Museum 25 Oliphant (detail). Paris, Cluny Museum arrangement of images echoes the grouping by opposition (God in heaven - God incarnate) of the Bawit liturgical Majesty compositions. Conceivably, as with other of the figures and groups engraved on the sarcophagus, the iconographic type fol- lowed for the Virgin and Child may be unrelated to that introduced within an imported liturgical Majesty composi- tion. This seems unlikely. Presumably the Kells and St. Cuthbert Mother and Child groups depend upon a rare variant of the seated Hodegetria created in Coptic Egypt. The arrangement of images on the coffin also seems to reflect Coptic inspiration. Therefore we may suppose that the Madonna and Child and the complex dogmatic setting within which it is employed on St. Cuthbert's coffin have a common iconographic source. The Christian East provides further evidence in support of this possibility. The Pantocrator Cave at Latmos, in Asia Minor, contains a liturgical Majesty presentation which includes the enthroned Galaktotrophousa cited earlier for its possible use of the complementary-profiles device. Placed in the upper zone of the apse, the fresco of Christ in Glory resembles the celestial visions appearing at Bawit, except that Hieronymian elements are now more strongly empha- sized; the four creatures surrounding the Savior are no longer the winged busts of the Bawit paintings but individu- alized animals carrying codices. The Virgin and Child group appears in the lower zone within an aedicula flanked by apostles or saints.75 We recall that the seated Galakto- trophousa and seated Hodegetria descend from intimately related prototypes. Therefore, the Latmos Galaktotrophousa, in its liturgical Majesty setting, serves nearly as well as a non-lactant Virgin type to emphatically underline the possibility that the program which inspired the juxta- position of images on St. Cuthbert's coffin included a representation of Jesus seated across His mother's angled lap.76 All this is relevant to an assessment of the relation between the Virgin and Christ Majesty pages in the Book of Kells. The Kells and St. Cuthbert Virgin representations together constitute a typological locution unprecedented in the Latin West, but with associations in the art of Coptic Egypt and related Oriental centers. Further, the Lindisfarne Madonna and Child is an essential element in a complex exposition independently demonstrating connections with 7s Because the iconographic juxtaposition of the Latmos frescoes - the Galaktotrophousa enthroned beneath the apocalyptic Christ - is found nowhere else in the Greek sphere, there can be little doubt that the paintings were inspired by Oriental and probably Coptic precedent. Comparison with the apse frescoes at Bawit makes this obvious, and Restle, Byzantine WIall Painting, I, 78, cites as evidence of iconographic connection the frontispiece in a Coptic manuscript of 9o6 A.D. (Pierpont Morgan Lib. MS 6oo00) where the Galaktotrophousa is enthroned below an image of the Savior surrounded by medallions containing portraits of the Evangelists. See Werner, "Four Symbols Page," 9; Cramer. Koptische Buchmalerei, 59ff. 76 There are some similarities between the liturgical Majesty frescoes of Bawit and Latmos and contemporaneous apse mosaics in the Latin sphere - i.e., in the Basilica Eufrasiana, Parenzo and the Lateran Baptistery (Ihm, Apsismalerei, 167, pl. xv [2], 144, pl. xxiii [2]), but the Parenzo mosaic lacks Evangelist symbols and the Lateran mosaic employs an orant Virgin alone, without the Child. None of these early Latin compositions features the complementary-profiles Madonna and Child type.</page><page sequence="19">BOOK OF KELLS I 19 Coptic Egypt. Since the Kells Virgin is so closely associated with that engraved on the reliquary and at the same time is employed in a Gospel Book which includes a picture of the Enthroned Christ, the possibility presents itself that our Insular miniatures (folios Ir, 32v, 7v) may be the detached and dispersed units of a single demonstration not unlike that appearing on the coffin from Lindisfarne. If the three symbolic illustrations in the Book of Kells should prove to be derived from an exemplar in which they were brought together, this would not mean that they directly depend on the presentation underlying the arrange- ment of subjects on St. Cuthbert's coffin, or on the coffin engravings themselves. Rather, as we shall attempt to demonstrate, the Kells miniatures most probably were taken from a cycle of symbolic picture pages. The know- ledge of such a cycle would explain certain departures from the liturgical Majesty representations we have analysed - this because a codex setting imposes qualities of composi- tional self-containment on even the most thematically related images when such images are distributed over several leaves. Nevertheless, the transposition of units of a liturgical Majesty composition into picture pages does not explain an important aspect of the Kells presentation. If folios 32v and Ir were taken from a lajestas Domini model, the latter must have been somewhat different in type from the Christ in Glory representations at Bawit, Latmos, etc., for instead of showing the Savior surrounded by orthodox animal symbols, it pictured bizarre animal-headed symbols presenting their Gospels to Jesus. Very little has been written on the problem of the origin of Majesty compositions with zoanthropomorphic symbols of the Evangelists. A number of scholars have devoted attention to the more circumscribed question of the origin of the symbols themselves and several have suggested that the type was a product of Coptic invention, an adaptation of the pharaonic animal-headed deity.77 The recent publi- cation of a little-known late-medieval Coptic fresco seems to confirm this judgment. The apse of a small chapel attached to the south side of the narthex of the church of Saint Anthony in the Desert contains a well-preserved painting of eleventh- to thirteenth-century date. It shows the Pantocrator seated on a richly decorated throne supported by four angels. Full-length, winged, zoanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols appear in groups of two on either side. They reach out toward the Savior (Figs. 21-23). Images of the standing Virgin and St. John introduce the Deesis theme and complete the composition.7" The Saint Anthony chapel fresco not only proves that the animal-headed symbol type was known in Coptic Egypt during the Middle Ages but that it was employed within the framework of the Majestas. Of course, the Coptic fresco was created several centuries after our Insular miniatures.

Happily, there are a number of medieval compositions which not only demonstrate the existence of an iconographic ensemble of subjects similar to that which appears when the three Kells symbolic folios are juxtaposed, but suggest that this arrangement was invented in Early Christian Egypt. One of the most interesting of these representations is carved on an eleventh-century oliphant in the Cluny Museum (Figs. 24-25). A rectangular frame encloses the Enthroned Christ who carries a large cross-scepter. Six flying angels support His circular mandorla and above are the sun and moon while below, the orant Virgin, standing beneath an arch, is flanked by two standard-bearing angels.

Two of these bands contain busts of the twelve apostles. The third encloses the 77 E. Mile, L'art religieux du XIIe sidcle en France, 6th ed., Paris, 1953, 5; L. B.

Significantly, similar compositions appear outside the medieval Latin sphere - they are often used to decorate late medieval Ethiopic Gospel Books. The famous fifteenth- century Kebran Gospels, for example, contains an extensive cycle of the Life of Christ which includes a most unusual "Ascension" page (Fig. 26).81 The miniature is divided into two tiers with an ascending Christ in a mandorla above, the apostles and the Virgin witnessing the event, below. How- ever, instead of angels, as in the orthodox Oriental Ascension, four full-length winged and clothed zoanthropo- morphic symbols support Christ's aureole. Inscriptions identify the composition as an Ascension and the four strange creatures as symbols of the Gospel authors. There is evidence to suggest that the animal-headed Evangelist symbol type was introduced from Egypt to Ethiopia by the thirteenth century.82 This fact and the connections between the Cluny oliphant and tenth-century Coptic works seem to point clearly to Early Christian Coptic Egypt as the center of origin for the unusual Ascension variant which appears on the south Italian ivory and later in Ethiopic miniatures. To be sure, the Cluny ivory and the Kebran page display the orant Madonna rather than the enthroned Mother and Child in association with the zoanthropomorphic creatures. Nevertheless, because of their employment of the Ascension as the vehicle for this conjunction, they indicate the exist- ence of a Coptic formula capable of accommodating a seated Virgin and Child type and the bizarre heavenly beings. We recall that at Bawit the seated Hodegetria and Galaktotrophousa are interchangeably introduced into the same dogmatic setting as the standing Madonna - sur- rounded by apostles beneath the image of Christ, the apocalyptic beasts, and angels in heaven. The substitution of animal-headed symbols for the four winged beasts above 14 . 27 Stone slab, Madonna and Child. Cathedral of Brechin, Scotland (from J. S. Richardson, The Mediaeval Stone Carvers of Scotland, pl. '4) the enthroned Mother and Child group in these liturgical Majesty frescoes would create an iconographic ensemble at once closely related to that in the south Italian and Ethiopic works cited above and strikingly similar to the demonstra- tion discovered through a juxtaposition of the three symbolic illustrations in the Book of Kells. This iconographic exposition, the result of an assemblage of types created in Coptic Egypt, is not quite without parallel. An examination of two Western works of art reveals that its essential features were known to artists of the early Middle Ages. 79 In the pre-Carolingian West, zoanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols appear in Visigothic, Merovingian and Insular settings indicative of Oriental inspiration. See R. Crozet, "Les premieres representations anthropo-zoomorphiques des evangdlistes (VIe-IXe siecles)," Atudes merovingiennes, I, 1953, 53ff.; idem., "Les quatre dvangdlistes et leurs symboles," Les Cahiers techniques de l'art, Iv, 1962, 5ff.; S. Ameisenowa, "Animal-Headed Gods, Evangelists, Saints and Righteous Men," 21ff.; Werner, "Majestas Domini," 378ff.; idem., "Four Symbols Page," 3ff. Apart from the Cluny oliphant, one of the most interesting examples of a Majestas Domini with animal-headed symbols appears on a slab from Saint-Martin de Dume, now in the Braga Museum, Portugal. Its date is disputed. G. Gaillard, Deux sculptures fundraires provenant de Saint-Martin de Dume, Braga, 1956, assigns it a 6th-century Visigothic provenance, while H. Schlunk, "Ein Sarkophag aus Dume in Museum in Braga (Portugal)," Madrider Mitteilungen, ix, 1968, 424ff., places it in the i Ith century. It pictures the Savior (in a setting resembling that in a number of Early Christian Oriental Ascension scenes) between pairs of full- length zoanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols shown offering their Gospels to Him. G. de Francovich, "Osservazioni sull' altare di Ratchis a Cividale," 175ff., understands the Braga relief, the 7th-century Merovingian Jouarre sarcophagus and the 8th-century Ratchis altar to be stylistically and iconographically interrelated, and to depend on Oriental sources.

Another Ethiopian book of the same period from St. Arsina Dek contains a similar scene; ibid., pl. xxvii. 82 Our symbol type appears early in the history of medieval Ethiopian art. Each face of a stone altar in the crypt of Silleese at Bieta Golgata, Lalibela, is decorated with a relief of one of the animal-headed Evan- gelist symbols.

Lyon, Musee des Beaux Arts that the centrally placed Madonna and Child were framed by four zoanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols. The relief is completed by a bird in profile (the Holy Spirit?) in the crown head, and the heads of two nimbed figures on the base of the shaft - perhaps the Apostles Peter and Paul, for one of the two holds what appears to be a key. The Brechin slab is split in its thickness but its edges indicate carving on the opposite face. Conceivably, this face may have featured Christ in Glory. Be that as it may, even in its present state the slab presents an arrangement of elements - Madonna and Child, angels, zoanthropomorphic Evangelist symbols and (possibly) two of the apostles - similar to that in our hypothetical liturgical Majestas variant.84 Recently, it has been asserted that the Brechin slab was created by or dependent upon the direction of artists from Wearmouth- Jarrow.85 In the light of Bede's description of the paintings at Wearmouth and the testimony of the St. Cuthbert 83aJ.

A display related to that on the Brechin slab is found on the ivory knob of a bishop's staff assigned to eleventh- century Germany, in the Mus6e des Beaux-Arts, Lyon (Figs. 28-31) .86 It is a monument of particular relevance to our study, since it presents not only the groups carved on the Scottish slab, but an image of Christ in Glory. The seated Mother and Child group is enclosed by a medallion sup- ported by two angels. A second medallion (or mandorla) frames Christ seated on a globe, carrying a book and blessing. Pairs of full-length, clothed and winged zoanthro- pomorphic symbols extending their arms toward the Savior appear above and below. The two remaining figures, placed between the Mother and Child and Christ in Glory groups, resemble cherubim. Inscriptions are employed for each of the attendant figures; the two angels who support the Virgin's medallion and the two cherubic figures are identi- fied as the archangels Uriel, Gabriel, Michael and Raphael; the two zoanthropomorphic creatures to the left of the Savior are labeled Matthew and Mark, the two to the right are designated John and Luke.87 In several respects the Christ in Glory on the Lyon ivory recalls the apsidal fresco in the church of Saint Anthony in the Desert (Fig. 21). Both works show full-length zoanthro- pomorphic symbols with outstretched arms, offering obeisance to the centrally placed Savior. Four archangels also appear in both representations. On the ivory they are identified by inscriptions as the archangel group cited as probably inspiring the four angels in the Kells Madonna folio. The four - Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel - are linked to the four apocalyptic beasts of St. John's vision in the Ethiopian Mass,88 a liturgical association which may help to explain the contiguity of archangel and Evangelist symbol groups on the Latin ivory and in the Coptic paint- ing. (Significantly, our archangel set is accompanied by a set of Evangelist symbol busts in the Galaktotrophousa miniature in the thirteenth-century Spanish Charter of Santo Domingo [Fig. I2]). The Lyon knob proves the existence of a medieval iconographic exposition in which images of Christ in Glory, the Madonna and Child, the four archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel) and the zoanthropomorphic symbols of the Evangelists are juxtaposed. It also demon- strates that the theme of Incarnation expressed by the image of the Mother of God placed under the celestial vision could be interpreted through similar but not identical motifs and arrangements. The apostles are not present in the work, and the Virgin and Christ groups are placed across from each other, thereby reducing references to the Ascension, but the Madonna and Child image continues to be the iconographic sign of Incarnation within a composi- tion which represents much the same thing as the liturgical Majesty. The similarities between the principal subjects on the Lyon ivory and those separately represented in the Kells Gospels are immediately apparent. Together, the Christ on folio 32v and the bizarre creatures on folio lv form an unusual Majesty scene which in its essentials resembles that carved on the ivory. Both the Book and the knob employ an informal, enthroned Virgin and Child type,89 and, as we have learned, there is evidence which suggests that the angels on Kells folio 7v depend on a set of four archangels - the same set identified on the knob. The iconography of the Lyon ivory is unique. Nowhere else are all its elements assembled in a single composition. Yet, the three symbolic illustrations in Kells, when viewed as components of a single demonstration, clearly treat the same basic themes and with equivalent or identical types and groups. Accepting the similarities between the eleventh-century ivory and the Insular pictures as too complex and precise to offer the possibility of independent formulation, it seems reasonable to conclude that the Kells miniatures, although separated and autochthonously placed, and the Lyon images, were inspired by a common iconographic prototype most probably invented in Early Christian Coptic Egypt. Temple University 86 A. Goldschmidt, Die Elfenbeinskulpturen aus der zeit der karolingischen und sichsischen Kaiser, II, Berlin, 1918, 43, No. 138, assigns the ivory to the IIth century. Stylistically, it is related to the ivories of the Melk altar group, a series Goldschmidt finds to be indebted to "Byzantine" models. 87 This disposition is not in accordance with the most usual sequence of the Evangelist symbols surrounding a central figure of Christ in Latin medieval art. When read clockwise the symbols in such compositions conform to the Gospels sequence - Matthew, Mark, Luke, John. The Lyon arrangement is, however, that most frequently seen in Oriental Christ in Glory compositions: the Bawit and Saqqara chapel frescoes, the Pantocrator Cave, Latmos frescoes, the Ethiopian Ascension and Majesty scenes, etc. It is also the order followed by the strange Evangelist symbols placed in the interspaces of an interlaced cross on folio 2r in the Book of Durrow. This page was probably inspired by a Coptic symbolic Majesty scene with animal-headed Evangelist symbols. See Werner, "Four Symbols Page," 3ff. 88 See note 41 above. 89 Despite the fact the Child's legs are centered between the Virgin's knees on the Lyon ivory, the disposition of the pair (though reversed , approximates that of the Hodegetria variant in the Book of Kells. Inter- estingly, it is difficult to find contemporary Latin typological parallels for the I Ith-century group. An exception is the Galaktotrophousa in the 12th-century lintel of the church of Anzy-le-Duc (Musde du Hidron, Paray-le-Monial). Here again the Child sits across His mother's right knee. The Madonna turns toward Him offering her breast. (On the ivory, the Virgin seems to be holding an apple [or wafer?] but this detail is obscure.) The Anzy-le-Duc Galaktotrophousa is accompanied by saints, and appears below an enthroned Christ in a mandorla supported by two angels. E. MAle, L'art religieux du XIIe siecle en France, 1953, 33ff.. noted similarities between this arrangement and the juxtaposition of groups in the Bawit apse frescoes and concluded that the Romanesque relief depends on Oriental iconographic sources.
