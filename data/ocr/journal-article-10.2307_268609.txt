<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The "Georgics" of Virgil: A Critical Survey. By L. P. WILKINSON. Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1969. Pp. xii + 364. $12.50 (in U.S.A.). A book in English devoted solely to the Georgics has been long overdue. Chapters by Sellar and Otis and a series of recent seminal articles have readied the way. It is good that the challenge was accepted by a Latinist of the distinction of L. P. Wilkinson. If the final impression is a disappointing one, Wilkinson himself acknowledges and defends the critical limitations that make it such. He has care- fully collected much key material for opening the door to a wider horizon which he would have us but dimly glimpse. The groundwork is diligently laid. A chapter on the early life of Virgil offers a scrupulous (and healthy) re-examination of the ancient sources and includes a survey of Virgil's euvre up to the composition of the Georgics. The traditional allegories imposed on the Eclogues are paraded once again: Daphnis in 5 is Julius Caesar, the Menalcas of Eclogue 9 is Virgil. But there are noteworthy judgments. Eclogue 1 is a courageous poem (p. 33). A wise reading of Eclogue 4 depends on viewing correctly, as Wilkinson does, its relationship to Catullus 64 (pp. 35-36). For W. the "conception" of the Georgics is not political but literary. We are not to imagine any eminence grise delivering haud mollia iussa to suggest the revival of the small independent farmer as a suitable catalyst for inspiration. Rather, "It seems more likely that the impulse came from literature" (p. 56), namely Hesiod, Aratus, Lucretius, and Varro of Reate, to each of whom W. devotes some pages. Virgil's private muse is allowed minimal presence here. A chapter on "Composition and Structure" outlines the pattern of each of the four books. There are felicitous insights throughout, but the general introductory remarks are dubious. For instance, "The First and Third Books emnhasize hard work, are generally sombre in tone, and end with a catastrophe; whereas the Second and Fourth deal by contrast with work that is easier, are gay and lively in tone, and end happily" (pp. 74-75). (The same point concerning Book 2 is made again on pp. 87 and 191.) Is the work described at 2, 61 ff., or 397 ff., any easier than in the other books? There are what might be styled positive moments in Georgics 2---the marriage of Heaven and Earth, the praises of Italy. But Virgil is looking at farrners he calls ignorant of their prize (458 ff.) and at a land deserted by Iustitia (473-74). A golden age once existed in Italy when men were hardy. They had not yet heard trumpets braying or swords being forged. Throughout Book 2 the burden of reproof lies on the present. And can the totality of Georgics 4 be considered gay and lively? Wilkinson is misled (and mis- leading) when he proclaims Virgil's tempera- ment sanguine (p. 38). In a chapter devoted specifically to the Aristaeus episode of Book 4, W. (rightly, according to the majority of critics) dismisses Servius' story thaL it replaced laudes Galli. He finds the moment in Book 4, roughly at lines 281 ff., ripe for an aition on Bugonia. The presence of the contrasting Orpheus tale he leaves unexplained after dismissing the inter- pretation of Klingner as overly Germanic and that of Otis as "inflated and fanciful 'uplift.' " Two important chapters follow, one de- voted to philosophical, moral, and religious ideas, the other to political and social ideas. The theme of the first is twice sounded: "the dominant moral idea in the poem is that of the dignity of labour" (p. 132); "the overall message of the Georgics is, that labor may be improbus but is rewarded by divini gloria ruris" (p. 145). The reader tends to conflate these thoughts with a statement from the Introduction: "viewed as a whole, the pleasure and significance of the Georgics is most akin to that which may be derived from descriptive poetry, the literary counterpart of landscape- painting" (p. 14). The words "message" and 258</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 259 "significance" in such contexts will jolt any student possessing more than the most super- ficial sympathy with the Georgics. How do celestial cataclysms, butchering plagues, poets torn limb from limb lead to the reward of nature's bounty? If the Georgics are descrip- tive (what poetry is not ?), they describe eternal processes in nature and life, negative as well as positive, for which trees, beasts, and bees (and men too, for the poem is in large measure anthropomorphic, despite its ap- parent subject) are only the vehicles. In his chapter on political ideas W. ques- tions the validity of offering the bees' existence as a model for Augustan Rome. He wisely qualifies an earlier, too idealistic stance ("Their way of life is by nature exemplary," p. 101). Hard work and devotion to country and king are certainly noble traits. But in the world of the bees, as in the world of Rome, "kings" lead out opposing swarms. A handful of dust on all, and death to the leader of less worth, are easy remedies for civil war among bees because men purvey the cure. Jupiter could thus dispose of men, W. rightly suggests (p. 102). What he does not ponder is whether or not Octavian, one of the warring kings, will readily make the transition into a more lofty, even divine personage. The opening of the first book "is the first literary document to support the idea of the divinity of a living ruler at Rome" (p. 163). At the end of the fourth book Caesar magnus fulminat bello (4. 560-61). But the power of the Jovian thunder- bolt is a splendid device with which to make "peoples willing"-and cowed. Anyone aware of W.'s brilliant analysis of Georgics 1. 43-392 in Golden Latin Artistry (pp. 74-83) would have high expectations for the chapter on "Poetic Approach and Art." He will not be disappointed. It is when dealing with such matters as the particular niceties with which Virgil turns traditional material that W. seems most cogent. On questions of rhythm and sound, figures of speech, poetic and nonpoetic vocabulary he is constantly enlightening. The last two chapters on agricultural lore and the future Nachleben of the Georgics will be of more importance to historians of farming and of literature than to those whose interests lie with poetry, Latin or other. In summary, when dealing with questions of literary inheritance and influence and with historical background, when facing that pre- liminary task of a good critic, analysis of a poet's surface use and placement of language, W. seems at home. But his constant gibes at those who "interpret" unnecessarily, engage in flights of aesthetic fancy, fashion symbolism from every sow's ear, betray a certain lack of ease before (as well as respectable skepticism of) more recent forms of criticism. But that reader of poetry lulls himself into false security who claims that all we need to know to comprehend Ode to Autumn can be derived from Keats's contemporary letters (p. 7) or who allows the confines of ancient criticism to restrict his own appreciations (a worry on p. 72). We might as well read Shakespeare through the eyes of Puttenham alone. By avoiding deeper questions of tone and meaning in his author any critic will find any poem merely descriptive, and happily envision such a work as the Georgics as pleasant enter- tainment for a gentleman farmer, versified Varro. It is more than that. Like all great poetry it is a continuous metaphor for existence, pulsating with the rhythms of life and death. To the careful reader, literal nature becomes a constant symbol, revealing patterns of growth and decay, youth and old age, suffering and catharsis which spill over into the world of man. What of Orpheus, the quasi-divine poet with the power to tame death and yet the inability to control his own human furor? What of Aristaeus who must be initiated into the source of all earth's water and capture, physically, the miracula rerum? What of "Roman" bees, partly mirroring the gods but born into the world like Parthian arrows? What of thundering Octavian and Virgil's ignobile otium? Whatever the hazards such subjects cannot be dismissed or ignored by anyone striving to do justice to one of the greatest monuments of Roman literature. MICHAEL C. J.
