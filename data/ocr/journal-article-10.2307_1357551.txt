<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews La Transcaucasie au Ndolithique et au Chalco- lithique, by Christine Chataigner. BAR Interna- tional Series 624. Oxford: Tempus Reparatum, 1995. 240 pp., 72 figures, 9 tables. ?32.00. The mountainous isthmus between the Black and Cas- pian Seas, the northern borderlands of the ancient Near East, has long offered dei ex machina explanations for enigmatic archaeological phenomena to the south. For the southern Levant alone, various scholars have identified Transcaucasia as a factor in the origin of the Chalcolithic culture, the source of arsenical copper ores for Chal- colithic metalwork, a contributor to the beginning of the EB I, the origin of Khirbet Kerak pottery, and the source of EB IV people. Some of these theories remain plausible, probably even valid, while others are improbable or sim- ply fantastical. But even recent discussions betray a very fragmentary grasp of Transcaucasian archaeology, and Burney's review has long remained the standard reference (Burney and Lang 1971). A small but growing number of other works in western European languages-among them translations from the Russian-provide chronologically, geographically, or thematically focused reviews; but noth- ing has yet replaced Burney's scope of vision. Chataigner's work, her 1983 these de 3e cycle updated to include ref- erence through 1993, fits into this genre of focused re- views, in this case for the Neolithic and Chalcolithic of Transcaucasia as a whole. Faced with the organizational dilemmas endemic to syn- theses of this kind, Chataigner settles on a topical rather than geographical or chronological arrangement. The book opens with several preliminary matters-physical environ- ment, history of research, the chronological boundaries and radiocarbon evidence, and the distribution of sites through time with respect to landscape features and their grouping into "cultural" facies (chapters 1-4). Chataigner then treats in succession architecture, burials, pottery, metal objects and metallurgy, obsidian sources and circulation, tools of various materials, weapons, rock art, figurines and seal im- pressions, botanical remains, and animal bones (chapters 5-14). A final chapter then turns to the questions of Neo- lithic origin and transition to the Bronze Age. Brief En- glish summaries preface each chapter. A preface by J.-L. Huot opens the book, and several workmanlike indices appear after a reasonably complete bibliography.1 Chataigner's chosen organization highlights the evi- dence for each material or topic, at the cost of a perhaps unavoidably choppy presentation. She ably summarizes a large, unwieldy, and ultimately recalcitrant body of pub- lished information pertaining to her subject. In the absence of a fresh study of museum collections, the illustrations re- main the infuriating Soviet hodge-podge of irregular con- ventions and scales that often make unannounced changes within the same plate. Despite this nagging difficulty, Chataigner's emphasis on the material record creates the work's greatest strength. Unhappily, the same emphasis also abets the book's ultimate disappointment. Too much of the time, Chataigner has concealed the views and intu- itive conclusions that inevitably decide the organization and stresses in this kind of work. The basic issues of relative and absolute chronology illustrate the disappointment. Neolithic and Chalcolithic Transcaucasia can be divided into three broad zones. The Black Sea coastal lowlands (Colchis) held a scattered group of sites with a distinc- tive tradition of pottery decorated by incision. The central Kura drainage (Kvemo Kartli and western Azerbaijan) was home to the better known Shulaveri-Shomu group, where plastic decoration of pottery was more common. A dis- tinct culture complex, with a persistent tradition of painted decoration, appears along the Araxes drainage (and adja- cent portions of the lower Kura drainage) eastward from the Yerevan area (e.g., Tekhut) through Nakhichevan (e.g., Kyul-tepe) and the Karabakh-Mil steppe (e.g., Ilanly tepe) and the Mugan steppe (e.g., Alikemek tepesi). Two basic chronological problems exist: phasing within each of these zones, and the relationships between them. The sequence internal to the Shulaveri-Shomu group is key to regional chronology. Chataigner adopts Kiguradze's (1986) five-fold phasing of this group, but does not ex- plain why she finds Kiguradze's scheme preferable to other proposals and parts company with him over issues of external correlations. Cross-links with the Colchis group, although slender, are convincing, and the issues here are relatively uncomplicated. Greater problems exist for corre- lating the Araxes sites with the Shulaveri-Shomu sequence. Kiguradze assigns the Azerbaijani sites of the Shulaveri- Shomu group (including Shomu-tepe itself) to his Phase IV; correlates the lower levels at Kyul-tepe (with a few Halaf imports) with Phases IV-V or even later; and places other sites like Tsopi, Alikemek-tepesi, Ilanly-tepe, and Tekhut between the end of Phase V and the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (Kura Araxes culture). Kiguradze's argument has two crucial chronological consequences, ending the Shulaveri-Shomu around 5000 B.C. (the end of the Halaf) and placing most of the excavated sites in the Araxes zone (with the notable exception of Kyul-tepe) after this date.2 Chataigner's rearrangement of Kiguradze's scheme oc- curs without announcement, as table 3 of chapter 3. In this table, she phases the western Azerbaijani sites somewhat differently, placing Shomu in Phases II-III; adjusts sig- nificantly Kiguradze's interregional correlations, by align- ing Kyul-tepe with Phase II-III, Ilanly with Phase IV, 89</page><page sequence="2">90 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 306 Alikemek (lower levels) with Phase V, and Tekhut and Alikemek (upper levels) with Tsopi in post-Phase V; and assigns the 5000 B.C. date to the beginning of Phase IV rather than the end of Phase V. Chataigner points to sev- eral good ceramic parallels with northwest Iran that help corroborate Kiguradze's assignment of his post-Phase V material to 5000-3500 B.C.3 The point here is not to argue that Kiguradze is right and Chataigner wrong. Indeed, Chataigner's scheme enjoys the strength of better chosen, more precise external paral- lels with Iranian sites.4 The problem is that Chataigner writes as if the field is clear-having shown early on that considerable disagreement bedevils older views on relative phasing and chronological correlations and that the radio- carbon evidence is both scant and internally contradictory, she takes little further note of the existing debate. No- where providing an integrated argument for these views, Chataigner scatters comments through several chapters that seem to rest the chronological logic on the premises that 1) anthropomorphic decoration in relief on Shulaveri- Shomu sites indicates a late relative date; 2) the attribute of chaff tempering, red and cream slipping, and painted decoration form a horizon across southeastern Transcau- casia and into the middle Kura drainage; and 3) the red slipping and painted decoration bear a "family resem- blance" to wares in northwestern Iran. She would have better served the reader by presenting her reasoning in a single place, declaring why she adopts and adapts Kigur- adze's phasing of the Kvemo Kartli sites and indicating where and why she alters Kiguradze's correlations with the Araxes sites. In addition to this lack of explicitly developed argu- ments, the book suffers from missed opportunities. The issue of trade and interregional contacts provides an ex- ample. Recent analytic results suggest that obsidian circu- lated within circumscribed areas that loosely correspond to the two main ceramic provinces. At the same time, the previously mentioned foreign parallels and imports, how- ever few or hazily perceived, point to interaction with out- side regions.5 Chataigner suggests that its Halaf connection was responsible for the relatively common appearance of copper and arsenical copper objects in the lower levels at Kyul-tepe (and, conversely, attributes the almost total dis- appearance of metal in the later levels the reorientation towards the Azerbaijan steppes and northwest Iran); sim- ilarly, she relates the appearance of arsenical copper met- allurgy at Tekhut to the CUbaid connection. She seems inclined to attribute metallurgical florescence to imports or metal workers from the south (explicitly suggested on p. 134), an ironic reversal of the more usual view of Trans- caucasia as a hearth of early metallurgical innovation.6 These sometimes tendentious views point toward an integrated interpretation of cultural change. But Chataigner offers only scattered fragments of her potentially impor- tant vision of the Transcaucasian Chalcolithic world. A concluding chapter designed to assemble this interpreta- tion would have integrated the book more effectively than its disjointed topical organization now permits. Even with these missed opportunities, Chataigner's book provides a useful source of information about Transcaucasia during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic. One can only regret that in its present form, the reader must work so hard to dig out the nuggets of gold.

An earlier essay (Chataigner 1989) modestly goes without mention. 2Several sites in the Mil steppe appear to be earlier (Neolithic), presenting painted sherds with parallels to Hajji Firuz phase materials of northwestern Iran. 3To the north, mounting radiocarbon evidence places the beginning of the Maikop culture fairly early in the fourth millennium, which then provides a point of refer- ence for late Chalcolithic Transcaucasian sites like Tsopi and Berikldeebi, where Maikop parallels appear (Trifonov 1994, whose absolute chronology is roughly the same as Chataigner's). 4These include in the Kura drainage, a vessel at Ilanly similar to Dalma Impressed, red slipped ware(s) at vari- ous sites perhaps comparable to Yanik Red Slipped Ware and Pisdeli Red Ware, a rim form at Tsopi with good Geoy M parallels; in the Araxes drainage, painted deco- ration at Alikemek that fits into the Geoy M range. A figured stamp seal from Arukhlo I belongs to a style that hesitantly appeared in late Halaf contexts and became com- mon in Northern CUbaid (Breniquet 1984); its appearance at Arukhlo probably does require extending Phase V into the fifth millennium B.C., but this is the only direct evi- dence for a lower date of the Shulaveri-Shomu group. A similar but not identical figure appears on a cylinder seal from Grave 4 of the Krasnogvardeisk mound of the early Maikop culture to the north, showing that the motif ex- tends well into the fourth millennium B.C. 50ther relatively rare goods, such as turquoise, car- nelian, marble, and bitumen were also in circulation. The turquoise, at least, came from a considerable distance (probably the Central Asian rather than the Sinaic sources). Chataigner seems uninterested in these rarer materials and does not explore their implications for long-distance contact.</page><page sequence="3">1997 BOOK REVIEWS 91 6The theme of stimulus contact might continue later as well-Leila tepe in the Karabakh steppe reputedly yielded an Uruk-style wall cone (Trifonov 1994: 357), in the twi- light of the Chalcolithic when the Kura-Araxes (Eastern Transcaucasian Culture) was forming.
