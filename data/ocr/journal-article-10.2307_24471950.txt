<plain_text><page sequence="1">MEN'S LIVES A review by Nan Richardson Men's Lives: The Surfmen and Baymen of the South Fork. Text by Peter Mat thiessen, with historical and contempo rary photographs. Published by Random House, New York, 1986 ($29.95). A two-volume deluxe edition was privately published by the Rock Foundation, 1986. ($200.00) Available through Aperture. Men's Lives evokes an incontrovertible sense of place, of time long gone, hung on the dry bones of fact. An encounter with a culture being liquidated by pres sures on both the land and the sea, it is a peculiarly full and rich book, filled with heroic portraits of the descendants of the original English and Dutch colonizers and whalers of old, who challenged the order of creation on the deep, as their descendants do now. With its vivid and exact language and relentless narrative and its potent photographic imagery, Men's Lives conveys a wide horizon, an enlarged imagination that grew from the intersection of five very distinct worlds. The chief protagonist of the book is an almost anthropomorphic nineteenth century nature, whose voice speaks in the cycles of waves and fog that engulf the world of the fishermen, a nature ruthless in what it offers or takes away. The im ages of abundance and force in the pic tures illustrate that same restless mag nitude, and the roll and sweep of the text conjures less an essay than an epic poem. It is a nature ambiguous in character: both the wild and treacherous sea of the cover photograph by Dan Budnik, where a dory veers against an immense dark wave, and the reflective serenity of Lynn Johnson's nesting swan are the stuff of myths, of a nature mediated and unrav eled through intuition alone. Pictures like the facing images by Danny Lyon and Doug Kuntz, of fishermen staring at a rough sea, wondering at its terror, its fabulousness, are at once fatalistic and merciless and peculiarly personal. One journey onto the sea ends only to begin another—all different and all the same. In the minute descriptions of the craft— setting the net, tying on the bag, winching and scraping—the pain of the work and the stalking and hunt it represents are vivid. In the face of Stuart Vorpahl wrenching at the oars (photographed by Dan Budnik) the struggle is engraved. The notes of homelessness, exile, aban donment are all sounded. One can almost hear Melville's Ishmael calling out that all that man ever found when he searched the waters was a reflection of himself. That brooding interrogation of nature is the refrain of Men's Lives. Against that backdrop, and in relation to it, the Bonackers (inhabitants of Aca bonack Creek) of the South Fork of Long Island are introduced. There is a certain fatalism in their story, as though they, like the schools of fish that have myste riously waxed and waned in the waters off Montauk Point, might follow in their wake.
