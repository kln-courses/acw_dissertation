<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS NEAR MAMOUSIA IN ACHAIA (PLATES 36-38) ABOUT four miles south of the modern railway station of Diakophto in Achaia, on a high saddle between the valleys of the rivers known to Colonel Leake as the Bokhusia and River of Kalavryta, just north of the modern village of Mamousia, are the remains of a small walled ancient city. Leake 1 supposed these ruins to be those of the ancient Achaean city of Keryneia: later the French Scientific Commission 2 in the Morea identified them with the town of Bura: Leake accepted this view, which prevailed generally until it was refuted by Professor Ernst Meyer of Zuirich in 1938." I was not at first inclined to accept all Professor Meyer's arguments; he has, however, courteously answered my objections, and a re-examination of the evidence has convinced me that he is right and that the ruins are indeed those of Keryneia. I visited the ruins at the end of I95o and in the foundations of a small building above the theatre discovered an antique bronze in the form of the head and neck of a goose. This I took to the National Museum in Athens, where it was cleaned and found to be of such interest that a small joint excavation by Mr. Zapheiropoulos, Ephor of Antiquities, and myself, was agreed upon.4 This excavation was carried out in May I951. Unfortunately Mr. Zapheiropoulos was unable to be present himself, but I had the benefit of the guidance of his experienced foreman, Mr. Andreas Mitropoulos. The appearance of the site before excavation suggested a fairly small rectangular building: investigation showed that the foundations extended considerably farther westward and that the remains were those of a small dwelling-house measuring some four metres north and south by ten metres east and west. Over this area the hillside, which slopes from north to south and is formed of a soft rock under a thin covering of soil, has been cut away to make a level platform. South and west of this the ground falls away very sharply, particularly at the north-west corner. Above the house, to the north, the slope rises more gently. The foundations of the house are set upon the rock platform: they are built of roughly cut blocks of the local stone, of varying size, set loosely in dried mud. They are nowhere more than two courses high: the mound of earth and tile which covered the centre of the site suggests that the walls were built mainly of mud brick. The foundations of the north and east walls were set upon the top of the rock cutting, which in the north-east corner is 1.50 m. deep (FIG. I, A-A; PLATE 37, b). The ground floor of the house (see plan, FIG. I) contained three rooms. x Travels in the Morea III 182 if. 2 Boblaye, Recherches Giographiques sur les Ruines de la Morde 26 ff.

As I am now converted to Professor Meyer's opinion, I will content myself with referring the reader to his book for a fuller description of the site and an account of the literary evidence. * I would like to express my thanks to the Oxford Craven Committee, whose generosity enabled me to pay my share of the expenses, and to the Students and Governing Body of Christ Church, in particular to Mr. R. H. Dundas. Of the many people who have helped me with advice and in other ways I must make particular mention of Mr. J. M. Cook, Director of the School, Mrs. S. Karouzou and Mr. Zapheiropoulos, of the Greek Archaeological Service, and Miss S. Benton, who first suggested to me the idea of a topographical survey of Achaia. The plans are the work of Mr. G. U. S. Corbett of King's College, Cambridge. The sections of pots were drawn by Miss Audrey Petty, and I owe the photographs of the bronzes to the kindness of the authorities of the National Museum. I would also like to express my gratitude to Mr. Alexander Theophanopoulos, of Mamousia, for his hospitality on numerous occasions.</page><page sequence="2">EXCAVATIONS NEAR MAMOUSIA IN ACHAIA S E C T ION B-B Bath SECTION A-A NETUt/;. r#r~~_.Fo _,Q _it "c r s. .I Pt0  SECTION C-C N Burled Drain SI, Bath Pithos A BATH ROOM .4: STORE ROOM STABLE C Pithos B Pit A C Pit B- Pit C Trench B &lt;. oWl FIG. I.-PLAN AND SECTIONS OF THE HOUSE NEAR MAMOUSIA 155</page><page sequence="3">156 J. K. ANDERSON (i) The Storeroom. At the east end was the largest, measuring internally 3'50 x 6o20 m. This appears to have been a store-room. It contained two large pithoi, the first (' Pithos A ') (PLATE 37, a) almost complete, the second (' pithos B') much broken.5 These pithoi had originally been set upright in shallow pits cut in the rock (fragments of pottery under Pithos A, one of which joined with a piece lying on the floor, show that it was not in its normal position when found). Three similar pits (Pits A, B, and C) had been cut in the floor at the east end, but the jars which they presumably once held had been removed some time before the house was abandoned. At the bottom of Pit B, resting on a small piece of broken tile, were a pair of iron tongs and a small cast bronze cockle-shell.6 This pit also contained a solid bronze knucklebone. Each of the other pits contained one bronze cockle-shell. Two shallow trenches (A and B, FIG. I) had been cut into the rock along the west and south sides of the room. Trench A contained numerous scraps of lead (apparently once used in riveting together large pots) and a number of large disc loomweights. There were very few loomweights elsewhere, and it seems certain to me that the loom actually stood here. The purpose of Trench B is not clear: it can hardly have been intended to take the foundations of the south wall and may be no more than an extension of the pit containing Pithos B. The fill above the floor contained numerous fragments of pottery and also the cake stamp,' besides a few unimportant scraps of bronze. The bronze goose's head came from the upper fill of the south-east corner of this room. The upper level of the fill, particularly the mound covering Pithos A, contained many broken pieces of tile. The presence of numerous sherds in the fill of the 'pits' and 'trenches' similar to those higher in the fill seems to show that these pits were open until the time when the house was abandoned. (2) The Bathroom. West of the Storeroom was a smaller room, measuring 2"35 x 3'50 m. (PLATE 36). Its principal feature is a cement bath (PLATE 36, b) built into the north-east corner against the scarped face of the rock. This consists of two small basins. The larger measures 1Io2 x 0o68 m. At the east end is a seat 0.32 m. broad and o"19 m. high. The west end is rounded and has in its floor a circular sump (diam. 0"27, depth o0. Io m.) from which a hole leads into a drain. This drain runs along the north wall of the room and out under the north-west corner, where it turns sharply south and continues along the west side of the wall between the bathroom and stable. Inside the bathroom it is completely covered in with a row of large rough stones irregularly set. The south side of the bath is broken, but does not appear to have been much more than 0.25 m. deep. There is no trace of any mechanical filling device, and it seems that the person having the bath sat on the step and had water poured over him in the Homeric manner. This must have caused a lot of splashing, whose effects were guarded against by covering the north part of the bathroom floor with cement. The cement floor is badly broken, but there seem to have been two shallow and irregular steps leading down from north to south (FIG. I, Section B-B; FIG. 7, C). The purpose of the small basin next the west end of the bath is not clear. Its greatest internal dimensions are 0o35 x 0o25 x 0o20 m. deep. There is no arrangement for draining it. There was no sign that it was fitted with a lid to guard against splashing, but I think it likeliest that it was a box for toilet necessities. The earth fill of the bathroom contained many pieces of tile and sherds, mostly from deep plates. (3) The Stable. At the west end of the house was a small enclosure, whose south and 6 The base of Pithos B was similar to that from the 'Pyramid' of Ligurio in the Argolid published by Scranton, Hesperia VII 533-4 and fig. 5- 6 A fuller description and discussion of the finds is reserved till later. ' See below, no. 41.</page><page sequence="4">EXCAVATIONS NEAR MAMOUSIA IN ACHAIA I57 east sides only are preserved. This seems to have measured 2"75 x 3'50 m. It contained a layer of blackened earth nearly a foot deep in which were very few sherds and no pieces of tile except at the east end. There was also one animal's tooth and one bronze coin. The blackening was not, to the best of my judgement, caused by burning, as there were no scraps of ash or charcoal on the ground. The drain from the bathroom led along the east side of this enclosure: it was originally covered in, but I dug out the southern half of it (PLATE 36, c). This was formed of two gutter tiles laid, the upper overlapping the lower, in a shallow trench. The tiles were originally o.96 m. long: the breadth tapered from 0o36 to 0-24 m. The depth of the gutter was o. II m. The gutter tiles of the roof apparently were of the same size, though they were so smashed that I failed to reconstruct a whole one from the fragments. The drain had been covered with similar tiles, but these were completely smashed. The wall between the bathroom and the stable was much ruined but certainly continuous. The evidence for calling this enclosure a stable is as follows: (a) It was not roofed with tile, and so formed no part of the main house. (b) But the dark earth (of quite a different colour from the natural soil and the fill of the other rooms) shows that it was occupied in some way, and in a rather different way from the rest of the house. (c) The dark earth is not just rotted household rubbish: a midden would have contained many more sherds and probably bones. (d) In this rough country mules and donkeys provide the only means of transport: I see no reason to doubt that they were much needed in antiquity, and if so they must have been stabled somewhere. The ground plan of the house is certainly complete. The sharp fall of the ground to the south and west makes it impossible that once there were more buildings on these sides. There is no room to the east, and a trial trench on the north revealed nothing but native rock under a thin covering of barren soil. On the other hand, in the rooms I excavated there was no sign of a hearth, and the store- room was full of jars and the loom. It therefore seems to me that there must have been an upper floor, where the inhabitants of the house cooked, ate, and slept. The typical village house today in this part of the country has two floors: the lower is used as a storeroom and stable and does not communicate directly with the upper one, which is reached by an outside wooden staircase. Here the family live, warming themselves and cooking at an open hearth, on either side of which are the raised wooden platforms which serve as beds by night and seats by day. There is often a second room with a somewhat finer bed, for the head of the household or for guests. I have yet to find a bath. If our house was similarly arranged, the rooms on the ground floor will have been reached through doors corresponding with the gaps in the south wall (see plan, FIG. I). This arrangement seems to me most probable, though I could find no trace of thresholds or door jambs (probably these were made of wood, but one might have expected at least a post hole). But the south wall is very ruined and the gaps may be accidental. The upper storey would be reached by a wooden stair on the north or uphill side. Here the rock has already been cut away to a depth of more than a metre, and only a short flight of steps would be needed. THE POTTERY 8 Only one vessel (the cup no. 12 below) was found complete. It was lying at the bottom of Trench B. The remainder of the pottery was smashed and scattered about the floor, mostly in the storeroom. Although the pottery was all broken, there was much more of it than 8 Homer A. Thompson, 'Two Centuries of Hellenistic Pottery', Hesperia III 311 f., is referred to as ' Thompson'.</page><page sequence="5">158 J. K. ANDERSON might reasonably be supposed to have accumulated in odd corners while the house was still occupied; even the most careless of housewives might be expected to sweep her floors occasionally. There was no stratification. I believe therefore that the pottery found was more or less what was in the house at the time of its abandonment, being broken either at the time or when the roof fell in. Apart from this broken pottery there are no very obvious marks of violence: the house was certainly not burned. The following pieces could be reconstructed sufficiently to deserve illustration (PLATE 37, c-d; FIGS. 2-5). I- i o. Plates. The most common pots from the excavation are small, deep plates. They are very poorly finished. The inside is covered with inferior glaze, varying in colour from dull red to black-brown. One or two pieces may be deliberately attempting a red glaze in imitation of Pergamene and similar fabrics, but I think that the variations in colour are accidental and I have not therefore listed these plates separately. No. Io is certainly of a different fabric from the others. For profiles, see FIG. 2. I. H. o0o5; D. o'I85. About one-quarter of plate. Yellowish clay. High base ring. Lip turned slightly out.

Three very similar lamps (to judge from the illustration) were found in the latest of the Hellenistic tombs at Sparta excavated by Wace and Dickins.13 This tomb (C III) contained a coin of Eurycles, ruler of Sparta at the end of the first century B.c., though as there were three skeletons in C III the grave goods found with them are not necessarily all of one period.'4 At all events this type of lamp would appear to have continued in use at Sparta well into the first century B.c., if not later. There does not seem to be any evidence for lamps of Type X at Corinth in the Roman period, but Corinth was then a Roman colony and imported Italian lamps.'5 Coarse Ware. 34. Amphoras. Fragments of at least four amphoras were found lying about the storeroom: they had probably been smashed before the roof fell in, as the pieces were scattered; in consequence it has not been possible to reconstruct a complete amphora.

Only the tip of the beak was showing, the neck being wedged between the fallen stones of the house at the south-east corner of the Storeroom. There was no deposit farther up the slope from which it could have been washed down, and I am quite certain that it formed part of the contents of the house. It does not, of course, follow that it is contemporary with the other contents, and indeed the various scholars who have kindly given me their opinions on it 18 are unanimous in assigning it to the Late Archaic period. Such a piece may have been handed down as an heirloom, or-more probably, as the family that lived in this cottage was certainly not a wealthy one--discovered in the fields, as many antiquities are discovered at this day or, if we assume on the strength of the cake stamps that the house was a priest's, it may have belonged to his temple. I cannot find an exact parallel to this handle. The treatment of the feathers recalls a 'Stilisierter Vogel' from the Temple of Zeus in Olympia.'9 That this piece is indeed early in date becomes more probable when it is compared with that illustrated beside it,20 PLATE 38, c, d. This is a small patera-handle ending in a ram's head. Total length o.014. Length of handle alone o.Io5; of head alone 0.035. D. of shaft o0o07. The handle consists of a cast copper cylinder with five shallow flutings running along each side: at the top and bottom a space about o0or broad is left unfluted. At each end the shaft is encircled by a raised band. The shaft is terminated by a ram's head: details of the horns and the groups of small circles which represent the wool on the top of the head and throat have been touched up after casting. The metal plate by which the handle was attached to the patera is in one piece with the shaft, but was beaten out and decorated with a curvilinear pattern after casting. Its corners are slightly broken. The four holes for the rivets by which it was fastened to the patera are visible in the photograph (PLATE 38, d). The metal is very coppery in appearance. There is no patina, but on the top of the shaft are traces of gilt. This type of handle was common throughout the civilised world during the Roman Imperial period. There is a fine example on a patera in the British Museum e1 from Boscoreale near Pompeii; inside the bowl is a representation of Scylla destroying the companions of Odysseus. From Borsu, Belgium,22 'une magniJfique patire en bronze dord avec manche cannel6 termind par une tite de bilier, dicorie au centre d'un bas-relief reprisentant un taureau dans l'attitude de combat '. Others come from Thrace,23 Egypt,'4 and Olympia,25 and there are many examples in museums; I do not attempt to give a full list. Gjodesen 2e suggests that these handles may be connected with the archaic anthropomorphic type which shows a youth standing on a ram's head, but it seems impossible to prove that they are directly derived from it.27 I have reluctantly abandoned the idea that they are intended to represent battering-rams, though a terracotta patera in Berlin is decorated inside with moulded arms and armour.'8 Rams are not the only animals whose heads are used on these handles: dogs and wolves are also found,'9 and even satyrs.30 Terracotta paterae with similar handles have been found in late Roman contexts in the Agora at Athens, showing that the type had a long life.31 Our piece is probably late, and seems to approach most closely to the Egyptian examples mentioned above. This has been a digression, but at least it helps to establish the early date of the goose by showing that it is not typical of the age to which the house belongs. 2. Cast bronze cockle-shell. L. 0oo45. Good condition; fine green patina like that of the goose; all the bronzes are covered with this patina, and I shall not mention it particularly in describing the remainder. The casting was excellently done, and the thickness of the bronze (about o000oo3) is uniform. The shell is obviously carefully copied from nature. Cockle-shells are very common in the soft rock of which the mountains of the North Peloponnese are formed, and the Achaean bronzeworkers, to whose activities Professor David M. Robinson has called attention in AJA XLVI I72 ff.,32 would not lack models. It is not improbable that all these bronzes were made locally, though I cannot prove it. FIG. 7, a. 3. Cast bronze cockle-shell. L. 0oo45. A replica of no. 2, slightly oxidised on the back. This shell contained traces of a lead filling which were removed in the cleaning. FIG. 7, a. 4. Cockle-shell. L. 0o05. This piece is merely a dome-shaped lump of lead about 0o02 m. high with a flat roughly circular bottom about 0o05 m. in diameter. Its upper surface has been roughly scored to represent the ridges on a cockle-shell and then covered with a thin bronze plate, which is now broken at the top of the shell. It is difficult to see what purpose it can have served: perhaps the three cockle-shells were the three feet of a bronze bowl; Hellenistic pottery bowls with cockle-shell feet were found at Priene ** and Sparta.'4 Another from Athens 5 rests on three Dionysus-heads. We might suppose that the bowl originally had three identical cockle-shells, but that one was lost or broken and replaced by an inferior copy (no. 4). This explanation would account for the lead in nos. 3 and 4, which would help to keep the bowl from upsetting. But there is no sign that any of the cockle-shells were in fact fastened to anything; moreover no. 3 was found in Pit A, no. 2 in Pit B, and no. 4 at the bottom of Pit C. Therefore if they were part of one bowl we must suppose that just before the house was abandoned they were broken off and tossed into the three pits.

Two thin strips of bronze, each about o-Io long, probably from the rim of a small bowl. The left piece in the photograph (FIG. 7, a) shows what appears to be the outside, the right, the inside: both are too distorted for the shape and dimensions of the bowl to be recoverable. There is a narrow ridge about o0o05 m. below the rim and parallel to it, beaten from the outside in. The holes visible in the photograph may have been rivet holes, and I am not even certain that these pieces are from a bowl. At all events they are too flimsy to have belonged to the same piece as the cockle-shells. 8. Iron mattock-head. Length 0.235. Diameter of socket for shaft o0o4.

Deep plates like our nos. I-to and bowls like our no. I I seem to be common in Late Hellenistic times.40 It is surprising to find the 'West Slope' style of decoration at so late a date 41 even in so debased a form. As for the bowls with relief decoration (nos. I8-21), Thompson has already shown 42 that bowls with long petals are among the latest Megarian bowls; even so, I can find no evidence that they continued to be made in the Roman Imperial period. Professor Robinson informs me 36 E.g. De Ridder, Bronzes Antiques du Louvre nos. o1024-1027. Babblon and Blanchet, Bronzes Antiques de la Bibliothique Nationale nos. 1239-1241. Richter op. cit. no. 605 (a bronze phiale mesomphalos fluted to resemble a shell, from Cyprus). 7 Wiegand and Schrader, op. cit. 389, fig. 50oi. 38 Ibid. 391. '9 Athenaeus I 57. For other references see Frazer's Pausanias, note to VII 25, 5. 40 Our plates are clearly of the same class of table-ware as Thompson's E 1-21. But a comparison of the sections with Thompson's fig. 116 shows that they are by no means exactly the same; our out-turned, slightly thickened lips with incised grooves on the inside are quite different from his E (heavy lip undercut on the inside) or E 9Ig and E 21, whose lips are hammer-headed in section. Waage's shape 17 (Antioch on the Orontes IV i 12 and pl. II) provides a closer parallel. Waage (op. cit. I5) says that shape 17 came in at the end of the Early Hellenistic period, but that ' the listing of shapes as Early Hellenistic does not of course imply that none of them lasted into the Late Hellenistic period '. Compare also Scranton, op. cit. 532 fig. 3c, Wiegand and Schrader, Priene 424 nos. 81, 82, also fig. 539 for bowls like our no. I , but rather larger. Bowls of similar shape were also found by Wace and Dickins in Sparta (op. cit., especially Table III on p. I64). Their fig. 8a comes from Tomb C III and may therefore be as late as the reign of Augustus or after, though the evidence from this tomb is not conclusive. 41 But Wace and Dickins found ' two skyphoi with white or red and incised patterns' in Tomb C III (op. cit. Table III and fig. io). 42 Op. cit. 456.</page><page sequence="15">168 J. K. ANDERSON that bowls like no. 21 have been found in the Athenian Agora; none is earlier than the sack of the city by Sulla. He believes them to be imports from Italy. I hesitate to try to date the red-glazed ware by comparing it with the superior, widely spread fabrics which it is presumably imitating; it seems to me that the local potter made no attempt whatsoever to keep abreast of the fashion. Since he did not use the Pergamene technique, he was not in direct touch with the makers of this pottery. I have already discussed the date of the lamps. The presence of a coin of the Roman Imperial period in the ruins is best accounted for, in my opinion, by supposing that the house, after being abandoned, was left to fall gradually into decay and was visited by treasure-seekers or inquisitive travellers about the end of the first century after Christ. It is even possible that it continued in use as a tool-shed and store for more than a century after it ceased to be inhabited as a dwelling: a farmer owning land in the coastal plain and on the hill-slopes near Mamousia would find a storehouse near his upper farm convenient. It seems quite certain, even if allowances are made for the conservatism of local potters, that none of the pottery (except the amphoras, which cannot be closely dated) can be as late as the end of the first century after Christ. As for the circumstances in which the house was abandoned, there was, as I have said already, no obvious sign of violence. And nothing was found which was not broken and useless; even the bronzes would have less value in the eyes of an ancient peasant than in those of a modern antiquary. I have therefore formed the opinion that the inhabitants left peaceably, taking with them most of their goods (for example, all the farm tools except one broken mattock: I find this a strong argument that the house was not looted; looters would probably have had no use for agricultural implements and left the lot). What was too bulky to move, like the pithoi, or too cheap to bother about, like the pottery, some of which may have been already broken, they left behind. Many other houses in Keryneia seem to have been given up at the same time, to judge by the surface pottery: the site is an inconvenient one in times of peace, though very strong. Perhaps in the Roman period people preferred to live nearer the coastal plain.43 Keryneia still existed in Pausanias's time,44 but I find it easier to understand his movements between Keryneia and Bura if we suppose that he did not go as far inland as the walled city near Mamousia. I would suggest that the ancient remains now known as the 'Helleniko', on the north edge of the Keryneia plateau, may be those of his sanctuary of the Eumenides. In the church of Mamousia are preserved the plinth, feet, and part of the drapery of a marble statue said to have been found here. The statue was a draped female figure, about half life size. Its style is archaistic, and it might quite possibly be one of the statues of priestesses which Pausanias saw.45 APPENDIX The Cake Stamp (no. 41) 46 The centre of the design, which is rather off the geometric centre, is a circular impression o0o3 m. in diameter, in the middle of which is a punch mark o*oI m. long: this has been modelled roughly to the shape of a human head, but no features are indicated. Radiating from the 4' After the War of Independence against the Turks many of the hill villages in the Peloponnese were partly abandoned, Ior example, Peristera near the Styx. 4 VII 25, 5 ff. 4 VII 25, 7. 46 The Rev. V. E. S. Kenna and Mr. R. V. Nicholls have examined a cast of this stamp and a pnotograpn ana maae many valuable suggestions about the nature of the objects depicted: the credit for making sense out of this stamp belongs to them, but if my interpretation of its religious significance is wide of the mark, the fault is entirely mine.</page><page sequence="16">EXCAVATIONS NEAR MAMOUSIA IN ACHAIA 169 upper part of this are twelve short incisions. Suspended from the lower edge of the circular impression is a square of side o-oI5 m., lightly stamped in the clay. To either side of this is a punch mark in the shape of an isosceles triangle, with sides of about three-quarters of a centimetre. The bases of these triangles are horizontal, and the inside lower angle of each touches the middle of one of the vertical sides of the square. Above their apices are small marks of doubtful significance. At the bottom are three small human figures lightly incised in the clay. All are standing. That on the left faces to the right and appears to be wearing a long trailing robe. It is passive. The other two figures seem to have their backs towards the observer (i.e. to face the central circle): the middle one raises both hands in an attitude of prayer; the right-hand one raises the right hand only, the left being extended at an angle of forty-five degrees downwards. There are traces of what may be another figure in the square below the central circle, but they are not at all clear. On either side of this central group a wide, deep incision extends from the bottom edge of the stamp to a point about level with the centre of the circle. These marks seem to be made with a pointed instrument: their tops taper and waver, and Mr. Kenna suggests that they are probably torches. To the left and right of these are figures or symbols which are presumably complementary to the main scene On the right is a short vertical mark, rectangular at the top. Above it, on a level with the head in the circle, is a circular punch mark rather over a centimetre in diameter with a slight groove round its edge. A similar punch mark occupies a corresponding position to the left of the main scene. To the left of it again, near the edge of the stamp, is what appears to be a draped and veiled female figure about four centimetres tall. None of her features can be distinguished, and it is uncertain therefore in which direction she is facing: one arm is raised towards the edge of the stamp. To her right is a symbol or implement shaped roughly like an obtuse angle, of which one arm extends to the right and slightly upward, the other downward and to the left. Above the upper arm are three short vertical marks. Below this instrument (i.e. below and to the right of the female figure) is a shallow rectangular impression, apparently stamped with the same stamp as the square below the central circle, though it is not itself a square, as its right edge is cut away by the left-hand torch. Within it are, to the left, a slight vertical mark, and to the right of this a small circular punch mark. Over all is a canopy consisting of two semicircles apparently punched with an instrument shaped like a tube split along its length and rather thickened at the rim: on either side of and below these are quadrants punched with the same implement: these are cut by the edge of the disc. The semicircles are separated from each other and from the quadrants by small circular punch marks. In the right-hand semicircle is a circular punch mark like those which flank the two torches: in the left is a hook or sickle-shaped symbol. At the very top is a wreath or branch, probably either of palm or olive. The stamp is not painted or glazed in any way: the discolorations visible in the photograph are incrustations. That the scene is religious there can be no doubt; the central feature clearly shows the adoration of a god by his worshippers. And I assume that this scene was stamped on sacred loaves or cakes for use on some ritual occasion."47 As I have already said, I can find no exact parallel. But there is a curious series of stamps, mostly from Taranto,48 upon which are impressed numbers of different and apparently unconnected symbols. These stamps resemble 4' The evidence that these clay stamps were used on sacred cakes is that they were clearly used for stamping some- thing; this something was perishable, or at all events has not survived, though the stamps have in large numbers, and there is plenty of literary evidence (a little of which is given below) for the use of cakes of various sorts at religious festivals. Of course not all the stamps are obviously religious in significance. 48 Sir Arthur Evans in JHS VII 44 if. first identified them as 'moulds for sacred cakes'. McDaniel (AJA XXVIII 24 ff.) gives a useful collection of illustrations, but calls them merchants' seals.</page><page sequence="17">170 J. K. ANDERSON ours and differ from the usual cake stamps in that the designs on them are made up of a large number of small separate stamps and were not impressed on the clay all at once from an original complete design. There, however, the resemblance ends; the objects (distaffs, crescents, amphoras, torches, birds, wheels, sheep, hands and so forth) stand in no very obvious relation to one another; they may have a mystical connection, but this has yet to be explained satisfactorily, and even those which are recognisable as attributes of gods suggest a bewildering number of deities.49 A further difference between these South Italian stamps and ours is that many of them have short, perforated handles on one side. But whatever they may be, I feel no doubt about the unity, purpose, and religious significance of our design. The identity of the god and the nature of the ceremony are not so certain. The radiate head in the centre might well be Apollo. At the altar of Apollo -To0 yEvTropoS in Delos the only offerings were wheat and barley and v6rrrava laid on the altar without fire.50 But it is hard to explain the other figures and objects as attributes of Apollo; moreover, it seems strange that a cake which was a sacrifice and nothing more should have a scene like this stamped on it. At the Diasia the Athenians sacrificed to Zeus Meilichios cakes moulded in the form of animals; 51 it seems inappropriate to offer to the god his own image and that of his worshippers. Possibly the bread marked with our stamp was used in some sort of com- munion ceremony belonging to one of the mystery religions. (There seems nothing to connect the design with the worship of the Eumenides, whose sanctuary is the only one mentioned by Pausanias at Keryneia.) The round impression under the right-hand arch of the canopy and the two similar impressions on either side of the tops of the torches may be meant for cymbals: this suggests the worship of Attis. The hooked object under the left-hand arch would then be the instrument of his self-mutilation and the figure on the left (whose superior size and position marks her off from the worshippers below) would be the Great Mother, the object in front of her being ' shorthand' for her chariot. However, her peaceful attitude hardly suits, iuncta iuga resolvens Cybele leonibus laevumque pecoris hostem stimulans. And the lions and chariot are not actually shown. Cook 52 illustrates a marble statue of Attis, dating from the time of Hadrian, whose head 'twined with a garland of pine-cones, almonds, pomegranates, poppy-heads and flowers, wears a Phrygian cap which is encircled below by five rays . . .'. But I do not know an Attis with a radiate head like the one on this stamp. Mr. R. V. Nicholls suggests that the two triangles on either side of the square below the central circle may symbolise the Dioskouroi. But I am unable to explain the rest of the design if this is so. I can see no trace of Bacchic symbolism. I myself think that the head in the centre may be Triptolemos. Triptolemos is often shown wreathed 53 or with corn-ears round his head ; 54 moreover, Prof. A. B. Cook 55 shows 49 For example, on the stamp published by Sir Arthur Evans (op. cit.) there are: a thunderbolt for Zeus, a trident for Poseidon, the torches of Persephone, the club of Herakles, the lyre of Apollo, a caduceus for Hermes, amphorae for the Dioskouroi, and a lot of unexplained symbols. This multiplicity of gods is one of the reasons which makes McDaniel regard these stamps as compound seals. 5o Diogenes Laertius VIII 13, quoting the Aikov rrorria of Aristotle; Iamblichus v.

The figure on the left is then Demeter with the plough (the object in front of her looks much more like a plough than a chariot); for Demeter with the plough compare the crater from Cumae.53 The two torches suggest Persephone, but Persephone herself is missing, unless she is the figure (if there is a figure) in the central square. She should, of course, be balancing her mother on the right of the composition. The part of the design to the right has been rather cramped, but I cannot find the figure of a goddess there, and one can hardly suppose that such an important person would be left out for want of space. Perhaps her torches were thought to be enough. The hooked object under the left arch of the canopy will be a sickle, which is appropriate enough, but I cannot account for the circular punch marks; they can hardly represent the wheel (or wheels) of Triptolemos's famous chariot. Triptolemos is not specially connected with Keryneia, but he visited Patras.56 J. K. ANDERSON 56 Pausanias VII 18, 2.</page><page sequence="19">B.S.A. XLVIII. PLATE 36. (c) MAMOUSIA.
