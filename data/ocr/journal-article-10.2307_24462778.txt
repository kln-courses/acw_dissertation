<plain_text><page sequence="1">One of Milton's main problems in writing Paradise Lost must have been that of describing beings, things and places which no man had ever seen. Leland Ryken, The Apocalyptic Vision in 43</page><page sequence="2">Paradise Lost (Ithaca, New York, and London: Cornell University Press, 1970; 239 pp.; short index; 72s attempts to show exactly how Milton described the unseen, the invisible, the transcendental, the ideal, or what he calls the apocalyptic. Milton's method of dealing with the apocalyptic is called his "apocalyptic vision." The foundations for Milton's apocalyptic vision Professor Ryken says, are rooted in the Christian doctrine of accommodation, the Platonic notion of Ideas and in the general theories of Christian human ism. Milton has several practical methods of compar ing things unseen with things seen. He describes the apocalyptic by contrast, negation, analogy, and by physical or temporal separation. Throughout, the apocalyptic is measured against the empirical. For instance, in one section, Ryken describes the many instances of what he calls "mystic oxymoron," in which two empirical phenomena, such as "liquid [and] Plain" (IV, 455), are juxtaposed to describe the undescribable or "to suggest a transcendental realm in which the sum is greater than the parts" (p. 91). Milton, Ryken says, should not be condemned for trying to describe Heaven, Hell, angels, demons, Paradise and God; instead "it would seem that he deserves that greater praise for having created a vi sionary world removed from daily experience but open to the imaginative vision of the reader of the poem" (p. 5). It is necessary, he says, to understand Milton's apocalyptic technique in order not to con demn him, as many critics have done, for attempting to describe the undescribable. Ryken makes many useful smaller points along the way as he supports his thesis. Milton, he writes "drew upon the tradition which pictures ideal per fection through enameled images" (p. 87); "the por trayal of God as a transcendent voice adheres to the principle of conceiving of the divine as 'the negation of personality'" (p. 105; the phrase is from Kenneth Burke); Milton has three major techniques in creating his apocalyptic imagery: "the frequent use of con ceptual imagery rather than sensory imagery, the use of generic terms rather than specific images, and, within the area of sensory imagery, frequent use of nonvisual images" (p. 190). Ryken's book is neat and orderly. Its thesis is plausible and his various points are perhaps too thoroughly documented. Ryken deals in abstractions, hence he has some understandable problems in defi nition (people are still arguing violently over the nature of "Christian humanism"), and his lists of various things, such as the anthropomorphic attrib utes of God, sometimes are too long for comfort. Overall, though, he provides a new perspective on Milton's methods of composition in Paradise Lost and he corrects a very old platitude of criticism: that Milton should never have dared to picture things unseen in an epic poem.</page></plain_text>
