The paradox is readily discernible, and presents no par- ticularly interesting problem to the historian of ideas. However, a recognition of its existence does have significance both for those who are interested in the methodology of psychology and for those who realize that a sound empirical psychology is an essential tool for philosophy. The paradox may be stated as follows: those contemporary psy- chologists who most strongly insist that there is an absolute continuity between animal and human behavior are also the psychologists who most frequently inveigh against "anthropomorphic" interpretations of ani- mal behavior. This, I submit, is a paradox, even if it is not a con- tradiction. It is paradoxical because it holds that we can under- stand human behavior in terms of animal behavior and yet that we can not understand animal behavior in terms which are familiar to us through our observation of human beings. As we shall later see, a tacit assumption accounts for the fact that this paradox is rarely challenged; as we shall also see, this assumption rests on a confusion. In order to illustrate this paradox let us choose an example which will at the same time serve to reveal one of its implications. Let us assume that a philosopher-or any other "'plain man "-were to say in speaking of a dog, "its shame was comical." Most psychologists would immediately charge us with " anthropomorphism." Yet these same psychologists would object most violently if we were to set up the thesis that some of the basic factors in human behavior would forever remain secrets to those who study only animal behavior. This paradox might, of course, be said to be apparent and not real, since the term "basic factors in human behavior" is vague. Our psychologist might, for example, argue that "shame" is "so- cially conditioned" in man, and can not therefore characterize a dog's behavior: the dog behaves much as we do when we experience shame, and we are "anthropomorphic " enough in our language and thought to attribute "shame" to it. Yet this answer does not escape the paradox. For what is generally called "social condi- tioning" does not actually account for human shame. A man evidences shame only under certain circumstances, e.g., when he feels that he has acted wrongly or stupidly. "Social conditioning" can (at best) account only for the fact that the individual has been "conditioned" to believe that certain acts are wrong or stupid; it can not account for the shame which he feels when he realizes that</page><page sequence="2">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 247 the act is of this nature. Thus, the doctrine of "social conditioning" might account for when an individual feels shame; it would not ac- count for the fact that he feels shame.' This being the case, any one who insists on the continuity between animal and human behavior should be willing to speak of "shame" in a dog, rather than dis- missing such examples as being instances of "anthropomorphism." Thus, the paradox remains. Of course, no one would argue that all of the characteristics of human "shame" are necessarily also present in cases of "shame" among animals. In this as in other respects there are doubtless significant differences between the experiences of human beings and of other animals. To attribute to all animals exactly the same perceptual discriminations, motivation, or learning which we find among men would be unwarranted anthropomorphism. But where we find behavioral evidence that animals do discriminate, act and learn in much the same fashion as do men, we have every right to try to understand their behavior by means of an analysis which starts from human experience. As long as we believe that there is a significant continuity between animal and human behavior, we have as much right to approach animal behavior through what we can discover about human behavior as to proceed in the opposite direction.2 This is not anthropomorphism. The customary rejoinder to this contention is that science must always proceed from that which is simpler to that which is more complex. This, however, is a radically mistaken view of the ideal of simplicity in empirical science. This ideal demands: first, that an adequate theory should be simple, i.e., not encumbered with sub- sidiary, underived hypotheses; and, second, that verification should proceed through the use of relatively simple materials in order to 1 In order to account for the latter fact, the doctrine of "social conditioning" would have to establish a view roughly similar to the following: children are punished for performing certain acts; they not only become "conditioned" against these acts, they also become "conditioned" to expect punishment for performing them; when, for any reason, they later perform an act which they have been (in some way) "conditioned" to shun, they expect punishment, and shrink from it, attempting to escape; when escape is impossible they feel an emotion; this emotion, aroused by a "conditioned" fear of punishment, is shame. In addition to the vagueness of the concept of "conditioning," this type of account would be suspect for two reasons: (1) phenomenologically, many (and perhaps all) cases of shame seem to have a direct connection with one's ego, not with a fear of punishment; (2) many forms of effective " conditioning" (even early in a child's life) are themselves based upon the phenomenon of shame. 2 1 see no reason to suppose that the theory of biological evolution demands a "one-way" interpretation. It would appear to be as plausible to hold that rudi- mentary characteristics may themselves undergo modification and development, as that evolution has proceeded by a mere compounding of elementary, unchang- ing characteristics.</page><page sequence="3">248 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY guard against the introduction of extraneous, complicating factors in our experiments. The ideal of simplicity in empirical science is, thus, an ideal of simplicity in theory, and of simplicity in experiment. It is not a necessary part of this ideal that we should examine com- plex phenomena only in the light of those apparently simple cases in which these phenomena are exemplified in rudimentary form. Furthermore, I should like to suggest that there are certain prac- tical dangers inherent in the attempt to proceed from the more " simple" to the more complex. In the first place, by confining our attention to the "simpler instances " we may be excluding from our data those cases in which the basic principles are most manifest; it is by no means sure that "simple" cases are those in which it is simple to see the full nature of the process with which we are concerned. In fact, hypotheses are sometimes more likely to be suggested by the observation of instances which are not themselves simple, for in them the variety of factors which is present suggests alternative hypotheses which can be narrowed down by a comparison of in- stances, and by experiment. Simple data, by virtue of their sim- plicity, often fail to provide us with a sufficiently large number of clues. In the second place, there is a danger that in first considering simple cases we shall have to heap hypothesis upon hypothesis in order to account for the more complex instances which are related to them. Finally, in the attempt to confine his attention to animal behavior the psychologist is arbitrarily cutting himself off from ac- cess to important materials, since we are presumably in a better position to understand our own behavior than we are to understand the behavior of other animals, e.g., the behavior of a rat in a maze.3 When we take into account these practical considerations of method, and when we realize that the ideal of simplicity in science does not demand that our investigations start from apparently "simple" materials, there is, I submit, no methodological reason for psychology to frame its concepts solely in terms of animal be- havior. I am well aware of the difficulties which are sometimes involved in starting our investigations from experimentation with human subjects. But this is a different matter. What I am con- cerned to point out is the fact that concepts whose meaning is clear in the field of human experience may often be legitimately used in understanding animal behavior. This is not anthropomorphism, and it ill befits any one who wishes to insist on the essential con- tinuity between animal and human behavior to charge that it is. MAURICE MANDELBAUM SWARTHMORE COLLEGE 8 I assume (I hope not without warrant) that when a psychologist deals with a rat in a maze, he is interested in understanding why the rat behaves as it does, and is not merely concerned with the score which it makes.</page></plain_text>
