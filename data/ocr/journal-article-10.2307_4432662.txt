<plain_text><page sequence="1">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS TEXT, TRANSLATION AND COMMENTS ON DEPLACmS 1.7.1-10 BY DAVID T. RUNIA 1. Introduction*) There was, as we all know, a very long tradition of criticism of religion and religious traditions by philosophers in the ancient world, beginning with Xenophanes, and continuing in various shapes and forms until the very end of antiquity. It can be safely said that this criticism reached its apogee fairly early on, from about 450 to 380 BCE, in the period which Guthrie has entitled the 'Greek Enlightenment'. This is the period in which most of the so- called Greek 'atheists' such as Diagoras of Melos, Prodicus and Critias lived (we may also include Protagoras, although he is clear- ly an agnostic rather than an atheist; Theodore of Cyrene and Euhemerus are later). According to Marek Winiarczyck, the schol- ar who during the last twenty years has placed the study of ancient atheism on an entirely new footing, none of these figures actually were atheists, but other anonymous thinkers who do deserve this description were active at this time1). It is no coincidence that this period also covers the years of Plato's youth. Plato was the philoso- pher who did more than anyone else to ensure that this atheistic movement never obtained a secure place in ancient culture2). My intention in this paper is to focus attention on a small *) Thanks to my colleagues A. P. Bos and J. Mansfeld who made helpful com- ments on a draft version of this paper, and to Drs.

I will concentrate on a text in the doxographer A?tius, in which a number of these atheists are mentioned. Through this text we learn not all that much about these thinkers themselves, but we do learn a lot about the intellectual and literary contexts in which reference was made to them. On the surface this text does not seem particularly problematic. A closer look, however, reveals numerous difficulties, relating to (1) the philosophical doctrines described, (2) the argument that the author wishes to present, and (3) the sources drawn upon for his materiati. The body of scholarly literature on this text is not extensive, and has been almost exclusively preoccupied with the third question of the text's sources3). No attempt has been made to examine what the author himself is trying to achieve with- in his own doxographical context. But first a few words are required about the author. Who was this totally obscure reporter of philosophical opinions? It is only through chance that we happen to know his name4). Under the name of Plutarch a work in 5 short books has been preserved en- titled ?e?? t?? ??es???t?? f???s?f??? f?s???? d????t?? (On the physical doctrines opined by the phibsophers). Our text is derived from this work. This work is certainly not by Plutarch himself. It is dated to the 2nd century, and was already extensively used by Eusebius in the early 4th century. Various passages from this work are also found in the huge Anthology of Johannes Stobaeus (c. 400). But there they appear in a different, often much fuller form. Unfortunately Stobaeus does not tell us where he obtained this material from. It so happens, however, that a few years later Theodoret, bishop of Cyrrhus, also excerpted a small amount of material parallel to Stobaeus, but not derived from Ps.Plutarch. By a stroke of fortune Theodoret happens to refer to its author by the name of A?tius, and also gives us the title of the work S??a???? pe?? ??es???t?? (Com- pendium on the opinions [of the phibsophers])5). Apart from this casual ref- 3) Main discussions of the whole passage (and not just details) in Diels (1879), 58-59, Philippson (1939), 16-27 (but only for parallels with Cicero), Winiarzyck (1976), 4245, and the notes in the new French translation of Lachenaud (on which see text below to n. 10). 4) The following sketch is very general and somewhat imprecise. For a more exact summary see Runia (1989), 248-250. More on A?tius in Dorandi (1989). 5) Theodoret, Curatio affect, graec. 4.31.</page><page sequence="3">544 DAVID T. RUMA erence we have no evidence about the author whatsoever, except what we can deduce from the work itself. On the basis of this evi- dence he is usually dated to about 50-100 CE. The first scholar to identify A?tius and make a successful attempt to reconstruct his work was Herman Diels in his celebrated Doxographi Graed6). It was Diels who coined the term 'doxographer'. In his collection A?tius is given pride of place. Today this obscure figure remains the chief extant representative of the so-called doxographical method of reporting the views of ancient philosophers. The passage of A?tius that we will be examining in this article is located in Book I, chapter 7. Diels' reconstruction of the chapter is almost certainly accurate. Our passage represents approximately the first half of the chapter, and is found only in Ps.Plutarch (880D-881D). Of the remaining part of the chapter an epitome is found in Ps.Plutarch (881D-882A), but what looks like a complete text is taken up by Stobaeus in his chapter on God (1.1.29b). The first part of the chapter was very likely also present in his Anthobgy, but was removed by Byzantine epitomators (who were not interest- ed in atheistic views)7). Other versions of our text in Eusebius, Theodoret and Ps.Galen are wholly derivative, having been excerpt- ed from Ps.Plutarch (and not A?tius himself)8). Because we have only Ps.Plutarch's version, we cannot be certain that he copied out the original text in A?tius verbatim. He is an epitomator, so it is not impossible that he has left out (or modified) parts of the more copi- ous original. In this situation we are reduced to surmisal9). The text of our passage furnishes no problems. I have used the 6) Diels (1879). 7) As proven by Diels (1881), 348 against the criticism of Elter (1880). 8) See Eusebius Praep. Evang. 14.16.1-5, Theodoret, Curatio affect, graec. 2.112, 3.4, Ps. Galen, Historia Philosopha 35 (text in Diels (1879), 617-618). There is also an important Arabic translation of Ps.Plutarch, exhaustively studied by Daiber (1980). 9) See further the discussion at Mansfeld-Runia (1996), chap. 3, where we examine Ps.Plutarch's method of excerpting at some length, and conclude that on the whole he abbreviates by leaving out complete doxai, rather than by compressing individual doxai. This may give us some confidence that we have the text in a reasonably integral state. But there are exceptions, so we cannot be wholly sure... It is interesting to compare what Ps.Galen (see previous note) does with Ps.Plutarch, for he is making an epitome of an epitome. He reduces our passage to 8 lines, using the method of (considerable) compression.</page><page sequence="4">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 545 most recent critical edition published very recently by G. Lachenaud in the Bude series, but it agrees to the letter with the previous critical text of J. Mau in the Teubner series10). The sub- division of the text into paragraphs by Diels?dropped by both modern editors?has been retained for practical reasons. The trans- lation given is the first to be made into English11). The commentary that follows the text and translation does not aim at exhaustiveness, but rather seeks to guide the reader along in his or her reading of this difficult text (this applies also to the selec- tion of bibliographical material). Its chief points of focus are the fol- lowing: (i) what is the literary and philosophical background and prove- nance of the material used? are there parallel texts which shed light on this background? (ii) how does the passage and its contents relate to the doxo- graphical method used by A?tius and other doxographical texts? (iii) what is the argument that A?tius is presenting to his reader? can it be said to amount to a coherent whole? The formulation of the second 'point of focus' may seem a bit curi- ous. I say 'relate to' and not 'exemplify' deliberately, because a quick comparison with the remainder of A?tius' work shows that our pas- sage is clearly exceptional. Instead of just presenting views of philosophers (d??a?), it also gives arguments. In order to reach a fuller understanding of our passage it will be necessary firstly to place it within the two chapters on theology (1.6 and 1.7), and sec- ondly within A?tius' work as a whole. It cannot be the aim of this paper to achieve this task, but I do hope to return to the subject in a subsequent study. 10) Lachenaud (1993), Mau (1971); the latter edition replaced that of Diels (1879), which is still often cited. 11) Other translations into modern languages in Torraca (1961), 46-51 (based on Diels), Lachenaud (1993), 84-87.</page><page sequence="5">546 DAVID T.

Translation 1.7 Who is the deity? ?1 Some of the philosophers, such as Diagoras of Melos and Theodore of Cyrene and Euhemerus of Tegea, say that the gods do not exist at all. Euhemerus is also hinted at by Callimachus of Cyrene when he writes in his Iambi: Come hither to the temple in front of the wall, where the old man who fabricated the ancient Panchaean Zan scribbles his unrighteous books like the charlatan he is. These books are the ones on the subject that the gods do not exist. ?2 Euripides the tragic poet did not wish to disclose this view for fear of the Areopagus, but did make his position known in the fol- lowing way. He introduced the character of Sisyphus as defender of this opinion, and so pleaded his cause by means of this man's judg- ment: For there was a time, he says, when human life was disordered, beast-like, and at the mercy of violence. Then, he says, the lawlessness was dissolved through the introduc- tion of laws. Since, however, the law was able to curb overt acts of injustice but many people continued to practise them in secret, at that point a wise man ordained that it was necessary 'to blind the truth with a false account' and persuade mankind: how there is a deity flourishing with imperishable life, who hears and sees and takes good note of such deeds. ?3 Let such poetic nonsense be done away with, he says, together with the words of Callimachus: if you recognize God, be aware that for the deity it is possible to achieve everything. For not even God can do everything. If God indeed exists, let him then make snow black, fire cold, what is sedentary upright and vice versa. ?4 And when the grandiloquent Plato says that 'God formed the cosmos by looking at himself as model', he reeks of archaic moon- struck nonsense, to use the language of the ancient comic poets. For how did he create while looking to himself? And how can he [Plato] say the deity is spherical in shape, humbler in status than man?</page><page sequence="8">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 549 ?5 Anaxagoras says that at the beginning the bodies were at rest, but the mind of God gave them an orderly arrangement, and brought about the births of all things. ?6 Plato on the other hand supposed that the primary bodies were not at rest, but moving in a disorderly fashion. Therefore, he says, God, ordaining that order is better than disorder, gave them an orderly arrangement. ?7 Both thinkers therefore have this mistake in common, namely that they made God to be concerned with human affairs or even to create the cosmos on this account. For the blessed and indestruc- tible living being, who is entirely replete with every kind of good thing and not receptive to any evil, being wholly focused on the maintenance of his felicity and indestructibility, is not involved with human concerns, for otherwise he would be wretched in the man- ner of a workman and a builder, burdened with care and fretting about the construction of the cosmos. ?8 Another argument is that the god of whom they speak either (i) did not exist in the previous age when the bodies were either at rest or in disorderly movement, or (ii) he was asleep or (iii) he was awake, or (iv) neither of these. The first option (i) is unacceptable, for God is eternal. The second (ii) too is unacceptable. If God was sleeping from eternity, he would be dead, since eternal sleep is (tan- tamount to) death. But God is also not receptive to sleep, for God's immortality and a state close to death are separated by a great dis- tance. ?9 If, however, God was awake (iii), either (a') there was a defi- ciency in his felicity or (?') he was wholly fulfilled in his blessedness. But neither according to the first option is he blessed, because a deficiency in felicity is incompatible with blessedness, nor according to the second option, because then, though in no way deficient in happiness, he would embark on deeds that were to no purpose. ?10 How does it happen then, if God indeed does exist and human affairs are administered through his forethought, that what is fraud- ulent flourishes and what is noble suffers the opposite fate? Agamemnon, for example, was: both an excellent king and a mighty warrior, but he was overpowered and murdered by an adulterer and an</page><page sequence="9">550 DAVID T. RUNIA adulteress. And this man's relative Heracles, after he had cleaned up many of the evils that infest human life, fell prey to the sorcery of Deianira and was murdered. References: ?1 Diagoras fr.

Commentary Titk. The theme of the chapter follows on directly from the subject of the previous chapter, 1.6 'From where did men obtain a conception of the gods (?????a ?e??)?'. The first part of A?tius' work is distinctly untidy. Important for our chapter is the fact that he begins by emphasizing that his subject is physics or natural philosophy (pro?mium). He then discusses what f?s?? is (1.1). The following major theme is the principles of physics (1.3 ?e?? t?? ????? t? e?s??). This sets the stage for the whole of book I which deals with principles in the broader sense. After a cosmological interlude (1.4?5), he commences to discuss specific principles, i.e. God (1.6-7, with a chapter on daimones and heroes appended, 1.8), matter (1.9) and idea (1.10). These are of course the classic three Middle Platonist prin- ciples (already set out under Plato's name in 1.3, cf. Alcinous DidaskalUcos 8-12, and see Lachenaud (1993), 25). ??? ? ?e??; The chapter's title is unusual. The vast majority of A?tius' chapters have a title On x\ Cf. Ps.Galen Hist. Phil. 35 ?e?? ?e?? (same title at Sextus Empiricus Pynh. Hyp. 3.2, cf. Adv. Phys. 1.13 ?e?? ?e??). But cf. 1.1 t? ?st? f?s??. In the title of 1.3 (cited above) we see a mixture of the two forms. On the form of the question raised see further the com- ment on ?1. The use of the article is surely deliberate, i.e. the god identi- fied as principle, and I have translated accordingly. ?1. A?tius begins his chapter on theology by listing a number of philo- sophers who deny the existence of the gods (plural). ????? t?? f???s?f??... The listing of these three thinkers as atheists is by this time wholly traditional. The same three names recur, for example, in Cicero NO 1.118-119 (plus Protagoras and Prodicus) and</page><page sequence="10">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 551 Sextus Empiricus Adv. Phys. 1.50-58 (plus these and Critias and Epicurus (!)). Such a traditional listing has received the scholarly label Atheistenkatabg. In his article on the subject (1976) Winiarczyk argues that this list was first brought into prominence by the Academic sceptic Clitomachus. He in turn drew on Epicurus, who had described Prodicus, Diagoras and Critias as raving lunatics (reported by Philodemus, cf. Pap. Here. 1077, col. 82, cited as fr. 87 Usener, fr. 25.2 Arrighetti). See further the stemma given by Winiarczyk (1976), 45. He argues that A?tius relates to Clitomachus via an Epicurean intermediary. This is based on the theory of Diels that the whole of our passage is taken by A?tius from an Epicurean source (to which we shall return below in ?3). For further literature on the Atheistenkatabg see Winiarczyk (1989), 185-186. Of the atheists mentioned Diagoras is to be dated to the 2nd half of the 5th century, while Theodore and Euhemeros were contemporaries of Epicurus (between 350 and 250), and for this reason are not mentioned in his list. Winiarczyk has made editions of the testimonia and fragments of all three; see (1981), (1991). On the evidence on their atheism see further his (1984) article entitled Wer galt im Altertum ah Atheist?. We note that Diagoras is also mentioned by Philodemus himself in De pietate, cf. Schober (1988), 122 col. XI ? 7, and that his view and that of Protagoras are clear- ly referred to in a brief report of views on the gods at col. XV ? 1-5 (p. 125 Schober). These texts are not referred to in Winiarczyck (1976), (1981). Two centuries later the Epicurean Diogenes of Oenoanda refers to the same theme in a fragment of his Inscription, fr. 16 Smith (the views of Diagoras and Protagoras). Reference to atheists is thus standard in Epicurean literature, though they are not found in Lucretius. fas?... Note the use of the present tense. As we shall note below in our discussion of ?3, for the doxographer it is the doxa or opinion that counts. He is collecting views on a particular subject. The historical location of the philosophers' names is of secondary importance, and it is therefore natural to use the present tense. ?? e??a? ?e???. Why does A?tius, when his subject is theology, begin by discussing the views of those who deny the existence of God or gods? Two complementary answers can be given. (1) Mansfeld has shown in two comprehensive articles that the method of the piacila used by A?tius can be traced back to the use of dialectical method of argumentation by Aristotle and his school; see (1990), esp. 3193-3206, (1992a). Aristode set out this method in his Topics, and put it into practice in his writings. When dealing with physical and ethical prob- lems one should examine the views of previous thinkers, the so-called ??d??a. These 'reputable opinions' can be examined under various head-</page><page sequence="11">552 DAVID T. RUMA ings. Later these topics become standard and are usually asked in the order corresponding to the categories (existence, quantity, quality, location etc.). The two main questions relevant for our text are in fact posed by Aristotle at Anal. Post. ? 1, 89b31-35: e??a d' ????? t??p?? ??t???e?, ???? e? est?? ? ?? est? ???ta???? ? ?e?? (t? d* e? est?? ? ?? ap??? ????, a??* ??? e? ?e???? ? ??), ????te? d? ?t? est?, t? ?st? ??t???e?, ???? t? ??? ?st?? ?e?? ? t? ?st?? ?????p??. Here we see with perfect clarity the questions 'whether it exists' (e? est??) and 'what it is' (t? ?st??). In both cases Aristotle uses the subject of God as an example. First the question must be answered whether God exists; then the subject of his nature or sub- stance follows. Grosso modo these two questions correspond to the two main parts of A?tius 1.7 (the qualification is required because there seems a shift from 'what is', i.e. the essence, to 'who is', i.e. the identification of the nature, but this aspect is not relevant to our passage). See further Mansfeld (1991), 3205, (1992a), 92. It is in fact possible to strengthen this argument with more texts which point in the same direction. Mansfeld points out that at 1.24 A?tius begins his chapter on genesis and destruction with those Eleatic thinkers who deny that such changes exist. It might be added that Aristotle himself explicitly raises the question of the existence of genesis in a dialectical discussion at De Caeb 3.1, 298b 12. Futhermore there is a source parallel to A?tius, Achilles, which in a chapter on the moon states that some thinkers affirm that the moon does not exist at all (?21, 49.2 Maass). This cryptic remark only makes sense in the light of Aristotle's use of the moon at Anal Post. ? 2, 90a3~5 as an example of an entity of which is it possible to ask whether it exists or not. Commentators must have assumed that in that text some doubt was cast on the moon's existence. Another similar text may be noted at Cic. Acad. 2.124, where Dicaearchus is cited as denying the existence of the mind. (2) The statement that some thinkers deny the existence of gods also implies a dialectical technique that is virtually omnipresent in A?tius' work, namely the diaeresis, or the practice of organizing views into contrasting pairs or related groups. The former category can be called a diagreement (d?af???a, dissensio) or a diaeresis in the form of an exclusive disjunction. The latter category is a non-exclusive division (d?a??es??, divisio). The technique goes back to Plato and even earlier (cf. the gigantomachia between the materialists and the idealists in Sophist 245-248, and the celebrated contrast between Parmenidean immobility and Heraclitean flux at Theaetetus 179-181; Mansfeld (1986) argues that it originates with the sophist Hippias). It is further developed by Aristotle and his school, but receives perhaps its most important impulse through the extensive usage by the New Academy in order to indicate the disagreement (d?af???a)</page><page sequence="12">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 553 that should lead us to withhold assent (ep???). Mansfeld has collected numerous parallels in philosophical literature anterior to and contempo- rary with A?tius: see his articles (1988a), (1988b), (1989). Most of the 133 chapters in the Compendium de pbcitis are organized by means of this tech- nique (for detailed examples see Runia (1989), Mansfeld (1990), 3092 ff.). For the basic diaeresis in the area of theology we may cite the begin- ning of Cicero's De natura deorum (1.2): velut in hac quaestione plerique, quod maxime veri simile est et quo omnes sese duce natura venimus, d?os esse dixerunt, dubitare se Protagoras, nullos esse omnino Diagoras Melius et Theodorus Cyrenaicus putaverunt. qui vero deos esse dixerunt tanta sunt in varietate et dissensione, ut eorum infini turn sit enumerare senten- tias... quod vero maxime rem causamque continet, utrum nihil agant nihil moliantur omni curatione et administratione rerum vacent, an contra ab fis et a principio omnia facta et constitu?a sint et ad infinitum tempus regantur atque moveantur, in primis magna dissensio est. The basic diaeresis is clear (note that to the first dichotomy on the gods' existence the position of agnosticism is added) gods do not exist uncertain do exist divine inactivity no providence creation providence The basic schema goes back to Plato's diatribe against atheists in Laws X 885b. Further examples at Aelian Varia Historia 2.31, Epictetus 1.12.1, Theodoret Cur. Affi Graec. 6.6-7 etc. It is clear that A?tius' opening words imply the basic dichotomy of the first division. The same dichotomy is found in a sceptical version at the beginning of Sextus' discussion on e? e?s? ?e?? at Adv. Phys. 1.50, in which, as we saw above, he proceeds to list seven atheists. On this diaeresis see also further below on ?7. ?a????a??? ? ?????a??? a???tteta?. The quoted lines are taken from the Iambi of Callimachus, fr. 191 Pfeiffer. These poems are no longer extant in a ms. tradition, but numerous papyrus fragments have been found, including one containing these lines (= P. Oxy. 1011). The third line describing Euhemerus is also found in the catalogue of atheists at Sext. Emp. Adv. Phys. 1.51. Since the line is found nowhere else except in these</page><page sequence="13">554 DAVID T. RUNIA two texts, this cannot be a coincidence. A common source must be involved. The word a???tteta? indicates that the poet did not mention Euhemerus by name. The discrepancies in the text between A?tius, Sextus and the papyrus do not concern us here; see the discussion in Pfeiffer ad be, and further discussion in Rees (1961). e?? t? p?? te??e?? ?e???. The precise nature of the reference to Euhemerus here has been the subject of controversy. The temple referred to is the Serapeum built by Parmeniscus (not the famous temple of the same name in Rhakotis). It has been attractively suggested that a statue of him in the pose of writing a book had been erected in front of the tem- ple. But it is also possible that he lived and worked in the neighbourhood. See further Rees (1961), Fraser (1972), 1.289-295, 2.453. t?? p??a? ?a??a??? ? p??sa? ???a. Euhemerus' romance entitled '?e?? a?a??af? described how he visited the distant (utopian) island of Panchaia, where he heard from the priests the account of how Zeus brought its inhabitants there from Crete while he was still a king on earth (hence the Cretan name for Zeus in our text). Euhemerus' particular brand of atheism argues that the gods of the Pantheon are deified famous men from the past. Copious further bibliography on Euhemerus and the Callimachean quote at Lachenaud (1993), 219-220. For the argument the reference to Zeus is significant. The atheists do not of course deny that men have a conception of the gods (see A?tius' previous chapter 1.6), but that there is anything that corresponds to that conception. What that conception is is further elucidated in the following paragraph ?2. ?2. The list of atheist views is complemented by the view of Euripides. His opinion is covertly expressed, but adds an interesting new aspect to the dis- cussion. ????p?d??. Although the tragic poet is on a few occasions described as an atheist in ancient sources (cf. Winiarczyk (1984), 171-172), he does not occur in the catalogues of atheists outside the A?tian tradition. Moreover in the parallel text in Sextus (Adv. Phys. 1.54) these views are attributed to Critias of Athens (one of the notorious thirty tyrants of 404 BCE, cousin of Plato's mother and one of the speakers in the Timaeus). Sextus quotes no less than 42 lines of poetry, among which are found the 6 lines of text which A?tius quotes (lines 1-2 and 17-18 cited in this chapter, lines 33-34 cited in 1.6), but he does not indicate that the speaker was Sisyphus (also the name of the play). In 1977 Dihle argued that A?tius was right and that Euripides was its author. This view has found some followers, but Wini- arczyk (1987) argues persuasively that the traditional attribution to Critias must be correct.</page><page sequence="14">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 555 ded?????t??

Phys. 1.56), as confirmed by the quote from the Silbi of Timon (1.57; cf. also Cic. ND 1.63). So it is likely that this detail was ulti- mately derived from the Atheisterdcatalog. In Satyrus' biography of Euripides it is recounted that he was accused of impiety by the demagogue Cleon but escaped conviction (Pap.

We may conclude that A?tius was acquainted with the entire poetic quote such as we find it in Sextus. His selectivity is noteworthy: the themes of the fear of the gods, and their dwelling-place in heaven are ignored, because they are not relevant to the question of their existence. On the suitability of the last quote for his argument see the following comment. ?3. So far A?tius has stated the atheistic position, and introduced an exam- ple of it in the form of Euripides' covert views. He now goes on to attack certain theological views.</page><page sequence="15">556 DAVID T. RUMA ? p???t???? ?????. What does this refer to? So far we have had three poetic quotes, and Euripides has been introduced as a t?a?fd?p????. In my view the acerbic term ????? refers primarily to the last quote. It is important to observe how suitable its two lines are for any kind of anti- theistic argument, for they assert (i) that God exists (est?), (ii) that he is a flourishing immortal being (implying no doubt ?a?a???t?? or e?da?- ????a), and (iii) that he observes what takes place in the cosmos, i.e. divine providence. Though placed in the mouth of an atheist (Sisyphus), they in fact contain all the theses that an atheist (or a sceptic) would wish to demolish. The word ????? is a strong pejorative term indicating a polemical stance. The word is repeated in the case of Plato in ?4 (see below). For Diels and Philippson the sharpness of the tone is an indication of the Epicurean background. Very similar is the scathing aggressive tone of the Epicurean Velleius as Cicero presents him in ND 1.18-56 (cf. ?\8 futtilis sententias (of Platonists), ?24 tarditatem (of Stoics), ?37 delirans (of Cleanthes)). We note too that at ?42 Velleius attacks poetic representations of the gods after he has dispensed with the philosophers' views (i.e. the reverse order compared with A?tius): exposuifere non phibsophorum indicia sed delirantium som- nia. nee enim multo absurdiora sunt ea quae poetarum vocibus fusa ipsa suavitate nocuerunt. But the false account of the gods in the poets attacked by Velleius, i.e. their anthropomorphic character and their immorality, is quite different from the object of A?tius' polemic. As a term of abuse and derision ????? is often employed in ancient comedy (see further on ?4). In philosophical polemic it does not become common until the beginning of our era. One example seems to occur at Epicurus fr. 24.21 Arrighetti, but one cannot be sure that the context is polemical. It is a favourite term of the aggressive Galen (about 40 exx.). In the deliberately equanimous Sextus Empiricus, however, it is found only once (Adv. Math. 1.141). Origen quotes Celsus as saying that the opinions of Moses on the nature of the world and mankind are nothing but ????? (C CeL?. 6.50). The term passes into the polemical stock-in-trade of Christian apologetics, directed at idol-worshippers, pagans and heretics (also taken over by the emperor Julian). Epiphanius Adv. Haer. (Panarion) 3.507.12 Holl affirms that Theodorus the Atheist said that bgoi about the gods were ?????. If this expression comes from Epiphanius' source, as seems likely, then it is an excellent parallel for our text. Cf. also Hermias, Irrisio 12, where Leucippus regards the theological archai of Pherecydes as ?????. The satirical, even derisive tone of this last work is intriguing. It is certainly not of Epicurean origin. The view of Kindstrand (1980) that the core of the work is a cynic or (more likely in our view) sceptic product,</page><page sequence="16">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 557 and that the Christian elements are peripheral, is too radical (see now Hanson (1993), 64?67), but the possibility of a certain affinity with sceptic works (as I prefer) should not be excluded. For texts specifically connecting ????? with poetry and poets, cf. Xenarchus Comicus ap. Athen. Deipn. 6.225c; Luc?an, Timon 1; Ps. Luc?an, Phibpatris 10; Aristides, ?e?? t?? pa?af????at?? 386.29; Ps. Justin, Or. ad Graecos 2.2; Eusebius, Praep. Ev. 3.15.1. The sentiment is found at Arist. Met. 1.2, 983a3, as noted by Pease ad C?e. ND 1.42. On the relation between poetry and theology see also Sext. Emp. at Adv. Phys. 1.60-74, who presents the first argument for the existence of the divine as the argument from the common agreement of all mankind (????? ?????a), and cites as evidence the views of the cleverest and most gifted of men, i.e. the poets and the natural philosophers (?63-64, counter-arguments at ?66-70, in which quotes from Homer are shown to be internally con- tradictory). f?s??. This word is at first sight very problematic, since it is not im- mediately clear to whom it refers. Diels (1879), 59 argued that this was evi- dence that A?tius had taken his extracts from an Epicurean anthology ver- batim. Philippson (1939), 21 adds: "Das f?s?? zeigt, da? wir hier eine w?rtliche Wiedergabe der Vorlage haben, das ???, da? das Vorige wenig- stens inhaltlich aus ihr stammt". Lachenaud (1993), 220 argues that f?s?? cannot refer to Critias (!) and aligns himself with the view of Diels. This view is only plausible, however, if two assumptions are acceptable: (a) that the view here is indeed what an Epicurean source would affirm; (b) that A?tius would be careless enough to take over a parenthetic 'he says' when it patently does not fit in his argument. With regard to the latter, twice in our passage we find a similar parenthetic f?s? (?2 Sisyphus, ?6 Plato), referring to the purveyor of the doxa described. But who is its subject here? It is possible, of course, that there is a lacuna in the text between ?2 and ?3. There is, however, another way of resolving this crux. We should take into consideration a fundamental characteristic of A?tius' doxo- graphical method, namely the fact that the doxographer is primarily inter- ested in the views he presents, which are juxtaposed against each other by means of antithesis and diaeresis. The names of the philosophers who rep- resent these views are of secondary importance (and often mistakes are made in assigning these names, as here in the case of Euripides). On the relation between doxai and name-labels see further Runia (1989), 269, Mansfeld (1990), 3058, (1992a), 65. The subject of f?s?? could, pace Lachenaud, be taken to be Sisyphus, but naturally only in the doxo- graphic, not the historical sense, i.e. as representative of the atheist opin- ion being presented in this section. The word 'for' (???) at the beginning</page><page sequence="17">558 DAVID T. RUNIA of ?3 thus connects up with the 'false account' of the gods embodied in the quote at the end of ?2. This is 'poetic nonsense'. The above argument would be strengthened if we took p???t???? in the sense of 'creative, inventive, fictional', but given the fact that it follows straight on a quote, and is followed by another piece of poetry, this interpretation is not so like- ly. On assumption (b), that the argument is Epicurean, see the comment below. s?? ?a??????f tf ?????t?. These lines have survived only in this text (= fr. 586 Pfeiffer, in the section Fragmenta incertae sedis), and thus are missing in Sextus Empiricus. But the fact that Callimachus is twice cited suggests that the poetic quote came from the same original source (i.e. the Atheistenkatabg^). e? ?e?? ??s?a. The Greek can be interpreted in two ways: 'if you admit that God exists', or 'if you know who or what God is'. Given the context we should opt for the former. As Pfeiffer ad be. notes, in the latter case we should expect oioO'fyou know too') instead of ?s?' ('know, be aware') in the next line. The emendation was proposed by Meineke, but is unneces- sary. da?????. ?e?? and da???? are interchangeable. The latter here picks up the last two lines of Sisyphus in ?2. ??d? ?a? ? ?e??. The first step in the argument is to deny divine omni- potence, as affirmed in the Callimachean quote. It has hitherto not been observed that A?tius' exempb are taken from Aristotle's Categories. Cf. 12b40-41 ?? ?a? e?d??eta? t? p?? ?????? e??a? ??d? t?? ????a ???a??a? ('for it is not possible for fire to be cold or snow to be black'); 12b 13-16 ?? ??? p?t? ? ?at?fas?? p??? t?? ?p?fas?? a?t??e?ta?, ???? t? ????ta???? ????ta?, ??t? ?a? t? ?f' e??te??? p????a a?t??e?ta?, t? ?a??s?a???? ?a??s?a? (example inspired by Plato, Soph. 263a-c). The reference to sedentary and upright only makes sense in the light of the Aristotelian background (why should God not be able to make what is sitting upright, since even for a human being that is hardly a problem, but it is impossible to be both at the same time). The examples used are taken from the realm of logic and given a theological application. The question of divine omnipotence was frequently discussed in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, but the exempb used differ from what we find in our text. I give some examples: - Alexander of Aphrodisias ap. Simpl. in De Caeb 358.27 ff. Heiberg and De fato 200.22 ff. Bruns: God cannot make diagonal commensure with side, two and two equal five, know the size of the infinite, make what has come into being indestructible (contra Plato Tun. 41a); - Galen, De usu partium 11.14: God cannot make man out of a stone,</page><page sequence="18">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 559 a bull or a horse out of ashes (contra Moses in Genesis; on this text cf. Walzer (1949), 23-32); - Pliny NH 2.27: God cannot commit suicide, make mortals eternal, cause a man who has lived not to have lived, undo the past, cause twice ten not to be twenty; - Celsus ap. Orig. CCeL?. 5.14: God cannot commit immoral acts or wish what is contrary to his nature, and so cannot bring about the re- surrection of the flesh. Alexander and Galen use examples from the realm of mathematics or physics (the latter is appropriate when arguing against the Platonic or the Mosaic cosmogony). The exempb in Pliny are closer to those of A?tius, since they involve contrary concepts (mortal-eternal, lived-not lived). A?tius' exempla do not appear to have any particular focus, except to refute the poetic quote. Philippson (1939), 21-23 points to at least three Epicurean texts that deal with the question of divine omnipotence. The first is certainly relevant: Lucretius 5.87-90 argues that those who observe the machinery of the cosmos and so believe the gods are all-powerful fall into superstition because 'they are ignorant of what can be and what can- not be, and of the fact that the power of everything is limited'. The pas- sage at Philodemus ?e?? ?e?? a????? Col. 7.2 Diels argues (if the recon- structions of Diels and Philippson are accepted) that God's lack of omnipo- tence does not affect his felicity. This differs from what A?tius argues here (but see further below ?9). The tetralemma at Lactantius De ira 13.19 is attributed to Epicurus (and so = fr. 374 Usener) as an argument against providence: either (i) God wishes to remove evil but cannot, or (ii) he can but does not so wish, or (iii) he both can and wishes, or (iv) he cannot and does not so wish, each alternative being theologically inacceptable. The same argument is found at Sext. Emp. PH 3.9-12, on which see further below at ?10. It is difficult to determine whether this argument was origi- nally Epicurean or Academic (for two differing opinions see Philippson (1939), 22, De Lacy (1948), 19). Given the wholly negative conclusion, the latter seems more likely. In Epicurean theology the main question is nei- ther divine omnipotence nor divine existence, but whether God can act against his own nature, quod non. After giving a long list of similar argu- ments, Pease at Cic. ND 3.92 rightly concludes: "... it will be seen that the elements here appearing were combined by philosophers of different schools to quite diverse ends". Finally we should inquire what the chronological implications of the citation of the Categories are. This work returned to prominence in the edi- tion of Aristotle's works by Andronicus (1st half of 1st century BCE). The first commentators are naturally Peripatetic. Wide dissemination outside</page><page sequence="19">560 DAVID T. RUNIA the Peripatetic school seems to have taken longer to achieve. The work is not referred to by Cicero. The first outsider to criticize them is the Platonist-Pythagorean Eudorus of Alexandria (? 25 BCE), and after him they turn up in Philo (the dating of the Stoic commentator Athenodorus is unclear). See further Szlezak (1972), 14?17, Moraux (1973-84), pasnm, Gottschalk (1987), 1099-1112, Mansfeld (1992b), 60. Although no hard conclusions can be reached, we are justified in concluding that this use of the Categories in a doxographical work is likely to have occurred no earlier than the beginning of our era. e? ?e?? est?. The condition is meant to remind us of the atheistic con- text (cf. also ?10). ?4. The argument now passes from what is logically impossible to what is impossible because it is against God's nature. Not the poets are attacked, but two respected philosophers, Plato and Anaxagoras. ???t?? ? ?e?a??f????. Exactly the same epithet used of Plato at Hermias Irrisw 11 (note that the context is Plato's three archai, God mat- ter model (!)), Ps. Justin, Coh. ad Or. 31.1. What is praised as sublimity in Ps. Longinus 13 is here attacked as bombast. On evaluations of Plato's style during the period 1st cent. BCE to 2nd cent. CE see the texts col- lected in D?rrie-Baltes (1990), 110-120. ? ?e?? ?p?ase t?? ??s??? p??? ea?t?? ?p?de???a. A distorted presen- tation of Plato's description of the coming into being of the cosmos in 77m. 29e-31b. Our author combines two statements: (a) the divine demiurge looks to an intelligible model so that the created copy would conform to the highest standard of rationality (cf. 30c); (b) the demiurge was good, and wished his product to be as similar as possible to himself (pa?ap??s?a ?a?t? 29e3). Encouraged by the Middle Platonist doctrine that places the ideas in God's mind, A?tius concludes that God created by using himself as model. In the Timaeus Plato uses the term pa??de???a on a number of occa- sions for the intelligible model (cf. 28a7, 37c8, 48e5, 49a 1). Combined with other central Platonist texts such as Rep. 592b and Parm. 132c, it becomes a central term in Platonist exposition of Plato's doctrines (see terminolog- ical table at Runia (1986), 160-161). Surprisingly here, however, we read ?p?de???a, a term which has no Platonic precedent. In Hellenistic Greek this term too can mean 'model' or 'pattern', but generally has the weaker meaning of 'example' (e.g. Polybius 3.17.8 'making himself an example (?p?de???a) for the crowd'). That A?tius wishes to use the word in the technical sense of an intelligible model is shown by the use of the prepo- sition p??? in the phrase '[by looking] at himself, which is standard in the</page><page sequence="20">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 561 'prepositional metaphysics' of Middle Platonism (cf. Runia (1986), 171-174). A remarkable parallel to A?tius' text is found in the Plato dox- ography included in the Vita Pbtonis at Diog. Laert. 3.71: 'The cosmos has been fashioned unique and not infinite, because the model (?p?de???a) from which it was created was also unique. And it is spherical (sfa???e?d?) because its creator also has such a shape.' We return to this parallel text further below. ??e? ????? ?e??ese?????. As the author indicates, the phrase is taken from ancient comedy, specifically Aristophanes Cbuds 398. The curious word ?e??es?????? appears to have been coined by the comic poet, per- haps with reference to the famous story told by Herodotus 2.2; see further the note ad be. in Dover (1968). The adjective is almost certainly meant to indicate a ridiculously archaic attitude, but the relevance of the moon is far from clear, and my translation is no more than an educated guess. Aristophanes does not here use the term ?????, but A?tius is no doubt aware that it is a very common term of abuse in the comic poets (see above on ?3). The context in Aristophanes deserves further notice. Socrates, here pre- sented as a natural philosopher, is posed questions on natural phenomena by the simple-minded Strepsiades, who asks where the thunderbolt which Zeus plainly uses against those who break oaths comes from. Socrates replies (398-400): ?a? p??, ? ???e s? ?a? ??????? d??? ?a? ?e??e- s????e, e?pe? ????e? t??? ep???????, d?t' ???? S????' ???p??se? ??d? ??e?????? ??d? T?????; This is naturally extremely apposite for the atheistic argument that an all-observant God might be required to avenge immoral behaviour (?2), but that such punishment does in fact not take place (as we shall see in ?10). This in fact seems a better context than the present one on Plato's doctrine of creation. For the abusive language in a similar Epicurean context, however, cf. Cic. ND 1.18 cited above on ?3, where Plato's demiurge is named and ridiculed, and the Stoic Providence is called an anus fatidica. a?tf ate?????. A?tius uses the dative with ate????? rather than the expected prepositional phrase (hence my translation 'to' rather than 'at'). Diels (1879), 59 notes this, comments that 'graecum non est, sed barbaro- rum qui novum testamentum scripserunt', and uses it as evidence to place the Epicurean source which A?tius copied verbatim somewhat later than Philodemus. There are indeed some 7 exx. in the New Testament of the usage with the dative. But since this is also found in the papyri, it is pre- sumably not a solecism but an example of Koine Greek (see Bauer et al. (1979), 119, to which add Jos. et Aseneth 8.8). p?? sfa???e?d? t?? ?e??, ??t? tape???te??? ?????p??. The direction</page><page sequence="21">562 DAVID T. RUMA of Plato's argument is reversed, apparently for satirical reasons. Plato had argued (77m. 29e, 33b) that the demiurge, because he was good, wished the cosmos to be as much like himself as possible (in its goodness), and so gave it the most perfect of all stereometrical shapes, i.e. made it into a per- fect sphere. Here it is argued that, since (a) the demiurge used himself as model, and (b) the cosmos is spherical in shape, the demiurge himself must be spherical too. The argument gets a polemical edge from discussions on God's shape (e?d??). For Platonists and Aristotelians God has no shape since he is immaterial and/or transcendent. For the Stoics God, though material, pervades the universe, so also does not have any definite shape (but the cosmos which 'contains' the totality of the divine is spherical). For the Epicureans, however, the gods were human in shape. This doctrine A?tius himself reports in his brief summary of Epicurean theology at the end of this chapter (Ps.Plut. 1.7, 882A, Stob. Eel. 1.29 ad fin., cf. also Ps.Plut. 1.6, 880D). The reason given at Cic. ND 1.48-49 is that there is no shape more beautiful than the human form (i.e. the same reasoning as in Plato, but applied to the nature of the gods, not to the creation of the cos- mos). The doctrine is heavily ridiculed by Cotta at ibid. 93-102, who uses a tone very similar to that of A?tius here and Velleius earlier in ND I (note esp. 94, tota commenticia vix digna lucubratione anicubrum). Earlier Velleius ridicules Plato's account of demiurgic creation (?19) and the arbitrary nature of the view that the cosmos is spherical (?24), but the question of the demiurge's model is not addressed. At 5.181-186 Lucretius argues that the gods could not have had a model for creating the cosmos, but there is no reference to Plato, and the argument is couched in terms of the Epicurean doctrine of p???????; cf. Bailey (1947), 1345. An interesting parallel for A?tius' depiction of the model is found in the Plato doxography at Diog. Laert. 3.71 Long: t??t? d? d?????????a ?p??e?s?a? t?? ???t?st?? a?t???, ?'?a te a?t?? ?a? ??? ?pe???? ?ate- s?e??s?a?, dt? ?a? t? ?p?de???a e? ?? af' ?? a?t?? ?d????????se? sfa???e?d? d? d?a t? ?a? t?? ?e???sa?ta t????t?? e?e?? s???a, e?e???? ??? ??? pe????e?? ta ???a ??a, t??t?? d? ta s???ata p??t??. Just as in A?tius, Plato's God is considered to be spherical. We noted earlier that both texts use the same rather unusual term for the model. There is, how- ever, no implicit connection between model, the shape of God and of the cosmos, as in A?tius. Moreover the Plato doxography does not add the comparison with man's shape, which almost certainly has a specifically Epicurean background. It cannot be considered certain, therefore, that the resemblances indicate use of Platonic sources by A?tius. The date of the doxography in Diogenes Laertius is controversial. It could range from end of 1st cent. BCE to the 2nd cent. CE (the hypothesis of Untersteiner con- necting it exclusively with Posidonius has been universally rejected).</page><page sequence="22">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 563 ?5^?6. A?tius now gives a brief account of two differing conceptions of demiurgic creation. In the case of both Anaxagoras and Plato, cosmic order is the work of a divine Mind (Nous). The difference is in the initial situation confronted by God. In the former case the bodies to be given order were stationary, in the latter case they were in disorderly movement. In ?7 it will emerge that both views have a common fault. ? d' '??a?a???a?... ? d? ???t??... A?tius' procedure here is very typi- cal of his doxographical method. He uses the diaeresis to make a distinc- tion between two philosophical positions, i.e. demiurgic creation d?a??s??s?? bodies initially stationary bodies initially in movement It is easy to see how here the doxa is more important than the philosopher holding the view. In the theological context, however, the distinction seems rather pedantic. In Cicero's ND the Epicurean Velleius attacks Plato and the Stoa, but refers to Anaxagoras only in the long doxography of individual theologi- cal views (?27). For Philippson (1939), 26 this was evidence that both Cicero and A?tius have their ultimate source in Epicurus (but for Cicero an intermediate source must be postulated). There is no evidence, howev- er, that Epicurus attacked Anaxagoras' view of demiurgic creation (Lucretius 1.830 ff. attacks his doctrine of the archai). Sextus Empiricus too refers to Anaxagoras in his discussion on archai (PH 3.32, Adv. Phys. 1.6), but not in his account of theology. At Adv. Phys. 1.105-106 Plato is includ- ed in the list of philosophers who infer God's existence from the d?a??s??s?? of the universe. The texts cited are Tim. 29d7~30a2, 30b4?cl. The second text ends with mention of the god's (i.e. demiurge's) p?????a. ??? ?st???ta. By placing these words straight after the name-label, A?tius underlines the diaeresis he is making. This account of Plato's doctrine, based on Tim. 30a4?6, is fairly accu- rate, and, unlike in ?4, does not aim at polemical distortion. It is some- what imprecise to say that the p??ta s??ata were in disorder before cre- ation. Plato states?rather obscurely?that there were only traces of the</page><page sequence="23">564 DAVID T. RUNIA elements in the receptacle (53b) and that they then were formed into reg- ular geometric shapes (53c~55c). d?? ?a? ? ?e??. The conjunction implies divine concern with the disorderly state of the world, which is of course the point under discussion. ?7. A?tius now proceeds to criticize the conception of demiurgic creation that has been outlined in ?4?6. ?????? ??? ??a?t????s?? a?f?te???. This is the last of five occasions in which A?tius uses the word ??a?t??? in a set formula in order to criticize a doxa: cf. Ps.Plut. 1.2, 875D (Tha?es), 1.3, 876A (twice of Anaxi- mander), 1.3, 876B (Anaximenes). Mansfeld (1990), 3206 f. sees here rem- nants of Peripatetic dialectic, perhaps going back to Theophrastus. Certainly the second objection against Anaximander?that he makes his principle material, and denies the efficient cause?goes back to Aristotle: cf. Met. A 3 983b7-984a27. For the use of ??a?t??? in a doxographical context see also Aristotle Phys. 4.5 213a24. At Ps.Plut. 1.5, 879A-B A?tius also argues against Plato's argumentation proving that the cosmos is unique and uncreated. Mansfeld (ibid.) points out that we have evidence to show that such counter-arguments were put forward in Theophrastus' Physikai doxai. Does, then, A?tius' argument here come from the same source? We have no direct evidence in the surviving works of Aristotle and Theophrastus, but it is likely that the subject was broached in Aristotle's De phibsophia, which contained an attack on Plato's Timaeus (cf. esp. Philo Aet. 10-12, = De phil. fr. 18 Ross). But the formulation of A?tius' counter- argument requires further examination. t?? ?e?? ep???sa? ?p?st?ef??e??? t?? a????p????. The word ep???sa? refers primarily to the argument, but perhaps also has overtones of 'fiction', as seen from the atheist position. A?tius' counter-position clear- ly involves a jump in the argument, for in ?4?6 neither Plato nor Anaxagoras are concerned with the question of divine providence in rela- tion to human affairs. It is clear that the view attacked is at least partly that of the Stoics (cf. Mansfeld (1990), 3207, but see also further our final remark on this paragraph below). It is the Stoic position that the cosmos exists for the sake of man, and is ordered for this purpose by the provi- dential deity: cf. Velleius' polemical remarks at Cic. ND 1.23 and Balbus' defence at 2.133-162. Lucretius attacks this position at great length in 5.156-234. In Sextus the subject of providence is not explicitly raised in the section on theology in Adv. Phys. I (though it is implicit throughout 74-122). It does occur, however, in the corresponding section in PH. See the diaeresis at 3.9 (clearly related to that at Cic. ND 1.2 discussed above in our comments on ?1): ? ????? e??a? ?e?? ?t?? p????e?? a?t?? t?? ??</page><page sequence="24">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 565 ??s?? f?s?? ? ?? p????e??, ?a? e? ?e? p????e??, ?t?? p??t?? ? t????. The diaeresis can be illustrated as follows: divinity non-existence existence no providence providence partial total A more detailed example of the same diaeresis is found at Epictetus 1.12.3. Ps.Galen's discussion of theological questions at Hist. Phil. 16 (text at Diels (1879), 608-609) runs parallel to Sextus 3.2-12, but fills in the name- labels, opposing first the Stoics (partial providence, i.e. only for the virtu- ous) to Epicurus (no providence at all), and then adding Plato (total prov- idence). A dissident diaeresis is found at Nemesius De nat. horn. 43, 126.22 Morani, where the Stoics are denied belief in providence on account of their fatalism. t? ?a?????? ?a? ?f?a?t?? ?f??. This prescriptive description of God, affirming that God is an existent living being (?f??) who is not subject to destruction and decay (?f?a?t??) and enjoys perfect felicity (?a??????) is recognizably Epicurean: see esp. Ep. ad Men. 123, where the deity is described according to the ????? ???s?? as ?f?? ?f?a?t?? ?a? ?a??????; also Kyriai Doxai no. 1 (= Diog. Laert. 10.139), Ep. ad Her. 78, fr. 65.36 Arrighetti, Cic. ND 1.45-49 etc. In certain texts this 'definition' of the divine explicitly or implicitly refers to the Epicurean tradition: e.g. Clem. Alex. Str. 6.104.3, Josephus AJ 10.278, Lucian Iupp. Trag. 20 (note p???- ?ata), Nemesius De nat. horn. 43, 127.2, Philo Sacr. 95 (copied at Clem. Alex. Str. 5.68.1), Plut. Mor. 420E, 655D, 1103D. There are, however, other texts in which the characteristics of immortality and felicity are used to characterize divinity without any particular reference to Epicurean ideas: e.g. Clem. Alex. Str. 5.83, Dion. Hal. Ant. 1.77, Philo Deus 26, Somn. 1.94, Plut. Mor. 358E. Three texts in A?tius' exact contemporary Plutarch are particularly interesting for our context. (1) At De superstitwne 165B he describes atheism as a ???s?? fa??? t?? ??d?? e??a? ?a?????? ?a? ?f?a?t??. (2) In his De communibus notitiis adv. Stoicos 1074F-1075A he again alludes to this con-</page><page sequence="25">566 DAVID T. RUMA ception of the deity and then argues that the atheists such as Theodore, Diagoras and Hippo did not disagree with the conception, but rather denied that any indestructible being exists. (3) At De Stoicorum repugnantiis 1051E-F, arguing against Chrysippus, he cites verbatim the Stoic Antipater of Tarsus who writes in his work ?e?? ?e?? : p?? d? t?? s??pa?t?? ????? t?? ?????e?a? ?? e???e? pe?? ?e?? d?a ??a???? ?p????????e?a. ?e?? t????? ?????e? ?f?? ?a?????? ?a? ?f?a?t?? ?a? e?p???t???? a????p??. Here exactly the same formula as in our text?but slightly expanded in a way that would be quite inacceptable for an Epicurean?is taken as the starting point for a theological discourse. Finally we should examine the theological texts in Sextus Empiricus. Our phrase is cited four times. In PH 3.4 it describes the general dogma- tist position: a??' ?f?a?t?? t?, fas?, ?a? ?a?????? ?????sa?, t?? ?e?? e??a? t??t? ?????e. At PH 3.219 it is cited with specific reference to Epicurus for the position denying providence. Similary at Adv. Phys. 1.44 refutation of Epicurus is the primary aim. The most interesting text, how- ever, is Adv. Phys. 1.33, in which the sceptic argues against the view that our conception of God was inculcated by law-givers: ???' ?s?? t?? p?? t??t?? p??t?? f?se?, dt? ?? pa?' ???st??? ??????ta? ?a? ??e???e? ???p?asa? t?? t??a?t?? ???s??, ?a? d?a t??t? ????? ?????? ?e??? ?p???e?? ?p??a???. ?pe? ?st?? e???e?? ?????? ??? p???? p??????? e???s? p??te? ?????p?? pe?? ?e??, ?a?' ?? ?a?????? t? ?st? ?f?? ?a? ?f?a?t?? ?a? t??e??? ?? e?da??????? ?a? pa?t?? ?a??? ??ep?de?t??, te???? d? ?st?? ?????? t? ?at? t???? p??ta? t??? a?t??? ?p?????e?? ?d???as??, ???a ?? f?s???? ??t?? ?????e?s?a?. ?? t????? ??se? ??d? ?at? t??a ?????es?a? pa?ed??a?t? ?? pa?a??? t?? a????p?? e??a? ?e???. The description of God given here is so close to that of A?tius that they could be a paraphrase of each other. A?tius, however, adds the theme of providence which is missing in Sextus' text. On the other hand the con- text of the fabrication of the notion of deity by a law-giver is precisely that of A?tius ?2. Sextus argues against, because from his sceptical position this atheist view is also dogmatist. To conclude, the description of the deity here is recognizably Epicurean, but not exclusively so. It also corresponds to the generally accepted 'common conception' of what God is. ??ep?st?ef?? ?st? t?? a????p???? p?a???t??. To the general con- ception of what God is, is now added the specific Epicurean interpreta- tion, namely that it excludes divine involvement in human concerns. The argument thus has now turned from what God cannot do (?3) to what God does not do because it is against his nature. I have translated the Greek word p????ata with 'concerns' because it has a double resonance. It can</page><page sequence="26">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 567 mean 'affairs' or 'activities', but also can have the sense of 'troubles' or 'bothers'. Thus in K.D. 1 Epicurus states that the divine itself has no p???- ?ata and also does not impose them on others. ?a??da????. I.e. the direct opposite to e?da????, which God is. e???t?? d???? ?a? t??t????. Constructive activity involves labour and interaction with matter. It must interfere with divine felicity, either because it involves effort to make the calculations required in dealing with mater- ial necessity, or because the material world once created is ever liable to corruption and decay, and so needs constant maintenance. For the analo- gy with a builder compare esp. the polemical satire of Plato's demiurgic fashioning of the cosmos at Cic. ND 1.19; further texts on this standard analogy given at Runia (1986), 168. For Epicurus this cosmos came into being through chance, and not through divine intervention. It is very like- ly, however, that Epicurus' conception of divine activity (or lack thereof) was at least in part inspired by Aristotle's attack on Plato's Timaeus, of which traces are found at Philo Aet. 10-12 and also De Caeb 2.1 (the doom of Ixion). Creative activity, whether at the level of the Demiurge or of the World Soul is not compatible with the divine (cf. Bos (1989), 185 ff., but we do not enter into controversies over the possible development of Aristotle's theology; for further connections between Epicurus and Aristotle's mature theology cf. Merlan (1967)). Cf. also Ps.Aristotle, De mundo 6, 397b22, the highest god does not endure the laborious life of a laborer or a beast of burden. In the Aristotelian view there is divine gov- ernance of the cosmos, but it does not involve God in any toil. According to Velleius at Cic. ND 1.52 the Stoic god who exercises providence is bbo- nosissimus. Both Plato and the Stoa are the object of the argument's attack. The phrase ?e?????? e?? t?? t?? ??s??? ?atas?e??? returns, however, to the building metaphor associated with Plato rather than the Stoa (for the latter the equivalent would be d?a??s??s??). ?8-9. A further argument directed at the conception of divine creation as envisaged by Plato and Anaxagoras. ?? ?????s??. Plato and Anaxagoras are meant, as is shown by the ref- erence to the diaeresis of ?5-6 in the following line (dt' ?? a????ta ta s??ata ? at??t?? ????e?t?). ?t?? ... ? ... ? ... The structure of the argument is straightforward enough, and has been indicated by means of Roman and Greek numbers in the translation. See also the schematic analysis given at Effe (1970), 25. The argument proceeds by combining modus tollens with the method of exhaustion. Thus: if p, then either q or r or s, but neither q nor r nor s, therefore not p. If it can be shown that q or r or s exhaust the conse-</page><page sequence="27">568 DAVID T. RUMA quences of ? (implicit in the argument, i.e. if God created the cosmos), then ? can be considered to be refuted. There is, however, a slight peculiarity in the presentation of the possi- bilities to be exhausted. The first alternative is that God did not exist before he created, which is incompatible with his eternity, as assumed in the common conception of divinity outlined in ?7. The second and third alternatives are that he is asleep or awake, both of which are dealt with. But A?tius also adds a fourth alternative, that he does neither, which is not specifically addressed. There is no need to, because waking and sleeping are contradictories. The only way out is to say that God is dead or non- existent, which brings us back either to the first or to the second alterna- tive (where death is equivalent to eternal sleep). We note, however, that these rejected possibilities are highly interesting for the atheistic position. One can accept that God must be as 'defined' in the common conception, but conclude that no existent fits the bill (the argument of Theodore et alii as outlined by Plutarch at Mor. 1075A cited above). Attention has been drawn to this argument by Effe (1970), 23?25 in his study on the cosmology and theology of Aristotle's De phibsophia. He agrees with Diels and others that the whole passage in which it occurs has an Epicurean origin, but then affirms that it demonstrates a form of argu- mentation which deviates from the rest of the passage from both the struc- tural and the stylistic point of view?the former because of its a priori character, the latter because it is objective (sachlich), and does not reveal the sharp, polemical tone of the rest of the passage. The author has tried to smoothen the transition to the inserted piece with his words ?a? p???? and d? ?????s?, but the procedure is transparent. Effe's case so far is whol- ly unconvincing. It is apparent that the argument fits in the context extremely well because (1) it explicitly picks up the theme of creation set out in ?5-6, and (2) its argumentation turns on the two characteristics of deity as set out in the 'common conception' in ?7, i.e. God's indestruc- tibility (and thus also eternity a parte ante) and his felicity. On the other hand the parallels in structure and method that he notes with Philo Aet. 39-43 (= De phil. fr. 19c Ross) are real enough. It is not unlikely that the argument was originally devised by Aristotle in order to argue against the Platonic conception of demiurgic creation (see above on ?7). Appropriation by Epicurus and his followers is also more than plausible. As Efle further points out (25-31), the same argument lies at the basis of two further pas- sages, in Lucr. 5.168-175 and Velleius at Cic. ND 1.21-22 (here with an ironic tone). If the tetralemma referred to above in our comments on ?3 was indeed used by Epicurus (which is not certain), then it is clear that he too used argumentation similar to that used in this argument. Effe's mis-</page><page sequence="28">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 569 take is to conclude that the argument in question is an insertion (Einschub, p. 25). For this reason his conclusion that the passage should have the same status as 'fragment' of De phibsophia as fr. 19a-c Ross at Philo Aet. 20-44 is equally dubious. In Epicurean descriptions of the felicitous life of the gods we read much about tranquillity and rest, but not specifically that it is free from sleep; cf. Lucr. 3.18-24, 6.58-78 (but the promise at 5.155 is unfulfilled), Cic. ND 1.52. Lactantius De ira 17.2 (= Usener, Epicurea fr. 360) equates the gods' tranquillity with sleep and death, but that is a polemical view. Philippson (1939), 26 draws attention to the fact that this view of the sleeplessness of the gods appears to be modified by Philodemus in his treatise On the way of life of the gods (?e?? ?e?? ??????), col. 12-13 Diels, where it is argued that the occasional doze will not be incompatible with Epicurean theolo- gy. Woodward (1989), 30 argues that this is likely to have been an inno- vation of Philodemus himself (but he is unable to give chapter and verse in his assertion that divine sleeplessness was the orthodox Epicurean posi- tion). Philippson be. cit. concludes that A?tius' Epicurean source must therefore not be sought among the later Epicureans, but this is probably taking the text of Philodemus too seriously. ?10. The final argument sets aside the question of divine creation, and specifically addresses the theme of divine providence as it concerns human life. e?pe? ? ?e?? est?. This first condition is otiose if the argument is pure- ly about whether the gods are or are not provident, i.e. the Stoa versus Epicurus. It recalls, however, the question of whether the deity does or does not exist, as introduced in ?1-2. t? ?e? ???d???? e?t??e?. The term ???d???? is perhaps a little sur- prising in the context (the opposite of ?ste??? is usually fa????). Literally the word means 'adulterated' and is often used of coins. Here it is perhaps chosen because of the adulterous examples that follow. The argument is that divine existence and divine providence are ren- dered problematic because a provident god would not allow good people to suffer evil. It must be agreed that this argument does not flow directly from the 'common conception' of divinity put forward in ?7. To God's felicity and immortality the further characteristic of benevolence must be added. In the philosophical tradition this had been the standard view since Plato and Aristotle (e.g. Tim. 29e, Met. 983a3). But the Epicurean would argue that if the gods are not provident, the problem melts away. The same applies afortion for the atheist, because in his view there are no gods at all.</page><page sequence="29">570 DAVID T. RUNIA The argument is thus directed against a form of theodicy such as we find in the Stoa, and earlier in Plato Laws X. Is it possible to pin down its origin? A good place to begin is in the dialogue De Providentia of Philo. At 2.3-14 Alexander puts forward the case against providence. Examples of the flourishing of the unjust are Polycrates and Dionysius the Elder, exam- ples of the suffering of the just are Socrates, Zeno of Elea, Anaxarchus. Very similar exx. are found in similar contexts at Cic. ND 3.82-83, Plut. Mor. 1051C-D. For further exx. see Pease's note on the Ciceronian text, and also the investigation on Philo's sources at Wendland (1892), 47-50. Wendland rightly states that the position defended in the argument can be attributed either to the Epicurean or the Academic tradition. He then goes on to argue that analysis of the Ciceronian passage demonstrates that the source of the argument and the examples must be the Academic Carneades. Even if this is right, as seems not unlikely, it should be recog- nized that the stock examples could have been used in both Academic and Epicurean discussions of the subject. In Philodemus On Death (?e?? ?a??- t??) xxxv col. 6.31, 347 Mekler, the three philosophers Socrates, Zeno and Anaxarchus are mentioned as having unfortunate deaths (the result of t???), but the context is ethical rather than theological. Of more direct interest in relation to the A?tian passage is the fact that at Cicero ND 3.89 Diagoras is asked by a friend, 'y?u&gt; who think the gods ignore human affairs, do you not notice from all the painted votive tablets you see how many people through vows to the gods have escaped the vio- lence of the storm and reached the harbour in safety', to which he point- edly replies 'rightly so, because the votive tablets of who were shipwrecked and perished in the sea were never painted'. We note here that the athe- ist Diagoras (as he is taken to be in the doxographic literature) adopts what might be taken as an Epicurean position, but that there is little doubt that he is invoked here because he is an atheist (cf. the second anecdote in the same passage, where he defends himself against the accusation that he is a Jonah figure by pointing to other ships who are also in trouble without their having a blasphemer aboard). Finally we note a slightly different tradition that can be traced back to a section of the recently rediscovered Melamobgy of Theophrastus pub- lished by H. Daiber. Theophrastus is of course no atheist: he accepts that God is the 'cause of the world's arrangement and order' (?14.16; see text in Daiber (1992), 270). But if one looks at the phenomenon of the thun- derbolt one sees that there is no rhyme of reason to it. Thunderbolts fall on uninhabited mountains; they also strike the best people while avoiding evildoers (?14.21-25)! Mansfeld (1992c), 320 in a stimulating article on this text points out that the argument recalls the passage in Aristophanes Cbuds</page><page sequence="30">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 571 earlier alluded to in our passage (see above on ?4). But the (perhaps abbre- viated) text of Theophrastus gives no examples of people who were struck down. '??a??????... '??a????. The two examples used of noble men suffer- ing an unjust and undeserved fate are taken from mythology and litera- ture. This differs from the standard examples mentioned in the previous note, who are primarily philosophers (Cicero adds Roman exempb). I have found no parallels for the use of these examples in arguments on theodi- cy. Nor would we expect Agamemnon to be used as such, at least not in the Epicurean tradition, for his actions at Aulis make him into an exam- ple of superstition (cf. the famous passage at Lucretius 1.82-100, where his action is described as 'wicked and impious'). Because these examples deviate from the tradition, as noted above, we may suggest that they have been deliberately chosen. The emphasis is in fact placed as much on the treachery of the crimes as on the nobility of the sufferers (hence the term ???d????, as noted above). The crimes were hatched in secret and carried out through betrayal. The possibility must be considered that A?tius wishes the argument to revert back to the athe- istic view outlined through the persona of Sisyphus in ?2. Gods have been invented in order to prevent crime. But not everyone is gullible, and cer- tainly not the atheists themselves. The fact that perpretrators of crime flourish not only shows that there is no providence, but also throws great doubt on the gods' very existence. Nevertheless it may be that the examples used do give a clue to their provenance. In Cicero ND 3.65-73 and 3.90 diverse lines of poetry are cited on the Atreidae and also the murder of Heracles by Deianira is men- tioned in arguments against the Stoic doctrine of providence. The context of the arguments differs from our source to some degree. Medea and Atreus are cited as examples where human rationality is misused, i.e. the gift of providence brings on evil. In ?70 Deianira is cited as an example of someone who wishes to do good and achieves evil. In ?91 Aegisthus, the murderer of Agamemnon, is cited as an example where there is no need to postulate the interference of heaven. It can hardly be denied that the direction and method of the argument is very similar to what we find in A?tius, except that the theme of theodicy is less explicitly invoked. Moreover it is almost certain that Cicero's source here is Academic (per- haps Carneades via Clitomachus; cf. Pease (1955-58), 1.48, Kleywegt (1961)). As was noted earlier (?7), Sextus does not specifically discuss the ques- tion of providence at any length. His final argument in his section ?e?? ?e?? indicates, however, how he would tackle the question, PH 3.12: e?</page><page sequence="31">572 DAVID T.

When we consider that in ?4 he proceeds from the 'common conception' of God's nature, that in ?10-11 he discusses the question of God's power (cf. A?tius ?3) and in ?11 he combines the questions of providence and existence, we must conclude there are considerable affinities with our passage, even if Sextus does not link up his doxai and arguments with any specific philoso- phers and schools, as A?tius does. ??????. Diels (1879), 59 perceptively notes that this word ?????? (he wrongly reads ????a???) gives some chronological clues. Before the second cent. CE it is very rare, except remarkably enough in the Septuagint (8 times) and the New Testament (9 times). The only example is in Aeschines Socraticus (4th cent. BCE). Then in the 2nd century it occurs regularly in Aristides, Justin, Clement, Athenaeus etc. It is thus likely to be the contri- bution of A?tius himself. Diels, however, uses it to place his (Epicurean) source later than Philodemus (followed by Philippson (1939), 26). On the examples of murder and adultery found in Cicero ND III see the previous note. 5. Concluswn It has not proved an easy task to analyse and furnish a Sitz im Z???n for the passage which we have examined in detail. Partly the diffi- culty is caused by the fact that it forms an exception within A?tius' doxography. Instead of merely recounting and organizing views of philosophers, it also presents arguments. The connections between these arguments are not very clearly indicated, so that the passage as a whole lacks overt coherence. Nevertheless our analysis bore out that awareness of two doxographical techniques can help in under- standing it. Firsdy in doxography it is the doxai that count in the first instance, rather than the philosophers who maintain them. Secondly doxography has a great fondness for the diaeresis and the disjunction which allow views to be organized and opposed to each other. In the case of our passage the view being maintained is that God or the gods do not exist, i.e. the atheistic position introduced at its</page><page sequence="32">ATHEISTS IN A?TIUS 573 outset. This view emerges from the basic disjunction between the- ism and atheism. A further disjunction results from the theistic view: if the deity exists, either it relates to the cosmos (through creation and providence) or it does not. On the basis of this diaeresis with its two disjunctions, the fol- lowing argument can be discerned: (a) some philosophers deny God's existence (?1) (b) God's existence is a lie invented to ensure righteous behav- iour(?2) (c) According to the lie there is a blessed eternal being who sees all (?2) (d) God is not omnipotent (?3) (e) Creation as conceived by Plato &amp; Anaxagoras is against God's nature as commonly conceived (?4-7) (f) His blessed nature as commonly conceived precludes creation and concern with human affairs (?7-9) (g) God's existence and providence would make the flourishing of evil and the suffering of the good inexplicable (?10). The greatest difficulty in the analysis is the transition from (c) to (d) at the beginning of ?3. The final poetic couplet quoted in ?2 patent- ly introduces the remainder of the passage. Does it argue that the first line about a flourishing eternal deity is correct, but the second about a provident deity is incorrect, i.e. an Epicurean view? Or does it argue that both lines are 'poetic nonsense', i.e. the atheistic view? I have argued that the 'he says' in ?3 continues the atheistic position introduced at the outset, and that the final argument at ?10 is meant to show that any form of theism is unpersuasive, including even the idea of a fictional theism introduced in ?2. In the commentary an attempt has been made to locate the argu- ments in their context in diverse ancient philosophical traditions. It has long been perceived that there are important affinities with Epicurean texts in Cicero ND I and Lucretius. These induced Diels, Philippson and Winiarczyck to argue that the passage as a whob, including the use of the sceptical-academic Atheistenkatabg^ was taken from an Epicurean source. This hypothesis does not convince. The arguments at ?3 and ?10 (and to a lesser extent ?8-9) contain fea- tures that are not Epicurean. It is better to look for traditions than to speculate on specific sources. It is clear that some Epicurean ele-</page><page sequence="33">574 DAVID T. RUMA ments have been incorporated (esp. in ?4). Moreover, reference to atheists was part of the Epicurean tradition. In our commentary we found numerous affinities with Sceptical (mainly Academic) argu- ments on theology as found in the vast collection of Sextus Empiricus which go far beyond mere use of the Atheistenkatabg. Especially important is the use of the theological diaeresis with the double disjunction, a standard Sceptical procedure. Even the use of the 'common conception5 of what God is, is as much Sceptical as it is Epicurean. Various affinities with Academic arguments in Cicero ND III are also important. For the understanding of the passage as a whole the Sceptical background is in our view more important than the specific Epicurean arguments. Finally there are various clues pointing to the interventions of A?tius himself. We noted the use of the antithetical diaeresis in ?5-6 and the way he introduces his criticism in ?7. Two hitherto unobserved parallels suggest a date no earlier than the beginning of our era, and may thus be indica- tions of A?tius' own intervention: (a) the use of examples from Aristot?e's Categories in ?3; (b) similarities to the Plato doxography in Diogenes Laertius (?4). A brilliant lexical observation by Diels (?10) also points to the 1st cent. CE. Finally we note the interesting par- allels in A?tius' contemporary Plutarch, in which the common conception of God's nature is opposed to atheistic views. To sum up: there are three main strands of tradition in this pas- sage, the Sceptical, the Epicurean, and the doxographical (with some Aristotelian views further in the background, and some Middle Platonism just starting to make its presence felt). What brings these strands together in our passage is the shared concern with the atheist position. For the Epicurean this view is in conflict with our common conception of the deity; for the Sceptic it is a dogmatist position that must be undermined; for our doxographer it forms part of his comprehensive survey of theological views. 2333 AE LEIDEN, Rijnsburgerweg 116 BIBLIOGRAPHY C.
