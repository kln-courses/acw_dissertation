Based on the pioneer efforts of G. A. Rösch during the 1920's, the researches of Von Frisch and of his fellow investigators will surely abide as one of the most impressive achievements of contemporary science. To be fully savored - for their thorough- ness, rigor, and elegance and, indeed, for sheer exhilaration - one should follow his verba ipsissima, perhaps most readily available in a collection of three lectures delivered in the course of a tour of the United States early in 1949.1 ♦ Professor of Linguistics, and Chairman of the Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics, Indiana University.

XXIV, NO. 1 From the vantage point of human communication, the story of the dancing bees has sometimes been treated as a kind of scientific parable, a primitive behavior pattern from which vari- ous Aesopian lessons may be drawn. Thus, one of the most emi- nent psychologists of language, Karl Bühler, citing an early monograph by Von Frisch, argued - metaphorically anticipat- ing a cybernetic model - that no animal community can exist without a steering mechanism guiding the social relations of the community members, and that this entails an interchange of signs as much as an interchange of matter: "Und diese Steuer- ungsmittel die wir exact beobachten können , sind das vor- menschliche Analogon zur Sprache" ("And these steering mechanisms which we can observe precisely are the prehuman analogue of language"). A systematic interchange of matter among the members of an animal community is, in fact, in- conceivable to Bühler, without an accompanying interchange of signs, which leads him to conclude, " soweit muss eine bi- ologisch wohlfundierte Sprachtheorie ausholen and dann noch eine letzte Horizonterweiterung vornehmen r" ("that a biolog- ically well-founded theory of language must reach out so far and then undertake still a last broadening of the horizon").2 Viewing language from an anthropological perspective, Al- fred Kroeber repeatedly turned his attention to comparisons and contrasts with communication systems in other species, no- tably the bee. His particular concern was to illuminate the dis- tinction between signs and symbols as to both their mechanism and their function. "I have discussed the facts with several linguists," he wrote, but [we} "seemed to take the attitude that the bees' informations must be mere signs or signals," and "scarcely tried to analyze away the symbolic nature of these informations." He therefore undertook to examine the matter more closely. While, in so doing, he shed light on several facets 2 Karl Bühler, Sprachtbeorie (Jena, Germany, 1934), pp. vi-vii.

Apis Gyula mellifera Laziczius, as a source of insights about Homo sapiens. Gyula Laziczius, in an attempt to elucidate the three constitutive factors of verbal communication which were so fashionable in his day - the emo- tive, the conative, and the referential - described the last as the "most human" of all: the bee, he explained, can be the source of a message and its destination, but the message does not denote, that is, it has no cognitive function. If one were to transmute such messages into human speech, they would be interjections: from the addresser's standpoint they generate ten- sion, and from the addressee's they are imperatives.4 It must be remembered that these remarks of Laziczius were, like Biih- ler's, based on Von Frisch' s early work ; but while the formal properties of this communication system had been accurately observed and meticulously described even then, it took two more decades to crack the code. John Lötz5 has pointed out how instructive it may be "to those linguists who exclude the study of meaning from linguistics proper" to follow the un- folding of this story: After his first hypothesis was refuted, that of a two- word code, with the round dance standine for pollen and the wiggling dance for the nectar, the dance was inter- preted as a symptom of general excitement, without fur- ther meaning. In 1946, however, Von Frisch himself was 'Alfred L.

XXIV, NO. 1 able to prove that the dance represented a method of conveying very explicit information, (p. 228) Lötz was also the first linguist to make a structural analysis of bee communication, with a view to providing a basis for systematic comparison with the structure of language. The fea- tures which distinguish language from the fabric of bee com- munication were concisely enumerated by Lötz, and, repeating him, reassayed by linguists Emile Benveniste,6 and, in a broader framework, Charles F. Hockett.7 During the very decade in which these various glottocentric interpretations were being sharpened and called to the attention of linguists, however, mudi was happening in biology. Zoology and psychology had converged and a special discipline called ethology had matured, which comprehends, in the narrow sense, the comparative anat- omy of gesture of animal species or, more broadly, the scientific study of animal behavior. Important advances were being an- nounced in the phylogenetic analysis of more or less complex signalling movements, directed towards members of the same species or those of other species sharing the actor's environ- ment. As for the bee, it was gradually revealed that all the essential characteristics of the actor's performance in the com- munication dance are found in other insects, but that their com- bined potentialities for social regulation have remained unreal- ized elsewhere. The widely accepted belief that the bee's field of semantic reference is rigidly restricted to information about the location of food and its quality was then shattered by Martin Lindauers discovery that an almost identical code is used in indicating possible sites for a future hive.

The book brings together pertinent facts uncovered since Von Frisch's time in our midst and focuses on four specific problem areas: are there simple, elementary (phylogenetically older) forms of communication in Apis mellifera which might turn out to be components of the dance? Does the dance occur in related spe- cies and genera, and, if so, in what forms and with what sig- nificance? Does the dance reveal previously unsuspected ranges of meaning? And finally, what is the physiology of the sensory mechanisms through which information is transferred? The opening sentence of Lindauer's text reads: "In the last analysis, all animals are social beings." The chief implication of this assertion is that all organic alliances presuppose a meas- ure of communication: protozoa interchange signals, an ag- gregate of cells becomes an organism by virtue of the fact that the component cells can influence one another. Metazoa assem- ble in various kinds of alliances. Minimally, they must come together to form a temporary tandem for mating, thus enabling their species to continue. When the sexual partners remain to- gether until the offspring appear, we may speak of a family community, that is, a group whose members stay together but become functionally differentiated - a type of process realized in most dramatic fashion by insect colonies. On the other hand, members of a species not necessarily stemming from one mother may come together and become integrated into "inter- est communities," joined together, for instance, for mutual pro- tection - like a school of dolphins. In all such unions - whether transient or persistent, closed or open, divergent or convergent, simple or complex - creatures of the same species must locate and identify each other; moreover, they must give information as to what niche they occupy in territory as well as status in the social hierarchy, and as to their momentary mood. It has been pointed out that a linguist approaching a totally unknown language acts as a cryptanalyst: he receives messages not destined for him and not knowing their code. The student of animal communication also resembles a cryptanalyst, but he 63</page><page sequence="6">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 1 is faced with some problems which need not occupy the ob- server of speech. Thus, initially, he cannot even be sure through what physical channel or channels the presumed messages are being transmitted. Since "any form of energy propagation can be exploited for communication purposes,"8 and many forms are, in fact, at the disposal of animals, one of his first tasks is to specify the sense or constellation of senses employed in the message-processing situations which he is observing. When describing speech phenomena, many linguists, at the crossroads of conflicting approaches, continue to employ a mixed nomen- clature, drawing for their technical vocabulary now on articu- latory, now on acoustic, and sometimes on perceptual phonetics. The resulting montage may show seams, but the total picture makes sense. The zoologist, attempting to identify communica- tion in a given group of animals, may likewise define the event by the manner in which the signal is encoded, passed on, or de- coded. However, the classification chosen leads one into quite different realms of discourse, which appear far from being blended into a harmonious synthesis. Sometimes the action of an effector organ is featured, for instance, in the description of the signalling system of fireflies. At other times, properties of the intervening medium are emphasized, for instance, in studies of the sonic (and ultrasonic) emissions of the bottlenose dol- phin, where excellent spectrographic representations of signals- plus-noise have not yet been supplemented by a definitive description of the underlying mechanism to explain the results, let alone the "meanings" of the recorded exchanges, although context-specific sounds have recently been described and illus- trated.9 More often than not, the spotlight falls upon the action of a receptor organ, as the dog's sense of smell. Or, signals of quite varied origin - produced, say, by discoloration of the body's cover or by a gross movement (such as the change in 8 Robert M.

A classification at the receptor stage seems to yield, on the whole, a much simpler and more useful frame- work, as illustrated, for example, by Peter Marler's comprehen- sive survey.10 "rjlHE MOST primitive communication undoubtedly takes X place by chemical means," Lindauer tells us (p. 2) ; yet, the chemical senses play an important role in the life of most animals, with the probable exception of birds. Lindauer con- siders chemical communication "primitive," because the pos- sibilities for modulation are highly restricted. It is true that the stag, for example, can broadcast two different scent signals: one, by marking the trail to keep the herd together; the other, by delimiting the boundaries of his territory to warn off rival males. But to accomplish the emission of two kinds of information, he must use two anatomically separated organs, the hoof glands and the eye glands. As almost anyone who has run over a skunk on a highway knows, a shocking message (ethanethiol) is abruptly produced but cannot be so rapidly turned off. In this very lack of flexibility, however, lies the one distinct advantage of chemical signals. By these means, an individual is capable of communicating with another in the future and, what is even more remarkable, an individual is also capable, by virtue of delayed feedback, of communicating with himself in the future. A spectacular illustration of the per- sistence in time of chemical signals is the retention by a salmon of odor impressions from youth to maturity (that is, over three to five years), enabling its return from the sea to its precise parent stream. Canine predators, among other mammals (bears, bisons, etc.), put urine very much to the same uses that we put another chemical, ink - a substance which, Hans Uldall once justly complained, "has not received the same attention on the part of linguists that they have so lavishly bestowed on the substance of air."11 Yet, the graphic manifestation of 10 "Developments in the Study of Animal Communication," Dar- win's Biological Work: Some Aspects Reconsidered , ed.

XXIV, NO. 1 language, script, no less than speech, has its functional ana- logue elsewhere in the animal kingdom, and, in particular, throughout the mammalian orders. The transmission of food - and, along with the nourish- ment, information vital to the colony - constitutes another elementary form of communication among bees. The social significance of the food exchange (trophallaxis) is threefold. First, the quality of the fare imparts information to the for- agers about the extent of the competition to which their terri- tory is subject (only the best food sources release the alerting dance) . Second, the water demand for temperature regulation is reported and finely attuned by this means, the extent of the need being accurately gauged by the delivery time. Third, since the food contains minute portions of a substance picked up by licking the queen's body, all bees in a hive are kept constantly aware of her presence or absence and react to her removal, in a matter of hours, by preparations to replace her. Having Lindauer briefly devotes disposed four of of the food five as chapters a symbol of Communi- conductor, Lindauer devotes four of the five chapters of Communi- cation Among Social Bees to communication by dancing. The olfactory sense, the sense of taste, the eye, the gravitational sense organs, and the time sense are all discussed, but he pays no attention in this book, even in passing, to the much dis- puted question whether honey bees can perceive sound waves, and, if so, whether information is transmitted by this means from one bee to another. Lindauer did prove, however, that humming in the stingless bee, Meliponini, has "something to do" with the collector's alerting other hive bees (p. 76). A few months ago, I had an opportunity to visit both the laboratory of Harald Esch, at the University of Munich, and of Adrian Wenner, at the University of California at Santa Barbara, to observe a series of new discoveries about bee com- munication.12 Very briefly, these appear to be as follows: The 15 See "Communication With Queen Honey Bees by Substrate Sound," Science , CXXXVIII (1962), 446-447; and "Sound Com- munication in Honey Bees," Scientific American, CCX (April 1964), 116-124. 66</page><page sequence="9">MARCH 1967 ASPECTS OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION tail-wagging dance carries no information unless accompanied by a whirring sound; it is a redundant gesture commonly known as an intention movement. The duration of the sound informs the worker bees about the distance of the nectar sup- ply. Thus, a whir of 0.4 seconds indicates 200 meters, of 8 seconds, 10,000 meters, and so forth. The higher the quality of the food-find, the more vehement the dancer's whir - whereby quality and distance are additionally coupled in an economic relationship. The sound is not a monologue, for the scout's drumming is followed by short, chirping beeps emitted by the watching workers, seemingly meaning: "message understood." When the scout senses the beep, she stops dancing, thus en- abling a worker to approach her and smell the odor of the nectar she has found. If she fails to stop, she is stung to death. Unlike a bird's nest, which is simply an incubator turned into a cradle, a beehive serves not only as a nursery, but also as the colony's meeting place, social center - in a word, home. It is therefore hardly surprising that the search for a dwelling of high quality looms as a problem for a bee community next only to the search for food. Yet, it became known only within the past decade that the dances of the bees play a decisive role in conveying information about shelter. Lindauer traces how the scout bees announce the location of suitable nesting places by means of the dance in the cluster; how, before moving, the swarm "agrees" upon one of the nesting places offered; how this "agreement" comes about; how the quality of a nesting place is evaluated; and which bees function as house hunters. The pragmatic import of the tail-wagging dance, we learn, de- pends not upon variation in the formal expression, but rather upon the attendant physical context of the same gesture pat- tern. Hockett has already pointed this out, but his observation needs one qualification: although the form of the dance is identical, there are significant differences in duration.18 The message, being a call of concern to the entire swarm, often lasts more than five minutes and may continue for an hour. Lindauer relates the history of one suspenseful "debate" which 13 "Logical Considerations in the Study of Animal Communication," op. cit., p. 410. 67</page><page sequence="10">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 1 lasted for five days, and the exceptional case of one aerial tug of war which ended, after a fortnight's dancing, without an agreement. The biological function of duration, under normal circumstances, is obvious: the longer the dance, the more bees can visit the chosen site and thereupon act as guides for the swarm. In the lifetime of a worker, a house-hunt is a very rare, perhaps unique, event, whereas there are many opportunities to communicate about sources of crops to be exploited for food. But, "Is a structural dialectology possible?" we may ask with Uriel Weinreich, extending his question to the domain of animal communication.14 A survey of recent developments in the experimental study of bird songs, at least, leaves no room for doubt that the answer will be affirmative. "It is well known," says William H. Thorpe, "that in many cases the song of the species can be sufficiently constant and distinct to serve as a specific recognition mark, but yet can vary within these limits sufficiently to indicate subspecific, racial, and local popu- lations."15 From a wealth of data, one might cite the chaffinch, where the effects of geographic boundaries have been shown to result in "true" dialect formation (that is, in local variations which are not based on genetic discontinuities). The dialect areas may range in size from an isolated glen in Scotland to a mosaic of very small pieces, delimited by a road or a railroad, and may exhibit differences both in inventory and in distribu- tion. Synchronic dialectology, Weinreich defines, "compares systems that are partially different and analyzes the 'synchronic consequences' of these differences within the similarities." This was the procedure followed in a series of engrossing experi- ments with wild crows. Crows in this country are known to exhibit distinctive alarm notes inducing other crows to dis- perse, distress calls when caught, and assembly calls emitted when they sight a bird of prey or a cat. These calls were tape- recorded and, when played to wild crows in an American wood- land, elicited much of the same reactions. When, however, these tape recordings were tested on crows in France, either there was no response or the French crows assembled where 14 Word, X (1954), 388-400. 15 Bird-Song (Cambridge, England, 1961), p. 99. 68</page><page sequence="11">MARCH 1967 ASPECTS OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION the Americans would have fled. Captive Pennsylvania crows respond "abnormally" to the calls of Maine crows and vice versa. But crows free to migrate between the two regions con- struct a diasystem which enables them to understand both local dialects.16 Since lects the has appearance received special of Lindauers attention book, from Von the topic Frisch of him- dia- lects has received special attention from Von Frisch him- self.17 Both treatments deal with what we might designate, still using Weinreich's terminology, diachronic dialectology, namely the phenomenon of divergence: "It studies the growth of partial differences at the expense of similarities and possibly reconstructs earlier stages of greater similarity." Observations carried out on six races - Italian, Austrian, German, Punic, Caucasian, and Egyptian - within the species Apis mellifera soon showed communicative variations in respect both to the area indicated, respectively by a round and a tail-wagging dance, and to the dancing rhythm. Thus, if the distance between the hive and the food source is 100 meters, the number of complete revolutions of the figure-eight-shaped dance per 15 seconds for each race was calculated, respectively, as 7.95, 8.4, 9, 9.05, 9.8 and 9.25. Given such minute geographic variations, one cannot help wondering whether bees would misunderstand each other if different races were placed together to make a mixed colony. Being members of the same species, an Austrian bee (A. mellifera comica) and an Italian bee ( A. mellifera ligustica) can interbreed. If put together in a colony, they work together in harmony, and the dance of one will arouse the other. Yet, they experience confusion whenever they at- tempt to communicate: "If, for example, an Austrian bee receives information from an Italian bee about a food place 100 meters from the nest, she will fly 120 meters, because she 16 Hubert Frings, et al., "Reactions of American and French Species of Corvus and Larus to Recorded Communication Signals Tested Re- ciprocally," Ecology, XXXIX (1958), 126-131; Hubert and Mabel Frings, "The Language of Crows," Scientific American , CCI (1959), 119-131. 17 "Dialects in the Language of Bees," Scientific American, CCVI1 (1962), 79-87. 69</page><page sequence="12">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 1 interprets the 'Italian dialect* in her Austrian way. And con- versely, the Italian bee will fly only 80 meters when given in- formation for 100 meters by an Austrian bee" (p. 61). The experiment reported by Lindauer is reminiscent of the "test the informant" method designed to measure the degree to which members of one speech community can understand the utterances of members of another, but a linguist is bound to envy the precision with which his apiarian colleague is able to record and represent the extent of variation. It is comforting to have access to informants, but in passing from dialectology to comparative linguistics, their lack or the absence of their written residue are hardly decisive handicaps. It has now been shown that phylogenetic research is equally feasible, among the bee's taxonomie relatives, in respect to the dance complex - a sophisticated behavior pattern which also leaves no paleontological record, as fossils of, say, termite nests, by way of petrified proof. In trying to track the dancing instinct backwards in time, one must start with descriptive statements of existing structures of communication in species of Apis other than mellifera. To accomplish this, Lindauer journeyed to the original home of our honey bee, the Indo-Malayan region, which is the habitat of all other known species of this genus: A. indica, , the giant A. dorsata, and the dwarf A . florea . In brief, what he found was this. All four species use essentially the same method of communication - by round dances and tail- wagging dances - as far as food provision and search for hous- ing sites are concerned. With respect to the indication of dis- tance (which is expressed in the rhythm of the tail-wagging dance), only minor differences appeared, although these were more pronounced than those among the strains within the spe- cies. With respect to the indication of direction, however, Lindauer did make one critical discovery, namely, that the dwarf bee is incapable of transposing light to gravity. That is to say, members of this species can dance only on a hori- zontal surface. Von Frisch characterizes theirs as "a clearly more primitive social organization and a correspondingly less highly developed language."18 18 Ibid., 83. 70</page><page sequence="13">MARCH 1967 ASPECTS OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION To regress still further on the evolutionary scale, Lindauer and his associates turned to the bees most closely related to the Apini , the stingless bees of the subfamily Meliponini. All eleven species so far investigated were found to "have a means of communication that enables them to alert other bees and to guide them to a specific goal" (p. 72), but their technique differs in many points from that of their relatives. The essential difference lies in the fact that Meliponini newcomers are not directed to their goal by information imparted exclusively in the hive (direction and distance information are not even in- corporated in their alerting system), but are also guided by trail marks and pilot bees beyond the hive. Although their solution may seem less elegant to us, it is just as successful as the honey bee's and, in at least one respect, superior: com- munication fails when honey bees are required to report a feed- ing place much above or below the hive, but not so in the stingless bees. As linguistic the linguist families cautiously toward probes wider historical from constructs reconstructions such as linguistic families toward wider historical reconstructions which some call, as Harry Hoijer puts it, "by an unfortunate biological metaphor," phyla and macrophyla, so the ethologist searches out traits common to all social insects and, beyond, to solitary species. Before leaving the bees for the dolphins, I should like to make two digressive observations, the first of them stimulated by Joseph Greenberg. In reviewing Hockett in connection with his treatment of bee communication, Greenberg, "as a human," insists that he "would like to winout over the bees by more than a technical knockout."19 He appears to mean that there is a single structural trait which distinguishes their system of communication from ours: "All human languages including written and other representations which permit one-to-one con- version on the sentence level are universal metalanguages and only human language has this property." If exchanged cues and 19 Joseph H.

XXIV, NO. 1 propositions about codification and relationship between the communicators is f metacommunication," then clear instances of such higher-order social interchanges can be found among many animals. The metacommunicative messages used by rhe- sus monkeys, enabling them to distinguish between play and nonplay, have received particularly careful attention,20 and a form of instinctive behavior in the honeybee has been recorded which surely falls into this category. When a worker leaves the hive for field duties, she carries a sample of her particular colony odor (which, as a result of the actual flow of wax, pollen, and nectar, presents a certain uniformity throughout the hive) locked in a special scent sac. Upon her return, im- mediately before landing, she opens her scent gland as though displaying a pass badge to the guard bees. The odor of a strange worker causes bellicose behavior, but bees with the matching home odor are admitted. When individual b19 of the colony C, sends a signal sx to individuals bn of C, this event can be represented by a simple formula: b1 &gt;sT &gt;bn In this situation, however, the signal consists of a special fragrance, Cf, which functions to insure that further communi- cation, advantageous to that particular C, can thereupon be initiated. The wrong stimulus may lead to an attack, followed by a scuffle, ending with the kill of the adversary. This signal is, therefore, metacommunicative, sm: &gt;sa &gt;bn &gt;sx &gt;ba My second observation relates to a hypothesis recently de- veloped in some detail elsewhere:21 that whereas subhuman species characteristically exchange messages that are coded in analogue fashion, in speech some information is coded thus and other information is coded digitally. As far as the bees 20 Stuart A. Altman, "Social Behavior of Anthropoid Primates: Analysis of Recent Concepts," Roots of Behavior, ed. Eugene L. Bliss (New York, 1962). 21 Thomas A. Sebeok, "Coding in the Evolution of Signalling Be- Ihavior," Behavioral Science, VII (1962), 430-442. 72</page><page sequence="15">MARCH 1967 ASPECTS OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION are concerned, it is clear that their behavior resembles that of an analogue computer, that is, a control machine of the more- or-less type, and not at all of a digital computer, of a yes-or- no type. Lindauer's book, supplemented by reports of other findings published elsewhere, makes it possible now to adjust and ex- pand somewhat the column on bee dancing in Hocketťs latest table (I960)22 of 13 design features. In that version, he had marked five slots positively: (2) broadcast, (4) interchange- ability, (7) semanticity, (10) displacement, and (11) produc- tivity. A "yes" should also be entered in row (5) for total feedback - since any dancer will cease to emit messages in the absence of an "audience" ; and in row (8) for arbitrarinesss - since the gesture can, after all, be decomposed into elements used to transmit specific portions of information. In addition, one should remember that the field of semantic reference com- prehends both food source and nesting site. In feature (1), Hockett combined the transmitter, the channel, and the receiver into one single category, "vocal-auditory"; but it would be much better to keep the three stages strictly apart: the auditory component in the total ribbon of bee communication, for ex- ample, invites separate inquiry. Further important features in- clude a transcoding potential, that is, an ability to convert directional vectors from a visual field (positive phototaxis) to a gravitational field (negative geotaxis) ; and finally, the ca- pacity for a restricted form of metacommunication. Aristotle, historian who in his alluded Historia to Animalium, the dancing was bees: the "On first reaching natural Aristotle, historian who alluded to the dancing bees: "On reaching the hive, they throw off their load [ aposetontai "they shake themselves"], and each bee on his return is accompanied by three or four companions."

Alpers.23 Then, in 1961, three book-length studies were published in the United States: one by Winthrop Kellogg24 and another by John Lilly,25 in addition to Alpers' skillful blend of fact and legend (not to mention Leo Szilard's clever satirical piece on the voice of the dolphins26) . The reports of Kellogg and of Lilly could thus be viewed as climaxing cen- turies of accumulated observations. On the other hand, they could also, and perhaps more aptly, be regarded as major if tentative opening moves in a new scientific game: marine bioacoustics. The existence of animal communication by sound (underwater creatures com- municate by other means too, of course: electric fish distort their own high-voltage fields; one member of the squid family squirts a radiant cloud to hide behind) in the "silent world" of the ocean depths came to the serious attention of the scientific community only within the last quarter of a century. "Roars, knocks, honks, squeals, 'popping of corks' - old sounds from new places"27 are now under intense investiga- tion in their natural environment by means of a hydrophone system; and the literature of the field has already reached stag- gering proportions. Although acoustical studies of captive cetaceans have concentrated for the most part on the bottlenose dolphin, the sonic activities of the pilot whale, the spotted porpoise, the harbor porpoise, the Atlantic saddleback dolphin, 28 Dolphins: The Myth and the Mammal (Cambridge, Mass., 1961). 24 Porpoises and Sonar (Chicago, 1961). 95 Man and Dolphin (Garden City, N.Y., 1961). 28 The Voice of the Dolphin and Other Stories (New York, 1961). 37 William N.

Kellogg' s research program is de- voted largely to the way in which porpoises navigate, and his book presents impressive evidence showing the workings of their sonar system - how they avoid obstacles while swimming at night or in turbid water, and how they locate fish for food. The author is a psychologist noted for his flair in conducting imaginative experiments with large-brained mammals. Thirty years ago, he and Mrs. Kellogg adopted a seven-month-old chimpanzee into their home, and compared her with their baby son.29 In the present instance, his work carries on a tradition embodied in Donald R. Griffin's masterpiece on acoustic orien- tation in bats, in certain nocturnal birds, and among blind men.80 In pleasant contrast with Lilly's perfervid prose, Kel- logg's exposition is lean; where the former relies heavily on rhetoric, the latter marshals data dispassionately in their logical array. Kellogg's first chapter positions the bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, in common usage also called a porpoise, in the taxonomie order of Cetacea, among the toothed whales or Odontoceti, and concludes with the description of a dramatic incident, foreshadowing the particularized substance of the rest of his book, in the course of which, by a lucky concatenation of circumstances, he successfully recorded the underwater noises made by a school of some twenty wild dolphins in their natural state. "Never before that time" he says, "and never since - have we been fortunate enough to capture such an auditory 28 Echo ranging in other sea mammals has also been discovered, as reported by T. C.

According to Kellogg, an accurate assessment of the dol- phin's order of intelligence, meaning its ability to learn from experience, "is not yet possible because of the dearth of experi- mental research on the subject" (p. 25) ; although Lilly pre- dicts, from an elaborate argument based chiefly on anatomical considerations, that Tur stop s will prove to be as intelligent as man (Appendix Two, pp. 255-294). The dolphin appears to differ from other mammals in one striking respect, namely, the extent to which its vocalization can be modified. In seeming contradiction to the assertions of Burrhus F. Skinner, that "Well-defined emotional and other innate responses comprise reflex systems which are difficult, if not impossible, to modify by operant reinforcement," and that "Vocal behavior below the human level is especially refractory,"31 dolphins can readily be trained to vocalize for a reward. Lilly goes much further and claims to have unique evidence for some degree of mimicking of human laughter, human or electronically produced whistles, "Bronx cheers" and similar noises, and words (pp. 201-202). However this may be, the zoologist R. J. Andrew has re- viewed the implications of these and other discussions of the acquisition of high intelligence and the ability of vocal mimick- ing in the broad perspective of human evolution, and has come to certain pertinent conclusions: that the intelligence of a dol- phin is of an order somewhere between that of a dog and that of a chimpanzee; that, in view of our vast ignorance of the causes of the evolution of the capability for sound mimicry in birds or man, "it would be foolish to assume that the ceta- ceans cannot mimic," but that such behavior is bound to be adaptive - involving, as we might say, a set of messages serving to establish, prolong, or discontinue contact, to check whether the network is in operating condition, or, to use Bronislaw Malinowski's terse phrase, phatic communion.32 One residual 81 Verbal Behavior (New York, 1957), p. 463. 82 R.

As Andrew states the point: If a primate is trying to solve a problem it does not vocalize (unless it is giving up and going into a tantrum) . If it is made to vocalize, then its attention is no longer on the problem, or on the reward that awaits its solution; that it will learn to use vocalization to obtain a reward is therefore most unlikely. Among baboons, "most communication between troop mem- bers is gestural and without vocal accompaniment/'33 George Schaller84 reports that gorillas co-ordinate the behavior within the group primarily by employing certain postures and gestures. ... It is probable that facial expressions emphasize and elaborate informa- tion communicated by other means. . . . Vocalizations notify the others of a specific emotional state of the per- former, alerting them to watch for gestures which com- municate further information, (p. 272) Howler monkeys, on the other hand, living in dense tropical forests, frequently rely on vocalizations in situations in which a semiterrestrial primate would use a visual signal. The dolphin, however, with its wide repertoire of sounds, vocalizes frequently and under various circumstances. We may tentatively explain the predominance of the acoustic channel in the human (and in the dolphin) - in contradistinction to the situation among the apes - in terms of an economic shift from a vegetarian to an omnivorous existence (requiring hunting) ; Robert Ascher and Hockett suppose that "the communicative behavior of the great apes may be somewhat more subtle and 83 Sherwood L.

He explains the significance of such noises and stresses their importance for man at peace (fishing) and at war. He shows how the propagation of sound in water differs from that in air. In the next chapter, he introduces the reader to the prin- ciple of so(und) n(avigation) a(nd) r(anging), and inquires whether water noises emitted by whales are suitable for use as echo-ranging signals. In the case of the dolphin, there is an obvious similarity with man's electronic radar, but there are two major differences: the frequency of emission of the dol- phin's pinging sound varies over a wide range, whereas that of human radar is usually constant ; and the intensity of the animal noises may also be markedly altered within a single burst of ranging signals. The nature of the signal itself forms the topic of the fifth chapter. The echoes which bounce back from objects that are in the animal's way, supplying information about distance and direction, can be seen and photographed on the screen of a cathode-ray oscilloscope, and the auditory pat- tern can be brought within the more limited perceptual range of the human ear and brain by reducing the play-back speed of the recording tape. The question of just how the dolphin produces sound sig- nals remains unresolved: the cetaceans have no vocal cords. The dolphin's whistling, incidentally, can be seen - in the shape of a stream of bubbles emerging from its blowhole - as well as heard, but whether or not this message is redundant cannot be "The Human Revolution," Current Anthropology, V (1964), 135-147. «8 "My Life Among Wild Chimpanzees," National Geographic , CXXIV (1963), 272-308. 78</page><page sequence="21">MARCH 1967 ASPECTS OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION answered pending further data on its visual acuity in water. The receptor organs are much better known. Accordingly, Kellogg details the dolphin's acoustic analyzer in his sixth chapter. The perception of submerged targets was studied, under controlled conditions, at the Marine Laboratories of Florida State University, as set forth in the seventh chapter. The dol- phin's auditory scanning is shown to consist of the emission of a continuous series of sound signals for echolocation plus bin- aural localization. How the stream of information produced by auditory scanning is instantly classified and associated with pre- viously stored impulses in the animal's brain is, again, beyond present knowledge. We can but speculate about its similarity to the mechanical counterpart of such a receptor system: a sonar apparatus with one transmitter and two independent re- ceivers, hooked up to an electronic computer capable of decod- ing and processing the input - all stored within a single compact unit. In addition, the dolphin's acoustic analyzer "per- forms a kind of frequency analysis for every echo which is received" (p. 123) ; that is, the animal can easily perceive dis- tinctions between separate objects of the same area but of dif- erent material. The eighth and ninth chapters demonstrate the predominance, if not exclusive involvement, of the auditory sense, after elimination of the visual, olfactory (the dolphin has none), gustatory, tactual, and thermal. The experiment de- signed to prove that the dolphin does not simply "follow its taste buds" (pp. 135-42) is particularly ingenious and con- clusively confirms that the acoustic modality is the sole sensory avenue employed by the dolphin to discriminate a blocked passageway from an open one. Attempts to jam the echo-rang- ing process by broadcasting back to the dolphins tape record- ings of their own sonar signals from an earlier session have failed. Evidently they are able to distinguish between genuine and recorded signals. In his concluding chapter, Kellogg emphasizes "that por- poise sonar is quite a different matter from carrying on a con- versation" (p. 157), because in speech the direct sound inten- sity is mudi greater than the echoes, whereas in sonar the echoes carry the relevant information and the task is to isolate 79</page><page sequence="22">ETC.: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS VOL. XXIV, NO. 1 one particular kind of echo from others which may be stronger or of different composition. The returning signal "denotes" - that is, implies the ability to interpret, evaluate, and identify - features of the environment, including distance, direction, speed, size, shape, and perhaps the texture of the object de- lineated by the echo. By his a curious book's half trick title, of repeated a typographer's on the title art, page beginning and there- with his book's half title, repeated on the title page and there- after in the running head of each even-numbered page, Lilly's anthropomorphic imagination is given physical force: "Man" is printed in roman type, "and Dolphin" contrastively in italics. His work is imbued with what John Ruskin called the "pa- thetic fallacy," the rhetorical device which humanizes animals or which, applied downward, projects man into the nonhuman world. The author himself is well aware of this (pp. 104 ff.), but his metaphoric intuition proves stronger than his scientific discipline (pp. 303 ff-) , and we find that, with due assistance from the mass media - Life magazine and the Jack Paar show - Lilly's dolphins have moved into the swim of contemporary American mythology. Like Blake's Tiger, Lilly's Dolphin is at once something less and something more than man, a visionary creature, symbol as well as thing. With this figure in a double narrative, on the level of science and on the level of myth, he has written a strange, irritating, anecdotal, and provoking boot His obsessive concern is with the interaction of the two species named in the title. His first sentence sets the tone: "Within the next decade or two the human species will establish com- munication with another species: nonhuman, alien, possibly extraterrestrial, more probably marine; but definitely highly intelligent, perhaps even intellectual" (p. 11). This leitmotiv recurs from the first chapter, "The Possibilities of Interspecies Communication," through the twelfth, "Implications." If the passages were shaped to shock, épater , as it were, le bourgeois, they will leave sober workers in the behavioral and life sciences unmoved: not because of the freshness of the confrontation, but because of the triviality of the data so far. Moreover, Lilly's "method of describing results has a high degree of subjectivity 80</page><page sequence="23">MARCH 1967 ASPECTS OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION to it. It can be inexact, and even completely mistaken" (p. 196), and the matter of mimicry thus stands, inconclusively, where Andrew left it. The following tragicomic episode, "The Voices of the Dolphin," is cited in full to convey something of the flavor of this book. Lilly ģis working with a dolphin named Lizzie: Someone suggested that I would be late for dinner if I didn't leave and said, "It's six o'clock!" very loudly. The tape recorded this on the air channel; in a few seconds on the underwater channel Lizzie, near the hydrophone, putt-putted, Baby [another dolphin] answered with a short fast series of whistles, and Lizzie very loudly came out with a "humanoid" sentence, the meaning of which (if any) has puzzled several of us since. It may have been a poor copy of "It's six o'clock." But I was caught first by another "meaning." It sounded to me like "This is a trick!" with a peculiar hissing accent. Other people have since heard the tape and come to the same conclusion. This was the last recording from Lizzie; we found her dead next morning. Our grief was painful and our mourn- ing long. It was a great disappointment to lose her just as she started to make sounds of this sort. (p. 203) Loren Eisley, in a rhapsodic reaction to Lilly's work, "The Long Loneliness - Man and the Porpoise: Two Solitary Des- tinies,"87 advances the notion that the dolphin's echo-ranging "instrument" is a finger surrogate, and he depicts "another kind of lonely, almost disembodied intelligence floating in the wavering green fairyland of the sea - an intelligence possibly near or comparable to our own but without hands to build, to transmit knowledge by writing, or to alter by one hairs- breadth the planet's surface" (p. 63).

XXIV, NO. 1 ongoing research projects, reveals that the study of signalling behavior in animals has, by and large, been taxonomically pa- rochial. Even Charles Darwin's great pioneer work, on The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (London, 1872), dealt, in the main, with the domestic cat and dog. A great variety of animals has since been more or less minutely scrutinized, both in the natural environment and in captiv- ity, but usually in one particular species (or, sometimes, in closely related forms, say, of the genus Apis) rather than guided by overarching theoretical considerations relevant to problems of communication in general, including especially speech. The task for the immediate future will be to treat, comprehensively and exhaustively, the achievements of zoo- semiotics from Darwin to the present day ; to arrange and dis- play the data in a format relevant to the study of language - that is, by matching logical concepts derived from sociobiology with those developed in linguistics; and, using each species, so to say, as a miniature paradigm which throws light upon language observed as a peculiar combination of distinctive fea- tures, of which all or almost all components, considered alone, have their separate evolutionary roots, to consolidate and build upon what has been established about the protocultural foun- dations of human adaptation. The conception of language as a social institution, unfolded in necessary antithesis to simple-minded Darwinism, is now it- self in need of revision as we recollect Leonard Bloomfielďs aphorism: "Language creates and exemplifies a twofold value of some human actions/'88 Language has, as he put it, both a biophysical and a biosocial aspect. Speech is, of course, a biolog- ical phenomenon in several related senses. Since all systems in science have a biological component, the linguistic system ob- served includes the linguist-observer. Speech, furthermore, is carried on by human beings, a species of animal. It is not only a part of animal behavior, but undoubtedly the principal means of biological adaptation for man, an evolutionary specialization that arose from prehuman behavioral adaptation of which we seek to trace the paths as one objective of zoosemiotics. 38 Linguistic Aspects of Science (Chicago, 1939)» P- 8. 82</page><page sequence="25">MARCH 1967 ASPECTS OF ANIMAL COMMUNICATION In 1936 Roman Jakobson asked, in Copenhagen, "Est-il besoin aujourd'hui de rappeler que la linguistique appartient aux sciences sociales et non à l'histoire naturelle? N'est-ce pas un truisme évident?" ("Is it necessary today to remember that linguistics belongs to the social sciences, and not to natural history? Isn't this an evident truism?")39 Twenty-five years later, he himself gave the answer as, in Helsinki, he called at- tention to the "direct homology between the logic of molecular and phonemic codes,"40 implying a vision of new and startling dimensions: the convergence of the science of genetics with the science of linguistics. A fundamental unity of viewpoint has been provided by the discovery that the problem of heredity lies, in effect, in the decipherment of a script, that genes are sections of the molecular chains of DNA which contain mes- sages coded in particular sequences of nucleotide bases, in a manner persuasively reminiscent of the way in which bundles of binary features are linked into sequences of phonemes. Ge- netics and linguistics thus emerge as autonomous yet sister dis- ciplines in the larger field of communication sciences, to which, on the molar level, zoosemiotics also contributes. 39 Selected Writings , I (The Hague, 1962), 234. 40 "Concluding Remarks," Proceedings of the Fourth International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, ed.
