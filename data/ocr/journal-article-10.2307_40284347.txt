<plain_text><page sequence="1">Samuel Demands the Muse: Johnson's Stamp on Imaginative Literature BY JEFFREY MEYERS T Xhe impact of Samuel Johnson on later writers derives from the ex- traordinary way in which his works are inextricably connected to his personality. He himself is one of the great characters in literature; his opinions and conversation were recorded in intimate detail in letters, journals, and memoirs and in Boswell's great biography. His work, therefore, has always been interpreted in the rich social context of his life. Though deeply serious, he brought a sense of humor and sharp wit to illuminate his great subjects: the powerful claims of the indi- vidual conscience, the moral struggle inherent in life, the suffering in human existence, the sense of his own imperfections, the pain of reli- gious doubt. His moral and literary influence in the nineteenth century extends to writers as different as Jane Austen, whose social comedies depend on an underlying Johnsonian moral framework; Nathaniel Hawthorne, for whom Johnson embodied the tormented Puritan con- science; and A. E. Housman, who echoed Johnson's stoicism in his verse. In the twentieth century Johnson remained a key character and thinker. For Virginia Woolf, who used him in her novel Orlando, he was the noble archetype of the man of letters. Samuel Beckett, ob- sessed for years with his pessimism, wrote a play about him. Jane Austen was devoted both to the character and writing of "My</page><page sequence="2">40 The Antioch Review dear Dr. Johnson," whose works were frequently and appreciatively read in her home. Her family valued Johnson's orthodox Toryism, his Anglicanism, piety, and moral rectitude. He emphasized not the formal tenets of religion, but the individual's striving for goodness and hu- mility. Austen's intellectual world view was permeated with Johnson. In N onhanger Abbey (1818), Austen gently satirized the way people deferred to Johnson's judgments. Eleanor Tilney, advising Catherine Morland about how to please her brother Henry (Catherine's future husband), warns her that Henry will invoke Johnson's Dictionary as the absolute authority on diction: "The word 'nicest' as you used it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or we shall be overpowered with Johnson ... all the rest of the way." Austen also imitated the master, whose style she wittily adapted to the novel. In Rambler 115 (1751) Johnson's young narrator says, "I was known to possess a fortune, and to want a wife." Austen's most celebrated sentence, the opening of Pride and Prejudice (1813), is an elaboration, in Johnsonian style, of this line: "It is a truth universally acknowl- edged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." Johnson's essays were full of epigrams and wise pro- nouncements that Austen put into the mouths of her characters. John- son observed that all self-censure was oblique commendation: "this affectation of candour or modesty was but another kind of indirect self-praise, and had its foundation in vanity." In this novel the hero, Mr. Darcy, a rather pompous young man who talks in a deliberately Johnsonian manner, expresses that same belief to Elizabeth Bennet: "Nothing is more deceitful . . . than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast." In Mansfield Park (1814) Johnson is both a moral touchstone and source of wit. Edmund Bertram, the serious clergyman who's en- dowed with Johnson's common sense and moral concerns, offers his cousin Fanny Price, the solemn heroine, copies of "Crabbe's Tales, and the Idler." Later in the novel, when Fanny returns to her squalid home, Jane Austen writes that she "was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson's celebrated judgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield Park might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures." Fanny refers to chapter 26 of Rasselas in which the widower Johnson, inspired by St. Paul's "It is better to marry than to burn" (I Corinthians 7:9), stated that "Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures." Robert Scholes has argued that Jane Austen adopted the moral philosophy of the Rambler and Rasselas.</page><page sequence="3">Samuel Demands the Muse 41 She agreed with Johnson's ideas about the "relationship of manners and morals, and assumptions about the nature of love and the quali- ties which make for a happy marriage. . . . The closeness- almost unity -of thought and attitude which exists between Jane Austen and Johnson on important matters ... is certainly striking." For Nathaniel Hawthorne, the relationship of manners and morals was not as clear cut, and his puritan sensibility drew him to Johnson's melancholy and anguished conscience. Again and again Hawthorne returned to the central act of contrition in Johnson's life, to the poi- gnant penance for his youthful act of filial disobedience- the primal sin evoked in the opening line of Paradise Lost. In his early seventies, he went to a town about twenty miles north of his native Lichfield: Once, indeed ... I was disobedient; I refused to attend my father to Uttoxeter-market. Pride was the source of that refusal, and the remembrance of it was painful. A few years ago, I desired to atone for this fault; I went to Uttoxeter in very bad weather, and stood for a considerable time bareheaded in the rain, on the spot where my father's [book] stall used to stand. In contrition I stood, and I hope the penance was expia- tory. In this superb evocation of scene and mood Boswell portrayed John- son as a latter-day St. Simeon Stylites, standing bareheaded in wet weather on the guilty spot that he still remembered fifty years later. As the astonished townsmen glance at the trembling madman and hurry home out of the rain, he still wonders if finally- through contrition and penance- he has achieved absolution. Hawthorne dwelt on the episode in two essays and used the public exemplum in his fictional masterpiece, The Scarlet Letter. His chapter on Johnson in his didactic Biographical Stories for Children (1842) concentrated on the apparently trivial but irreverent act early in life that gnawed at Johnson's conscience. He embellished the incident by inventing Michael Johnson's response, and used it to teach American children to obey their parents and remain contrite before God: "But all his fame could not extinguish the bitter remembrance which had tor- mented him throughout life. Never, never had he forgotten his father's sorrowful and upbraiding look By thus expressing his deep repen- tance and humiliation of heart, he hoped to gain peace of conscience and the forgiveness of God." After Hawthorne's Bowdoin College friend, Franklin Pierce, had been elected president, he was appointed American Consul in Liver- pool and in 1855 sedulously followed Johnson's footsteps in London, Lichfield, and Uttoxeter. In his 1863 essay on the Midlands towns, he</page><page sequence="4">42 The Antioch Review confessed that, apart from Johnson's poems, he preferred the man to the writer. He identified himself, in contrast to the down-to-earth John- son, as the creator of a more ethereal literature: "considering that my native propensities were towards Fairy Land ... I do not remember, indeed, ever caring much about any of the stalwart Doctor's grandilo- quent productions, except his two stern and masculine poems, 'Lon- don' and The Vanity of Human Wishes'; it was as a man, a talker, and a humorist, that I knew and loved him." Hawthorne then focused on the aged Johnson in Uttoxeter. He'd always been deeply impressed by that extraordinary incident, which he felt had atoned for a fundamen- tal error in Johnson's early life: "He stands bareheaded, a venerable figure, and a countenance extremely sad and woe-begone, with the wind and rain driving hard against him ... to lighten his half-century's burden of remorse." Finally, Hawthorne made brilliant use of the Uttoxeter episode in The Scarlet Letter (1850). The Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale (whose name means shadowy valley) seduces the married Hester Prynne (whose first name may have been borrowed from Johnson's last love, Hester Thrale). Nobly keeping her guilty secret, Hester refuses to re- veal the identity of the father of her illegitimate child. As punishment for her sin, she's forced to stand in the pillory and to wear the scarlet A that brands her as an adulteress, while Dimmesdale remains silent. In two crucial scenes, separated by many tormented years, Dim- mesdale mounts to the very place where Hester once stood. The emo- tional power of these scenes is strengthened by the tacit allusion to Johnson: Mr. Dimmesdale reached the spot where, now so long since, Hester Prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy. . . . Why, then, had he come hither? Was it but the mockery of penitence? . . . Had he been driven hither by the impulse of that Remorse which dogged him everywhere ... the agony of heaven-defying guilt and vain repentance And thus, while standing on the scaffold, in this vain show of ex- piation, Mr. Dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind, as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast. During the first scene it is midnight; the whole town is asleep and there is no danger of discovery. In the second scene, seven years later, Dimmesdale- after preaching a brilliant sermon on sin, anguish and repentance- is ineluctably drawn to the very same scaffold in the mar- ket place and makes his long-sought and long-repressed confession: "ye, that have loved me!- ye, that have deemed me holy!- behold me here, the one sinner of the world! At last!- at last!- I stand upon</page><page sequence="5">Samuel Demands the Muse 43 the spot where, seven years since, I should have stood; here, with this woman, whose arm, more than the little strength wherewith I have crept hitherward, sustains me, at this dreadful moment, from grovel- ling down upon my face." In Boswell's account Johnson remained silent as he struggled in a solemn and dignified manner with his own tormented conscience. Dimmesdale, whose sin is more grievous, must publicly proclaim his intolerable guilt. His speech is filled with ex- clamation marks, rhetorical repetitions, awkward style ("wherewith I have crept hitherward") and operatic threats to grovel on the ground. The episode that captured Hawthorne's imagination revealed the es- sential reason for Johnson's torment: the lack of conviction that he could in fact be forgiven, and the religious doubt that frequently drove him to melancholy and the fear of madness. Hawthorne the novelist understood the dramatic tension in the Protestant ethic: the constant striving to do good and the dread of eternal damnation. A. E. Housman, classicist and poet, was influenced by an altogeth- er different aspect of Johnson. He attacked Johnson's critical judg- ments of Milton, Pope, and William Collins in The Name and Nature of Poetry (1933), but imitated some of Johnson's poetry in his own verse. In his "Lines on Thomas Warton's Poems," Johnson ironically claimed that alcohol could alleviate the pains and evils of the world: Smite thy bosom, sage, and tell, Where is bliss? And which the way? . . . When the smiling sage reply 'd- Come, my lad, and drink some beer. Addressing his own likely lad in similar quatrains but in a more seri- ous mood, Housman repeats Johnson's last six words: The troubles of our proud and angry dust Are from eternity, and shall not fail. Bear them we can, and if we can we must. Shoulder the sky, my lad, and drink your ale. In a similar fashion, the morbid melancholy and tragic view of life in Johnson's last poem, a translation of Horace's Odes (IV.vii)- "But wretched Man, when once he lies / Where Priam and his sons are laid / Is nought but Ashes and a Shade,"- is repeated by Housman, a great Latin scholar, in "For My Funeral": We now to peace and darkness And earth and thee restore Thy creature that thou madest And wilt cast forth no more.</page><page sequence="6">44 The Antioch Review In "The Vanity of Human Wishes" Johnson wrote, with charac- teristic gloom: "Yet hope not Life from Grief or Danger free, / Nor think the Doom of Man revers'd for thee." In A Shropshire Lad Hous- man expressed an equally grim view of human misery: "Ay, look: high heaven and earth ail from the prime foundation; / All thought to rive the heart are here and all are vain." Both men were also profoundly conservative. Johnson believed "the change of old establishments is always an evil." Housman agreed with him and stated, "I am a conservative, and do not like changing anything without due reason." Norman Page has noted that Housman, like Johnson, had a taste for invective and was a master of the cruel condemnation and knock- out blow. Johnson, often vehement and vociferous, denounced the adulterous aristocrat Diana Beauclerk by asserting, "The woman's a whore, and there's an end on't." Housman, when confronted with a palpably inept editor, exclaimed, "Mr. Merrill has special disqualifi- cations for editing a poet." Page added that Housman "is fond of the Johnsonian trick of ridicule by reductive metaphor or analogy: of the notes of the hapless Merrill's edition of Catullus, he declares that 'half the ship's cargo has been thrown overboard to save the bilge- water.'" Johnson, ever the great example of the independent scholar and man of letters, inspired in Housman a vein of caustic wit and devotion to scholarship. Virginia Woolf was also a great admirer of Johnson. She was strongly influenced by her father, Leslie Stephen, who wrote exten- sively about Johnson, and popularized his biographical method, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Woolf collected her essays on Johnson's friends- Boswell, Charles Burney, and Giuseppe Baretti- but published only one obscure, anonymous review about Johnson. In "Saint Samuel of Fleet Street" (1925), the sharp-tongued, hypercriti- cal Woolf praised his impressive character and, echoing "such stuff / As dreams are made on" from The Tempest, remarked: "There can be no doubt . . . that Dr. Johnson has proved himself of the stuff that Saints are made of. ... He is one of the very few human beings who love their kind." Woolf begins The Common Reader (also 1925) by claiming that she wrote with the same sound intentions and for the same receptive audience as Johnson, and quotes the memorable final paragraph of The Lives of the Poets: There is a sentence in Dr. Johnson's Life of Gray which might well be written up in</page><page sequence="7">Samuel Demands the Muse 45 all those rooms, too humble to be called libraries, yet full of books, where the pursuit of reading is carried on by private people. "... I rejoice to concur with the common reader; for by the common sense of readers, uncorrupted by [Johnson wrote "with"] literary prejudices, after all the refinements of subtilty and the dogmatism of learn- ing, must be finally decided all claim to poetical honours." It defines their qualities; it dignifies their aims. . . . Three years later, in Orlando: A Biography, her protean heroine turns up in eighteenth-century England and observes several members of Johnson's household (including his blind dependent, Anna Wil- liams) illuminated through a screen. Woolf s striking scene portrays some of his most famous idiosyncrasies: his spasmodic movements, his insatiable appetite for tea, and his grandiloquent conversation. It also alludes to a shadowy passage in the Life of Savage in which Sav- age, after discovering the identity of his real mother, would "walk in the dark evenings for several hours before her door, in hopes of seeing her as she might come by accident to the window or cross her apart- ment with a candle in her hand." ... she stood half an hour watching three shadows on the blind drinking tea together in a house in Bolt Court. . . . [T]here was the Roman-looking rolling shadow in the big armchair- he who twisted his fingers so oddly and jerked his head from side to side and swallowed down the tea in such vast gulps. Dr. Johnson, Mr. Bos well, and Mrs. Williams, those were the shadows' names [T]he great rolling shadow, who now rose to its full height and rocking somewhat as he stood there rolled out the most magnificent phrases that ever left human lips. . . . A critic has recently pointed out that in an unpublished version of Woolf 's The Waves (1931) Bernard, the disappointed writer, connects Percival, who dies in his mid-twenties in India, to Johnson's greatest and most pessimistic poem: "In the second draft, Bernard pictures Per- cival in India, reading (appropriately) Johnson's poem on The Van- ity of Human Wishes' 'with his legs over the arm of a camp chair,' soon after [T.S.] Eliot had sent the Woolfs his [1930] edition of that poem." Woolfs use of Johnson was intellectual and aesthetic; Samuel Beckett's was intensely personal and emotional. He was born a hun- dred years ago, in 1906, and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1969. Like Hawthorne, he strongly identified with the historical figure of Samuel Johnson (his namesake), and made a pilgrimage to Lichfield. But Beckett used Johnson's religious doubt, his melancholy and fits of insanity to emphasize his own sense of futility. Johnson once said: "If ... I had no duties, and no reference to futurity, I would spend my life in driving briskly in a post-chaise with a pretty woman." Beckett</page><page sequence="8">46 The Antioch Review twisted this famous comment to suit his own temperament. Leaving out the pretty girl and making the journey pointless rather than pleas- ant, he mentioned "Johnson's dream of happiness, driving happily to and fro nowhere." Like Johnson, Beckett often sank into torpor and spent half the day in bed. In 1937 Beckett planned to write a play about Johnson and read many books by and about him in the library of Trinity College, Dub- lin. His three manuscript notebooks, now in the Reading University Library, emphasize Johnson's dark side. His principal source was Johnson's Prayers and Meditations (1785 and many later editions), which revealed his morbid "obsession with mental and physical dete- rioration," with "melancholy, madness and death." Beckett's biogra- pher Deirdre Bair, who discussed the unfinished play with him, wrote that Beckett and Johnson, whom he called a tragic, "spiritually self- conscious" figure who needed to suffer, had a great many personal and literary qualities in common: He finds much that appeals to him, particularly the melancholy moods and depres- sions which characterized Johnson's later life. [Beckett said] "it's Johnson, always Johnson, who is with me. And if I follow any tradition, it is his." Johnson's life as well his work has appealed to Beckett. Johnson had psychological problems of his own, and like Beckett, he was a late bloomer. Beckett may have identified his physical af- flictions with Johnson's- i.e., his boils, with Johnson's scrofula. Most importantly, in both men there is a love of theory and abstraction, and an incredible erudition, leading at times to an astonishing similarity of style. Beckett's drama, famous for its pared-down, elliptical style, seems quite different from Johnson's. But Beckett, like Jane Austen, was fas- cinated by Johnson's Dictionary. He, too, favored Latinate roots and philosophic diction, and used many polysyllabic words in works like More Pricks Than Kicks (1934) and Murphy (1938). He also quoted Johnson in Watt (1953) and, after a series of repetitions, wrote, "and so on, until all trace is lost, on account of the vanity of human wish- es." Beckett's devotion to Johnson lasted throughout his life. Anthony Cronin reported that in his small Parisian writing room in the 1960s, "on the specially built shelves stood those books which he wanted to have near him when he was working. There were his own works and those of James Joyce [and] various early editions of the works of Samuel Johnson." Beckett had the same pessimistic world view as Johnson, but was not sustained, even precariously, by his religious faith. Johnson's as- sertion in chapter 1 1 of Rasselas that in human life there is "much to</page><page sequence="9">Samuel Demands the Muse 47 be endured, and little to be enjoyed," is very close to Beckett's bleak outlook. Recent critics, noting their similarities, observed that Beckett "wrote so frequently and eloquently about that chasm between desire and fulfillment, expectation and realisation, hope and despair, which is the mark of Johnson in his periodical essays, in Rasselas and in Vanity" The last chapter of Rasselas, "The conclusion, in which noth- ing is concluded," appealed to Beckett's nihilism. Beckett, who called Rasselas "a grand book," also described what Johnson expressed in his private diaries but repressed in his published work and emphasized "the horror of annihilation, the horror of madness, the horrified love of Mrs. Thrale, and the whole mental monster ridden swamp." Bair added that "Beckett's original idea was to write a play in four acts, called Human Wishes, after Johnson's poem. ... He intended to explain Johnson's esteem for 'the imbecile Mr. Thrale' by concentrat- ing on Mrs. Thrale's relationship to the mature Johnson, and his obses- sive, unspoken love for her." Beckett told a friend, "It seems now quite certain that he was rather absurdly in love with her all the fifteen years he was at Streatham, though there is no text[ual authority] for the im- potence." Nevertheless, he was obsessed with Johnson's supposed im- potence and described it as "the fake rage to cover his retreat from her, then the real rage when he realizes that no retreat was necessary, and beneath both the despair of the lover with nothing to love with." In a stroke of brilliant casting, he thought the married homosexual Charles Laughton could act Johnson in this play. Beckett planned to begin the play with Henry Thrale's funeral in 1781, which left Hester free to remarry, and to end it with Johnson's death three years later. The opening scene in Johnson's bizarre house- hold (which also fascinated Virginia Woolf) would provide a contrast to his luxurious life with the Thrales at Streatham. But Beckett re- mained uncertain about whether to focus on Johnson's unreciprocated love for Hester or on the pathetic inmates of his radically discontented household: the blind poet Anna Williams, the sickly Elizabeth Des- moulins (who'd once been fondled in bed by Johnson), the former prostitute Poll Carmichael, and the unlicensed, impoverished Dr. Le- vett. As Johnson lamented to Hester: "Williams hates every body; Le- vett hates Desmoulins, and does not love Williams; Desmoulins hates them both; Poll loves none of them." Beckett's ten-page fragment begins in Bolt Court on April 4, 1781 with the three hostile women on stage. Hodge, Johnson's beloved black cat, is asleep. The drunken Levett appears, belches loudly, and</page><page sequence="10">48 The Antioch Review leaves without saying a word. Johnson does not appear at all. There's no dramatic action, merely a few petulant women engaged in vitupera- tive and slightly amusing dialogue. Desmoulins, for example, speaks Johnson's words about Hodge without providing either a meaning- ful context or the delightful anthropomorphic phrase "out of counte- nance." Boswell reported that as he watched Johnson stroke Hodge and said that he was a fine cat, Johnson replied: "'why yes, Sir, but I have had cats whom I liked better than this'; and then as if perceiving Hodge to be out of countenance, adding, 'but he is a very fine cat, a very fine cat indeed.'" Beckett writes, in staccato style: Desmoulins: Hodge is a very fine cat, a very fine cat indeed. . . . For his age, an uncommonly fine cat in all respects. ... Williams: I may be old, I may be blind, halt and maim, I may be dying of a pituitous defluxion [common cold], but my hearing is unimpaired. . . . You say you are not merry. Very well. But who is merry in this house? You would not call me merry, Madam, I suppose? . . . Nobody in this house is merry. Desmoulins: I hope you are satisfied, Madam. The ladies are anxiously waiting for Johnson and eager for news about Thrale's funeral. They imitate his Latinate diction- "peevish- ness of decay," "recumbent scurrility," "hilarity of ebriety"- and Mrs. Desmoulins quotes Hamlet: "that undiscovered country from whose [bourn / No traveler returns]." Poll quotes the theme of the dramatic fragment, "Death meets us everywhere," and gives examples from one of Johnson's favorite books, Jeremy Taylor's Holy Living and Holy Dying (1650-51). The decrepit old ladies reflect Johnson's own poor health and obsession with death. The dialogue is ironic, since pros- titute Poll, even if encouraged by Johnson to consult this text on the day of Thrale's funeral, would neither have read nor understood this difficult book. The ladies also discuss three Irish playwrights- Arthur Murphy, Hugh Kelly, and Oliver Goldsmith- and mention that the last two died in 1774. When Mrs. Desmoulins states that Goldsmith's "debt to na- ture is discharged," Mrs. Williams regrets that he died before repaying his debt to her. Mrs. Desmoulins, contentious as always, rejects Mrs. Williams' statement that Kelly is "dead and damned these last five [sic] years," by asserting: "Mr. Kelly may be poorly, but he is alive." Beckett seems to have misconceived the style as well as the setting and themes of the play. He misleadingly claimed that he abandoned the fragment because he was incapable "of putting it into the Irish</page><page sequence="11">Samuel Demands the Muse 49 accent as well as the proper language of the period. It would not do to have Johnson speaking proper language, after the manner of Boswell, while all the other characters speak only the impossible jargon I put into their mouths." But there was a more compelling reason for giv- ing it up. Another critic noted that "the more of Johnson he recorded in these notebooks, the more preposterous was the amatory scenario that initially impelled his interest." Yet the play was not a total loss. The fragment helped Beckett transform Johnson's pessimism into his characteristically bleak, beckettian view of the world. Beckett didn't mention Human Wishes to his official bibliogra- pher, grew impatient when Bair tried to discuss it with him, brusque- ly refused to let his American director read it, and finally gave the manuscript away to a scholar, saying "he was glad to be rid of it." He hated the play, which was not only a failure, but also reflected his own sexual impotence, which he projected onto Johnson. Cronin reported that Beckett, like his Johnson, though not completely impotent, "had difficulty copulating with the women for whom he had real feeling." Though Johnson's work seemed to go out of fashion soon after his death, his personality lived on. His strong, vivid character could not be directly transformed into fiction, but was most effective as an unseen presence in The Scarlet Letter or a shadowy figure in Orlando. His au- thority as a moralist and humanist pervades the work of Jane Austen, A. E. Housman, and Samuel Beckett. In Lives of the Poets Johnson emphasized the dignity and worth of the man of letters, whose values he exemplified. He wrote that "the stream of time, which is continu- ally washing the dissoluble fabricks of other poets, passes without injury by the adamant of Shakespeare." For two centuries after his death, Johnson has also remained an enduring presence in the work of imaginative writers.</page></plain_text>
