Ð Luce Irigaray, This Sex Which Is Not One2 </page> <page sequence="2"> 112 ❙ Wendy Zierler S ince biblical times, male Hebrew prophets and poets have depicted thephysical and spiritual contours of the land and cities of Israel, and byextension, the nation itself, by means of female personi®cations. In her study of biblical transformations of pagan myth, In the Wake of the Goddesses (1992), Tikva Frymer-Kensky o2ers a multifaceted catalog of these female ®gurations of Zion and the Land of Israel: mother, bride, good wife, bad wife, abandoned wife, maiden, daughter, the female ``persona immanent in the city,'' lamenting its destruction and celebrating its rejuvenation, the beloved of ` `both Israel and God,'' who ` `brings them closer together in shared love.''3 Common to all these female personi®cations, with their heterosexual love plots or their assumptions of female fragility and vul- nerability, is their origin in the male imagination. As Frymer-Kensky explains, ``Zion is a focus of intense passion and longing for the men of Israel. . . . They can express their love directly to this female ®gure in a way that they cannot have toward the remote, invisible, and masculine God.''4 This masculine tradition of female personi®cations of Zion and the Land of Israel does not end, of course, with the male biblical prophets, but continues and develops in the gaonic and medieval periods with poets such as Eleazar Ben Kallir (``Em habanim''), Yehuda Halevi (``Tsiyon, halo tish¥ali''), and Shalem Shabazi (``Ahavat hadassah''). The modern Zionist (male) poets carry on this practice as well, borrowing from tradition or composing their own new female metaphors for the Land of Israel and Jerusalem: a bereaved mother waiting for the return of her sons, a solitary queen,5 a captive daughter or maiden,6 or, as in the poetry of Avraham Shlonsky, where the hills and ®elds of Jezreel are compared to a herd of ``young she-camels'' clinging to the ``breasts'' of the Gilboa Mountains, the ``milk of rivers  ̄owing over the banks.''7 I quote Shlonsky here in particular because of the way his Erets Israel poetry clearly illustrates the masculine prerogative of this long-standing poetic tradition. Shlonsky's poetic persona, like that of William Wordsworth or Walt Whitman, cavorts about in nature, drawing personal inspiration and spiritual nourishment from the feminized landscape. Female ®gures are present in this poetry primarily to serve and nurture the male poet's mission and gratify his desires. In the fourth poem of his cycle ¦Amal, for example, a ``good mother'' ®gure dresses and adorns her son Abraham in a coat of many colors (reminiscent of the preferential treatment granted to the biblical Joseph), so that he, the son, may embark on his chosen holy work as a </page> <page sequence="3"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 113 ``poet-road builder'' in Israel.8 In other similar poems, an open-shirted,9 hairy- chested10 male poet is tickled by and nursed from the breast of the land (``behold your milk will  ̄ow / and my bones will drink the nectar of Genesis'').11 In these passages, the male poet is the creative center of the universe, and all feminine natural forces minister to him. In other passages, it becomes insu3cient for him to draw sustenance and service from the motherland; as a poet, he wants to share, even appropriate, her creative, nourishing powers. Shlonsky's poetic speaker longs to be a partner with her and with female fertility, as in the following excerpts from Yizre¦el (Jezreel) and Adamah (earth or land) where he likens his poetry with breast milk, and his poetic creativity with the fertility of land and woman: Behold here, my udders have also ®lled with milk, The udders of man (Adam) And my  ̄eshÐa breast  ̄ooding all, rising from the land.12 Adamah! Behold I battled with Elohim And was Adam (man) IÐthe Flesh And youÐAdamah (earth) And who is likened to us, knowers of birth.13 The wordplay employed in the Adamah excerpt evidently derives from the second account of Creation (Gen. 2:7),14 where God creates Adam from the dust of adamah. Shlonsky's speaker consciously alludes to this Creation account because he wishes to displace woman-Eve as primary birth giverÐshe is the one ``knower of birth'' excluded from this poemÐand establish the male poet-Adam as closest kin to the procreativity of the earth and land. Despite the seeming honor accorded here to feminine fecundity, the result of Shlonsky's appropriation of female procreativity is that the masculine poet is brought to an even higher level of creative power, while woman-Eve remains below, ``®xed in an intermediate position lower on the scale of transcendence than poet man.''15 Underlying this analogy between ``babies and </page> <page sequence="4"> 114 ❙ Wendy Zierler books,'' as Susan Stanford Friedman notes in her essay ``Creativity and the Childbirth Metaphor,'' is a simultaneous con ̄ation and separation of procreativity and literary creativity, of reproduction and production.16 As Friedman explains, at work here is the familiar Western patriarchal dualism (as seen above in the ®rst epigraph to this essay, taken from HeÂleÁne Cixous's ``Sorties''), which typically opposes mind and body, culture and nature, man and woman.17 In the Adamah excerpt, Shlonsky likens man-Adam to the fecund, feminine land only after claiming to have done battle with his peer, the ultimate (masculine) creator, Elohim. The absence of woman-Eve from Shlonsky's list of creative peers rehearses the familiar opposition between the pregnant female body and the pregnant male mind. What happens, when, at long last, women poets begin to claim a place within this tradition of femininely personifying Zion and the Land of Israel? What does it mean for a woman poet to include herself in a masculine poetic practice that presupposes a male poetic voice addressing a (usually passive) female object of desire or re ̄ection? What does it mean to enter into a tradition that depicts (or ventriloquizes through) symbolic feminine ®gures but o2ers next to no examples of actual women speakers/poets? On the one hand, the tradition of feminizing Erets Israel o2ers a means for the Zionist woman poet to forge a kind of poetic intimacy and solidarity with her homeland. On the other hand, the masculine nature of this poetic tradition, together with the analogy drawn in Jewish legal texts between the passivity and quiescence of land/earth and the sexual/social passivity of woman, prevents a straightforward acceptance of the metaphor. In tractate Qidushin of the Babylonian Talmud, for example, the laws governing the sale of a ®eld are compared to those governing a man's acquisition of a wife.18 Indeed, the land-as-woman metaphor was so accepted by the Rabbis that in B.T. Sanhedrin, they conclude that the biblical Esther did not commit an illicit sexual act when she copulated with the Persian king Ahasuerus (even though he was a Gentile, and, according to some opinions, she was already married), for she was like karka ¦olam (natural soil),19 acted upon, tilled, and sown. Although this statement was pronounced within the speci®c context of those sins that a Jew must be prepared to die over rather than commit in public, the statement isha karka ¦olam hava (``a woman is merely natural soil'') came to have the status of normative truth. Thus, centuries later, in a review of Yokheved Bat-Miriam's ®rst book, Mera¶ok, modern Hebrew literary critic Pin¶as La¶over </page> <page sequence="5"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 115 was able to argue that women are not usually skilled at abstraction; ``nature more than spirit,'' they typically function as the `` karka ¦olam  [natural soil] of everyday life.''20 How, then, do women writers ®nd their place in this tradition? What poetic ``ways out''Ðin HeÂleÁne Cixous's termsÐdo they ®nd to subvert these disenabling oppositions?21 In this essay, I will endeavor to answer these questions through an examination of the Land of Israel poetry of Yokheved Bat-Miriam (1901±80), in particular her magni®cent poem cycle Erets Yisra¥el (1937). To be sure, Bat-Miriam was not the only Hebrew woman poet to embrace the previously masculine habit of feminizing or maternalizing the land. The poets Ra¶el (1890±1931) and Esther Raab (1894±1981) each composed her own version of the land-as-woman metaphor.22 Of all these early woman poets, however, Bat-Miriam wrote the most mystical and elusive poetry about Erets Israel. And although Erets Yisra¥el is one of her best-loved worksÐin an admiring essay about Bat-Miriam's poetry, Natan Alterman writes that upon reading certain lines in Erets Yisra¥el, all other previous poetic lines about the land are momentarily silenced23 Ðthe cycle remains relatively underread and underexplicated. In fact, it has become something of a commonplace in the available critical literature about Bat-Miriam that in comparison with that granted to her contempo- raries, her poetry has not generally received the critical attention that it deserves.24 Various reasons have been adduced for this scarcity of critical attention, chief of which is the highly complex, hermetic quality of her work. Recently, under the in ̄uence of feminist theory and gender studies, there has been some revived interest in Bat-Miriam's work,25 although there is still much to be said. Ruth Kartun-Blum's Bamer¶ak hane¦elam (1977), the only published book-length monograph on Bat- Miriam's poetry to date, while an invaluable resource on the various themes, symbolism, and technical workings of Bat-Miriam's poetry, makes no reference to issues of gender and feminist critical practice. Dan Miron's more recent pathbreak- ing study of the ®rst Hebrew women poets, Imahot meyasdot, a¶ayot ¶orgot (1991), is a treasure-trove of literary-historical insights about the development of Bat- Miriam's poetic voice and style in relation to contemporary critical expectations for women's poetry. But with the exception of one reference to Virginia Woolf 's A Room of One's Own26 and a general dismissal of ``vulgar feminist criticism'' that attributes </page> <page sequence="6"> 116 ❙ Wendy Zierler all problems relating to the status of women in culture to male chauvinism27Ðnot to be confused with ``more serious and intelligent forms,'' the nature and practi- tioners of which he does not specifyÐMiron takes no interest whatsoever in the feminist critical enterprise and how it might in ̄uence the reading of poets like Bat- Miriam. It is my contention that feminist theory and gender studies o2er the strongest argument for the rereading and reengagement of works by Bat-Miriam, especially a poem cycle such as Erets Yisra¥el, which represents a conscious e2ort on the part of a Hebrew woman poet to embrace a literary tradition and to reinvent it for her own purposes. Written toward the middle of Bat-Miriam's poetic career, Erets Yisra¥el also serves as a thematic and stylistic bridge between her earlier and later poetry. Much has been made in the critical literature about Bat-Miriam of the di2erence between her early modernist poetryÐpublished in Russia when Bat-Miriam was a member of a group of Hebrew writers called the Hebrew Octoberists, who dreamed of creating a revolutionary socialist Hebrew movement in RussiaÐand her later work, which was written and published in Palestine, under the in ̄uence of the Moderna movement of Shlonsky and Alterman. Bat-Miriam's early poemsÐmost notably the cycle Mera¶ok, published in 1922 in HatekufahÐwere written in simple, clear language, without meter and rhyme, and characterized by themes of overt feminist rebellion.28 In contrast, her later poetry was written in quatrains with regular rhyme and meter; instead of simple, pared-down language and bold assertions, her language was denser and her imagery more complex and elliptical. The di2erences between her earlier and later poetry were so pronounced that critic Y. Zmorah wrote that he could hardly believe that these two bodies of work were written by the same person.29 According to Ruth Kartun-Blum, the change in Bat-Miriam's poetry after her immigration to Palestine represented a leap forward in terms of the complexity and originality of the ®gurative language.30 For others, such as Dan Miron, Bat- Miriam's later poetry represented a stylistic and thematic retreat, with her subject matter becoming ``more con®ned to the relatively narrow thematic space allotted at that time to women's poetry'': passive love, longings, expectations, maternal emotions, and the various folkloric Jewish elements reminiscent of her pious Jewish shtetl upbringing, suitable for a genuine ``Bas-Yisroel.''31 Miron calls special attention to Bat-Miriam's own role in creating this pious Jewish personaÐcritic </page> <page sequence="7"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 117 Dov Sadan dubbed her ``the most Jewish of the Hebrew woman poets''32 Ð especially her decision not to include in her collected poems Shirim (1963), those early poems that demonstrated an overt erotic interest or a more independent, openly feminist voice.33 According to Miron, Bat-Miriam remade herself and her poetry to conform to a literary ideology that required women's poetry to refrain from being overly rebellious against the norms of female behavior; to express female identity primarily in relation to the male world through images of love, longing, pregnancy, and childbirth; to remain con®ned to the generic borders of the small lyric; and to employ modernist techniques only in the most conservative sense.34 Miron himself acknowledges, however, at the end of Imahot meyasdot, a¶ayot ¶orgot, that with Erets Yisra¥el Bat-Miriam returned, in a sense, to her poetic point of origin, albeit in a di2erent form from that of the ``primitive Expressionism of Mera¶ok.''35 Erets Yisra¥el may be ®lled with liturgical and biblical references, but this traditional language and imagery takes on a highly innovative, iconoclastic, female-centered form. Insofar as there is an expression here of longing and love for the land, these emotions are dramatized as part of an unusually reciprocal plot in which the female speaker and feminized land pursue each another and unite, then break away and chase each other again. And because this plot expresses itself over the course of eleven stylistically challenging lyrics, the poem takes on something of an epic quality as well. All this brings to mind similar observations concerning the work of Devorah Baron (1887±1956), the ®rst major woman writer of Hebrew prose ®ction, whose ®ctional oeuvre divides similarly into an earlier, stridently feminist group of stories that Baron repudiated and excluded from her collected works, and a quieter, more restrained and nostalgic later group of stories that she endorsed and published in various collections.36  Many critics considered Baron's later ®ction curiously pious and traditional, static and limited in theme, form, and character development. Eli Schweid, for example, argues that Baron's stories completely bypass the spiritual and intellectual issues that agitate the major Hebrew writers of her generation; according to Schweid, the traditional, almost biblical, version of human time and experience depicted in her stories renders them at best schematic sketches, rather than real investigations of character and incident.37 Likewise, Hillel Barzel calls attention to the ``narrowness'' of setting, theme, and subject, which necessarily </page> <page sequence="8"> 118 ❙ Wendy Zierler ``weakens her work.''38 It is only recently that critics have begun to probe Baron's stories for their ``modernist techniques and protofeminist content.''39 As in the case of Baron's ®ction, the seemingly pious content of many of Bat-Miriam's later poemsÐwhat Miron describes as a world of ``folklore, red kerchiefs, coral beads, dishwashing, laundering linens, and prayers for the well-being of one's sons and daughters''40Ðoften conceals other more subversive meanings. The analogy between Bat-Miriam and Baron is particularly intriguing, given their remarkably similar biographies. Both writers grew up in Eastern European villages in staunchly religious families and immigrated to Palestine as young adults; despite their involvement in socialist Zionist activities at a time of prevailing negation of Diaspora life, both remained committed to depicting the landscape, symbolism, religious world, and personalities of the shtetl. Both Baron and Bat-Miriam began their writing careers creating works that included feminist as well as autobiographi- cal themes, only to suppress these early texts from their later collected works. Both demonstrated markedly ascetic life habits: Baron remained a recluse on a very strict and limited diet for some thirty years after her husband's death, and Bat-Miriam completely desisted from writing poetry after the death of her son Zuzik in the 1948 war, in addition to wearing black and observing various regular fast days to mourn her son.41 Baron paid little attention in her ®ction to life in the Land of Israel or other conventional matters of national signi®cance, preferring to concentrate on more marginal ``women-centered'' forms and themes. In contrast, Bat-Miriam did choose to write about her relationship with the land. Still, the picture of the land that emerges in her poetry is almost entirely detached from everyday or national life, rendered instead in strikingly personal, even abstract terms.42 In short, Bat- Miriam's Erets Yisra¥el (like a good deal of her later work) demonstrates a willingness to transgress linguistic, thematic, generic, and gender categories, a quality of inventiveness yet unacknowledged by interpreters of her verse. Some of these qualities of inventiveness can be attributed to the in ̄uence of Russian Symbolist poetry, particularly the poetry of Alexander Blok.43 Russian Symbolist poetry proceeded from the assumptions that ``even a passing phenome- non may be understood as a noumenon or as a highly signi®cant symbol,'' and that ``through the mediation and the contemplation of the principle of love,'' a concept that Blok described as the ``Eternal Feminine,'' one may ``ascend to high heaven </page> <page sequence="9"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 119 from this low world.''44 Throughout Bat-Miriam's poetryÐin consonance with the principles outlined by the Russian SymbolistsÐobjects, events, and landscapes are invested with a mysteriously metaphysical feminine quality. Like Blok's ``Poems on the Beautiful Lady,'' Bat-Miriam's Erets Yisra¥el evokes ``an unsubstantial aura, a rare®ed atmosphere. The images do not stand in clear and ®rm outline against the sky, but waver and hover, bodiless and shapeless, in mid-air.''45 Erets Yisra¥el, in which the land metamorphoses into a female ®gure who walks, runs,  ̄ies, swoops, swoons, tortures, disappoints, nurtures, and embraces, also bears the in ̄uence of Blok's Mother Russia poetry, where the land is pictured as a spiritual force, ` `an angel and a demon, a monster of nature and a spirit of the Earth.''46 This is not to say that Bat-Miriam's poetry merely mimics Russian Symbolist verse. Bat-Miriam not only Hebraizes but also Judaizes Russian Symbolism and its Russian Orthodox religious underpinnings. Erets Yisra¥el, Bat-Miriam's drama of a female poet's search for the (female) divine presence within the land, is thoroughly Hebrew and biblical, loosely modeled after the biblical Song of Songs and with scattered allusions to the story of Elijah the prophet, as well as other biblical narratives. Both the prophetic habit of female personi®cation of the land and the Russian Symbolist cult of the ``Eternal Feminine'' were fundamentally male- centered poetic practices. In this sense, Bat-Miriam's Erets Yisra¥el, with its persistent female-centeredness, represents a signi®cant breakthrough. Some of the themes and poetic ®gures that ®gure prominently in Erets Yisra¥el are already evident in Bat-Miriam's earlier Land of Israel poetry, speci®cally, Rei¶ayim shel zahav (Millstones of gold), which was published as part of her ®rst book of collected poems, Mera¶ok (1932).47 As in Erets Yisra¥el, the landscape of Israel in Rei¶ayim shel zahav is often ®gured in terms of Jewish textual imagery. In poem 1, for example, a windy Israeli nightscape is compared to a sudden, mystical opening of books of the Talmud, with the movements of winds, likened to rabbis engaged in a legal debate (Mera¶ok, p. 67). Later in the cycle, the textual metaphors become more explicitly biblical and Near Eastern, as in ``Kifsuqim hayamim'' (Like verses the days), where time and life on the land are depicted through a series of biblical and archaeological similes: ` `Like verses the days, hidden psalms / the nights, like ``selah'' sealing the song / . . . Like shepherds tents are the curtains of the sky / And Moses falling prostrate, the shadow, / like the vases of Canaan's daughters, the </page> <page sequence="10"> 120 ❙ Wendy Zierler blue evenings / like a golden crescent the night moon'' (Mera¶ok, p. 77). In the second part of the poem, Bat-Miriam shifts from description of the landscape to a more personal re ̄ection on her identity as represented by her adopted matronym, Bat-Miriam. Placing herself within this ancient Near Eastern landscape, Bat- Miriam imagines herself dancing and singing the Song of the Sea together with the biblical Miriam, in e2ect becoming the successor of the biblical prophetess/poetess. Likewise, in poem 9, Bat-Miriam imagines herself as part of a group of ``desert daughters'' who listen to the wonders and miracles of the rocks, thereby bringing to life the marvelous legends of the land, and whose ``attentive, vigilant steps'' (Mera¶ok, pp. 79±80) measure and renew the ancient memories of the nation. It is important to note, however, that the female emphasis in these poems, where it appears, remains within the human sphere. While the land is occasionally described here in feminine terms, little is made of the female personi®cation. Instead, Bat- Miriam con®nes herself to imagining the presence of female folk poets who use their poetic and mystical sensibilities to uncover the various transcendent features of the landscape. This notion of re ̄ecting on the concrete aspects of the land for the purposes of revealing/pursuing metaphysical truth assumes a central position in Erets Yisra¥el. In general, with the notable exception of ``Kifsukim hayamim,'' the re ̄ections on the land in these poems occur within a conventional, gender-neutral (even clicheÂ), collective context, as in poem 4, for example, where the poet speaks for the whole nation, which longs to return to the Jewish homeland: ``But one thousand, every thousand [years] are but a day / only yesterday we left our homeland / yesterday we fell victim upon her / with the great devotion of a lost soul'' (Mera¶ok, p. 72). In the poem ` `Yerushalayim,'' published in Musaf davar in 1936, less than a year before the appearance of the Erets Yisra¥el cycle,48 Bat-Miriam's writings about the land and cities of Israel begin to demonstrate the stylistic and thematic features that are so prominent in Erets Yisra¥el. In contrast to the relatively straightforward and simple language of Re¶ayim shel zahav, the language in ``Yerushalayim'' is denser, more elliptical, and syntactically manipulated. In terms of female personi®cation imagery, Zion here is clearly feminized. Unlike the various biblical feminizations of the land, the city is neither wife nor widow, daughter nor bride, mourner nor mourned. Instead, she is a kind of female wanderer/explorer, whose various </page> <page sequence="11"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 121 movements and ascensions represent the diverse geological and archaeological features of the city. Though cut and inscribed in stone, seemingly static and immovable, the feminized Jerusalem rises, thinks, gropes, and turns; ``wrapped'' in the sounds of churchbells, she ` `raises a smiling wall, before an ancient remembering tower'' (Shirim, pp. 175±76). In this poem, all the elements of the city, even those with the greatest ballast and ®xity, are depicted as animate and moving. In contrast to Re¶ayim shel zahav, where the land remains a largely passive object of re ̄ection, in this poem, the city yearns and stands and imagines. With her spaces that ``golden and die,'' she demonstrates an elusive as well as prophetic quality that Bat-Miriam associates with ¶azon ¦ami, the biblical/prophetic visions of her people. All these elements reappear in Bat-Miriam's longer work, Erets Yisra¥el, but in much more ampli®ed and female-centered forms. On the most basic level, the female-centeredness of Erets Yisra¥el inheres in the grammar of the poems. Indeed, one of the major problems with translating and writing about Erets Yisra¥el in English is that one loses the e2ect of the constant repetition of the second-person feminine pronoun at,49 as well as all the feminine conjugations of the verbs. In some of her other cycles, such as Midrakhah geshumah and Shirei Russyah, Bat-Miriam's speaker alternates between addressing the object of her love and re ̄ection in masculine and feminine terms. In Erets Yisra¥el, however, the entire drama unfolds between two female characters: the female poet and the feminized land. Like the biblical tradition that endows the personi®ed Zion or Israel with a variety of personae, the feminized land in Bat-Miriam's poem wears many guises, plays many roles, and assumes many forms, both conventional and unconventional. Female-centeredness may also be identi®ed in the language and style of the poems. Although the in ̄uence of (male) Symbolist poetry has already been acknowledged, Bat-Miriam's highly elliptical, mystical language, together with the continually shifting and blurring identities of both the land and the female poetic speaker, also seems to anticipate the e2orts of French feminist critics such as HeÂleÁne Cixous and Luce Irigaray to posit an alternative, non-phallologocentric woman's writing that de®es traditional gender binarities and unsettles ®xed meanings. In fact, the e2orts of French feminist theorists to describe new forms of writing and language that partake of and yet also deconstruct patriarchal tradition are relevant to </page> <page sequence="12"> 122 ❙ Wendy Zierler the poetic project and poetic style of Bat-Miriam. According to Cixous, in her well- known essay ``Castration or Decapitation?'' what distinguishes a feminine textual body is that it allows ` `parts, partings, and separations''; it ` `is always endless, without ending, there's not closure, it doesn't stop, and it is this that very often makes the feminine text di3cult to read. . . . A feminine text starts on all sides at once, starts twenty times, thirty times over.'' 50 Drawing on Lacanian psychoanalysis as well as a female sexual metaphor of the ``two lips,'' Irigaray's theory of feminine behavior and language similarly emphasizes endlessness, changeability, contradiction, even incoherence: She [woman] is inde®nitely other in herself. This is doubtless why she is said to be whimsical, incomprehensible, agitated, capricious . . . not to mention her language in which ``she'' sets o2 in all directions leaving ``him'' unable to discern the coherence of any meaning. Hers are contra- dictory words, somewhat mad from the standpoint of reason, inaudible for whoever listens to them with ready-made grids, with a fully elabo- rated code in hand. For in what she says, too, at least when she dares, woman is constantly touching herself. She steps ever so slightly aside from herself with a murmur, an exclamation, a whisper, a sentence left un®nished. . . . When she returns it is to set o2 again from elsewhere.51 One can certainly quarrel with the essentialist underpinnings of these theories of eÂcriture feminine; it is di3cult to accept the idea of women's language necessarily and essentially embodying these traits. At the same time, these formulations describe accurately the kinds of feminine identity, movement, and language presented in Erets Yisra¥el. Echoing, or more correctly, pre®guring, Cixous's description of the endlessly continuing and recommencing feminine text, Bat-Miriam's poem cycle moves through a series of repeating and yet changing, resolved and yet endlessly unresolved, scenes of encounter between the female speaker and the feminine land. In consonance with Irigaray's description of woman and her words in This Sex Which Is Not One, the feminized land in Erets Yisra¥el as well as the language used to describe her is indeed ``whimsical, incomprehensible, agitated, and capricious,'' setting o2 in various directions that defy conventional notions of coherence and </page> <page sequence="13"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 123 meaning. Irigaray's description of woman's ``contradictory words, mad from the standpoint of reason'' ®nds resonance in the plethora of oxymoronic ®gures and contradictions in terms that occur throughout the cycle. In the second stanza of poem 1, for example, the land is described as a ``sweeping wing,'' evident and visible in the ``shadows of cities, mountains, desert,'' and also as a ``hidden image'' (line 9, Shirim, p. 39), ``this but not this'' (line 120, p. 45). In poem 2, the land self- contradictorily ``blazes wearily'' (line 29, p. 40), ``leaps helplessly'' (line 39, p. 41), appears ``poor'' and ``illuminated'' all at once. One moment, the poet-speaker is describing the land in terms of its realistic, spare topography: ``Mountain, hill, tormented strip of sand / without shade, fountain or tree'' (line 17, p. 40). The next moment, the poet shifts the terms of reference to the lofty and metaphysicalÐ ``deep abysses, visions, and glory'' (line 33, p. 40)Ðimagining the land as a re ̄ection of the dreams of an unseen God (p. 40). Throughout the poem, the female land both embodies and de®es the various conventional images of femininity that are part of the traditional association between woman and land/earth/city. In poem 4, Bat-Miriam portrays the land in ways that are typical of biblical tradition and modern Hebrew poetry of the Third Aliyah period, calling attention to the harsh sunlight, the ``thorn and thistle'' (p. 40), the naked landscape, the ``mountain, rock, and heaps of desolation'' (p. 42).52 This poor, parched, forsaken land, like the abandoned widow of the Book of Lamentations or the lamenting spirit of Zion in Jeremiah, ``beats her breast for her sins'' (poem 8, line 205, p. 49) and weeps like a small child on the lap of the poetic speaker. This same feminized land, however, also rises above these diminishments, soaring and  ̄ying (p. 50) in a kind of  ̄aming, whirling, stormy ecstasy, reminiscent of the bold, rebellious, and ecstatic pro- nouncements of Bat-Miriam's poetic speaker in her early love cycle Mera¶ok. Images of  ̄ying, soaring, and being carried aloft recur throughout the poem cycle. ``Your sweeping wing but leads to / shadows of cities, mountains, desert / gathering the ends of my stormy soul / to the arc of your hidden image,'' writes Bat- Miriam in poem 1 (line 5, p. 39). ``Merely panting, merely breathing and shining / From end to illuminated end / A chariot of ®re swooping and stretching / your longing, alighting, excited,'' she continues in poem 2 (lines 25±28, p. 40).53 All this brings to mind HeÂleÁne Cixous's double usage of the French verb voler, which means ``to  ̄y'' as well as ``to steal,'' in order to describe the ways in which women over the </page> <page sequence="14"> 124 ❙ Wendy Zierler centuries have managed to enter into language and culture despite patriarchal strictures. According to Cixous, women writers have to  ̄y over/steal through generic and gender borders in order to liberate patriarchal language from its disenabling ®xities and binarities and make it their own. ` `We have all learned  ̄ ight/ theft,'' Cixous writes, ``the art with many techniques, for all the centuries we have only had access to having by stealing/ ̄ying; we have lived in a  ̄ight/theft, stealing/  ̄ying, ®nding the close, concealed ways-through of desire.''54 In Erets Yisra¥el, Bat- Miriam's language and feminized land both do precisely this:  ̄ying and stealing in and out of many unexpected or contradictory structures, stealing into various (patriarchal) forms of language, and reinventing them for new purposes. One speci®c way in which Bat-Miriam  ̄ies/steals into patriarchal language is through revisions of masculine God-language and liturgical structures. Throughout the poem, Bat-Miriam's poetic speaker describes her pursuit of the feminine land as a kind of search for God. At shokhnah bekhol mekupelet (You [feminine] dwell in pleated blue), the poem cycle begins, immediately bringing to mind, through the word ``shokhnah,'' the Shekhinah, the traditional (feminine) term for the presence of God. In contrast, however, with traditional Shekhinah imagery, the land is depicted here as an anthropomorphic female deity, stroking and trilling her own, ancient thoughts, with a ``warm divine hand'' (line 3, p. 39). Yet this highly physical and visible representation of the land is not the only version of the female land-as- God image in the cycle. Repeatedly, almost incantatorily in the poem, the land as the feminine divine is described as simultaneously ``revealed and concealed,'' as visible through the features of the landscape, but never truly seen or comprehended. Bat-Miriam praises/prays to the feminine land in a modi®ed version of the opening line of the Kaddish, a prayer traditionally recited by mourners, which extols the greatness and splendor of God and His works. The prayer begins with the words yitgadal veyitkadash shmei rabah (Magni®ed and sancti®ed be God's great name). In Bat-Miriam's paean to the feminized Land of Israel, of course, this opening line is reconjugated in the feminine voiceÐ titgadal vetitkadash (line 15, p. 39)Ðto accommodate the female gender of the land. On the one hand, Bat-Miriam's use of the kaddish prayer seems like a pious Zionist national utterance. On the other hand, Bat-Miriam puts a mysterious and elliptical cast on the traditional prayer that praises God's holy name and calls for widespread recognition of His majesty and </page> <page sequence="15"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 125 rule. Instead of an image of an ``exalted, honored, adored, and lauded'' God-King, Bat-Miriam's speaker praises her (feminine) godly land for being in®nitely myste- rious, incomplete and ``unredeemed'': titgadal vetitkadash lo nig¥elet / ta¦alumotekh bi la¦ad tevu¦ah (Be magni®ed and sancti®ed, unredeemed / Your mystery ever stamped within me) (lines 15±16, p. 39). Recurrent in the poem are also feminizations of the traditional liturgical pronouncements of the Oneness of GodÐvehu e¶ad, ve¥ein sheini (And He is One, and there is none other), as in the well-known liturgical poem ``Adon ¦olam'' (The Lord eternal). ``In all you are One, solitary you,'' proclaims Bat-Miriam at the beginning of the fourth poem. ` `None other was ever like you'' (line 70, p. 42). ` `Only you'' (line 85, p. 44), she intones, designating the land as the sole object of her devoted worship and pursuit. At the same time as she a3rms the all-encompassing, self-contained unity of the landÐ``From you and back to your streaming self! / Within you and your heralding self!'' (poem 5, lines 109±10, pp. 42±43)ÐBat-Miriam also allows the land an interdenominational, almost polytheistic, multiplicity of form and represen- tation. The land appears as God and as a representation of divine thought (poem 2, line 37, p. 41), as well as a ``forging'' of the ``letters of God's name'' (poem 7, p. 46). Bat-Miriam's feminine land is also seen as encompassing and embodying the wisdom and thought of the ``gods of Tyre, Sidon, and Canaan,'' represented in sculpted form with ``eyes closed'' and with ``leg and hand lopped o2 '' (poem 8, lines 197±98). These polytheistic archaeological images reimagine the downtrodden, crippled appearance of the desolate land as a supernatural entity that transcends the regular, formal order of human life and vision. One cannot overstress the e2ect rendered by Bat-Miriam's feminization of these representations and liturgical invocations of the divine in her descriptions of the land. In contrast to Hebrew poetic tradition, where the feminine land is metaphorically imagined as the female consort of the masculine God or of an exiled husband/lover, here the feminized land becomes God herself/selves. If, according to patriarchal convention, woman remains ®xed in an intermediate position lower on the scale of transcendence than man, Bat-Miriam's Erets Yisra¥el, where a feminine entity is invested with all the features of godliness and metaphysicality, turns all this on its head. At the same time, Bat-Miriam seems unwilling to settle on one </page> <page sequence="16"> 126 ❙ Wendy Zierler particular de®nition of, or metaphor for, the (female) land. Repeatedly, through the absence of clarifying pronominal antecedents, there is a blurring of the distinction between the female speaker of the poem and the feminized land; often they explicitly switch roles. Once again, this brings to mind the writings of Luce Irigaray. According to Irigaray, women ``are engaged in the process of both constructing and deconstructing their identities, their essences, simultaneously.''55 As Diana Fuss explains Irigaray, ``to speak (as) woman is ceaselessly to embrace words and persistently to cast them o2. To touch upon but never to solidify, to put into play but never to arrive at a ®nal telos or meaning.''56 This notion of simultaneously embracing and casting o2 words and identities, of touching upon but never truly possessing meaning, is dramatized throughout the cycle in the many allusions to the biblical pursuit-evasion plot of Song of Songs. Local allusions to the Song of Songs are scattered throughout the poem: Bat- Miriam's poem cycle begins, as does the biblical Song, with the speaker being led by the wing and drawn into pursuit of her beloved (``Draw me after you, let us run!'' Song of Songs 1:4).57 In poem 3, the poet pursues her beloved land through a metaphorical garden, through the ``green e ̧orescence,'' climbing and clinging to ``the myrrh of your memory'' (lines 50, 52, p. 45), a synaesthetic image evocative of the Song (the word ``myrrh,'' which ®gures throughout the Song, is the marker). Similarly, in poem 6 of the cycle, the land is represented metaphorically as ``gazelle in the shadow of mountains,'' an allusion to any number of gazelle images in the Song of Songs, such as the Shulamite's comparison of her love to a gazelle leaping over the mountains (Song of Songs 2:8±9) or Solomon's comparison of his lover's breasts to ``two fawns, twins of gazelle'' (Song of Songs 6:4). The plot of the biblical songÐits sequences of unions and evasions, of meet- ings and missesÐis also liberally incorporated into Bat-Miriam's poem cycle.58 Instead of a love story between the male Solomon and the female Shulamite, however, Bat-Miriam's poem cycle tells the story of a female poet's continual pursuit of a feminine land, and vice versa. If, as Phyllis Trible has suggested, the uniqueness of the Song of Songs inheres in its inclusion of a dominant female voice that opens and closes the Song59 and in its representation of mutuality, reciprocity, and harmony in male-female love, Bat-Miriam's poem cycle, which grants this power to two female characters, goes even further. Although the land does not raise her voice </page> <page sequence="17"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 127 and actually speak in the poem as the poet does (and as do the lover-actors in the biblical Song), the Land acts, moves and pursues her poet-beloved. I do not mean to argue that the central plot of Erets Yisra¥el is necessarily homoerotic: Bat-Miriam's female Land of Israel is not primarily a sexual ®gure, but assumes a multiplicity of feminine roles: mother, sister, daughter, and God(dess). Bat-Miriam's poem cycle does not teem with erotic symbolism and tactile imagery, as the Song of Songs does. But it most certainly reads as a powerful female rendition of its themes. As Ilana Pardes has observed, ``desire reigns in the Song, not ful®llment.''60 Likewise, it is the endurance and recurrence of desire, rather than its consummation, that propels the plot of Bat-Miriam's Erets Yisra¥el. Over and over again, the poet rises in pursuit of the beloved land, wanders with her ` `in the radiant blue61 of roads'' (poem 5, line 90, p. 43) or gazes upon the ``face of the land'' at the ``radiant peaks of Eden-trees'' (poem 8, line 214, p. 49), only to retreat and declare that she cannot catch her. She strains to behold and ®nd the land, catches sight of her and o2ers a description, only to conclude that she cannot be seen at all, or, as in the ®rst poem, that she will only be able to ``see'' the land when she closes her eyes permanently in death and merges physically with the land, her ``dust'' covering her ``closed eye'' (poem 1, lines 9±12). The land and poet repeatedly unite, only to miss each other again, and so on. This plot of pursuit and evasion operates on a micro- and macroscopic level in the poem. On a microscopic level, this scenario is dramatized in Bat-Miriam's repeated yoking together of disparate or, more precisely, contradictory, verbs or predicate adjectives. The land is simultaneously ``alive'' and yet ``hidden'' (line 83). The poet-speaker ``forgets'' the land, only ``to seek'' her ``in every path'' (line 141); ``murmurs'' about the land ` `what cannot be pronounced'' (line 216); pursues the land with ` `the hope of after-despair'' (line 100); and identi®es her ` `form like this, not like this'' (line 120). The e2ect of this technique is a continual forti®cation of descriptive desire and a continual thwarting of its consummation. On a macroscopic level, the pursuit-evasion theme plays out in the unfolding plot of the cycle. In poem 2, the poet comes close enough to the land to be able to o2er a relatively realistic portrait of the Israeli desert landscape, only for the land to leap away in mysterious, incomprehensible  ̄ight. In turn, in poem 3, the land chases after and pursues the poet, who, lagging and falling in the sand, calls out to </page> <page sequence="18"> 128 ❙ Wendy Zierler her beloved land. The two join together brie ̄y ``in the light of the watch . . . in confusion and shield'' (line 57, p. 42)Ðan overturning of the plot in the biblical Song, where the meeting of Solomon and the Shulamite is thwarted by the violent intercession of the night watchmen. Bat-Miriam not only incorporates literal references to the Song, but also the rabbinic allegorical interpretation of the Song as a representation of the thwarted, unconsummated relationship between God and Israel and the subsequent exile of the people of Israel from the land. Throughout the cycle, the pursuit-evasion plot of the Song of Songs functions as a narrative representation of Bat-Miriam's compli- cated relationship with the Land of Israel, her estrangement from and aspired reunion with the land through aliyah. In two separate places in the poem cycle, the poet's connection with her adopted new homeland of Israel is frustrated by interceding images of her native Russia. In the fourth poem of the cycle, the poet attempts to stave o2 memories of her beloved former homeland by insisting that ``none other was ever like you'' (p. 42). In fact, she attempts to deny completely the allure of the Russian landscape: ``Never, with longing unquiet,'' claims the new immigrant Bat-Miriam, ``did a live foreign wing stroke my nights'' (lines 71±72, p. 42). But this attempt at denial cannot dam the rush of memory, and from then on, the poet's visions of her past homeland become even clearer and more pristineÐthe white, tempestuous beauty of winter, forests ` `growing greener and greener'' (line 78, p. 43)Ðall in contradistinction with the parched, desolate appearance of the Israeli landscape, which ` `crawls'' upon its ` `su2ering,'' as if to be revived by the return of the Jews to her borders. The ``foreign wing''Ðliterally, the ``wing of a foreign land''Ðreappears again in poem 5, and the immigrant experience, as a narrative of unsuccessful union, is represented once again, but this time, in an even more unsettling, violent manner. Beaten and scorched by the harsh sun of her beloved Israel, the poet closes her eyes and yearns, ``with longing great and hungry'' for the Russia of her dreams. This passage is highly reminiscent of the night scene in Song of Songs 5, where the Shulamite takes o2 her robe, lies down upon her bed, and gives herself over to her own private dreams, only to be aroused by the knocking of her beloved upon her door. Withdrawn into dreams of Russia, Bat-Miriam's speaker hesitates to answer the call of the Land of Israel. Following the lead of the Shulamite, however, the </page> <page sequence="19"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 129 poet-speaker awakens and is pulled once again into the pursuit, ``As if to return and answer / A sole heart's longing'' (lines 106±7). The Zionist immigrant experience is invoked in very speci®c terms in poem 9, where the poet gazes upon the ``simple, rude, and diminished'' (line 220, p. 50) scenery of her beloved new homeland, and laments the collective forsaking of the land, which was the Jewish Diaspora. In the ®rst stanza, the poet bewails the abandonment of her beloved land against the backdrop of a Bedouin Arab walking in the desert. The companionship and tribute o2ered to the land by the Bedouin seem but a poor trace of past glories: ``Only he, walking and listening / To the secret of a proud-humble camel's sorrow, / Binds your dawning glory / In the parting of his ragged clothes'' (lines 224±27, p. 50). The thorn-ridden covering of the land is a further reminder of the dwindled beauty of the land, her ``forgotten landscape of palm'' (line 228, p. 50). This enumeration of the su2erings and humiliations of the land is yet another instance of the plot of temporarily frustrated union. These disturbing images, like the beatings of the Shulamite by the night watchmen in Song of Songs 5:7, once again thwart the reunion of the poet and her beloved, divine land. That is, until the poet actively rea3rms her commitment. ``Forsaken'' is the land, but ``never forgotten / Estranged, but within me ever sealed'' (lines 233±34, p. 50), she says, recalling the end of Songs of Songs (8:6), where the Shulamite beseeches her beloved to place her ` `as a seal upon [her] heart, like the seal upon your hand.'' Like the Song of Songs, where even this gesture toward consummation does not fully conclude or resolve the plot of pursuit and loveÐthe Song ends not in ultimate union, but with an invitation to enjoy (``Hurry, my beloved, swift as a gazelle or young stag, to the hills of spices'')62ÐBat-Miriam's Erets Yisra¥el ends unresolved, in mystery, with the intimation of ongoing drama. In poem 12, the Zionist immigration theme refrains one ®nal time, but redemption is still described as a ``desire unful®lled'' and unseen. Like the lover running o2 to the hills of spices, the female land is carried o2 ``unredeemed'' in a ``chariot of ®re between the mountains of the world.'' This brings us to the ®nal major set of themes at work in the poem cycle: the theme of prophecy. Throughout the cycle, Bat-Miriam represents the land as a feminine reincarnation of various prophets and leaders, most importantly, Elijah, </page> <page sequence="20"> 130 ❙ Wendy Zierler the prophet carried o2 to his death in a chariot of ®re and the ®gure most commonly associated with the messianic redemption of the children of Israel. The cycle is bracketed at its beginning and its end by references to the story of Elijah the prophet. The ®rst reference comes in poem 2, where the land is compared to ``a chariot of ®re swooping and stretching'' (line 27, p. 40). A more speci®c allusion to the Elijah narrative occurs in the last stanza of poem 4: zl¤ t¤ FPd©  Yz§ ©`  wx© ,Yz§ ©`  wx© Ð "!ia¦  ̈` " :lFw é`ll§  d  ̈` ix¦w§ aA¦ zl¤ h¤ x§r© z§ n¦  ,dx ̈cC§aA© z§ n¦  j§ n¥ k§ W¦  lr© !`ia¦ p ̈Pd©  hin¦ W§ d¦ W¤  ,j§ Yz¥ x§cC© ©` Only you, only you falling In a voiceless cry: Father! On your shoulder, slips apart, uncovered Your mantle, cast o2 by the prophet. (lines 85±88, p. 43) The speci®c reference here is to the miraculous death/disappearance of Elijah as witnessed by his devoted servant Elisha. In Bat-Miriam's revision of this episode, the su2ering beaten land is actually reembodied as a female version of Elisha, crying, ``O Father! Father! Israel's chariots and horsemen!'' (2 Kings 2:12). Elisha's witnessing of Elijah's ascent is both a heartrending and hopeful event, for though Elisha has become bereft of his father-mentor, his ability to see the vision of the chariot of ®re is a sign (prearranged by Elijah) that he has been granted a double portion of Elijah's prophetic spirit (2 Kings 2:10). As Elijah ascends to the sky, his mantle, a symbol and instrument of his prophecy and wondrous powers (which functions much like the sta2 of the great prophet Moses) drops down to the earth, and Elisha becomes its inheritor, that is, Elijah's prophetic successor. Here in Bat- Miriam's poem, the Land of Israel, as a female Elisha, inherits the prophetic mantle and the double portion of spirit previously accorded to Elijah, the prophetic harbinger of redemption. In other words, the newly regenerating Zionist land has </page> <page sequence="21"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 131 become the source of wonder and prophetic revelation for the modern children of Israel in general and the female poet in particular. In the middle sections of the poem cycle that intervene between the ®rst ``chariot of ®re'' image and the ®nal one that concludes the cycle, the female land takes on several other prophetic/messianic guises. In poem 6, the land ``prophesies in the radiant dream'' of the ``chained messiah,'' namely, the cruci®ed Jesus. In poem 8, the land is resurrected as a Nazirite pursuing or reinvigorating the previous signs, wonders, and prophecies of Jesus. In the stanza immediately following that one, various synecdoches of the land are endowed with divine/prophetic inspiration: ,r©a¥ FYd©  l ¥`  z ©` p§ w¦  Ð WFxa§ E .hl© n§ p¦  ic¦Bb§  dW¤ éOn¦  Ð wg ̈x§n¤ E ,r©W¥ Fd lW¤  Fzr ̈n§ c¦aA§  ,mW ̈ i ¥` e§ .hn© W§ pP¦W¤  FwEqtR§  Ð zx¤pP¤kM¦ And cypressÐthe envy of the demanding God, And distanceÐa goat escaped from Moses'  ̄ock. And over there, in the teardrop of Hosea, KineretÐhis verse that slipped out. (lines 184±87, p. 48) As in ``Kifsukim hayamim,'' where the features of the landscape are described in terms of various textual/archaeological similes, here the indigenous cypress tree is depicted as a sign of the ` `envy of the demanding God,'' that is, the jealous protection by the prophets of the supreme oneness of God. The distances charted by the poet's eye are represented by the wandering of a goat from the shepherd/prophet Moses' literal as well as metaphorical  ̄ock. Likewise, the waters of the Kineret, the Sea of Galilee, are seen as one great embodiment of the tearful, tragic prophecies of the prophet Hosea. All these prophetic allusions point to the historical role of the land as a site of great prophecy and revelation. Toward the end of the poem, the poetic speaker of the poem presents herself as the disciple of the prophetic/poetic Land: </page> <page sequence="22"> 132 ❙ Wendy Zierler ,zr© Bb©x§p¦ Î é`l Yz§ v§ nO© ¦`  mW ̈ ,zib¦ d ̈ mW ̈ ,d  ̈` pP§ w©n§ E dx ̈qQ§ i©n§  ,Yz§ g§ tR© h¦  mW ̈ ,zr© p©k§ p¦ Î é`l dw ̈pP§ f©n§ d©  iW¦ t§ p©  z ¤` .dc ̈a¥ k§ E dl ̈FcBb§ d©  ig¦ Ex z ¤` za¤ WX¤ pan§ kM¦  ip© t ̈R z ¤`  `U ̈V ¤`  cr© ,xd¥ Fpd©  j§ p¥Fin§ cC¦  ll© g£n¥ za¤ W¤ g§ n© kM§  ip© t ̈R z ¤`  `U ̈V ¤`  cr© .xv¥ FId©  j§ n¥ Flg£  dx ̈b§ q ̈QW¤ There you mediated, there you adopted unrelenting, There you nurtured tortured and jealous, My leaping, unsubmissive soul, My great heavy spirit.

(poem 10, lines 280±87, p. 53) Here, as in the rest of the cycle, the relationship experienced by the speaker and the land is depicted in strikingly intimate and private terms; with the exception of the Arab Bedouin who appears in poem 9, the poem includes no other human witnesses to the poet's relationship with the land and o2ers little descriptive evidence of Zionist settlement. Instead, Bat-Miriam o2ers an account of a personal and reciprocal relationship with the land, setting herself up as a source of prophetic inspiration for her readers. If in poem 9, the land is depicted as a child weeping on the lap of the female poet, in this poem, the poet/prophet land, with her ``streaming imagination,'' becomes mother/mentor to the poet-speaker, training, nurturing her ``leaping unsubmissive soul'' (lines 280±87, p. 53). In contrast to the intimate private descriptions that characterize the ®rst ten lyrics of the cycle, the ®nal poem evinces a collective, national tone: </page> <page sequence="23"> Yokheved Bat-Miriam's Female Personi®cations of Erets Israel ❙ 133 zx¤ ¤` EOd©  iv¦ x§ ©`  ,iv¦ x§ ©` `U ̈Vp¦ e§ wl ̈c§pP¦ d©  inO¦ r©  oFfg£aA© zx¤Yz¤ t§ p¦  é`l zEctR§  zd© in¦ kM§  dx¤Ffe§ .xr ̈q§ p¦ e§ ml ̈r§ p¤ ml ̈Fr l ¤` zl¤ g¤ l§ ga n§  z`UV¥ p¦  Yz§ ©`  FY ¦` ,la¥ Yz¥  lW¤  dl ̈l ̈g£aA©  dx ̈FUa§ kM¦ ,zl¤ ¤` b§ p¦ Î é`l z`UV¥ p¦  Yz§ ©`  FY ¦` .la¥ z¥  ix¥x§d©  oiaA¥  W ¥`  ak¤ x¤ My land, my illuminated land In the vision of my people ®red and rising And scattering a desire for redemption unful®lled To a stormy world unseen. With this you are carried, scattering Like tidings in the space of the world, With this you are carried, unredeemed, A chariot of ®re amid the mountains of the world. (poem 11, p. 53) It is perhaps because of the collective tone of this ®nal poem, speaking for ``my people'' rather than just for ``myself,'' that it is so often quoted and celebrated in the critical literature as representative of the cycle as a whole. ` ` `A chariot of ®re amid the mountains of the world,' this is how the Land of Israel rises from this volume,'' writes poet Natan Alterman, enthusiastically referring to the prophetic allusion that closes the poem as typical of Bat-Miriam's poetic portrayal of the land.63 The collective tone of this poem is enhanced by the traditional association between Elijah the prophet and the ideology of messianic redemption. At the same time, the Elijah reference also conceals a bold, individual statement wherein Bat-Miriam becomes a successor to Elisha, the prototypical inheritor of prophecy. Like Elisha, who witnesses Elijah's chariot of ®re in the Book of Kings, and like the feminized land, who witnesses the same earlier in the cycle in poem 4, the poet-speaker, as witness to the chariot(ess) of ®re, inherits the double-portioned poetic/prophetic legacy of the land. But unlike the traditional associations between Elijah and </page> <page sequence="24"> 134 ❙ Wendy Zierler messianic redemption, Bat-Miriam's chariot(ess) of ®re is carried aloft, unre- deemed, pointing to the way in which endlessly deferred, un®nished spiritual quests engender poetry.

According to Shoham, immigrant poets such as Bat-Miriam, Y. Karny, and A. Shlonsky longed to embrace their new homeland in all of its aspects, but su2ered from a sense of estrangement and yearning for the Russian landscape of their youth. This prevented them, Shoham argues, from composing convincing, realistic descriptions, leading them to rely instead upon ready-made, traditional images of the land. Shoham contrasts this with what he considers the more ``authentic'' and realistic landscape poetry of Esther Raab, the ®rst sabra poet. While Shoham mounts a compelling argument about the ways in which the immigrant experience informed the writing of these poets, he fails to acknowledge that for a Symbolist poet such as Bat-Miriam, abstract, metaphysical description represents a deliberate aesthetic stance and a preferred poetic practice.

The land draws the poet after her, is drawn into itself or drawn after the poet, and so on. 58 Kartun-Blum, Bamer¶ak hane¦elam, p. 27. 59 See Phyllis Trible, God and the Rhetoric of Sexuality (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1978), p. 145.  60 Ilana Pardes, Countertraditions in the Bible (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992), p. 126. 61 Hillel Barzel and later, Ruth Kartun-Blum, argue that Bat-Miriam's use of the color blue is very deliberate. According to Barzel, in his article ``Besod haremez vehanirmaz'' (Haboker, 9 September 1964), blue in Bat-Miriam's poetry, in its association with the heavens, the ocean, and the horizon, represents longing and yearning toward transcendence. 62 Song of Songs 8:14. 63 Alterman, p. 83. </page> </plain_text>
