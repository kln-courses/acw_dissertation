<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROLES AND INNOVATIONS IN MEDICINE* JOSEPH BEN-DAVID ABSTRACT The pioneers in bacteriology and psychoanalysis illustrate the characteristics of scientific innovators who begin investigating problems defined at the time by scientific consensus as beyond the scope of sci- ence. Typically, the innovators were practitioners who were involved in research and academic teaching as a side-line, or "role hybrids," that is, theoretical scientists who were driven by personal or professional reasons to solve practical problems. With the spread of professionalization, other fields may gain their innovations from such sources. Until approximately the middle of the last century the majority of men engaged in scientific research were not scientists in their main occupation. But contemporary re- search in most of the sciences has become a career, chosen like any other profession. This trend was first discernible in Germany in the second half of the last century, and it has further developed during this century, mainly in the United States and lately in Russia. In Britain and France the develop- ment was slower, but the same tendency is observable there. The development of scientific research into a separate profession brought about a considerable acceleration in the process of discovery. Indeed, it has been one of the conditions which made it possible to turn science from an unpredictable process into a tool which can be applied to practical pur- poses.' But scientific advance has many facets: besides increased activity, meas- ured by indexes such as discoveries, pub- lications, or, in technology, patents, there are questions of the quality and the type of discovery. In the latter respects the results of pro- fessional science may not be unequivocally superior to those of amateur science. Doubts are raised by at least one plausible hypoth- esis often mentioned in the literature on technological inventions: that "revolution- ary" inventions are usually made by out- siders, that is, by men who are not engaged in the occupation which is affected by them and are, therefore, not bound by professional custom and tradition.2 This proposition- if it has any substance-suggests interesting implications for the development of science. According to it, professionalization, which necessarily turns scientific research into a monopoly of insiders rather than-as it used to be until well into the nineteenth century-of inspired amateurs (i.e., out- siders), may ultimately endanger its revolu- tionary character. Propositions formulated in such general terms are often of limited relevance. In addi- tion, the professionalization of science is an inevitable corollary of its development, and there seems to be much empirical evidence that the process has not, in fact, diminished the revolutionary character of science. In- deed, one of the chief proponents of the proposition suggests that it be increasingly less relevant under present-day conditions.3 * The first draft of this paper was written while the author was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, Stanford, Cali- fornia.

The difficulty with the application of the proposition seems to be the loose definition of the outsider as well as of revolutionary innovation (or invention, or discovery). Obviously, the meaning of outsider changes with increasing differentiation of roles. The distance between the respective roles of a farmer and a medicine man in a primitive society-in terms of the knowledge which is necessary to perform them, the socializa- tion through which the individual reaches them, and the social context within which both roles are performed-is perhaps less than the distance between the experimental physiologist and the physician who uses the results of his work.4 It is obvious, therefore, that any useful application of the proposi- tion has to be based on a precise definition and analysis of roles. Similarly, the term "revolutionary" innovation has to be re- placed by a more specific one. We must in- vestigate, therefore, the relationship be- tween the definitions of the roles of people engaged in research and in practice in a cer- tain field and the kind of innovations pro- duced there. We propose to investigate the relationship in the field of medicine. In medicine it is relatively easy to find two distinct roles which are interrelated and mixed in various ways in various countries: the career sci- entists, especially in the basic medical sci- ences (whether trained in medicine or not), and the medical practitioners who receive considerable scientific training but are not engaged in research as an occupation. Until the middle of the last century the two roles were only rudimentarily differentiated. Sci- ence was not yet a career, and the majority of biologists, and quite a few scientists in other fields, too, were practicing doctors or at least initially chose medicine as their career, only later, as a result of exceptional achievement, to become full-time scientists. In a few countries the undifferentiated pat- tern has survived until quite recently, at least in some fields of medicine. The proposition of the role of the outsider can be applied to this development as fol- lows: The range of practical problems which force themselves upon "practitioners" is, at any moment, infinitely varied. The range of scientific problems, on the other hand, is largely confined within the theoretical boundaries of the scientific disciplines. Spe- cialized research personnel working in au- tonomous and affluent scientific organiza- tions, which can determine their policies without paying attention to practical de- mands, may be, therefore, the most efficient agents in promoting rapid scientific growth in a period-but only in a period-when a good idea is at hand of how to explore a series of well-defined phenomena. In such periods there is great advantage in concen- trating upon those phenomena rather than dispersing resources on problems which may be unsoluble by the existing methods. But in the long run the returns in knowl- edge which can be gained from the increas- ingly precise investigation of a limited range of problems may be diminishing. Continu- ous productivity can follow then only from shifting the focus of attention to new prob- lems and developing adequate methods of investigating them. Practice in such times is an invaluable guide in locating relevant problems-rather than finding illusory ones, which happened not infrequently in the his- tory of academic thinking-and in adapting existing methods or devising new ones. Its problems are always real, and it usually pos- sesses a tradition which is the result of a long collective process of trial and error and which may suggest the way toward new the- ory and new methods. Similar arguments can be put forward in favor of training and keeping scientists in- terested in a broad variety of scientific and perhaps also humanistic disciplines, as against specialization in a relatively narrow ' As noted by Gilfillan, most outsiders mentioned in the literature of technical invention were, in fact, relative outsiders only, with various con- nections with the fields in which they eventually made their discoveries.</page><page sequence="3">ROLES AND INNOVATIONS IN MEDICINE 559 field. However, the social conditions deter- mining the relationship between research and practice are different from those deter- mining the degree of specialization. In this paper, therefore, we shall restrict ourselves to the exploration of the first of these two problems, namely, the effects of medical practice on research. First, we shall investigate the relationship between scientific and practical roles in countries where the differentiation of these roles has occurred on a considerable scale to see the extent of the opportunities for practitioner research and the kind of com- munication between those in the two roles. Then we shall analyze the reception of a type of innovation which proved fruitful in the long run but in which there was good reason a priori to expect initial lack of in- terest, even hostility, among professional scientists, because it implied a fundamental- ly different view of illness than that scien- tifically accepted and because the new view was at first established by standards scien- tifically not quite acceptable. If our reason- ing is valid-that influences coming from practice direct research to significant prob- lems not implied in the existing scientific theory and methodology-then the influ- ence will certainly show in this type of innovation. The old system whereby medical practi- tioners conducted their own research and created organizations which contributed to the advancement of science still existed in Germany in the sixties and seventies of the last century.5 But it had begun to decline as early as the forties. The fast development of the medical sciences created a paradoxical situation, since, in the state of knowledge at the time, the only thing one could do with good conscience was research, the accepted cures of the practicing profession having been shown to lack scientific foundation. Thus a cleavage arose between those who regarded themselves as medical scientists and those who practiced medicine. The spirit prevailing among the former is re- flected in the opinion of the director of a public hospital in 1845: "Just as our pre- cursors were more concerned with the suc- cess of their cures, so are we more concerned with our inquiries. Our purpose, therefore, is a purely scientific one. Medicine is a sci- ence, not an art."6 In spite of the limited use of medical sci- ence, there soon came into being a profes- sion of medical scientists who, within a short space of time, monopolized not only the medical faculties but, as a matter of fact, the public hospitals too.7 Thus practitioners gradually lost all access to facilities-labo- ratories and hospitals-necessary for re- search, while, owing to technical advance, facilities even for clinical research became increasingly elaborate. This development had been paralleled by a decrease in the opportunity for meaning- ful communication between the two sectors of the profession. Around the middle of the century, when the monopolization of the academic and hospital facilities and posi- tions by the scientists in the profession were already far advanced, the yearly meetings of the natural scientists and physicians-the Naturforscherversammlungen-still played an important role in German scientific life. Out of these assemblies arose the German medical association in the seventies, which was a much more narrowly professional af- fair, mainly of practitioners alone. Finally, at the turn of the century, there came into being a new association of medical practi- tioners, overwhelmingly absorbed in "union- ist" activities designed to better the eco- nomic status of the profession.8 The staffs of medical faculties and public hospitals 6 p.

The decisive steps toward the establishment of proper scientific facili- ties were taken around 1890 when it became apparent that medical research could greatly benefit therapy (i.e., after the great bacteri- ological discoveries), and the innovations were designed to benefit practice as well as research. The balanced development of the up-to-date facilities in the large American research hospitals differs from the develop- ment in Germany, where there may be ex- cellent facilities, such as a laboratory in the field of special interest of a head of a department, but where the facilities for the treatment of most patients may be, as a rule, quite modest.'0 As a result, no type of important facilities came to be monopolized by the full-time scientific professionals. Some practitioners continue teaching part time in medical schools, and, more impor- tant, an increasing number of them have access to first-class hospital and laboratory facilities." Practitioners as well as full-time research personnel have remained members of the same professional organization which has played an active part in the academic and research policies of the medical schools as well as in defending the material interests of doctors. Organizational unity among all the sectors of the medical profession has often been accompanied by tension, but there is no doubt that the professional or- ganization has provided an efficient means of communication between practitioners and scientists-in both directions.'2 Activities of the organization, such as the medical con- ventions, have preserved the kind of sym- bolical significance and spectacularity for the public as well as the profession as the Naturforscherversammlungen had in Ger- many around the middle of the last century. A further reason why the American sci- entific system is more open to pressures coming from practitioners or even the public at large (though the public would not ordi- narily take a stand in matters concerning science) is largely due to the scientific ad- ministrator, who is usually a man who had acquired an academic standing and then left it for full-time academic administration. Administrative tasks make it imperative for him to be practical, especially in the United States, where pressure groups are powerful. On the other hand, he possesses a sufficient understanding of the nature and require- ments of research and identifies himself mainly with the scientific profession. This makes it possible, at least in principle, for him to be a link between research and prac- tice.13 (In Germany, in spite of individual exceptions, this role has not developed. Ad- ministration and scientific leadership were kept strictly apart. There were two separate roles, the Kurator, an administrator ap- 'Final Report of the Commission on Medical Education (New York, 1932), p. 344. '0 A.

'1 This situation is the result of constant and often open conflict between various sectors of the profession rather than of generally accepted pol- icies. The conflict has usually centered around full- time clinical appointments in teaching hospitals, which, had they become the general rule, might have created a situation similar to that in Germany (Flexner, Medical Education in the United States and Canada, p. 278; cf.

In the training of student physicians, the Ger- man faculties defined their task as providing an introduction into the science of medicine; most practical knowledge was supposedly acquired in practice. On the other hand, American medical schools-even the most research-oriented-undertake to teach the student how to practice, making considera- ble effort to approach eminently practical problems in a systematic fashion rather than to delimit science authoritatively from prac- tice.'5 Thus the definition of the roles of people engaged in medical research had undergone the following changes during the late nine- teenth and early twentieth centuries. In Germany research and teaching became an entirely separate role from practice by the end of the nineteenth century. About the same time began the differentiation of re- search roles from practice in the United States and Britain, but in the latter the de- velopment had been limited to the basic medical sciences. This role differentiation led in Germany to the deprivation of the practitioners from all the facilities necessary for research and to a lowering of the status of the practitioners as compared with the scientists. None of these results followed the large-scale development of medical re- search roles in America. Finally, in Britain and even more in France, the early-nine- teenth-century type practitioner-scientist had predominated until quite recently. We have to see now whether scientists acting in these different roles displayed dif- ferent attitudes to the innovations we are interested in, namely, where there is good reason to expect that interest in practice played an important role in the discovery. To repeat, the innovations involve a funda- mentally different view of the investigated phenomenon-illness-from the view scien- tifically accepted; they are fruitful in the long run but are established in a way not quite acceptable by the standards of scien- tific methodology. Perhaps one could distin- guish these as "fundamental marginal inno- vations." Two instances of these aroused a long controversy, international in scope, so that the material relating to them is suffi- cient to show the alignment of various posi- tions and differences in the nature of contri- butions: the beginnings of bacteriology and psychoanalysis. A great deal of what was to constitute the bacteriological view of illness had been for a long time part and parcel of the medi- cal tradition. The idea of contagion goes back to antiquity, and so does the practice of inoculation; even the idea of contagium animatum had been put forward in the sev- enteenth century.'6 But the great advances in pathological and physiological studies of illness, from the beginning of the century, lent no scientific foundation or support to the bacteriological view. The theoretical analysis of the requirements of bacteriologi- cal research by one of the leading anatomists of the age, Jacob Henle (1840), was re- garded, as a recent historian of medicine put it, as a "rear-guard action" in defense of a traditional approach to illness which had no scientific future.'7 Nevertheless, for more than ten years before the decisive experi- ments of Koch finally settled the question whether or not illness can be caused by spe- cific living agents transferred from one Der- 14 A.

Striking clinical evidence had come much earlier in the work of Sem- melweis, which, however, had been well-nigh forgotten. But interest in it was revived by the work of Lister and the laboratory experi- ments of Pasteur and other French scien- tists. Before the crucial experiments of Koch, however, they were open to other interpretations.18 At this time Germany was already lead- ing in medical research. Indeed, the first important clinical discovery in the field of bacteriology was made in Austria, and the clarification of the methodological require- ments for testing the new theory and some very pertinent research were done by Ger- man professors of medicine. Yet during all this time (roughly from the mid-forties to the mid-seventies of the last century) the majority of the academic profession in Ger- many stood aloof from bacteriology. They regarded it as a matter of minor importance and did their best to quench the enthusiasm of the practitioners for the discoveries of Lister-having succeeded previously in con- signing the work of Semmelweis virtually to oblivion. With few exceptions (Cohn, Klebs) all incentive for research during the sixties and early seventies came from France and Britain, where science was much less profes- sionalized, and from the German practition- ers, by one of whom, indeed, the crucial experiment was made.19 It was no coincidence that practitioners were more interested in this line of research than scientists. The increasingly refined pathological studies proved most satisfac- tory in helping the latter to understand ill- ness. The fact that they provided no means of curing illness might have been a sad con- clusion for the more humane among the doc- tors, but one which scientists bore-and spread-with heroic resignation worthy of a profession whose destiny was the Entzau- berunz of (removint the mavic from) the world. Besides, they preferred the negative views of Liebig, Hoppe-Seyler, Virchow, and other outstanding representatives of estab- lished academic disciplines, as against a new kind of theory which threatened to revive the discredited ideas of vitalism. Practition- ers, on the other hand, even though they had to submit intellectually to the scientific argument, could find little satisfaction in it. They turned eagerly, therefore, to the works of Pasteur and Lister and evinced more in- terest in them than in the scientifically more impeccable work of physiologists and pa- thologists. The crucial investigations of Koch, too, were connected with a practical problem: the causes of anthrax, which caused great damage in the district where he worked as medical officer. His experiments are considered classic examples of correct scientific method. Yet quite a few hypoth- eses crucial for the design of his experiments were derived not from the traditions of the scientific laboratories but from the every- day observations of the people about the climatic conditions under which the disease occurred.20 Problems of medical (and veterinarian and agricultural) practice thus had been important in the initiation of bacteriological research; originally, more interest was taken in it by practitioners than by professional scientists. Although only the early experi- ments of Koch took place entirely outside the academic framework (later he became the director of a research institute and a university professor), at least three of the most important discoveries took place under conditions marginally academic. Semmel- weis was unable to establish his case by the accepted rules of the academic game and was rejected by the Austrian academic pro- fession. Even discounting some of the leg- ends attached to this tragic figure, it seems that he was greatly motivated by the wish to help, which was at considerable variance with the crude form of "therapeutic nihil- ism" prevalent at that time in Vienna, and Diepgen, op. cit., Vol. II, No. 2, pp. 115-25.

For reasons connected with his career, he abruptly left his early work of great theoretical interest and aban- doned his self-image of pure scientist for that of a helper of the human race through science. This led him to the investigation of the phenomena of fermentation and preven- tion of diseases out of which emerged his discoveries.22 Lister worked in Britain, where there was no differentiation between academic medicine and medical practice. Villemin and Davaine also worked outside the academic framework. Among all the pioneers in bacteriology, only Klebs was a proper academic physician.23 Yet, in spite of their marginal positions in relation to the circles of authoritative science, their work -and Koch's as well-grew out of the aca- demic milieu. Semmelweis came from the Vienna clinical school; Pasteur's work is related to the Franco-German school of chemistry; Lister's work was a result of Pasteur's; and Koch's was the last link in a chain which started with Henle and in- cluded much important research as well as the clarification of methodological require- ments. Finally, once the decisive beginnings were made, the further development of the discipline was most efficiently pursued by the academic machinery of Germany. In assessing the contribution of practi- tioners to this field of inquiry, therefore, it seems that their importance in the early stage of bacteriological research was that they provided an alternative frame of ref- erence (or "reference group") to the scien- tific one. For one whose career is the ex- ploration of the question, "What can be known about illness?" the choice of bacteri- ology could not have seemed a very good risk at a time when it seemed almost im- possible to investigate bacteriological prob- lems in a methodologically satisfactory way. Besides, committing one's self to research in this field implied a conflict with the materi- alistic ideologies then prevailing in scientific circles. All these considerations mattered very little if one chose as one's frame of reference medical practice rather than science. In this case the question decisive for the choice of subject was, "What can be done about ill- ness?" and from this point of view bacteri- ological research looked more promising than either physiology or pathology. Besides, it must have been much easier for a practi- tioner, or for someone identifying himself with practitioners (in medicine, in industry, etc.), to disregard the professional ideolo- gies of the scientists which would have prej- udiced him against anything suspect as vi- talism. Thus, while some of the important early discoveries were made by academic scientists, those who committed themselves most to the bacteriological hypotheses were mostly practitioner-scientists of the old type. The central innovator, Pasteur, it is true, was a professional academic scientist, but at a certain stage of his career he was com- pelled to use his scientific talent for the so- lution of practical problems. From this point on, he consciously adopted the new role of what might be called today "applied scien- tist," in which the criteria of relevance and success were different from those accepted in the academic profession. This explains, too, why the practitioners as a group ac- 2' Garrison, op. cit., p. 436. Even as late as 1861 his book activated a new campaign against him in which Virchow participated (see A.

The only academic group proper which supported the bacteriological approach was the botanist (Dubos, op. cit., pp. 119-22). They obviously had an inter- est in a theory which used something from their discipline in the explanation of phenomena pre- viously attributed to chemical factors.</page><page sequence="8">564 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY cepted the new theories in opposition to the view of the academic profession. All this tends to support the hypothesis that practice plays an important and system- atic role in the orientation of research to- ward new problems. Psychoanalysis pro- vides additional confirmatory evidence. Before Freud started his investigations of the neuroses, he was a scholar engaged in the kind of medical research that was the usual preparation for an academic career in German and Austrian medicine.24 The in- fluences which turned his interests into new directions were his studies with French cli- nicians; later, after he had to renounce his academic plans, his association with a well- known Viennese Hausarzt (family practi- tioner), Breuer; and, finally, his own private practice.25 There he encountered neuroses which were either unknown to or neglected by academic medicine. He approached these phenomena with the mental habits of a per- son trained in scientific research. Like the great French clinicians early in the century, when he found the existing methods of treatment useless and the defini- tions of mental illness irrelevant to his cases, he started to make painstaking clinical ob- servations, keeping his eyes open to things that were usually considered irrelevant and abandoning methods and theories (includ- ing, at the beginning, his own) when contra- dicted by evidence.26 In this way, his atten- tion was directed to phenomena which were all known to practicing doctors as part of the "art" or the etiquette of medicine but not systematically thought of as etiological in the causation and the therapy of illness. This is obvious in such key concepts of psy- choanalytic therapy as transference and counter transference, which are descriptions of what goes on between doctor and patient in many kinds of treatment and not only in psychotherapy. And, as pointed out by Par- sons, many elements of the medical etiquette have come to be used as technical tools of psychoanalysis.27 Such things are the rela- tionship of trust between doctor and patient (both ways), the handling of uncertainty, and the insistence on the autonomy of the patient and on his will to be cured. Even fee for service has been treated in psycho- analysis as a technical problem of therapy.28 This exposition may seem to emphasize unduly the method of psychoanalysis at the expense of its more controversial substan- tive hypotheses about sexual development. There was a great deal of non-scientific element in Freud's thinking and declara- tions about sex; like D. H. Lawrence in England, he regarded it as his mission to destroy all the mystery, shame, and guilt surrounding it. But such prophetic overtones were not unusual among nineteenth-century scientists, and-at least in the early writ- ings of Freud-they are not difficult to sep- arate from the scientific elements of his work.29 The latter consisted of the system- atic clinical description and analysis of neuroses and the search for a positive bio- logical basis of these elusive mental phe- nomena. Even his emphasis on pregenital sexuality was, to a large extent, an attempt to apply the developmental concepts of em- 24 On Freud's early scientific career see E. Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (London, 1955), Vol. I, chaps. v-vi, x. 'Ibid., chap. xi; S. Freud, An Autobiographical Study (London, 1935). The most perceptive sum- mary of these influences is Philip Rieff, Freud: The Mind of a Moralist (New York: Viking Press, 1959). ' Freud, op. cit., pp. 26-27, 58, 60-62, 109-10. 'T.

Erikson, Childhood and Society (London, n.d.), pp. 58-59. It has been correctly emphasized by Rieff (op. cit.) that, even in his "prophetic" role, Freud tried to behave much more like a scientist than did Virchow or Pasteur. Freud always shunned dramatic effect and popular ap- peal. But, of course, this might have been due partly to his greater insecurity about his status as a scientist.</page><page sequence="9">ROLES AND INNOVATIONS IN MEDICINE 565 bryology to the explanation of complex hu- man behavior.80 If this interpretation of the beginnings of psychoanalysis is correct, it justifies quoting it as a parallel to bacteriology. Psychoanaly- sis, too, was a novel theory of illness con- taining, however, traditional elements of medical thinking and practice. As a theory it was even more suspect than bacteriology. Scientific opposition to the latter was largely to the reintroduction of elements reminis- cent of vitalism while psychoanalytic con- cepts were frankly anthropomorphic and to some extent voluntaristic. To this extent it was justifiable to see it as something akin to prescientific medical thinking. The methodological problems raised by psychoanalysis also looked hopeless (again, not unlike but even more than in the case of bacteriology). True, it was a striking ap- plication of rigorous clinical thinking to new phenomena; but by that time clinical methods were increasingly replaced, or sup- plemented by laboratory research, and no one envisaged the possibility of this kind of research in psychoanalysis, although, in the beginning at least, Freud was confident that eventually a physiological basis of his the- ories would be found.3' Few people would doubt nowadays that all these objections to psychoanalysis were correct. But the objections of Liebig and Virchow to Pasteur's work also proved to be correct in the long run. Yet in both in- stances scientific and practical progress was achieved for some time by less than perfect methodology.32 On these grounds one feels justified in classifying psychoanalysis in the same category as bacteriology as a funda- mental marginal innovation. Let us now turn to the social structure of the process of innovation and of the reaction of academic circles to it. Important elements of the innovation came from academically less developed, more anarchic France, where there were no qualms about using the ill- understood but for many purposes useful method of hypnosis. Freud himself came from German academic medicine, but he had to renounce his academic career for practice. He was interested in research and had to abandon his scientific career because of a combination of lack of opportunity, inadequate means, and insufficient success, owing probably to a limited talent for exact research.38 Going into practice was a come- down for him; besides, he was not attracted to the role of the healer ("Aus fruehen Jahren ist mir nichts von einem Beduerfnis, leidenden Menschen zu helfen, bekannt.... Ich habe auch niemals 'Doktor' gespielt").34 Having to become a practicing doctor, there- fore, threatened his self-identity. He solved this problem by turning the searchlight of research on the neuroses specific to private practice and by making scientific techniques of various elements of the traditional heal- ing role which repelled him. There were, then, differences in the moti- vation of Freud, on the one hand, and the pioneers of bacteriology, especially Pasteur, on the other hand. Freud wanted to prove that he was a scientist, though engaged in practice; Pasteur wanted to prove that he, as a scientist, could make decisive contribu- tion to the solution of practical problems. But the social situations out of which the innovations emerged were similar. In both cases there were phenomena which presented practical problems but were not promising in the mind of the person whose aim was to find out what could be known about illness; in both cases the innovation was the result of applying systematic scientific thinking to these phenomena as well as to the traditions existing about them among those accus- tomed to deal with them. Finally, in both cases those whose work to some extent led " Apart from Freud's own writings, especially the earlier ones, see Erikson, op. cit., pp. 59-61; J.

Now they had to choose their problems according to the criterion of "something to be done" rather than the accepted scientific criteria of their times. This process whereby a person in Role A is set to achieve the aims of Role B can be described as "role hybridization." The in- novation is the result of an attempt to apply the usual means in Role A to achieve the goals of Role B. Obviously, successful inno- vation is not the only possible outcome. The means of Role A may be irrelevant to the goals of Role B, or the relearning of Role B may be a more acceptable solution than the creating of a new combination out of the elements of the two roles. In our cases the means of the scientific role-exact observa- tion and isolation of factors through experi- ment or clinical reasoning-were relevant to the practical goals to which they were applied, and the definition of the situation created a problem which could not be solved, or not satisfactorily, by learning the other role as it then existed. Pasteur was expected to prove himself through practical results as a scientist; Freud, of course, could have become a practitioner, but this would have meant an admission of defeat on his part. He was interested in science and not inter- ested in practice; furthermore, in Austria and Germany at that time, when the status of the scientist was high, that of the prac- titioner relatively low, and the old role of practitioner-scientist almost extinct, to abandon the scientific career was also to lose status. Innovation, therefore, remained the only satisfactory solution. In Austria and Germany the new theory -psychoanalysis-was not taken seriously by the academic circles and was not given any opportunity in the universities. Criti- cism of it was often hostile and coarse; it was censured as immoral because of its sexual theories, and the psychoanalysts were at times boycotted, especially by univer- sities and public hospitals. Freud and his followers did their best to expose the nar- row-minded prejudice, stupidity, and, in some cases, dishonesty of their most virulent opponents.35 However, the opposition could not have been successful had psychoanalysis been recognized by at least part of the sci- entific public. The academic leadership of Germany did not consist of the people made ridiculous by the psychoanalysts, and, if the new theory was practically boycotted in German academic medicine, this hap- pened with the consent of quite a few un- prejudiced and brilliant people who were afraid of neither Jew (some were Jews them- selves) nor, one presumes, sex. Their be- havior was motivated by the fact that psy- choanalysis was bad science and that their definition of science was a strictly profes- sional one. Working where there was an organizational cleavage between practice and scientific research, they took no interest in a theory which had only practical achieve- ments and aesthetic appeal to commend it. In consequence, psychoanalysis was driv- en in Vienna-and, indeed, everywhere in Austria and Germany-very nearly into the position of a medical sect officially de- nounced at scientific meetings, instead of having been absorbed, transformed, and utilized to any great extent in psychological and psychiatric research and practice.86 At least this was the case until the 1920's. It is difficult to determine to what extent the exclusion of psychoanalysis from academic science for a period of about twenty years was due to its very grave shortcomings as a science or to the fact that by that time " Jones, op. cit., Vol. II, chap. iv; the official psychoanalytical view of the subject as stated by Freud was that opposition to psychoanalysis had emotional and not intellectual sources ("Die Wiederstaende gegen die Psychoanalyse," Gesam- melte Schriften, XIV, 108). 36Jones, op. cit., pp. 107-25; Freud, An Auto- biographical Study, pp. 87-101.</page><page sequence="11">ROLES AND INNOVATIONS IN MEDICINE 567 academic science, including academic med- icine, had become a much more closed sys- tem than it was at the time of the con- troversy over bacteriology. But the latter explanation is supported by the reception of psychoanalysis in the United States. Objections and doubts existed in American circles not less than in Germany; there were, moreover, attempts to suppress the new theory by official denunciations at sci- entific congresses, as in Germany, but with- out success. The new theories received the attention of some practitioners as well as of professors of medicine and psychology.37 This can be attributed partly to the fact that, from the point of view of the organi- zation and professionalization of science, the United States at the beginning of the twentieth century was in the same stage of development as was Germany in the 1850's and 1860's. The process had just started to gather momentum. However, if only the rudimentary stage of the organization and professionalization of science had been the cause of the different reception of psycho- analysis in the United States, one would expect opinion to be divided, as it was about bacteriology in Germany: support for the theory would have come from practitioners and opposition from academic scientists. But, as a matter of fact, the cleavage of opinions was never on these lines; much of the support came from academic circles. The scientific reference group in the United States was more open than in Germany, owing apparently to the institutional ar- rangements (as previously described), which provided a link between science and the groups interested in its application.38 This analysis of the beginnings of bac- teriology and psychoanalysis lends general support to the proposition that contact with practice may be important in reorienting re- search toward the investigation of new and fruitful problems. The practitioner-scien- tists appear as forerunners, supporters, and disciples in the history of two innovations, bacteriology and psychoanalysis, the central figures, in both were "role hybrids" who were led to the innovation by an abrupt change from theoretical research to applied science. The practitioner-scientist, as well as the role hybrid, each are in a position to shift frames of reference relatively easily. But it can be assumed that those whose training and main role is that of the "sci- entist" will be more capable of generalizing, and more motivated to generalize, their findings and establish themselves as innova- tors than the practitioner-scientists.89 This interpretation may be relevant to the eventual investigation of patterns of dis- covery resulting from shifts from one sci- entific discipline to the other. Scientific dis- ciplines differ from one another in the de- gree of their theoretical closure and method- ological precision. The phenomena most similar to role hybridization would be shifts from a theoretically and methodologically more advanced discipline to one less ad- vanced. These must be distinguished from shifts between two disciplines of the same level and from less to more advanced disciplines. As far as the organization of science is concerned, the seemingly paradoxical con- clusion is that professionalization of research does not in itself decrease the chances of innovations by outsiders.

Merton, "Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science," American Sociological Review, XXII (1957), 635-59. According to this, it can be assumed that professional scientists are more motivated than practitioner-scientists to innovation.</page><page sequence="12">568 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY fact, theoretically, it increases the chances, since, the more differentiated a field, the greater the likelihood of role hybridization in it. In practice, however, the differentiation of research from practice and the profes- sionalization of science may take place in such a way as to make it difficult for sci- entists to engage in marginal problems with- out endangering their status beyond the risk taken by every innovator. Where an aca- demic system reacts to marginal innova- tions, as the German system did to early bacteriology and, even more, to psycho- analysis, there is great risk in investigating problems considered irrelevant by academic authorities. It will be, therefore, relatively difficult to shift frames of reference. This is, indeed, shown in the relatively unimportant share of German academicians in establish- ing bacteriology as a science and in the fact that psychoanalysis developed into a move- ment rather than science in Austria and Germany. If this analysis is correct, one would ex- pect such "closed" academic systems as the German to lose efficiency because of their resistance to marginal innovations. This is, indeed, what happened to German academic medicine. On the other hand, this loss of efficiency may be temporary. Once the in- novation is sufficiently established in another system, it may be taken up by the closed one and developed there rapidly, as, in fact, happened to German bacteriology. At a later stage of the differentiation and professionalization of scientific roles mech- anisms arose which mediated between the two types of activity and apparently broke down the barrier to communication found between practice and research in the last decades of the nineteenth century. The kind of professional structure which emerged in the United States made possible the differ- entiation of scientific roles, yet prevented a cleavage between the outlook of the aca- demic and practicing sectors of the profes- sion. From this point of view medical "pro- fessionalism," which consciously aims at maintaining a balance between the develop- ment of medical sciences and practice, can be regarded as a sequel to the establishment of research as a separate institution during the nineteenth century. It is a social struc- ture, or, rather, one of the structures, since there are certainly more than one, which represents a phase of growing integration between science and practice following the differentiation of academic research in the medical field out of the context of amateur and practitioners' research during the last century. The spread of professionalization in an increasing number of disciplines sug- gests that the sequence of events observed in medicine may have its parallels in other fields.
