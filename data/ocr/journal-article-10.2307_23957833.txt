<plain_text><page sequence="1">Butler and Hume on Religion: A Comparative Analysis. By Anders Jeffner. Translated by K. Bradfield. Notes translated by J. Stewart. Pp. 266. (Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis. Studia Doc trinae Christianae Upsaliensis, no. 7.) Stockholm: Diakonis tyrelsens Bokforlag, 1966. 48 Kr. Butler and Hume, argues Dr. Jeffner, were in agreement about the proper method to be used in solving philosophical problems. For what Butler meant by reasoning from 'matters of fact' to probable conclu sions was substantially the same as what Hume described as 'the ex perimental method of reasoning'. Both men applied this method to human nature in psychology, and both inquired into the religious conclusions which can be reached when the method is applied to the world around us. The conclusions at which each arrived were, of course, very different. And the author makes it quite clear that in his opinion Hume gets the better of the argument. He maintains indeed, doubtless rightly, that the Cleanthes of Hume's Dialogues cannot be simply identified with Butler. But this does not alter the fact that the bishop's ideas are affected by Hume's criticism of contemporary theology. In Dr. Jeffner's opinion Hume succeeds in showing that the experimental method is unable to establish the teleological view of the universe which is an essential foundation of Butler's argument from analogy. More over, even if the validity of the argument is assumed, Hume then succeeds in confronting the theologian with the choice between embracing an anthropomorphism which would be religiously unsatis factory and interpreting the meaning of the terms predicated of God</page><page sequence="2">538 REVIEWS in such a way that they are evacuated of all content. In brief, 'as a criticism of contemporary theology, Hume's dialogues are devastating' (p. 209). The lesson to be learned from all this, according to the author, is not that no reasonable theology is possible but rather that Butler's pro gramme was ill-conceived, the programme, that is to say, of showing that religious truths are probably true by means of an extension of the type of argument used in empirical science. The real issue, as Dr. Jeffner sees it, is between different 'fundamental patterns', different metaphysical visions of the universe. Two people may agree about all the empirical facts and yet see the universe in different ways. As in the choice of a fundamental pattern a subjective element, a personal attitude, can never be entirely eliminated, there can be no purely im personal demonstration of the truth of one particular basic world-vision. But it by no means follows that no reasonable argument is possible. What is needed is an investigation into 'the rules that apply for the acceptance of fundamental patterns and for drawing conclusions from them' (p. 255). This doctorate dissertation is clear and well worked out. There are some interesting pages on what the author calls 'the Royal Society theologians' (p. 143) who influenced theological thought in England in the eighteenth century. And Dr. Jeffner drives home some good points, such as the need for distinguishing between Butler's use of the word 'analogy' and the use of the word by Aquinas, Browne, King, and others. As for the general point of view, it seems to me well argued and sensible, though perhaps too much is conceded to Hume. For example, the present reviewer is not so impressed by Hume on miracles as many people seem to be. However, many readers will probably feel, as I do myself, that the book can be regarded as a commentary on the opening words of Professor John Wisdom's famous essay on Gods, 'the existence of God is not an experimental issue in the way it was', provided at any rate that we decide to apply these words to eighteenth-century modes of thought. But these modes of thought are not ours today. The tendency now is to make a sharp distinction between science on the one hand and meta physical and religious beliefs on the other, rather than to assimilate them to one another. Hence, if we leave out of account the element of sober historical scholarship, which is obviously essential for a doctorate thesis, and look at the matter purely from the point of view of contem porary thought, it is not unreasonable to say that the main interest of the work is to be found in the final chapter, which looks forward to a further book dealing with such themes as 'fundamental patterns' and the nature and function of religious language. To put the matter in</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 539 another way, from the author's point of view the present work shows what, in his opinion, philosophical theology ought not to be. In the projected book he will explain the sort of thing which he thinks it ought to be. If Hume is here depicted as victor in a battle, this does not mean that according to the author we have to acquiesce in Hume's conclusion that in the sphere of religion the only proper attitude is doubt, un certainty, and suspension of judgement.
