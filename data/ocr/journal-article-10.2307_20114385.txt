<plain_text><page sequence="1">ERWIN W. FELLOWS SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE This paper is concerned with the influence of social and cultural factors on the development of science. It includes ideological, valuational, economic, demographic, and linguistic influences, as well as those deriving from social organization or structure. It is not concerned with (a) the internal development of science itself, as a cumulative body of proposi tions, (b) factors peculiar to the life history of individual scientists, or (c) the social and institutional structure of scientific activity. Two works have appeared in recent years which bear a close relationship to the approach used here: Bernard Barber, Science and the social order (Glencoe, Illinois: Free Press, 1952); and Gerard DeGr?, Science asa social institution (Garden City: Doubleday, 1955). In general, however, the types of ideas which constitute the content of this paper are to be found scattered through a wide variety of historical and sociological literature. The significance of a study of this kind may be seen in (a) its importance for increasing our knowledge of the relationship between systems of ideas and existential conditions, and (b) its applicability to the problem of how the development of knowledge may be furthered, or directed along desired paths - a problem of particular importance when there is fear of some of the applications of science and a desire to limit inquiry to 'safe' topics. It should be noted that science, as an impersonal, cumulative system of empirically based knowledge, is probably less influenced by factors external to the system than are other systems of ideas or other forms of intellectual activity. The reasons for this lower degree of susceptibility are to be found in the internal characteristics of scientific development: (a) the fact that any scientific achievement is based on previous work, so that the direction of work is determined, in part, by the existing state of knowledge; (b) the fact that scientific ideas are limited by the demand that they be consistent with the data of observation; (c) the fact that any given scientific theory must meet criteria of logical consistency. The influence 154</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES of social forms on thought is probably greatest in primitive society, where nature is viewed in categories largely derived from the social order. This kind of influence unquestionably declines as science advances. One additional note of qualification should be made. Investigating the conditions which influence any given type of activity is not to minimize the importance of that activity. Inquiry into the conditions influencing science tells nothing about the validity or utility of scientific statements and in no way detracts from the significance of scientific work. The statements which follow are based on a survey of the literature, particularly that of the history of science. They represent, then, observa tions which have been made, or ideas which have been suggested, by qualified investigators. The present writer makes no claim to originality for the ideas presented, nor has he tried to shape them into a consistent, integrated pattern. He would regard a few of the statements as quite unwarranted. His background is that of a sociologist. Any work in this field must build on the achievements of a number of historians of science (Sarton, Pledge, Singer, Crombie, Taylor, Shyrock, Sigerist, Wolf, Farrington, Mason); a number of scientists who have studied the social framework of some phase of scientific activity (Bernai, Crowther, Haldane, Bronowski, Levy, Hogben, Zilsel, Needham); and a number of social scientists, historians, and philosophers who have given attention to scientific behavior and institutions (Weber, Merton, H?rtung, Butterfield, Znaniecki, Mumford, Stern, Sorokin, Mannheim, Durkheim, Barber, DeGr?, Childs, Whitehead). To these incomplete lists might be added a considerable number who have dwelt upon the relationship be tween science and such other cultural products as art and religion. No attempt at documentation is made in this introductory outline. Occa sionally, when a suggestion is particularly associated with some person, his name is mentioned. The types of existential factors which may be related to science are here classified under eight major headings. The last of these is largely a residual category. The examples listed in each class should be regarded, in most cases, as hypotheses for investigation, rather than statements of relation ships which have already been established. It may not be easy, in many cases, to determine the direction of causality in these relationships. They may often be reciprocal. It may never be possible to describe these relationships with any high degree of certainty, for the historical data are 155</page><page sequence="3">ERWIN W. FELLOWS difficult to obtain and the continuing development of science tends to reduce the effect of these extra-scientific influences. The effects of science on behavior and social organization have been often studied ; the concern here is with the effects on science of other forms of human behavior. A. IDEOLOGICAL By 'ideological' we refer to those influences which originate in other (non scientific) intellectual systems, particularly religion, philosophy, and logic, but including also less sophisticated folk systems of belief. (1) The axioms of thought in a culture will have an effect on the forms in which questions are stated and the types of answers which are regarded as constituting a solution to a problem. The axioms also serve to define the model of truth which serves as a standard for the formulation of thought and helps determine the validity of such systems, in terms of their structural or formal resemblance to this model. Examples: If the axioms of thought include beliefs or statements about cause and effect, as they seem to do in most and perhaps all cultures, investigation will tend to be formulated in those terms and the most satisfactory kind of answer will be that which describes a 'cause' for the object of interest. In the early medieval period, a satisfactory explanation was one that showed the phenomenon to be a symbol of something else which was not directly observable (an outlook unfavorable to science). In the medieval period, too, analogy was often accepted as proof. Basically, the process of scientific explanation consists of relating a phenomenon to a system of general statements. For most of the history of modern science, an explanation in mechanical terms has been found most satisfactory. (2) Metaphysical beliefs - beliefs about the 'ultimate' nature of the world - may have an important influence on scientific activity. If the world is merely a transitional state before one enters upon a completely different life, the general effect would be discouragement of inquiry into that 'transitional' world. If the universe is regarded as consisting of unrelated (or fortuitously related) events, investigation may be discouraged or directed at attempted 'magical' manipulation of these events or the forces assumed to be behind them. If the world is regarded as a harmonious, orderly pattern, there will be attempts to discover that pattern (unless it is assumed to be already known). 156</page><page sequence="4">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES Whether the content of modern science is based on a previously existing system of (materialistic) metaphysics or, on the other hand, its basic formulations were developed internally, from the nature of its own operations and procedures, is a matter of some dispute. There is little doubt that the metaphysics of Plato, with its assertion of the superior reality of ideal absolutes and its advocacy of myth, was an obstacle to empirical science, although not to mathematics. As an instance of the possible effect of a more specific belief, we might cite the fact that the conception of the earth as a flat surface may have hindered the develop ment of non-Euclidean forms of geometry. The basic scientific practice of empirical testing is congenial with pragmatist philosophy, though it is doubtful whether the philosophical formulation had much influence on scientific development. (3) The existence of a single, monolithic, all-encompassing ideology is probably unfavorable to scientific development. Curiosity and inquiry are more likely to be stimulated by the presence of divergent or conflicting sets of ideas. (4) A belief that the world is changing or modifiable is likely to promote that kind of scientific inquiry which is motivated (as much science has undoubtedly been) by a desire to improve the conditions of life or to control the process of events. A belief in a static world may offer few obstacles to astronomy and to those aspects of science whose basic concepts and goals are capable of being readily defined in static mathematical terms. (5) Among possible more detailed relationships which have been suggest ed by historians of science may be mentioned the following: (a) The Greek philosophy of a fixed, finite, perfect universe and immovable earth contributed to their neglect of the study of motion and dynamics. (b) Greek philosophy and geometry have been described as based on tactile-muscular methods of perception, rather than visual (Ivins). (c) The scholastic emphasis on 'substance' supported a scientific emphasis on object or content to a neglect of process, (d) Muslim interest in the study of the Koran led to the sciences of philology, lexicography, and law, but the accompanying emphasis on tradition and 'the word' was basically unfavorable to science, (e) Buddhist theology, while emphasizing logic and reason, apparently hindered scientific advance by its philosophy that the natural world, including human society, was an evil, to be totally avoided, (f) In India, medicine and physiology were influenced 157</page><page sequence="5">ERWIN W. FELLOWS by interest in yoga and mystical experience, while the phonetic study necessary for reciting the Vedas was a stimulus to acoustics, (g) Progress in optics during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries was stimulated by the idea of 'light' in Christian theology (Crombie). (h) German belief in a 'race mind' led to German scientific V?lkerpsychologie, (i) German preoccupation with history led to a concentration on development and process in science, and specifically to early achievement in embryology, (j) Mason suggests connections between biological theory and cultural ideology: the Darwinian idea of related species progressing by competi tion with laissez-faire theories of progress in England; the Lamarckian view of related species progressing by inner forces and inherited additions from environment with a psychological and sociological doctrine of progress in France; and the nature-philosophers' view of species as unconnected material realizations of stages of World Spirit with the German preoccupation with history and the mystical-alchemical tradition, (k) The existence of dichotomies, trichotomies, sacred numbers, etc., common in nearly all cultures, has doubtless influenced scientific theories - usually adversely. (6) The general effect of Christianity on the development of science is a matter of considerable dispute. Some specific points are listed elsewhere. White was of the opinion that Christianity hindered scientific progress for over 1500 years. Its attempts to stamp out magic operated to discour age any form of physical inquiry. As an ethical system, Christianity, with its emphasis on respect for life, healing the sick, and being at least charitable towards the poor, contributed to the development of sciences, particularly medical, promoting those ends. This emphasis has often been in conflict with a stress on death and a denial of the importance of life in 'this' world, which has had a contrary effect. The relative importance of these emphases has varied historically. The practice of logical manipula tion, so highly developed by medieval theologians, is sometimes regarded as preparing for scientific advance; but it may also be taken as a diversion of attention from previously existing inquiry into nature, which was really just as 'logical' but had the added virtue (from a scientific stand point) of an empirical basis. It may be, as Sarton suggested, that scholastic ism is a necessary stage in man's intellectual development, from which only Western civilization emerged successfully by finding the experimental method. It appears that, during the rise of modern science, the more 158</page><page sequence="6">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES mystical varieties of Christianity were at least less unfavorable to science than was the orthodox, rationalistic scholasticism, especially in that the latter opposed physical experimentation by regarding it as a form of magic. There can be no doubt of many severe restrictions placed by Christian churches on the subject matter of scientific inquiry and the dissemination of scientific ideas. A few students, however, (e.g., Mary Hesse) have tried to maintain that modern science developed by rejecting Greek ideas and utilizing the 'true' Christian heritage.1 (7) The concept of natural law was derived in part from the idea of divine law governing the universe, developed by the Babylonians and Hebrews, and the idea of statute law (in contrast with administrative regulation). Statute law, in turn, required a centralized political organiza tion. Belief in the metaphysically necessary character of natural law (now largely abandoned) stems in large measure from the first component mentioned, divine law. The development of statute law in the late medieval period also promoted scientific development by weakening the intellectual dominance of theology. The primary component of natural law, however - the idea that the universe is patterned - is a Greek contribution, although also developed by the Chinese. It has been maintained by some that the idea of a personal law-giver for the universe was a necessary antecedent to the idea of natural law. B. SOCIAL STRUCTURE 'Social structure' refers here to the divisions existing within a society, the patterns of communication among and within such divisions, the method and frequency of changing from one division to another, and the types of organization which relate persons to one another and serve !) It should perhaps be noted that conceptions of medieval European science have been modified in recent years. At the present time there is a considerable measure of disagreement on the nature and achievements of scientific thought during that period. Perhaps it would be fairest to say, in a summary of this sort, that (a) there were definite scientific achievements between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries ; (b) these achieve ments influenced the more spectacular achievements of the seventeenth century scientific revolution; (c) the earlier progress tended to be in the form of isolated achievements, neither any social organization of scientists nor any general scientific outlook having developed; (d) much of the scientific interest ofthat time was stimulated by contact with Arabic culture; (e) technological progress was made in Europe during the medieval period, but generally without much connection with theoretical inquiry. 159</page><page sequence="7">ERWIN W. FELLOWS to order their interpersonal behavior. 'Divisions' include those commonly denoted in such terms as social class, caste, status, occupation, and social groups. (1) There is considerable evidence that a class structure with sharply differentiated functions between classes and lack of communication between classes may hinder scientific achievement. Thus, the existence of a slave labor class in ancient Greece, performing manual work which was negatively valued by a clearly separated citizen class in which were included the practitioners of intellectual activity, has often been cited as a primary limiting factor in the development of Greek science (Farrington). A similar division operated through the Middle Ages, with one social stratum of educated men who had a near monopoly of intellectual activity, and another of uneducated (although respected), craftsmen who did much of any experimental and technological work that was done. The American South, especially in the nineteenth century, might be described in similar terms. Among the more detailed studies in this field are those by Zilsel. (2) Historically, a politically powerful merchant class has been the chief instrument for combining intellectual and manual activity. The failure of such a class to develop in China has been the chief factor hindering the development of modern science and technology in that culture (Needham). In Greece, science was the product of the first 'citizens', as Farrington puts it - men who felt responsible for their society and tried to explain it. (3) The distinction between pure and applied science may be derived from a class structure where 'pure' science is a function of a leisure class (serving as a symbol of leisure because of its lack of utilitarian applica tion). 'Leisure class science' is probably limited as to both subject matter and methods of inquiry. (4) Restrictions on mobility or on opportunity to change from one class, occupation, or other group to another will tend to limit scientific advance by limiting the opportunity of some to obtain education or to practice an occupation for which they are qualified. (5) Restrictions on communication between the constituent groups of society inhibit scientific development, because of the interdependence of scientists in developing an impersonal body of knowledge. The secrecy with which craftsmen have often surrounded their occupational know 160</page><page sequence="8">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES ledge has hindered technological progress. Objectivity is achieved by cooperative social relationships among scientists, which permit public testing and correcting of ideas; the promotion of cooperative interaction in the larger society may promote scientific advance. One suggested reason for the limited development of Greek science is its lack of cooper ative relationships among scholars, who were usually isolated individuals (Edelstein). (6) The strong dominance of any one institution (political, economic, religious, familial) in directing behavior and defining correct behavior may limit scientific advance by discouraging doubt and inquiry. This may have been the case with the church in medieval Europe, the family in China, political institutions in Rome, and economic institutions in modern Western civilization. Such a generalization would need to be modified to the extent that the dominant institution deliberately encour aged research and investigation. The absence of a strong priesthood or centralized bureaucracy in Greece has sometimes been cited as a condition permitting an unusual amount of free inquiry. In general, the uses to which scientific knowledge is put are decided by the dominant groups of society. (7) A social structure which allows a high degree of freedom of organiza tion, association, occupation, inquiry, and expression will be favorable to scientific development. (8) Much of modern science has been closely connected with attempts at reform and improvement of social structure. Perhaps this is most obvious in the history of sociology, but melioristic or Utopian motives have been important in many fields of science since the seventeenth century. On the other hand, contemporary preoccupation in sociology with problems of social class and public opinion (including attitudes, market research, mass communication) reflects the values and problems of a class-structured society in which status is important but uncertain, and in which much effort is devoted to the shaping and changing of patterns of behavior. Periods of revolution seem to be unfavorable for scientific activity, although the consequences of some revolutions (e.g., the French) may include social conditions auspicious for science. (9) In an equalitarian society, agreement must be reached by persuasion rather than authority. Such a condition is favorable to science. (10) The fact that law (jurisprudence) remained part of theology in 161</page><page sequence="9">ERWIN W. FELLOWS Hebrew and Muslim cultures hindered legal reform and thought. Their separation, both in content and occupationally, in Christian Europe restricted the role of theology in social control and facilitated intellectual advance (Sarton). As mentioned above, the concept of natural law was influenced by the idea and functioning of statute law, which developed where there were centralized political institutions. (11) In slave and feudal society, where social organization is hierarchical, theories of the universe and of nature show a hierarchical content. Cartesian rationalism may be seen as parallel to the political absolutism of the time. Bourgeois society, it has been suggested, is reflected in scientific theories of (a) the quantitative identity of material things and (b) mechan ical causality, with a separate spiritual realm. Contemporary theories of organism and holism are sometimes regarded as related to increasing social interdependence and collectivism. Needham says that the 'or ganism' idea characteristic of Chinese science is an expression of the bureaucratic structure of Chinese society. Sociological positivism has sometimes been analyzed as an ally of fascism. (12) There may be a basic and to some extent inescapable conflict between the stability and routine necessary for a functioning social system and the constant change produced by scientific activity (Darling ton). (13) If a scientific law is a recipe for doing something, which is validated in action, science would be expected to thrive in a society which permits the testing of theory in industry or in social conduct (Dewey; Hogben). (14) Where social control is based on the use of myth and falsehood, the development of science is seriously limited. This is one factor in the stunted development of science in Greece and Rome (Farington). C. VALUATIONAL Since the values of a society find expression in ideology, this category overlaps with the first one. (1) In general, one would expect scientific activity to be furthered by the placing of a high value on the following: (a) Truth (as opposed to authority or persuasion) (b) Logic (as opposed to tradition) (c) 'This world' (rather than another) 162</page><page sequence="10">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES (d) A secular attitude, regarding the world as natural (in contrast with a sacred attitude, regarding the world or some part of it as somehow non-natural or supernatural). (2) Science might be hindered by the placing of a high value on symbols as such - since, for science, symbols serve as means for the ordering of events, without intrinsic value of their own. (3) The values assigned to various occupations will affect the numbers attracted to those occupations and the importance attached to their work. High status for an occupation does not necessarily contribute to the productivity of that occupation, however, especially if high status means avoiding manual work, as it sometimes did for the Greek scientist and usually did for the medieval physician. Preoccupation with status, as Crowther puts it, is inimical to objective inquiry. (4) Roman rhetoric and stoicism contributed to a lack of interest in science. The traditional values of southern United States (social, military, esthetic) may have led Southerners to become writers, military figures, and mathematicians. Dominant values in South America (religious, rhetorical) have led the educated aristocracy into priesthood, law, and literature. Doubtless similar statements could be made about Chinese, Hindu, and Arabic cultures, though generalizations of this type easily become tautologies. (5) The direction of inquiry within science is, of course, influenced by the value assigned to various aspects of experience and various kinds of problems. Thus, American interest in physically mastering a continent led to an emphasis on applied, 'practical' science, at the expense of basic theory. The high degree of development of economics, among the social sciences, may reflect a cultural preoccupation with economic values and behavior. (6) Sociologists of science have given particular attention to the role of Protestantism in providing a system of values and an intellectual atmos phere conducive to the development of science. Merton's study of Puritanism in seventeenth-century England is the most thorough. Puritanism expressed newly-dominant cultural values in which useful work, occupational diligence, education, and reason were praised, and these both encouraged and justified scientific activity. They also promoted the capitalistic economic developments of the time. The prestige of science, especially in its technological and applied aspects, was greatly 163</page><page sequence="11">ERWIN W. FELLOWS increased. The fact that the emphasis on 'good works' of Protestantism often took a scientific direction is probably a result of the combination of many circumstances rather than any close affinity between this type of religious belief and a scientific attitude. Although conflicts later arose between Protestantism and science (especially over theories of evolution in the nineteenth century), a scientific calling still appears to have a greater attraction for Protestants than for Catholics. It should be noted that there was a marked increase in scientific activity in Catholic Europe both before and after the Reformation. (7) The relationship between values expressed in political ideology and the content of science is most obviously illustrated in totalitarian societies: the Russian environmentalist tendency in genetics, because of its consist ency with Marxist ideology; German racist theories during the fascist era. The relationship may also be noted elsewhere: a correlation, in British and American scientists, between environmentalism and liberalism and between 'hereditarianism' and conservatism. Probably these connec tions are most marked in the social sciences. The early democratic movement hindered medicine by allowing anyone to practice. Laissez faire principles were in conflict with engineering and public health practices. (8) The growth of humanitarian feeling in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, achieving one form of expression in the revolutionary move ments of the time, was an important stimulus to medicine, biology, and interest in public health and safety which in turn contributed to technol ogical developments. On the other hand, opposition to experimenting on humans may have slowed medical advance. (9) Greek achievements in medicine may have been influenced by the cultural emphasis on physical fitness, health, and gymnastics. (10) The methods used in scientific research may be influenced by cultural values: the European preference for historical methods, the American for surveys and data-gathering. D. ECONOMIC By 'economic' we refer to the social organization devoted to the produc tion and distribution of goods and services. (1) The development of trade and industry provided a stimulus to the 164</page><page sequence="12">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES early modern development of science, especially as the latter could be applied in navigation, mining, military uses, and (to some extent) manufacturing processes. (2) The tendency for commercial development to foster standardization of measures and quantitative ways of thinking is a favorable condition for science. Specifically, Lilley has suggested that interest in quantitative aspects of energy changes among nineteenth century industrialists contributed to formulation of the idea of conservation of energy. (3) An economy characterized by a rapid accumulation of capital and a high degree of division of labor provides conditions favorable for science. (4) The existence of a substantial amount of leisure time (i.e., time not devoted to caring for biological necessities) is one essential condition for scientific development; it is in turn dependent on an economic base. (5) A high rate of obsolescence may create opportunities for invention and so stimulate some practical applications of science. (6) The existence of a property interest in inventions may stimulate that particular kind of activity, depending on whether the effect of incentive offered by property interest is offset by the opportunity for restriction of development and communication which it also offers. (7) There may be a relationship between competitiveness in economic behavior and individualism in thinking, but the relationship is probably not close. People most closely involved in competitive economic processes do not seem to exhibit greater originality in thinking than those farther removed from it. (8) The relative value of various methods of financing scientific activity (as a function of educational institutions, government, business, founda tions) has been little investigated. Good results can be cited for all of them. Support from government or business may restrict the range of scientific activity to the obviously practical. It has been maintained that the organization and tradition of universities hinder the development of social science by directing attention away from 'value problems' and by a desire to avoid criticism and non-conformity. (9) Marxist theory regards science as part of the ideological superstruc ture of society, whose basic characteristics are determined by the means of production. This view has been fruitful in calling attention to specific relationships, although most historians regard it as exaggerated and one-sided. In extreme form, it has led to denunciation of the indeter 165</page><page sequence="13">ERWIN W. FELLOWS minacy principle, Mendelian genetics, and psycho-analysis as 'bourgeois' concepts, invalidated by the inadequacy of their economic base. (10) A short supply of labor favors the adoption of new technological practices, as illustrated by the early rapid adoption of agricultural inventions in the United States. (11) The development of political economy (14th to 17th centuries) originated in financial problems created by increased trade and production. The present well-developed state of economics, in contrast with other social sciences, may be due to a high cultural evaluation of economic values and behavior. (12) Periods of economic prosperity and expansion are periods of interest in natural sciences and technology. In times of social disorganiza tion, interest turns to psychology and ethics (Franz Alexander). (13) Trade in goods, being accompanied by trade in ideas, is a stimulant to scientific enterprise. E. INTERCULTURAL (1) In common with other forms of intellectual activity, science seems to flourish in the stimulating atmosphere of contact with other and different cultures and to languish in isolation. The conditions of contact will affect the degree of stimulation, and factors internal to the society will of course operate under all conditions. (2) Examples : limited contact between the Arabic and European worlds prevented full utilization by the West of the discoveries of Arabic science; Greek science benefited from Middle Eastern contacts; science in Japan advanced following contact with Chinese and European cultures; lack of contact between America and Europe hindered the early development of American science ; the isolation of ancient China hindered science in a culture that was highly advanced in some respects. (3) The special form of intercultural contact known as war has been the subject of considerable study, so far as its relationship to science is concerned. The relationship is not a simple one. War, at least in modern times, probably directs the attention of scientists to practical technological problems of immediate relevance to the prosecution of war. It seems to have promoted developments in aeronautics, surgery, and atomic energy. The high rate of technological change in warfare contributes to techno 166</page><page sequence="14">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES logical advance. War has hindered science by causing a relative neglect of basic theory and by restrictions on freedom of inquiry and communication, not to mention its destruction of life and disturbance of cultural activity. (4) Contact with other cultures has been a particular stimulus to sociology and anthropology. (5) Individuals who have been in contact with more than one culture but not closely bound to any seem to contribute disproportionately to the process of discovery. This is one explanation for the important role played by Jews in modern science. F. LINGUISTIC Language both reflects men's interpretation of their experience and structures that experience; the two roles are difficult to distinguish. The relationship of language to science is a subject that has received little investigation but promises much. (1) It has already been mentioned that an attitude which regards symbols as having inherent value or meaning is generally unfavorable to science. (2) Languages based on sound units (as are the Indo-European) are probably easier to learn than those based on meaning-units (such as Chinese), where a separate symbol is required for each meaning. Under the latter condition, mastery of the written language may be restricted to members of a scholarly class. (3) Some languages may lend themselves more easily than others to abstract concepts. While the ability to develop such concepts is prerequisite to science, it may also have consequences of a quite different sort. Thus, the ease with which abstract nouns can be formulated from other parts of speech in the German language may have contributed to the grandiose speculative character of German philosophy, and sometimes German science. (4) Language also serves to focus attention on various aspects of expe rience and thus may focus the direction of inquiry. (5) The grammatical structure of language influences the forms in which questions are asked and problems defined. The subject-predicate form of European languages is an outstanding example. (6) Separation of the language of learning (e.g., medieval Latin) from the language of other activity hinders the development of learning. 167</page><page sequence="15">ERWIN W. FELLOWS (7) Concepts of time and space are varyingly expressed, and some of these formulations may lend themselves with differential ease to scientific purposes. (8) Metaphors and analogies have influenced the types of explanations sought and perhaps the kinds of problems investigated. The most important general figures of speech in the history of science are probably the mechanical, organic, anthropomorphic, thermodynamic, and (most recently) electronic. It has been suggested that Americans are inclined to the use of mechanical analogies, Europeans to organic. (9) Any language can probably be modified so that scientific activity can be carried on if other conditions are favorable. Linguistic patterns, Hockett has suggested, are less restrictive for science than for literature, philosophy, and religion. The development of specialized technical vocabularies reflects the development and differentiation of culture rather than causing it. However, languages may differ in the fineness of distinction made possible for given kinds of experience, or at least in the ease with which distinctions of a given degree of fineness can be made. It may be that concepts related to process and change are more easily expressed in agglutinative languages, while atomistic ideas are readily formulated in isolating languages such as English. G. DEMOGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC (1) The relationships between demographic characteristics and science are generally indirect. Low population density, accompanied by a low degree of division of labor, is unfavorable to science, for under such circumstances there is little surplus energy for the support of intellectual activities. The high degree of social interaction which usually accompanies high population density tends to lower the value placed on tradition and to promote innovation and criticism. It increases opportunities for cooperative efforts. The density and distribution of population may be related to personality types and in that manner related to the pursuit of scientific activity. (2) The early development of natural history occurred in regions of unusual geological or biological features. It has been suggested that the fact that a high percentage of American physical and biological scientists come from the West and Midwest may be related to the fact that they 168</page><page sequence="16">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES have more intimate contact with nature than do the more urbanized Easterners. Perhaps the latter are more inclined towards the social sciences. (3) The concept of space as room for expansion, in contrast with space as order, was associated with the age of exploration and discovery; each of these concepts has led to scientific advances (Pledge). Durkheim maintained that our concepts of space and time are derived from the arrangements and rhythms of social ritual. (4) Urbanization made possible the development of libraries and other cultural facilities which aided intellectual advance. H. MISCELLANEOUS CULTURAL (1) The great periods of scientific achievement have generally been times of high achievement in art: Egypt, Greece, the Renaissance. In mid seventeenth-century England, on the other hand, scientific advance was accompanied by a relative decline in the plastic and graphic arts, under Puritan influence. A list of individuals who have been co-achievers in art and science would include Leonardo, Omar Khayyam, Goethe, Albrecht D?rer, Bernard Palissy, Albert Schweitzer. While both art and science seek to create patterns possessing esthetic value, the esthetic appeal of a pattern has sometimes hindered the development of more adequate ones (perhaps most obviously in the history of astronomy). Greek mathematics may have been much influenced by the 'harmonious simplicity' of Greek esthetics. (2) The history of music shows many points of contact with mathematics and the scientific study of sound. It may have contributed to the mathemat ical emphasis of seventeenth century science. (3) Artistic problems and ideas have contributed to scientific discoveries; the experimental methods of artists, craftsmen, and alchemists were borrowed by scientists. (4) At the present time, technology is largely a product of science. For most of the historical record, the relationship is largely reversed: science developed in paths made possible by technological advances which, themselves, were fairly independent of science. Such a basic invention as the steam engine was the work of mechanics and craftsmen, not scientists. The most important invention, in historic times, in terms of influence on 169</page><page sequence="17">ERWIN W. FELLOWS scientific development, is probably the mechanical clock. The change in attitude toward time, expressed in and fostered by the clock, contributed to habits of punctuality and efficiency needed by both the modern economy and modern science. Many scientific instruments were dependent on clockwork mechanisms. Glass also played an important role in the history of instruments. Singer suggested that the revival of learning in modern times might be partly a result of additional years of eyesight made possible by spectacles. Many fundamental instruments were developed largely for craft or industrial purposes and only used later in scientific inquiry. Many early technological achievements were first used as toys or for divination or ceremonial purposes. This was true of the engineering devices of the Greeks, although some of them were also used in war. Greek geometry derived its basic problems from architectural and engineering practice. The invention of printing made the communication of science on a large scale possible. (5) The development of educational institutions not limited to the training of any one class or occupation has been a boon to the development of science. In the United States, it has been found that small, non-Catholic, liberal arts colleges are most productive of scientists. (6) The needs developed in a culture serve to direct scientific inquiry. Early astronomy was promoted by a need for measuring long periods of time in connection with agricultural practices, determining position at sea, or the assumed influence of the stars on human events. Mathematics has been stimulated by a need for record-keeping in a commercial society. Industrial needs have promoted research in energy and materials. Urbanization created problem situations in engineering (water supply, sanitation, transportation), health (hospitals, public health measures), and social relations (welfare agencies), and thus stimulated the develop ment of related bodies of knowledge. Obviously there is a reciprocal relation between need and inquiry: science creates needs as well as satisfying them. An excessive utilitarian emphasis (e.g., Rome) is un favorable to science. Needs function effectively in the advancement of science only when the accumulation of knowledge is sufficient for an adequate response to a need. (7) In general, it appears that periods of scientific achievement in a nation correspond with periods of general cultural achievement and political power. 170</page><page sequence="18">SOCIAL AND CULTURAL INFLUENCES CONCLUSION Since this has been an introductory outline of a field of study which is not itself highly developed, it is difficult to state many general conclusions. Inquiring spirits have undoubtedly existed in every society and all periods of history. Occasionally their efforts have led to logically integrated systems of ideas. Very rarely have such systems of ideas been associated with a cooperative social pattern of empirical investigation. That high degree of development seems to be favored by an atmosphere of freedom, of skepticism of authority, of a humanistic and secular orientation. It may not be closely associated with any particular form of social or economic organization, but is undoubtedly influenced by such organiza tion. Deliberate cultivation of science on the part of dominant groups in a society may result in spectacular advances for a time, but such achieve ments are probably always limited by the social environment. Further study may make it possible to describe relationships between science and its cultural setting in greater detail and with a higher degree of certainty, but it must always be kept in mind that the kind of environ ment which is most appropriate for science at one stage of its development may not be the most appropriate at another. The existence of a leisure class supported by slave labor may have made possible early scientific achievements, but these were definitely limited. Feudal social organization promoted various technological advances which could only be fully utilized by a later capitalist industrial order, which in turn was associated with a marked advance in scientific thought. It may be that we are again at a point in history where new socio-economic forms will be required if scientific advance is to continue. So far as the relationship of particular scientific theories to surrounding cultural conditions is concerned, Phillip Frank's interpretation has at least the merit of plausibility: where alternative general theories are available for the explanation of a set of phenomena, and a decision between them cannot be reached on scientific grounds, a decision is likely to be made in terms of more pervasive cultural values. The cycles of mechanism and vitalism, of atomism and holism, for instance, may be explained on this basis. Modern science is, of course, exerting an increasing influence on social organization, values, and other aspects of human culture. The nature of 171</page><page sequence="19">ERWIN W. FELLOWS that influence is beyond the scope of this paper. It may be suggested, however, that science will achieve full realization only when it becomes diffused as a basic problemsolving attitude among all educated persons, and when, on the other hand, the scientific specialist functions in a context which advances human well-being. 172</page></plain_text>
