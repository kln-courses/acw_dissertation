<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID M. LEVIN* Toward Effective Cetacean Protection Of all the plights modern man has inflicted upon his ecosystem, none is more grievous than his slaughter of the handsome, intelligent, and highly sentient whales. Once abundant in all the seas of the world, many species are now on the verge of extinction. Prior to man's commercial exploitation of these animals, they numbered approximately 4 million. Today, the repro- ducible population of whales numbers only 1.2 million.1 The majestic Blue Whale, largest creature ever to inhabit the earth, once numbered in the hun- dreds of thousands; today as few as 600 survive.2 Man's relationship with the whale (a generic term encompassing whales, dolphins, and porpoises) has not always been one of hunter and hunted. In the first century a.D., Pliny the Elder described how the ancient Greeks developed a cooperative relationship with dolphins. The dolphins would lead the fishermen to schools of fish in return for a share of the catch. It was reported that the friendly dolphins would wait in the area until the following day when they would be rewarded for their efforts with bread dipped in wine.3 As a result of such cooperation, man came to revere the dolphin. In the second century a.D., the Greek poet, Oppian of Cilicia, wrote: The hunting of dolphins is immoral, and that man can no more draw nigh the gods as a welcome sacrificer nor touch their altars with clean hands but pollute those who share the same roof with him who so willfully devises destruction of dolphins. For equally with human slaughter the gods abhor the deathly doom of the monarchs of the deep.4 It has been noted that primitive peoples existing today in coastal areas and along large rivers also live in cooperation with dolphins. These smaller whales have been utilized to herd fish into the fisherman's net and to protect the villagers from piranha fish.5 It is not surprising, therefore, to find that whales play an important role in these primitive cultures. ♦Candidate, LL.M., University of Miami, J.D., Cumberland School of Law, 1979; B.S., Trinity College (Ct.) 1975. 1 Scarf f, The International Management of Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises: An Interdis- ciplinary Assessment (Part I), 6 Ecology L.Q. 323, 330 (1977) [hereinafter cited as Scarff I]. 2 Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Oceans and Atmosphere of the Senate Commerce Comm., 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 320 (1972) [hereinafter cited as 1972 Senate Hearings]. 3Id. at 255. 4Scarff I, supra note 1, at 383. 3 Hearings tsejore me òubcomm. on tishenes and Wildlife Conservation of the House 549</page><page sequence="2">550 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL.

Paintings and woodcarvings from early sea- faring cultures portray sailing ships surrounded by playful and friendly whales. Numerous sea legends tell of how dolphins have saved the lives of drowning people. During the Middle Ages and after, man came to view himself as the center of the universe. Man perceived his position in life from a literal intepretation of the Bible. He was to dominate and control all that was around him. So God created man in his own image . . . and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have domain over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."6 With this "divine guidance" as an impetus, man embarked on an inces- sant course of environmental degradation and exploitation of the marine resources. Never has such degradation and exploitation occurred at a greater or more catastrophic rate than has been witnessed in this century. Since 1930 Finback Whales have diminished from 400,000 to 100,000, a depletion of 75 percent. The Humpback Whale has declined from 100,000 to 2,000; the Gray Whales number, at most, 10,000; the worldwide total of Right and Bowhead Whales is less than 250 each; and the Blue Whales, the largest and perhaps most intelligent animal ever to inhabit the earth, has been decreased by a factor of about 99 percent.7 Captain Jacques Cousteau has estimated from his undersea explorations that ocean life in general has decreased by 40 percent in the last 20 years. He cites that man's pollution of rivers with DDT, mercury, and other chemicals, is causing the oceans to become "the final cesspool of most of man's activities."8 Man's depletion of the marine resources has not been accidental or en- tirely incidental to his terrestrial activities. Man intentionally has sought and slaughtered millions of whales pursuant to commercial greed. The whaling industry and the tuna fishing industry have had the greatest detrimental effect upon whale populations. In spite of the recent decline in international whaling due to the severely depleted population of whales, the Japanese and Russian whaling industries continue to thrive. Together, these two nations account for 80 percent of the captured whales.9 The Japanese hunt whales primarily as a Comm. on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 99 (1971) [hereinafter cited as 1971 House Hearings], 'Genesis 1:27-28 (Revised Standard, 1952). 11972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 320. %Id. at 248. •Christol, Schmidhauser &amp; Totten, The Law and the Whale: Current Developments in the International Whaling Controversy, 8 Case W.

In 1973 Japan's domestic whale meat supplies totaled 123,000 tons. Of this total, 61 ,500 tons were earmarked for general public consump- tion, 15,000 tons for school lunches, and 46,000 tons for canned and pro- cessed products including ham and sausage.10 The Russians, however, hunt whales for their oil. They are particularly interested in the Sperm Whale which produces an oil called "spermaceti." This is an inedible, liquid wax which does not smoke when burned. Although widely used in the nineteenth century as an illuminating fuel, spermaceti is used today mainly as a high quality lubricant in missiles and other sensitive equipment.11 In 1972 the total value of whale products was $100 million.12 Whaling activities have reduced the total world whale population by approximately 46 percent. However, due to the selectivity of the whaling in- dustry, the populations of certain species have exhibited proportionately greater reductions than those of other species. The larger Baleen species, for example, have been particularly hard hit. Some Baleen species in the Ant- arctic have been reduced by as much as 96 percent.13 The modern American tuna fisherman utilizes dolphins to help locate schools of fish in much the same manner as the ancient Greeks did. However, there the similarity ends. Instead of rewarding the dolphins with food and respect, the tuna fisherman frequently kills them. Approximately 80 percent of the worldwide slaughter of dolphins and porpoises is perpe- trated by the United States tuna fleet.14 Between 1959 and 1972 an estimated 5,746,000 dolphins were killed "incidental" to tuna fishing.15 Because of the decline in the profitability of whaling due to the deple- tion of whale populations and the demise of the whaling industry in a number of countries including the United States, one might suspect that commercial whaling will cease before the whales are driven to biological ex- tinction. Recent evidence, however, suggests that the nations currently engaged in whaling will not be content to cease operations when the whales reach commercial extinction. One hypothesis is that it would be more economical for the whaling industry to kill off the world's remaining whales and take a short-term gain rather than to kill a limited number every year over an indefinite period to prolong biological extinction.16 Also, it has been reported that the Japanese whaling industry already is anticipating the day when there will be no more large whales to kill. The Japanese are preparing to substitute porpoises and dolphins for larger "Id. at 164. "Note, Legal Aspects of the International Whaling Controversy: Will Jonah Swallow the Whale? 8 N.Y.U.J.

It is feared that by capturing large quantities of dolphins in nets, these creatures will soon face the same danger of extinction as the larger whales.17 Only within the last 10 years has there been any discernible amount of international concern over the morality of killing whales. In fact, only within the last 10 to 20 years has there been any popular or scientific interest in these creatures at all. Increased public exposure of these animals has fos- tered increased scientific investigation. Some of the preliminary results of such investigations are astounding. Whales exhibit close personal, family and social relationships and structures. Porpoises caught in a net will not leave the side of a mate or in- fant, even if prodded to do so. A school of whales will follow one of their members harpooned by a whaling fleet and thus offer themselves through family fidelity to wholesale massacre.18 Recent studies indicate that whales possess a high degree of in- telligence. The gulf between the mental capacity of man and of these animals may not be as vast as first suspected. Evidence suggests that man may not be the only animal with self-consciousness and the ability to reason and to express creative thoughts.19 Evidence also suggests that man and whales may not be that far apart evolutionally. Both whales and man are warm-blooded, air-breathing mam- mals. Whales possess vestigial hip-bones which are unconnected to the rest of the skeleton. This evidence suggests that the whales' ancestors once in- habited the land, returning to the sea presumably in search of food or pro- tection.20 Man's growing concern about whales may have its roots in a more pro- found level. Man has recently become cognizant of the effects upon nature he has had through his degradation of the environment. Man is learning of his interdependence with natural systems. He is finally coming to the reali- zation that "Whatever the nature of the Creator he surely did not intend that the forms on which he bestowed the gift of life should be exterminated by man."21 Senator Alan Cranston of California has articulated this grow- ing consciousness: The death of a species is profound, for it means nature has lost one of its com- ponents, which played a role in the interrelationship of life on earth. Here the cycle of birth and death ends. Here there is no life, no chance to begin again- simply a void. To cause the extinction of a species, whether by commission or omission, is unqualifiedly evil. The prevention of this extinction, thus, must be a tenet among man's moral responsibilities.22 "Id. at 255. "Id. at 249. "Burr, Toward Legal Rights for Animals, 4 Envtl Aff. 205, 217 (1975).

INTRODUCING THE CETACEANS Dolphins, whales, and porpoises belong to an order of mammals called "Cetácea." As mammals, they characteristically are warm-blooded, suckle their young, and breathe air. Although their ancestors were terrestrial, the Cetaceans have completely adapted both morphologically and physiologi- cally to life in the sea. Their bodies are streamlined to minimize resistance in the water, thus maximizing efficient movement. Cetacean forelimbs have been modified in- to flippers used for stabilization and guidance, while their tail has been modified to form a broad, flat fluke used in locomotion. The musculature for locomotion is so strong that a dolphin can stand with two-thirds of its body length out of the water for seconds at a time and can swim at a velocity of 20 miles per hour almost indefinitely.23 Cetaceans have the capacity to store oxygen in reservoirs within their muscles, and their blood can absorb more oxygen than man's. By slowing their heartbeat and restricting the flow of blood throughout their body (ex- cept to the brain), Cetaceans are able to dive to great depths and for long durations with no side effects. The Sperm Whale, for instance, can reach depths of up to 3,742 feet and remain submerged for more than 75 minutes. The naked human diver rarely dives deeper than 100 feet.24 Other modifications to permit Cetaceans to survive in their aquatic habitat include a thick layer of fat, called "blubber," located under the skin which serves as protection against the cold. In addition, the nostrils have been moved to a position on top of the head to facilitate breathing. The average life-span for Cetaceans is 25 to 35 years. They reach sexual maturity at the age of 8. The female has the capacity to give birth once a year for 14 years. Cetaceans generally give birth to one calf per pregnancy and, generally, do not become pregnant until after the previous calf's lacta- tion period, which lasts about 9 months. The gestation period is about 12 months. Although Cetaceans are sexually active all year round, they generally tend to breed in the spring and summer. Sexual experimentation of all kinds, body-rubbing, mouthing, biting, and flipper-touching has been "1 Cousteau, The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau 14 (1973) [hereinafter cited as Cousteau, Vol. 1). 24Id.

The structure of the teeth and skulls differentiates the living suborders.27 The teeth of the Mysticeti never emerge. They are present only in the gums of the immature. They are instead replaced by so-called baleen plates which are used to strain minute crustaceans, known as krill, from the sea water. Odontoceti, on the other hand, may have a full, and sometimes powerful, set of permanent teeth.28 The following is a list of the two suborders of Cetácea followed by their included families.

Most of the large whales are found in all the major oceans of the world. Each species of whales is divided into two different populations separated by the equatorial zone which the whales do not cross.29 Additionally, all Baleen whale species exhibit a similar distribution based on their depen- dence on krill. Large concentrations of krill occur only in the polar regions. Each summer, Baleen whales migrate to the polar waters to feed and then migrate in the winter to the equatorial regions to breed. Since the seasons are six months out of phase between the Northern and Southern Hemi- spheres, one population of the same species of whales is feeding while the other is mating. The northern and southern populations of the same species never meet.30 Within each hemisphere there exist genetically distinguishable breeding units within a species. These breeding units or "stocks" are poten- tially capable of interbreeding, but do not interbreed because of geographi- cal or behavioral isolation.31 These facts are of great significance when con- sidering the possibility of a depleted species increasing its population size. The total worldwide population may be sufficient to keep the species viable, but the individual populations, geographically isolated, may not be of suffi- cient numbers to reproduce. Whales range in size from the almost dainty Harbor porpoise, approxi- mately five feet long, to the mighty Blue Whale. The Blue Whale is the largest creature ever to inhabit the earth. It is larger than 30 elephants and also larger than the combined size of three of the largest dinosaurs. Its weight of 152 tons is the approximate weight of 2,000 humans. Its heart weighs 1 ,200 pounds, its liver a ton, and its tongue more than one-third ton. For all of its massive bulk, the Blue Whale's throat is so small it cannot swallow anything larger than a sardine.32 The Blue Whale, a Baleen whale, eats only minute krill and phy to plank ton.

XII, NO. 4 Blue Whale will eat approximately two tons of krill per day.33 Whereas man is a visual animal, Cetaceans are acoustic creatures. The Cetacean skull has been modified by evolution to receive a wide variety of waterborne vibrations. The Cetacean hearing range goes up to 150,000 cycles compared to a top limit in man of 12,000 cycles.34 The whales navigate employing a sonarlike process called "echolocation." The whale emits high frequency clicks and whistles, focusing the signals "through a 'lens' of fat in the forehead." By simultaneously analyzing the echoes, a dolphin has been found to have the ability to pinpoint a vitamin capsule dropped into the far end of a sizable pool.35 Scientific data indicate that dolphins have an incredibly refined capability to form sonic images. They can differentiate by "hearing" the composition and texture of objects pre- sented to them. Dr. Kenneth Norris, an eminent Cetacean authority, hypo- thesizes that Cetaceans "can look into each other in eerie ways, inspecting the contours of internal air spaces. Such sensitive sonic readings might even inform one dolphin about another's emotional state."36 Cetaceans are highly gregarious animals; they crave companionship and affection. Unable to live alone, they band together in strictly organized herds. The Baleen whales usually travel in small groups of mixed sexes called "pods"37 whereas the dolphins generally band together in schools of 1,000 or more.38 Delinquency within a social group is punished by ostracism. This is the most severe form of Cetacean punishment and leads to demoralization and death.39 Similar behavior has been witnessed from dolphins kept in captivi- ty. Dr. John Lilly, a prominent cetologist, has observed that the bond be- tween his researchers and the dolphins in many instances had become so strong that when researchers were reassigned, or when it became evident to the dolphins that, no matter how hard they tried, they were not going to be able to establish real communication, the dolphins first exhibited behavior indicating frustration, and then, they died. "In fact, they literally commit- ted suicide."40 Most Cetaceans are playful creatures and their playful activities con- tinue through adulthood. Adult Sperm Whales regularly jump clear of the water (breaching) and fall back on their sides or bellies with a reverberating crash. They also engage in a fascinating activity called "lob-tailing" by positioning themselves vertically with their heads down and their tails out of the water. Swinging from side to side, they crack their flukes against the "Scarf f I, supra note 1, at 339. "Cousteau, Vol. 1, supra note 23, at 54. "National Geographic, April 1979, at 515. "Id.

They are very attentive to their calves and keep them from straying. The mother will pre- vent the young from approaching new objects and protect them from in- jury. Most whalers report that a female will stay with a wounded calf until it has died. Using this knowledge, whalers will frequently wound a calf only slightly, facilitating the kill of the female which comes to tend it.43 Whales, in general, are very protective of members of their herd. Sperm Whales have been seen to circle around a wounded calf with their heads facing the center and their powerful flukes slapping the water to chase off a pod of Killer Whales.44 Cetaceans usually remain in close proximity to an injured group member, often attempting to guide or push it from danger. Whalers report that protective Cetaceans have tried to bite through a harpoon line, attempted to get between the whaler and the injured animal, and even have overturned whaling boats.45 In ascertaining the relative intelligence of man to other animals, it must be cautioned that most human definitions of "intelligence" are extremely anthropomorphic. To avoid this critical problem, scientists have examined structural similarities between man and other mammals of the cerebral cor- tex of the brain. It is within the cerebral cortex that those functions of the brain associated with so-called intelligence are controlled. The cerebral cortex functions on at least three levels: (1) it records changes in the external and internal environments; (2) it evaluates the en- vironment on the basis of needs and experience; and (3) it initiates motor ac- tivity to adjust the internal and external environments. The cerebral cortex is also most likely responsible for thinking, memory, and language.46 Generally, a high degree of convolution of the cerebral cortex connotes a high degree of cerebral functions since this increases the surface area of the cortex. Man's brain is the most highly convoluted of all land mammals. The cerebral cortex of all Cetaceans, however, is more highly convoluted than man's. Additionally, the number of neurons, or nerve cells, in the Cetacean cerebral cortex is greater than the 14 billion neurons in the human cerebral cortex.47 4 ' Coffe y , supra note 27, at 21. 421972 Hearings, supra note 26, at 254.

XII, NO. 4 When comparing the relative degree of Cetacean intelligence to that of man, it must be remembered that Cetaceans and humans live in totally dif- ferent environments. If, however, cortically mediated behavior is an ade- quate index of intelligence, the similarity between the human cortex and the Cetacean cortex clearly indicates the likelihood of high Cetacean intelli- gence. If the ability to communicate is used as the index of intelligence, Ceta- ceans also satisfy that criterion. They are capable of complex intra- and inter-species communication. It is thought that this ability to communicate may allow for the transmission of information necessary for survival to successive generations.48 The United States Navy has been experimenting with and training Cetaceans for nearly two decades. They have been trained to recover objects lost at sea and to serve as messengers between surface vessels and undersea installations.49 Morgan, a 1,200 pound Killer Whale, for example, has been trained to recover dummy torpedoes.50 Experiments are being conducted to train dolphins to act as underwater "watch dogs."51 Many of the Navy's uses of Cetaceans are shrouded in secrecy, and although the military emphatically denies that it ever has or ever will employ Cetaceans as offensive weapons, reports abound to the contrary. It has been reported that dolphins have been trained to carry "limpet bombs" and to attach them to the hulls of enemy ships. It has been claimed that dolphins have placed chemical "bugs" in enemy harbors to establish types of fuel be- ing used in enemy ships. Dolphins, were, in fact, sent to Vietnam and are said to have been used to protect the sea surrounding allied habors and ships from attack by enemy frogmen.52 II. COMMERCIAL EXPLOITATION OF CETACEANS Commercial whaling can be traced to the Basques, who, in the eleventh or twelfth century, first hunted Right Whales for their meat in the Bay of Biscay. This species is so named because it was the "right" whale to kill; it was a slow swimmer, swam close to shore, and floated when killed. The saga of the Basque whaling industry set a pattern of short-sighted exploita- tion which has been followed through the years and, regrettably, continues today. By the thirteenth century, in spite of primitive whaling technology, the Basques had depleted their local stocks. Improved technology enabled the Basques to venture farther from shore and hunt new stocks of Right Whales in the fifteenth century. During this period the Basques began to hunt the whales for oil as well as for meat. 4lScarff I, supra note 1, at 338. 49Id. at 377.

By the seventeenth century, other nations, adopting the Basque tech- nology, instituted whaling industries. As a consequence, Right Whales soon became extremely scarce in the North Atlantic. Holland began hunting the newly discovered stocks of Bowhead Whales off Greenland. With the rev- enues derived from this stock, abundant in the Arctic, whaling of the com- mercially extinct Right Whales could be continued. Moving farther west in search of undepleted stocks, a small whaling in- dustry became established in New England during the seventeenth century. The American whaling industry reached its peak in 1846 when it employed 70,000 people and there were 729 whaling ships sailing under the American flag. American whalers circumnavigated the globe seeking new stocks of whales. Although the hostilities of the Civil War destroyed most of the whaling fleet, the eastern industry's collapse was less a consequence of the war than of the depleted condition of local whale stocks. Additionally, the discovery of petroleum in 1859 and the development of the electric light in 1879 drastically reduced the demand for sperm oil, the mainstay of the American industry. A second American whaling industry developed on the West Coast dur- ing the middle of the nineteenth century. There, whalers hunted stocks of the Bowheads to the north and the California Gray to the south. The largest breeding ground of the California Gray was discovered in Baja California in 1851. By 1890, less than forty years later, the California Gray was be- lieved to be hunted to extinction and the southern West Coast whaling in- dustry folded.53 In 1870 the international whaling industry was revived by the develop- ment of the "shell harpoon," a harpoon fired from a gun. Previously whales were killed by using hand-thrown shafts. This new improvement enabled killing from a distance, thus increasing the number caught due to its range and safety. Whalers were now able to kill the strong and swift Fin Whales.54 By the end of the nineteenth century the Gray, Right, Bowhead, and Northern Humpback Whales had been driven to the edge of extinction, and the international whaling industry was on the verge of collapse. A succession of technological advancements saved international whal- ing and fostered its swift recovery.

XII, NO. 4 casses could be hauled directly on board,36 spurred a period of intensive whaling. By the beginning of the twentieth century the depletion of stocks in the Northern Hemisphere forced whalers to travel farther and farther south un- til it was necessary to enter the inhospitable Antarctic seas. In 1911, 8,500 Humpbacks were killed in the Antarctic. By 1922 the Humpbacks had be- come so scarce that only nine were killed that year.57 Although whaling was curtailed due to the hostilities of World War I, depletion of supplies of petroleum spurred a rapid recovery of the industry following the war. Whale oil production increased tenfold between 1920 and 193L58 Whaling activities were curtailed again during World War II. Since World War II the overcapitalized whaling industry has never achieved fi- nancial stability. Today, helicopters and sonar-equipped ships are employed in the search for whales. These have become increasingly necessary due to the worldwide depletion of whales. No unexplored whaling territory exists, and only the heavily exploited Antarctic and North Pacific Oceans contain com- mercially viable stocks of whales. Only Fin, Sei, Bryde's, Minke, and Sperm Whales are currently being hunted commercially.39 One would logically expect that as whales become increasingly scarce, a point would be reached where it would no longer be economical to continue the hunt for whales. In economic parlance, "the marginal cost of catching whales increases in inverse proportion to the stock size."60 As whales become scarce, however, the value of their products, particularly sperma- ceti, increases greatly. Operators in an overcapitalized industry, such as whaling, will seek every opportunity to increase their revenues. As a consequence, the whaling industry is far from dead. Instead, new technology is developed to cope with problems of an ever-decreasing supply of whales. The Norwegians have revolutionized the industry by the development of a combination catcher-factory ship, a vessel which is faster, cheaper to operate, and has a longer range than the traditional factory ships.61 Far from being dead, the international whaling industry has flourished in recent years. The decade from 1960 to 1970 was the most productive in whaling history. The 1960s were two to three times as destructive of whale populations as any preceding decade.62 "Note, supra note 54, at 100. 57Scarff I, supra note 1, at 347. "Id.

Russia and Japan are experimenting with ships that can be utilized for both whaling and sealing operations. Profits from the seals would be used to sub- sidize Antarctic whaling.63 As the availability of larger whales continues to decline, it is inevitable that the international whaling community will look to the smaller Cetaceans as a source of revenue. All of the products heretofore derived from the larger whales may be derived from the smaller Cetaceans. The oil from small Cetaceans is similar to sperm oil and may be similarly used as a lubricant.64 Since antiquity the Japanese have eaten porpoise. Villagers captured porpoise schools that wandered along their shores.65 There are indications that Japan is currently building ships to harvest porpoises in waters beyond her own seas and em- ploying guns that fire clusters of small harpoons into herds of porpoises riding the bow wake.66 The Japanese also presently are killing an estimated 20,000 Dall's Porpoises a year from a population estimated at 30,000 to 50,000. These porpoises are killed incidentally to the Japanese North Pacific gill net salmon fishery.67 The Norwegians have operated a widespread direct fishery on small Cetaceans in the North Atlantic and Black Sea for several decades. The Norwegians are currently hunting the Northern Bottlenose Whale, Killer Whale, Long-Finned Pilot Whale, and Minke Whale, in addition to an an- nual take of over 100,000 Common Dolphins, Harbor Porpoises, and Bottlenose Dolphins.68 Today the American whaling industry is nonexistent. The American tuna fishing industry, however, is the largest in the world and has a sizable impact on the nation's economy. The tuna fleet directly employs 6,800 peo- ple and indirectly employs shipbuilders, gear and other suppliers, long- shoremen and warehousemen, totaling approximately 21,000 persons. Tuna canneries employ another 10,000 people69 who, in 1975, produced 1.5 billion cans of tuna valued at $820 million.70 The American public con- sumes 3.1 pounds of tuna per capita each year.71 It is important to digest these facts for, although tuna is neither a marine mammal nor a Cetacean, the American tuna fishing industry has a "id.

XII, NO. 4 tremendously adverse effect upon the survival of small Cetaceans, notably dolphins. American fishermen have been fishing for tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean off the coast of Central America and Mexico since the 1930s. From 1930 to 1957 the principal method of fishing for tuna was * 'bait-fishing." Live bait was kept aboard the tuna boats. When a school of tuna was located, bait was thrown overboard to keep the tuna close to the boat. Fishing was conducted using poles with long lines to which artificial lures were attached.72 A few fishermen employed cotton nets to catch tuna. But these nets were extremely heavy, the cotton fiber was too weak and tore frequently, and the cotton rotted too fast to be economically feasible.73 The 1950s brought economic crisis to the American tuna fleet. Low priced Japanese-caught tuna was competing with American-caught tuna at the marketplace. The 1950s also brought the introduction of nets made from synthetic fibers. These nets were lighter and stronger than cotton and would not rot in warm water. The first American tuna boat converted to the nylon net in 1957, and the conversion of nearly the entire fleet was accom- plished by 196 1.74 The net-equipped tuna fishermen began to take advantage of a relation- ship they had known to exist for some time. For some inexplicable reason schools of Yellowfin tuna swim beneath and behind schools of certain spe- cies of dolphin. Scientists have speculated that this relationship might be based on the prowess of the dolphins in finding food for the tuna. Others have postulated that the tuna associate with the dolphins for protection against predators. The most plausible explanation is that the dolphins, who swim close to the surface, provide "a visual stimulus for spatial orientation in the optical void of the pelagic environment."75 This hypothesis is strengthened by observations of schools of tuna faithfully gathered beneath a floating log, a patch of seaweed, or dead whales. When a school of porpoises is spotted, the tuna boat deploys high-pow- ered speedboats to consolidate the school and slow it down. This corralling procedure may be very difficult because the porpoise school may consist of several thousand porpoises. The tuna-porpoise bond is so tight that should a small piece of the school of porpoises break away, the entire school of tuna may follow. Upon consolidation of the school, the tuna boat makes a broad circle around the school creating a deep wake. The porpoises detect the wakes with their sonar and will not pass through them. When wind and sea conditions are right, the large net is cast into the sea. The ship continues circling until the circle of the net is complete. Once the net circle is com- plete, the bottom of the net is pursed, thus closing the trap.

Spotters, who seem to be very contact oriented, appear to reassure each other in stressful conditions by maintaining direct physical contact with other members of the same species. Spotters generally will raft close together in the center of the net. "Rafting" describes a behavior wherein the dolphins remain in a stationary vertical position with their heads out of the water.77 Spinners, on the other hand, have a greater spatial requirement; they seem to avoid a great degree of close contact with other porpoise in the 16 1977 House Hearings, supra note 14, at 50. 11 1975 House Hearings, supra note 71, at 65.</page><page sequence="16">564 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL. XII, NO. 4 net.7* Spinners spend more of their time on the fringes of the net away from the group of Spotters. They are seldom observed to stop moving around the net. Spinners exhibit a great tendency to suddenly rush the net and entangle themselves. Neonates of both species become disoriented when encircled. Because of their youth, neonates are delicate and lack the physical endurance of older porpoises. Even when slightly entangled in the net, they die quickly. They may die primarily of shock or exhaustion, or both.79 Because Cetaceans are air breathers, they must be able to surface periodically to breathe. Difficulties arise when frightened dolphins dive below the surface seeking escape only to get a snout or flipper caught in the net. Once caught in the net, if unable to free itself, the dolphin will drown. If there is a strong current, the net may roll up and trap porpoises in its fold. Frequently, the circling fish within the net will cause a vortex that will result in a net roll-up. The tuna fishermen quickly realized that a net full of tuna and porpoise posed problems which hindered the efficiency of their operation. A net laden with tuna and porpoise was too heavy to be hauled on board ship. Secondly, it was too time-consuming for the tunamen to hand separate their tuna catch from the dead porpoises which were commercially worthless to them. Thirdly, the depletion of porpoise stocks was making it increasingly difficult to locate schools of Yellowfin tuna. It became necessary to develop a procedure so that live porpoises could be taken out of the net as easily as possible without risking the loss of tuna. A procedure called "backdown" was developed. After the net had been set, the tunamen would haul in about three- quarters of the net. The ship's captain would wait until the porpoises were at the surface near the far side of the net circle while the tuna remained close to the ship. When the fish and porpoises were so situated, he would run the engines in full reverse.80 This action would drag the net into an elongated shape causing the corkline at the far end of the net to sink several feet. The effect was to pull the net from under the rafting porpoises.81 A man in the crow's nest would direct the operation. If the fish found the opening or headed toward the porpoises, he would immediately run the ship's engines forward, causing the sunken corkline to bob to the surface. In practice, the backdown procedure was not fool-proof. One of the problems with this procedure was that it was a passive opertion as far as the porpoises were concerned; the net was pulled from under them, they did not swim out. Frequently, the porpoises acted in a counter-productive manner. As indicated earlier, dolphins exhibit a very strong social cohesiveness. "/&lt;/. at 66. 79 1977 House Hearings, supra note 14, at 66.

"tommem, supra noie oy, ai c*o.</page><page sequence="17">TOWARDS EFFECTIVE CETACEAN PROTECTION 565 Often, released individuals or members of the school will swim back into the net and rejoin the main body of the school." Once the porpoises get over the corkline, they are usually in a state of shock or confusion and fre- quently fall victim to awaiting sharks.83 Dragging the net makes its configuration more susceptible to wind, currents, and gear malfunctions, all of which will cause the net to collapse resulting in the entanglement of the porpoises and their death. Similarly, backdown is less efficient when the catch of tuna and porpoises is very large (over 100 tons of fish and 1,000 porpoises). Such sets also spell death for the porpoise.84 A problem-free backdown may still result in a significant number of porpoise deaths. As the net is being pulled, the porpoises frequently will snag a snout or fin in the mesh of the net and drown. The crowding of the porpoises into the narrow backdown channel has severe consequences. Under crowded conditions porpoises establish a hierarchal order of domi- nance and this dominance is achieved through aggressive behavior. The ag- gression increases in intensity as the net volume decreases. Dolphins may suffer severe lacerations and frequently death as a result of this aggressive behavior.83 Researchers have discovered that a porpoise in captivity will sink to the bottom of the pool when frustrated by his training. The porpoise will either turn his belly up or remain suspended in a vertical position. A porpoise in the wild exhibits the same behavior in a purse seine net.86 A porpoise in the training tank will end that behavior to return to the surface to breathe. A porpoise in a net who initiates this so-called sleeping behavior, however, will either not be seen by the crewman in the crow's nest or be assumed dead. As a result, as backdown continues, it will become entangled and drown. As a consequence of the complications described above, even with the employment of the backdown procedure, an average of 400,000 porpoises were killed each year between 1964 and 1972.87 This estimate, however, probably does not reflect accurately the mortality inflicted upon the dol- phins. It became the practice to station tunamen in skiffs in the backdown area. These tunamen were to assist the porpoises in clearing the net during backdown. To rapidly clear the porpoises out of the net, these tunamen em- ployed metal gaffs, barbed iron hooks. Thousands of porpoises were gaffed during backdown. Research has indicated that gaffing of porpoises in this manner can result in debilitating secondary skin infections, abscess forma- tions, or, if the wound penetrates the pleural or peritoneal cavities, death. %21972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 406.

XII, NO. 4 Secondary lung infections from the aspiration of contaminated water in the backdown area produced bronchitis and pneumonia which often resulted in death." In 1971 a tuna fisherman named Harold Medina developed a net modi- fication which had the potential effect of significantly reducing porpoise mortality during backdown. He replaced a large section of the net in the backdown area with smaller than usual mesh netting; 2 inch mesh instead of AVa inch mesh. The smaller mesh reduces the possibility of a porpoise hook- ing a fin or snout and becoming entangled.89 This single modification, call- ed the "Medina Panel," has reduced mortality by an estimated 50 to 75 percent.90 III. EFFORTS TO CONSERVE CETACEANS In the early part of the twentieth century concern over the severely depleted stocks of whales prompted both conservationists and whalers to urge some form of international regulation of whaling. In response to these pressures, the League of Nations in 1927 suggested that an international conference be convened to consider whale conservation. Such a recommendation, however, was opposed by several nations. Japan, one nation in opposition, urged that the problem of whale conservation be handled through bilateral or multilateral agreements among concerned nations. The League of Na- tions failed to pursue this matter, concluding in 1929 that "if hunting becomes unprofitable, it will stop by itself, long before the whales are exter- minated."91 As competition grew fierce for the dwindling stocks of whales, interest- ed whaling nations agreed to convene in 1937 to discuss whale conservation. The results of that conference were agreements that produced a whaling sea- son, prescription of minimum lengths for certain species, provision for gov- ernment inspectors aboard factory ships, and the closing of certain areas of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans to whaling for identified species.92 Following World War II, which saw a suspension of whaling activities, interested nations met again and agreed upon "The 1944 Protocol." This agreement established a maximum allowable total catch for the Antarctic region. The total catch for one season was set at 16,000 blue whale units (b.w.u.). The blue whale unit was equated with two Fin Whales, two and one-half Humpback Whales, and six Sei Whales.93 Intensive whaling resumed after World War II. Concern over excessive kills prompted the United States to call a conference of whaling nations in "1975 House Hearings, supra note 71, at 67. "1972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 402.

The result of that conference was the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.94 The Convention was ratified by all of the ma- jor pelagic whaling nations (Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Denmark, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, South Africa, U.S.S.R., United Kingdom, and the United States) and established the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The 1946 Convention is the embodiment of today's international law of whaling. Current members of the IWC include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, South Africa, U.S.S.R., United Kingdom, and the United States.95 Article V, paragraph 1, of the Convention enumerates the regulatory authority of the IWC to include determination of: (a) protected and unpro- tected species; (b) open and closed seasons; (c) open and closed waters, in- cluding the designation of sanctuary areas; (d) the size limits for each species; (e) time, methods, and intensity of whaling (including the max- imum catch of whales to be taken in any one season); (f) types and specifica- tions of gear and apparatus and appliances which may be used; (g) methods of measurement; and (h) catch returns and other statistical records.96 The IWC established the Scientific Committee whose function was to review catch statistics and research data to make recommendations to the IWC concerning the rates of stock depletion, proposed quotas, and research needs. From this information the IWC enacts the schedule which regulates the whaling season and allowable catches.97 Article V of the Convention further provides that whereas the schedule may be modified only by a three-fourths vote of the IWC, any member na- tion was entitled to object to a modification. Having made an objection within 90 days of the vote, the modification would not be binding on the ob- jecting nation.9' Furthermore, a member can withdraw completely from the Convention by giving six-month notice.99 In 1949 the IWC agreed to its first species quota of 1,250 Humpbacks per year in the Antarctic and agreed to set an Antarctic Baleen whale quota of 16,000 b.w.u. During the first season under this quota, the whaling na- tions exceeded their limit by almost 170 percent. The same quota was in ef- fect for the 1950-51 and 1951-52 seasons, but the quota was again exceeded by 380 and 295 Humpback whales, respectively.100 In 1954 the IWC boldly attempted one of its first conservation initia- tives by banning the hunting of Blue Whales in the North Pacific.

XII, NO. 4 rassed by formal objections to such a move by Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United States, the IWC subsequently did not attempt to pass measures unless it first had the consent of key nations.101 In 1956 evidence of worldwide stock depletion was so overwhelming that the IWC voted to reduce the annual quota to 14,500 b.w.u. In 1958 when it was decided to continue this quota, the representative from the Netherlands formally objected. The result was an increase of the quota to 15,000 b.w.u., even though there was convincing evidence that the 14,500 quota was far too high.102 In light of the inability of the IWC to reduce quotas, even when the evidence clearly mandated such a move, conservation-oriented nations passed an agreement in 1960 wherein the IWC would appoint a committee of three experts in population biology who were not connected with whaling nations and who would make recommendations to the IWC. The major whaling nations agreed that they would abide by the committee's (known as the "Committee of Three") recommendations by 1964. The final report of the Committee of Three issued in 1963 recommend- ed a total ban on the hunting of Blue and Humpback Whales, a quota not to exceed 7,000 Antarctic Fin Whales, and the replacement of the blue whale unit by a quota set for each species. The IWC rejected these recommenda- tions, retained the blue whale unit, and set an Antarctic quota of 10,000 b.w.u.103 The Antarctic stocks were so severely depleted by 1964 that the Scien- tific Committee recommended an Antarctic quota of 4,000 Fin Whales and a total Antarctic quota of 3,000 b.w.u. The whaling nations abandoned their former pledge to the Committee of Three and refused to accept the Scientific Committee's recommendations. They agreed to an Antarctic quota of 8,000 b.w.u.104 Only when it appeared that the Blue Whale was on the verge of biologi- cal extinction in 1971 did the IWC agree to abolish the blue whale unit and set quotas by species.105 In 1972 the United Nations convened the Conference on the Environ- ment. The assembled nations voted unanimously (with the whaling nations abstaining) to adopt a resolution calling upon the IWC to effect a 10-year moratorium on commercial whaling. Not surprisingly, when the United States made a motion to the IWC for a 10-year moratorium on commercial whaling, the measure was defeated by a vote of 6-4 with four abstentions. 106 In 1973 when the issue of a moratorium was again raised, representa- tives from Japan and Russia threatened that unless consideration of a mora- iOlId. at 361. i02Id. i03Id. at 364. l04Id. i0SId. at 367. l06Id. at 368.</page><page sequence="21">TOWARDS EFFECTIVE CETACEAN PROTECTION 569 torium or significant quota reductions ceased, they would withdraw from the IWC. When the IWC did agree that year to retain the quota for Minke Whales set the previous year, to divide the Southern Hemisphere Sperm Whale quota into regional quotas, and to phase out Antarctic Fin whaling by 1976, both Japan and the Soviet Union formally objected.107 In 1976 the IWC accepted the Scientific Committee's quota recommen- dations in their entirety. Fin Whales received complete protection in the Antarctic, the quota for Southern Hemisphere Sperm Whales was reduced from 10,740 to 4,791 and divided into nine regional quotas, and for the first time quotas were established for Minke Whales in the North Pacific and for Sei and Sperm Whales in the North Atlantic. Thus, no stock of whales re- mained without its own quota.10' In recognition of the imminent need to provide some manner of protec- tion for the many species of the world's animals on the verge of extinction, the United States Congress passed the Endangered Species Act of 1973. 109 This bill was seen as a "last ditch effort" to prevent the total disappearance of endangered species. It authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to develop a list of species or subspecies of animals that are threatened with worldwide extinction. The Secretary is to include on the list both endangered species, i.e., species which are in danger of extinction, and threatened species, i.e., species which are likely to become endangered species within the foreseeable future. The Secretary of the Interior is to base his determination on any of the following factors: l.the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; 2. overutilization for commercial, sporting, scientific, or educational purposes, 3. disease or prédation; 4. the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or 5. other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.110 Once the Secretary has compiled the list, published it in the Federal Register, and exhausted the proscribed hearing process, the Act makes it unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to: a. import any such species into, or export any such species from the United States; b. take any such species within the United States or the territorial sea of the United States; c. take any such species upon the high seas; d. possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship, by any means whatsoever, any species taken in violation of subparagraphs (b) and (c); e. deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce, by any means whatsoever and in the course of commercial activity, any such species; 107&lt;/.

These practices are employed not only for sustenance, but also as a means of preserving social unity. Provided that their action is for the "purpose of consumption or use in a native com- munity or for creation and sale of native articles of handicrafts and clothing,"114 Alaskan native Indians will be exempted from the provisions of section 1538. This exemption may be revoked, however, upon a showing that such taking materially and negatively affects the threatened or en- dangered species.113 By 1978 the Secretary of the Interior had listed the following species of whales as endangered species: Blue Whale; Bowhead Whale; Finback Whale; Gray Whale; Humpback Whale; Right Whale (all species); Sei Whale; and Sperm Whale.116 This listing has had the effect of drying up a major Japanese market for whale products and has placed the United States in a strong position to advocate international conservation of the whale. It also places, however, a greater pressure for survival on those species of large Cetaceans not protected and upon all smaller Cetaceans. A valuable conservation tool which has yet to be employed to protect Cetaceans is the so-called Pelly Amendment117 to the Fisherman's Pro- tective Act of 1967. 11S This amendment was drafted to bolster conservation efforts aimed at protecting the Atlantic Salmon. In essence, the Pelly Amendment authorizes the president of the United States to prohibit the importation of fishery products from nations which conduct fishing opera- tions "in a manner that diminishes the effectiveness of international fishery conservation programs upon certification by the Secretary of Com- merce."119 The amendment further provides that should the president fail to prohibit such imports, he must inform Congress of his reasons for failing to so act.120 lllId. at § 1538 (1976). li2id. at 8 1532H4Ì Í1976Í. uiId. at§ 1540(1976). n4[1973] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Ad.

It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that "international fishery conservation programs" would necessarily include programs to con- serve Cetaceans. To date the boldest step that the American government has taken to protect Cetaceans is its enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972. m Briefly stated, this Act mandates a moratorium on the harassment, hunting, capture, and killing of all marine mammals. The Act specifies cer- tain exceptions to this moratorium. The Secretary of Commerce is autho- rized to issue permits allowing the importation or taking of marine mam- mals under prescribed conditions. Permits may be issued for the purposes of scientific research, for public display, and for taking marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations.123 Additionally, Alaskan In- dians have been exempted from the Act's provisions if their taking is for subsistence purposes or is done for the purpose of creating and selling authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing.124 The Act applies to any person or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and its scope includes persons or vessels on the high seas or on land and water within the jurisdiction of the United States.125 Civil penalties of up to $10,000 and criminal fines of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to one year have been provided for by the Act,126 in addition to a provision which authorizes the seizure of a vessel employed in contravention of the Act.127 A three-member commission, the Marine Mammal Commission, is established by the Act. The Commission's function is to review existing information on the stocks of marine mammals and to recommend to the Secretary of Commerce (in the case of Cetaceans) appropriate actions in connection with the protection and management of those animals.128 Specifically, the members of this Commission review "the best scientific evidence available" to determine the number of Cetácea that may be taken incidental to commercial fishing operations. In drafting the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), Congress determined that since "man's thumb is already on the balance of nature,"129 it would be in the best interests of the animals for man to man- age their populations.

In an effort to prevent marine mammals from becoming threatened or endangered species, the MMPA bestows upon the Secretary the power to designate as "depleted species or stocks" those species or stocks which the Marine Mammal Commission has determined have declined substantially in number so that the species (1) is in trouble of becoming a threatened or en- dangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 or (2) has fallen below the optimum carrying capacity for the species or stock within its envi- ronment.134 After that determination is made, the taking of depleted species or stocks is absolutely prohibited,135 and no permits may be issued regard- ing a depleted species or stock.136 The Marine Mammal Protection Act granted commercial fishing operations, or more precisely, purse seine tuna fishermen who set their nets on small Cetaceans, a two-year exemption from the provisions of the Act. 137 The purpose of this exemption was to allow the tunamen sufficient time for the development of new techniques and equipment to reduce the number of Cetaceans incidentally taken. The expressed immediate goal to be achieved by the MMPA was that "the incidental kill or incidental serious injury of marine mammals permitted in the course of commercial fishing operations be reduced to insignificant levels approaching a zero mortality and serious injury rate."131 During the two-year exemption period, the tuna fishermen exhibited an approximate 60 percent reduction in the mortality of Cetaceans as com- pared with pre-MMPA average yearly mortality.139 Nevertheless, the mor- olo U.S.C. §1361(2)(1976). 131 Id. l32Id. at § 1361(6) (1976). m/¿ at § 1362(9) (1976). xuId. at § 1362(1) (1976). ■"/&lt;/. at § 1372 (1976).

It was decided, therefore, that the tuna fishermen would be allowed to continue taking Cetaceans through the issuance of permits. Fishermen holding certificates of inclusion issued by the Secretary of Commerce through the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) were permitted to take an unlimited number of porpoise under these permits.141 Various environmental protection organizations challenged the authority of the NMFS to issue permits under these circumstances. The cases were consolidated in the federal district court in Washington, D.C. In Committee for Humane Legislation v. Richardson142 the district court entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs. It held under the MMPA that before issuing permits the NMFS must determine that the effect of any pro- posed taking will not be to the disadvantage of the animals. In addition, the permit must specify the number and specific species of animal which may be taken and the permit applicant must demonstrate to the NMFS that the tak- ing will be compatible with the purposes of the Act. The court invalidated the regulations, permits, and certificates of inclusion which authorized the incidental taking of marine mammals. It also prohibited issuance of any of these permits until the NMFS complied with the Marine Mammal Protec- tion Act.143 The district court's decision invalidating the permits issued by the NMFS and ordering compliance with the MMPA was affirmed on ap- peal.144 Fearing that the immediate impact of its decision would be disas- trous to the commercial fishermen currently operating under a general per- mit, the court of appeals decided to continue the stay of the district court order until January 1, 1977. 145 During the interim the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra- tion (NOAA), an agency of the NMFS, had promulgated regulations to cor- rect the problems indicated by the district court and court of appeals. Spe- cifically, these regulations (1) listed the estimated existing levels of species and population stocks of the marine mammals involved in purse seining for Yellowfin tuna; (2) refined the definition of "optimum sustainable popula- tion"; (3) specified new procedures for permit application including the criteria which will be employed to determine whether a permit request will be accepted; and (4) specified the technology and techniques which must be l40Id. 14lComm. for Humane Legislation v.

For the years 1978, 1979, and 1980, the regulations require a total porpoise mortality rate of 51,945; 41,610; and 31,150, respectively.147 The regulations define "optimum sus- tainable population" as: [a] population size which falls within a range from tht [sic] population levtl [sic] of a given species or stock which is the largest supportable within the ecosystem to the population level that results in maximum net productivity. Maximum net productivity is the greatest net annual increment in population numbers or biomass resulting from additions tõ the population due to reproduction and growth less losses due to natural mortality.141 The regulations specify that two tests be used to assess whether a species or stock is depleted for purposes of the Act. An indication by either test that the species or stock is depleted is sufficient for a determination of deple- tion.149 The first test is a comparison of the estimate of the percentage of the stock's or species' initial unexploited population with the mid-point of the range of the lower bound of the optimum sustainable population. The best evidence to date suggests that this range of the lower bound of the optimum sustainable population (OSP) is 50 to 70 percent of the initial stock size. Should the estimate of the percentage of the stock's or species' initial unex- ploited population be less than the midpoint (60 percent), the stock or species will be deemed depleted. The second test states that a species or stock is depleted if the prob- ability of the stock's or species' initial population exceeding the 50 to 70 percent range of the initial population is less than 50 percent.150 In other words, a stock or species is depleted if there is a 50 percent or higher prob- ability that the estimate of the stock's or species' present population size is below 50 to 70 percent of its initial population size. Applying these tests the Eastern Spinner Dolphin was depleted under the first test, but not under the second one. Nevertheless, because only one test must be satisfied for a depletion determination, the Eastern Spinner Dolphin was declared a depleted species.151 To ascertain the effectiveness of these regulations, to insure their com- pliance, and to gather useful biological data, observers must be used on board tuna boats. While recognizing the importance of such observers, the regulations do not require the use of observers. Instead, the regulations 14*42 Fed.

All certificate holders are required to maintain logs of incidental takings of marine mammals. All deaths and injuries to marine mammals occurring in the course of commercial fishing operations under a General Permit must be reported in writing to the re- gional director within five days of the occurrence. If the vessel returns to port later than five days after such an occurrence, the report shall be made within 48 hours of the vessel's arrival.154 The report must include the loca- tion, time, and date of the death or injury; the identity and number of marine mammals killed or injured; and a description of the circumstances which led to and caused the death or injury.155 These reports are the only means that the NMFS has of recording how many marine mammals are be- ing killed and how many mammals may still be killed in light of the yearly quota. The regulations provide that only pure schools of Spotted Dolphin (Stenella attenuata) offshore stock, Striped Dolphin (Stenella coeruleo- alba), and Common Dolphin (Dephinus delphis) may be encircled. The regulations declare the Spotted Dolphin (Stenella attenuata), coastal stock, the Costa Rican Spinner, and the Eastern Spinner Dolphin (Stenella longirostris) depleted stocks or species. As such, neither pure schools of these mammals nor mixed schools of these and other mammals may be en- circled.156 Despite this prohibition on encircling depleted stocks or species, the regulations allow an exception. If an encirclement begins and the pro- hibited stocks or species are not reasonably observable at the start of the set, no violation will issue even though individuals of that prohibited stock or species are subsequently taken.157 ii2Id. at 64,550. lSiId. at 64,552. l54Id. at 64,553. i55Id. at 64,554. 1 "Id. l"Id. at 64,555.</page><page sequence="28">576 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL.

"15ê The regulations require that the nets of all vessels operating pursuant to a General Permit be equipped with a Porpoise Safety Panel (a Medina Panel) in the backdown area. This panel should be constructed of mesh not to exceed 1 Va inch rather than the standard mesh size of 4V4 inch.159 Three classes of vessels are distinguished by the regulations. Class I vessels are those vessels having a carrying capacity of 400 short tons or less; Class II vessels have a carrying capacity of 400 short tons or greater and were built before 1961; and Class III vessels have a carrying capacity of 400 short tons or more and were built after 196 1.160 The regulations require only Class III vessels to install a triangular- shaped porpoise apron in their net at the backdown area.161 This apron is a recent development which facilitates the passive removal of porpoise during backdown. The apron acts like a ramp "flushing" the porpoise out of the net and reduces the necessity for hand rescue.162 This apron also reduces the number of porpoises lost due to "sleeping behavior." The apron prevents the porpoises from sinking down to the lower recesses of the net where they may become entangled.163 The regulations have other important provisions concerning fishing and porpoise rescue techniques. Under the regulations, a minimum of two manned speedboats must be in the water until backdown commences to pre- vent the net from collapsing. The backdown must be continued until it is no longer possible to remove any live mammals from the net. Also required are a minimum of two rescuers engaged in hand rescue of live marine mammals until all of them have been removed from the net. The regulations prohibit the use of a sharp or pointed instrument to remove any marine mammal from the net. The regulations also require launching into the net a rubber raft suitable as a porpoise observation and rescue platform from which a crewman must use a facemask and snorkel to determine that all live marine mammals are out of the net.

ANALYSIS OF CONSERVATION EFFORTS The emphasis of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, or any other legislative or dip- lomatic effort to conserve Cetaceans has been the management of them to foster their growth and development so that they will remain a viable marine resource. Implicit in this espoused purpose is the management of Cetaceans as an economic resource. These conservation efforts, therefore, have not been instituted to protect Cetaceans for the sake of Cetaceans, but for the sake of man. Two questions must be asked at this juncture: (1) Is it right to look upon these magnificent, intelligent, and sentient Cetaceans as resources to be managed and exploited for man's purposes? (2) Are we presently capable of managing Cetaceans so that they may continue to remain a viable marine resource to man, while inflicting the smallest number of adverse effects upon the Cetacean population as a whole? The reader must search his own heart to answer the first question. An analysis of the present state of the art will help provide an answer to the second question. Management of wildlife species consists of two elements - one human and one nonhuman. Regulation of the human element to serve the needs of wildlife management seems simple enough. Politics and economics aside, regulation of human activity can be accomplished through enforceable legislation. Regulation of the nonhuman element is a much more complex problem. Factors of the nonhuman element include habitat protection, predator control, disease eradication, food supply, optimum population size, minimum sustainable population size, carrying capacity of the habitat, and the effects of intra- and interspecies interactions. The science of ecology is relatively new, and man is just beginning to discover how complex the interrelationship of living things to their environ- ment really is. This awareness has led to a new humility among scientists. Although biologists have achieved a measurable degree of success in breeding some species of wildlife and stimulating the populations of some land animals, they concede that, "wildlife populations cannot be managed with the same precision as domestic populations. We have no direct control of natural mortality (which determines survival) from birth to the age of reproduction which is one of the most critical factors in managing a wildlife species."163 Management of Cetaceans is even more difficult than terrestrial wildlife due to the constraints placed upon the wildlife managers by the aquatic environment. It is crucial, therefore, for man to obtain a better '"42 Fed. Reg. 64,548, 64,557 (1977). tt$1972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 249.</page><page sequence="30">578 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL. XII, NO. 4 understanding of Cetaceans before any attempt be made to manage them. For years, biologists ignored the biological differences between Ceta- ceans and fishes when making management decisions affecting the Ceta- ceans. Fish biology differs from that of Cetaceans in many ways, but most importantly in the contrasting ability of these animals to react to changes in the size of their populations. All animals tend to produce more offspring than can subsist in the environment indefinitely. The population of a species reaches a point when a pressure is exerted by the environment, a so-called environmental resistance. This environmental resistance creates physiologi- cal or behavioral changes or both within the animal to reduce the rate of birth or to increase the rate of death. The population, therefore, will fluc- tuate around a level where, all factors considered, it is at a size which is best suited for that particular habitat. The range within which the population fluctuates is called the carrying capacity of the habitat. Responding to a serious depletion in their population size, animals will: (1) change their re- production behavior; (2) trigger enzymatic or hormonal changes within their bodies; (3) affect a social change, i.e., change in herd size, to facilitate breeding, or (4) reduce natural mortality.166 Because of their high rate of fecundity and capability of laying thou- sands or millions of eggs, most commercial fish can rapidly adjust to drastic reductions in the size of their populations.167 Cetaceans, however, exhibit a very low fecundity and have strongly developed parental behavior. If Ceta- cean populations become depleted, it may take several generations to recover since females bear only one calf at a time. Additionally, if a lac- tating female is killed, her dependent calf will probably die as well.168 Extinction is the most serious result of man's inability to manage either himself or the species. Examination of the populations of species of animals that have been driven to extinction in the recent past indicates that there is some level, a critical minimum population size, below which a species could not naturally survive in its habitat. What this critical level is depends upon the particular species. Being social animals, Cetaceans may have relatively high critical minimum population sizes.169 The precise size, or even an estimate, of the critical minimum popula- tion is just one of the pieces of information so important to Cetacean man- agement that is lacking. As Dr. Roger Payne of the New York Zoological Society has said, "Many of the most crucial considerations of the breeding biology of whales are almost unknown, whereas, of course, for domestic animals they are known in minute detail."170 We remain ignorant of such basic information as: (1) how many Ceta- ceans there are today of each species; (2) how many Cetaceans there were of I&lt;67077 House Hearings, supra note 5, at 424. 167Scarff I, supra note 1, at 582. l"1975 House Hearings, supra note 71, at 102. 169Scarff I, supra note 1, at 389. il01972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 132.</page><page sequence="31">TOWARDS EFFECTIVE CETACEAN PROTECTION 579 each species before the advent of man's large-scale exploitation; (3) the basic population dynamics of Cetaceans; (4) the role that a healthy Ceta- cean population plays in a functioning marine ecosystem; and (5) the effects of man's degradation of the marine environment upon Cetaceans. To effectively manage Cetacean populations wildlife managers must have accurate estimates of the total yearly mortality inflicted by man. Yet such an estimate, no matter how accurate, is meaningless unless put into the context of the total population size. To date, there are no accurate estimates of total populations and no immediate prospects of obtaining them.171 Almost as harmful as no knowledge is a profusion of grossly inaccurate or purposely distorted knowledge. Most of our current knowledge concern- ing whales comes from scientists employed by the International Whaling Commission. Dr. Theodore J. Walker of the Scripps Institute of Ocean- ography points out that the IWC scientists, "owe their livelihood to the whaling companies, and it should not be embarrassing to them to acknowl- edge their bias towards whaling."172 The data that these scientists generate have formed the basis of most management decisions regarding the "harvesting" of whales. The blue whale unit (b.w.u.), the very basis of IWC quotas throughout most of its history, was decried after its abolishment in 1971 as "scientifically un- sound."173 As a result of the utilization of such erroneous data, the Blue Whale was killed to near extinction,174 and the populations of most com- mercially exploited whale stocks have been significantly overestimated.175 These difficulties inherent in Cetacean management reveal some of the problems in the institutional attempts at managing Cetaceans. One of the major problems of the IWC is that it purports to serve two "masters," and that the goals of those masters are incompatible. The preamble of the Inter- national Convention for the Regulation of Whaling recognizes "that it is in the common interest to achieve the optimum level of whale stocks."176 But a major goal of the Convention is to "make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry."177 Arguably the IWC does not try to serve two masters at all, but rather serves only one - the whaling industry. All of the species of whales supposedly protected by the IWC are seriously endan- gered.17' The Asiatic Gray Whale has disappeared entirely and the largest colony of "protected" Southern Right Whales was wiped out "to the last mother and infant" in 1962 by a whaling fleet off the southwest coast of Africa.179 The three main hunted species-Fin, Sei, and Sperm Whales- are 17 xId. at 406. 172 1971 House Hearings, supra note 5, at 132. •"Christo!, et al., supra note 9, at 151. i741972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 301. 175 Scarff I, supra note 1, at 366. l16Id. at 353. i71Id. at 354. l7t1972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 365. ll9Id. at 255.</page><page sequence="32">580 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL.

Frequently, the delegation of a nation to the IWC is composed of representatives of that na- tion's whaling industry. The president of the Japanese Whaling Associa- tion, for example, is also a delegate from Japan to the IWC.181 Because a member nation can formally object to an IWC amendment and thereby not be bound by it, and because a member can withdraw from the Convention, controversial conservation measures have been diluted or withdrawn in response to a nation's threat to withdraw or formally ob- ject.182 The following incident from a 1974 meeting of the Scientific Com- mittee is illustrative of this point: There had been considerable discussion about the recommended quotas for Minke Whales in the Antarctic. The Japanese had come to the meeting with an estimate of the number of Minke Whales that was twice the previous year's estimate. On that basis, they in- sisted that the Minke quota of 5,000 from the previous year, which in any case had been exceeded, be raised to 12,230. The Scientific Committee dis- agreed with the Japanese estimate and supported the 5,000 quota. A sug- gested reason for the Japanese to change their figures was that their in- dustry required 5,000 Minkes and that they had previously agreed to the quota of 5,000 not realizing that the Russians were also going to take Minkes. With the Soviet involvement, therefore, the only way for Japan to assure its take of 5,000 was to produce estimates that were double the base population. The Japanese representative, irritated and frustrated by the Commit- tee's refusal to accept the higher estimate stated: "It is embarrassing for me to say this, but my government plans to take this many Minke Whales and what does the Committee think about this?" Whereupon an American representative said: "Do you mean to tell this Committee that your govern- ment has decided in advance what number of whales they are going to catch this coming year and that you are asking this Scientific Committee to en- dorse your industry's prior decision?" A scientist from a Southern Hemi- sphere country jumped to his feet, hit the table, and said: "Why, that's criminal." Whereupon another scientist replied: "What do you think they have been doing in here all along?"183 The inability of the IWC to effect meaningful conservation programs to protect the whales has been summarized by J.L. McHugh, the former chairman of the IWC: "•Id. at 365. •"Christo!, et al.t supra note 9, at 154. '"Scarff I, supra note 1, at 357.

Seventeen nations currently hunt whales, but only eight of these belong to the IWC. Major nonmember whaling nations include: the Bahamas, Chile,185 Peru, the People's Republic of China, Portugal, Somali Republic, and Spain.116 There is at least one "pirate whaler" registered in Liechtenstein, flying under the Angolan flag, and labeling its meat for sale to Japan as "Product of Spain." This whaler is reportedly killing hundreds of endangered Sei and Bryde's Whales.187 In South America a large whaling operation, started by a Norwegian, is developing and registers its whaling ships as "fishing boats," thus escaping all IWC regulation.188 Even though this non-IWC whaling accounts for only 2 to 3 percent of the total Baleen oil production and 4 to 8 percent of the total sperm oil pro- duction, it threatens to deplete or drive to extinction certain stocks.189 Although the 1975 quota for Sei and Bryde's Whales in the eastern South Pacific was 198, Peruvian whalers took 545 Sei and Bryde's Whales.190 It would be inaccurate to say that the MMPA has been ineffective in preventing the mortality of Cetaceans incidental to commercial fishing operations. But it also is inaccurate to say that the MMPA is meeting the goals mandated by Congress. The tuna industry was given a two-year ex- emption from the provisions of the MMPA during which time it was to develop the technology and the techniques to reduce the incidental kill or serious injury to marine mammals to "insignificant levels approaching zero."191 During the three years following the expiration of the two-year ex- emption, the tuna industry reported mortalities of 99,000 for 1975; 135,000 for 1976; and 104,000 for 1977. 192 Although this averages to a yearly reduc- tion of about 73 percent from pre-MMPA yearly mortalities, these figures are far from levels approaching zero. In fact, since the United States fleet exceeded its 1976 quota by 33 percent without suffering any conse- quences,193 the fact that the quotas promulgated for 1978, 1979, and 1980 are decreased by about 10,000 deaths per year194 is of little significance if (1) ll4Christol, et ai, supra note 9, at 155. x%i1972 Senate Hearings, supra note 2, at 366. lt6See U.S. Dep'tof State.

Other defects also exist in the principal protective legislation and its regulations which must be examined. It is important to note that the MMPA is a management statute. The similarity between the policy state- ment of the MMPA and the preamble to the IWC is somewhat ironic. The MMPA provides that marine mammals should be "encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible,"193 whereas the preamble to the IWC states "that it is in the common interest to achieve the optimum level of whale stocks."196 Attainment of the MMPA policy is assigned to the Department of Commerce which has been charged with overseeing Cetacean conserva- tion. Unfortunately, that department always has been more interested in ex- ploitation of a resource than in its protection. The conclusion seems inevit- able that Cetaceans will never be protected for their own sake. Under the present scheme Cetaceans are considered as nothing more than an exploit- able resource. The regulations specify that a vessel may not encircle either pure or mixed schools containing members of depleted stocks or species. The regu- lations, however, will permit a vessel to continue its set even after it has been ascertained that members of a depleted stock or species will be encir- cled, once a set has, in good faith, begun. For several reasons that exemp- tion from civil or criminal penalties is wrong. First, it may be difficult to distinguish between a depleted and a nondepleted species. Second, only 1 1 percent of the United States Yellowfin tuna catch on porpoise that include Eastern Spinners (a depleted species). And only 20 percent of all Yellowfin taken are in connection with mixed schools.197 These facts indicate that tunamen should not be allowed, under good faith or otherwise, to set on schools containing depleted species while avoiding civil or criminal penalties. Given the serious lack of knowledge and the proliferation of inaccurate data, the greatest margin of safety should be built into all calculations re- garding population estimates. Towards this end, the use of the midpoint in the range of the lower bound of optimum sustainable population in the test for depletion, as specified in the regulations,198 is unacceptable. Consistency with the policy consideration that marine mammals should be "encouraged to develop to the greatest extent feasible," requires that any doubt be resolved in favor of the mammals. As such, the lowest estimated value should be utilized, not the midpoint. This will result in the greatest margin of safety in all population calculations.

Under the pres- ent scheme, it would be impossible to invoke civil or criminal penalties for exceeding the quota when a number of vessels return to port simultaneous- ly. Given the current state of radio communication, it would be an easy matter to require ships to make daily reports via radio. Employing this reporting method, the regional director could prevent the yearly quota from being exceeded. This would have a secondary and salutary effect of reduc- ing the amount of paperwork required by the certificate holder, assure more accurate mortality statistics, and reduce the incidence of unreported mortal- ities. A defect of the quota itself concerns its lack of specificity. Although the regulations for 1977, 1978, and 1979 are species and stock specific, quotas based on sex and age are lacking. Even the IWC has minimum length requirements. Sets upon schools of immature Cetaceans may have drastical- ly detrimental effects upon the local population. Similarly, taking inor- dinate numbers of females, pregnant or otherwise, is likely to have detri- mental effects. Although legal assessment of imprudence often is based on an objec- tive * 'reasonable man" standard, the regulations do not follow the dictates of our common law based legal system in evaluating the conduct of tuna- boat operators. Rather than judging the prudence of the operator for in- itiating a set under adverse conditions by a reasonable man standard, i.e., by looking at what the typical operator would have done under similar cir- cumstances, the regulations allow the operator subjectively to set his own standard.200 Under this scheme, it would be impossible to impose civil or criminal penalties upon an operator who initiates a set under conditions which would prevent effective use of backdown and other required porpoise rescue procedures. Thus, the operator faces no consequences for initiating a set under conditions which are likely to produce a great number of mor- talities. It is reasonable to assume that, all things considered, the newer and bigger the vessel and its equipment, the safer the set will be. Similarly, the older and more dilapidated the vessel or the smaller the vessel, the less apt it will be to cope with the problem set caused by detrimental conditions of wind or sea. In disregard of this logic, the regulations require only the larger and newer vessels to be equipped with a Porpoise Apron in the backdown channel.201 This refinement of the net has proven itself to be very efficient in preventing mortality during backdown. The added expense of this net re- finement should be part of the cost of engaging in purse seining on por- poise. i99Id. at 64,553. *"Id. at 64,555. 2OlId. at 64,556.</page><page sequence="36">584 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL. XII, NO. 4 One of the major defects of the regulations, and indicative of the lack of true commitment to protecting the Cetaceans, is the failure to make on- board observers a condition to the permit. Impartial observers are critical for the gathering of scientific information as well as for assuring com- pliance with the Act and its regulations. It has been shown that fishermen without observers are reporting one-sixth202 to one-tenth203 the porpoise kill that is reported by boat observers. Currently, the regulations indicate that an attempt should be made to place an observer on 130 trips.204 This repre- sents at best only 33 percent of all the trips per year of the United States tuna fleet.205 No efforts at all are being made to place observers on board foreign vessels that obtain permits under the MMPA. Permits must be made conditional upon the applicant's assent to take aboard a government-provided observer. Financial arrangements should be devised whereby the tunamen would defray in toto or in part the costs of in- stituting a 100 percent observer program. A mandatory observer program must also be instituted by the IWC for there to be effective compliance with its regulations. Once a whale gets aboard a factory ship and goes through the grinding wheels and its butchery, there is no way to tell one whale from another. There is every reason to suspect that Japan and Russia are capturing endangered species. Only by requiring whaling ships to take aboard an impartial observer will the world know that endangered species of whales are safe from exploita- tion. Both the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act exempt Alaskan natives from prohibitions on taking of Cetaceans, endangered, threatened, depleted or otherwise.206 Such an exemption for whatever purpose, is un- conscionable. The Bowhead Whale is unquestionably the most endangered species of whales. This species was among the first to receive protection from commercial whaling.207 It is currently estimated that there are as few as 1,000 Bowheads remaining. If the recruitment rate for Bowheads is the same as other Baleen whales (4 to 7 percent), then only 40 to 70 whales will be born each year.208 Compare this with the fact that the Alaskan natives have killed an average of 30 whales per year with a high of 48 in 1976.209 Because very little is known about this species' critical minimum population size, the relatively small catch of the natives stands a good chance of causing the Bowheads' extinction. The natives themselves have come a long way from the days of hand-held harpoons and dog sleds. Native whalers are now 202 1977 House Hearings, supra note 14, at 178. 2O3Id. at 56. 20442 Fed.

No longer are the natives dependent upon the whales for food and energy because of the availability of alternate supplies.210 To permit the taking of an endangered species for the ' 'purposes of creating and selling authentic native articles of handicrafts and clothing,"211 is totally unacceptable. Not- withstanding the fact that the Secretary of Commerce under the MMPA or the Secretary of the Interior under the Endangered Species Act can revoke this exemption upon a proper showing for cause, the exemption continues. Because of the unreliability of population data and the lack of knowledge of the species, it is imperative that the most expedient form of protection be applied to these whales. Revocation of the exemption by statutory amend- ment would seem to be the most expedient course of action. Such an action would have an important secondary consequence of significance to all species of whales. By eliminating this exemption, the United States government will place itself in a more persuasive position to encourage the major whaling nations to curtail their exploitation of Ceta- ceans. No longer will such whaling nations be able to chide the United States for not practicing what it preaches. Since the whaling nations are not dependent upon the American market, the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act have been unsuccess- ful in limiting worldwide whaling simply by closing the American market. Additionally, applying the Pelly Amendment is not likely to achieve the desired result if applied to Cetacean conservation programs. The United States simply does not import substantial quantities of fish or fish products from Japan or the Soviet Union to exert any significant impact upon their industries if an embargo is invoked. An amendment to the Pelly Amend- ment, the MMPA, the Endangered Species Act, or all of them which would allow the president, upon certification of the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Interior, to invoke a trade embargo, prohibiting the impor- tation of any goods manufactured, produced, grown, or processed by a country engaged in activities in contravention to Cetacean protection, will provide the United States with significant clout to assure that Cetaceans around the world are suitably protected. Protective legislation which affords no enforcement is no protection at all. The critical need for mandatory observers to assure compliance has been discussed above. The recent court decision in United States v. Mitch- ell,212 severely undermines the effectiveness of the MMPA and may similar- ly impair the Endangered Species Act. In Mitchell, the defendant was an American citizen who had been convicted of violating the MMPA by cap- turing dolphins within the three-mile territorial limit of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The court of appeals held that Congress did not intend for U0Id. at 402. 21I16 U.S.C. § 1371(b)(2) (1976). 212United States v.

XII, NO. 4 the MMPA to extend its regulation to the territory of other sovereign states and reversed the defendant's conviction. The court emphasized that "the statute does not attempt to define the geographical extent of the morato- rium."213 To overcome the general presumption against extraterritorial application, the statute or its legislative history, according to the court, must provide a "clear expression of congressional intent for application of the Act in foreign territories."214 The enforcement of the MMPA and the Endangered Species Act must extend to foreign territories. This is particularly true in light of the "black market" for the sale of porpoises which has recently developed. The in- creased popularity of dolphins has created a shortage of them for the world's oceanariums. Apparently, there are few proficient porpoise catch- ers outside of the United States. As a result, European markets will pay an experienced American dolphin catcher between $5,000 and $10,000 for a healthy specimen. Payoffs have been reported as high as $23,000.215 With such monetary incentives, it is certain that the number of illegal takings of dolphins and other Cetaceans will increase. The MMPA and the Endan- gered Species Act should be amended to extend their jurisdiction to United States citizens wherever situated. The Acts should apply to Americans act- ing on the high seas, within the territorial seas of the United States and its possessions, within the territorial seas of foreign jurisdictions, or even upon foreign soil where many of these illegal transactions transpire. V. STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION Currently, there exists no adequate protection for Cetaceans. Legislative ef- forts which are designed to manage marine mammals are inherently flawed. Management schemes provide protection to Cetaceans only to the extent of their usefulness to man. No recognition is given to the right of these creatures to exist, irrespective of man. Naturalist Joseph Wood Krutch has written: The wisest, the most enlightened, the most long-seeing exploitation of resources is not enough for the simple reason that the whole concept of exploitation for man's use alone is false and is so limited that in the end it will defeat itself. The earth will have been plundered under that form of conservation and laid waste, no matter how scientifically and how far-seeing the plundering and the waste has been accomplished. Something is fatally lacking in that concept of conservation and the thing lacking is the feeling for, or the love of, the natural world of which man is a part.216 Man has been given his chance to protect the magnificent Cetaceans, but with little success to date. The large whales may soon vanish from the face of the earth, and the smaller Cetaceans may not be far behind.

Man, for all his technological abilities, has not learned how to synthesize a whale. Once a species of Cetaceans disappears, it will be lost forever. It is for these reasons that a new commitment must be made, not to manage whales, but to manage man. It is imperative that the worldwide killing of Cetaceans for any purpose be banned. There should be a complete moratorium on the tak- ing of Cetaceans either directly by or incidentally to commercial operations. There is not a single human use of Cetaceans which justifies their kill- ing. Any product derived from Cetaceans may presently be derived from an alternative source. With increased expenditures for research, the mighty Sperm Whale hunted for its oil may soon be replaced by a common desert shrub called "jojoba" that produces seeds from which an oil is derived that is virtually identical to Sperm oil. Jojoba may soon be commercially har- vested and marketed at the currently prevailing prices for Sperm oil.217 The Japanese claim that they must be allowed to continue killing Ceta- ceans because of the scarcity in Japan of animal protein. The Japanese cite figures that whale meat accounts for about 6 percent of their total supplies of meat products. They claim that if Cetaceans are lost to them as a protein source, it would be necessary to import an estimated 220,000 tons of beef and over 290,000 tons of pork, making Japan's beef imports account for 12 percent of the total volume of the world's beef trade.211 It is curious to note, however, that although the Japanese assert their need to kill Cetaceans as a protein source, the Sperm Whale accounted for about 40 percent of Japan's 1972 catch,219 but Sperm Whale meat is inedible. It is also interesting to note that Japan exported in 1977 an estimated $740 million worth of fish or fish products. An estimated $79 million of this total estimate probably reflects whale exports.220 Utilizing a 1975 estimate of the worth of Baleen whales ($190/ton), the Japanese exported in 1977 roughly 400,000 tons of whale meat. Compare this figure with the 123,000 tons earmarked for domestic Japanese consumption221 and the Japanese argument justifying the hunting of whales for protein loses credibility. Furthermore, even if protein were an important consideration, increased developments in aquaculture, or so- called fish farming, could easily make up the protein deficit caused by deny- ing the Japanese the privilege of hunting Cetaceans.222 It is not the technology or the ingenuity that is currently preventing aquaculture from obtaining its potential, it is the uncertainty caused by an absence of an inter- national law of the sea which has scared away investment in this field. The promulgation and acceptance of an enforceable international law of the sea 217Note, supra note 11, at 214. 21 »Christo!, et. al, supra note 9, at 164. 2 "Note, supra note 11, at 215. 22OReview of Fisheries in O.E.C.D.

XII, NO. 4 will go a long way towards the protection of Cetaceans by virtue of its encouragement of ocean fisheries. Similarly, Cetaceans need not be killed incidental to commercial tuna fishing activities. The American demand for tuna can be met without killing a single Cetacean. Approximately 80 percent of all tuna eaten in the United States comes from Albacore or Skipjack tuna which is not associated with Cetaceans.223 This tuna provides what is commonly known as "white" tuna. Of all Yellowfin, or "light" tuna, only about 50 percent is caught in association with Cetaceans.224 Employing simple mathematics, it becomes evident that only 10 percent of all tuna consumed in America is caught with the incidental killing of Cetaceans. Certainly the tuna industry could survive if it were required to cease setting on Cetaceans. The 10 percent deficit in total tuna catch could be compensated by increased efforts on Albacore or Skipjack, or by setting on more schools of Yellowfin not associated with Cetaceans. In view of the fact that "light" tuna is usually less expensive to purchase in the store than "white" tuna a federally imposed tax on "light" tuna to raise its price on a par with "white" tuna should reduce the number of consumers buying "light" tuna in favor of "white" tuna. The revenues generated by the tax could be used to further Cetacean research or they even could be funneled back to the tuna industry to help reduce its dependence upon Cetaceans. Utilization of recent developments in fishing techniques may substan- tially reduce the number of Cetaceans encircled incident to tuna fishing. If these developments prove effective, they should be required of all permit holders under the MMPA. The following is a brief listing of these recent developments: 1 . The broadcasting of amplified Killer Whale sounds underwater has resulted in the "active" escape of dolphins through the backdown channel which is preferable to the "passive" escape currently util- ized;225 2. The use of mechanical surrogate dolphins which are employed to lure a school of tuna away from the real dolphin school and into a net;226 3. The use of buoyed floats strategically placed throughout the ocean under which the tuna will congregate;227 and 4. The visual and acoustical reproduction of a dolphin herd under which tuna will congregate and then be led into a net.228 If a complete moratorium of the killing of Cetaceans is not adopted, measures must be taken to assure their healthy survival.

Man- agement strategies must be devised for each species employing the best in- formation available. It should be the espoused policy of any management scheme that action will not be taken on any proposal unless and until the ef- fects upon the species and ecosystem of the proposed action are known. Any management scheme should incorporate the four general principles drafted by scientists attending the "Airlie House Workshops" in 1975. 1 . The ecosystem should be maintained in a desirable state such that: (a) con- sumptive and nonconsumptive values can be maximized on a continuing basis; (b) present and future options are ensured; (c) risk of irreversible change or of long-term adverse effects as a result of use is minimized. 2. Management decisions should include a safety factor to allow for the facts that knowledge is limited and institutions are imperfect. 3. Measures to conserve a wild resource should be formulated and applied so as to avoid wasteful use of other resources. 4. Survey or monitoring, analysis and assessment should precede planned use and accompany actual use of wild living resources.22' It should be noted that the nonconsumptive uses mentioned above in- clude use as a tourist attraction; as the "star" or subject of television pro- grams, popular record albums, or movies; and as the subject of artists in all media. A conservative estimate of the value of all nonconsumptive uses ex- ceeded $225 million in 1976.230 None of the so-called protective institutions currently applies these principles. There is a need for the abolishment of the IWC and the creation of a wholly independent international agency with no vested interests. The decisions affecting all Cetaceans, large or small, should be made by an agency representing all nations, whaling or otherwise. The full force of international persuasion should be employed to assure that the decisions of this body are enforceable against all. The United States may impose the above recommended trade sanctions against any nation which fails to join or abide by this newly created agency. If incidental taking of Cetaceans as a consequence of commercial fishing is permitted to continue, the fishermen also should be given incen- tives to further reduce mortality within the law. Of the 130 purse seiners, only a very small percentage is responsible for the majority of the kills. Eighty percent of the total mortality of Cetaceans occurs in only 20 percent of all sets.231 This fact alone indicates the industry's ability to significantly reduce mortality. It is recommended that an incentive system be incor- porated into the MMPA under which vessel owners will be required to pay an increasing fee based on the number of Cetaceans they take. This ascend- ing fee scale will have the effect of financially weeding out the inept crews "'Scarff I, supra note 1, at 396. »•Id. at 342. 1U1975 House Hearings, supra note 71, at 61.</page><page sequence="42">590 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL. XII, NO. 4 and ill-equipped vessels while permitting responsible crews and well- equipped ships to remain operating. Industry self-policing as well as train- ing seminars should be encouraged to eliminate incompetent crews. It is of paramount importance that for Cetaceans to survive under man's management, they should be given their own legal rights. They should be given a qualified right to protect themselves in a court of law when institutions established for the purpose of Cetacean protection fail to achieve their goals. Cetaceans, on the basis of their high degree of intelli- gence, their highly complex social structure, their sentience, and their ability to communicate, deserve to be accorded treatment preferential to all other animals. They should have access to the court through legal guardians to assert their interests. Legislation should be enacted which will give Ceta- ceans standing to sue in court to protect themselves. Alternatively, a new tort at common law should be created on behalf of Cetaceans. The common law should recognize Cetaceans as holders of enforceable legal rights be- cause they deserve to be protected and because they are not adequately pro- tected by present criminal statutes. As strange as such a course of action may seem at first glance, this very concept was argued by Justice William O. Douglas in his dissenting opinion in Sierra Club v. Morion. "2 In his opin- ion, Justice Douglas stated that the voice of the natural object should not be stilled. Permitting a court to appoint a representative of natural object "would not be significantly different from customary judicial appointments of guardians ad litem, executors, conservators, receivers, or counsel for in- digents."233 VI. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS 1 . A worldwide moratorium on the taking, harassing, hunting, injur- ing, or killing of all Cetaceans for commercial, exploitative pur- poses should be adopted. 2. The greatest possible application of political and public pressure must be utilized to effectuate and enforce such a moratorium. 3. The science of aquaculture must be developed to the greatest ex- tent possible to produce fisheries that will provide resources to meet the world's protein demands. 4. Man should dedicate himself to continuing Cetacean research to learn as much as possible from these magnificent creatures. If the above moratorium is not instituted, the following recommendations should be adopted. 5. The International Whaling Commission should be abolished and replaced with a wholly independent international agency. The new agencv should protect all Cetaceans under the principles drafted during the Airlie House Workshops. "'Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 749 (1972).

Multinational and bilateral treaties should be negotiated to assure that the proposed international agency will be recognized by all whaling and nonwhaling nations and to assure compliance with its policies and decisions. 7. A mandatory international observer system must be incorporated into any management schemes instituted by the proposed agency. 8. The president of the United States should employ all means at his disposal to encourage membership, recognition, compliance, and enforcement in connection with such an agency. 9. To facilitate the president's power of persuasion in this and other matters concerning Cetacean protection, the Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman's Protective Act of 1967, the MMPA, and the En- dangered Species Act of 1973 should be amended to allow the president to invoke a trade embargo, prohibiting the importation of any goods manufactured, produced, grown or processed by a country engaged in activities that are in contravention to interna- tional Cetacean protection programs. 10. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 and the MMPA should be amended to extend their jurisdiction to United States citizens, wherever they are located, i.e., whether they act on the high seas, within the territorial seas of the United States and its possessions, within the territorial seas of foreign jurisdictions, or upon foreign soil. 1 1 . The provision exempting Alaskan natives from the prohibitions of the Endangered Species Act and the MMPA should be revoked. 12. The MMPA should be amended to discontinue the issuance of per- mits which allow the taking, harassing, hunting, injuring, or kill- ing of Cetaceans incidental to commercial fishing operations. If recommendation No. 12 is not adopted, the following recommendations should be acted on for effective protection of Cetaceans. 13. The MMPA should be amended to transfer the Department of Commerce's authority of Cetacean management to the Depart- ment of the Interior. 14. The general principles developed by the Airlie House Workshops should be incorporated into the MMPA. 15. The current regulations promulgated by the Marine Mammal Commission should be modified as follows: a. The lowest estimated value of a population should be utilized in computations concerning a stock or species depletion. b. Tunamen should not be allowed to encircle mixed schools con- taining or suspected of containing individuals of a depleted stock or species. c. Permits must be made conditional upon the operator's accept- ance of a government observer on board. The industry should</page><page sequence="44">592 NATURAL RESOURCES LAWYER VOL. XII, NO. 4 be responsible for reimbursing the government, either in toto or in part, for the cost of maintaining observers. d. The presence of an observer must be required for each and every trip of each purse seining tuna vessel. e. Tuna vessels must be required to radio their daily catch statis- tics to the regional director reporting both Cetacean injuries and mortalities. f. Quotas should be age and sex specific as well as species and stock specific. g. The prudence of operators initiating a set under adverse condi- tions must be judged on a reasonable man standard. h. All vessels, regardless of size and age, must be equipped with a Porpoise Apron in the backdown area. Similarly, once the Marine Mammal Commission recommends the use of a new technique or apparatus proven to save Cetaceans, the whole purse seining fleet must be required to employ such a develop- ment. 16. A federal tax should be imposed on the retail sale of "light" tuna to raise its retail price on a par with "white" tuna. The revenues generated by the tax should be used to further Cetacean research or to help the tuna industry reduce its dependence upon Cetaceans. 17. The tuna fishermen should be encouraged through economic in- centives to reduce their dependence upon Cetaceans and to reduce Cetacean injury or mortality. Economic incentives may include public boycotts of tuna products, specifically light meat tuna, or an ascending fee scale incorporated into the MMPA regulations which penalize incidental takings of Cetaceans. 18. Cetaceans should be given qualified legal rights to protect their in- terests in a court of law when man's other institutions have failed adequately to provide Cetacean protection. There is a dire need for immediate and effective action to protect all Cetaceans. The most effective recommendation is a worldwide moratorium on taking, harassing, hunting, injuring, or killing of Cetaceans for any pur- pose except valid scientific research and humane public display. The eco- nomic consequences of a moratorium are far outweighed by the benefit to humanity of protecting these beautiful, majestic, and intelligent creatures from extinction. Some day when man learns to establish communication with our aquatic counterparts, the sacrifices made today will become eclipsed by the myriad of benefits which will result from such an associa- tion. Perhaps the whale will teach man the true meaning of humanity.</page><page sequence="45">TOWARDS EFFECTIVE CETACEAN PROTECTION 593 APPENDIX The Large Whales ORDER: CETÁCEA Suborder: Mysticeti FAMILY: Malaenidae General Characteristics: Has large head relative to body size.

It spends its summers in colder waters migrat- ing to subtropical waters for winter to breed. Prefers coastal waters. Maximum Size: 46 feet; 51 tons. Food: Mainly krill, but occasionally fish. Special Characteristics: This whale, with its chunky appearance, is particularly known for its apparent joie de vire. Participates in a variety of acrobatic activities including jumping out of the water and falling backwards waving its long flipper. The famed songs of the Humpback recorded in its mating grounds are further testimony to this whale's unusual character.

Maximum Size: Approximately 40 feet; 20 tons. Food: Copepods and small fish. Suborder: Odontoceti (toothed whales) FAMILY: Physeteridae General Characteristics: This family contains only one species- the Sperm Whale-- the whale immortalized in Melville's Moby Dick. Species- Physeter catodon Sperm Whale, Cachalot Range: Widely distributed throughout the oceans of the world. There is no mingling of Northern and Southern Hemi- sphere populations. Maximum Size: 54 feet; 61 tons. Food: Fish, large sharks, squid, and octopus. Special Characteristics: The morphology of the whale has been popularized by fiction. The blunt-ended head acquires its unique shape from bones which grow out from the skull to form a box which contains an oily substance, spermaceti. Today this substance remains very valuable to commercial whaling. Source: D.J. Coffey, Dolphins, Whales and Porpoises (1977).</page></plain_text>
