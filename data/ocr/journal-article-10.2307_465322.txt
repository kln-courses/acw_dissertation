"POSTAL SURVIVAL, OR THE QUESTION OF THE NAVEL." The Lesson of Paul de Man, Yale French Studies 69 (1985): 49-72. ["PS"] A number of modem writings reflect on the relation between sexuality and textuality, between gender and hermeneutics. Possibly the most important of these is Sigmund Freud's analysis of the dream of Irma's injection, found in chapter 2 of his Interpretation of Dreams. This "specimen dream" is the foundation not only for Freud's theory of dream interpretation but also, in a sense, for psychoanalysis itself [Felman, "PS" 57; Chase 192]. If we are to understand anything at all about our modes of interpretation and the way that gender difference bears on them, then we must consider this dream, which provides crucial insights into woman's place and function in textual hermeneutics. The German text and the English translation of the dream follow: Eine grosse Halle-viele Gdste, die wir empfangen. -Unter ihnen Irma, die ich sofort beiseite nehme, um gleichsam ihren Brief zu beantworten, ihr Vorwiirfe zu machen, dass sie die "Losung" noch nicht akzeptiert. Ich sage ihr: Wenn du noch Schmerzen hast, so ist es wirklich nur deine Schuld.-Sie antwortet: Wenn du wiisstest, was ich far Schmerzen jetzt habe im Hals, Magen und Leib, es schniirt mich zusammen.-4ch erschrecke und sehe sie an. Sie sieht bleich und gedunsen aus; ich denke, am Ende iibersehe ich da doch etwas Organisches. Ich nehme sie zum Fenster und schaue ihr in den Hals. Dabei zeigt sie etwas Strduben wie die Frauen, die ein kiinstliches Gebiss tragen. Ich denke mir, si hat es doch nicht noetig.-DerMundgeht dann auch gut auf, und ichfinde rechts einen grossen Fleck, und anderwdrts sehe ich an merkwiirdigen krausen Gebilden, die offenbar den Nasenmuscheln nachgebildet sind, ausgedehnte weissgraue Schorfe.-Ich rufe schnell Dr. M. hinzu, der die Untersuchung wiederholt undbestdtigt....

[GW 2/3: 111-12] A large hall-numerous guests, whom we were receiving.-Among them was Irma. I at once took her on one side, as though to answer her letter and to reproach her for not having accepted my "solution" yet. I said to her: "If you still get pains, it's really only your fault." She replied: "If you only knew what pains I' ve got now in my throat and stomach and abdomen-it's choking me."- I was alarmed and looked at her. She looked pale and puffy. I thought to myself that after all I must be missing some organic trouble. I took her to the window and looked down her throat, and she showed signs of recalcitrance, like women with artificial dentures. I thought to myself that there was really no needfor her to do that.-She then opened her mouth properly and on the right Ifound a big white patch; at another place I saw extensive whitish grey scabs upon some remarkable curly structures which were evidently modelled on the turbinal bones of the nose.-I at once called in Dr. M., and he repeated the examination and confirmed it.... Dr. M. looked quite differentfrom usual; he was very pale, he walked with a limp and his chin was clean-shaven.... Myfriend Otto was now standing beside her as well, and myfriend Leopold was percussing her through her bodice and saying: "she has a dull area low down on the left." He also indicated that a portion of the skin on the left shoulder was infiltrated. (I noticed this, just as he did, in spite of her dress.).... M. said: "There's no doubt it's an infection, but no matter; dysentery will supervene and the toxin will be elimi- nated." ... We were directly aware, too of the origin of the infection. Not long before, when she was feeling unwell, my friend Otto had given her an injection of a preparation of propyl, propyls . .. propionic acid... trimethylamin (and I saw before me the formula for this printed in heavy type).... Injections of that sort ought not to be made so thoughtlessly.... And probably the syringe had not been clean. [SE 4: 107]. Much of Freud's initial interpretation of the dream is involved in understanding how the patient he calls Irma turns out to be a figure for several other women. First of all, as Freud recalls examining Irma's throat in the dream, he realizes that "What happened in the dream reminded me of an examination I had carried out some time before of a governess.. ." [SE 4: 109]. Then, the way in which Irma stands by the window reminds Freud of having seen "an intimate woman friend" of Irma's standing by a window. Freud has "a very high opinion" of this woman; he suspects that she is a hysteric, and his suspicion has been confirmed by Irma; moreover, he suspects that this friend of Irma's would be somewhat resistant to treatment, at least partly because she was capable of being "strong enough to master her condition without outside help" [SE 4: 110]. Finally, in returning to the "few features that [he] could not attach either to Irma or to her friend: pale; puffy; false teeth," Freud initially attributes the false teeth to the first figure behind Irma (the governess), but by substituting "bad teeth" for "false teeth," he arrives at an association that explains the presence of paleness and puffiness as well. This is a third figure, whom Freud identifies in a footnote as his wife [SE 4: 110n]. Having identified these three figures behind Irma, Freud goes on to state the kind of comparison among the figures that the dream encourages: diacritics / summer 1990 21</page><page sequence="3">Thus I had been comparing my patient Irma with two other people who would also have been recalcitrant to treatment. What could the reason have been for my having exchanged her in the dream for her friend? Perhaps it was that I should have liked to exchange her: either Ifelt more sympathetic towards her friend or had a higher opinion of her intelligence. ForIrma seemed to mefoolish because she had not accepted my solution. Her friend would have been wiser, that is to say she would have yielded sooner. She would then have opened her mouth properly, and have told me more than Irma. [SE 4: 110-11] And as the woman opens her mouth, the text shifts to the footnote in which the comparison of the three women is stated again but also declared to be problematic: I had the feeling that the interpretation of this part of the dream was not carried far enough to make it possible to follow the whole of its concealed meaning. If I had pursued my comparison between the three women, it would have taken me far afield. There is at least one spot in every dream at which it is unplumbable- a navel, as it were, that is its point of contact with the unknown. [SE 4: 111 n] The metaphor of the "navel of the dream" appears again in the final chapter of The In- terpretation of Dreams: There is often a passage in even the most thoroughly interpreted dream which has to be left obscure; this is because we become aware during the work of interpretation that at that point there is a tangle of dream-thoughts which cannot be unravelled and which moreover adds nothing to our knowledge of the content of the dream. This is the dream's navel, the spot where it reaches down into the unknown. The dream-thoughts to which we are led by interpretation cannot, from the nature of things, have any definite endings; they are bound to branch out in every direction into the intricate network of our world of thought. It is at some point where this meshwork is particularly close that the dream-wish grows up, like a mushroom out of its mycelium. [SE 5: 525] Freud tells us that there are questions that must be left unanswered, strands bound in a confusing knot rather than a neat bundle. Samuel Weber rightly asks how the interpreter knows when he or she is confronted by such an impasse [78]. Our knowledge of Freud leads me to believe that we may find that the answer to this question is inscribed in Freud's dream narrative and in his interpretation of the dream.1 When Freud writes in his footnote that he has not "pursued [the] comparison between the three women," who are the three women to whom he refers? Jacques Lacan provides a slightly cryptic answer, since he is interested in drawing out the triads that abound in this dream, rather than identifying the individual figures within them. He refers to the trio of women as "le trio mystique" ["the mystic trio"], and says, "Les trois femmes, les trois soeurs, les trois coffrets, Freud nous en a depuis demontre le sens. Le demier terme est la mort, tout simplement [The three women, the three sisters, the three caskets, Freud has since shown us its meaning. The last term is death, as simple as that]" [Le moi 189/Ego 157]. In contrast with the "mystic trio" is a "trio of clowns" [Le moi 187/Ego 156]: Dr. M, Otto, Leopold. And Lacan delights in presenting the formula for trimethylamin, first as 1. See Frank 110: "No one can more insightfully tell us how to read Freud than Freud himself." 22</page><page sequence="4">CH3 AZ CH3 CH3 and then in a more elaborate form where the articulation of triads is even more obvious and where there is the suggestion that the progression of triads could be expanded ad infinitum [Le moi 189-90/Ego 158]:2 H C H / ~~ H / ^-^ H AZ C H \^ ^^ H H C H H Although readers generally recognize that Irma is a composite figure, representing "herself, the friend of hers that Freud wanted to treat, Freud's eldest daughter, a woman patient killed by Freud, a child from the Kassowitz Institute, a governess who tried to conceal her false teeth when examined by Freud, and lastly Martha" [Anzieu 151], the impulse to organize these figures into a ternary structure is very strong-and all the more so, given that it appears to be fully authorized by Freud's text. Thus, some readers identify the three women "recalcitrant to treatment" [SE 4: 110] as Irma, Freud's wife, and Irma's less recalcitrant friend [Anzieu 149; Felman, "PS" 59-60; Chase 195]. Didier Anzieu even goes so far as to suggest that the formula for trimethylamin "neatly fits Freud's childhood in Freiberg" and thus provides Freud with an explanation of his origins; in it, are encoded "three couples (the Zajics, Emanuel Freud and his wife, and, more recently, Jacob and Amalie Freud) and their respective children," along with the common denominator in each of these families, Monika Zajic [ 146]. Proceeding along these lines, Anzieu then offers yet another elaboration of the pattem found in the formula [149]: Irma The Widow Irma's friend Martha Breuer Freud His Elders Fleischl Emanuel \~ ^_^_- Otto \ His Equals Leopold Fliess 2. In English, the symbol for nitrogen is N, while in French it is AZ. Lacan comments, "On peut s'amuser sur l'alpha et l'omega de la chose. Mais quand bien rnme nous aurions N au lieu de AZ ce serait la meme calembredaine-nous pourrions appeler Nemo ce sujet hors du sujet qui designe toute la structure du reve [One can play around with the alpha and omega of the things. But even if we had N instead ofAZ it would be the same nonsense-we could give the name Nemo to this subject outside the subject who designates the whole structure of the dream]" [Le moi 189/ Ego 159]. diacritics / summer 1990 23</page><page sequence="5">24 II</page><page sequence="6">We should be wary of such specific identifications. Freud does not elaborate on the identities of the figures he traces, and Lacan deftly circumvents such an exploration, even as he draws the reader to meditate on the identities of the figures who take up their positions in the ternary structure. We should be especially wary because Freud has already told us that such queries can take us far afield. This is the site of the navel, the point at which Freud stops in his tracks. Or rather, Freud stops and does not stop. And if we do the same, we will see what is happening here, instead of filling in the cryptogram so that it "makes sense." In allowing the number three, so crucial in this dream, to crystallize, Freud surrenders to a kind of distortion of the actual female figures. This turns out to be the logical spot for this operation, since as the dream interpretation goes on and Freud recalls other women behind Irma (such as the patient named Matilde whom Freud inadvertently poisoned, and whose name brings to Freud's mind his daughter Matilde), identifying a triad of women would become increasingly difficult. The navel thus identifies the site of crucial knowledge-knowledge gathered through analysis of symbolic relations-which is bound up with and peculiarly disconnected from knowl- edge that can only obfuscate interpretation. In bringing forth the symbolic reading, the interpreter must perforce gloss over figures that do not fit neatly into the system of triads. One of the most interesting of such figures is the governess, the first figure of whom Freud thinks when he realizes that Irma is a stand-in for someone else, and who occurs to him a second time as he puzzles over the physiognomic details he feels he has not yet fully explained. Anzieu, for example, claims that the most important female characters are "the three recalcitrant patients, Irma, her friend, and Martha"; for him, "the governess with false teeth plays only a minor role" [138]. Like Anzieu, Shoshana Felman also takes the triad of women to be composed of Irma, Irma's friend, and Freud's wife, although she uses another rationale to dismiss the importance of this figure: she collapses Irma and the governess, so that Irma is "doubled ... by the image of another young woman patient, a governess . .." ["PS" 59]. We can clarify the interpretive knot here if we seize the opportunity to consider what is at stake. Lacan's uncompromising summary of the cardinal points is instructive: Le reve de l'injection d'Irma, on cherchera donc d le situer comme une etape du developpement de l' ego de Freud, ego qui a droit d un respect particulier car c'est celui d'un grand createur, a un moment eminent de sa capacite creatrice.... Si ce point de vue est vrai, nous devons abandonner la notion que je vous dis etre l'essence de la decouverte freudienne, le dicentrement du sujet par rapport a I' ego, et revenir a la notion que tout se centre sur le developpement typique de l'ego. Il y a ld une alternative sans mediation-si c'est vrai, tout ce que je dis est faux. Seulement, si ce queje dis est faux, il devient extremement difficile de lire le moindre texte de Freud en y comprenant quelque chose. [Le moi 179] The attempt will be made, then, to locate the dream of Irma's injection as a stage in the development of Freud's ego, an ego which has a right to a certain respect,for it is that of a great creator, at a highpoint of his creative capacity.... If this point of view is true, we will have to abandon the notion I tell you to be the essence of Freudian discovery, the decentring of the subject in relation to the ego, and to return to the notion that everything centres on the standard development of the ego. That is an alternative without mediation-if that is true, everything I say is false. Except, if what I say is false, it becomes extremely difficult to read the slightest of Freud's texts and understand anything in it. [Ego 148 (modified trans.)] diacritics / summer 1990 25</page><page sequence="7">26</page><page sequence="8">Our conception of the relation between subject and ego determines our ability to understand the astoundingly revolutionary character of Freud's writings, which Lacan describes earlier as a twentieth-century equivalent of the Copernican revolution [Le moi 11/Ego 3]. No doubt, Lacan's polemic is directed at the ego psychology of Heinz Hartmann and Erik Erikson (whose interpretation of the dream of Irma Lacan will implicitly and explicitly revile). Lacan correctly adjudicates there to be two camps between which there can be no possible compromise on principles. Unfortunately, the polemic with ego psychology seems also to have discouraged those who believe in Lacan's truth from reading Erikson's interpretation of the dream of Irma carefully and critically, with an eye to what it can tell us about the relation between textual interpretation and the theories we base upon it. Among the various commentators on the dream, Erikson is the one who first insisted most obviously and most forcefully upon the necessity of examining the verbal texture of Freud's extremely complex dream narrative [23-27, in particular]. His analysis focuses on a series of illuminating details that are lost in James Strachey's English translation: the use of familiar address ("du") on the part of both Freud and Irma; the sexual associations of the phrase "sie hat es doch nicht notig" ("she does not need it");3 the castrating impulse behind the description of Dr. M as "bartlos" ("beardless"); the peculiarity of the term "unmittelbar" ("with a sense of immediacy"), which Freud adopts in order to express the examiners' awareness of the origin of Irma's infection; Otto's use of a"Spritze" (translated as "syringe" but meaning also "squirter"); and of course, the ambiguity of the dreamer's statement "empfangen" ("we receive," "we conceive, we get pregnant"). Erikson's sensitive attention to verbal texture seems to have been forgotten these days, while psychoanalysts and theorists who disagree with the limiting conclusions Erikson drew from his initial data present their opponent as a bad reader. Both Lacan and Felman treat Erikson in a rather dismissive manner; he serves, to some extent, as a straw man for their counterarguments. They highlight those aspects of his argument from which they distance themselves; they imply that his arguments are reductive, inasmuch as Erikson attempts to see the issues in the anthropomorphic terms of "a woman" (usually a prudish Victorian woman) rather than the figural terms of "female difference" [Le moi 184-87/Ego 153-55; and Felman, "PS" 63-64]. Erikson's limiting conclusions are understandably irksome to those who see the limitations of ego psychology. But the rapidity with which we distance ourselves from ego psychology should not lead us to a precipitous dismissal of any sort of interpretation that arises from within its camp. It is helpful to try to back up, to examine the particular textual evidence that Erikson cites, and to see how it substantiates his claim that the dream defends and affirms Freud's creative ego. In order to understand what Erikson got out of the dream, we need to reread the dream with an eye to what he may have overlooked. There are other suggestive meanings we might add to his list.4 On the right, the dreamer finds in Irma's throat a big white patch ("einen grossen Fleck" [GW 2/3: 112]). If Irma is "spotted" ("gefleckt," or in a more figurative sense, "befleckt"), it could well be her own fault ("Schuld"), as the dreamer has already told her. But the dreamer's words boomerang and he must face the charge that he is the one who is "schuldbefleckt" ("disgraced, dishonored, stigmatized"); and just to 3. Erikson, who claims that the phrase is incorrectly translated as "she does not need them (the dentures)" rather than "she does not need it (the resistance)" [11] does not seem to notice that the "it" of the English translation refers back to the German singular noun for "artificial teeth" ("kiinstliches Gebiss," or, more literally, an "artificial bite"). (Later, in the dream analysis, Freud uses "falsche Zaihne" [GW 2/3: 114].) This does not detract from the fact that Erikson does well to register the ambiguity of the phrase. 4. See also Avital Ronell's discussion of the verbal texture of the dream [48-55]. diacritics / summer 1990 27</page><page sequence="9">bh;}'JJ</page><page sequence="10">show that the fault ("Schuld") might also be his, the pain attacks him in the logical place, that is, in his shoulder ("Schulter"). In his commentary on the dream, Freud writes: "A portion of the skin on the left shoulder was infiltrated. I saw at once that this was the rheumatism in my own shoulder, which I invariably notice if I sit up late into the night. Moreover the wording in the dream was most ambiguous: 'I noticed this, just as he did. ...' I noticed it in my own body, that is" [SE 4: 113]. That dull pain in the left shoulder ("an der linken Schulter") turns out to be the "link" between Irma and Freud, a link that shows Freud that perhaps he was not so right after all, or that even with right on his side, he is still overlooking something (a missing link). But there remains an urge to free oneself of the blame either by attributing the cause of the ill elsewhere or by finding a remedy for the ill. In a later passage of The Interpretation of Dreams, the poison is associated with a gift Otto had brought, a foul-smelling pineapple liqueur. Oddly enough, Freud does not appear to notice that the dream had already pointed this out: the German "Gift" (which translates into English as "poison, toxin, virus, venom") needs only to be seen in an English context in order to give up a latent meaning that is, in a sense, on the surface.5 Just as the strawberry Freud offered his daughter Mathilde when she was ill with diphtheria caused a fit of coughing which dislodged the membrane and therefore saved her life, the toxin will be eliminated. The possibly dangerous solution ("Losung") is also a "losend" (a "solvent, expectorant, purgative"). Now, do these two commentaries on the dream's verbal texture have different ideological casts? I think so. In order to emphasize how the dream functions as a defense of the ego, Erikson focuses primarily on three factors: the sexual current running between Freud and Irma, the dreamer's desire to castrate both Dr. M (now beardless) and Otto (whose possession of the squirter-syringe makes him a "little squirt"), the unmediated nature of the dreamer's perception, and-in final, and presumably most important, position-the affirmation of the dreamer's creativity ("we receive, we get pregnant") [24-27]. The suggestive elements I have added bring out another aspect of the dream: Freud's insistence on the correctness of his judgment; his assumption of the pain and blame; and his attempt to absolve himself of pain and blame by insisting that the potential poison is really a potential remedy. In short, the dream of Irma functions, as Freud says it does, as a defense (albeit a contradictory one); but the dream's status as defense is somewhat shaky. We will see why if we take care to examine the grounds on which the defense is established. In attempting to discover the meaning of the composite figure of Irma, Freud oscillates between two kinds of associations. On one hand, he is attentive to physiognomy (the dream Irma who is pale and puffy; the dream Irma who acts as if she has false teeth; the dream Irma who suffers pains in her throat, stomach, and abdomen), which leads him, by both positive or negative association, to a particular triad of women: the dream Irma, the governess, and Freud's wife. These are women who bashfully retreat, in an attempt to conceal their mouths, their teeth, their pains. When Freud focuses on "positioning" rather than "physiognomy," a different configuration of three women emerges: Irma, the governess, Irma's friend. These are women whom Freud has examined, or who have been examined in his presence and whom he would like to examine (as in the case of Irma's friend, whom Freud recalls having been examined by Dr. M). For the dreamer, emphasizing position and taking one's distance from physiognomy seem to mean reading symbolically, taking one's distance from relations constructed within the realm of the imaginary. Here, obviously, the interpreter can draw upon a tradition of reading for the 5. Freud was sometimes attuned to the way in which words can oscillate between different languages (as I suggest "link" and "Gift" do here). But we are now more sensitive to this kind of approach, obviously, in the light of Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok's The Wolf Man's Magic Word. diacritics / summer 1990 29</page><page sequence="11">Spirit rather than for the Letter. Reading symbolically seems to be necessary to the affirmation of the dream of Irma as the Dream of Life; taking one's distance from the imaginary appears to be an attempt to dispel the threat of Death. Things are not so simple. The literal and the allegorical (and the imaginary and the symbolic) cannot be so neatly distinguished.6 It is true that when Freud isolates in a footnote the reference to his wife and says that further such exploration would lead him far afield, it may seem that he is warning us against the introduction of inappropriate literalizing information (just as Lacan suggests this in his own seminar on the dream, in which he summarily ignores Mme X's explanation that Irma may be "tied up in knots" because women of her era were accustomed to wear laced corsets) [Le moi 185/Ego 153]. But in the end, the stumbling block is not Freud's wife, not merely the personal, biographical antecedent given a literal twist. The stumbling block par excellence is the governess. The interpreter struggles to make four women three, and the signs are apparent in the text. Freud says "Thus I had been comparing my patient Irma with two other people who would also have been recalcitrant to treatment"; he speaks of his comparison of "three women"; his footnote about his wife draws attention to this "third figure" behind Irma. The point is not only to allow the triadic structure to crystallize but also to exclude the governess. In excluding the toothless governess, the dream-interpreter can eliminate a more frightening possibility: that these women patients are not simply recalcitrant to treatment; that they do not just refuse to accept his solutions; but that they are a significant threat. The governess must be eliminated from the tripartite structure in order for the dream to function as Freud says it does, namely, as a defense. She puts the defense of the ego into doubt, for she stands as the figure of impossible extrication: the deconstructive figure of the woman patient who could reveal as much about Freud as he reveals about her.7 The English translation of Freud's commentary on the governess reads, "This led to recollec- tions of other medical examinations and of little secrets revealed in the course of them- to the satisfaction of neither party" [SE 4: 109]. Those "little secrets" are more important than they may seem at first, especially since the German text says that they are "kleine Geheimnisse, die dabei, keinem von beiden zur Lust, enthiillt werden" [GW 2/3: 114, emphasis mine], thus suggesting a deadening of the erotic charge that is so ever-present in the relations with the other three women who come to Freud's mind after this memory association (Irma, Irma's friend, and Martha). The reciprocal exchange-now devoid of 6. This is true not only for the reading of the figure of Irma but also for the psychoanalytic conception of the ego. Without delving into the complicated debate on metaphor and metonymy, we may at least note the ways in which metaphor and metonymy govern psychoanalytic conceptions of the ego. Jean Laplanche summarizes these positions [134-36]. the metonymical line takes the ego to be "a differentiated organ, the executive agent of the totality it is derivedfrom, and is charged with insuring the rights of that totality prevail" [134]; it remains in continuity with the organism of which it is a specialized appendix. The metaphorical line takes the ego to be not only the organ of the personality but also an instance or agency within it; and Laplanche adds, "To be sure, this agency is constituted in successive phases representing so many deposits or 'sedimentations,' all of which, however, correspond to imprints or introjections of external images" [135]. In the light of Freud's statement that the ego is not merely a surface but also the projection of a surface /The Ego and the Id, SE 19: 26], Laplanche argues that a clear line cannot be drawn between metonymical and metaphorical conceptions of the ego. 7. It probably isn't by chance that the crucial deconstructive figure here is a governess, given Freud's relation to his childhood governess (who stole money and other objects which she hid in a "box" or coffer and who was then "boxed off' herself) and the ways in which the outcome of this relation conditioned Freud's relation to his mother. See Freud's discussion of the incident in "Childhood and Screen Memories" in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life [SE 6: 49-52] as well as Stephan Broser's analysis of this passage in "Kdstchen, Kasten, Kastration." 30</page><page sequence="12">the libidinal link that establishes and guarantees the dreamer a position in relation to the female object of masculine desire-threatens the autonomy and centeredness of the ego. Upon coming to this conclusion regarding the dreamer' s relation to the (deconstructive) figure of the governess, I sense a plausible explanation for the striking sexiness of the language in several recent critical readings of the dream of Irma. It seems to me that these critical readings, carried out by several scholars whose prime interest is in literary theory, can offer us further insight into the sexual and textual politics of this dream. The sexiness is not the sexiness of a female object of desire (be it the woman patient or the dream to be interpreted); nor is it the sexiness of death. True, the dream does establish and reinforce the link between feminine sexuality and the abyss, between feminine sexuality and the threat of death, or, as Avital Ronell would have it, between mouth and monster [51]. But the sexiness of critics' language is also meant, I suspect, to ward off aphanasis itself. One of the boldest and most intriguing readings of Freud's passage is Shoshana Felman's "Postal Survival, or The Question of the Navel." According to Felman, Freud stumbles on the riddle of femininity, which calls into question the precepts on which his interpretation of human psychical life is based; she therefore chooses to focus on Freud's relation to women in the dream about Irma and to read the undecidability of the dream's meaning alongside another question that psychoanalysis leaves unanswered, "What does a woman want?" The power of Felman's interpretation coexists with certain grave pitfalls, to which Felman herself calls attention by including with her analysis of the Irma dream a critical response Paul de Man made to her essay. Felman proposes de Man as the deconstructive other that shows the assumptions-assumptions about the workings of gender, desire, and texts-that regulate her reading; he exposes the blindness that lies entwined in Felman's insights by adding that the figure of the navel (which Felman throughout twists into an exclusively feminine property) is androgynous. In reading Felman's essay here, we shall see how its muffled articulation of desire can lead us toward a better understanding of hermeneutics and gender. There is a piece of the dead master to be had-and the essay written in memoriam for Paul de Man tries to tell us who has it.8 To begin with, Felman publishes two writings by de Man that were, presumably, never written for publication. She retrieves his introduc- tion to Lacan before it can become a piece of litter; reverent of the sublimity of the dead, she publishes it as a text "too beautiful, too rich not to seize here the opportunity of first publishing it in its entirety" ["PS" 50]. And later in her essay, she publishes a letter that de Man wrote to her shortly before he died; there de Man responds to her reading of Freud's dream of Irma. Felman builds her theory of textual interpretation on what I would call "a dream of de Man," just as Freud built a theory of dream interpretation on his dream of Irma.9 8. The notable exception isJacquesDerrida, Memoires for Paul de Man. Derrida raises many issues that are also raised in Felman's essay. His essays are engaged in a profound metacritical reflection on death, memory, and mourning; his use of personal material is exceptionally measured and humble; and his awareness of the pitfalls of his public mourning is patently evident. 9. I intentionally call Felman's essay a commentary on a "dream," even though some readers might object that this is not literally the case. I do so because her essay participates in a particular sort of "dream interpretation" (or, by extension, in reflections on the hermeneutic insights to be gained from the analysis of subjective autobiographical experience) that Freud inaugurated with the dream of Irma. This genre of writing can be found also in Jane Gallop's Reading Lacan ("The Dream of the Dead Author" and "Postory" [157-87]). While Gallop is interested in the transference that takes place when a readerldreamer creates a text to be interpreted, Maria Torok focuses on the way in which the text is already there in the personage on whom the meditation isfocused. See her "Introduction" and "Melanie Mell." Since Torok assumes "que Melanie Mell est un conte [that Melanie Mell is a fictive story]" [212], she diacritics / summer 1990 31</page><page sequence="13">Felman's essay is intensely erotic-as perhaps would be any essay that begins first with an epigraph from Rilke, as quoted by de Man, "I love you, gentlest law..." [Felman, "PS" 49, quoting de Man, AR 49]. Although Felman does not choose to reveal the specific origin of the quotation from Rilke (his Book of Hours), the information is relevant; we might say that for Felman the quotation is a selection from a Book of Ours. (This is all the more reinforced given Rilke's poem, where, as de Man notes, there is a near perfect symmetry from which any third party is excluded [AR 29].) Who speaks here? Felman? de Man? Rilke? This confusion that arises from quotation, from the juxtaposition of critical voices, is inherent to this written text-to all written texts-and it continues as a fatal force throughout the essay. The navel of the dream is-precisely-about this undecidability, the paradoxical inability to read created by the entanglement of strands. When de Man writes to Felman, there is also a peculiar eroticized touch that appears when he presses on Felman's interpretation of the question of the navel: "'My only question,' writes de Man, 'arises, if I dare say, at the level of the navel ...'" ["PS" 58]. Felman renders the phrase even more suggestive by adding an ellipsis, which effects a figure of reticentia. Some pages later, the reader discovers that the original text carries no such elliptical and provocative trace: My only question arises, if I dare say, at the level of the navel. What should we do with the manifest bisexuality of that mark, which separates as much as it unites, and which escapes the difference between the genders? The navel is a knot that's cut, and as such, more philosophical than analytical. But it was necessary first to get to that point, and you have done it with all the force and the precision one might desire. ["PS" 68] Felman' s shadowed relation to the erotic charge of this passage gives us pause. While she introduces a provocative tone with her initial ellipsis, she never comments explicitly on the risque insinuations in de Man's question (or on the way in which de Man's language evokes eros in order to make us stumble over it).10 Seeking to disempower the reading that takes sexual difference as the central issue, she declares: "the level of the navel out of which de Man addresses me with his question is, paradoxically enough, the very level of identity between de Man and me: the level not of sexual difference but of the identity of a self-difference (of a difference from ourselves), out of which we can, indeed, listen to each other, hear each other, resonate with the other's work" ["PS" 70]. Agreed, sexual difference is not the point. But refusing to surrender to the reassuring sexual liaison does not guarantee the elimination of desire. Or to put it even more plainly, to grant that sexual relations between two human beings are not a legitimate object of textual study does not therefore imply that we cannot speak of the desires that inhabit the textual world of their work. What desire-and what interdiction of it-might be determining some of the discursive choices of this essay? Our gaze must turn, then, not to de Man and Felman but to the text Felman provides. Indeed, she invites our gaze there. She has furnished the reader with only her own English translation of a portion of the letter from de Man. Earlier in the essay she had provided de Man's introduction of Lacan in both French original and English translation, thus revealing implicitly that the partial communication of de Man's text was not strictly necessary. She thus retains a double portion of de Man which she does not share-and she leaves the revelatory clues in full sight. can also see the dreamlstory as revelatory of something beyond the transference ofa given dreamerl reader. 10. For an eye-opening analysis of this characteristic aspect of de Man's writing, see Neil Hertz, "Lurid Figures." 32</page><page sequence="14">Moreover, Felman's English in a crucial part of this letter (dated [Maine], August 23, 1983) appears to graft an idea of "man-ness" or "maleness" onto an encrypted French original. In the translation, de Man declines to entrust his letter to the "the singularly decrepit mailman who insures postal survival in this place" and promises to put the essay in Felman's "mailbox" at a later date ["PS" 68]. "Mailbox" is what we might call a "marked term," since it appears in place of "box," the standard semantic choice in similar situations at Yale (and probably in many other academic environments). To speculate further on the encrypted French original might be fraught with danger, but pausing over these phrases is imperative; the site occupied by the mailman is clearly marked as significant, given that Felman lifts the phrase "postal survival" for her own title. We may wonder if Felman is attempting to play on de Man's name, which would not be surprising in a writer like Felman who is especially attuned to the "call of the phoneme" [cf. Culler]. But Felman seems to have other ways of figuring the morphemes of de Man's last name. These are generally drawn from de Man's own writing, where the principal signature does not involve play on man or male [mail] but on the entire last name (deman [d]) or on its first morpheme (dem). Felman quotes de Man who describes reading as an "allegory of [the] demise" of the dead, who states that "all texts narrate the impossibility of reading as the point of failure out of which they demand to be read," or who acclaims Jacques Lacan (at least in Felman's translation) as "one of those who know language's uncanny power to refuse the truth that nonetheless it never stops demanding."'1 Felman admits that the blind spot of her vision lies, as de Man points out, in the superimposition of sexuality in her rhetorical equation "navel = (female) knot." I suspect, then, that the presence of man and male/mail in the English translation forces us to reconsider Felman's articulation of difference and identity. In order to see what sort of difference I am getting at, we need to consider the figures that populate Felman's text and the way in which they are organized. While in Freud's analysis of the dream of Irma's injection the tripartite structure dominates, in Felman's essay, it is the number two that arises in order to emphasize the symbolic exchange between two critics around a literary text (or, more metaphorically and metonymically, the letter). In order to make this relation of twoness crystallize, all other figures (anthropomorphic or textual) have to be conflated within the current of knowledge that passes through de Man and Felman over the literary text. One way in which Felman accomplishes this operation is by avoiding mention of other readers who have discussed the dream of Irma and the navel of the dream: thus, there are no references to Lacan's discussion of the Irma dream in the Seminaire or to Jeffrey Mehlman's essay on trimethylamin.'2 From the moment in which Felman provides the first text by de Man, namely his introduction to Lacan, we can easily see that the other way to accomplish this 11. Felman, "PS" 49, 53-54, and 51 [repeated on 54], respectively; the emphasis on "the point offailure out of which they demand to be read" is Felman's. Such a play on "de Man" seems to be extended to other critics as well. One obvious place to lookfor a range of possible play is the largest collection of essays on de Man's writing, Responses [ed. Hamacher, Hertz, and Keenan]. Two contributors who seem especially sensitive to the play on de Man's name are Richard Klein and Jeffrey Mehlman. Klein's title, "De Man's Resistances: A Contribution to the Future Science of De Manology, " points toward the diabolical, which he then investigates via the "deManic." In his essay, Mehlman notes that "the intertextual contamination deconstruction all but demands between de Man's two "revolutions" (of the 1940s and the 1970s) is open to a restricted-or remetaphorized-reading we should do well to confront at the outset" [324]. The emphasis on demands is Mehlman's and accentuates the near homonymy with "de Man's," which hovers nearby. Interrupting the play on "Man" isthe ever-present refusalto give in to anthropomorphization in de Man's work, which is tantamount to the demand for reconsideration and reading. 12. The omission seems particularly striking since, as Chase notes, Mehlman's essay "remains the most powerful and concise account of the theoretical stakes of the Irma dream analysis" [205]. diacritics / summer 1990 33</page><page sequence="15">is to realize a wished-for genealogy that includes Lacan and Poe. De Man's words of introduction communicate "vehemently and laconically what was crucially important in his eyes."'3 His text becomes for her a "purloined letter" of introduction, a kind of rich and beautiful "Poe-try," about which Lacan, Author of the seminar on "La lettre volee" ("The Purloined Letter")-not to mention Felman herself, who knows this text well- would have much to say [Lacan, TPL; Felman, "ORP"]. Felman appears to be invoking the symbolic circuit that Lacan declares is established by the various relations that various subjects take up with respect to the radical subject, the letter. When de Man decides not to press upon the "fatal impression of a repetition" he alludes to that "Seminar on the Purloined Letter." Most important, we should not discount the postal infiltration here of Mehlman, our translator of this Seminar. The presence of Lacan and Mehlman in Felman's encrypted references to the "Seminar on the Purloined Letter" appear thus to cover over the notable absence of Lacan and Mehlman in the context of analyses of the dream of Irma. The exclusion of "the singularly decrepit mailman" at the very moment of mention of "postal survival" has the effect of requiring Mehlman's exclusion. And lest I be misunderstood, let me clarify: Mehlman is here merely the name for a translation- effect. In other words, de Man's exclusion of the mailman (and Felman's concomitant nonreference to Mehlman) is tantamount to an attempt to interrupt the infinite and problematic relays of signification that always seem to end in chaos and death. Paul de Man's introduction to Lacan, Paul de Man as text, is not alone in determining the subject positions of those in its proximity. There is an absent figure that motivates the economy of desire, namely, Rousseau. When I first read the description of Felman "seizing" the opportunity to publish de Man's words, something in the affective charge of this moment reminded me of the moment in book 3 of Rousseau's Confessions where he describes his excessive behavior inspired by his love for his beloved Maman, Mme de Warens. He offers several examples, which culminate in the one I cite here below: Un jour a table, au moment qu'elle avoit mis un morceau dans sa bouche, je m' ecrie quej'y vois un cheveu: elle rejette le morceau sur son assiette,je m'en saisis avidemente et l'avale. [C 108] One day at table, just as she had put some food into her mouth, I cry out that I see a hair in it. She spits the morsel back on her plate; I seize it greedily and swallow it. [CC 108, modified trans.] I have questioned-and continue to question-the aptness of linking these two moments from Rousseau and Felman (despite the fact that Rousseau is not entirely absent from Felman's essay and was also a privileged locus in de Man's work).14 But at the very least, putting the two passages together is useful because it points to something peculiar about the way in which Felman and Rousseau make temporality a crucial issue. Rousseau's verb tenses change in order to make the experience of his folly immediate; the cry "je m'6crie" doubles for "je m'ecris; and the moment of oral incorporation is also the moment of validation ("[je] l'avale": "I swallow it" and also, as a pre-nineteenth-century form now 13. In contrast, the description of Lacan as "ironic" gives him a demanian cast [cf. Felman, "LP" 98, 100]. 14. Rousseau makes his presence felt at the very beginning, when Felman asks, "How can we accountfor the lesson of this extraordinary teacherfor whom reading was a true vocation, a genuine profession, but whose way of professing reading, whose 'profession de foi'-or 'allegory of reading'-was paradoxically enough, the statement that 'the impossibility of reading should not be taken too lightly' (AR 245)?" [ "PS" 49]. It is Rousseau, and de Man who reads Rousseau, who gives us some distance on the first apostrophe to a deity, in the epigraph taken from Rilke's Book of Hours. 34</page><page sequence="16">substituted by "avaliser," "I endorse it," "I guarantee its validity.") The underlying concern with writing and guarantee comes as no surprise, not since Derrida took Rousseau to indicate "neither identity nor causes" but rather "the name of a problem," which, in Peggy Kamuf's words, we could take to be the following: "the problem of a signature that cannot sign for itself, by which we mean both that it carries no guarantee of authenticity and that it cannot sign on its own.... Rousseau will find himself constrained to multiply the acts of guaranteeing with another signature what he has already signed" [Derrida, G 99; Kamuf 24-25]. Most important, the passage I cite from Rousseau's Confessions accompanies one of this author's most striking affirmations of the way in which, as Derrida has noted, "immediacy is derived" [G 157]. Mme de Warens is the supplement for the unknown mother who is already herself a supplement [G 156]. Just as Mme de Warens is the chief figure for Rousseau's sense of eros and time and memory (as we know from the Tenth Promenade in Les reveries du promeneur solitaire, as well as from other texts), so does de Man figure crucially in Felman's description of eros and time and memory in "Postal Survival." Take, for example, the following passage: "I asked him, afterwards, to let me read again this introduction. He had no intent of saving these words and gave the page to me. Rereading it today, I find it too beautiful, too rich not to seize here the opportunity of first publishing it in its entirety" ["PS" 50]. Felman's request to "read again this introduction" may strike us as merely odd, since, logically speaking, Felman could not have performed the originary reading proper to de Man himself. But it also places her already with de Man at that original reading. And her gerundial clause "rereading it today" reinforces the sense of dislocation. When is this "today"? Is it determined by the act of "writing"? By Felman's act of "reading"? Or by the reader's act of reading? Felman's "dream of de Man" is-in line with Rousseau-a stuttering dream "de maman," a dream of "demande" in the face of a "dead de Man" and a dead "demande." Her essay, the account of an attempt to be possessed of the dead de Man, enacts the failure to do so, the faltering move away from love that ends with the cutting of the knot. Beginning with de Man's most probing question about the navel, "My only question arises, if I dare say, at the level of the navel," Felman utters it three times-first by citing it in the body of de Man's letter, then by repeating it twice in the course of her gloss on de Man's response ["PS" 68, 69, 70]. This pattern of triple repetitions holds also for the two subsequent demanian statements, which thus intertwine on themselves and on Felman's commentary on them. In these repetitions, we hear the painful, broken scream of Orpheus for the lost Eurydice, of Dante for Virgil; we hear the last attempt at a magical incantation that might return the loved one to us.15 The confusion of voices present here (though not for the first time, as I have already noted) is resolved momentarily in the final sentence of the essay, when Felman repeats, seemingly in her own voice, the statement that "The navel is a knot that's cut." Throughout the essay, we have been witnesses to a working through. The final sentence extends proof that the operation has been successful. The knot is cut, cutting de Man, cutting Felman, free. Felman's and de Man's commentaries on the navel of the dream are profitably read alongside that of another reader, Samuel Weber, who remains wary of answering the riddle that Freud poses. The differences in these essays are worth exploring somewhat further, simply because they underline some crucial points about sexual difference and 15. See Virgil, Georgics 4: 525-27 ("Eurydicen vox ipsa et frigida lingua, / a miseram Eurydicen! animafugiente vocabat, / Eurydicen toto referebantflwnine ripae [the bare voice and death-cold tongue, with fleeting breath, called Eurydice-ah, hapless Eurydice 'Eurydice' the banks re-echoed, all adownthe stream]"), and DanteAlighieri, Purgatorio 30: 49-51 ("Ma Virgilio n'avea lasciati scemi I di se, Virgilio dolcissimopatre, / Virgilio a cuiper mia salute die'mi... [But Virgil had left us bereft of himself, Virgil sweetest father, Virgil to whom I gave myself for my salvation . . . ]'"). diacritics I summer 1990 35</page><page sequence="17">writing. Striking indeed is the fashion in which Weber, Felman, and de Man exploit the erotic charge of language. Weber, for whom figurative language (in Lacan as well as in Freud) makes us confront the impossibility of defining unified origins, coyly focuses on the "Thallus"-but in order to show how the ambiguous mycelium of the mushroom defies all imposition of difference. Both Weber and de Man begin with masculine flourish but then come back to the question of entanglements, intricate networks, traps (in the case of Weber, who studiously avoids the term "web"), and to the knot that is cut (in the case of de Man, whose sense of his own relation to the "knot" is not immediately apparent).16 Inscribed in Felman's critique of Freudian theories of sexual difference is a play on her own name, which both links her to de Man, to the failing de Man, and separates her from him. Throughout, she insists on the "fall" and the "failure" of teaching, provoked by the impossibility of reading that de Man professed. One of de Man's most famous examples of the impossibility of reading was, of course, the impossibility of disentangling clearly the literal and figural aspects of Keats's title "The Fall of Hyperion." The persistent play on falls and failure in Felman's essay reminds us that Freud's study of the case (German "Fall") of Irma may also be a fall, an accident, a downfall. Indeed, Freud's richly crafted text seems to be most sensitive to this conflation of meanings when he comments upon the encounter with the governess: "An diesen Fall kniipfen sich andere Erinnerungen an arztliche Untersuchungen und an kleine Geheimnisse, die dabei, keinem von beiden zur Lust, enthiillt werden [This [i.e., this case, or this fall] led to other recollections of other medical examinations and of little secrets revealed in the course of them-to the satisfaction of neither party]" [GW 2/3: 114; SE 4: 109]. In Felman's own name, of course, the Felled Man lives to fall, to fail, and in thus doing, to be.17 Given these critics' awareness of the inherent impossibilities of defining the origins of figuration, their play of figurative language is particularly instructive. For one thing, they point out how paronomasia, a rhetorical figure that reveals and conceals, that simultaneously acknowledges and forgets, can be adopted in a gendered mode. In the shifting faults created by paronomastic play, there is the vibration of difference. On the one hand, that figurative play can be inscribed with a "masculine" desire to penetrate and possess carnally. The hermeneutic model that sees the (feminized) text as an object of the (male) reader's desire to possess has traditionally been bound to a vision of rhetoric as involucrum, dress, cosmesis. Finding meaning becomes the equivalent of "undressing" or "stripping" the text. For Weber and de Man, this hermeneutic model is obviously no longer tenable, for there is no clear outside or inside in rhetoric; part of their project is to show the impossibility of disentangling the literal from the figural. For Felman, who seems to bashfully circumvent sexuality, there is yet another model for figurative language: it remains "feminine," but now it is pregnant, already possessed by another. Figurative language is inscribed with "feminine" desire to incorporate, to generate; figurative language is cryptic, and unknowable, as is woman herself. There would seem to be three cases of woman as hermeneutic model: woman as object of desire; the pregnant woman as object of another's (or her own) desire; and the pregnant woman as crypt. The 16. Were one to attempt such a commentary, which isfor the moment tangential to the project of this essay, one would also have to address the issue of the shifting subject pronouns in this translated passage. Highly relevant, then, would be Gallop's commentary on the subject pronouns and the divided subject, especially in reference to the unconscious castration complex [133-56]. Moreover, as she pointedly notes, "'Noeud,' the French word for knot, is a well-known crude term for 'penis"' [156]. 17. One wonders of course, whether Felman's freedom to play on her own name is not guaranteed by the fact that, as a woman in a patriarchal society, she bears a different relation to the patronymic than would a man. Could this explain why Felman chooses to translate and then to privilege the translation over the original (at the same time in which she sends forth an encrypted message denying the efficacy of translation and of an intermediate relay)? 36</page><page sequence="18">pregnant woman turns out to be a problematic, although interesting, figure for allegory and figurative language, for several reasons. First, there is no certain primacy of mother or fetus; the status of the "individual" is blurred. (And abortion debates in our own time have made this point all too clear.) Second, the pregnant woman problematizes possession of the phallus: since one does not remain pregnant forever-the moment of separation/castration is inevitable-the "pregnant woman" introduces the certainty of "castration." Third, the paradoxical figure of the pregnant woman as the "crypt" that gives life may be particularly appealing for postmodern subjectivity. Each of these critics puts into question the primacy of the phallus as signifier; each of them resists models of reading that have been called "phallogocentric." They evoke sexual difference so as to assign it a secondary function-a move that is crucial if we wish to remain, as de Man exhorts us to do, within the realm of the "philosophical" rather than the "analytical." My readers will perhaps be aware that my discussion of the literature on the navel of the dream is populated by representatives of deconstruction. There are of course other currents of reading, mainly psychoanalytic-biographical ones. To the extent that we can even make such a distinction, the latter readings are closer to "cultural" than to "textual" studies. They do of course have justifiable origins in Freud's own interpretation, since Freud himself does not hesitate to focus on the "day residues" either in his preamble to the dream or in the interpretation of it; and in the earliest studies of the dream, the biographical element frequently dominates (Erikson, Leavitt, Schur). Some recent studies are principally interested in the intersubjective text created by a whole cast of characters present at the founding of psychoanalysis: Freud, Freud's patients (especially Emma Eckstein), Freud's colleagues (especially Wilhelm Fliess), Freud's daughter Anna [Garner; Sprengnether 167; 171-74]. Some interpreters of the dream, particularly struck by Freud's identification with Irma, have seen the dream as Freud's attempt to deal with his bisexuality, placed in relief by the intensity of his relationship with Fliess. But the rush to "solve" the mystery of the dream by bringing it back to Freud's biography will not get us very far in the understanding of the dream' s import. To be blunt, analyses of a political and moralizing nature may exhort us to live well-an exhortation which is hard to express as well as hard to hear-but it is not always clear that they teach us how to read. The most vigilant deconstructive readers have taught us, on the other hand, that the text, as a function of language, constantly shuttles between resolution and resistance to resolution. They have taught us to beware the relation between ethics and textual politics. Faced by questions of gender, the deconstructive reading reminds us that the relation between sexual and textual politics is an uneasy one. To assume that a question such as "What does a woman want? " is a question that remains within the reassuring literal bounds of biological womanhood is to read sexual difference as primarily about sex rather than primarily about difference, and therefore to risk repeating the literalizing move on which patriarchies have capitalized. The play of sexual difference in a text evokes a series of other "sexual" currents and tensions: the relation of writing and speech, the relation between signs and referents, the relation between the object present to us and the object evoked by memory. And there is yet another crucial issue. In the Irma dream, we have already seen the tension between sexuality and the deadening of sexuality: between the attempt to keep the sexual current alive and the inevitable submission to a "reciprocal exchange" that ignores the desires of the individual parties. Trimethylamin, the chemical formula that is so prominent in the dream of Irma, provides an exemplary case in point; given that it is a product of the decomposition of sperm, it evokes a sexuality that it simultaneously dissolves. The same effect is-not surprisingly-reproduced in the deconstructive commentaries on the dream: in Weber and de Man, in their evocation of sexuality so as to give it a secondary status, and in Felman, the insistence that the "current" running diacritics / summer 1990 37</page><page sequence="19">between her and de Man is not sexual. In other words, the peculiar meditation on sexuality and textuality in these deconstructive writings obliquely points toward the peculiar meditation on textuality and sexuality that is also to be found in Freud's dream of Irma. For what these critics know-and what Freud also knows but attempts to deny by nudging the governess out of his text-is that the operations of language (and by extension, of the text) can always reveal themselves indifferent to a desire. This is the message that the text seems always to have to hide, if we are to be able to live with it. WORKS CITED Abraham, Nicolas, and Maria Torok. The Wolf Man's Magic Word: A Cryptonomy. Trans.
