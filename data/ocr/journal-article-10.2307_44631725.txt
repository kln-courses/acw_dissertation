Snyder Highway Safety Research Institute The University of Michigan IT IS ESTIMATED THAT there are currently be- tween 1.5 and 1.75 million drivers of heavy (over-the-road) trucks in the United States (1)*, although no precise number is known and some estimates are as high as 2.5 million. Of an approximate total of 28 million truck regis- trations in 1977 (2), an estimated 821,000 trac- tor-trailers (500,000 units) are over-the-road vehicles (3). Truck drivers thus represent a major occupational sub-population. Yet design practice has been to utilize U.S. general popu- lation data (4,5) obtained nearly two decades ago (6, p. 30), or apply military data (6, p.3Ö). Until 1977 (7), the only body of published U.S. truck driver anthropometry available was col- lected 30 years ago (8-11). Since heavy trucks have an operational life of about 12 years and 3-7 years are required to produce a new cab concept (6, p. 30), it is apparent that there may be a significant time lag between original design specifications and user operation. Truck cabs may be redesigned once every 10 to 20 years; one current model has not been changed since 1953 (28 years) and another since 1958. Coupled with generational increases in body size of the general population is evidence sug- gesting that truckers are larger in many dimen- sions than the general population (7,8), and that today's male truckers are larger in many dimensions than those of 30 years ago (7). New factors that must also be considered are the need to accommodate increasing numbers of fe- male truckers (12), and the conflicting econo- *Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. - ABSTRACT - Accurate data on the body dimensions of truck drivers are needed and such data are not presently available. This paper provides basic source data and an anthropometrical overview of the usefulness and limitations of existing data bases; discusses the influence of population factors, including age, sex, and demographic variables; and reviews population sampling pro- blems. Heavy truck drivers as a whole appear to represent a physically different population from that of either the U.S. general population or other professional groups. Future anthropometric surveys must provide information for improved accommodation for the increasing range of physi- cal size of users, and for obtaining data more useful to engineers involved in heavy truck in- terior cab design. 947 0096-736X/82/9001 -0947$02.50 Copyright 1982 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">948 R.

Such physical dimension factors are reflected in reports of problems of poor driver fit, reach and accommodation, fa- tigue, discomfort, and unsafe operational pro- blems. These have been documented in driver complaints to their companies, union, and Bu- reau of Motor Carrier Safety (BMCS) (6), as well as described in human factors evaluations of minimum cab dimenions (9,14,15). The purpose of this paper is to bring together anthropo- metric data relevant to truck cab design, re- view the influence of variables of population characteristics upon dimentional requirements, and discuss selected anthropometric needs for future engineering design. The need to obtain both current truck driv- er anthropometry and interior cab workspace di- mensions have been widely recognized. A recent Panel on Heavy Truck Safety, convened by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in Washington February 19, 1980, con- cluded: There are two specific tasks that must be accomplished as prerequisites to estab- lishing appropriate driver space require- ments. These are (1) a better anthropo- metric description of the 5th and 95th per- centile male driving population, and (2) a standardized test procedure and methodol- ogy for measuring pertinent cab size para- meters. (.16) A study by the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety (BMCS) February 27, 1980 recommended: 5. Anthropometric measurements of the present-day United States population need to be taken and truck and bus drivers as a group need to be included in the study. 7. Representatives of vehicle manu- facturers, vehicle users, labor organiza- tions, and the Federal government should work together to develop a standard method for taking anthropometric measurements. (6) In April, 1980, General Motors Corporation responded to the question: "What anthropometric measurements or studies are truck manufacturers using to determine the 5th to 95th percentile truck driver?", posed by the National Freight and National Automobile Transporters Equipment Study Committee, by stating: GM is unable to make recommendations in the absenceof recognized measurement procedures. . .at present, driver accommo- dation techniques rely heavily on tools and procedures developed for passenger car application. Many are applicable to heavy duty truck accommodation. (17) Driver complaints of problems such as in- sufficient clearance between the seat back and steering wheel rim have been noted by the Nation- al Master Freight Equipment Committee in recent contractual negotiations. During the past year, the SAE Occupant Dimensional Parameters Sub- committee has been actively addressing the need for an anthropometric survey and for occupant dimensioning criteria. This Committee expects to conduct a study to obtain new data for gen- erating accommodation curves for preferred seat position, steering wheel position, control pedal and driver eye location. A 1978 study by Miller and Anderson exam- ined areas of design dimensions of the cab in- terior workspace, minimum dimensions based on normal operating requirements, space required to protect occupants in a collision, and envi- ronmental factors including noise, temperature, and vibration (14). They pointed out that cab dimensions can have a profound effect on driver comfort and safety. If a driver is forced into cramped or awkward positions due to inadequate space, this causes fatigue. Moreover, perfor- mance can be adversely affected if there is in- sufficient room to operate the steering wheel, foot pedals, and other controls. This affects not only the truck driver's safety but the safe- ty of others on the highway. Besides accommodation factors, truck driver crash protection should be an important spatial consideration. In 1978, 5,015 persons were fa- tally injured in 4,235 fatal accidents involv- ing heavy trucks, accounting for 10% of all high- way fatalities and nearly 10% of all fatal high- way accidents in the U.S. that year. This was a 48% increase in fatal accidents and a 44% in- crease in fatalities compared to 1975 (32). While on a mileage basis, over-the-road trucks experience a lower crash rate than other vehi- cles, a number of reports indicate that when a crash does occur the fatality rate is consider- ably higher than for other vehicles (19,20). However, this is not unexpected, since exposure is* a critical factor in prediction of crash fre- quency (21). Exposure of control variables have been analyzed by Campbell and Carsten on a basis of vehicle type, trip distance, trailer type, carrier type, fleet size, and cab style (4). In col lisi sons of large trucks (over 26,000 lbs. GVW) and cars, 97% of the fatalities occur to the car occupants (22). In the special case of cab-under trucks, where the driver is seated in a Recaro seat at an inclined angle less than a foot above the road-bed, spatial relationships may differ considerably from either the cab-over- engine (C0E) or conventional cab designs (23). SOURCES OF ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA To assure that the interior dimensions of a cab are compatible with the occupant, it is first necessary to know basic informa ti pn concerning the body size, functional reach, and strength capabilities of the truck driver population. Un- fortunately, much existing data are limited or unpresentative of today's truck driver population. The following discussion concerns anthropometric data sources, prior applicable studies, the use and abuse of anthropometry, and problems in defining minimumal spatial dimensions of truck cabs. GENERAL U.S. POPULATION - Anthropometric data on adult U.S. c'itizens may be divided into two population categories: military and civil-</page><page sequence="3">DRIVER BODY SIZE 949 ian. In general, the differences between these two populations lie primarily in variations in size, shape, and age. While military data may not represent the civil population, the civil data are so limited that often the only source of data on a measurement will be from a mili- tary study. The military data are based upon a highly selected set of individuals in good health who fall primarily betwen the ages of 18 and 40 years, often with mean ages of 23-25 years. These data are skewed toward the lower age groups, particularly in the female data series. Table I lists the major military anthropometric surveys of the past 25 years. It can be seen that a large number of dimensions on very large samples of military personnel are readily avail- able. With information on some critical anthro- pometric dimensions in the civilian population, some of these data may be extrapolated to the civilian population. For civil ians, there are not as many major anthropometric surveys of comparable magnitude in both sample size and number of dimensions. Table II lists some currently available studies on the adult U.S. civilian population. It is important to note when reviewing the data from available anthropometric surveys that rarely, if ever, are all of the needed dimensions measured on one sample. For example, there have been many separate attempts at compiling the list needed for definition of the surface dimensions of a manikin, either for clothing and personal protection (24) or anthropomorphic test devices (25,26). These lists, in general, suggest from 76 to i 96 dimensions. A major source of concern is to determine how representative the available data are as to age, race, and sex. These factors affect vari- ation in the data and must be considered along with other demographic variables, such as place of residence, rural vs. urban, and socio-economic class in anthropometric data collected on the adult civilian population in the United States. THE HES AND HANES STUDIES OF U.S. CIVIL POPULATION - To date there have been two major anthropometric studies of the U.S. general popu- lation from ages 18 to 74 years. The Health Examination Study (HES) included data measured from October 1 959 through December 1962 on 6,672 sample subjects representing the U.S. population at that time. Anthropometry was only one of a number of examinations involved, thus only a limited number of measurements were included. The 12 measures taken consisted of weight, height, sitting height (erect), sitting height (normal), knee height, popliteal height, elbow rest height, thigh clearance height, but- tuck-knee length, buttock popliteal length, el- bow-to-elbow breadth, and seat breadth. Re- sults of portions of these data have been pub- lished in several HEW reports (4.5), but the basic document is Weight, Height, and Selected Body Dimensions of Adults - United States 1 960- 1962 by Stoudt, Damon, and Me Fari and (1965) (4).

Between the ages 18-74, 13,671 persons were measured, although to date only height and weight data are avail- able. Erect sitting height, elbow breadth, seated breadth, chest girth, head girth, and skinfold measurements will be available at some time in the future. Thus fèw body measure- ments will be available from this study. Some findings of the latter study show that the U.S. civil population shifted in physical characteristics between the 1959-1962 HES and 1971-1974 HANES time period. U.S. adult males are overall taller (1/2" to Iй) and heavier by 6 lbs (3 lbs female) than in the previous de- cade. By 1974, the mean weight of men (18-74 years) was 172 lbs, and, for women, 142 lbs, with a mean height of 69" for men and 63-1/2" for women.</page><page sequence="4">950 R. G. SNYDER STUDIES OF TRUCK AND BUS DRIVERS - There have been two major attempts to obtain anthro- pometric data defining the truck and bus driver populations, and a third survey of age, height, and weight. Although there have been other studies of truck drivers for 19 measures (48), they are not representative of the U.S. truck driver. In 1951, McFarland et al. (1958) took 32 measurements of 375 professional drivers. These consisted of 103 bus bri vers and 104 truck drivers from New England and New York, 65 Texas truck drivers, and 103 champion truck drivers representing all states. The drivers averaged 36.8 years of age and 10 years of pro- fessional driving (10). The major findings by these investigators were that truck and bus drivers are a distinct occupational group physically. Texas drivers were taller and thinner than those of New Eng- land (in 1955 the average American working man was 5ł8-l/2 " tall and weighed 163 lbs). Truck- ers were reported to have no single physique, but were found to be in general stockier and "more masculine." They were bigger in weight, breadths, and girths, but not in stature or body lengths (10). However, there are some serious limitations in attempting to apply these 1951 data to the current truck and bus driver population. The data are now 30 years old. While they may be representative of drivers of a generation ago, they probably do not represent the current driver population. Regional differences may be less, because of today's mobility and changes in both the interstate hi'ghway system and trans- portation routings. This study measured only males, and is probably not representative raci- ly or ethnically, or for today's female driver population. The most recent anthropometric survey of truck and bus drivers was conducted for the Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety (7). Fifteen static measurements were taken, plus nine "nor- mal driving ? postures" and three reach envelopes on 277 drivers (227 truck and 50 bus). The sample included 267 (96%) males, 10 (4^) females, with an age range of 22-64 years and a mean of 40.2 years. The drivers represented 62.5% pri- vate truck fleets and 54.7% in long-haul oper- ations. Steering wheel forces and sleep (berth) envelopes were also measured. Data were collect- ed in eight cities, using a two-man team in a 22-foot van. The drivers were 92% (25) white, 7% (19) black, with one being oriental and 1% (3) of other races. The driving experience was 0-44 years, with a mean of 16-1/2 years. Results showed that drivers were larger than in the 1951 survey in all measures except arm reach and seat breadth, were heavier, and sit higher. This study represents the most recent truck driver anthropometric data. However, several limitations should be considered. A possible bias may have occurred both in selection of the drivers (those who volunteered) and in sites (not representative of big haulers). It is dif- ficult to make accurate comparisons with other populations, since some were taken with clothes on (except shirt). The full range of some mea- sures (height, weight) were not presented be- yond the 5-95th percentiles. Some of the mea- sures cannot be precisely duplicated and are subject to error since they were photographically measured, not taken by instruments (subject in "relaxed driving position," for example). The anthropometric data for females is based pri- marily on only nine subjects, although ten were reportedly measured. And, finally, several of the most critical measures for the seated work- space design were not taken, such as abdominal depth (steering wheel to abdomen). It was also unfortunate that the BMCS study did not consider any of the measurements needed to support the subsequent NPRM issued in 1978 relative to "step, handhold, and deck requirements of commercial motor vehicles" (29) (see critique in Ref. 30). In 1980, a survey to obtain a larger sample of current age, height, and weight data on truck drivers was conducted by Yellow Freight System, Inc., in cooperation with the SAE Occupant Di- mensional Parameters Subcommittee. These data were obtained by review of the 1978 and 1979 physical examinations for 5,730 on-road and 4,226 city truck drivers. Preliminary combined analysis indicates that these drivers average 41.7 years of age, 70.5" average height, and 190 lbs mean weight. The Yellow Freight driver averages 1.3 inches taller, 18 lbs heavier, and 2.3 years older than the U.S. male driver (31). At the extremes, these drivers range from an individual 5 foot, 200 lbs to one 7 foot, 260 lbs. However, the reliability of these data are subject to a number of biases. Measure- ments were taken by many different individuals without using a standardized technique. Height was apparently rounded off to the nearest whole number, eliminating fractions. Weight on some individuals was taken with shoes on and some with shoes off; similarly, some individuals were clothed and some not. Female drivers were not separated, and only 22 drivers were under age 25. POPULATION COMPARISONS - As previously noted, comparison of the 1959-1962 HES and 1971- 1974 HANES I anthropometric data showed that the U.S. general population has gotten taller (males being 1/2" to 1" taller) and heavier (males av- eraging 6 lbs, females 3 lbs). The weight and stature of the truck driver populations of 1951 and 1977 are compared in Tables П1 and IV for both the U.S. general popu- lation of 1960-62 and 1971-73, and with other selected occupational populations. Significant differences between many of these groups for these measures are apparent. Comparison of sitting heights is presented in Table V. Data are not yet available from the U.S. general population HANES study to compare sitting height or other measurements, other than weight and height. Similarly, larger body sizes are reflected in comparison of the 1951 Harvard (8-11) and 1977 BMCS (7) studies of truck and bus drivers.</page><page sequence="5">DRIVER BODY SIZE 951 TABLE IV STATURES OF RFPRESENTATIVE U.S. POPULATIONS Stature Inches 57 59 61 63 65 67 69 71 73 75 77 Age (cm) (145) (150) (155) (160) (165) (170) (175) (180) (185) (190) (195) Range Mean No. MEN 650Í1) 700 73 8 Truck Drivers (BMCS) '77 - ' '■»- 22-G4 40.2 276 ^ 64.6 68 4 72.5 ^ Truck Drivers (1951) (55, *58 мшянмммннммнмммшмав 35 s 360 llłupp ,,rt 64 4 69.0 73.6 llłupp HANES ,,rt 79 18-74 5260 urç HES ,со 62 6?6 60 * 728 urç HES ,со 62 ШШШШШШШШЯЁЁШШШШ-ШЁШ-ШЁЁШ 18-79 3091 6.6-6 7Q0 740 LAW 74 20-60 2989 64.5 1 687 ^ 73 »SA '66 64.5 1 687 ^ 73 6682 659 690 7З.Э USAF 07 ' 2420 WOMEN 61.2 64.1 698 Truck Drivers (BMCS) '77 ввм^яннааанн^мн|авв^наа^нжмн^авян q 59.5 63.7 67.8 HANES 79 Mtn'„ei мм............ i 844 59.0 62.9 671 HES 62.9 671 ' 358, 62.5 655 68.8 Stewardesses '71 423 60.1 64.2 68 5 U.S. Army Women *77 1331 58.9 60.0 638 67.8 69.5 Atr Force Women '68 ' ' ' - ^ 18-4A 21.0 1905 '''vertical lines show 5th, 50th, 95th, percentiles for each population.

Note that female truck drivers (1977 study) are 15 lbs lighter and .4 inches taller at the 95th percentile level than the general U.S. female population (HANES 1979), although this may be due to sampling size. Any future study should examine closely the important question of whether anthropometric design data of current (and future) truck and bus driver populations can validly be taken from current (and predicted from future body size trends) U.S. general population data, or whether this population represents an occupational group having distinct physical characteristics. Table VI provides a preliminary comparison of measure- ments taken applicable to the truck driver popu- lation, and the necessity to obtain an adequate and representative sample. It i's important that functional measures also be taken of the driver's physical dimen- sions, which take into account the interrelation- ship of spatial requirements while performing driving tasks. Spatial envelopes could assist the truck cab designer in better accommodation, and take into consideration the incidence of individual body proportion variations that occur (long trunk, short legs or arms, etc.). Accom- modation curves and bivariate ellipses have been explored as an alternative to percentiles in the experimental statistical design for subjects re- presenting the U.S. population in work by the University of Michigan for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to design and fab- ricate a new family of crash test seated anthro- pomorphic dummy forms (52). FUTURE POPULATION VARIABLES As indicated in the preceding brief review of anthropometric data currently available re- lative to the U.S. truck driver population, there are a number of limitations ranging from applicability of the data to lack of needed di- mensional measures. A new anthropometric study is badly needed to provide up-to-date measures of the present generation of truckers and obtain measures re- quired by the designer not previously taken. In addition, with the influx of female drivers, de- sign consideration must be given to the physical dimensions and capabilities of this group as well, which may impose new minimum requirements for some interior cab measures. SAMPLING PROBLEMS - An initial problem con- fronting any new survey will be to describe and determine just what the heavy on-the-road truck- ing population consists of. Although the Ameri- can Trucking Association estimates that there are between 1.5 and 1.75 million drivers in this category (1), some estimates are below 1 million and others are as high as 2.5 million. Driver organizations such as the International Brother- hood of Teamsters and the manufacturers alike have not been able to provide more precise es- timates. One of the reasons why this is diffi- cult is because truck drivers may have multiple registrations in a number of different states. This has been the subject of a recent National Transportation Safety Board report (32), and other studies (33-34). • It will thus be diffi- cult to conduct a valid study utilizing a small sample population technique because of the un- known profile variables describing the total trucker population (.geographic, age, sex, race, etc.). Unless such information can be made available, a national probability survey must be designed for national sampling. A major consideration in the sample strat- egy is driver accessibility, particularly when socio-cultural factors could affect sampling</page><page sequence="7">DRIVER BODY SIZE 953 bias. For example, relying solely on sampling truck drivers at rest stations along their route could introduce significant bias into the sample. Truck drivers are paid predominantly in one of two ways: (a) by the loaded mile, and (b) by the hour. If interviews and measurements were conducted solely at truck stops, the vast major- ity of voluntary respondees would be those driv- ers paid by the hour, since those drivers paid by the loaded mile would not wish to take the time required. In addition to the introduction of a sampling bias, this obviously would need to be approved by the employing motor carrier and might be unacceptable if the driver were de- layed beyond his or her usual period of time. One promising sampling strategy would be based on truck registrations at terminals. That is, general geographic terminal locations could be chosen and a statistically defined size of the total sample to be surveyed allocated to each location. Then, specific drivers associat- ed with the vehicle registration could be chosen. This selection could be done: (a) by sampling all drivers at a terminal on a voluntary parti- cipation basis; (b) by sampling on a probabil- ity basis drivers from varying fleet sizes; (c) by selecting all drivers from fleet sizes; or (d) by suitable combinations of the above. Thus, in effect, the sampling could be conducted at terminals through the drivers' employers. SEX - At present there is no reliable esti- mate of how many female over-the-road truck drivers there are, and future cab design must take the increasing numbers of women drivers (with concomitant implications for minimizing dimensional requirements for some seated oper- ations) into consideration. Female employment data by state and metropol i tan area computed in 1978 showed 20,140 female truck drivers in the U.S.; however, it is unknown how many of these drive heavy trucks (12). Overall by state, wo- men comprise from .15% (Iowa) to 2.07% (Idaho) of the truck driver population. The 9,956 Yellow Freight drivers included only 22 female (.2%) drivers for 1978 and 1979 (31). To date, mea- surements on only 10 female subjects are avail- able from the 1977 BMCS study (7). Currently there are not good estimates of how many female over-road truck drivers there are, and there- fore it is unknown what proportion any sample would represent. Comparison between female and male body size dimensions are illustrated by Figs. 1-2.

As shown in Table VIII for U.S. male civilians (HANES study 1971- 74) the mean weight increases for the 50th%ile male, for example, from 161 lbs for the 18-24 year old group to 172 lbs at age 25-34 years, 176 lbs ages 35-44 years, declining to 175 lbs in 45-54 year age group, and 170 lbs at 55-65 years. It may be expected that truck drivers, being in a seated position much of the time, may be more inclined toward having larger waists and hip areas. Some indication of this was shown in the 1951 and 1977 truck driver studies. Thus it is important that future anthropometric studies ensure that the truck driver population is ac- curately represented by age distribution. RACE - There are no accurate breakdowns of U.S. racial mixture due primarily to the differ- ing definitions used and conflicts between social, legal, and biological terms. The U.S. Public Health Service uses a figure of about 11% Negroes TABLE ix Weight of Black and White U.S. Males Aged 18-74 years 19Л-74 from HANES Study (82, p. 24) Percentile 5 th 50th 9Sth Men weignt in Pounds Age Black White Black White Black White 18-24 123 125 159 162 227 222 25-34 124 1 34 1 62 1 73 2 35 232 35-44 130 133 180 177 255 224 45-54 1 35 1 29 1 62 1 76 230 225 55-65 119 125 163 171 249 220 65-74 121 123 156 165 218 210 18-74 125 129 163 171 239 224 in the U.S. population. However, there is no definition of how this is determined. Another source of racial information is the U.S. Census, which in 1970 listed 81.1% white truck drivers, 13.2% negro drivers, and 4.2 "Spanish" drivers. However, heavy truck drivers were not considered separately, and a problem with racial definition still exists. In general the U.S. population has been considered to consist of approximately 88% whites, 11% blacks, and less than 1% mongo- loid or "other." However, this can be an im- portant factor in anthropometric measures. Any sample of U.S. truck drivers must represent the racial mixture, so that the sample will be re- presentative. Differences between white and black males and females for both weight and height are shown in the 1971-74 HANES Study of the U.S. popula- tion. While 90% of white women fall between 104- 199 lbs, and between 129-224 lbs for white males, 90% of black women fall between 104-228 lbs and 125-239 lbs for black males. White women average 142 lbs, black women 156 lbs. The population distribution by race is not known for truck driv- ers, but as indicated by U.S. population data, is an important factor. Table IX shows differ- ences in weight between U.S. white and black males at different ages. CAB INTERIOR DIMENSIONS In 1951 McFarland et al . (11) examined ten bus and 12 truck cabs and reported a number of deficiencies in the design of the driver's work- space. Large men were in some cases forced in- to cramped positions with inadequate clearance for operating controls and insufficient room for comfort. Smaller men were found to be required to stretch or twist the body abnormally in oper- ation of the vehicle; some were unable to reach controls, or were seated too low for proper vi- sion. One case was cited of a large driver who had to shift gears before he could operate the foot brake. More recent complaints noted by IBT drivers indicate that some problems still exist for some individuals. Additional problems of female truck drivers was also discussed at the 1980 SAE National Truck Meeting at Valley Forge. However, no information has apparently been compiled as to body size and particular cab configuration in such cases to determine whether such individuals are within the 95th percentile design limits for that dimension. The recent BMCS study (February 1980) of interior cab dimensions of heavy duty motor ve- hicles has provided further discussion of cab dimension design problems (6). The first con- clusion is "1. Interior cab dimensions of many heavy duty commercial motor vehicles (especially Class 8) are such that drivers of these vehicles experience discomfort and do not have sufficient room to properly operate all controls" (p.l). Another indication that there may be some variations in cab dimensions relative to that necessary to accommodate today's driver popu- lation is found in the report of Miller and Anderson (1978) to the IBT regarding human fac- tors considerations (14). The comparison (Table X) of recommended and actual truck cab dimen- sions prepared by Miller and Anderson show 9 of 10 models in current operation had less than McFarland 's 17.8" recommended distance from the lower edge of the steering wheel to seat back in rear-most position, or 26" distance from top of highest foot pedal to lower edge of steering wheel. Except for seat depth (where 9 of the 10 truck models compared met or exceeded the McFarland recommendations) similar dimensional deficiencies were noted.

Hemmings cab dimensions for European trucks are provided for comparisons only since they are not necessarily applicable to U.S. truck drivers. Updated recommendations for the 1981 range of female and male driver would probably increase these criteria. ^ 4- « со ТЭ pJ 4- O i- с ip- СП Ч- •*-&gt; Ф О т- CU о ГО о о си о to С7&gt; +-&gt; СП о J.

A manufac- turer often offers many different optional seats for just one model . While some exception to the dimensions listed on the Miller/Anderson table has been expessed (see footnote 5 Table X), it should al- so be noted that their comparison was with the truck driver dimensions found nearly 30 years ago. Using data* reported in the more recent 1977 BMCS study for truck drivers, for example, would show an even greater disparity between some dimensions in cabs and that necessary to accommodate current drivers at the 95th percen- tile male design level. The horizontal distance from the lower edge of the steering wheel to seat back ("belly room") was recommended in the 1951 study to be 15" hori- zontal distance to the mid-adjustment point (gi- ven 6" fore-aft traverse and 8° angle for seat back) or 17.8" with seat back in rearmost posi- tion. But data from the BMCS study indicate that the 95th percentile male truck driver of 1977 weighs 22 pounds more than his 1951 counter- part (7). If so, "belly depth" may also be pro- portionately greater and a new criteria of 18- 3/4" may now be required to accommodate the 95th percentile male driver. Further, considering female drivers, some minimums should now be considered at the 5th percentile female level if the total driving population is to be designed for. Seat adjust- ment vertically must provide not only adequate visibility for the shorter driver, but also ad- just low enough for the legs to comfortably reach the accelerator pedal. Table XI shows how current truck driver physical measures, based upon the 1977 BMCS study and HANES population data could change the 30-year-old McFarland recommendations. The 1981 recommendations summarized in Table XI have been previously analyzed in detail (50_). Also, these estimates of selected cab dimensions required to accommodate 90% of the truck driver population have been projected from the avail- able truck driver and U.S. population data and represent best estimates based upon physical user dimensions. A new study of driver physical di- mensions could provide a better data basis. At present there is no standardized test procedure or methodology for measuring pertinent cab size parameters. There is no single body of data available relative to guidelines or standards on truck cab dimensions. Rather there are bits and pieces which may or may not be applicable. During the past year a Task Force of the SAE Occupant Dimensional Parameters Subcommittee has been reviewing SAE Recommended Practices relative to application to truck cab dimensions. One of the recommendations of the 1980 Bu- reau of Motor Carrier Safety study of Interior Cab Dimensions (6) was that a determination be made as to what minimum interior dimensions should be used in cab design. It was concluded that specific dimensions should not be specified in federal regulations at this time because of the difficulty in making certain measurements. Cab dimensions are highly interrelated, and a change in one dimension (for example, seat height), will affect a number of other dimensions (such as driver leg angle, panel to seat back, steer- ing wheel rim to belly, and brake, clutch, throttle relationships, seat back to steering wheel, etc.). The latter dimension, seat back to steering wheel, depends upon (1) the diameter of the steering wheel , (.2) type of seat, (3) seat fore-aft horizontal adjustment, and (4) seat vertical adjustment. It is difficult to com- pare specific dimensions between cabs. One potential solution explored by a manu- facturer in the I960 's was the concept of a uni- site seat in which the seat could be adjusted by tilting around its forward pivot to a position such that any occupant will have the same visual line of sight. Combined with adjustable foot controls and adjustable steering wheel theoreti- cally such a cab would provide an optimum fit for any occupant within the design range (51). CONCLUSION Anthropometric data presently applicable to heavy truck drivers are limited. The Harvard studies of the 1 950 1 s are outdated, and their data probably do not represent physical dimen- sions of current drivers. A more recent BMCS (1977) study did not include some measures nec- essary to cab interior design, and it is unknown how accurately it represents the truck driver population. However, evidence clearly indicates that the heavy truck driver of 1981 is physically larger than the U.S. general population. With increasing numbers of female drivers, more at- tention must be given to minimum dimensions as well as increasing other dimensions to accom- modate 90% of today's drivers. A new anthropo- metric survey is necessary to provide the de- signer with accommodation curves. It must con- sider factors of sex, age, and race, and be ba- sed upon a valid sampling strategy to represent a trucker population possessing basic character- istics (size, no. of females, racial makeup, and age breakdown) that are presently i 11 -defined or unknown. To date there is no single body of data available relative to guidelines or standards on truck cab dimensions. Some estimates of current cab interior dimension requirements have been provided by projecting available data for pre- sent design minimums.</page><page sequence="12">958 R. G. SNYDER REFERENCES 1.
