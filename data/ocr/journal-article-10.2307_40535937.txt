<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AND IDEAS By ROGER SHATTUCK Reflections on the Spiritual in Art Last winter the Los Angeles County Museum of Art opened a large exhibit entitled The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting 1898-1985. Maurice Tuchman organized the exhibit and edited the magnificent catalogue (Abbeville, 1986). Like many complacent Easterners I missed the show, which moved from Los Angeles to the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, then to the Haags Gemeentemuseum, The Hague. The New York art magazines sent their first-line critics and gave it good space. Now that it's too late, I'm kicking myself for not having made the pilgrimage. The seventeen essays and extensive illustrations in the catalogue convince me of the significance of the event. It synthesized and illustrated over ten years of scholarship on the origins of the abstract impulse in modern painting, scholarship that had remained dispersed until Tuchman assembled its results in a new museum and in print for all to see. The double event reemphasizes the fact that painters continue to have insistent, extrapictorial, and sometimes very weird notions about what they are or should be painting. Tuchman's revisionist thesis, stated in the Introduction and elaborated in the other essays, deserves consideration. Since the thirties, critics like Alfred J. Barr, Meyer Schapiro, Clement Greenberg, and Harold Rosenberg have persuaded us to view art since Impressionism in essentially formalist terms. This preoccupation with design and style, line and color, surface and boundaries overlooks certain aspects of art history. The chief issue linking artists in the 1890s, from Paul</page><page sequence="2">6 ROGER SHATTUCK Gauguin to Sf rusier...was their conviction that Impression- ism lacked ideas and that their role as artists was to reinvigorate painting with meaning.... Four leading abstract painters - Wassily Kandinsky, Frantisek Kupka, Piet Mondrian, and Kazimir Malevich - moved toward ab- straction through their involvement with spiritual issues and beliefs. Tuchman and his colleagues insist that these painters and others like Arp and Duchamp developed primarily outside the formal experi- ments of Cubism (a movement deeply influenced by poetic specula- tions about the fourth dimension) and devoted themselves intensely to content. Partly because he wrote about his convictions in The Spiritual in Art (1912), a slim book widely translated and read, Kandinsky had the most powerful influence. For years art historians like Will Grohman and Werner Hofmann ignored Kandinsky's statements. "The artist must have something to say, for his task is not the mastery of form, but the suitability of that form to its content" (The Spiritual in Art). "Now I knew for certain that the object harmed my paintings.... What should replace the missing object?... I felt more and more clearly that it is not a question in art of the 'formal' but of an inner wish (= content) which imperatively determines the formal.. ..Thus will mankind be enabled to experience first the spiritual in material objects and later the spiritual in abstract forms" ("Reminiscences," 1913). For Kandinsky "content" came to mean Theosophy, the ideas of Madame Blavatsky and Rudolph Steiner, and the thought forms of Annie Besant and Charles W. Leadbetter. After a few years his paintings sank in a pool of symbols inspired by these spiritual systems. Intelligent critics like W.H. Gombrich and Robert Hughes have long been alert to these crosscurrents; Dore Ashton pointed out their presence among American artists in her well-informed The New York School (1972). Tuchman and company do not permit us to nod patiently and return to our old ways of thinking. The catalogue of The Spiritual in Art makes exciting and tendentious reading. It even contains a measured refutation of its own thesis. Along with several other artists Richard Diebenkorn received a prospectus of the exhibition and was asked to respond. His reply appears as a long footnote to Tuchman's Introduction. You do refer to the "formal experiments" of Cézanne, Post-</page><page sequence="3">Art and Ideas 7 Impressionists, and the Cubists as culminating in abstrac- tion and you called it the traditional viewpoint. But the overall impression I get from your alternative interpretation is that you give it all to the mystics and spiritualists in regard to the genesis and development of abstract and non-objective painting. For me, the prospectus shapes up as a kind of refutation of the traditional viewpoint rather than a much needed illumination of the total picture. My exception is based on the fact that abstract painting was a. formal invention. Also that major turns or changes in art historical styles are not come by easily, overnight, or by individual artists (another "traditional viewpoint" tells us that Kandinsky invented non-objective painting). What seems to get lost in your prospectus is that the formalist line from CCzanne through Cubism arrived at a point on the threshold of total abstraction wherein it was implicit, and for the most astute artists a clear option. That both Picasso and Matisse at different points in their careers rejected the crucial step is irrelevant. They had come the distance in a difficult and prolonged process of abstracting and simpli- fying, as did several of their "formalist" peers. From my view, in about 1910 advanced artists were presented, so to speak, with a vehicle, which in the case of the mystics and spiritualists was made to order for their expressive needs. This eloquent and intelligent statement calls for two responses. I would say that the exhibition and catalogue, going far beyond the prospectus, do furnish what Diebenkorn asks for: an illumination of the role of the spiritual in the formation of abstract art. Furthermore Picasso's and Matisse's rejection of total abstraction is far from irrelevant. It means that they did not choose to replace figurative images of the visible world with another content entirely, namely the spiritual. Nor did they choose the art of pure forms and colors and lines without context - a theoretical possibility with few instances, not Mondrian, not even Islamic art. "Nature abhors a vacuum," as I have explained elsewhere at some length (see "Meyer Schapiro's Master Classes" in The Innocent Eye, Washington Square, 1986). For a full-scale review of The Spiritual in Art catalogue I would have many more observations and criticisms. One omission makes</page><page sequence="4">8 ROGER SHATTUCK the book curiously lopsided. No contributor refers to English art criticism from Pater and Ruskin through Roger Fry and Clive Bell. Bell's Art appeared in 1914, two years after Kandinsky's book. "'Significant form' is the one quality common to all works of visual art." That sentence from Bell's opening pages, worked out particu- larly on Cézanne, has associated Bell with the formalist approach attacked by Tuchman. But Bell's emphasis falls increasingly on the word "significant." The third chapter confronts the need, in a formal art presumably approaching the abstract, for a subject to canalize aesthetic emotion. Bell finds such a subject not in verisimilitude but in the thing seen in itself; it will allow us to "become aware of its essential reality, of the God in everything, of the universal in the particular, of the all-pervading rhythm." Bell's "metaphysical hypothesis" affirms that significant form in art can convey these perceptions. By the last chapter he has surpassed Kandinsky in proclaiming the spiritual dimensions of art. "Art is a religion.... It is an expression of and a means to states of mind as holy as any men are capable of experiencing." The added fact that both writers reproduce the Byzantine S. Vitale mosaic of the Empress Theodosa to illustrate their use of "form" suggests that Bell may have seen Kandinsky's book before he finished his own. Two of the most widely read volumes on art during the years of teeming activity just before World War I insist on a content neither primarily figurative nor primarily formal, but ultimately spiritual. The Spiritual in Art, the catalogue of the 1987 exhibition, redresses an imbalance in our thinking about abstract art. It also provides Diebenkorn's dissenting view and a sly report that by 1920 the new art had already been mocked as "cosmic wallpaper." The poets studied in this volume all love the physical world to such a degree that they sense within it some transcendent meaning, some hovering aura of belief. Roughly speaking, the quest each undertakes is to discover that hidden meaning by revealing the "hieroglyphic" nature of the physical universe. (Peter Stitt, The World's Hieroglyphic Beauty: Five American Poets, 1985) Stitt's perceptive and well written book came to my attention while I was reading Tuchman's catalogue. Stitt demonstrates the survival of spiritual motifs and attitudes in Richard Wilbur, William</page><page sequence="5">Art and Ideas 9 Stafford, Louis Simpson, James Wright, and Robert Penn Warren. Between them Tuchman and Stitt deal with what are essentially the religious beliefs of dozens of modern artists. Many of the Europeans belonged to a cult or study group. Almost none on either continent continued in maturity to participate actively in an organized religion or church. Tuchman and his fellow art historians probe back to Plato and Plotinus, Cornelius Agrippa and Jakob Böhme, Eliphas Levi and Madame Blavatsky as sources for the 19th-century revival of the spiritual. Stitt's book has no historical or philosophical dimensions at all except for brief comments on allusions in poems quoted. His five poets seem to float on an ocean without depths, without a sense of the past. Where Stitt is content to study the poems and interview the living poets in order to find the hieroglyphic nature of their imagination, Tuchman identifies and illustrates "five underlying impulses" out of the occult traditions that recur in the "spiritual- abstract nexus": cosmic imagery, vibration, synesthesia, duality, and sacred geometry. Are the religious lives of modern poets as limited and as naive as Stitt paints them? Is it primarily painters who are plunged into a thick solution of spiritual motifs and imagery reaching back to hermetic traditions? Is there any way of connecting these two group portraits? I believe so. In the last chapter of The Great Chain of Being (1936) A.O. Lovejoy describes how the German idealist philosopher Friedrich W. J. Schelling, pushed hard by his antagonist Jacobi, put forward a thesis on an emergent, evolutionary deity closely linked with this world and nature. This "new mood and temper of religious feeling" occurred forty years before Darwin. "The Platonistic school of the universe was turned upside down," writes Lovejoy, "and. ..the originally complete and immutable Chain of Being had been turned into a Becoming." Schelling's role in the early 19th century reaches far beyond philosophical notions about Godhead. When Madame de Staël came back from her travels and wrote De l'Allemagne (1810; seized and banned by Napoleon) she lifted a striking passage out of Schelling without acknowledgment. The universe is made on the model of the human soul. ..the analogy of each part of the universe to the whole is such that</page><page sequence="6">10 ROGER SHATTUCK the same idea is reflected constantly from whole to part and part to whole. These sentences represent one form in which a doctrine as old as Plato's Timaeus reenters the bloodstream of Western culture at a moment when poetry was making claims to occupy the function of religion. Spinoza's pantheism is not far away. In such a universal analogy the spiritual starts a whole new career. Less than twenty years after Madame de Staël's borrowing, the half-cracked poet of political utopias, Charles Fourier, quoted the identical passage (fully acknowledged) in The New Industrial and Societary Universe (1829). A few pages later Fourier sets himself up as the inventor of the analogical method. Hugo, Balzac, and Zola constructed elaborate literary edifices on these and similar foundations of universal correspondence. Meanwhile in America another poet was raising his voice. It is not words only that are emblematic; it is things which are emblematic;... It is easily seen that there is nothing lucky or capricious about these analogies, but that they are constant and pervade nature.... Because of this radical correspondence between visible things and human thoughts, savages, who have only what is necessary, converse in figures. (1836) A man is a bundle of relations, a knot of roots, whose flower and fruit is the world. ...I will now go behind the general statements to explore the reason of this correspondency. (1841) Thus Emerson states the message in Nature and "History." Lecturing a few years later on Swedenborg, a rare hybrid of scientist and mystic, Emerson quoted from Treatise Concerning Heaven and Hell, a book he owned. "There is a Correspondence of all things in Heaven with all things in Man.... The Universe of heaven... resembles a man." Rather than comment I shall go on quoting. Shortly before his suicide in 1855, Gerard de Nerval composed this credo. How have I been able to exist for so long outside nature and</page><page sequence="7">Art and Ideas 1 1 without identifying with her? Everything lives, everything acts, everything corresponds with everything else; magnetic beams emanating from me or from others traverse unob- structed the infinite chain of created beings. They form a transparent network which covers the world and whose fine threads communicate directly with the planets and the stars. At this moment captive on earth, I can converse with the celestial choir, which participates in my joy and my grief. (Aurelia, 1855) Two years later Baudelaire, who surely knew the Schelling passage along with a whole set of occultist and esoteric writings, published the famous sonnet-manifesto, "Correspondences." A prose version appears in his article on Victor Hugo where he speaks of "the mystery of life" and "the morality of things." Those who are not poets cannot understand these things. Fourier turned up one day to reveal to us, much too pompously, the mysteries of analogy... Swedenborg, who possessed a much greater soul, had already taught us that the heavens are a vast man; that everything, form, move- ment, number, color, perfume, in the spiritual as in the natural domain, is significant, reciprocal, converse, corres- ponding.... Now what is a poet in the largest sense but a translator, a decoder? There is no end to the citations on the doctrine and the sense of analogy; it has vigorously survived the decline of organized religion. In the opening pages on Symbolism in Axel's Castle (1931) Edmund Wilson derives from the Romantic poets and Whitehead a firm personal declaration. Human feelings and inanimate objects are interdependent and developing together in some fashion of which our traditional notions of laws, of cause and effect, of dualities of mind and matter or of body and soul, can give us no true idea. I believe that this sweeping and all-pervasive tradition of analogy and</page><page sequence="8">12 ROGER SHATTUCK correspondence unites and feeds the multiple strands of the spiritual discussed in Tuchman's catalogue and what Stitt calls the hiero- glyphic vision of five American poets.1 Few of us can resist the wish to put the pieces of the world together, and we give lasting recognition to some, like Jesus, Muhammad, and Gandhi, who convinced many others that they could make sense of it all. There is nothing original about saying that the widely held belief among artists and writers in a universal unity represents a survival of religion in secularized form. Few of them would reject any connection at all to spiritual experience. In an interview in Stitt's book R. P. Warren says what most artists, let alone ordinary citizens, would agree with: "I am a man of religious temperament in the modern world who hasn't got any religion." But in fact he does. He practices religion in a diluted form which we accept as artistic and literary, a poetic faith without worship or ethics.2 It is difficult to say how long analogy alone will sustain and satisfy us. Two broad questions now strike me as unavoidable. Does this vast sense of unity in the universe divide up into kinds or categories that will help us grasp its variety? And where do we find significant criticism of or an opposition to the belief in the connectedness of all things? I discern three intermingling currents within the broad flow of mental activities I have been referring to as the spiritual in art. The first and most obvious expresses in painting and literature a sense of universal analogy and correspondence between physical, mental, and spiritual domains in an all-embracing, gently pulsating organic unity. In modern times this mystic belief was given new impetus by Böhme in the 17th century, powerfully relayed in the work of Schelling and Coleridge, and by Swedenborg in the 18th century, 1 A special form of analogical commentary within the Christian tradition had developed out of Aquinas and Dante, now referred to as "figurism" or "typology. " 2 It is worth remarking that Mme. de Staël, the enthusiast in all things, had not given up belief in a Creator and in an ethics based on analogy. The passage quoted earlier continues: "They are no purposeless play of the imagination, these continual metaphors that compare our sentiments to exterior phenomena: sadness with a cloud-covered sky.. ..It amounts to a single thought process of the Creator translating itself into two different languages. Almost all axioms of physics correspond to moral maxims."</page><page sequence="9">Art and Ideas ' 3 whose ideas reached England through Blake and Coleridge and many religious thinkers. The relatedness of all things manifests itself in several strong visual images: a sacred geometry of lines traversing and linking the entire cosmos; the spiritual edifice or temple of nature; and the crystal. In portraiture and painting of the human figure the scientific principle of physiognomy, the great buzz word of the 19th century, justified the discovery of the essence of things in their appearance. Such a presumed revelation of the interior by the exterior, the principle lodged at the heart of realism in the arts, runs counter to much of human experience. It soon found its ironic sequel in caricature. The new genre had scientific, aesthetic, and political roles to play in the development of both modern art and the modern novel. Of course, the sense of unity of all things has deep scriptural sources and inspired such sturdy minds as Jonathan Edwards'. Many of his meditations sound like sustained celebrations of the principle of universal correspondence. Again it is apparent and allowed that there is a great and remarkable analogy in God's works. This is a wonderful resemblance in the effects which God produces, and consent- aneity in His manner of working in one thing and another throughout all nature.... why is it not reasonable to suppose that He makes the whole as a shadow of the spiritual world. (Images or Shadows of Divine Things) Stitt's book on American poets would benefit greatly from some consideration of at least this native background and other historical sources. The second strand that forms the spiritual tradition displays a different sense of timing. Instead of feeling sure of a permanent overreaching hierarchy in the universe, a person may experience the world as a quotidian round verging constantly on a meaningless flux. At rare intervals one may stumble upon a fleeting surge of release and revelation. We talk almost glibly of epiphanies in Joyce and Proust and Woolf. In his 1954 Romanes Lecture, "Moments of Vision," Kenneth Clark speaks of how Millet's remarkable images of hushed communication are heightened by van Gogh's "burning-glass per- ception." Clark goes on to trace the sentiment of wonder into a sense of possession close to "a morsel of collective experience." Joyce's sentence in Stephen Hero describing an epiphany after Aquinas</page><page sequence="10">14 ROGER SHATTUCK ("...its soul, its whatness leaps to us from the vestment of its appearance.") sounds like a definition of physiognomy. Carried to full intensity and conviction, the moment of vision may produce a spectral effect. I am thinking of the aura one finds in painters like Bonnard, Vuillard, Munch, and Kupka. In a long passage on "mythical thinking" in Language and Myth (1946) Cassirer makes a startling claim about these moments of "sheer immediacy." The spark jumps somehow across, the tension finds release, as the subjective excitement becomes objectified, and con- fronts the mind as a god or a daemon. When Cassirer borrows from Usener the term "momentary god" for such an epiphany, he has more company than he thinks. In criticizing the propensities of modern poetry to the pathetic fallacy Ruskin in Modern Painters praises Homer, who "had some feeling about the sea.. .that he calls a god." In Proust's novel Marcel cannot decipher the signals that seem to be coming from three trees near Hudimesnil and misses a potential privileged moment. Mme. de Villeparisis in the carriage with Marcel says he looks as if he had "failed to recognize a God." Acknowledging Hegel, Barthes paints a portrait of "the ancient Greek [who] perceived in the vegetal or cosmic order a tremendous shudder of meaning, to which he gave the name of a god: Pan" (The Structuralist Activity). In these four cases "god" is the ultimate analogy for analogy. The best way into the third strand of correspondence is through William James's reflections in 1909, the year before his death, about his much maligned research on psychic and spiritualist phenomena. Confessing to bafflement because of incomplete and often fraudulent evidence, he pauses for a highly personal statement. Out of my experience one fixed conclusion dogmatically emerges, that we with our lives are like islands in the sea, or like trees in the forest.... The trees also commingle their roots in the darkness underground, and the islands also hang together through the ocean's bottom. Just so there is a continuum of cosmic consciousness, against which our individuality builds but accidental fences, and into which our several minds plunge as into a mother-sea. (Memories and Studies VIII)</page><page sequence="11">Art and Ideas 1 5 As an analogy for the yearnings of human consciousness the ocean is probably as old as the beholding mind itself. Most graduate students today seem to think that Freud invented the "oceanic feeling" (with help from Romain Rolland) in Civilization and Its Discontents. R.M. Bucke covered all this ground in a widely read book called Cosmic Consciousness (1901). Among contemporary authors Iones- co has given in Present Past Past Present (197 1) one of the most lyric and convincing accounts of a moment of boundlessness and euphoria. These three categories of the spiritual in art - analogy, moments of vision, the oceanic feeling - may represent an order of increasing profundity and intensity. They are also tentative and far from exhaustive. Furthermore, though in most cases I do not question the sincerity of the individual artists or writers who had the experiences, I am aware of many physiological and psychological conditions (from stress and heart flutter to drugs and self-hypnosis) that might induce them. The two great mental poles that divide our thinking, faith and doubt, make room very reluctantly for the interloper that T. H. Huxley named only in 1869: agnosticism. Let's look briefly at the opposition to the correspondence principle to see if the lines are clearer in that camp. But there's hardly a camp. If one looks up the subject heading "analogy" in a library one soon finds that most references are devoted to theology and mathematical analysis. So far as I can ascertain the range of critical positions in philosophy from skepticism to nihilism expend little effort on attacking analogy as a mode of thought. Many of the greatest figures of the Enlightenment who, we might expect, would reject such loose methods, attached themselves to devices that functioned as correspondences. Newton believed that space was God's sensorium. Locke had his white paper and his dark room. La Mettrie had his man-machine, Condillac his living statue. The first critical treatment of analogy is probably Kant's attack on Sweden- borg in his early work, Dreams of a Spiritseer (1766). Then Hume tenaciously scrutinized the notion of "necessary connexion" at the heart of causality, an exercise so corrosive of our whole grasp of reality and meaning that most organized thinking including science has simply skirted around Hume and gone on. Because he confined his complaints to the arts where violent feelings, he argued, can lead to a kind of "falseness," Ruskin's</page><page sequence="12">16 ROGER SHATTUCK coinage "pathetic fallacy" has lasted. The phrase implies censure. Though an admirer of Keats, Ruskin had grave reservations about lines like these describing a breaking wave. Down whose green back the short-lived foam, all hoar Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence. (Endymion) "Wayward indolence" attributed to a fleck of foam on tons of salt water strikes Ruskin as "a perfect example of the modern manner." Homer would have proceeded quite differently, as we have seen. Ruskin's testiness about attributing human qualities to inanimate objects anticipates a whole nihilistic strain in modernism and post- modernism that turns instead to the fragment, the junk ward, discontinuity, and isolation. In an essay called "Nature, Humanism, Tragedy" (1958), Alain Robbe-Grillet calmly carries Ruskin all the way. He takes to task the whole humanist-Christian tradition in its affirmation of a "solidarity" between human beings and the world they live in. In literature the experience of this solidarity appears above all as the search, constituted as a system, for analogies. A metaphor, for example, is never an innocent figure. To say that time is "capricious" or the mountain "majestic," to speak of the "heart" of the forest, of a "pitiless" sun or of a village "snuggled into the hollow of the valley "...[all this] is deplorable because it leads to a notion of hidden unity. We must banish this anthropomorphic principle and face up to "absence of meaning," the emptiness that surrounds us. Robbe- Grillet's unblinking analysis provides the essential background for the commonplaces of twenty years ago - the absurd, nausea, play, chance. They have not abandoned us. But any vigilant observer knows that the works of Kafka and Beckett, of Arp and Barnett Newman, and of Robbe-Grillet himself, are studded with analogies and symbols that shunt us back to the world of human experience, including the spiritual. We have come full circle to Kandinsky's dilemma when he prepared to eliminate objects from his painting, a dilemma raised now to the next power: without analogies and correspondences and meanings, what can a work of art or literature be about?</page></plain_text>
