<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ALAMITO CULTURE OF NORTHWESTERN ARGENTINA VICTOR A. N(UNEZ REGUEIRO ABSTRACT As a result of five field seasons in the Campo del Pucara, Prov. of Catamarca, the Alamito culture, dated in the fourth century A.D., is one of the best known ar- chaeological cultures of the Valliserrana subarea of north- western Argentina. The 50 sites excavated show only slight variation in subsistence (essentially agricultural), technology, ceremonial structures, burial pattern, settle- ment pattern, and inferred social organization. Close affiliations are evident with the Cienaga, Condorhuasi, and possibly Tafi cultures of Argentina; further afield, similarities can be observed with the Megalithic culture of Bolivia, Chiripa and Titicaca Basin complexes, and more remotely with Peru. THE Campo del Pucara (Dept. of Andalgala, Prov. de Catamarca), located about 100 km. north of the town of Catamarca, is a broad valley with a gently rolling surface deeply cut by the beds of rivers that remain dry or reduced in flow for most of the year. It is bounded on the north and west by the Sierra de Aconquija, on the east by the Sierra de Santa Ana, and on the south by the Ambato chain. In the culture area classification proposed by Gonzalez (1963a; Gonzalez and Perez 1966), it constitutes part of the Valliserrana subarea. Although the Campo del Pucara was vis- ited twice toward the end of the last century (Tschudi 1861; Lange 1892), the Alumbrera archaeological zone was discovered only in 1951 by Gonzalez (1952, 1956a). In 1957 and 1958 excavations were undertaken by the Instituto de Antropologia, Universidad Nacional del Litoral, under the direction of Gonzalez. Aside from newspaper articles, only three preliminary publi- cations have appeared (Gonzalez 1957; Gon- zalez and Niunez Regueiro 1960a; Petruzzi 1961). In 1959, Nunez Regueiro conducted limited ex- cavations alone, and in 1964 he led an expedi- tion on behalf of the Instituto de Antropologia, Universidad Nacional de C6rdoba. A second expedition in 1966 was cosponsored by the Asociacion Argentina de Antropologia-C6rdoba. The culture revealed by these investigations has been called Alamito. This article describes its characteristics as evidenced by the aforemen- tioned investigations. The archaeological zones in the northern part of the Campo del Pucara have been referred to as Alamito or El Alamito (after a small village about 8 km. northwest of the sites) and Alum- brera, or as Las Estancias, a term that embraces the other two. Fifty archaeological sites have been examined in this region. Of these, 24 (Sites A-O to X-O) are at 1700 m. elevation, 15 (Sites A-1 to N-1) are at 1800 m., and 11 (Sites A-2 to J-2) are at 1900 m. (Fig. 1). Each site is a dis- crete planned unit (Fig. 2), and units are in close proximity (Fig. 3). Additional sites occur at the 2000-m. contour or at even higher elevations toward the north, while others are located in the valley to the southwest of the 1700-m. terrace. Still others are found to the southeast near Agua de las Palomas (Fig. 1). Description of Site. The settlement pattern of the Alamito culture is well defined and uni- form. Each site takes an approximately circular form. A refuse mound, which may reach 3.10 m. in elevation, is located on the west side, in recog- nition of the fact that the prevailing wind is from the east. East of this midden are two platforms with their principal axis in a north-south direc- tion; they are separated by a passageway. Adja- cent to each platform is an open shelter, and beyond this a series of mounds corresponding to dwellings were arranged to form a circle (Fig. 2). The central patio has an unconsolidated or poorly consolidated floor, which did not increase in elevation as the dwellings rose on successive superimposed floors, so that, with the passage of time, it occupied an increasingly lower level relative to the houses. When slides threatened, one to four stone retaining walls were con- structed on the slopes of the mounds and also around the refuse middens, especially on the eastern side where sloughing threatened to im- pinge on the platforms. Discontinuous retaining walls likewise sur- round most of the site, and there are passage- ways between the habitations for access to the exterior. In a few cases, broad earth staircases were constructed against a low stone retaining wall, as at Site G-0, which had three staircases descending from the south platform toward the exterior of the site. In some sites a small loess mound of unknown function is located near the platforms on the west side of the patio (Fig. 2). In one case it appears to have been faced with stone. Dwellings can be divided into two general types: shelters and true habitations. The shelters, located at each side of the platforms, were roofed 133</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY FIG. 1.

At site D-1, where they have been most thoroughly studied, the roofs burned and collapsed over pottery and other objects. The southern shelter had an ele- vated circular floor edged with a well-built stone wall provided with two earth staircases. The roof was constructed with logs 10 cm. in diame- ter that rested on posts and supported smaller poles arranged perpendicularly. The latter were covered with two layers of canes, upon which was placed a covering of grass or straw and clay. Two types of habitations can be distinguished. Type A is rectangular, 2.5 to 5.5 m. long, and is entered by a narrow (50 cm.) passage at one end (Fig. 4). The earth walls are faced, from the floor to a height of about 50 cm., with a 2- to 3-cm.-thick layer of beaten clay; above this height the earth is loose. Along the side walls are columns of superimposed stones laid with their flattest face toward the interior. Their separation varies between 70 and 140 cm., but the majority are from 80 to 100 cm. apart. Their lower part is concealed behind the clay facing. Although the sides are strengthened with clay, no mortar was used between the stones. The house floor is perfectly level and is covered with beaten clay, so that it is very hard; up to four superimposed floors have been encountered. Habitation 1 at Site D-1 differs in appearing to lack an entry passage, in having stone col- umns on all four sides, and in possessing two 134 [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970</page><page sequence="3">ALAMITO CULTURE FIG. 2. Plan of a typical site of the Alamito culture. post foundations in the center in the form of stone slabs 50 cm. below the floor. Except in this case, habitations appear to have had a sloping roof of a construction like that of the shelters; to provide slope the columns supporting the beams must have been taller at one side than at the other. Type B houses differ from Type A in form rather than construction. Walls, columns, roof, and floor are like those of Type A. Entry pas- NAT IONAL UTE 62 ROU 6 KjM.137 TO CATAMARCA N Fa ? i , I o.

The side walls tend to converge toward the rear, and corers are rounded (Fig. 4). Max- imum width varies between 3 and 5 m.; length varies from 6 to 15 m., but it is usually under 10 m. The rear of the structure may be square or curved. One example had a clay partition separating the rear third from the rest of the interior. Habitation 3 or Site D-1 contained openings between the columns that may have served for storage, since maize grains, some car- bonized, were encountered in one. Habitation 4 had benches more than a meter wide along the two sides not provided with columns (Fig. 4). The two platforms, which were present in all 50 of the sites examined, are low, rectangular structures. Original height is estimated at up to 2.5 m. A 4-m.-wide passage runs between them, communicating between the patio and the refuse NOiEZ REGUmRO ] 135</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY midden. The walls are constructed of stones, which are sometimes trimmed to produce an even exterior surface. The interior surfaces are irregular. Various types of evidence indicate a ceremonial function for the platforms. A mono- lithic figure (Fig. 5b) and stone heads have been found associated, and human skeletal remains, in a condition suggesting the possibility of hu- man sacrifice, were encountered at sites B-0 and G-0. One skeleton from a shelter in Site B-0 lacked the portion of the body above the second lumbar vertebra. Burials. Twenty-five primary burials were en- countered in oval pits, usually beneath the floors of habitations or shelters. Of the 18 cases in which the position could be identified, all but one were flexed. Five were lying on the right side, four were on the left side, and seven were on the back. One was head downward, with the femurs extended and the lower legs folded back; one (a child) was extended. Two child burials were found next to one of the platforms. All of the skulls exhibited deformation of the tabular erecta type. Associated artifacts were rare, and they consisted principally of bone, shell, or stone beads, bone combs, or copper rings, all of which probably were worn at time of burial. Three in- dividuals from site D-1 were provided with offer- ings; in one case these consisted of two Cienaga jars and a stone mortar, and in the other two of Cienaga vessels only. These may reflect accul- turation by the Cienaga culture, with which the Alamito culture had prolonged and close con- tact, since D-1 appears to be a relatively late Alamito site. Subsistence. Maize growing is attested by the presence of kernels of Zea mays, var. micro- sperma (Parodi 1966: 18), while grains of Pro- sopis nigra imply the gathering of wild plants. Unifacial and bifacial manos and metates are very abundant, while mortars and pestles are slightly less common. Traces of quadrangular or rectangular features, which may represent fields, have been observed near the Condorhuasi and Ojo de Agua rivers. All the refuse middens contain abundant llama bones, some of which have been split to extract the marrow. It is not known whether the llama was domesticated. Bones of Ctenomys (a small rodent) and Chaetophractus (an arma- dillo) also occur. Artifacts. Ceramic analysis has not yet been completed, but some diagnostic Alamito pottery types can be mentioned.

Lines and Alumbrera Red Monochrome are characteristic of the oldest phase. Both are poorly smoothed and tempered with medium sand. Alumbrera Red Monochrome has a red wash over the entire surface, while Alumbrera Parallel Lines has irregularly spaced vertical parallel red bands about 5 mm. wide. Incised designs also occur. Condorhuasi sherds and a lesser number of Cienaga types are associated. Toward the end of the sequence, Alumbrera Parallel Lines disappears and Condorhuasi types become very rare, while Cienaga types increase in frequency. Ceramic artifacts include rare stylized anthro- pomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, whistles, tubular pipes, spindle whorls, and disks (which are generally interpreted as gaming pieces). Tubes between 10 and 15 cm. in diameter have been found on the floors of shelters and houses, suggesting that they may have served as chimney flues. The whistle fragments are frequent in the refuse middens, and they have a very well- defined form. Two perforations are provided for suspension, and three for sound. Two of the 136 [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970 : p ,. C? . 11^!-</page><page sequence="5">ALAMITO CULTURE FIG. 6. Pottery whistles. latter often occur in cylindrical projections (Fig. 6). Stone working is well developed. A number of artifacts are shared with Condorhuasi (Gon- za'lez 1956b), such as footed metates, polished ovoid bowls with a handle in the form of a human or animal head, sculptured mortars, and obsidian atlatl hooks. Other objects have even wider distribution in northwestern Argentina; these include well-polished bowls, plain mortars, manos, pestles, pendants, malachite and tur- quoise beads; wedge-shaped, completely grooved, or three-quarter grooved axes; small mortars with multiple cavities, mortars ornamented with sculpture or engraved lines, and simple hammer- stones. A hammerstone with a polished groove, another bearing a face, and two abraders were also found. Other types of objects appear to be unique to the Alamito culture. A monolithic stone figure 98 cm. tall (Fig. 5b) is the only alter-ego representation in stone found to date in north- western Argentina. Unpolished stylized stone heads (Fig. 5c-d) and highly polished "suppli- cating figures" (ciguenfales, Fig. 5a) are found in the vicinity of the platforms, sometimes in the debris of the collapsed walls. Another unusual object is a small pestle with two stylized heads (Fig. 5e), a motif repeated on another Alamito piece. The only weapons recognized so far in the Alamito culture are well-polished, symmetrical egg-shaped stones, 2.5 to 3.3 cm. in diameter and 4.2 to 6.4 cm. long. Although none has been found with cord attached, the damage on some skulls suggests that they were wielded at the end of a rope, in warfare. Depicted on one of the whistles is a person with a shield in the left hand, an ax in the right hand, and a cap on the head. Bone objects found in the refuse middens or with burials include combs with teeth about 7.5 cm. long, pendants, beads (principally circular), punches or perforators, projectile points (one well polished and with a row of barbs), and instruments probably used in weaving. Beads of shell are oval or circular and up to 2.7 cm. in diameter. Metal objects are very rare and always of copper; they include two small thin (ca. 2mm.) T-shaped axes, rings produced by bending a rec- tangular strip, fragments of tweezers with circu- lar pincers, and two small rods, one of which may have been a needle. Social organization. Contrary to the situation in other early period cultures of northwestern Argentina, where social differentiation is im- plied by the number of offerings with burials (Gonzalez 1955, 1961), Alamito sites provide little indication of status differences. Although the possibility that perishable items such as food or objects of wood, cloth, or basketry might have been placed with the dead cannot be discounted, the small dimensions of the graves suggest that these were not numerous, if present. While specialized craftsmen may have produced the stone sculptures, the quality of the pottery im- plies household manufacture. Certain tasks must have required the labor of the entire community. ard perhaps from other communities, although this would not have been necessary. Works probably requiring col- lective effort include construction of platforms, shelters, and retaining walls, especially around the refuse midden. Preparation of fields, if this involved clearing stones, and house construction may also have involved more than one family. Each site could have been self sufficient and occupied by an extended family. Each nuclear family probably occupied a habitation of Type B (and possibly also of Type A), while the shelters could have been used for communal activities and for religious ceremonies involving the adja- cent platforms. Chronology. Four radiocarbon dates are avail- able for the Alamito culture (Gonzalez 1959, 1960, 1962): A.D. 329-60 (Y-558); A.D. 399? 100 (L-476A); A.D. 304?48 (P-344); and A.D. 300?100 (T-220). These dates, representing three different sites and four laboratories, agree very closely. Three are from the 1700-m. con- MAU REGUEIRO ] 137</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY tour, and one (P-344) is from the 1800-m. con- tour. Based on cultural differences, the Alamito culture can be divided into two phases in the Alumbrera zone. Phase I is characterized by the presence of Alumbrera Parallel Lines and of Condorhuasi elements, while Phase II lacks Alumbrera Parallel Lines, has a predominance of Cienaga elements, and exhibits acculturation particularly in burial practices. RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER CULTURES The relationship between Alamito and other complexes was reviewed in a previous work (Gonzalez and Nunez Regueiro 1960a). Gon- zalez (1963a, 1963b) subsequently provided additional observations. These can now be sup- plemented and reinforced. As has already been noted, Alamito exhibits strong connections with Cienaga and Condor- huasi, although their intensities differed through time. Condorhuasi influence is evident not only in pottery types found in habitations and refuse middens, but also in stone working. It can be postulated that the Alamito culture arrived at the Campo del Pucara with an advanced knowl- edge of stone working. If so, it would not be surprising if it adopted a number of Condor- huasi traits, and this process would explain ele- ments common to both cultures. In spite of trade or acculturation, however, Alamito types of burial, habitation, and ceremonial construc- tion have never been found in Condorhuasi sites. Relationships with Cienaga are expressed in ceramics and, near the end of Phase II, in bur- ials. Acculturation is postulated to account for the late Alamito practice of placing offerings in burials, particularly since the pottery vessels are of Cienaga pottery types. Similarities with Tafi (Gonzalez and Nunez Regueiro 1960b) include a village plan with habitations arranged around a patio, burial be- neath the floor, poorly made plain and red painted pottery, egg-shaped stones, and stone monuments (although Alamito examples are smaller and different in style from those of Tafi). Alamito platform and retaining wall con- struction is similar to that employed in Tafi habitations, but the latter are entirely of stone whereas Alamito ones are not. Tafi habitations do not have superimposed floors; on the con- trary, they are semisubterranean or true pit houses. Stone-faced platforms and shelters are also absent in Tafi. No resemblances can be cited between Ala- mito and Chilean complexes, with the possible exception of the mounds reported by Iribarren Charlin and Niemeyer (1957) in Huasco. Although it seems probable that the Mega- lithic culture or Mound culture of Bolivia de- fined by Ibarra Grasso (1956, 1960) includes more than one complex, there are a number of elements reminiscent of Alamito. Among them are: clay walls, superimposed floors, burials beneath floors, disks (used in games), "tubes" of pottery, stone heads, and red painted pottery. Bennett (1936: 413-46, 502-03) has described architectural features at Chiripa resembling Ala- mito construction. The site consisted of a quad- rangular patio (called a temple by Bennett) which was at a lower level than the habitations and was faced by a stone wall. The habitations were arranged around it, and, although only two were excavated and a third precisely lo- cated, Bennett postulates that there was a com- plete circle containing 14 habitations facing in- ward (Bennett 1936: 420). The habitations had walls of adobe brick or stone mixed with clay that were "finished with a thick yellow clay wash" (Bennett 1936: 423). The foundation was stone. The walls were double and contained bins for grain storage accessible through nitches. In House 2, remains of a thatched roof were encountered. Superimposed floors were also noted. Beneath the floor of House 2, Bennett (1936: 436) found 13 burials, of which "some are covered with cloth, three had strips of gold on the forehead, several had bone, shell, and copper beads, and one had a small bone labret." Aside from these objects of personal adornment, no grave offerings appeared. The bodies were extended or flexed, without consistent orienta- tion, and they occupied'cists or pits frequently lined with stones. All skulls were deformed. These traits are all reminiscent of Alamito. The major part of Chiripa pottery is undec- orated. Yellow-on-red painting, with designs of "oblique bands and triangles commonly ar- ranged in step pattern" (Bennett 1936: 441) is the most typical decoration. This motif appears on one of the Condorhuasi white-on-red vessels from Alamito, although the shape is different. Finally, the similarity should be mentioned be- tween a feline modeled on a tube (possibly a pipe) found at the entrance of House 2 and the decoration on one of the whistles from Alamito 138 [ VOL. 35, No. 2, 1970</page><page sequence="7">ALAMITO CULTURE (Fig. 6b). Also, both Chiripa and Alamito (as well as the Megalithic culture) have tubular pottery pipes. In Peru, the construction of platforms and earth walls dates back to an early period. At Chavin de Huantar, Bennett (1944: 76-7, Fig. 28g) excavated a habitation of uncertain date, which bears similarities to Alamito houses. The stone and clay wall was covered inside and out- side with a 1-cm. thick layer of plaster. Along one side was a bench (Bennett 1936, Fig. 26) similar to that in Habitation 4 at site D-1 (Fig. 4). The stone heads associated with Alamito platforms are vaguely reminiscent of the stone heads of Chavln (Tello 1960: 253-99), in spite of their wide geographical and chronological separation. This brief review suggests that the principal affiliations of Alamito are with late Formative cultures of the highlands of Peru and Bolivia, and particularly with the area of dispersion of the Megalithic culture. Unfortunately, the term "Megalithic," like its synonym "Mound Cul- ture," is misleading and consequently it causes confusion. The work of Ryden (1952, 1961) justifies designating at last a portion of the complex as Chullpa-Pampa. Although I have been unable to consult the publication by Wal- ter (1966), a review by Menzel (1967) indicates that similarities to Alamito are even closer than has been evident in earlier publications. The passage of time and the exigencies of adaptation of a different environmental situa- tion in northwestern Argentina led to the crys- tallization of a distinctive culture, known as Alamito.
