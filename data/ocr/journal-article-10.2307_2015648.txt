<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE MEANING OF A PROPOSITION IN an article entitled "The Sacrifice of Barbara" (The Personalist, Oct., 1931) Mr. F. C. S. Schiller carries on his "mission" of fighting Formal Logic in connection with the two recent summaries of modern logic by Mr. Eaton and Miss Stebbing. But this time one can not help noticing behind the shield of sarcasms a change in the tone of Mr. Schiller's criticism: he is evidently much impressed by these two books. He admits that both Miss Stebbing and Mr. Eaton "have written good books," which present "a more perfectly formal form of Formal Logic," though he should rather brand them as deceitful sophistications, since he maintains that they are based on the same unjustified foundation as Aristotelean logic. Does it mean that Mr. Schiller is ready to make concessions or even is close to "conversion" ? I would not be surprised if it comes to that, because it is easily seen from his article that only misunderstandings on his part estrange him from modern logic. The purpose of this note is to straighten the matter in the hope of facilitating Mr. Schiller's con- version. I shall consider, however, only the main point of his criticism. Mr. Schiller observes correctly that modern logic is based on the concept of proposition, but he tries to undermine this basis by point- ing out that the meaning of a proposition is different in different uses and contexts, and consequently propositions are ambiguous and unreliable for building up the foundation of logic. Thus to say that a proposition is true is ambiguous, because "it may be true in one sense and use, and false in others." The answer to this criticism is that the meaning of a proposition is not a distinct entity from the proposition itself. The meaning of a proposition is the proposition. Hence the same proposition can not have different meanings in different contexts and uses, though, of course, many different propositions may be associated with the same verbal expression (sentence) on different occasions. The sup- position that a proposition could change its meaning betrays a most astounding anthropomorphism: a proposition being inanimate is not subject to growth or willful modifications. I am sure Mr. Schiller really does not believe that propositions can change by themselves. He probably means that people change their minds and often, with-</page><page sequence="2">716 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY out noticing it, replace one proposition by another; especially when these propositions are connected with the same sentence, or when they differ but slightly from one another. Thus it is very likely that he confuses proposition with sentence, which accounts for his accusa- tion that formal logic is verbal. But it may be that Mr. Schiller merely wants to express his be- lief that in actual discourse people never talk about the same proposition, i.e., each person associates with the same sentence a dif- ferent meaning (proposition). On this score logic would be criti- cized as inapplicable to practice. But certainly in a soliloquy one can consistently use the same sentence with the same meaning. And when several persons are engaged in a discussion the purely verbal misunderstandings are usually removed. When there is a dispute as to the logical meaning of a sentence, the practical way for an agreement is the use of a convention to the effect that the logical meaning is the minimum meaning (i.e., the least amount of connotation) of all meanings which are associated with the given sentence. Perhaps it is often difficult to determine the minimum meaning. Let us say it will sometimes remain an ideal. Nevertheless this ideal is logically important in that the at- tempt to realize it increases the precision of thinking. The science of geometry likewise starts with ideal elements. Yet it is indispen- sable in the construction of buildings. A. USHENKO. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.</page></plain_text>
