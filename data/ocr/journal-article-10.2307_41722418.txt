The association was noted long ago, but a selective analysis will show that both the narrative and the ritual reflect the model of annual solar motion expressed in terms of a suspended reference, a mythical metaphor, a lin- ear narrative defined both by the very nature of language and the celestial phenome- non it is describing. The analysis of various Greek calendars supports the notion of the solstices as the most important defining moments in the annual solar motion, and their connection with Apollo reflects precisely this fact. Keywords Apollo, Helios, solstice, calendar, Ursa Major According to Walter Burkert, a myth can be defined as "telling a tale with suspended reference, structured by some basically human action pattern" (Burkert 1979:57). Thus, there exist two main dimensions of myth: its narrative structure as "a syntagmatic chain of motifemes ," and a reference to a phenomenon of common (objective) reality thus "artic- ulated, expressed and communicated" (Burkert 1988:1 1).1 The myth of Apollo s northern journey in a chariot drawn by water birds, his arrival Cf.

Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 in the far north where he sojourns with his sacred people, followed by a turn about a mountain turning-post and the return to his point of departure, indeed forms such a basically human pattern. We could compare this concept with the nature of deities in Mesopotamian omen protases, as defined in a recent publication: "... the expressions ... are not statements about gods that substitute for statements about celestial phenomena, based on some putative interchangeable nature of the gods and the phenomena. The metaphorical expressions are better inter- preted as referring to the phenomena in terms of the gods" (Rochberg 2004: 175). If we would apply this postulate to this Greek concept, then the "Hyperborean Apollo" would represent a metaphorical expression of a phenomenon - the annual movement of the sun, with an emphasis on the solstices - in terms of the gods, that is, in mythological terms. But why apply this indirect terminology? Why not a direct reference to solar movements? Because originally, no doubt, the use of mythological expression was not a matter of pref- erence but of the absence of alternatives. The very perception of astronomical phenomena appears to have been configurational rather than positional And the form of expression best suited to such configurational perception is, of course, the narrative form, a tale ("myth" in Greek). In a purely oral, memory-based cul- ture, there would in any case exist no real alternative to the narrative format. (Reiche 1980:186) Reiches reasoning is confined to celestial phenomena, but a similar explanation could be applied to myths in general: "And still the tale often is the first and fundamental verbalization of complex reality, the primary way to speak about many-sided problems, just as telling a tale was seen to be quite an elementary way of communication. Language is linear, and linear narrative is thus a way prescribed by language to map reality" (Burkert 1979:23). Burkert continues with an elaboration of his definition of myth, the one we have mentioned in the first sentence of this paper: "The phenomena of collective importance which are ver- balized by applying traditional tales are to be found . . . [among other things, in] . . . the hopes and fears connected with the course of nature, the seasons ... or even the organization of nature and the universe . . ." provide a causation of actual phenomena in the present," creating "the adaptation of elaborate situational models."</page><page sequence="3">T. Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 5 1 1 (Burkert 1979:23). In "the age of myth" (Burkerts expression), "adap- tation of traditional tales is the only or the main method of general speculation and communication, in order to verbalize phenomena, to give them coherence and sense" (Burkert 1979:24; cf. Burkert 1985:8: "mythology is at first the sole explicit form of intellectual activity and the sole mode of coming to terms with reality"). In the same vein, according to Havelock (1963:165, cf. 41-42, 135; 1978:43, 46, 220), in non-literate societies the oral tradition conceals "within the narra- tive" the collective knowledge of a group (including "technical" knowl- edge, cf. 1963:27, 29, 43, 48, 64, 80-84, 91, 94, 100, 123, 132 n. 21, 198, 234, 291-292; 1978:63-64, 335-336), which, in order to be pre- served, had to be memorizable (1963:166-167, 180, cf. 42-43). Only a narrative of a series of actions (actions and events involving persons) conforms to this prerequisite (1963:167, 171, 173, 218, 234, 236, cf. 85 n. 18, 1978:42-43, 92, 106, 114-115, 122, 183, 220-221, 332). Although he is critical towards most of Havelocks theses, Halverson recognizes a similar role, in terms of narrativized preservation of tradi- tion, for Icelandic sagas (Halverson 1992:159). Havelock emphasizes calendar and "the star map governing navigation" among the technical directives transmitted in the narrative (1978:23). This narrative is, nat- urally, identical to myth, which Havelock understands as a term refer- ring to form rather than content and designating both story and statement (1978:46-47, cf. 2, 92, 336-337). Moreover, natural phe- nomena (among which Havelock enumerates "seasons and weather," 1963:170) also had to be described as series of actions performed by agents (1963:168-169, 171, cf. 180; 1978:50), which explains the presence of gods in their descriptions (1963:170; 1978:50). What we may conclude from this short exposition of Havelocks thesis is that the format of narrative actions performed by personified agents - in other words, myth - was necessarily used in non-literate periods for express- ing the knowledge of meteorological and other phenomena. Returning to our comparison with Mesopotamian omen protases, we encounter in them the coexistence of (to us) contradictory "modes" of thought about phenomena, for example, ["mythological concept"] that which views the full moon as the moon god wearing a crown, as well as ["scientific, rational concept"] that which sees the full lunar disk on the horizon opposite the sun on the fourteenth day of</page><page sequence="4">512 T. Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 the lunar month. Interestingly, it seems that "natural" phenomena became objects of study not in spite of their being products of divine agency and will, but pre- cisely because they were physical signs of divine agency and will. (Rochberg 2004:40) Compare also Havelocks contrast of Homers narrative, i.e., mythical, description of a natural phenomenon (a flood) with an abstract, i.e., philosophical, account of the same event (Havelock 1963:264-265). If we would apply the definition of "principles of natural philosophy" - "rules devised by humans to be used in building models to represent specific aspects of the natural world" (Giere 1999:94) - to the mytho- logical concept of Apollos northern journey, then it would represent a model (not a physical one, of course) representing a specific phenome- non of objective reality.2 The model was built, naturally, with the help of mythical narrative, the only means available at that period. The model was applied to, or rather integrated into, contemporary Greek ritual, reflected in the liturgical calendars of various Greek states. Three of these - Athens, Delphi, and Delos - are analyzed in this paper. Athenian Hekatombaiôn It is certain that the Greeks observed the solstices at least as early as the second half of the fifth century b.c.e. According to I Ar. Av. 997 (Philoch. FGrHist 328F122) Metons f]À,ioTpÓ7tiov, some kind of sol- stice-marking device (Ael. VH 10.7 claimed he had erected stelae and marked on them i'Xiox&gt; xpoTiàç, cf. Lehoux 2007:96), was located on the Pnyx hill in Athens, from where both the summer and winter solstice sunrise could have been observed over the summit of the Lykabettos mountain3 and over the ridge of the Hymettos mountain, 2) A model does not have to correspond fully to a physical reality in every aspect, but certain models may represent more aspects of the real world or fit some of them more accurately: "models need only be similar to particular real-world systems in specified respects and to limited degrees of accuracy..." (Giere 1999:92-93). "../fit' is not simply a relationship between a model and the world. It requires a specification of which aspects of the world are important to represent and, for those aspects, how close a fit is desirable" (Giere 1999:93). 3) According to Thphr.

Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 5 1 3 respectively (Hannah 2009:5-9, 56). 4 But already Homers xpomi ripiovo {Od. 15.404) probably referred to the solstices (Vlastos 2005 [1975]:34 n. 21; cf. Thomson 1948:37 with n. 1; Kahn 1970:113 n. 50, 1979:109, 140, 313 n. 133; Schibli 1990:5; challenged by Dicks 1966:31, 1970:32-33), and Hesiod was certainly aware of the phe- nomenon {Op. 479, 564, 663; Dicks 1966:31, 1970:34-35, 37; Vlastos 2005 [1975]:34 n. 21). In line with this observation we can mention how Plato {Lg. 1 2.945e) associated the "common precincts of Helios and Apollo" with a festival related to the summer solstice. His actual words are xporccxç f|^ío'&gt; toc ç £K 0épo ')Ç eiç xei|icova, which is a curious wording for expressing the notion of a solstice; Plato is much simpler in 6.767c, where he uses a common expression, Gepivòcç ipomç. This is sometimes taken (e.g., in Burkert 1985:336) as evidence for a common notion in Platos times - that of the identity of Apollo with the sun. Whether this infer- ence is correct or not, Apollo, the sun, and the summer solstice are defi- nitely associated with each other in this passage. Platos discussion allowed Proclus {Theol. Plat. 6.12) to strongly argue for his belief in the Apollo-sun identity, based precisely on this passage. He especially emphasized Plato s description of a common precinct of the two deities (945e, cf. 946d), followed by a statement that three men should be consecrated to the God (945e) or Helios (946b) or, joined together once more, Apollo and Helios (946c). It indeed seems as if Plato considered them to be identical, or at least similar enough not to think it necessary to distinguish one from the other. There is not much more to say concerning Platos ideas on the question of Apollo being identical with the sun. Macrobius reported how he etymologically derived Apollos name from the hurling forth that he actually utilized the Lykabettos "to establish an alignment between it and where the sun rose on the horizon at the solstices" (1988:80), while Pannekoek believed that "Phaeinos determined the solstices [that is, the extreme rising-points of the sun] with respect to the Lycabettus The irregular profile of the mountain made it possible to find the day [of the] solstice by detecting small variations in the azimuth of the rising sun" (1961:107). 4) The observing of the summer solstice of 432 by Meton is further mentioned in the Milesian parapêgma , fr. 84.1-3, Lehoux 2005:137, 2007:90 n. 42, 479; D.S. 12.36.2; Ptol.

Apollos name, on the other hand, was derived by Plato from his various responsibilities; among different etymologies, the last one he explains seems to be of special concern for our study (Cra. 405cd). Plato, associating the movement of the heavenly bodies with musical harmony, suggested that a in Apollo's name denotes mov- ing together in heaven (rcóÀ*r|aiç) around the poles (rcótaruç), and at the same time a harmony in song; Apollo is the deity who directs both the celestial and musical harmony (Cra. 405cd). Although we cannot say for sure that Plato imagined the sun as the ruler of celestial harmony, his later followers certainly imagined just that; they are not to be blamed for this conclusion, because it is an obvious one to make. For example, Heraclitus (All. 12.3, 13.1) associated the Apollo-suns rays with the harmony of the spheres. Returning to Platos discussion of the proposed summer solstice fes- tival, it is worth noting that the Athenian New Year commenced on Hekatombaiôn 1 , on the first sighting of the New Moon after the sum- mer solstice (Samuel 1972:64; Bowen and Goldstein 1988:45; Triimpy 1997:1, 6, 14, 283; Hannah 2009:8, 36-37). 5 This festival, then, was supposed to take place during the month of Hekatombaiôn, following the summer solstice,6 more precisely, on the day preceding New Year s Day (Leg. 6.767c: erceiSav piMri véoç evuruxòç jiexà Gepivccç xpomç tco ércióvii |xr|vi yíyveaGai, Tawrjç xfjç ruiépaç xfj rcpóoOev). By introducing Helios (the sun) into a description that could function in a satisfactory manner without him (the commencement of a new year in a month sacred to Apollo), Plato intentionally added a "physical" foundation for his festival (the annual motion of the sun culminating in the northern solstice). This is the reason why both deities are to be approached, and 5) Cf. Parker 2005:194 on Lys. 26.6 (Skirophoriôn 30 as the last day of the year). 6) Compare Arist.

If Plato considered Apollo identical to the sun, why would he explicitly name both, since Apollo himself was already associated with - at least - the summer solstice? I suggest it is precisely the "solstitial" aspect of Apollo that Plato wished to emphasize, following a tradition stemming at least from the time of Alcaeus (Ale. 307c Lobel-Page ap. Himer. Or. 48.10-1 1). Another source, admittedly a late one, suggests an Apollo/summer solstice/sun association. The Byzantine Léxica Segueriana (Aé^eiç priTopucaí) claims that the Athenian month of Hekatombaion, first month of the Athenian year, received its name after Apollo-sun on account of its making a ijiyocv ôpójiov, which is most certainly an allu- sion to the summer solstice (i.247.1-6 Anecdota Graeca Bekker s.v. rEraTO|jßaia)v; see the identical accounts in EM 321.4-12 s.v. fEicaTO|Lißaicöv and Traxoijßauöv). Here we find an explicit identifica- tion of Apollo with the sun, which was a common notion in Byzantine times, following the Late Antique syncretistic tradition. We are further informed by Hesychius (e 1270 s.v.) that the Athenians knew of an Apollo 'EkcctÓ|j$ccioç, and he was also known in Thessaly (SEG xxxvi. 548.20) and on Mykonos, where a sacrifice to Apollo 'EraxóiiPioç was offered on the 7th of Hekatombaion (Syll.5 1024.29- 31 = LSCG 96.29-31). 7 Moreover, the Lexicon claims that the first Athenians were begotten by Earth and Sun, and since Apollo is identi- cal to Helios, he may be called their ancestor (p. 291.33-292.3 s.v. Fláipioç Â7CÓMxdv A0r|vaíoiç 8ià ií écmv; compare I PI. Euthyd . p. ii.369 Bekker, Commentaria critica in Platonem). Compare Platos notion (Euthd. 302cd) of Apollo as the forefather of the Athenians on account of Ion (the notion is given as an alternative in the Lexicon , 292.3-6 and E Pl. Euthyd p. ii.369 Bekker, see also Arist. fr. 381 Rose ap. Harpocrat. s.v. ArcóÂAcov mípcpoç, I Ar. Av. 1527). It was only natural, it seems, to associate the month sacred to Apollo with the sun and the summer solstice, and the identification of Apollo with the sun was almost inevitable. Apollos association with solstices is highly 7) The Spartan Hyakinthia, devoted both to Hyakinthos and Apollo, were held in the Spartan month of Hekatombeus (Hsch. e 1272 s.v. eEKOCTO|iße')&lt;;), which probably corresponded to the Athenian Hekatombaion (Mikalson 1976:149-150 n. 29; Trümpy 1997:138-139).</page><page sequence="8">516 T. Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 significant and points not only to his origin as a solar deity but probably also to his foreign ancestry. But what about the "real" summer solstice festival in Athens, aside from Platos proposition? We know that the summer solstice fell on Skirophoriôn 13 in 432 b.c.e. (D.S. 12.36.2; Milesian parapêgma fr. 84.1-3, Lehoux 2005:137, 2007:90n42, 479; cf. Ptol. Syntax. 3.1, p. 205 Heiberg, 21st of Phamenoth; Samuel 1972:44-45; Neugebauer 1975:ii.588, 617, 622; Bowen and Goldstein 1988:64; Lehoux 2007:90-91; Hannah 2009:35-36), the last month of the Athenian year, between Thargeliôn and Hekatombaiôn (Samuel 1 972:57; Triimpy 1997:6, 9, 14).8 The preceding day, Skirophoriôn 12, was the day of the Skira festival (I Aristoph. EccL 18), when the priestess of Athena, together with the priests of Poseidon and Helios, went under a balda- chin (okux8eiov) from the Acropolis to Skiron (Harpocr., Suda a 623 s.v. ZKÍpov = FGrHist 328F14 [Philochorus], 366F3 [Lysimachides] , 484F1 [Praxion], Lycurgus Or. 6 fr. 19 Conomis). This festival was certainly related to the summer solstice (Burkert 2007 [1997]: 164-165), 9 and could be further associated with the summer solstice festival per- formed by Elagabalus in Rome, when he ran backwards in front of a solar chariot driven by the deity (Herod. 5.6.6-8; Burkert 2007 [1997]: 165). His running backwards certainly symbolized the start of the sun s backwards movement towards the south following the sum- mer solstice. The Skira baldachin (for which, see further Miller 1992:97-98) reminds us of the parasol belonging to a solar deity depicted in the Middle or Late Bronze Age Dupljaja chariot, regularly associated with a "Hyperborean Apollo" (Pare 1989:84; cf. Petrovič 1930; Garašanin 1951; Gimbutas 1965:342; Kossack 1954:11-12; Sprockhoff 1954:67, 73; Garašanin 1973:i.347-348, 1983:531-532; Letica 1973:60, 63-64; Vinski-Gasparini 1983:638; Bouzek 1985:53, 178, 234 n. 15; Vasič and Vasič 2003:158-160, 2004:182-183). 8) The festival of Dipolieia, celebrated on Skirophoriôn 14 (I Ar.

A solar deity that is usually called - not without some justification - the Hyperborean Apollo is mentioned by Alcaeus (born ca. 620 b.c.e.), but unfortunately only in a summary (307c Lobel-Page) preserved by the fourth-century rhetori- cian Himerius (Or. 48.10-11). Alcaeus, or rather Himerius, described Apollos swan-chariot in which the god flew after his birth to the land of the Hyperboreans, from which he returned to Delphi in the middle of the summer. The "middle of summer" (Gépouç xò |iéaov) probably refers to the summer solstice,10 which is rather curious in terms of solar motion, because the sun could only "go to the Hyperboreans," that is to the north, in the summer, and return southward in winter. If Hime- rius understood Alcaeus' verses correctly, Apollo was with the Hyper- boreans for a full year, so he must have flown to them on his swan-chariot on the preceding summer solstice, which makes more sense. On the other hand, he probably returned to Delphi on the win- ter solstice, when he must have left the farthest North. Apollo's return to Delphi, if we read Alcaeus' description as it stands, would have occurred in the month of Apellaios, the first month of the Delphian year, beginning with the summer solstice (KirchhofF 1865:134; Samuel 1972:74; Trümpy 1997:211-212), thus corresponding to the Attic 1()) Cf. Farnell 1907:104, Fontenrose 1974:460. Yet the term, whenever used, simply refers to the middle of the summer season, rather than the very solstice (Hdt. 8.12.1; Thuc. 5.57.1, 6.30.1; Theoph.

Delphian Bysios - Athenian Thargêlia On the other hand, Plutarch (De E 9.389BC) says Apollo is absent from Delphi during the three winter months, while the remaining three quarters of the year the god is in his sanctuary; thus, during winter, dithyrambs take the place of paeans in his worship. Consequently, according to Plutarch, Apollo is at Delphi both before and after the summer solstice, leaving only at "the beginning of winter" (àp%o|iévoD 5è xei^íòvoç); he is with the Hyperboreans, apparently, during the win- ter solstice. This tradition reflects the fact that the birthday of Apollo was celebrated in Delphi on the 7th of Bysios (cf. 1D6-7 Rhodes and Osborne), the first month of the spring in the Delphian year, which was formerly the single day of the year when oracles were pronounced (Plu. Quaest. Gr. 9.292EF with Callisthenes FGrHist 124F49 and Anaxandrides; Fontenrose 1974:383; Salt and Boutsikas 2005:565; Boutsikas 2007:99), suggesting an ancient tradition. Farnell (1907:258 n. c, 292) and Fontenrose (1974:380-381) believe that this celebration is identical with the Delphian theophania (Hdt. 1.51.2, cf. Poll. 1.34), while Salt and Boutsikas (2005:570; cf. Boutsikas 2007:103; Triimpy 1997:213) associate the return of Apollo from the Hyperboreans with the beginning of Bysios. There is no way in which we could balance these two traditions, since Bysios could never be referred to as the mid- dle of the summer, whether we take this to mean the summer solstice or not. But the epiphany of Apollo was probably celebrated in Athens on the Thargêlia13 (during the second spring month of the Athenian year), also his birthday (Plu. Quaest.

Dion. Hal. 1.63 placed the twenty-second or twenty-third of Thargêliôn sev- enteen days before the summer solstice, which would place the birth- day of Apollo (on the seventh of Thargêliôn, Farnell 1907:268) - and his epiphany? - thirty-one or thirty-two days before the solstice. Actu- ally, the whole month was sacred to Apollo (Hsch. 0 104 s.v. 0apyf|Xia; cf. Harp. s.v. 0apyr|X,ia 149.13 Dindorf), yet I Ar. PL 1054 and Eq. 729a (cf. Suda ei 184 s.v. Eipeoicovri) claim that the festival of Thargêlia was dedicated to Helios and Horae,14 which suggests the identity of Apollo and Helios, at least the Apollo associated with the Athenian summer solstice.15 Thus, the Athenian tradition indeed associated the epiphany of Apollo with summer, if not the summer solstice, while the Delphian tradition, as opposed to that recorded in Alcaeuss verses, associated it with spring. Is there anything more to say about Apollos absence and return to Delphi? In terms of the calendar, not much, unfortunately. But there is another stream of tradition, i.e., mythology. Thus, Hecataeus of Abdera (fourth century b.c.e., FGrHist 264F7),16 in a much-repeated and well- ,4) Cf. Porph. Abst. 2.7.1, from Theophrastus (Parker 2005:204), without actually mentioning the festival's name. 15) Cf.

Scholiasts often ascribed the Apollo-Helios identifi- cation to Aristophanes (e.g., X 409-41 lb, PL 8, Tz. Nu. 595a, PL [ree. 2] 8b, 39a, 359), which does not tell us much on Aristophanes' opinion, naturally. Apollo and Helios were certainly identified in the Boeotian Daphnephoria - a festival resembling the Delphian Stepteria, celebrated at the summer solstice according to Fontenrose 1974:460 (Farnell 1907:294 has early summer) - with its bronze sphere symbolizing the sun (Apollo) and the garlands symbolizing the 365 days of the year, but the source for this identification (Proclus) is late and known for his syncretistic tendencies (Proci, in Phot. Bibl. cod. 239, p. 321 bl 8-23 Bekker; cf. I Clem. Alex. Protrep. 10.10, 299.9-13 Stählin and Treu). The festival was associated with the seventh of Thargêliôn in Müller 1844:332-333. The summer solstice month in Apollonia (McCabe 15.2), Dyrrachion (McCabe 25.2-3), and Dodona {SGDI 1338.5), was named ÂtaoxpOTtíoç (Triimpy 1997:156 with n. 666, 158 with n. 678, 163); Triimpy 1997:163 claims that it corresponded to Athenian Thargêliôn. 16) His On the Hyperboreans , although mostly fantasy, might have included certain data from Pytheas' report (Roller 2006:66 with n. 85).</page><page sequence="12">520 T.

This must mean that Hecataeus associated Apollo with the sun, moreover, with his role in the solar year as a regulator of the calendar. In another place, Hecataeus called this island, which was left unnamed in the report of Diodorus, Helixoia, probably in associa- tion with the constellation of Ursa Major, Helikê {FGrHist 264Flla ap . St. Byz. s.v. 'EAiÇoioc; cf. Hdn. Gr. iii. 1.281 Lentz; Krappe 1947:223; cf. Macurdy 1920:140-141; Thomson 1948:403). Both Helikê and, consequently, Helixoia, derive their name from the verb è^íooco, "to turn round or about" (LSJ s.v.). Hecataeus FGrHist 264F1 lab (St. Byz. s.v. 'EÀíÇoioc [= 73B1 D-K] and Kapauß-orai) called the inhabitants of Helixoia the Hyperborean Karambykians, after the name of a river, Karambyka (cf. Hdn. Gr. iii. 1.281. 13-14 Lentz for the river Karam- byka associated with Helixoia); this name has to be connected to the Karambis promontory in Paphlagonia, situated opposite "Helikê the Bear," exposed to Boreas (A. R. 2.360-362 with 1 360-363ab, p. 157 Wendel; cf. Str. 2.5.22, 12.3.10). It is interesting to find in the mulApin (a collection of Mesopotamian astronomical texts from ca. 1000 b.c.e., Hunger and Pingree 1989:7, 10-12) that mulMAR.GÍD.DA (Ursa Major) lies across where the North wind (,mSI.SA) rises (II.i.68; Hunger and Pingree 1989:87). From Mesopotamia this concept migrated to India17 and Persia.18 Homer uses the word in the expression meaning "to turn [the chariot] round the doubling-post," Tep|xa0' è^íaaéjiev (77. 23.309), lépjia. . . èÀá^aç (77. 23.466), while E.

Interestingly, it has recently been argued, through an analysis of the origin of the word arktos , "the bear" (in the meaning of Ursus arctos, Ursa Major and Minor), that Proto Indo-European *Hñtkúo-s derives from the root *E2ret- (through *Efit-kùo -), meaning "roll, turn" (cf.

Thus, the very name of the constellation Ursa Major would be connected with the revolving of circumpolar stars around the north celestial pole - not only the stars of Ursa Major, but all the circumpolar stars - yet Heraclitus could not have been aware of it. Since Heraclitus described the Bear as "forming the limits of morning and evening", rioûç Kai èorcépriç xepjiaxa apKxoç (22B120 D-K ap . Str. 1.1.6), we can safely conclude that Helixoia meant to Hecataeus "the island of turning,"19 that is, "the island of the solstice," combining in its nature the association both with the constellation that marked the location where "paths of day and night meet" ( Od . 10.86), and with the Suns annual turning round the solstitial xép|ia (cf. Macurdy 1920:140-141). Concerning the connection of the constellation of Ursa Major with the limits of the annual solar movement, sometimes described in terms of "doubling a post," one could evoke several passages from the work of Festus Avienus. Thus, in Or. Mar. 649-650 he described what seems to be an allusion to the summer solstice: cum relaturus diem septentrionum accesserit confinia ("when he [Phoebus] brings back the day as he approaches the limits of the Bear"). In Descr. orb. terr. 761-763, GGM ii.184 we similarly read: hie cum plaustra poli tangit Phoebeius ignis , nocte sub illustri rota solis fomite flagrai continuo, clarumque diem nox aemula ducit ("there [at Thüle], when Phoebus fire touches Ursa Major, under shining night the Suns wheel burns with continuous flames, and the night, eager to equal it, leads the bright day"). In the latter passage Avienus associated the summer solstice s twenty-four-hour day at Thüle with the suns "encounter" with Ursa Major, which could only mean he had in mind the Arctic Circle determined by the stars in this constella- tion. Both passages - the one from the Descriptio directly - are derived from D.P. 582 ( GGM ii. 141), which reads: "there [at Thüle], when the sun advances towards the pole of the Ursae " This descrip- tion is imprecise to the point that it is impossible to draw any 19) xépiia (pl. xépiiaxa) has a double meaning: "turning post," "turning point" (which is the only meaning present in the Iliad), but also "boundary," "endpoint," terminus (Kahn 1979:51, 161; Purves 2010:56 with n. 88).</page><page sequence="14">522 T. Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 conclusion other than that the sun approaches the north. "The pole of the Ursae" is simply the North Pole (cf. Eust. D.P. 581, GGM ii. 330.8- 10), but the association of the phrase with Thüle as the island of the solstice probably led Avienus - who certainly knew his early Ionian astronomy - to connect it more explicitly with the Ursa-determined Arctic Circle.20 In the Pseudo-Aristotelian De inundatione Nili (fr. 248 Rose, p. 195.5-6 = FGrHist 646F1) we read that during the summer accedente sole ad ursam ("the sun approaches the Bear"), which probably only means that it approaches the North. When Diodorus, or rather his source, Timaeus, placed Britain exactly under the Bear (bn' ocuxriv rnv apKTov, FGrHist 566F164 ap. D.S. 5.21.6) he probably did not think of the/an Arctic Circle (compare his - or Posidonius' - placing of Gaul, or its northernmost part, under the Bears in FGrHist 87F1 16 ap. D.S. 5.25.2, 32.3), but his source, and this was certainly not Pytheas, might have had just that in mind. Nonnus spoke of the voogcc of the zodiac, identical with the tropical points (1.454, 3.35, 38.277-279, 284, 327; cf. 38.259, where the meaning is doubtful) and of the Bopeiáç vÚGoa beside which the Bears move (25.398, 38.406-407), which could be associated with the ')'|/rcevf|ç vügooc of 38.284-285. Thus again the Bear would define the northern limit of the sun s voyage. Heraclitus' oúpoç ociGpíoi) Aióç opposite the Bear is another limit of morning and evening - i.e., the southern. In P. Derv. IV. 8 Heraclitus claims that the sun does not exceed its "proper limits" (to')[ç opouç] - [o]po')Ç è[ott)To{)] or e[i|iap|iévo')ç]; in a corresponding passage Plutarch De. Exil. 1 1.604A = D-K 22B94 has the term jiéipoc,21 while in De Is. et Os. 48.370D he retains ôpouç), which is certainly an allusion to the solstices (Lebedev 1989:43; cf. Kirk 1962:285, Kahn 1979:109, 156, 160, 199); this would make the oúpoç ociGpíoi) Aióç opposite the Bear an allusion to the winter tropic (Kirk 1962:289; cf. Kahn 1979:109). Ptol.

Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 523 "regions of the Bear" "outside the solstice" (942a 1), which also suggests the association of the constellation with the annual solar movement. Alcaeus and Heraclitus were not the only authors who described Apollo s voyage to the north and his absence from Delphi (only implied in the latter). Cicero (N.D. 3.57) claimed that the "third Apollo," the son of Jupiter and Latona, according to tradition, "came to Delphi from the land of the Hyperboreans," which seems to represent a tradition similar to the one reported by Alcaeus. Claudian (De VI Cons. Hon. 26-27) reported how Apollo leaves Delphi for Hyperborea and (his) altars, only to return from the Riphaean (sic) on a chariot drawn by grif- fins (30-31), which supplanted the earlier swans.22 These are the only two testimonies describing the Delphi-Hyperborea route. Yet we know from other sources that Apollo visited this fabulous northern country. Thus Abaris, a mythical character, is supposed to have written a poem on the arrival of Apollo to the Hyperboreans (Suid. a 18 s.v. 'Äßapi&lt;;). A. R. 2.674-675 reported how Apollo traveled to Hyperborea starting off from Lycia, while Simmias of Rhodes (fr. 2 Powell ap . Ant. Lib. Met. 20) implied he visited the Hyperboreans starting off from Baby- lon. A. R. 4.61 1-617 further described Apollos sojourn in Hyperborea as a kind of an exile, not as a regular occurrence. Other sources speak of the presence or absence of Apollo at the oracle at Delphi. Thus Z Call. Ap . 1 discerns false from true oracles on account of the presence (é7ti8ri|iéco) and absence (àrco8r|}iécô) of deities; when discussing Del- phi, this can apply only to Apollo (cf. Pi. P. 4.5 , mentioning Apollo's presence - he is oi)K ot7róôiijLioç - during a prophecy and Z Pi.

Archaeological traces of Apollo s northern voyage are rather scanty. Kunze (1950:36, 74, 242; cf. Bridgman 2005:185 n. 42) recognizes Apollos return from Hyperborea on a shield strap from Olympia dated to the beginning of the sixth century b.c.e., where a bearded Apollo holding a cithara approaches Artemis holding a branch (a doe might be 22) They are said to be sacred to the sun in India and were represented as pulling its quadriga (Philostr.

This picture seems too general to allow such a precise determination, and I hesitate to include it among the representations of the Hyperborean Apollo. Apollos swan-chariot was not very popular in art, since he is never depicted using it. On the other hand, his Spartan associate seems to have used it often, although Philostr. Jun. Im. 14 is our sole source mentioning Hyakinthos riding in Apollo's swan-chariot. (He mentions the fact while describing a painting, but this detail does not seem to be represented on it.) There are occasional occurrences of the theme in Etruscan art from the end of the sixth century onwards.23 LIMC Hyak- inthos 35 = Apollon! Aplu 74 is a Kanne from Vulci, dated to the begin- ning of the fourth century b.c.e.; it depicts Apollon/Aplu holding a laurel branch, driving a horse-drawn biga, and Hyakinthos driving a swan-drawn biga. Hyakinthos 37-39 = Apollon/Aplu 76 are three Etrus- can carnelian scarabs depicting a human figure driving a swan-drawn biga , dated in the fourth and third centuries b.c.e. (No. 39 might show a trace of a quiver, which is highly conjectural, but it would associate him with Apollo, rather than Hyakinthos; no. 38 perhaps holds a spear, as does no. 40, another fourth/third-century scarab.) Hyakinthos, inti- mately related to Apollo and his cult, is syncretised with the latter in Nonn. D. 11.330 (Atióààxov TockívGioç) and Plb. 8.28.2 (ArcóMxov TockivGoç), while the notion of the Laconian Apollo Tsxpaxeip in Hsch. K 3853 s.v. KoupiSiov24 could have arisen from some double herm-rep- resentation, possibly of Apollo and Hyakinthos (Farnell 1907:127, 371 n. 45), although this theory is rather unsubstantiated. A very rare early silver coin of the Spartan colony of Taren tum depicts a naked youth in a Kniclauf position, holding a lyre in his left hand and a (hyacinth?) flower in his right; it is not unreasonable to suppose that this is a repre- sentation of Apollon Hyakinthios.25 These examples show that the 23) See LIMC 5.1 548-549 35, 37-40, 5.2 378 depicting Hyakinthos in a swan- chariot; also Sichtermann 1956:figs. 17-18 = Hyakinthos 35. 24) Cf. k 4558 s.v. icuvocKiaç; Sosib.

Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 525 persons of Apollo and Hyakinthos were sometimes interchangeable, and the notion of a swan-chariot must have developed out of an Apollo cult. Finally, returning to literary sources, we hear how Sappho (fr. 208 Lobel-Page) and Pindar (fr. 262b Bowra, cf. fr. 52c Snell = Pa. 3 in P. Oxy. 5.841 and Snell's discussion in his edition of Pindar, 1964:ii.20) have decked Apollo with golden hair and lyre and "send him drawn by swans (kúkvoiç hz o%ov) to Mount Helikon" (Him. Or. 46.6, trans. Campbell; Rutherford 2001:278 n. 11 translates "carried by swans"). This translation suggests that Apollo used a chariot drawn by swans (cf. Page 1955:249), but ercoxoç has the meaning "mounted upon some- thing," whether a horse or a chariot; on the other hand, it is not prob- able that the god was carried upon more than a single swan, and his swan-chariot seems to explain the passage in a satisfactory manner. His arrival at Helikon rather than Delphi does not suggest the departure and arrival of the deity and is only mentioned as a proof for the exis- tence of Apollos swan chariot outside the well-known poem of Alcaeus. Delian Apollo After reviewing the Athenian and Delphian evidence, it remains to ana- lyze the Delian calendar. According to the Delians (and Athenians), Apollo was born on the seventh of Thargêliôn (Apollod. FGrHist 244F37 = D.L. 3.2; Anon. Vita Plat. 389.51-52 Westermann), and Farnell believes this was the date of the Dêlia-Apollônia, calling the festival "a Delian Thargêlia" (1907:278, 289-291). 26 He adds that Theophrastuss account of the Apollo in whose honor the Athenians celebrate the Thargêlia with dances around the temple of Apollo Delios refers to this Delian festival (fr. 119 Wimmer ap. Ath. 10.424EF), but it is more probable that it refers to the Athenian Thargêlia (cf. Bremmer 1983:319). Nonetheless, the Delian month of Thargêliôn corresponded misapprehension of Faure 1963:501. For the coins ofTylissos, see for example Svoronos 1890:328-330 with PL 30.29-33, 31.1-7. 26) Cf. Homolle 1892:56; Robert 1886:161-162, but opting for the H ieros, 165-167, corresponding to the Delphian Bysios, cf.

Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 to the Athenian Thargêlion (IG1 ii. 1635.3-5 = 28A3-5 Rhodes and Osborne; Homolle 1881:27; West 1934:3, 9; Samuel 1972:99; Triimpy 1997:64), which firmly connects it with the spring epiphany of Apollo. Concerning Apollos departure from and arrival at Delos, in the first place we have the testimony of Menander Rhetor (Peri epideiktikôn 1.4, Rhet. Grae. 35, iii. 336.8-1 1 Spengler) who, writing of the apopemptic hymns, says they are delivered over actual or supposed departures of the gods, like Apollo's departure (a7roôr|n.ía) from Delos. This departure of Apollon could be associated with his visit and habitation among the Hyperboreans during the winter months. Secondly, whether Apollo (in Verg. A. 4.143-144) winters in Lycia and leaves for Delos in spring or summer (thus Serv. A. 4. 143 claimed he gave responses at Patara for six winter months, and at Delos in summer months), or whether it is Lycia he leaves in the winter, hibernam (Weber 2002:323-324), 27 this coun- try is inconceivable as a winter abode for someone usually abiding on Delos, as much as Delos is inconceivable as a winter abode for someone abiding in Lycia. There must have existed some connection between Lycia and Hyperborea, and we find it in the personage of Olen. "Olen of Lycia" was an early poet who came to Delos and wrote a hymn for Arge and Opis (Hdt. 4.35.3; cf. Call. Del. 305-306). Coming from Lycia, he also wrote a hymn for Eileithyia sung by the Delians (Paus. 1.18.5, 8.21.3, 9.27.2), and a hymn for Achaeia whom he claimed had arrived on Delos from Hyperborea (5.7.8). Alexander Polyhistor (FGrHist 273F64) also claimed that Olen was a Lycian, but Suda (co 71 s.v. 'QÄi|v), although citing both Callimachus and Alexander, men- tioned he could be a Hyperborean. Moreover, Pausanias knew of a Hyperborean Olen, who actually established the oracle at Delphi and was the first prophet; he cites a local poetess Boio, who wrote a hymn to the Delphians in which she sang of the event (10.5.7-8). Thus there either were two Olens associated with the greatest Apollonian sanctuar- ies, one from Lycia and the other from Hyperborea, or there was only one; but which is the "original" one? Both Lycia and Hyperborea were associated with Apollo, but when speaking of "wintering" and "arrivals" 27) Cf. Simon. PMG 519.55 mentioning together Lycian Apollo (1), daughters of the Delians (3), and the arrival of spring (7) (Rutherford 1990:177-179). It is probable that this is an invocation to Apollo to come from Lycia to Delos at the beginning of spring.</page><page sequence="19">T. Bilie / Numen 59 (2012) 509-532 52 7 one is led to support the Hyperborean cause. Our third body of evidence concerning the arrival of Apollo at Delos from the north consists of a tradition according to which the gravid Leto arrived at Delos after twelve days and nights of travelling from Hyperborea, although we do not hear of her means of transportation, other than the wolf form she had assumed (Arist. HA 6.35.580al7-18; Ael. NA 4.4; Antig. 61; Philosteph. Hist.^r. 32 FHGiii.33 ap. I A. R. 2.123-129a, p. 134 Wendel; Plu. Quaest. Nat. 38, not found in Greek but in a later Latin translation). Conclusion After discussing all the available evidence, we are unfortunately still left with "the middle of summer" as our only calendar information regard- ing the supposed arrival of Apollo from the north at Delphi. The local month name should also be taken into consideration, and it supports Alcaeus's description. After reviewing some of the evidence we have just described, Olmsted came to the conclusion "that his [Apollos] associa- tion with the sun may have been an ancient aspect of his association with Midsummer and the harvest" (1994:137), contra Farnell, who concluded "that Apollo-Helios was a late by-product in Greek religion" (1907:144). Through an analysis of Athenian, Delphian, and Delian calendars, together with literary sources pertaining to the subject, we can concur with Olmsted's conclusion. Yet the deity's association with the harvest is only of secondary interest, since it was certainly not the primary characteristic of the "model." As a model for a phenomenon of objective reality, the annual movement of the sun, reflected in the change of the seasons, defining the organization of the cosmos - both categories are certainly of a collective interest, although the second is bordering on the metaphysical - Apollo's behavior is defined by cer- tain rules in terms of mythological narrative, resulting in a model of the annual solar movement that can be defined as metaphorical - or, since myth can be defined as a metaphor on the narrative level (Burkert 1979:28), as mythical.</page><page sequence="20">528 T.
