<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOPHRASTUS ON THE PRESOCRATIC CAUSES BY JOHN B. McDIARMID THE most important ancient writing on the history of European thought was the Physical Opinions of Theophrastus.1 In this work of sixteen or eighteen books Theophrastus gave for the first time a systematic treatment of earlier views on the main problems of science and philosophy. Its influence in antiquity is attested by the frequency and respect with which it was referred to by later ancient writers. But its unique position was not fully appreciated by modern scholars until Usener2 collected the fragments of it and Diels scrutinized these fragments in relation to the large body of other doxographical writings. Diels proved that these writings, far from being isolated and independent, were virtually all derived directly or indirectly from the Physical Opinions.3 This fact has been of great consequence for the evaluation of both the doxographers and Theo- phrastus. Statements of such writers as Aetius have been invested with the full authority of Theophrastus, and, on the other hand, this authority has seemingly been enhanced by the very number of the doxographers who accepted it. When a report has been traced back to the Physical Opinions, scholars have been satisfied that it has been traced to an "unimpeachable source" and that it "must have been based on direct acquaintance" with the original Presocratic writing. That Theophrastus himself was not isolated has long been com- mon knowledge. Parallels between his statements and those of Aristotle have frequently been noted by Zeller and others. Two years before Diels published his Doxographi Graeci Zeller presented a paper in which he called attention to the similarity between certain fragments from the first book of the Physical Opinions and Aristotle's survey of earlier causal theories in Metaphysics A; 4 and in his notes to the Physical Opinions fragments Diels indicated further parallels. Zeller's conclusion was "Theophrast habe sich in seiner Ubersicht iiber die Geschichte der Physik, trotz der Selbstandigkeit seines Wissens und seines Urtheils, die er auch hier an der Tag legt, und trotz der Modifikationen, welche die eigentiimliche Natur seiner Aufgabe n6thig machte, an die tUbersicht iiber die philosophischen Principien, die Aristoteles im ersten Buch der Metaphysik gegeben</page><page sequence="2">John B. McDiarmid hatte, in umfassender Weise angeschlossen." 5 This has been the general view. The similarities between the statements of Theophrastus and Aristotle have been seen not as disproof of Theophrastus' value but, rather, as corroboration of Aristotle based on an independent judgment of the original evidence. Indeed, Theophrastus has been regarded as the more trustworthy witness of the two; for, while it is granted that Aristotle's statements about his predecessors may be colored by his own philosophical bias, it is maintained that Theo- phrastus is an objective historian and, therefore, free from this fault. The question of Aristotle's bias has been dealt with exhaustively by H. Cherniss in his Aristotle's Criticism of Presocratic Philosophy.6 Cherniss has found that Aristotle's accounts of earlier doctrines are so inextricably bound up with arguments for his own doctrine that history cannot be easily distinguished from interpretation. Aristotle is not interested in historical facts as such at all. He is constructing his own system of philosophy, and his predecessors are of interest to him only insofar as they furnish material to this end. He believes that his system is final and inclusive and that, therefore, all earlier thinkers have been groping toward it and can be stated in its terms. Holding this belief, he does not hesitate to modify or distort not only the detailed views but also the fundamental attitudes of his predecessors or to make articulate the implications that doctrines may have for him but could not have had for their authors. His method of dealing with his predecessors is to set up debates between them. Each debate is resolved in the formulation of one of his own theories, and the grouping and sentiments of the participants vary as the predetermined solution of each debate requires. Thus, there is no constancy in the historical value of his comments; nor is there even such a thing as the Aristotelian interpretation. In this respect the survey of Metaphysics A is no different from similar passages found elsewhere.7 There Aristotle marshals the early doctrines in such a way as to establish that all philosophers have been seeking, knowingly or not, to achieve his system of four causes and that none had ever put forward any other type of cause than these. Behind his argument is the assumption that the main problem of earlier philosophy was causality and that the cause that first and chiefly engaged the attention of the Presocratics was the material cause. The Presocratics as a group are set up as champions of matter, and on the opposing side is Plato, who is champion of the formal cause. The opposition is resolved by Aristotle's synthesis of matter and form. As Cherniss has said, Aristotle's purpose makes it natural 86</page><page sequence="3">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes that the details of his account should be unhistorical, and it is not surprising to find that the fragments of the Presocratics do not con- firm the view that their interest was primarily in the material con- stituents into which existence could be analyzed. Further, although this particular interpretation of the Presocratics runs through many of Aristotle's discussions, this fact does not lend greater weight to it. Each instance is explicable by the argument in which it occurs, and, when it does not suit the argument, Aristotle modifies or abandons it. One result of Cherniss' findings is that further investigation must be made of the relationship of Theophrastus to Aristotle. It is no longer possible to suppose that the similarities between their accounts of the Presocratics are due merely to agreement on specific historical data. Nor is it enough to explain these similarities as being due to the influence on Theophrastus of Aristotle's "bias for the abstract and metaphysical point of view." In each case the Aristotelian passage that Theophrastus has used must be examined in its context with regard to the purpose of Aristotle's argument, the assumptions on which he is proceeding, and the particular distortion of the early doctrine that has resulted therefrom; and each interpretation must be seen not only in relation to the fragments of the Presocratics themselves but also in relation to the other interpretations of Aristotle which Theophrastus may or may not have adopted. To be complete this investigation must ultimately include the writings of the later doxographers as well as the fragments of Theophrastus. But each doxographer raises individual problems in addition to those that are due to the common dependence on Theophrastus' work. The first step is, therefore, to consider the attested fragments from the Physical Opinions. The present study will be further limited to frag- ments on Presocratic causes from the first book of this work. This choice has been made not only because these fragments have been by far the most important for the reconstruction of Presocratic philos- ophy but also because they demonstrate most clearly Theophrastus' method of using Aristotle and the types of interpretation and mis- representation that may come from it. Before we turn to the fragments a few remarks should be made about their immediate source and their condition. Most of the attested fragments from the first book of the Physical Opinions are derived from Simplicius' comments on Aristotle, Physics 184 B 15 if., in which Aristotle is schematizing all the possible views of the physical principles. Aristotle says that the principles must be either (i) one or (2) more than one. If (i) one, it must be either (a) 87</page><page sequence="4">John B. McDiarmid motionless, as Parmenides and Melissus assert, or (b) in motion, as the physicists hold, some fixing on air as the principle and others, on water. If (2) more than one, the principles must be either (a) finite or (b) infinite in number. If (a) finite, then they must be two, three, four, or some other number. If (b) infinite, then either (i), as Democritus holds, one in kind but differing in shape or (ii) different in kind and even contrary. Simplicius elaborates this scheme, identifies the philosophers under each heading, and gives brief statements from the Physical Opinions in support of his identifications. The following is a summary of his identifications. The principles, he says, must be either (i) one or (2) more than one (Phys. p. 22, 22-23). If (i) one, it must be either (a) motionless or (b) in motion (ibid., p. 22, 23). If (I) one and (a) motionless, it must be either (i) infinite, as Melissus seems to say, (ibid., p. 22, 23-24) or (ii) finite, as Par- menides says, (ibid., p. 22, 24-25). (Xenophanes declared his one principle to be neither finite nor infinite and neither in motion nor motionless [ibid., p. 22, 26-28].) If (I) one and (b) in motion, the principle must be either (i) finite, as is held by Thales and Hippo (ibid., p. 23, 21-23) and by Heraclitus and Hippasus (ibid., pp. 23, 34-24, 2) or (ii) infinite, as is held by Anaximander (ibid., p. 24, 13-15) and by Anaximenes and Diogenes (ibid., p. 24, 26-28, and p. 25, I-4). If (2) more than one, the principles must be either (a) finite or (b) infinite (ibid., p. 25, 14). If (2) more than one and (a) finite, they must be (i) two, as Parmenides (ibid., p. 25, I5-I6) and the Stoics (ibid., p. 25, I6-18) hold, or (ii) three, as Aristotle (ibid., p. 25, 18-19) and Plato (ibid., p. 26, 5-7), or (iii) four, as Empedocles (ibid., p. 25, 21-22), or (iv) ten, as the Pythagoreans (ibid., p. 26, 27). If (2) more than one and (b) infinite in number, the principles must be either (i) simple and the same in kind, as Leucippus, Democritus, and Metrodorus hold (ibid., pp. 26, 31-27, I; 28, 4-I0; 28, I5; 28, 27-28), or (ii) complex, different in kind, and opposite, as Anaxagoras and Archelaus hold (ibid., p. 27, 2-5 and 23-36). The arrangement of doctrines given by Simplicius is dictated by the passage on which he is commenting, and it is clearly not the arrangement of Theophrastus.8 Aristotle begins his survey in Meta- physics 983 B 20 ff. with Thales, and Theophrastus almost certainly did so too. Not only does Thales head the list in all the doxographers; Simplicius says that, according to Theophrastus, Thales was the first to reveal the investigation of nature to the Greeks (Phys., p. 23, 29-30). Theophrastus probably concluded his history of causes, as Aristotle does, with Plato, since Simplicius says: o tLe'vToL ?Eopa(rTro 88</page><page sequence="5">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes rTOV aAAovs 7rpo4Crrop raas "TOV7rot , Ty7trqv, HErtyio/Av1evos IXAaT(ov KTC." (ibid., p. 26, 7-8). What the original sequence of the philosophers between Thales and Plato was cannot be definitely settled. It seems likely that Theophrastus had followed the plan of Aristotle in Metaphysics A in arranging the doctrines in such a way as to demonstrate the revelation of the four causes. Such an arrangement is implied in the statement that Anaxagoras "supplied the missing cause" (ibid., p. 27, 4), for this can only mean that philosophers before Anaxagoras had not given an adequate cause of motion. It is likely, too, that philosophers came after - although not always immediately after - those on whom they are said to be dependent or against whom they are said to have re- acted. Thus Anaximander probably came after Thales (ibid., p. 24, I3-I4), Anaximenes after Anaximander (ibid., p. 24, 26), Anaxagoras after Anaximenes (ibid., p. 27, 2-3), Archelaus after Anaxagoras (ibid., p. 27, 23-24), Xenophanes after Anaximander (Dox., p. 482, 7-8), Parmenides after Xenophanes (Simplicius, Phys., p. 22, 27-29), Empedocles after Parmenides (ibid., p. 25, I9-20), Leucippus after Parmenides (ibid., p. 28, 4-6), Democritus after Leucippus (ibid., p. 28, 15-16), and Metrodorus after Democritus (ibid., p. 28, 27-28). In some instances, however, Theophrastus seems to have broken the chronological order, as Aristotle does in the Metaphysics, so as to bring together philosophers who held similar doctrines but were widely separated in time. Thus, Hippo is linked to Thales, Diogenes to Anaximenes, and Heraclitus to Hippasus. Farther than this it is im- possible to go with much confidence, and in this paper the fragments will be taken up in the order suggested by Usener and accepted by Diels in the Doxographi Graeci. The content of Simplicius' comments has also been influenced by the Physics passage. The sentences with which he introduces each group of philosophers are clearly patterned on similar sentences in Physics I84 B I5 ff. and are certainly not from Theophrastus. It is evident, too, that the criteria by which Simplicius divides the doctrines are not always those employed by Theophrastus. Simplicius follows the Physics scheme, in which the physical principles are divided only as to their number, motion, and extent. It is clear from the fragments, however, that Theophrastus was concerned with the principles not only as physical constituents but also as causes of motion, as form, and as end. This difference - along with the fact that Simplicius' scheme is analytical, while Theophrastus' was in part historical - has undoubtedly led to some differences in emphasis and detail. Sim- plicius' division of the monists into Ionians and Eleatics would, for 89</page><page sequence="6">John B. McDiarmid example, probably be represented by Theophrastus as a historical phenomenon due to the Eleatics' recognition of the efficient cause and failure to find it. Simplicius' further division of the Ionians into those whose principle was finite (Thales, Hippo, Hippasus, and Heraclitus) and those whose principle was infinite (Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Diogenes) is probably not from Theophrastus at all but is due to Simplicius' unjustified extension of the Physics scheme. In two places Aristotle attributes an infinite principle to all the physical monists,9 although, again, in one passage of the Physics he states that no physi- cist made fire infinite.10 This last statement may be Simplicius' au- thority for accepting the common Stoic interpretation of Heraclitus' fire as finite.11 No such explanation is possible in the case of Thales. None of the doxographers remarks as to whether his primitive water was conceived as being finite or infinite, and this silence is a good indication that nothing was found on the subject in Theophrastus. Aristotle's generalization that all the physicists made their principle infinite is undoubtedly, as Simplicius says in his comments there,12 meant to include Thales; but it is improbable that Aristotle or anyone later knew what view, if any, Thales had expressed on this question. Theophrastus does say, according to Simplicius, that Anaximander was the first to use the term "Infinite" of his principle,l3 and Sim- plicius may have misunderstood this as meaning that the principles of philosophers before Anaximander were finite. The inclusion of Hippo and Hippasus with Thales and Heraclitus as proponents of finite prin- ciples probably has no other basis than Theophrastus' grouping of similar doctrines. Finally, there is the question of the general reliability of Simplicius as a source for the fragments of Theophrastus. In one section of his comments Simplicius confuses Theophrastus with the writer of the late treatise De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia and fails to see that the account of Alexander, to which he opposes this treatise, has been derived from Theophrastus. To account for this confusion Diels made the plausible suggestion that Simplicius did not have the original text of the Physical Opinions but collected excerpts from the lost com- mentary of Alexander on the Physics.14 If Diels was right, the frag- ments preserved by Simplicius are at best a quotation of a quotation, and there is no way of knowing how exactly Simplicius reproduced what he found in Alexander or how exactly Alexander had quoted from Theophrastus. Any discussion of the fragments that depends on the precise wording given by Simplicius is, therefore, open to the charge that the evidence will not stand such treatment. When all such con- 90</page><page sequence="7">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes siderations are taken into account, the fact remains that Simplicius is the best available source for Theophrastus' discussion of the prin- ciples; and it will be assumed in the present study that, with the exceptions mentioned in this and the two preceding paragraphs, Sim- plicius has repeated substantially what Theophrastus wrote. THALES AND HIPPO A comparison of the account of Thales' principle quoted by Sim- plicius from Theophrastus with that given by Aristotle in the Meta- physics leaves little doubt of Theophrastus' dependence on Aristotle.15 The similarities between the two accounts are so striking that, if they were not found in the account of Aetius, which is also derived from Theophrastus, it might be suspected that Simplicius had himself copied directly from the Metaphysics. Both Theophrastus and Aris- totle report that Thales declared water to be the principle of all things; that he arrived at this theory from the observation that the seeds of all things are moist, that nutriment is moist, and that the warm lives by the moist (Theophrastus adds that Thales observed that dying things dry up, and Aristotle, that the warm is generated from the moist); that he held that, since water is the principle, the earth rests on it. Theophrastus concludes his account with the remark that Thales was reported to have been the first to reveal the investi- gation of nature to the Greeks, that, although he had many predeces- sors, he was so superior to them as to eclipse them. This last is a synopsis of an allusion by Aristotle to a tradition that Homer and the early cosmologists had held views about nature similar to that of Thales.16 The simple statement that Thales declared water to be the principle of all things does not disclose precisely how Theophrastus is using the word "principle" nor what assumptions about Thales' doctrine are required by it. Aristotle settles these questions in the prefatory re- marks before his account of Thales; and, since the assumptions that he makes there underlie all the accounts of matter that Theophrastus has taken from Metaphysics A, it will be well to discuss them at the outset. For Aristotle the ultimate material principle is a substrate which persists but undergoes changes of quality. This concept - or, rather, an approximation of it - was held, Aristotle believes, by all his predecessors, and he asserts that it is found even among the earliest thinkers.17 He says: "That of which all things consist, the first from which they are generated, the last into which they are destroyed - the substance remaining, but changing in its modifications - this, they 9I</page><page sequence="8">John B. McDiarmid say, is the element and principle of things; and, therefore, they think that nothing is generated or destroyed, since they believe that this sort of entity is always preserved. . ." 18 The effect of this is that all the early thinkers are represented as sharing Aristotle's analytical and abstract concern with matter. Lack of firsthand evidence from the writings of the early physicists prevents the complete resolution of doubts that may be held about the view of matter that Aristotle attrib- utes to them - though the fact that he can seriously comment on the material theory of Homer in the same context with those of the physi- cists makes doubt not unreasonable. With regard to the concept of matter that he attributes to them, however, there can be no doubt. This concept rests on the combination of two ideas: the definition of identity and difference as formulated in consequence of Eleatic logic, and the distinction between subject and attribute as developed first by Socrates and Plato.19 It is, therefore, an obvious historical impossibil- ity that any Presocratic should have held this concept. If Thales did say that all things come from water, he cannot have meant that water is a principle in the sense that Aristotle and Theophrastus use the word. The entire doxographical tradition about his principle is, thus, spoiled at its source by an anachronism, an anachronism that becomes the more deceptive for being removed from its original context. Two differences between the accounts of Theophrastus and Aristotle deserve notice. In the Theophrastus fragment the same doctrine and the same arguments for that doctrine are ascribed to Hippo as well as to Thales; but Aristotle, after completing his account of Thales, dis- misses Hippo with the contemptuous remark that "no one would think fit to associate him with these (i.e., physicists such as Thales) because of the paltriness of his mind." '2 Secondly, the statement of Thales' doctrine in Theophrastus is definite; but Aristotle says cautiously that "perhaps" Thales got his notion this way and that Thales "is said" to have declared himself thus about the first cause.21 Aristotle's only other explicit reference to Hippo - again scorn- ful - is to the effect that Hippo said the soul is made of water.22 The reason that Aristotle ascribes to Hippo for believing the soul to be water is one of those that he ascribes to Thales - and Theophrastus ascribes to both Thales and Hippo - for the belief that water is the principle of all things, namely, that the seed of all things is moist. The further observation ascribed to both Thales and Hippo by Theophras- tus, that there is a connection between an organism's health and its moisture, is ascribed to Hippo alone in Meno's latrica. Hippo is there said to have held that consciousness and health depend on an internal 92</page><page sequence="9">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes moisture; when this moisture is in its normal condition the animal is healthy, but when it dries up the animal loses consciousness and dies.23 Arguments of this sort are characteristic of the physiological specula- tions that accompanied the rise of scientific medicine in the fifth cen- tury B.C. At the time of Thales the prevailing interest appears to have been meteorological.24 Probably he arrived at whatever notions he had of water from the observation of such phenomena as rain and evapora- tion, and the physiological arguments ascribed by Theophrastus to both Thales and Hippo are in fact those of Hippo alone. Theophrastus has apparently inferred from Aristotle's mention of Thales and Hippo in the same context that Aristotle considers their doctrines to be in all respects similar. The inference is plainly mistaken; the fact that Aris- totle considers Thales seriously but excludes Hippo can only mean that he believes their doctrines to have differed in some important aspect. The definiteness of Theophrastus' statement seems likewise due to failure to reproduce Aristotle's meaning exactly. Certainly, little can have been known of Thales by the fourth century B.C. Aristotle is the earliest writer to represent him as a philosopher, and the cautious tone of Aristotle's few other references to him leaves the impression that Aristotle knows little of him and recognizes the limit of his knowl- edge.25 Little more may have been known about Hippo, but at least the important part played by water in his physiological theories was known, as, apparently, were the arguments on which he based his theories. Aristotle seems to believe that Hippo revived the earlier Milesian doctrine. He therefore suggests that Thales' arguments for the primacy of water may have been the same as those of his supposed successor. Simplicius reports, probably from Theophrastus, that Thales was said to have left nothing in writing but a work on nautical astronomy; 26 and there is no evidence that Theophrastus had any information about Thales' views on causality other than what is given in the Metaphysics. In its original form Theophrastus' account may have been as guarded as Aristotle's is. But in the quotation of it as given by Simplicius and in the doxographers such caution is absent. What had been for Aristotle at best a conjecture on a very uncertain tradition has become in them a historical fact. HERACLITUS AND HIPPASUS In the Metaphysics Aristotle says of Hippasus and Heraclitus only that they made their principle fire.27 To this Theophrastus adds that 93</page><page sequence="10">they held that fire is the substrate from which things are formed by rarefaction and condensation and into which they are again dissolved; for according to Heraclitus, he says, "all things are an exchange for fire." 28 With the exception of the last few words, which Theophrastus apparently drew from Heraclitus' works, this addition is merely par- ticularization of Aristotle's general dicta that for all the material monists change was the alteration of a persisting substrate 29 and that they generated other things from the substrate by means of rarefaction and condensation.30 The presupposition on which this account of Heraclitus is based is the same as that already noted in connection with Thales, that the material principles of the Ionians were approximations of the Aris- totelian prime matter and differed from one another only in the names by which they were called.31 Even without firsthand evidence from the texts of the Ionians this representation of their notions of matter may be discounted. In the case of Heraclitus it may be disproved by ref- erence to extant fragments of his writings. These show that he did not conceive fire as inert matter. The central point of his doctrine is, on the contrary, the constant flux of all things, including fire. The essen- tial characteristic of fire is not its persistence as a substrate but rather its very impermanence, in which Heraclitus found at the same time both an explanation of the endless change of the phenomenal world and a visible symbol of that change.32 Theophrastus' misunderstanding of the nature of the Heraclitean fire as a single material principle causes him to attribute the rarefac- tion-condensation process to Heraclitus. It has long been recognized that this attribution is false. In making it Theophrastus not only reads into Heraclitus the Aristotelian theory of qualitative change; he also involves his account in a curious difficulty and forces on Heraclitus' words an interpretation they will not bear. For the Peripatetics rare- faction-condensation implied an undifferentiated substrate that is informed by the contrary qualities rare and dense, i.e., hot and cold. Since according to their view fire is the rarest of the four simple bodies, it cannot be subject to rarefaction. In order to attribute both rarefac- tion and condensation to Heraclitus, therefore, Theophrastus must disregard the primary nature of fire and treat fire as something inter- mediate between rare and dense, i.e., an approximation of his own prime matter. That he does so seems clear from the distinction he makes between rarefaction-condensation and dissolution into the sub- strate; 33 for, if fire is really fire and not something intermediate in density, dissolution is simply rarefaction. Heraclitus himself said that John B. McDiarmid 94</page><page sequence="11">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes all things are an exchange for fire, and fire for all things, as wares for gold, and gold for wares.34 Theophrastus refers to this simile to prove that Heraclitus employed rarefaction-condensation. But, whatever the figure may have meant for Heraclitus, it is not suitable as a de- scription of rarefaction-condensation; for in the exchange of wares for gold the value of the substance remains, but the substance does not.35 Theophrastus' account of Heraclitus' theory of change provides an interesting example of the way he may derive his interpretations from Aristotle and yet give an incomplete and erroneous presentation even of Aristotle's views by selecting certain statements and disregarding others. In Metaphysics A, which has been Theophrastus' chief source, Aristotle is concerned with Heraclitus' fire only as it squares with his own concept of material causality. And, when he is seeking ante- cedents for his theory of contrariety, he would certainly hold that for Heraclitus as a monist all change must be due to rarefaction and con- densation. When, however, he is concerned with proving the impossi- bility of any of the four simple bodies as a single principle, he ascribes rarefaction-condensation to those who made their principle water or air or a body midway between air and water in density; 36 but he says Heraclitus held that things are formed from a composition of fire as from the melting down of metal scrapings.37 How the process of smelt- ing is to be applied to the generation of things from fire is not clear. The figure is at any rate not appropriate to signify rarefaction-con- densation, and Aristotle's use of it is certain evidence that he cannot express Heraclitus' doctrine in his usual terms.38 Similarly, Aristotle asserts that most of his predecessors were agreed that interaction could occur only between unlike or opposite things.39 Under the influence of this view, in the De Sensibus Theophrastus attributes to Heraclitus the theory that perception is due to the interaction of opposites and involves alteration.40 When, however, Aristotle comes to an indi- vidual consideration of Heraclitus' doctrine of the soul, he implies that Heraclitus believed interaction to be between similars, for he says that according to Heraclitus that which is in motion is known by that which is in motion.41 The reference in Metaphysics A is the only one that Aristotle makes to Hippasus, and, since Hippasus is said to have left no writings, probably nothing more was known of him in the Alexandrian age.42 Because Aristotle classes him with the material monists, Theophrastus has concluded that he employed rarefaction-condensation. Aristotle would subscribe to this conclusion as the necessary consequence of 95</page><page sequence="12">John B. McDiarmid Hippasus' use of a single material principle, but it is doubtful that he would claim that this was in fact the stated view of Hippasus. He introduces Hippasus in Metaphysics A only as an example of an earlier philosopher who had, like Heraclitus, made his principle fire. It may not be inferred from this that he thinks that the doctrines of the two had any further resemblances. Later accounts that link them in the belief that fire is god,43 that the soul is fire-like,44 and that the universe is in eternal motion, and subject to periodic change,45 are apparently only further interpretations of Theophrastus' interpretation. ANAXIMANDER According to Simplicius' quotation from Theophrastus, Anaximan- der held that the Infinite is the principle of things, and he said that this is not water or any of the so-called elements but some other in- finite body out of which are generated all the heavens and the worlds in them; things pass away into those things from which they are generated by necessity; for they make reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice in accordance with the order of time, as Anaximander said in somewhat poetic words.46 In the historical synopsis of the Metaphysics Aristotle does not mention Anaximander by name. Elsewhere he gives two distinct and apparently contradictory accounts of Anaximander's principle: that it is a single body apart from the elements; and that it is a mixture like the mixture of Empedocles.47 There is general agreement that the latter part of Theophrastus' account contains a fragment from the work of Anaximander, although there has been much debate as to how far the fragment extends, how much it has been altered in transmission, and what it means. It will be necessary to deal briefly with these questions before discussing the possible connection between Theophrastus' account and those of Aris- totle. It may be taken as certain that the reference to Anaximander's "somewhat poetic words" indicates direct quotation and applies at least to the metaphorical statement that things make reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice. The preceding clause, which states that things pass away into those things from which they are generated, has been accepted as substantially, if not verbally, an accurate representation of Anaximander's thought. If this is so, the explanatory "for" that links this clause to the metaphor permits only one interpretation, namely, that the metaphor is a poetic expression for the process of generation and destruction. Accordingly, the un- 96</page><page sequence="13">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes specified subject of the metaphor must be the things that are generated and destroyed; the payment of reparation and satisfaction is equated with destruction; and the injustice that is so expiated must be due in some way to generation. Most attempts to reconstruct Anaximander's doctrine depend on some such interpretation of the text as this. But the two clauses cannot be connected in the way supposed. They ex- press two quite distinct relationships which do not explain each other. The dissolution of things into those things from which they are gener- ated involves the relationship of particular things to their source. The metaphorical clause, on the other hand, suggests the opposition of equals in a court of law and the compensation of one equal by the other for a wrong committed. There can be no such equality between particular things and the Infinite nor can there be any question of the generation and existence of a thing being an injustice against the Infinite.48 And to say that the dissolution of a particular thing into the Infinite is the same as the payment of reparation to the thing's injured opponent is to ascribe to Anaximander a concept of law that no Greek of his time would have understood. As has frequently been noted, the metaphor refers to the jus talionis. According to this the expiation of a wrong is settled between the interested parties and their immediate kin; reparation is made directly to the sufferer and not to some third superior authority, which in this case must be the Infinite. The key to the problem is the clause about generation and destruc- tion. The observation that on death things are resolved once more into that from which they were generated is a commonplace in Greek literature, and it is definitely attested in philosophical writings as early as Xenophanes.49 But the language in which it is here cast belongs to a later period, and both the language and form recall similar state- ments in Aristotle.50 One of these occurs in a passage of the Meta- physics which has influenced Theophrastus' treatment of all the Ionians. Aristotle says that most of the early philosophers thought that the principles in the form of matter were the only principles of all things, for, he says, they thought that the element or principle of things is "that of which all things consist, that from which they are first generated and into which they are finally destroyed." 51 In the extant fragments of the Physical Opinions this notion of circular change is ascribed to Hippasus and Heraclitus as well as to Anaxi- mander; and in derived doxographical accounts it is ascribed to all the Ionians.52 With Aristotle's statement may be compared, for example, the following from Aetius: "Anaximander says that the Infinite is the principle, for all things are generated from this and all things are 97</page><page sequence="14">John B. McDiarmid destroyed into this." 53 The conclusion is unavoidable. What Theo- phrastus has done is apply to the Ionians individually what Aristotle has asserted of them as a group.54 The probability that Theophrastus is quoting or paraphrasing from Anaximander is, therefore, no greater or less than that Aristotle and he are quoting or paraphrasing from any other member of the group. Aristotle does not claim that any of the Ionians formulated the principle of circular change in so many words; and, far from regarding this principle as an unique feature of Anaximander's doctrine, he does not mention Anaximander in Meta- physics A at all.55 He is intimating what he thinks must have been the Ionians' reasoning about the nature of the material cause.56 Theo- phrastus' intention is evidently the same. The generation-destruction clause is not to be connected with the metaphor; and it does not refer to any special view of Anaximander but to the view that he supposes Anaximander held in common with the other Ionians. This solution does not remove all the difficulties from the passage, but it does clear the way for understanding the function of the meta- phor. Reference to the cycle of generation and destruction is made parenthetically to identify the Infinite as the material substratum. The things generated from the Infinite and destroyed into it are things in general, including the heavens and the worlds in them. The things of the metaphor are things of a special sort, things that are opposed and that wrong each other. The only such things of which Theophras- tus speaks are the "so-called elements." The gist of the passage, then, is this: Anaximander declared the Infinite to be the principle of all things (i.e., that out of which all things are generated and into which they are destroyed); and he said that the Infinite is some body which is not water or any of the other so-called elements, for, as he said, "they make reparation and satisfaction to each other for their in- justice." Thus, Theophrastus is quoting what appears to be Anaxi- mander's justification of his own doctrine against Thales and any one else who made one of the opposed elements the primordial matter. The thread of the argument has been obscured, probably by Sim- plicius.57 But it is clear that Simplicius, too, understood the subject of the metaphor to be the elements and took the metaphor as Anaxi- mander's argument for the existence of a separate Infinite. Immedi- ately after the metaphor he adds the comment that Anaximander ob- served the change of the elements into one another and thought, therefore, that the substratum must be othcr than the elements.58 Theophrastus does not say by what intermediate step he believes Anaximander to have proceeded from the opposition of the elements 98</page><page sequence="15">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes to the conclusion that the Infinite must be other than the elements. The missing step may be readily supplied: if one of the elements were the Infinite, the other elements could no longer restrain its injustice by compelling it to pay retribution, and they would, consequently, be destroyed by it. The argument is given in full by Aristotle in the first of his interpretations mentioned above. He says that some philoso- phers set up the Infinite as the source of the elements and other than them because the elements are contrary to one another and, if one of them were infinite, it would destroy the others.59 He does not mention Anaximander by name, but it is almost certain that he is thinking primarily of him. Theophrastus has accepted Aristotle's reconstruc- tion of Anaximander's reasoning and has submitted Anaximander's metaphor as evidence - probably the very evidence used by Aristotle in the first place. Aristotle and Theophrastus assume that by the Infinite Anaximan- der sought to correct doctrines whose single infinite material principle was one of the elements; he had, like the other Ionians, accepted as real the diversity of the physical world, but he had seen that the consequence of the destruction of opposites by one another must be that in a universe such as Thales' there could never be anything but an infinite mass of one element. Now, the name given by Anaximander to his principle does suggest that he may have reasoned that the infinite diversity of things could be accounted for only by some prin- ciple that was no single thing but was the source of all things. But Theophrastus and Aristotle throw no light on what his reasoning was. Their interpretation clearly presupposes that he had subscribed to the specifically Aristotelian notion of the equilibrium of the contraries and the genesis of the four simple bodies through the interaction of the contraries on undifferentiated matter.60 This interpretation is proved unhistorical if only by the fact - acknowledged by Aristotle himself - that Empedocles introduced the concept of four elements. The further errors in supposing the Infinite to be undifferentiated matter in the Aristotelian sense will be demonstrated presently. The implication of such a material principle as Aristotle and Theo- phrastus attribute to Anaximander would for them be that all change must be qualitative.61 But Simplicius, probably on Theophrastus' authority, says that Anaximander held generation to be not the quali- tative change of the material principle but the separation of the con- traries due to eternal motion.62 Simplicius notes that this is the reason why Aristotle groups Anaximander with Anaxagoras. In a later pas- sage he says that according to Theophrastus, too, the doctrines of 99</page><page sequence="16">John B. McDiarmid Anaximander and Anaxagoras are similar, for Anaximander said that in the process of separation from the Infinite like is borne to like and that particular things such as gold and earth are not generated but have existed previously in the Infinite.63 Theophrastus believes that the material principle of Anaxagoras may be considered either as a mixture of infinite particles or as a single body that is indeterminate in kind and size. In either case, he concludes, the material principles of Anaxagoras and Anaximander would appear to be similar. The meaning of this last passage is obvious: Theophrastus thinks it possible to consider the material principle of Anaximander both as a single indeterminate body and as a mixture. Since these two con- cepts appear to be incompatible, modern scholars who believe Anaxi- mander to have been a monist have sought to rescue Theophrastus from this difficulty by arguing that he does not mean to attribute a mixture to Anaximander.64 Their argument would make Simplicius guilty of misunderstanding Theophrastus. But there is no reason to doubt that Simplicius is reporting Theophrastus accurately; for Anaxi- mander is treated as a pluralist by St. Augustine, who wrote a century before Simplicius and derived material from Theophrastus through a different line of transmission.65 The seeming contradiction of Theo- phrastus must stand. How Theophrastus can treat the Infinite both as a single body and as a mixture becomes apparent from the passage of the Physics in which Aristotle gives his second interpretation of Anaximander.66 He distinguishes Anaximander, Anaxagoras, and Empedocles from the monists on the grounds that, whereas the monists derived plurality by condensation and rarefaction, these three separated the inherent con- traries from their material principle. This principle he designates both as a mixture and as the One; thus at the same time he sets Anaximander, Anaxagoras, and Empedocles off from the monists and he reduces them to essential identity with the monists by designating their principle as the One. He is enabled to do so without contradic- tion because he assumes that the mixture of these three is in fact not a mixture but a homogeneous body in which the four simple bodies are qualitatively suspended through the alteration of each in the direction of its opposite. Hence, although his use of the word "separate" im- plies the pre-existence in the mixture of contraries as distinct things, he is thinking of the contraries not as material ingredients but as the limits of the alteration of the prime matter; by the inherence of these contraries in the One he means the potential inherence of the con- traries in his chemical mixture; and by separation he means the actu- I00</page><page sequence="17">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes alization of these potential contraries.67 This passage is almost cer- tainly Theophrastus' second source, and his interpretation becomes intelligible in the light of it. By understanding Anaximander's mixture in the special sense in which Aristotle does here Theophrastus may with indifference speak of it now as a unity and now as a plurality, since regardless of the term he uses the result is the same; the Infinite is a unified substratum for alteration, and separation from the Infinite is simply that alteration. That Anaximander or any of the other Presocratics should have conceived the mixture in this way is highly improbable. Such a mix- ture presupposes the Aristotelian concept of qualitative change, a concept which, as has been seen, cannot have been held by any Pre- socratic. The mixture of the Presocratics in general was simply an aggregate of infinitesimal particles of things, and generation from the mixture was the separation of these particles. If Anaximander did speak of inherence in the mixture, then, he meant the inherence of actually existent things and not the inherence of anything like the Aristotelian contraries. If he referred to the Infinite in language that would suggest to the Peripatetics an indeterminate substance, he meant simply that in the Infinite no one thing so predominates as to give the Infinite any one definite character.68 Very probably he did think of the Infinite as containing particles of contrary things; but, apart from the accounts of Aristotle and Theophrastus and the doxog- raphy dependent on them, there is no evidence for the current notion that these contrary things were prototypes of the four simple bodies. If Aristotle has misinterpreted both the nature of the Infinite and the nature and functions of its constituent parts, and if Theophrastus has merely repeated his misinterpretation, what positive historical value have their accounts? Their attempt to make a monist of Anaximander is on a par with their similar treatment of Anaxagoras and Empedocles and is no more or less credible. But what is significant is that they feel constrained to group Anaximander with the pluralists at all. Since the result of their interpretation is that he turns out to be a monist, there appears to be no reason that they should not have considered him as a monist from the outset if they had any good evidence for doing so.69 The grouping of Anaximander with the pluralists, then, may be of some importance as a recognition of the fact that, however his doctrine may have differed from that of Anax- agoras or Empedocles, it was more closely related to theirs than to the monists'. Furthermore, it should be noted that, although the inter- pretation of Aristotle and Theophrastus are responsible for the em- IOI</page><page sequence="18">John B. McDiarmid phasis placed on contrariety in later accounts of Anaximander, their interpretations hardly justify that emphasis. In his second interpreta- tion Aristotle's aim is to prove that Anaximander recognized the function of contrariety in generation. He therefore fixes attention on the contraries because they are the only products of the separation from the Infinite that are important for his argument. He may intend to give the impression that all the products of separation are contrary, but he does not specifically say that Anaximander himself stated so. He speaks of the separation of contraries from the mixture of Anax- agoras in the same context, although a few lines later he makes it clear that he is aware that the homoeomeries include such things as flesh and bone.70 Theophrastus evidently believes that Anaximander's theory of change was like the homoeomery theory of Anaxagoras, and he gives as examples of things separated from the Infinite not only the contrary earth but also gold.71 Having seen in his account of Thales and Hippo how he may overinterpret Aristotle's association of two philosophers, we may doubt that he has any better authority for attributing the homoeomery theory to Anaximander than Aris- totle's statement that both Anaximander and Anaxagoras employed the process of separation from the mixture. But at any rate The- ophrastus is probably near the truth of the matter. Despite their at- tempt to reduce Anaximander to the terms of their own doctrines, therefore, both Aristotle and Theophrastus give indications of know- ing that Anaximander was a pluralist. And, however questionable may be the basis of Theophrastus' attribution of the homoeomery theory to Anaximander, the fact that he makes this attribution means that testimony derived from him cannot be used to support the mod- ern view that all the ingredients of the Infinite are contrary. ANAXIMENES AND DIOGENES Theophrastus says that Anaximenes agreed with Anaximander in declaring the substrate to be one and infinite but differed from him in making it a qualitatively defined substance, air.72 This principle, Anaximenes thought, varies in density and rareness; as it is rarefied it becomes fire; as it is condensed it becomes wind, cloud, water, earth, and stone according to the degree of condensation; and from these things the others are derived. Like Anaximander, he maintained that motion is eternal and that change is caused by it. The core of this passage is Aristotle's statement in the Metaphysics that Anaximenes and Diogenes believed air to be prior to water and to be the most 102</page><page sequence="19">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes primary of the simple bodies.73 The rest is for the most part drawn from other statements made by Aristotle regarding the monists in general without special reference to Anaximenes. He says that all the physicists consider the infinite an attribute of one of the elements; that all the physicists who make the substrate one of the elements generate other things by rarefaction and condensation; that all who employ a single principle such as air or water believe that it is in motion; and that all who believe that there is an infinite number of worlds, some being generated and some being destroyed, assume that motion is eternal.74 When Theophrastus speaks of air as a unitary substrate and uses Aristotle's technical word for this, he betrays once more the influence of Aristotle's tendency to interpret the Ionian principles as substrates of alteration; and it is safe to assume that his use of the word implies all the significance attached to it by Aristotle.75 One consequence of Ionian monism is, according to Aristotle, that generation and destruc- tion must be the qualitative change of the substrate; and, in order to accommodate the Ionian rarefaction and condensation theory to his own theory of qualitative change, he equates the rare and dense with the hot and cold, which are his contrary forces.76 The result of this for Anaximenes is that air becomes, in fact if not in name, a homoge- neous and qualitatively neutral body that is subject to alteration by the hot and cold. As in the case of Anaximander, however, Theophras- tus makes statements about Anaximenes' principle which would prove that air is not a substrate in the Aristotelian sense. The very name of Anaximenes' principle shows that he did not conceive it as qualita- tively neutral, and Theophrastus makes a point of distinguishing Anaximenes from Anaximander by the fact that air is qualitatively determined while the Infinite is not. And that air is not homogeneous and that the differentiation of air is not alteration is shown by the parallel he finds between the mechanism of change employed by Anaximenes and Anaximander. In saying that Anaximenes, like Anaximander, explained change by eternal motion he must mean that change results not from alteration but from some mechanical process which causes the emergence of things that are differentiated in their degree of extension and compression.77 It is likely that Anaximenes did consider fire, wind, cloud, water, earth, and stone to be products of the rarefaction and condensation of air. But it is doubtful that, as Theophrastus says, he derived other things from these. Theophrastus apparently supposes that he used two distinct processes of generation: rarefaction and condensation, I03</page><page sequence="20">John B. McDiarmid by which he accounted for certain primary differentiations, and com- bination, by which he formed compound things from these primary differentiations. But, if Anaximenes was satisfied to explain such seemingly diverse things as stone and cloud by the single process of rarefaction and condensation, it is hard to imagine that he would have felt the need for any kind of secondary process. And, since the sole difference between the supposed primary bodies is one of extension, the difference between the compounds of these bodies would presum- ably be the same, so that in its effect combination would be identical with rarefaction and condensation. The double process is needed only if the primary bodies are elements. Undoubtedly Theophrastus thinks that they are.78 Aristotle's theory is that the four simple bodies are produced through the action of the contraries on primary matter and that compound bodies are combinations of the simple bodies. The- ophrastus has found both substratum and contrariety in Aristotle's treatment of Anaximenes; and these two originative sources give rise to bodies which, although more numerous, are approximations of the Aristotelian simple bodies. The error in thinking that the differentia- tions of air are simple bodies of this sort needs no demonstration. It is sufficient to note that the Aristotelian theory involves qualitative change. Indeed, to postulate simple bodies of any sort is possible only if Anaximenes fails to apply his rarefaction-condensation principle rigorously. Either he did so fail, or-what is more likely- the things cited by Theophrastus are not primary differentiations at all but are merely a few striking examples drawn by Anaximenes from the whole scale of density, probably with the purpose of illustrating the operation of his theory. Theophrastus, like Aristotle, groups Diogenes of Apollonia with Anaximenes as holding the theory that air is the principle of things.79 He says, further, that Diogenes, too, maintained that air is infinite and eternal and that the form of other things comes to be from it when it is rarefied and condensed, i.e., when it changes in its modi- fications. In extant fragments Diogenes does describe air as an eternal and undying body, and he does say that there are modifications of air due to differences in heat and cold, dryness and dampness, greater and less mobility, etc. which arise and pass away.80 Theophrastus prob- ably had the writings of Diogenes available, but his treatment of Diogenes here is essentially the same as his treatment of Anaximenes and is probably from the same source.81 Diogenes' writings are at any rate no protection against the influence of Aristotle. With Aristotle, I04</page><page sequence="21">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes Theophrastus infers that, since the principle is referred to in the singular, unity in the Eleatic sense is meant. The eternity of the prin- ciple as opposed to the transitoriness of its modifications points to its being a persistent substrate of change. And the identification of rare- faction and condensation with qualitative change is facilitated by the fact that Diogenes seems himself to have equated the rare and dense with the hot and cold.82 But the air of Diogenes is no more an Aristotelian substrate than is that of Anaximenes. When he refers to air as "manifold," he is referring not to the qualification of air by the contraries but to the numberless modifications that he says "are in it." These modifications are quantitative. He says that all things have a share of air but the share of each thing is not the same as that of any other thing. To be sure, he distinguishes the different forms of air by their heat and cold, etc.; but there can be no question that the basic difference between things is in their density.83 The grouping of philosophers that Theophrastus has taken from the Metaphysics has here resulted in a serious misrepresentation of doc- trine. Aristotle is convinced that the material monists did not - and could not - answer the problem of efficient causality, and he makes no distinction between the early and late monists in this regard.84 Thus, Diogenes is represented as differing from Anaximenes only in being after him in time. Aristotle asserts, further, that it is un- likely that one of the elements is the cause of the goodness in things or that the materialists should think that it is.85 Now, the doctrine that Aristotle here rejects as inconceivable is precisely that main- tained by Diogenes. He introduces Intelligence as the cause of motion and of the best possible order in the world, and this Intelligence is a form of air.86 It must have been as obvious to Diogenes as it was to Aristotle that material monism was no longer tenable if it failed to cope with efficient causality. Diogenes attempted to preserve the earlier doctrine by incorporating in it later notions about the cause of both motion and order. Aristotle's suppression of this part of Diog- enes' doctrine, in complete disregard for Diogenes' clear statements, is a criticism based on his own presuppositions about the final-efficient cause. The offhand manner in which he rules out even the possibility that the cause of goodness should be material is intended to dispose of doctrines like that of Diogenes as being not worth further comment. His silence about Intelligence falsifies Diogenes' doctrine, but his motive is clear. Theophrastus acknowledges Diogenes' connection with the late physicists by saying that Diogenes wrote for the most part in an eclectic manner and agreed in some points with Anaxagoras I05</page><page sequence="22">John B. McDiarmid and in others with Leucippus.87 By the reference to Anaxagoras is probably meant, among other things, Diogenes' adoption of Intel- ligence as the final-efficient cause, but Theophrastus does not, like Aristotle, give any reason for excluding this cause from his account. EMPEDOCLES According to Theophrastus, the material principles of Empedocles are four - fire, air, water, and earth -, which are eternal but change in number owing to aggregation and segregation.88 The principles in the strict sense, those by which the four elements are moved, are Love and Strife; for, as Empedocles held, the elements must be continually in alternate motion, being at one time aggregated by the force of Love and at another time segregated by the force of Strife. Theophrastus quotes from Empedocles: "at one time all uniting in one through Love, at another being borne apart by the repulsion of Strife." 89 This quotation, we must suppose, is the authority for Theophrastus' report. If Theophrastus has consulted the works of Empedocles, he has done so, apparently, only to find support for the interpretation of Aristotle; for his account is in all essentials the same as the descrip- tions of Empedocles' material and efficient principles in Metaphysics A.90 Probably the verses that Theophrastus quotes were the basis for part of Aristotle's account. The only point at which he differs from Aristotle is in his assertion that the alternate motion caused by Love and Strife was continuous. The source for this is apparently the verse of Empedocles immediately preceding the verses quoted.91 In Meta- physics A Aristotle does not specify whether Empedocles held that motion is continuous or not; but in that context at least he would probably agree with Theophrastus, since the only distinction he makes there regarding motion is that the Eleatics denied it and the other Presocratics accepted its existence with or without stating a cause for it.92 Since Aristotle and Theophratus assume that Empedocles' prin- ciples can be adequately expressed in terms of the Peripatetic material and efficient causes, they treat the four elements as permanent, inert masses of substance that are in themselves incapable of motion and they treat Love and Strife as two immaterial, universal motors that act upon the elements. The degree to which Theophrastus has carried this identification of Empedocles with the Peripatetics is shown clearly by his designation of Love and Strife as the "principles in the strict sense"; 93 for this reflects the Peripatetic conviction that the form- Io6</page><page sequence="23">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes efficient cause is more a principle than matter is. Enough of Em- pedocles' work remains to allow a test of this interpretation. It is obvious from the fragment quoted by Theophrastus that the principles of Empedocles had certain resemblances to the Aristotelian material and efficient causes; but it is equally obvious from other fragments that there is no exact correspondence and that Empedocles did not define the nature and operation of his principles as precisely as this interpretation would suggest. And, while he says that Love aggregates and Strife segregates the elements, he also attributes to the elements certain motions of their own.94 From this it follows that the four roots are not inert matter, and Love and Strife are not the causes of all motion. In fact, the fragments indicate that Empedocles thought of Love and Strife chiefly, if not exclusively, as effecting the formation and dissolution of organic compounds.95 In the latter part of his account Theophrastus attempts to show that Empedocles was not consistent in his use of Love and Strife. Not only did Empedocles assign the efficient power to Strife and Love when he said, "at one time uniting in one through Love, at another being borne apart by the repulsion of Strife." 96 Sometimes he reduced Love and Strife to the level of the elements and thus posited six ele- ments; for he said, "And at one time it parted asunder so as to be many instead of one; -fire and water and earth and the mighty height of air and dread Strife, too, apart from these, everywhere of equal weight, and Love, in their midst, equal in length and breadth." 97 This passage of Theophrastus has been cited as evidence that The- ophrastus regards Love and Strife as no less material than the four elements and Empedocles himself so regarded them.98 That these two forces are never matter in the sense that the four elements are, is, how- ever, shown by their special functions and by the facts that they are seen only with the mind 9 and are never, in the fragments, referred to as constituents of any thing.100 Furthermore Theophrastus does not say simply that Love and Strife are elements; his objection is that sometimes they are like elements and sometimes they are not, i.e., that Empedocles treated them both as material and as immaterial. What Theophrastus means by calling them elements becomes clearer from related Aristotelian passages that probably influenced his criticism. In De Generatione Aristotle likewise attributes six elements to Em- pedocles,101 and once in the Metaphysics he distinguishes Empedocles' Love from Anaxagoras' Nous by calling the one an element and the other a principle.102 In the former passage he differentiates between the two efficient elements, Love and Strife, and the four material ele- I07</page><page sequence="24">John B. McDiarmid ments. The latter passage shows that his reason for calling Love and Strife elements rather than principles is not that he considers them to be of the same nature as the four elements but that they seem less immaterial than such efficient principles as Anaxagoras' Nous. In a further passage he objects that Empedocles made Love both an effi- cient and a material principle; 103 but this no more than the passages already mentioned is proof that he considers Love to be simply a ma- terial element. His argument depends solely on his conviction that the Sphere is a homogeneous compound and that Love, being part of it, must be material. The quotation given by Theophrastus indicates that he is following the same line of reasoning. The basis of his argu- ment is not so much the physical attributes of Love and Strife as the fact that these forces are listed along with the four elements as if all six were products of separation from the One. Theophrastus is mis- interpreting the verses he quotes; for, when the elements are com- pletely brought together by Love, Strife has withdrawn and is, there- fore, not part of the Sphere.104 Furthermore, although his criticism is right insofar as Love and Strife are not consistently treated as immaterial forces, they are certainly more nearly immaterial than material; for Empedocles held that all space is filled by the ele- ments,105 and Love and Strife operate on them not from without but from within as they do in living creatures.106 The part,of Theophrastus' report that is based on the Metaphysics reproduces Aristotle's interpretation accurately. But attention should be drawn to Aristotle's other comments made there and elsewhere. To be sure, in the Metaphysics he refers, as Theophrastus does, to the four roots as elements, but he also calls them "the so-called elements in the form of matter," and by this vague expression he signifies that the four roots do not accord exactly with his own concept of matter.107 He treats Love and Strife as efficient causes, but he places limits on the equation of them with his own efficient cause; for, while he grants that Empedocles had made greater use of these causes than Anax- agoras did, he objects that Empedocles still did not use them ade- quately or consistently.108 The interpretation that Theophrastus adopts from Metaphysics A is only one of several offered by Aristotle. Although in the Metaphysics Aristotle treats Empedocles as a material pluralist for whom apparent generation and destruction are merely the aggregation and segregation of four unchanging and distinct sub- stances, in another context he complains that Empedocles speaks both as a pluralist and as a monist.109 As a pluralist, he holds, Empedocles must distinguish between generation and alteration.110 When he io8</page><page sequence="25">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes makes Empedocles a monist, on the other hand, he treats the Sphere as a homogeneous substrate in which the contraries inhere poten- tially.111 On this view the Sphere, not the elements, is ultimate; and this Aristotle considers to have been Empedocles' belief, contrary to what Empedocles himself had said.112 He holds, too, that, although Empedocles did not express himself clearly, he meant that Love and Strife were also the causes of good and evil, i.e., final causes.113 Again, he treats Love and Strife not as causes at all but as the states of the world at the moments of complete aggregation and segrega- tion.114 In Metaphysics A he probably considers the operation of Love and Strife to be continuous; but in one passage of the De Caelo he makes Empedocles' cosmic cycle start with a precosmical unified body in a state of rest.115 This interpretation is clearly incorrect since it ignores the fact that during both the increase of Love and the in- crease of Strife both Love and Strife are active. What matters is not that some of these interpretations are in greater or less agreement with the fragments but that each of them has as much claim to being Aristotle's judgment as his interpretation in the Metaphysics has. A complete text of the Physical Opinions might reveal the same di- versity in Theophrastus' interpretations. For, although in his treat- ment of the principles he understands the activity of Love and Strife to be continuous, in the De Sensibus he assumes, as Aristotle does in the De Caelo, that only one force is active at one time and that during the period of Love only aggregation takes place.116 ANAXAGORAS AND ARCHELAUS Theophrastus says that Anaxagoras was the first to change the opinions about the principles by supplying "the missing cause" and that his material principles were infinite.117 He held that all the homoeomeries, such as water, fire, and gold, are ungenerated and indestructible and that apparent generation and destruction is due only to their aggregation and segregation. All things, he believed, are in all things, and a particular thing, such as gold, derives its character and name from the predominance of one thing in its composition; for he had declared that "in everything there is a portion of everything" and "each thing is and was most manifestly those things of which it has most in it." 118 Theophrastus makes the comment that this theory resembles that of Anaximander, since Anaximander, too, held that in the separation from the Infinite like particles are borne to like and that particles are not generated but are already present in the Infinite. IO9</page><page sequence="26">John B. McDiarmid The difference between the two theories is that Anaxagoras posited Nous as the cause of motion and generation. Thus viewed, The- ophrastus says, Anaxagoras' material principles would appear to be infinite, and the cause of motion and generation would be one. He adds, however, that if the mixture of Anaxagoras were understood as being one thing, indefinite in kind and size, it would appear that Anaxagoras' principles were two, the Infinite and Nous. Theophrastus remarks that this latter explanation is what Anaxagoras "would seem to mean." The quotations from Anaxagoras establish that Theophrastus has used at least part of the work on which he is reporting. But the inter- pretation that he gives is throughout influenced by Aristotle. The statement that Anaxagoras made Nous the cause of motion and gen- eration may, for example, have been derived from the text of Anax- agoras.119 But the statement that Anaxagoras first changed the opin- ions about causality by supplying "the missing cause" is an inter- pretative comment and criticism derived from the Metaphysics and is understandable only on the thesis developed there. If this state- ment is taken by itself, granted the identification of Nous as the missing cause, there is still no indication of what the whole is from which Nous has been missing. And, even if it be supposed that the whole is the four Aristotelian causes, there is still the difficulty that Theophrastus attributes efficient causality to Parmenides, whom he presumably knew to be earlier than Anaxagoras.120 In the Meta- physics Aristotle states how Anaxagoras changed the opinions about causes and in what sense the cause that he proposed could be said to fulfill a lack. Parmenides had, according to Aristotle, used fire as an efficient cause; but, since such causes as this and the other elements are inadequate to generate the world, men were compelled by the truth to seek "the next cause," for neither a material element nor chance could be the cause of the goodness and beauty in things. Anaxagoras, then, seemed like a sober man by comparison with the random talk of his predecessors when he declared that Nous is present throughout nature as the cause of order and arrangement, i.e., as the cause both of the goodness in things and of movement.121 This is undoubtedly what Theophrastus means, too; Anaxagoras was the first to glimpse the final-efficient cause as something that must by its very nature be other than the elements, by which Parmenides and other earlier think- ers like him had explained motion. It should be observed, however, that, although Aristotle praises Anaxagoras as the discoverer of the final-efficient cause, he reports a tradition that Hermotimus had ex- IIO</page><page sequence="27">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes pressed the same views earlier than Anaxagoras.122 And he goes on to say that one might suspect that the first to seek after such a cause was Hesiod or Parmenides or whoever first made Love a principle and that Empedocles treated both good and evil as principles.123 He promises that he will decide later how all these thinkers should be arranged with regard to the priority of their discovery.124 But he does not fulfill this promise, and Theophrastus has been content to accept his enthusiastic acclaim of Anaxagoras as proof that Anaxagoras was the first. The statement that Anaxagoras' material principles are infinite, ungenerated, and indestructible and that apparent generation and destruction are due only to their aggregation and segregation may likewise be supported by the fragments of Anaxagoras.125 But the wording follows closely the wording of the Metaphysics.126 Clear evidence that Theophrastus is borrowing from Aristotle is his refer- ence to the principles as "homoeomeries." This word does not occur in the fragments of Anaxagoras; it is Aristotle's translation into his own phraseology of Anaxagoras' "seeds," and it is a possible transla- tion because Anaxagoras included in his seeds substances such as flesh and bone which Aristotle calls by the general term "homoeomery." 127 The importance of the word in the present context is that Theophras- tus has followed Metaphysics A in giving fire and water as examples of the Anaxagorean homoeomeries. These examples are misleading both with regard to the place of the elements in Anaxagoras' philos- ophy and with regard to the opinion of Aristotle and Theophrastus on this question.128 Thus far, in presenting earlier notions of matter, when Theophrastus has referred to the elements as principles he has meant the maxima membra; and, for lack of warning to the contrary, it is to be assumed that he means the same thing when he speaks of the doctrine of Anaxagoras. Now, Anaxagoras undoubtedly did think that there were seeds of the Empedoclean elements as well as of other things; and, since the Aristotelian term "homoeomery" is used of the elements as well as of substances like flesh and bone, fire and water may be cited as examples that hold true for both the Aristotelian homoeomeries and the Anaxagorean seeds.'29 But Aristotle himself knows that the seeds of the elements are not the maxima membra, and in the De Caelo and the De Generatione he distinguishes Empedocles from Anaxagoras by the observation that for the former the elements, i.e., the maxima membra, were ultimate and for the latter they were compounds of the homoeomeries.130 And the fact that Theophrastus adds gold along with fire and water as an example of the homoeomeries III</page><page sequence="28">John B. McDiarmid is tacit recognition that these are not elements in the Empedoclean sense.131 This being so, it may be asked why fire and water, rather than some unambiguous substances like flesh and bone, are given as examples. The reason, although obscured by the patchwork form of Theophrastus' accounts, is clear in Aristotle's outline of the develop- ment of the material cause in the Metaphysics. Aristotle believes that all earlier theories of matter resembled his own and were an imperfect expression of it. The material principle toward which the earlier theories evolve is prime matter, and of this the simplest visible forms are the four simple bodies, which the early philosophers thought to be ultimate. The evolution of the material cause is, thus, the emerg- ence of first one, then another, then all four of the simple bodies. The earliest monists each posited one of these as his principle; Empedocles posited all four; and Anaxagoras made his principles infinite.132 The reference to fire and water as examples of Anaxagoras' principles is meant to show that he does not stand outside of the general evolu- tionary pattern; his material principles were of the same sort as those of his predecessors and differed only in being numerically infinite. For his assertion that all things are in all things and that a par- ticular thing such as gold derives its name and character from the predominance in it of one thing, Theophrastus has the evidence of the quotations that he makes from Anaxagoras.133 It does not follow, however, that he has made an independent evaluation of the evidence. Essentially the same description of the theory appears in Physics A in a passage that follows immediately after one that will presently be shown to have influenced the latter part of Theophrastus' account. Aristotle describes the theory thus: everything is mixed in everything; things appear different from one another and receive different names according to the numerical predominance of one of the infinite par- ticles in the mixture; nothing is purely and wholly white, black, sweet, flesh, or bone, but the nature of a thing is that of which it contains the most.134 This is clearly a paraphrase of the statements of Anax- agoras quoted by Theophrastus or of others similar to them. In this case, again, Theophrastus has apparently adopted the interpretation of Aristotle and has filled in what he thinks is the primary evidence for it. One notable feature of the present descriptions of both The- ophrastus and Aristotle is that the homoeomeries are no longer asso- ciated with the elements. The example used by Theophrastus is gold; and those of Aristotle are non-contrary things and contrary qualities such as might have been selected to prove the difference between the homoeomeries and the elements. 112</page><page sequence="29">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes In the fuller exposition of Anaxagoras' theory to which Theophras- tus proceeds in the latter part of his account, he returns to the view implicit in his reference to fire and water as homoeomeries, and he tries to show that Anaxagoras shared the presuppositions on which the theory of the four simple bodies is premised.135 This is the significance of his remark that the material cause of Anaxagoras is the same as that of Anaximander and may be treated either as plural or single. He says that Anaxagoras "would seem to mean" that it is single, and from this it may be inferred that he knows that Anaxagoras did not actually say anything of the sort. His authority is now not the text of Anaxagoras but the interpretation set forth in the passage of Physics A preceding that referred to above.136 This interpretation has been discussed in the section on Anaximander, but it should be re- viewed here. Aristotle sets Anaxagoras, Anaximander, and Empedocles apart from those philosophers whose material principle is one, on the ground that for these three things are both one and many and genera- tion is separation from the One of the pre-existent contraries. He knows that for all three the material cause principles are plural. His motive for reducing their principles to a unity is that he wishes to prove that these philosophers had a material principle that resembled his own prime matter. A similar motive is evident in a passage of Metaphysics A in which again the material principles of Anaxagoras are shown to be a unity.'37 This latter passage is probably the im- mediate source of Theophrastus' remark that Anaxagoras "would seem to mean" a single thing by his material cause. In this instance Aristotle is trying to identify Nous and the homoeomeries with his pair of causes, form and matter. He says that, "if it were assumed that Anaxagoras posited two elements, the supposition would be thor- oughly in accord with an argument which Anaxagoras did not state but which he would have accepted if anyone had led him to it." 138 As Aristotle admits, he is not stating Anaxagoras' doctrine but is giving it a logical development that Anaxagoras had neglected. At the beginning of his report Theophrastus, following Metaphysics A, has said that Anaxagoras explained apparent generation and de- struction by aggregation and segregation, and later he has explicitly attributed this theory to him again.139 But the consequence of the view that Anaxagoras' mixture is a single indeterminate thing is that this mechanism is no longer suitable, since every particle of the mix- ture will be identical with every other. Theophrastus does not say what he now conceives the generative process to be. But, in the open- ing sentence of the passage in which this account occurs, Simplicius II3</page><page sequence="30">John B. McDiarmid says that the principles of Anaxagoras are contrary; and, whether or not Simplicius is quoting from Theophrastus, this is undoubtedly how Theophrastus understands the homoeomeries, since contrariety is an essential part of Aristotle's interpretation of the mixture as a single thing.140 Aristotle states what the contrariety means for Anaxagoras' theory of generation and distinction: the genesis of a specific thing is qualitative change.141 Thus, the homoeomeries are not physical in- gredients of infinite variety, but contrary forces inherent in the mix- ture; and separation from the mixture is not a mechanical process but the actualization of the inherent contraries. What had started as a correctly and clearly stated doctrine of "like to like," in evidence of which Theophrastus produced Anaxagoras' own words, has now turned out to be a doctrine involving the specifically Aristotelian concept of contrariety.142 With regard to the nature of the error of attributing this sort of contrariety to the Presocratics no more need be said. This instance is, however, particularly interesting, because both Aristotle and The- ophrastus admit that their interpretation is possible only on the as- sumption that Anaxagoras did not understand or mean what he said. It shows, too, how far Theophrastus is prepared to go in accepting Aristotle's interpretations against the known facts of the doctrine interpreted. Further, the contradiction between this interpretation and the first one taken from Metaphysics A demonstrates again how Theophrastus can combine two or more of Aristotle's accounts with- out, apparently, being aware that they are made from fundamentally different points of view. After his account of Anaxagoras, Theophrastus makes brief ref- erence to Archelaus the Athenian.143 He says that Archelaus was the student of Anaxagoras and, while trying to be original in cosmogony and other matters, made his principles the same as those of Anax- agoras. Aristotle does not refer to Archelaus by name in any extant work, nor does he refer in Metaphysics A to any follower of Anaxagoras who might be identified as Archelaus. Theophrastus' purpose is, evidently, to supplement Aristotle's account by naming a later philosopher whose doctrine would stand in somewhat the same relationship to that of Anaxagoras as Aristotle supposes the doctrines of Hippo, Diogenes, and Heraclitus stood to those of Thales, Anax- imenes, and Hippasus. The inexactness of the parallels between the principles of the earlier and later monists vouches little for Theophrastus' statement that Archelaus made his principles the same as those of Anaxagoras. The II4</page><page sequence="31">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes doxographers agree that Archelaus posited Nous as the efficient cause.144 But on his material cause they are divided, some saying that he posited an infinite number of dissimilar bodies from which things are produced by mechanical combination and separation,145 and others that he posited infinite air which is subject to rarefaction and con- densation.146 Since these reports of the material principle are ap- parently both derived from the Physical Opinions, the latter one can therefore not be rejected simply on the ground that it disagrees with the statement quoted by Simplicius. No conclusive explanation of this disagreement can be offered, but the problem should be con- sidered because it may suggest the origin of other such disagreements in the doxography. It is proposed that the report that the material principle consists of infinite dissimilar bodies is an unjustified exten- sion of Theophrastus' statement, and that this report is due to unawareness of the limits placed on Theophrastus' comparisons by his use of the Metaphysics summary. Aristotle arranges principles by their functions as matter, source of motion, form, and end; and principles with the same functions are essentially the same and are distinguished secondarily by their number rather than by their specific character. Hence, Aristotle sums up his discussion of the material and efficient causes with the statement that those who posited only the material cause made it either one or more than one, and those who added an efficient cause similarly declared it to be single or twofold.147 In Metaphysics A, Aristotle classes Anaxagoras with those who posited a plurality of material principles, but both he and Theophrastus favor the interpretation according to which Anaxagoras' matter is a single principle. On this interpretation Anaxagoras would fall in the class of those who posited a single material cause and a single efficient cause. If Archelaus' principles were air and Nous, he would fall in the same class; and within that class he would be most closely related to Anaxagoras because his efficient cause, being Nous rather than one of the elements, is the cause not only of motion but also of goodness and beauty in the universe. If this explanation is correct, the chief point of similarity is the Nous; and the similarity of the material principles is of secondary importance and depends on the Aristotelian view that Anaxagoras' mixture is a single body. XENOPHANES Simplicius' passage on Xenophanes consists of three elements: 148 the opening sentences, in one of which Theophrastus is referred to by II5</page><page sequence="32">John B. McDiarmid name and which may therefore be considered to be a quotation from or a paraphrase of the Physical Opinions; material derived from the late Peripatetic treatise De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia; 149 and a polemic against Nicolaus, who held that Xenophanes' principle was im- movable and infinite, and Alexander, who held that it was immovable, finite, and spheroid. Interspersed in the passage are quotations from Xenophanes' poetry, which are probably derived from Theophrastus through Alexander. Simplicius begins his comments on Xenophanes with the statement that if the single principle of the monists is immovable it must be either infinite or finite as is held respectively by Melissus and Parmen- ides, who speak not of a material element but of a true being.150 He says that, according to Theophrastus, Xenophanes, who was the teacher of Parmenides, asserted that the principle is one (i.e., that being, or the Universe, is one) but that it is neither finite nor infinite, neither in motion nor at rest. Notice of this doctrine, Theophrastus agrees, is appropriate to some investigation other than physics; for Xenophanes said that this One, or Universe, is the God.15' With this passage should be compared Aristotle's remarks on the Eleatics in the Metaphysics.12 He says that their views vary both in the excellence of their statement and in their conformity to nature. The discussion of them does not fit the present investigation into causes, because, unlike some physicists who generate the universe from their one principle, they say that the universe is immovable. This much is, however, appropriate to the present inquiry: Parmenides seems to fasten on what is one in definition, Melissus on what is one in material, and the former therefore says it is finite, the latter that it is infinite; while Xenophanes, who was the first of the partisans of the One and whose pupil Parmenides is said to have been, gave no clear statement and seems not to have grasped the nature of either of these causes, but with reference to the whole universe he says the One is God. Aristotle concludes that Xenophanes and MIelissus must be omitted from the present inquiry because they are a little too naive. The agreement between these two passages as to the connection of Xenophanes with Parmenides, Xenophanes' doctrine that the One is God, and the unsuitability of the Eleatic doctrine to the discussion of physical causes, is sufficient to indicate that Theophrastus has derived his account from that of Aristotle. There are, however, two essential differences. Theophrastus says that the One of Xenophanes is neither in motion nor at rest; Aristotle says that the universe of the Eleatics is immobile. Theophrastus says that the One of Xenophanes II6</page><page sequence="33">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes is neither infinite nor finite; Aristotle says that Xenophanes posited neither the One of Parmenides, which is one in definition and finite, nor the One of Melissus, which is material and infinite. If, therefore, Theophrastus has taken his account from Aristotle's, it is evident that he has misunderstood Aristotle's meaning. The distinction that Aristotle is making between Parmenides and Melissus is that the principle of the former was apparently conceptual and of the latter, material; the distinction between their principles as to being finite and infinite is introduced only parenthetically as what Aristotle believes to be a consequence of the former distinction.1'3 Hence, when Aristotle says that Xenophanes seems to have grasped neither of these causes, he means, not that Xenophanes had declared the One to be neither finite nor infinite, but that he had apparently failed to grasp either the formal or material aspect of the One. Secondly, Aristotle is not giving a positive description of Xenophanes' doctrine; he is admitting his own lack of evidence for classing Xenophanes with either Parmenides or Melissus. Xenophanes had, according to Aristotle, simply said that the One is God. Being unable to decide with which of the four causes the One is to be ranked, Aristotle con- cludes that whatever Xenophanes meant it was something different from the doctrines of Parmenides and Melissus. What amounts to a confession of ignorance is, then, apparently converted by Theo- phrastus into a definite statement that Xenophanes denied the spatial attributes that Parmenides and Melissus had ascribed to their One.'54 That Theophrastus should have so misunderstood Aristotle would be surprising. Further consideration will show, however, that he probably did not. The interpretation of Alexander against which Simplicius is citing Theophrastus, that the One is finite and immobile, is attested by several doxographers who stand in different lines of the transmission from the Physical Opinions and is, therefore, almost certainly that of Theophrastus himself.155 The conclusion must be, then, that Theophrastus has contradicted himself, or that either Simplicius or Alexander has misrepresented Theophrastus' account. The evidence points to Simplicius. Part of his account is certainly derived from the De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia. In this treatise it is stated that Xenophanes held the One to be neither in motion nor at rest and neither finite nor infinite.156 It would appear that the treatise was the source of Simplicius' statement to the same effect and that Simplicius had confused the account given in the treatise with that of Theophrastus. For the statement that Xenophanes denied both motion and rest there can hardly be any other explanation; it II7</page><page sequence="34">John B. McDiarmid is inconceivable, quite apart from the evidence of the doxographers, that Theophrastus should consider Xenophanes an Eleatic and yet state that Xenophanes had denied one of the fundamental tenets of the Eleatics, the immobility of being. But, if this is Simplicius' addition, it does not follow that there was nothing in Theophrastus to correspond to his statement that the One of Xenophanes is neither finite nor infinite.157 It must be imagined that there was some point of contact between the De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia and the account of Theophrastus that led Simplicius to believe the interpretations identical. The simplest explanation is offered by the supposition that, in Theophrastus' account, as in Aristotle's, the distinction as to whether the One is finite or infinite applied not to Xenophanes but only secondarily to the distinction between the conceptual principle of Parmenides and the material principle of Melissus, and that Xenoph- anes had been distinguished from the other Eleatics by his failure to specify whether his principle was conceptual or material. If this had been the case, Simplicius' confusion might be understandable. In the part of his commentary in which this interpretation occurs, he is asking only whether the principle is finite or infinite, in motion or at rest. His concern with the question at hand might well cause him to mistake the basis on which the Eleatics are being compared and so to overlook the fundamental difference between Theophrastus and the De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia. The original statement, "Xenoph- anes does not say whether the One is conceptual (and finite) like that of Parmenides or material (and infinite) like that of Melissus," would then become, "Xenophanes says that his One is neither finite like that of Parmenides nor infinite like that of Melissus." Having made the two accounts square in this way, Simplicius would naturally conclude that they were identical and that Alexander's further quota- tions from Theophrastus to the effect that the One of Xenophanes is spheroid, limited and immobile must be in error because irreconcilable with the De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia.58s More important than the exact details of Theophrastus' account is the fact that he has included Xenophanes in the Physical Opinions at all. Aristotle speaks of Xenophanes' principle without confidence and acknowledges that Xenophanes has no place in the history of causality. His only reason for mentioning Xenophanes appears to be that he is hesitant to omit him in view of Plato's statement in The Sophist that the Eleatic sect began with Xenophanes or still earlier.159 There is no more justification for treating this statement as historical than there is for so treating the doctrinal connection that II8</page><page sequence="35">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes Plato suggests between the Heracliteans and Homer.160 Nevertheless, Aristotle not only concludes that Xenophanes was a true Eleatic; but, by ignoring Plato's qualification that the Eleatic sect may have begun still earlier, he makes Xenophanes the founder of the school; and he apparently assumes that, since Parmenides was the earliest of the other known Eleatics, he was the pupil of Xenophanes. Aristotle's uncertainty about the supposed relationship of Xenophanes and Parmenides is revealed by his reference to it as hearsay. In Theo- phrastus and the doxographers, however, hearsay becomes a fact; and to complete the Eleatic line of descent Theophrastus adds that Xenophanes was the pupil of Anaximander - apparently on no other grounds than Aristotle's questionable supposition that the Eleatic doctrine was an outgrowth of and a reaction against the Ionian monism.16l Plato's reason for linking Xenophanes with the Eleatics must have been something in the poems that seemed to foreshadow an essential feature of the Eleatic doctrine-perhaps such lines as those in which Xenophanes says, "God ever abideth in the selfsame place, moving not at all, etc." 162 Theophrastus at least seems to have taken these lines as proof of the immobility of the One.163 From the other fragments of Xenophanes, however, it appears more likely that these lines are part of an attack on the current anthropomorphic poly- theism than a philosophical denial of change.1"4 He says that God is one; 165 but it is quite clear from the rest of the fragment in which this sentence occurs that he does not mean that the One is God, as Aristotle and Theophrastus assert, although it is conceivable that the sentence might be twisted to give this sense if one were convinced beforehand that he was an Eleatic. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the fragments that, as Aristotle and Theophrastus say, he identified God with the world 1G;l nor, on the other hand, that he believed that God is real and the phenomenal world is not. God is said to be in supreme control of the world,167 but the plurality and change of the phenomenal world are apparently recognized as no less real.168 Admittedly, the fewness of the extant fragments and the doubts as to their context in the poems as a whole make their evidence inconclusive. But if Aristotle had any more conclusive evidence, it is difficult to explain the non-committal tone of his remarks; and the accounts of the doxographers do not suggest that Theophrastus had made use of much more than the fragments now available.l'9 The systematic treatment in the doxography is apparently due only to Theophrastus' acceptance of Aristotle's evaluation of the Sophist passage and to his II9</page><page sequence="36">John B. McDiarmid subsequent attempt to fill in the details from Xenophanes' poems. Ultimately, then, Xenophanes, the Eleatic of the doxographers, has no apparent basis but a passing remark of Plato. PARMENIDES Theophrastus' account of Parmenides is to be reconstructed from quotations by Alexander, Simplicius, and Diogenes Laertius.170 It is as follows. The philosophy of Parmenides took two different direc- tions, the Way of Truth and the Way of Opinion.171 According to the Way of Truth, the universe is one, ungenerated, eternal, limited, and spherical.172 Parmenides proved the unity of the whole by this reasoning: That which is besides the existent is non-existent; the non-existent is nothing; therefore the existent is one.173 To explain the generation of phenomena in accordance with the opinion of the many, however, Parmenides posited fire and earth as the efficient cause and material cause, and he said that from the warm and the cold all things are created.174 This is a paraphrase and conflation of elements from two passages in the Metaphysics. In the first, Aristotle asserts that the Eleatics, unlike the Ionians, recognized the necessity of an efficient cause to explain motion and that, since they failed to discover this cause, they declared that the unity of being is motionless and denied not only generation and destruction but all change.175 Among them, he believes, Parmenides alone might be said to have been aware of the efficient cause, and he only inasmuch as he employed in a sense two causes. Recognition of the efficient cause is easier, Aristotle believes, for those who employ more than one principle, e.g., warm and cold, or fire and earth; for they treat fire as the source of movement and the other primary bodies as that which is moved. In the following chapter he repeats that, while the physicists generated the universe from their one principle, the Eleatics asserted that being is motion- less.176 He says that Parmenides seems to have grasped that which is one in definition and therefore said that it is limited. Parmenides had reasoned that, since there is no non-existent, being is one and nothing else is. But, being constrained to follow the phenomena and holding that while only the One exists according to definition many things exist according to sensation, he set up two causes, fire and earth, the former of which he ranked with being and the latter with non-being. The similarities between the accounts of Theophrastus and Aris- 120</page><page sequence="37">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes totle are so obvious as to require no comment. The interpretation given of Parmenides makes him not only a monist who, because of his denial of motion, cannot be properly included in the history of causality,177 but also a material pluralist who had anticipated the Peripatetic material and efficient causes. The treatment of him as a monist is substantiated by the fragments from the first part of his poem. The treatment of him as a pluralist is based on the supposition that the second part of his poem is as much a presentation of his own views as the first is. This supposition is incorrect; for, at the beginning of the second part, he warns that he has come to the end of his trustworthy speech and thought about the truth, and that henceforth he will give the beliefs of mortals in the deceptive ordering of his words.178 Furthermore, the principles that Parmenides speaks of in the second part of the poem are not fire and earth, but "the heavenly fire of flame" and "dark night." 179 The identification of night with earth is due to Aristotle's attempt--with complete disregard for Parmenides' words- to find qualitative contrariety in Parmenides by making his supposed principles square with the two limiting terms of the four simple bodies.180 In order that Parmenides may be treated within the Peripatetic scheme of causality, it is assumed that of the two contrary principles the one must be material and the other efficient. The decision that fire is the active principle rests on the assumption that what Parmenides really meant was the Peripatetic warm; from this it follows that the other principle must be passive. There is nothing in Parmenides' poem to justify this interpretation. He does not say which of the principles is active and which passive, nor does he give any indication that he thinks heat to be the exclusive characteristic of fire and cold of night. Although Theophrastus accepts Aristotle's interpretation of Par- menides' poem as regards the identification of fire and earth with the efficient and material causes, he himself gives evidence against this interpretation. Aristotle says that Parmenides set up fire and earth as causes because he was constrained to follow the phenomena. Theophrastus, on the other hand, says that Parmenides' aim was to explain the generation of phenomena according to the opinion of the multitude; and the care with which he distinguishes the two parts of the poem shows clearly that he is aware that the second part of the poem does not represent Parmenides' orthodox doctrine.181 The fact that he nevertheless, like Aristotle, includes the second part of the poem in his historical treatment of Parmenides reveals how much he is disposed to follow the pattern of Aristotle's accounts even when, 121</page><page sequence="38">John B. McDiarmid as here, he appears to know that Aristotle's interpretation is con- trary to the Presocratic writings. In the De Sensibus he disregards the distinction he has made here between the two parts of the poem and derives his report of Parmenides' psychology from the Way of Opinion without giving a hint that the views he is stating are not Parmenides' own.182 By his practice of excerpting particular passages from Aristotle, Theophrastus has here again, through the doxographers, given cur- rency to an interpretation that rests on the sole authority of Aristotle but is at the same time only one of several interpretations made by Aristotle. Not only does Aristotle identify fire and night with the efficient and material causes; even in one of the passages from which Theophrastus has borrowed he places in opposition to fire not earth alone but also water and the other simple bodies,l83 and he associates fire with being, and earth with non-being.184 In another passage, in which he is seeking to establish Hesiod and Parmenides as fore- runners of Empedocles, he equates Love, not fire, with the efficient cause.'85 The same variation is found in the treatment of Parmenides' One. Theophrastus evidently takes the One to be corporeal.186 The corporeality of the One is certainly implied by Aristotle's attempt in Metaphysics A to establish a historical relationship between the Eleatics and the Ionian monists.'7 Elsewhere he states explicitly that neither Parmenides nor nMelissus believed that anything exists apart from sensible substance.'88 But the very fact that he accepts the second part of the poem as a statement of Parmenides' own doctrine shows in itself that he thinks the first part is not physical in the same sense as the second; and when he distinguishes Parmenides from Melissus he says that the former seems to have held that the One is conceptual, and the latter that it is material.'89 This divergence in his accounts suggests strongly that it is not clear to him from Parmenides' writings what the nature of the One is.190 The first interpretation might seem to be justified by the concrete language used by Par- menides of the One,'91 and the second might in part be prompted by the suspicion that the description of the One is purely metaphorical. Ultimately, however, the first interpretation rests on the assumption that the Eleatic doctrine must have been a correction of Ionian monism in the direction of his own system; the second is only his con- clusion of what he thinks must logically have been the distinction between Parmenides and Melissus. Neither of his interpretations, therefore, is decisive evidence one way or the other; and what has already been noticed of Theophrastus' technique of compilation does 122</page><page sequence="39">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes not support the belief that his choice of the one interpretation gives to that interpretation any greater authority. THE ATOMISTS Theophrastus reports that Leucippus, according to two different traditions, was said to be an Eleatic and a Milesian, and that he shared the philosophy of Parmenides but took the opposite direction to Parmenides and Xenophanes in his explanation of things.192 They maintained that the All is one, indivisible, uncreated, and finite, and they agreed not even to investigate non-being; but he posited as elements the atoms, which he believed to be in constant motion and innumerable. He made the shapes infinite in number because he thought there was no reason why they should be of one sort rather than of another and because he observed that generation and change are unceasing. He held, further, that being is no more real than non-being but that both are causes in the generation of things; for, supposing the substance of the atoms to be compact and full, he called them being, and he said that they are moved in the void, which he called non-being. At this point Theophrastus interrupts his account to say that in like manner Leucippus' associate, Democritus, made his principles the full and the void, calling the one being and the other non-being. Positing the atoms as material, he and Leucippus generated other things by the differences of the atoms. These differ- ences they thought to be three - rhythm, intercontact, and turning, i.e., shape, order, and position.193 Theophrastus now returns to the main line of his account with a statement intended to explain the movement of the atoms in the void. Leucippus and Democritus, he says, held that like is naturally moved by like, that things akin are borne to each other, and that when each shape is inserted into a new aggregation it produces a different arrangement. Thus, by their infinite principles, Leucippus and Democritus professed that they alone could give a reasonable explanation of all modifications and substances, as well as of the cause and manner of generation. It will be seen that Theophrastus' digression on the similarity between the doctrines of Leucippus and DemoCritus closely follows Aristotle's brief report of atomism in Metaphysics A.194 Aristotle says that Leucippus and his associate, Democritus, made their principles the full and the void, calling the one being and the other non-being.'95 As the monists generated all other things by modification of their principle by the rare and the dense, so these two said that 123</page><page sequence="40">differences in matter are the causes of other things. These differences, they thought, are rhythm, intercontact, and turning, i.e., shape, order, and position.196 Aristotle ends by saying that, like the others (i.e., the monists), Leucippus and Democritus neglected the cause and manner of motion. This is undoubtedly what Theophrastus means by saying that they believed that like is naturally moved by like; that is the atomists did not supply a separate cause of motion but, like the Milesians, they simply made motion a property of matter.197 With the main body of Theophrastus' account should be compared the passage of the De Generatione in which Aristotle gives what he supposes to have been the antecedents of atomism.198 Aristotle says that some of the ancients believed that being must be one and motionless on the grounds that the void is non-being and that, with- out the void, motion and plurality would be impossible.199 The same objection, they asserted, held true not only against the theory that there are many and a void but also against the theory that the universe is discretes-in-contact; for on the latter theory, if the universe is divisible throughout, there is no one and no many but only a void, and at the same time there can be no motion. Reasoning this way they were led to transcend sense-perception and to disregard it on the belief that one should follow the argument.200 Leucippus, however, thought that he had a theory that harmonized with sense-perception and would not abolish generation and destruction, motion, or plu- rality; and he made these concessions to phenomena.201 He conceded that motion is impossible without a void and that the void is non- being; but he held that the full is not one but is composed of units which are infinite in number and are indivisible because of their minuteness. He said that the void exists and that the many move in it.202 Generation and destruction he believed to be due to the aggrega- tion and segregation of the many (i.e., the atoms), action and passion occurring wherever the many are in contact and generation being caused by their being put together and becoming intertwined.203 In these two passages Aristotle is considering atomism from two entirely different points of view and he gives two different representa- tions of the theory. The result is that, by inserting the report derived from the Metaphysics into that derived from the De Generatione, Theophrastus has made his account self-contradictory. According to the interpretation taken from the Metaphysics, the atoms are dis- tinguished by shape, order, and position; 204 in that taken from the De Generatione, shape alone is emphasized as if it were the sole distinguishing characteristic of the atoms, and the word "shape" is John B. McDiarmid I24</page><page sequence="41">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes used as if it were equivalent to "atom." 205 In the account of the Metaphysics, all change is said to be due to the differentiation of the material substrate; and, by saying that the atomists substituted shape, order, and position for the rare and dense, Aristotle suggests that the atomists' mechanism of change in some way involved the interaction of contraries.206 Theophrastus repeats this interpretation, but in his very next sentence-now under the influence of the De Generatione - he says that the atomists believed that interaction occurs between similars and that both substantial and qualitative change result from a mechanical reordering of the atoms in the void.207 The conflation by Theophrastus of Aristotle's two accounts has had other more serious consequences for the history of atomism. In the opening statement Theophrastus has said that Leucippus was reported to be an Eleatic and a Milesian and that he shared the philosophy of Parmenides. This statement, along with doxographical testimonia to the effect that Leucippus was an Abderite and the student of Zeno,208 has been used to reconstruct not only Leucippus' own biography but also the personal and doctrinal connections between the schools of the Milesians, Eleatics, and atomists.29 Lest it be objected that Theo- phrastus is merely reporting well-known facts, it may be pointed out that Aristotle appears to know nothing of Leucippus' life except that Democritus the Abderite was his associate. Nor does Aristotle appear to know in what way the doctrine of Leucippus was related to that of Democritus or was like or unlike it; he identifies the two men to such an extent that he attributes the same doctrine now to both, now to one alone, and now to the other.210 This identification has un- doubtedly led the doxographers to infer that Leucippus was, like Democritus, an Abderite. The other biographical data reported by Theophrastus and the doxographers have been derived in the same way. Theophrastus says that Leucippus "shared" the philosophy of Parmenides; but he proceeds to a statement of the differences between Leucippus and the Eleatics that would make it appear that Leucippus not only did not share any of Parmenides' philosophy but had in fact been utterly opposed to it. The De Generatione passage from which he has borrowed indicates what Theophrastus means by "shared." He is referring to what Aristotle conceives to have been the starting-point of the atomists, namely, Leucippus' acceptance of the Eleatic axioms that there can be no motion or plurality without a void and that the void is non-being. Aristotle does not mention any of the Eleatics by name. It is certain, however, that the axioms I25</page><page sequence="42">John B. McDiarmid referred to are those of Parmenides,211 and the application of these axioms against a universe composed of discretes-in-contact is ap- parently the attack of Zeno on Empedocles' restatement of the material pluralism that Parmenides had sought to refute.212 Insofar, then, as Leucippus accepted these axioms, he might be said to have shared the philosophy of Parmenides, as well as of Zeno, and he might be said to be in the Eleatic tradition. However, Aristotle also represents Leucippus as attempting to reconcile Eleatic logic with the plurality and change of the phenomenal world and, in Metaphysics A, classes him with the Milesian monists, who took motion for granted without troubling to explain it.213 Leucippus might also, therefore, be said to have shared the philosophy of the physicists. In one fragment Theophrastus makes more explicit the connection that Aristotle believes to have existed between the doctrines of the Milesians and atomists.214 He says that Democritus advanced his theory of the atoms because he thought the explanations based on the warm, cold, etc., were crude. By this interpretation the atomists are represented as accepting and correcting the physics of the Milesians as they had the logic of the Eleatics. Thus, with regard to the sup- positions that Aristotle makes about the background of atomism in his two accounts, Leucippus might be said to be both an Eleatic and a Milesian. There need be no other basis for such a statement than the two Aristotelian passages noted. Theophrastus- or Simplicius and the other doxographers - apparently concluded that relationship of doctrine implied identity of birthplace, and that Leucippus not only owed part of his doctrine to Parmenides and Zeno but was also a pupil in the supposed Eleatic school. There is nothing in the Aristo- telian passages to support these conclusions. Aristotle does not suggest that Leucippus was an Eleatic or Milesian by birth nor even that Leucippus had personal contact with any of the Eleatics. If he had been able to bolster his argument for the doctrinal connection between Leucippus and the Eleatics by reference to known facts of Leucippus' life, he would probably have done so. But, even if by his double reference to Leucippus as an Eleatic and as a Milesian, Theophrastus intends to refer only to the doctrinal connections suggested by Aristotle, the historical validity of these connections is dubious. That the atomists were influenced by the Eleatics and attempted to answer the objections raised by them is beyond question. The impression given by Aristotle in the De Genera- tione and by Theophrastus in the part of his account derived from that work is, however, that the atomists considered the assertion of I26</page><page sequence="43">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes the void's existence to be sufficient answer. Clearly it was not, and the atomists can hardly have thought that it was. When Melissus restated Parmenides' doctrine against Empedocles and Anaxagoras, he proved not only that the void is non-being but also that the initiation of movement by such forces as these philosophers had postulated is impossible.215 To save phenomenal change, therefore, the atomists had also to assert that movement has no beginning but is eternal. Both Aristotle and Theophrastus appear to think that Leucippus did make this assertion.216 But in the passages discussed here they gloss over this essential feature of Leucippus' doctrine as if it were due to his failure to supply efficient causality rather than to his attempt to defend himself against one of the main attacks to which Empedocles and Anaxagoras had been susceptible. Furthermore, they do not notice that it was not Parmenides or Zeno but Melissus who, while showing the impossibility of such a pluralism as Anaxagoras', had at the same time shown how a plurality could be made consistent with Eleatic logic. He argued that, if there are to be many things, each of them must have the same characteristics as the Eleatic One.217 It was just this requirement that the atoms of Leucippus were intended to meet. But Aristotle and Theophrastus so underestimate the in- fluence of Melissus on atomism, that Aristotle dismisses him with the comment that "some" believed the All to be infinite,218 and Theo- phrastus makes no reference to him at all. Theophrastus says that the All of Parmenides is one, ungenerated, and finite, while Leucippus declared the atoms to be infinite and in continual movement and observed that change and generation is unceasing.219 Theophrastus' purpose is to find as complete opposition as possible between the atoms and the Eleatic One, and to do this he must exclude the One of Melissus because it, like the atoms, is infinite. It will be noted, too, that, in so opposing the atomists to the Eleatics, Theophrastus ob- scures what was in fact a main point of agreement between the two groups; although they held opposed views regarding phenomenal change, they agreed that the principles are incapable of change. Whatever connection the atomistic doctrine may have had with the Milesian on the other hand, it is at least clear that the connection made by Aristotle is due to his belief that, since the atomists had not provided a source of motion comparable to his efficient cause, they must, like the Milesians, have failed altogether to account for motion. It is patently incorrect to imply that the atomists had ignored the question of movement and that by rejecting such forces as Anax- agoras' Nous they were simply returning to the Milesian view; and it I27</page><page sequence="44">John B. McDiarmid is equally incorrect to imply that, since they had neglected all the causes but the material, their explanation of change must be essentially the same as that of the Milesians. Finally, the other reports of Theophrastus and Aristotle should be reviewed briefly in relation to those discussed above. It has been seen that in the Metaphysics account the atoms are distinguished by shape, order, and position and in the De Generatione, by shape alone. In the De Sensibus, however, Theophrastus recognizes, as Aristotle does in the Physics and elsewhere, that the atoms are also distinguished by size.220 The interpretation taken from the Metaphysics presupposes that change in some way involves contrariety, and, according to that of the De Generatione, change is due to the interaction of similars. But, having thus committed himself so positively on both sides of the question, in the first sentence of his account of Democritus' psycho- logical theory in the De Sensibus, Theophrastus says that Democritus did not make it clear whether sense perception is due to the inter- action of contraries or similars.221 This avowal of ignorance is com- ment enough on the definiteness with which both conflicting notions are attributed to atomists in the Physical Opinions fragment. That Democritus did not specifically answer the question asked by Theo- phrastus in the De Sensibus is undoubtedly true; it would simply not occur to him to do so, since in his time all interaction was thought to be between similars. In his closer examination of Democritus in the De Sensibus, Theophrastus appears to recognize this fact when he attributes to Democritus the theory that like things best know like; 222 but even then he is so predisposed to interpret Democritus in terms of the Peripatetic theory of sense perception that he cannot refrain from suggesting that Democritus subscribed to the same notion.223 Lastly, although in both the Metaphysics and De Genera- tione interpretations all change is made to result from a single process, in another passage Aristotle claims to find in the atomists the dis- tinction between substantial and qualitative change.224 He says that generation and destruction are due to the aggregation and separation of the atoms and that alteration is due to order and position. Theophrastus appends to his report of Leucippus and Democritus a brief account of Metrodorus the Chian. He says that, although Metrodorus pursued his own inquiry in other matters, he made his principles practically the same as those of Democritus and his associates; he set up as first causes the full and void, i.e., being and non-being.225 Aristotle does not mention AIetrodorus by name; nor is there enough evidence, apart from the Theophrastean doxography, 128</page><page sequence="45">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes to determine the exact relationship of his atomic theory to that of Democritus. Theophrastus has introduced Metrodorus as a later representative of the atomistic theory, and he has applied to him the account given of Leucippus and Democritus in the Metaphysics.26 CONCLUSION It has been seen that Theophrastus' treatment of Presocratic causes owes not only its general point of view but also much of the detail of its organization and wording to the Metaphysics A summary, and that his departures from that summary are usually only for the purpose of gathering additional material from Aristotle's other ac- counts and from the works of the Presocratics. The improbabilities and demonstrable errors that arise directly from his close adherence to one or other of Aristotle's accounts need not be retold here. I take it as self-evident that, when he merely copies or paraphrases an erroneous or improbable account from Aristotle, his copy or para- phrase is no better or worse than its original. There remains to con- sider briefly some of the features of his work that, although due to his use of Aristotle, are due to his method of using the text of Aristotle rather than to Aristotle's intentions. I) Theophrastus' practice of supplementing the Metaphysics summary with statements made by Aristotle in other contexts often causes his accounts to be a bewildering patchwork of ill-fitting pieces. In Metaphysics A, Aristotle does not say what mechanism of change was used by the Milesians. In the Physics (I87 A I2-I6) he says that all physical monists accounted for change by rarefaction and condensation. This latter statement Theophrastus applies not only to Anaximenes and Diogenes, of whom it is true; he also applies it to Hippasus and Heraclitus, of whom, as Aristotle knows, it cannot be true (see pages 93 ff.). Aristotle omits Anaximander from the Metaphysics summary. Theophrastus resorts, therefore, to two Physics interpretations in one of which Anaximander is a monist and in the other, both a monist and pluralist. The contradiction in the second interpretation, Theophrastus pretends to solve by accepting Aristotle's patently false identification of the primordial mixture with un- differentiated matter (see pages Ioo f.). Similarly, according to the account taken from the Metaphysics, Anaxagoras is said to have posited infinite material principles, but by the interpretation just mentioned he becomes, like Anaximander, a monist (see pages II3 f.). In Empedocles Theophrastus finds the inconsistency that some- 129</page><page sequence="46">John B. McDiarmid times the material principles are four and sometimes six. This in- consistency, however, is due not to failure on the part of Empedocles but to Theophrastus' juxtaposition of two separate interpretations of Aristotle, the latter of which rests on the view that Empedocles' Sphere is a homogeneous compound (see pages 107 f.). The atomists, according to the interpretation of the Metaphysics, differed from the Milesians only in substituting shape, order, and position for the rare and dense; but by the interpretation taken from the De Genera- tione their doctrine is related to the Eleatics, and a different account is given of their material principles and of their theory of change (see pages 124 f.). This sort of confusion and contradiction was probably characteristic of all Theophrastus' doxographical writings; for some of the accounts in the De Sensibus are not only inconsistent with the accounts of the principles but also contain inner contradic- tions (see page 128). 2) The interpretations that Theophrastus has borrowed from Aristotle are often only one or two out of several different interpre- tations that Aristotle offers of a theory. It cannot be said that Theo- phrastus' use of one interpretation gives that interpretation added weight unless we are prepared to maintain that he has considered the merits of the various possibilities, has chosen one, and has consciously discarded those that do not agree with it. The contradictions observed in the preceding paragraph would be impossible if this were the case. The factor that governed his selection was clearly the availability of material. In Metaphysics A he found Aristotle's most comprehensive discussion of causal theories; from this he went to other passages in which Aristotle discusses several doctrines in a small space, notably Physics A.4 and De Generatione A.8; and he referred to special dis- cussions of individual philosophers only when, as for Anaximander, these general passages were inadequate. This method is almost bound to do injustice both to the author excerpted and to the facts of the doctrines discussed. Even if Aristotle's interpretations are all in- fluenced by his own beliefs, it is clear - and must have been to him - that some are more in accord with the stated doctrines of the Pre- socratics than others are. As it happens, some of the accounts in the passages that Theophrastus has used are sheer conjecture, whereas some that fall in passages that Theophrastus has not used are un- doubtedly nearer the truth, e.g., Aristotle's report of how Heraclitus described change (see page 95). 3) The fact that Theophrastus extracts Aristotle's interpretations from their contexts is a frequent source of misrepresentation and con- I30</page><page sequence="47">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes fusion. Aristotle's interpretations are not doxographical accounts; they are parts of philosophical debates in which he is far from being a disinterested judge (Cherniss, pp. 347-350). The context usually warns us of the particular twist that he is likely to give a doctrine. In Theophrastus there is no such warning, and when he recasts Aristotle's arguments they assume the form of straightforward exposition. Needless to say, our lack of context becomes especially serious when Theophrastus compounds his report from two or more different passages, in each of which Aristotle's argument depends on a different set of assumptions about a doctrine. This difficulty is well illustrated by Theophrastus' double interpretation of Anaximan- der and Anaxagoras; for without the context of Aristotle we do not know on what grounds the material cause of these philosophers can be regarded as both singular and plural. 4) Theophrastus does not always reproduce accurately the details of the accounts that he has borrowed. Sometimes the inaccuracies are of slight importance, but they should be noted because they are characteristic of the sort of change that has frequently taken place between the original statement of Aristotle and the statement as it appears in the later doxographers. It has been seen how Aristotle's conjecture about the views of Thales has, through the Physical Opin- ions, hardened into a definite statement that Aristotle deliberately avoided (see pages 92 f.). One further example should be added. The basis of the doxographical tradition about early notions of matter is the equation with Aristotelian prime matter. This equation is derived by Theophrastus from the Metaphysics, but Theophrastus has neg- lected the qualification that Aristotle attaches to it. Aristotle prefaces his discussion of the early material principles with a reference to them as principles "in the form of matter" (Metaphysics 983 B 7) and thus indicates that these principles, being elements or some other definite bodies, are not primitive matter in his sense at all and that therefore the similarity between these principles and his own is at best very limited. 5) Two special types of misrepresentation that are caused by Theophrastus' disregard for Aristotle's precise words should be mentioned. First, he tends to overinterpret Aristotle's statements. When Aristotle says, for example, that the principle of Thales and Hippo was water, that of Anaximenes and Diogenes air, and that of Hippasus and Heraclitus fire, he probably means no more than that. There is no reason to conclude, as Theophrastus apparently does, that when he elsewhere refers to anonymous doctrines whose prin- I3I</page><page sequence="48">ciples were the elements, he is referring to the members of these pairs. His attribution of rarefaction-condensation to the monists as a group is only what follows from the presuppositions of his own system, and his failure to mention names is perhaps to be explained by his lack of definite evidence. Furthermore, when he links two philosophers with respect to one theory, it does not follow that when he mentions one member of the pair elsewhere he must mean both. So, although Theophrastus was right in understanding him to mean that the material causes of Anaximander and Anaxagoras were similar, it does not necessarily follow, as Theophrastus supposes, that he means that Anaximander subscribes to Anaxagoras' homoeomery theory. Much of the later doxographical tradition relating to little known figures like Thales and Hippasus is probably due to over- interpretation of this sort. 6) A second kind of overinterpretation is the development of biography from doctrinal affinities. The most striking example of this is the connection that Theophrastus makes between the Milesians, Eleatics, and atomists. From Aristotle's logical reconstruction of the relationship of their doctrines, Theophrastus has produced a scheme of teacher-student relationships: Anaximander-Xenophanes-Parmeni- des-Leucippus-Democritus (see pages 118 f. and 125 f.). Similar in origin are probably also the links Parmenides-Empedocles and Archelaus-Socrates (see notes 90 and I43). The series Thales- Anaximander-Anaximenes-Anaxagoras-Archelaus, which appears con- sistently in the doxographers, probably starts with Theophrastus and may have been derived in the same way (see note 117). It may be objected that Theophrastus was in the position to know such facts about the lives of at least the later Presocratics. But Aristotle, who might be expected to be no less well informed than Theophrastus, reports only that Parmenides "is said" to have been the student of Xenophanes and that Democritus was the associate of Leucippus. This fact is significant because one of the premises of the Metaphysics summary is the continuity in the evolution of causal theory, and the biographical connections stated by Theophrastus coincide to a marked degree with what Aristotle imagines the course of this evolu- tion to have been. Those who will not concede that Theophrastus has made history out of logic must explain why Aristotle has failed to confirm his logic by history. 7) The common supposition that Theophrastus made use of the original writings of the Presocratics is supported, in the fragments studied, by his quotations from almost all the major Presocratics John B. McDiarmid 132</page><page sequence="49">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes after Thales. The texts of the Presocratics are, however, no protection against the influence of Aristotle, for in almost every instance the meaning of the quotation is distorted in order to yield proof of an Aristotelian interpretation that is clearly impossible. Thus, Anaxi- mander's metaphor about justice is proof of Aristotelian contrariety (see pages 98 f.); Heraclitus' figure about the exchange of things for fire is interpreted as evidence of rarefaction-condensation (see page 94); verses from Empedocles are quoted as proof that he posited six material principles (see pages 107 f.); Anaxagoras is rightly quoted to the effect that the nature of things is due to the predom- inance in them of one kind of particle, and the process of generation is rightly understood to be the movement of like to like, but a few lines later the primitive mixture is treated as a unified substratum of qualitative change (see pages I I2 if.); and, although Theophrastus has apparently referred to enough of Parmenides' poem to know that the second part of it is the opinion of the multitude, he nevertheless accepts Aristotle's interpretation which is based on this part (see pages I 2 f.). Furthermore, there is no indication that in compiling his accounts of the causal theories he made use of much more - if any more - of the original writings than he quotes. Several of his quota- tions appear to be the basis of the Aristotelian interpretation that he repeats. This suggests that he may not have consulted the complete texts of the Presocratics at all but may have referred to a collection of excerpts made for use in the Lyceum. In sum, the fragments considered disclose no evidence that Theo- phrastus employed his knowledge of the Presocratics in such a way as to exercise independent judgment about them. Despite his apparent investigation of the original texts, his accounts are in all essentials simply repetitions of some of the interpretations that he found in Aristotle and have, therefore, the same deficiencies. Further, by his method of selection and adaptation he has frequently misrepresented his source and has exaggerated the faults present in it. It must be concluded that, with regard to the Presocratic causes at least, he is a thoroughly biased witness and is even less trustworthy than Aristotle. NOTES i.

Cf. also Aetius, 1,3,1. Several minor points in the Theophrastus text should be noted: (I) ra veKpoviueva ,77paiveraT (Dox., p. 475, 5-6). Cf. dac/opovrTa 6e 77Lpatverat (Aetius, 1,3,1). Both sentences are from Theophrastus, but neither one represents the original form completely. In the Simplicius quotation it has just been stated that the warm lives by the moist, and we expect the converse statement that, when the warm is deprived of moisture, it dies. The lack of reference to the connection between moisture and life in Aetius deprives his sentence of signifi- cance in the present context. Hippo, whose doctrine is undoubtedly being repre- sented here, is reported to have said, oTav 68 dva?7rlpavOLi, dcvaLa-Tr7re 7 e TIWlov Kal daroOvi'aKeL (Vors., I, p. 386, 26=Anonymi Londonensis, latrica, XI, 27-28). Theophrastus probably wrote something like this: ra dauotpovrTa (or a/Iolpa ovTa) nrlpaiveraTI Kai drro0v77aKei. (The verb veKp6w used by Simplicius is ap- parently not found before Galen.) (2) e4 oUv 6' eaTtv eKaara, TroUr Kal TpeqpearOat 7re'qKe (Dox., p. 475, 7). Noth- ing in Aristotle or Aetius corresponds exactly to this. It makes sense only as an argument that since seed is moist nurture must be. In this case it is superfluous,</page><page sequence="52">John B. McDiarmid since Theophrastus has already stated in his preceding sentence that Thales and Hippo observed that both seed and nature are moist. Theophrastus does not give the connection between this observation and the assertion that water is the principle. Aristotle makes the connection by saying rT 5' e ov Y'yiverLT, roOr' earil tpxo 7raivTwv (Metaphysics 983 B 24-25). It is suggested that Theophrastus, too, had originally written something of this sort, e.g., et ovi e e 7Lv e'KacTa Kac Tpefaoat 7re/pVKe roOr' eOriLY dpx?- Tr 8de v wp dpX-i TrS V ypls (vaews eaTT KTX. The argument would then be: (a) the seed and nurture of every thing are moist; (b) that from which things have their being and nurture is their principle; (c) water is the principle of moist things; (d) water is, therefore, the principle of all things. (3) acvveEKTLKcb 7ra'rCW (Dox., p. 475, 8). The phrase is rightly suspect because OVVeKTtKOS is a Stoic word (Diels, ad loc.). But auveXetv is used with the same meaning by Aristotle and might easily have been changed in Theophrastus by Alexander or Simplicius. For moisture as the thing that gives shape to the dry, see Aristotle, Meteorologica 381 B 28 -382 A 5; for moisture as the avvexov, see De Generatione 334 B 31 -335 A 3. i6. Metaphysics 983 B 27 -984 A 3. Aristotle will not vouch for this tradition, and he is doubtful even of Thales. The tradition referred to is a playful suggestion by Plato that Heraclitus and the other physicists derived their doctrine of flux from Homer (Cratylus 402 B, Theaetetus 152 E, I60 D, i80 C). That Aristotle can take Plato's humor so seriously prompts the question how much he may have been influenced by Plato to begin the history of philosophy with Thales. He assumes as self-evident that men's first interest was in the material source of things. He may have reasoned that, since the earliest of those who framed myths about the gods (983 B 29) identified this source as water, it was to be expected that the earliest philosophers (983 B 6-7) take this opinion as their starting-point. Aristotle's entire treatment of the early philosophers exhibits a tendency to make history conform to common sense. In another fragment (Scholiast to Apollonius Rhodius, II, I248-Dox., p. 475, n. i ), Theophrastus says that Prometheus was the first to share philosophy with men and that for this reason the myth arose that he shared fire with them. This fragment is probably from Theophrastus' Ilepi 'Evup7udrTW. As Burnet (p. 40, n. 2) points out, it is "merely an application of Peripatetic literalism to a phrase of Plato's" (cf. Philebus i6 C and Protagoras 32I C). I7. Metaphysics 983 B 6-i8. i8. Metaphysics 983 B 8-13. His expression here, rTs fevP o6aias vuroteEvovar7s, Tros e 7radOecat ferTa3aXXo\\ov7s (983 B 9-I0), makes certain his identification of the material principle with his substrate. This identification is evident throughout Metaphysics A in his references to matter as r6 v7roKefL.epov or X7 VuroKefievi7 oVOLa (983 A 30, 983 B i6, 984 A 21-22, 985 B Io). Elsewhere he says more explicitly that those who generate all things from one principle must hold that generation is the qualitative change of the substrate (De Generatione 314 A 8-II, 314 B 1-4). 19. W. A. Heidel, "Qualitative Change in Pre-Socratic Philosophy," A. G. Ph., XIX (I906), p. 337. 20. Metaphysics 984 A 3-5. Simplicius says that Hippo seems to have been an atheist (Dox., p. 475,3). This is probably not from Theophrastus. Alexander (Metaph. p. 26,21 ff.), com- I36</page><page sequence="53">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes menting on Metaphysics 984 A 3-5, suggests that Aristotle may have rejected Hippo's doctrine because it was superficial or obscure, because of the paltriness of Hippo's mind rather than of his doctrine, or because he was an atheist. Sim- plicius and other commentators, apparently accepting Alexander's last suggestion as a fact, state dogmatically that Aristotle regards Hippo as an atheist, and they give as reasons that Hippo was a thorough materialist and made water the cause of all things. (Simplicius, De An., p. 32, 17 ff; Philoponus, De An., p. 88, 23 ff; Brandis, Scholia in Aristotelem, p. 534 A 4-26). That Hippo was a materialist and an atheist seems to have been common knowledge; it is reported that Cratinus attacked him for impiety and lampooned him in the same way as Aristophanes lampooned Socrates (Vors., I, p. 385, 9-16). That these are the reasons for Aristotle's contemptuous treatment of Hippo is very doubtful, for they would apply equally well to several other Presocratics who are not so treated. If Alexander could have appealed to the authority of Theophrastus on the matter, he would probably have done so. His reference to Hippo's atheism seems to be based merely on Hippo's traditional reputation. Simplicius in ex- cerpting the fragments of the Physical Opinions from Alexander has, it seems, unwittingly included this comment as if it were from Theophrastus. 21.

Diels (ad loc.) treats this sentence as a comment of Simplicius and not as part of the Theophrastus fragment. But, as will be seen, it is the practice of Theophrastus to quote from the Presocratic writings in support of his interpretations. It is not unlikely that, when no such writings are available, he should comment on this fact, particularly in the case of such an important figure as Thales. HERACLITUS AND HIPPASUS 27. Metaphysics 984 A 7-8. 28. Physical Opinions, frag. I (=Dox., pp. 475, I4-476, 2=Simplicius, Phys., pp. 23, 33- 24, 6). The account quoted by Simplicius closes with the statement that Heraclitus set a certain order and limited time for the change of the world in accordance with a fated necessity. (Dox., p. 476, 1-2.) This is not evidence that The- ophrastus attributes a periodic conflagration to Heraclitus. The language here shows the influence of Stoic interpretation. The word used for fate is eflAap/v-r), which is a technical Stoic word. Heraclitus would probably use xp?7lr/oavv71 or xpe^v (see Heraclitus, frag. 65 and Heidel, A.G.Ph., XIX [1906], p. 35I, n. 46), which Theophrastus correctly interpreted as a reference to the order in the con- tinuous generation and destruction of things (cf. Heraclitus, frag. 30). Later writers take this to mean that there is a periodic general destruction of the uni- verse (Diogenes Laertius, IX, 7-8); but Theophrastus no more ascribes this notion to Heraclitus than he does to Anaximander, in whom he apparently also I37</page><page sequence="54">finds the same concept of ordered change (cf. Dox., p. 476, Io-II and note 57). He is concerned with fire not in its purely cosmological aspects but in its func- tion as the material cause of all generation and destruction. (On the supposed evidence of Aristotle for the periodic conflagration, see Cherniss, p. 29, n. Io8). 29. See note i8. 30. Physics 187 A 12-16 (here Anaximander is excepted).

Physical Opinions, frag. 2 (=Dox., p. 476, 3-II =Simplicius, Phys., p. 24, I3-2I). Theophrastus also says, 'Avaitfxav8pos ..... cpX7Tv re Kal aTotXEo v e'LpIKe rTiv 6vrtv 7T aTretpov, 7rpwTro Troro TOVVOlta Ko/tLUas rT7S dapXs. Two main interpreta- tions have been given of this: that, according to Theophrastus, Anaximander introduced the name daretpov of the material cause (Burnet, p. 54, n. 2); and that Anaximander introduced the term dpx; and Theophrastus has added a-rot0X eiov to define this term in Peripatetic phraseology (W. Heidel, C.P., VII [I912], pp. 215-216 and W. Jaeger, The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers, pp. 24- 28). Other ancient evidence is inconclusive: (a) Hippolytus, Refut., I, 6,2: oVTros fLe oiv (Anaximander) appX7v Kai aTrotxeov etLp7Ke TWV ovrrWv TO aTreLpov, 7rpUros 7TOVVOcLa KaXctas rTS apXips. It has been argued that Tr7S dpxs here is against the first view, since riv cpx'jv is required with KaXcraas (Jaeger, op. cit. p. 201, n. 27). This objection holds only if it be supposed that Theophrastus originally wrote KcaXe'Tas rather than the KopiLaas preserved by Simplicius. If he did not, the question is not what Theophrastus meant but only what Hippolytus, or some intermediate writer, thought he meant. In fact, if John B. McDiarmid I38</page><page sequence="55">Tkeophrastus on the Presocratic Causes Theophrastus wrote Kouit'as, the rTs dpXvs in Simplicius is just as embarrassing to the second view; for there r*v dpXYrv is expected in apposition to Trovola. (b) Simplicius, Phys., p. I50, 23: 7rpcwro aOrbT (Anaximander) dpX^iv dvoAcdara rb vuroKeltLeov. This seems to support the second view. Burnet's translation, "being the first to name the substratum of the opposites as the material cause," not only does not render the Greek (Jaeger, op. cit. p. 201, n. 28); it makes no sense, since Simplicius has already treated the water of Thales as a material substratum of the opposites (Phys., p. 149, 5-7 and p. I50, 1I-12). If, however, Simplicius means that Anaximander was the first to call the substratum by the name dpX7, his remark is not much to the point. He is commenting on Aris- totle's division of doctrines into those that explained generation by a single material principle and the opposites and those that explained it not by alteration but by a separation of the opposites from the material principle. Of this latter doctrine he says: evolvaas c yp &amp;as evavrto6rrTas ev r' iVroKettLevCp, diretpw iPTv OaW/fTa7, eKKcpivecrOaal lcrvv 'AvaiFjtav5pos, rrprTos avrbs dpx7Pv 6vouciaas rb ViroKel- jtevov (Phys., p. I50, 22-24). Anaximander is the first philosopher named by Aristotle as holding this doctrine, and it is the fundamental difference between his material principle and those of the other Ionians that interests Simplicius. If the invention of any term is appropriate to the discussion, it is the invention of the Infinite. (The suggestion is offered that where the manuscripts read aro6s Simplicius may have written ofrws: "first by this name (Infinite) calling the substrate a principle.") (c) Simplicius, De Caelo, p. 6I5, I5: rireLpov 5e rpc3ros (Anaximander) b'reOero. This clearly supports the first view. If any solution is to be reached it can only be on the basis of what seems probable from the general point of view observed in the other fragments of the Physical Opinions. The other fragments reveal no interest in the invention of Peripatetic phraseology. Theophrastus is interested in the nature and function of Presocratic causes; for the most part he speaks as if the Presocratics already used later terminology (e.g., Terotxela in Empedocles [Dox., p. 478, 1-2]), and it is only when the name of a cause is peculiar to a philosopher or the function of it is not self-evident that he makes a point of the name employed by his predecessor (Dox., p. 478, 4; 479, 8; 485, 2). The question he asks is how the theory of each philosopher differed from that of his predecessors. Each of the earlier philosophers under each heading is the first to hold that doctrine. This is implied when it is not explicitly stated. Thus, Anaxagoras is said to be the first to add the "missing cause" and Parmenides is the first to say that the world is spheroid (Dox., p. 478, 19 f.; 482, 17); but it is understood that Thales is the first to make his principle water and Anaximenes, air. In the sentence following the one in question, Theophrastus makes it clearer what Anaximander was first to do: Xc'yet 5e avrrv (i.e., rTv adpx4v) Ar'Te 6Swp /,ire &amp;XXo rt rTW KaXovl/4vwv elvaL o'rozxelwv, aXX' erepav rTv'a eoptav a7retpov ..... (Dox., p. 476, 6-7). Anaxi- mander was the first to make his principle the 6dretpov, signifying by this name some infinite body other than the elements. Finally, the suggestion that Theophrastus added arrotxeiov to define Anaxi- mander's term dpXr7 is answered by Heidel's admission (loc. cit.) that such col- locations as adpXl Kal aorotxeiov are common in Aristotle (see Bonitz, Index Aristotelicus, p. 702 a 26 ff.). One instance is found in a passage of the Meta- physics that has already been shown to have influenced Theophrastus: et ov yap gartv &amp;wravra Tr&amp; vra . .. T. roVro rToXeLov Kat' TravrT7V dpx71 faotv eatV vat Tr3 139</page><page sequence="56">John B. McDiarmid ovrcwv (983 B 8-II). If it is to be maintained that Anaximander used the term cpX77 and that Theophrastus defined it by aroLXEZov, there is just as good reason to say that irv rp&amp;rwv (ptXo -rocp'raavTPw r ol TrXeaot, of whom Aristotle is here speaking, used the term arotxeZov and Aristotle added dpX7i to define it. 47. Physics 204 B 22-29, 187 A 20-26. 48. Diels ("Anaximandros von Milet," N.Jbb., XXVI [1923] p. 69) says: "Ein Unrecht, eine adiKcil ist es, wenn das Individuum sich aus dem unendlichen Ganzen losl6st. Diesen Frevelmut zahlt es mit dem Tode, die Geburt des einen ist mit dem Tode des anderen verkniipft." (Cf. R. Mondolfo, Problemi del pensiero antico, chapter II.) But, as Heidel (loc. cit., p. 234) remarks of this view, "That were in truth justice with a vengeance." The fact that reparation is made "to one another" (ciXXjXots, Dox., p. 476, io) is conclusive evidence against Diels. G. Vlastos ("Equality and Justice in the Early Greek Cosmol- ogies," C.P., XLII [1947], p. I69-172) recognizes the difficulty of Diels's position, but his attempt to cope with this difficulty is unsuccessful. He argues that it is the opposites that commit injustice against one another and that their penalty is reabsorption or blending into the Infinite. This reabsorption, he believes, does not really involve destruction; it is "only a process which insures full reparation among the opposites themselves." But the text of Theophrastus does not speak of the generation and destruction of the opposites. It speaks of the generation and destruction of things (Tros oVt't, Dox., p. 476, 9); and - if any proof be needed that "things" include more than the opposites - the preceding sentence of the text refers explicitly to the generation of the heavens and worlds from the principle (Dox., p. 476, 7-8). Certainly it will not be proposed that the heavens and the worlds retain their identity after dissolution into the Infinite; and, since no distinction is made between different kinds of things, presumably all kinds of things suffer the same sort of destruction as the heavens and worlds do. H. Frankel (Dichtung und Philosophie des Friihen Griechentums, p. 345-347) sees rightly that the things generated and destroyed are all things that exist, and he is of the opinion that the sin of a thing is that it seizes on the potentialities of other things that might have come into being in its place. This theory saves the facts of the text but reads more into the text than is there. 49. Xenophanes, frag. 27. 50. Heidel, loc. cit. 5I. Metaphysics 983 B 6-II.

Like many later interpreters, Diels failed to see fully the significance of the parallels for the fragment of Anaximander. 55. Aristotle not only assumes that the early philosophers in general employed the principle of circular change; he uses this principle to refute their theories. One of his arguments against Anaximander is that this principle disproves the existence of an infinite body apart from the elements (Physics 204 B 29 - 205 A i). He does not say that Anaximander recognized this principle but neglected I40</page><page sequence="57">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes its consequences; the implication is, rather, that if Anaximander had employed the principle of circular change, he could not have set up his Infinite in the first place. 56. It can hardly have escaped either Aristotle or the Presocratics that, if the stock of primitive matter is infinite, circular change is unnecessary. It is neces- sary only if matter is finite, as it is in the system of Aristotle; for, if change is not circular, matter must eventually be exhausted. According to Aetius (I, 3, 3), whose testimony on this point is evidently derived from Aristotle (Physics 203 B 18-20) through Theophrastus, it was in order to prevent the exhaustion of matter that Anaximander made his principle infinite. In this case, Anaxi- mander did not argue the existence of the infinite material principle from the fact of circular change, as Aristotle would hold in the Metaphysics; and whatever he said about circular change was probably limited to change between things already differentiated from the Infinite. Cf. W. Kraus, "Das Wesen des Un- endlichen des Anaximander," Rh. M., XCIII (1950), pp. 371 f. 57. The immediate passage containing the fragment of Anaximander reads: We xv de i yeveoai' E'rt rots oVcO, Kati rrv p0opav els rauTra 'ylveacrat Kar&amp; rb Xpewv, 8t66vat yap atra ilK7v KaI rtlcra dcXX7jXots TjrS a&amp;Kstas KaTa r r'v o Xpo6vov rdCitv, rrot,irtLKwrepoLs o owso dol v6aaac aOTra Xiywv (Dox., p. 476, 8-II).

The following comments are offered on some details: (I) ed wv e 'ye'veis Ian rots ouO'L Kai TrIv r? p0opav els ravira yvecorOat. Cherniss (op. cit., pp. 376 f.) sees in the use of the plurals (dWv and raOra) evidence that Theophrastus knew that the Infinite was a multitude of bodies and not a single entity. Since, however, the clause is a generally applied formula of Aristotle and is probably not even a paraphrase of Anaximander's words, the plurals cannot have this significance. Probably they have no special significance at all. Aristotle sometimes uses the plural in such statements (Metaphysics iooo B 25-26, De Generatione 325 B I8-19), and sometimes the singular (Metaphysics 983 B 8, Nicomachean Ethics II73 B 5-6); and in two otherwise identical passages the manuscripts agree on the singular in one place (Physics 204 B 33-34), while in the other some manscripts read the singular and others the plural (Meta- physics io66 B 37, on which see Ross's critical apparatus). The fact that Aetius always expresses the formula in the singular is probable evidence that Theo- phrastus had done so, as Aristotle does at Metaphysics 983 B 8. It will be noted, too, that immediately before the sentence in question Theophrastus uses the singular et 7s of the Infinite (Dox., p. 476, 7). This proves that, even if et wv is from Theophrastus, he does not consistently regard the Infinite as a plurality. (2) a) Kara To xpewv, b) Kaa Tr rov -oo xp6vov ratv. The first of these may be from Anaximander; the second has a Peripatetic flavor (cf. Aristotle, Politics I26i A 34, Meteorologica 35I A 25-26; Theophrastus, Metaphysics 6 b 27-7 a 15). Dirlmeier ("Die Satz des Anaximandros von Milet," Rh. M., LXXXVII [I938], pp. 380 f.) suggests that the second is Theophrastus' paraphrase of the first and that Theophrastus is interpreting Anaximander's reference to necessity as meaning that change is not chaotic but is governed by a temporal order.

In the first two passages the temporal order is linked to necessity or fate; and some reference to fate was probably also found in the source of the third, since Theophrastus seems to have treated the doctrines of Hippasus and Heraclitus as identical in most important details. Finally, the parallel should be noted between the fourth passage and the sentence in Theophrastus immediately before the passage under examination: ie rs aravTas rytveacOal roUs ovpavovs Kal Tros ev aTroZs KoaJuovs (Dox., p. 476, 7-8). No one of these pieces of evidence is con- clusive, but taken together they allow a reasonable conjecture that necessity and the temporal order were linked in the original text of Theophrastus also and that they referred to the generation and destruction of the heavens and the worlds in them. Thus, Theophrastus may have written: e t rs daras ....

The passages noted above, particularly the first, make this interpretation improbable. 58. Dox., p. 476, I-I4. 59. Physics 204 B 22-29. 6o. Cherniss, p. 28. 6i. Aristotle, De Generatione 3I4 A 8-iI, 3I4 B I-4. 62. Dox., p. 476, I3-i6. (Cf. Aristotle, Physics I87 A 26-31). This is the source of all later doxographical statements that attribute eternal motion to Anaximander. It is impossible to determine what firsthand evidence Theophrastus had for it. Probably he has merely drawn his own conclusion from some of Aristotle's general statements about early views of change. In the Metaphysics (984 A 27-29) Aristotle says that the early monists had not troubled to give a cause of motion, the implication being that motion simply exists, without a cause of its beginning or its end. Elsewhere he says that those physicists who posit a single principle declare it to be in motion (Physics I84 B I5-i8), and that those who hold that there are infinite worlds, some coming into being and some perishing, declare that motion is eternal (Physics 250 B 15-20). But, again, he implies that Leucippus was the first to state that motion is eternal (Meta- physics I07I B 26-33; cf. Cherniss, p. I73, n. 128). 63. Dox., p. 479, 2 ff. 64. E.g., Zeller, I, pp. 279 ff. Zeller's reasoning is throughout strongly in- fluenced by his predisposition to take the accounts of Aristotle and Theophrastus at their face value. A detailed refutation of his view is not necessary. The question I42</page><page sequence="59">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes is settled by the correct interpretation of eKEZvos (Dox., p. 479, 4). Zeller (I, p. 280, n. 5) refers this to Anaxagoras (as do Diels [ad loc.] and Kranz [Vors., II, I5, 24]); but, as Heidel points out (C.P., VII [1912], p. 230, n. 3), eKeivos must be Anaximander. Not only does normal Greek usage require that this word refer to the former of the two names mentioned, i.e., Anaximander; but, unless eKEiVOs is Anaximander, the comparison with Anaxagoras breaks down; and the reference to Anaxagoras by name in the following sentence is not needed unless a change of subject is to be indicated. (If with Zeller we take iKeievos as Anaxagoras, the gist of the argument is: i) Anaxagoras held the homoeomery theory; 2) and Theophrastus says that Anaxagoras' theory was like that of Anaximander; 3) for Anaxagoras held the homoeomery theory. Even if we allow this curious reasoning to stand, is it not still implied that Anaximander held the homoeomery theory?) Furthermore, there is no basis for Zeller's statement that, according to Theophrastus, the comparison with Anaximander is contingent on the assumption that Anaxagoras' material principle was unitary (op. cit., p. 280). The relevant portion of the text reads: 'Kai ov7w dfev ouv' p7)a'i (Theophrastus) 'XauM3avY'6vrv fo5eteV av v rotev rTas /ev vXtLK cas Idpxs reLpovs, ao7rep etp7lTat, T77V T 7'S Kivrr'Jews Kal 7rs yeveofew afTliav AtLLa. el be TLs rit v titv Trv iradvTwv v7roXad3ot /.Ltav etvait vaLv dti6ptaov Kal Ka7r' eltos Kai KaraT [.eyeOos, o7rep av 56?ete 3ovuXeOaLi X\yetiv, avui.alveta o ra0 a7 cpxas avrobv Xeyetv r77v re 7ro aTretpov Otvatv Kat ro7v vooV, ware 7rdvTrws faliverat Td a'wLf. aTtKa aTo0Lxeta 7rapa- TrX7o-iws 7rotClv 'Avait/davspy' (Dox., p. 479, 9-16). Clearly, the last clause (coaTre . . . 'Avat/i5i,vpyU) is meant to go with both its own sentence and the preceding one; the meaning is that, whether Anaxagoras' material principle be regarded as plural or singular, it is similar to that of Anaximander. 65. Augustine, Civitas Dei, VIII, 2. 66. Physics 187 A 20-26. Here it is implied that the material principle of Anaximander was a mixture; it is expressly stated in a similar connection at Metaphysics 1069 B 20-22. 67. Cherniss, pp. I40-I42. 68. W. A.

Physical Opinions, frag. 2 (= Dox., pp. 476, i6-477, 5 = Simplicius, Phys., pp. 24, 26- 25, i). Elsewhere Simplicius says erW . . . rorTOVTOU .vov (i.e., 'Avat/,uevov) Oe6popaaros ev Tn ioaToptqt r7Tv iadvwratv e'prVKe Kai T7rV TrKVOKw'V (Dox., p. 477, n. i = Phys., p. 149, 32 ff.). This sentence is strange because, on the authority of Theophrastus, Simplicius ascribes rarefaction and condensation to Hippasus, Heraclitus (Dox., p. 475, I5-I7) and Diogenes of Apollonia (Dox., p. 477, 9). The suggestions that t6ovov = 7rpSrTov (Diels) and that irpowrov should be read for yoMvov (Usener) are not convincing. If Theophrastus meant rpcTros there is no reason why he should have risked ambiguity by using ,rsoos with the meaning TrpUros; and that Simplicius understood him to mean 6,6vos is shown by Simplicius' next sentence, rXov e us Kai ol a\XX\ot Trf jtav57r7T KaI 7rVKpV6T7Tt eiXp,vro (Phys., p. I50, I-2). It is possible, of course, that Simplicius I43</page><page sequence="60">misunderstood Theophrastus or that Theophrastus simply contradicted himself (for similar contradictions see Theophrastus, De Sensibus, 38, and Stratton, ad loc.; Aristotle, De Generatione 323 B io-II and Cherniss, p. 9I, n. 387). But if neither is the case, it is difficult to see how Theophrastus could have denied rarefaction and condensation to Diogenes. Probably, as Zeller suggests (I, p. 322, n. i), Simplicius is thinking only of the earliest Ionians. Aristotle's assertion that all the monists employed rarefaction and condensation (Physics I87 A 12-16; cf. De Caelo 303 B 13-17) is only what he considers to be the con- sequence of a single material principle. Very probably neither he nor Theo- phrastus had any knowledge of how Thales accounted for change; both ascribe to Anaximander the mechanism of Anaxagoras; and the vagueness of Aristotle's reference to Heraclitus' mechanism of change suggests that he was not sure of Heraclitus' meaning. Theophrastus could attribute rarefaction-condensation to Heraclitus and the other monists on the grounds that this was the only mechanism of change possible in their systems. His statement regarding Anax- imenes probably should not be taken to mean that he thinks no other Ionian employed rarefaction-condensation but that Anaximenes was the only one who did so explicitly (cf. Dox., p. 493, 5: uL6'os i dXTcra). 73. Metaphysics 984 A 5-7. 74. See notes 9, 30, and 62. 75. Theophrastus calls air 7 v7roKeLtfe'r7 uvCaLs. See note I8. 76. De Generatione 330 B 7-I3. 77. Despite his interpretation of rarefaction and condensation as qualitative change, Aristotle, too, in one passage recognizes what must have been the general view of the Presocratics on this matter. He says that all affections have their source in condensation and rarefaction, that heavy and light, soft and hard, hot and cold, are considered to be forms of density and rarity, and that condensation and rarefaction are combination and separation, by which are caused the generation and destruction of substances (Physics 260 B 7-I2). 78. Cicero (Acad., II, 37, 118), who is dependent on Theophrastus, goes even farther than Theophrastus. He names the products of air as fire, water, and earth, and he says that other things are formed from these. 79.

The detailed information given by Theophrastus on Diogenes' psycho- logical theory (De Sensibus, 39-48) indicates firsthand knowledge of Diogenes' work. Simplicius (Phys., p. 25, 7-8) says that Diogenes' writings were extant in his time. In preserved fragments Diogenes does not say that air is infinite. Theophrastus may have got this from Aristotle's assertion that all physicists regarded their principles as infinite (Physics 203 A I6-i8). So too, the des- cription of air as eternal may be from Aristotle's similar statement about the infinite principles of the physicists (Physics 203 B I3-15). 82. Frag. 6 (Vors., II, p. 65, I3-14). 83.

Neither Aristotle nor Theophrastus enumerates Diogenes' borrowings from these philosophers. On this see Zeller, I, pp. 354 ff. Theophras- tus says that Diogenes was almost the last of the physicists. EMPEDOCLES 88. Physical Opinions, frag. 3 (= Dox., pp. 477, I6-478, I5 = Simplicius, Phys., pp. 25, 19 - 26, 4). Theophrastus says that Empedocles was born not long after Anaxagoras and was the admirer and follower of Parmenides (Dox., p. 477, I7-18. See note 90). 89. Dox., p. 478, 8-io (Empedocles, frag. 17, 7-8). go. Metaphysics 984 A 8-i ; 985 A 21-33. Aristotle remarks that Anaxagoras was prior to Empedocles in age but later in works (Metaphysics 984 A II-I3). He is apparently attempting to justify his treatment of Empedocles before Anaxagoras by showing that in the real sense Empedocles was prior to Anaxagoras just as his four material principles are a logical step between the single principle of the Ionians and the infinite principles of Anaxagoras. Since Aristotle is prone to identify chronological and logical order, the fact that he considers such a remark necessary may indicate that it was generally known that Anaxagoras was born earlier than Empedocles. Theophrastus may have had good reason for adding that the difference in ages was not great; but it is at least equally possible that he has merely drawn his own conclusion from Aristotle's remark (cf. Ross ad Meta- physics 984 A 12; Cherniss, p. 219, n. 5; and C. E. Millerd, On the Interpreta- tion of Empedocles, p. I3). Simplicius says that Empedocles was IHapLevtiSov . . . 'X\rTS Kai Tr\XaaaoriT Kai eTL ftiXXov rTwv uvOayopeiwv (Dox., p. 477, I8). Of Empedocles' relationship to the Pythagoreans, Diels (ad loc.) rightly says, "narratio de Pythagoreorum disciplina aut aliena est a Theophrasto aut certe immutata redditur a Simplicio." Diogenes Laertius (VIII, 55) states: 6 5e Oe6oppaaTos HIapLieviov rpu 7Xqt J aXWT7rv aVrTOv yevPcOatL KaL /tgT7)TrV ev rols 7r0ot?Loaa KaiL yp eKelvov iv Ereo rbv repi v4OEWs eeveWyKeCv X6Yov. The indebtedness of Empedocles to Parmenides is evident not only in his mode of expression but also in his doctrine. But the use of 'rXaLtaarr's by Simplicius - unless, of course, this was written by Simplicius for an original /UAqT'TS preserved by Diogenes Laertius - seems to imply a closer relationship, that of student to teacher. In view of the relationships that Theophrastus attempts to establish between Anaximander and Xenophanes and between Xenophanes and Parmenides, it seems not unlikely that he believes a similar relationship to have existed between Parmenides and Empedocles-and for similar reasons (see page II9). Just as Aristotle represents the Eleatic doctrine as a development from the Ionian monism but does not suggest a teacher-student relationship between the two schools, so, too, by way of preface to his discussion of Empedocles' theory of efficient causality, he remarks that Parmenides had given Love an important place in his cosmogony (Metaphysics 984 B 23-31; cf. Cherniss, page 222), but he does not even hint that Empedocles was Parmenides' disciple. 9I. Dox., p. 478, 4-7. Cf. Empedocles, frag. I7, 6: Kati raur' dXX\aaovra tLa/.,uepes ovoalua X+jyec. 92.

Physical Opinions, frag. 4 (= Dox., pp. 478, i6 -479, I6 = Simplicius, Phys., pp. 26, 3I -27, 23). The account as given by Simplicius is repetitious and inconsistent. Certainly only part of it is an actual quotation from Theophrastus. About this part there can be no doubt, since Simplicius repeats it elsewhere in the same form under Theophrastus' name (Dox., p. 479, 9-I6; cf. Simplicius, Phys., p. I54, 16-23). The rest, if not a quotation, is at least an accurate paraphrase, since it is paral- leled by doxographers who have derived material from the Physical Opinions by other lines of transmission (Dox., pp. 478, 18-479, 5. Cf. Vors., II, pp. I9, 34 - 20, 8; 20, I3; 20, 37-38; 47, 9-I4). Anaxagoras is said by Theophrastus to have shared the philosophy of Anax- 146</page><page sequence="63">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes imenes (Dox., p. 478, 18-19). The doxographers say that Anaxagoras was the student of Anaximenes (Vors., II, pp. 5, 4-5; 8, 3-4; 8, 36-37; 8, 42-43; 19, 40- 41). Anaximenes was probably dead before Anaxagoras was born (Burnet, p. 253). Aristotle connects the doctrine of Anaxagoras with that of Anaximander (Physics 187 A 20-26), and Theophrastus follows him in this (Dox., p. 479, 3- 16). Theophrastus apparently thinks that the two philosophers were connected by more than the similarity of their doctrines, and he has attempted to fit them into a scheme of teacher-student relationship. Philosophy begins with Thales; Anaximander is the student of Thales (Dox., p. 476, 3-4); after Anaximander, philosophy divides and one of his students, Xenophanes (Dox., p. 482, 14- I5), becomes the first of the Eleatics, while the other, Anaximenes (Dox., p. 476, 16-17), continues the tradition of the physicists; Anaximenes, in turn, is followed by Anaxagoras. 118.

Aristotle is careful to say oXEov .... a7ravra ra 6oLotoLep~i, meaning by this, apparently, that there is only a rough correspondence between his homoeomeries and the principles of Anaxagoras. 128. Burnet (pp. 262 ff.) holds, with Tannery, that the seeds contain portions of the "traditional opposites" and that, according to Aristotle, the opposites have as much right to be called first principles as the homoeomeries have. This view, while seeming in part to be substantiated by the passages of Aristotle and The- ophrastus referred to above, is based on a misinterpretation of Physics 187 A 25 (see note 136). With regard to the fragments of Anaxagoras, it has been refuted in detail by C. Bailey (The Greek Atomists and Epicurus, pp. 538-542). 129. In extant fragments Anaxagoras speaks of airOp (frag. 2) but not of fire. Fire is Aristotle's interpretation. Cf. De Caelo 302 B 4-5. I30. De Generatione 314 A 18 - B i; De Caelo 302 A 28 - B 3. Aristotle says that Anaxagoras thought the elements to be compounds of flesh, bone, etc.; but Aristotle does not mean by this that there were no seeds of the elements. The difference between Anaxagoras and Empedocles was that Anax- agoras, by postulating an infinite variety of elementary bodies and asserting that everything contained portions of everything else, eliminated the possibility of such simple bodies as the four roots of Empedocles. Aristotle might merely have I47</page><page sequence="64">John B. McDiarmid said that, while the visible masses of the elements were pure and irreducible entities for Empedocles, Anaxagoras held that they contained portions of each other and of everything else. He makes the contrast sharper by the examples of Anaxagoras' seeds he chooses. Empedocles thought that bone and flesh were compounds of the elements. Anaxagoras would admit that a piece of bone con- tained seeds of the so-called elements, but he would add that it also contained seeds of gold and stone, etc., and that it was bone not because it contained seeds of the elements but because the seeds of bone in it predominated over the other seeds. In the same way he would maintain that what Empedocles called air contained seeds of bone, flesh, gold, stone, etc., but was air because of the predominance of the seeds of air. I3I.

This passage has been frequently misunderstood. Aristotle says of Anaxagoras and Empedocles: rbv uyev (Anaxagoras) aTreLpa rd re 6iotoiol-epr Kai rdvavria, r6v 8e (Empedocles) ra KaXovgAeva oaroLXEla (Physics 187 A 25-26). Burnet and others have translated rd re oItoio/jep) Kcai rdvavria as "both the homoeomeries and the contraries." This translation cannot be correct. The point of Aristotle's argument is that all the Presocratics made the contraries principles (Physics i88 A I9) and the context shows clearly that the contraries are the only products of Anax- agoras' mixture with which he is here concerned. In the phrase, -rd re ouLLotoepri KaI rdvavrTa, he is defining the homoeomeries by hendiadys. The purpose of the whole clause in which it stands is to distinguish Anaxagoras and Empedocles with regard to the number of their contrary principles; the homoeomeries (i.e. the contraries) of Anaxagoras are infinite, but the elements of the latter are finite in number. A few lines later Aristotle says that, according to Anaxagoras, nothing is purely and wholly white, black, sweet, flesh, or bone, but the nature of each thing is that of which it contains the most (Physics I87 B 4-7). This has been cited in support of the view that Aristotle believes that both the homoeomeries and the contraries are ingredients of particular things (G. Vlastos [Ph.R. LIX (1950) p. 52]). But this statement and the one quoted above are not to be taken together as part of a single interpretation. This statement is part of an entirely different argument which is not concerned with contrariety at all but is directed simply against the infinity of Anaxagoras' principles (Physics I87 A 26- i88 A 18). For the purpose of this argument Aristotle temporarily shifts his point of view and leaves aside the question of contrariety as such. To be sure, he men- tions the contraries white, black, and sweet, but these are not contraries in the sense that was used in Physics 187 A 12-26. They are not now principles of generation, but they are, along with flesh and bone, simply some of the infinite ingredients of the mixture. I37. Metaphysics 989 A 30 - B 6, B 16-21. 138.

He objects that Anaxagoras "failed to understand his own utterance" since he said that generation and destruction are the same as alteration. 142. In De Sensibus, 1-2 and 27 ff. Theophrastus attributes contrariety in sensation to Anaxagoras, apparently finding evidence of this in Anaxagoras' state- ment that all sensation is accompanied by pain (ibid., 29). This, again, is Aris- totelian interpretation. The notion that there is contrast in sensation was prob- ably common among the early philosophers, but it had nothing to do with quantitative change (Cherniss, p. 305, n. 57). I43. Physical Opinions, frag. 4 (= Dox., pp. 479, 17-480, 2 = Simplicius, Phys., p. 27, 23-26). Theophrastus reports that "they say" that Socrates associated with Archelaus, and the doxographers take this to mean that Socrates was the student of Ar- chelaus (Vors., II, pp. 44, 28; 45, 20 and 25-30; 46, 35). Theophrastus does not say what connection there was between the doctrines of the two men, but some connection is certainly intended. Plato, Xenophon, and Aristotle appear not to know that Socrates had any contact with Archelaus. Aristoxenus is alleged to have said that Socrates was Archelaus' lover as well as student (Vors., II, p. 45, 30-32), and it has been thought that the whole story is a piece of scandal started by Aristoxenus. This theory is favored by the untrustworthiness of Aristoxenus' other references to Socrates, but it does not explain why Socrates is linked to Archelaus rather than to some other philosopher. If, on the other hand, Theophrastus' report is prior, it is easy to see how Aristoxenus could have turned the ambiguity of the word "associate" to his purpose. In the Phaedo (96 A ff.) Socrates says that when he was young he had a desire for the investigation of nature but came to the conclusion that he had no capacity for this sort of inquiry. He heard "someone" read from the book of Anaxagoras (97 B-C), and he was delighted to learn of the theory that Mind is the cause of everything. On reading Anaxagoras' book, however, he found that Anaxagoras made no use of Mind but resorted to purely mechanistic explanations (98 B-C). In his disappointment he then abandoned the consideration of physical phenomena and took refuge in propositions (99 E). With this passage should be compared Aristotle, Metaphysics 987 A 32 - B 8. Aristotle says that when Plato was young he became familiar with the Heraclitean doctrine that all sensible things are in constant flux and are therefore unknowable. This doctrine, he says, Plato held to even in later years. Socrates, however, concerned himself with morals rather than with the physical world and sought universals in morals, and he fixed thought for the first time on definitions. Plato accepted this procedure and reasoned that, since sensibles are always changing, definition must be of non-sensibles, which he called Ideas. (Aristotle's 6p,wtuxv, Metaphysics 987 B 3, is apparently meant to render Plato's X6oyovs, Phaedo 99 E 5.) These two passages have a very important feature in common. In both Soc- rates marks a turning point from purely physical speculation toward Plato's ideal I49</page><page sequence="66">John B. McDiarmid theory. For Aristotle this development ends in the discovery of his own formal cause. The position of Socrates with regard to the formal cause is, therefore, analogous to the position of the Eleatics with regard to the efficient cause. As the Eleatics pointed the way to the efficient cause by their realization that the Ionian monists could not account for change, so Socrates pointed the way to the formal cause by his dissatisfaction with purely physical explanations and his shifting of attention to definitions. Theophrastus makes Xenophanes the student of Anaximander in order to express more concretely the doctrinal connection that Aristotle suggests between the Eleatics and the Ionians (see pages II8 f.). So, too, in making Socrates the associate of Archelaus, he has apparently combined the accounts of Plato and Aristotle in such a way as to make explicit the relationship that Aristotle believes to have existed between the earlier materialism and the Platonic ideal theory. If the unidentified "someone" whom Socrates heard reading in the Phaedo was Archelaus and if the incident in the Phaedo is a historical fact, the meeting of Socrates and Archelaus was a critical event in the history of causal theory. But, even if these conditions - both of which are doubtful - be granted, there is no evidence in the Phaedo that Socrates became the student of Archelaus. The- ophrastus is impelled by the belief that philosophy is handed on from teacher to student, and he must therefore fill in the gap left by Aristotle. But in doing so he takes care to point out that he is only reporting what "they say"; and his word "associate," although probably intended to mean that Socrates was the student of Archelaus, is broad enough in sense that it may cover not only the formal discourse of teacher and student but also a casual meeting like that of the Phaedo. (On the basis of Theophrastus' statement, Burnet [ad Phaedo 97 B 8] identi- fies the unnamed reader of the Phaedo as Archelaus, and he sees significance in the fact that, among the physical theories with which the youthful Socrates is said to have been acquainted, the first one mentioned is one that has been attributed to Archelaus by the doxographers [ad Phaedo 96 B 3]. But the doc- trine is not referred to Archelaus, but to "some people"; and, even if the doctrine were solely the doctrine of. Archelaus, it would not follow that Socrates had learned it from him. Furthermore, Socrates is interested in this doctrine before he has learned of Nous. Burnet must then suppose that, during his early study with Archelaus, Socrates learned only physical theory and was unaware of Archelaus' major debt to Anaxagoras.) I44.

Physical Opinions, frag. 5 ( = Dox., pp. 480, 4--48I, 3 = Simplicius, Phys., pp. 22, 26- 23, 20). According to some of the doxographers, the material principle of Xenophanes was earth (Vors., I, p. I24, II-I9). Galen states that this doctrine was not attributed to Xenophanes by Theophrastus. He finds fault with Sabinus for saying that Xenophanes declared earth to be the substance of men. (Physical Opinions, frag. 5a [Dox., pp. 481, 4- 482, 4 = Galen, In Hip- I50</page><page sequence="67">Theophrastus on the Presocratic Causes pocratis de Natura Hominis, XV 25K.]) The censure is not justified for that was Xenophanes' theory (frags. 27, 29, 33). Galen and the doxographers mentioned seem to have confused the cosmological and biological doctrines found in Theophrastus. I49. The account of Xenophanes in this treatise has generally been discredited as a hodgepodge put together under the influence of Aristotle and Theophrastus by a late writer who had no knowledge of Xenophanes' poems and misunder- stood the interpretation by which he was influenced (Dox., pp. io8 ff.; Zeller, I, pp. 624 ff.). K. Reinhardt (Parmenides) suggested, on the contrary, that the treatise does represent Xenophanes' doctrine and that the obviously derivative nature of the treatise is due to Xenophanes' borrowing from Parmenides. This view has been conclusively answered by Jaeger, who points out that, if the treatise is based on Xenophanes' poems, Aristotle cannot have known the poems (The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers, pp. 5I-54).

That it should be treated as part of the Theophrastus fragment is argued by the fact that it corresponds to Aristotle, Metaphysics 986 B 19-21, just as the following sentence, in which Theophrastus is named, corresponds to Metaphysics 986 B 21-24.

More extensive fragments are contained in Alexander and Diogenes Laertius (Physical Opinions, frag. 6 [Dox., p. 482, 5-13 = Alexander, Metaph., p. 31, 7-14]; Physical Opinions, frag. 6a [Dox., pp. 482, I4-483, 7 = Diogenes Laertius, IX, 21-22]). All these sources say that Parmenides was the follower of Xenophanes (Dox., p. 480, 5-6; p. 482, 7-8; p. 482, I4-15). Theophrastus has made history out of Aristotle's parenthetical remark that Parmenides was said to be the student of Xenophanes (Metaphysics 986 B 22. See page 119). (Suidas [Vors., I, p. 218, 22 f.] says that, according to Theophrastus, Parmenides was the student of Anaximander.

The first explanation, he says, is impossible because the atoms are impassive; the second and third are ridiculous because in both cases Democritus must supply the efficient cause. For further criticism of the atomists' failure to give the cause of motion, see Theophrastus, De Sensibus, 52; Aristotle, Physics, 252 A 32 - B 5, 265 B 23-26, De Caelo 300 B 8-II, Metaphysics 1071 B 33-34. 198.

If this sentence is Theophrastus' source, then clearly Theophrastus has misunderstood Aristotle. Aristotle does not mean that each atom is heavier in accordance with the excess of its weight, but that each atom has relative weight when compared with any other (cf. Cherniss, p. 97, n. 412). In fact, Aristotle remarks that none of his predecessors had anything to say about absolute weight (De Caelo 308 A 9-II). Theophrastus himself seems elsewhere to have excluded weight from the char- acteristics of the atoms. Aetius (I, 3, I8; I, 12, 6) makes a point of noting that, while the atoms of Epicurus are distinguished by shape, size, and weight, those of Democritus are distinguished only by shape and size. 221.

The fragment of Theophrastus and the doxographical reports based on it illus- trate again the tendency of the doxographers to develop doctrinal resemblances into biographical data. While Theophrastus merely comments on the similarity between the doctrines of Metrodorus and Democritus regarding the full and the void, some of the doxographers have apparently taken this to mean that Metrodorus was also the student of Democritus (Vors., II, pp. 230, I6-i8; 231, 3-4; 234, 5-6). 226.
