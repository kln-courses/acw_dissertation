<plain_text><page sequence="1">142 Reviews. MYTHS OF THE MODOCS. By JEREMIAH CURTIN. Sampson, Low, Marston, &amp; Co., I913. Cr. 8vo, pp. viii+389. 12S. 6d. n. THIS book is in some ways so valuable that we wish a little more trouble had been taken to increase its value. The Modocs are a small tribe, originally situated in the valley of Lost River, Oregon, but removed thence by the U.S. Government in 1872. In 1884 Mr. Curtin gathered a number of their legends, which are now published with a preface by M. A. Curtin and a few notes. The preface unfortunately tells us almost nothing about the people, save a sketch of their treatment by the whites, which seems to have been abominable. Nothing at all is said of their language, racial affinities, or material culture; no specimens are given of the myths in the original; we are not even told whether Mr. Curtin's informants used their own language or English, although the former seems more probable, and we have no means save internal evidence of judging how literal his version is and whether he has modified any of the tales. The notes consist of a few trite remarks, such as "a beautiful myth. The mind that conceived it was full of poetic thought," and some parallels, not always apposite, together with summaries of some of the stories and several attempts to make out that the bulk of the characters are personified natural forces. There is no glossary, its place being inadequately taken by a translation of the proper names prefixed to each story, and there is no index; neither is there any reference to the existing literature, if any, dealing with the tribe. Hence the reader is continually finding himself in need of some explanation of the numerous local customs alluded to. Thus, we hear several times of polygynous marriages, while on p. 145 we have two men with one wife between them. Also, p. I99, the husband of one sister seems to be ipso facto wedded to the other also. Which of these corresponds most closely to actual Modoc custom ? A birth-tabu affecting the father is several times alluded to; a few words of explanation would be in point. These deficiencies are the more to be regretted because the book is full of interesting material. The time at which the events take place is the remote past before the appearance of the human</page><page sequence="2">Rev'ews. I43 race, frequently referred to as "the people who are to come" or the like. The chief characters in the opening stories are the creator, Kumush, and a great hero, Isis, who after his birth is re-born, somewhat after the manner of Dionysos, from Kumush's knee. Kumush, as is generally the case with savage creators, goes away when his work is done (p. 45). Natural forces play a large part in these and later myths, and are conceived as vaguely human and anthropomorphic. The same applies to the various animals, several myths ending with a curse on some species to the effect that they shall " not be people any more." As usual in such cases, the inconsistencies are glaring. Thus (p. 243), the daughter of Lok, the bear, rejects the attentions of Wus, the fox, because the latter, although in human form, has hairy, i.e. animal, feet. It is a fresh example of the hopelessness of trying to make a sharp dis- tinction between anthropomorphic and theriomorphic strata in primitive myth or religion. Several of the nature myths are also instructive, as they are by no means mere allegories of natural phenomena. Thus, the second tale gives an account of a character called Gaukos (Moon) who runs away from his sister (? Day), but meets en route with a number of adventures which it would be hopeless to try to identify with any actual phenomena connected with the moon. Several times the animals, on the other hand, display characteristics which suggest close connection with the heavenly bodies; e.g. it is a bear devouring the moon which causes it to wane (p. 82). Several interesting myths deal not with the creation but the modification of natural phenomena; e.g. (pp. 60 et seq.) the comparative mildness of the weather at present is accounted for by the killing of five out of the ten Sun-brethren,- five is a mystic number and has a magical or religious significance in several passages. P. 77, the same or a similar result is achieved by the slaying of the North and South winds, leaving only their spirits. The latter, however, are invariably conceived of as differing comparatively little from the living person. A number of familiar folk-tale themes appear, such as the clever youngest brother or sister (passim), the swan-maiden (p. I27), and the powers of the name or the word in general. Some are rather less well-worn; e.g. on pp. I39-140 a variant of the external soul is found in the case of a fox-hero who leaves his body behind,</page><page sequence="3">sending on his skin and his mind to attack an enemy. The unspoken thought often acts as a charm, and a few characters can hear thoughts but not words. Several mythical beings appear, more or less common in Indian legend, such as the Stone-people, a one-legged monster who wrestles with all comers, and gigantic spirit-forms. One would like to know what relation, if any, exists between the animal characters and Modoc totems. H. J. ROSE. SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES. 28th Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. Washington, 1912. Royal 8vo, pp. 3o8 + xxxv. 103 pl. + 68 figs. THIS report is mainly concerned with the excavation and history of the Casa Grande and neighbouring ruins in Southern Arizona, but also contains (pp. 42-52) a few Pima stories about a cultus- hero regarded as chief of the Casa Grande and including creation and flood tales. L'Art Rustique Franfais. L'Art Provencal. By C. DE DANILO- wicz. Paris: Champion, 1913. 4to, 72 pp. Ill. 3fr. PEASANT arts are receiving much attention on the Continent, and folk museums are becoming numerous there. The great Provencal poet who passed away a few weeks ago devoted his Nobel prize to the Aries Museum, and from its contents have been produced the beautiful illustrations in this very cheap account of ProvenSal peasant art. Amidst the numerous carvings and cultural objects are illustrated masks and figures used at fetes, and there is a short section (xiii.) on amulets and charms. When will our laggard British local museums cease to be gatherings of odds and ends, and become records of local life and art?
