<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heine: Buch der Lieder. By S. S. Prawer. Keller: Kleider machen Leute. By B. A. Rowley. M?rike: Mozart auf der Reise nach Prag. By R. B. Farrell. (Studies in German Literature 1-3. General Editors: L. W. Forster and B. A. Rowley.) London: Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd. [i960] Pp. 64; 47; 62. 6s each. Studies in German Literature comprises a set of six monographs, the first three of which are reviewed here. Since the general editors did not provide for any introductory statement concerning the purpose of this series, we have to rely on the publisher's remark that it is intended to present critical interpretations of major representative works of German literature in a convenient form. With the exception of a study on Goethe's Hermann und Dorothea, this series treats only individual works of the nineteenth century?by Heine, Keller, M?rike, Eichendorff, and Gotthelf. In view of the professional competency and erudition which the studies evidence, the remark on the dust-jacket that they are equally useful for the amateur as well as for the student and teacher is fortunately misleading. In</page><page sequence="2">7o6 Marx addition to their collective pedagogical excellence, these studies represent individually a persuasive British contribution to scholarly research in their respective field and therefore merit individual attention. The first study contains a succinct analysis of Heine's Buch der Lieder. A few well-chosen biographical references, interspersed with critical comments on the most recent Heine research, precede eight chapters on theme, meta phor, imagery, and symbolism. Two additional chapters examine Heine's technical skill of collocation and versification. This well-balanced study is a welcome refutation of a remark made by H. G. Atkins in his Heine biography of 1929, that the English attitude to the Buch der Lieder has been frequently one-sided in its singular praise through distorted interpretations. In the past ?and incidentally, still today?this collection of poems has often been as sessed only in terms of Heine the jilted lover, the apostate, the social outcast or rebel. Consequently, the imagery and symbolism were interpreted from a narrow angle of vision and made to serve a preconceived theory. Fortunately, Prawer rejects the Buch der Lieder as a source for psychoanalytic or sociolog ical study and considers it the accomplishment of a "great and original poet," as one of Heine's "least polemical productions." To be sure, the historical per sonage is not eliminated as a factor in the analysis of his art. Especially in the case of Heine's scintillating and paradoxical artistry, the author is almost impelled to elucidate the poet's complex susceptibility and vacillating atti tude toward society and religion. In the chapter "Heaven and Hell," Prawer doubts, perhaps in somewhat too categorical terms, the presence of any genuine religious sentiments in the Buch der Lieder. He maintains that in the poems "Die Wallfahrt nach Kev laar" and "Frieden," the Judeo-Christian beliefs have been reduced to a "convenient source of mythological ornament." Since Jehovah is dead and replaced by a cult of Venus, any invocation of a spiritual deity involves no personal allegiance for the younger Heine. Thus, according to Prawer, it is blasphemy which provides the poet "with an exhilarating though illusory sense at once of daring and freedom." But do Heine's numerous cynical disa vowals of hypocritically professed religious values or his rejection of an au thoritative middle-class pseudo-god add up to a total repudiation of faith? Is blasphemy a reputable terminus technicus in literary criticism? Cogent arguments are presented for Heine's anthropomorphic concept of nature. After examining in detail several lines characteristically depicting landscapes and seascapes, Prawer concludes that nature images serve "only as a starting point ... for human experience." The three subsequent chap ters, inquiring into origin and significance of "Masquerade," "Divided Self," and "Play of Wit," are the best in the book. The many images of masquerad ing in the Buch der Lieder are expertly interpreted as a means of escaping a stupid society, to which Heine himself provided a commentary in the Briefe aus Berlin: Mensch ist man erst recht auf dem Maskenball, ... wo das schlichte Du die urgesell schaftliche Vertraulichkeit herstellt . . . und wo die sch?nste Freiheit herrscht? Maskenfreiheit. A selected bibliography and a helpful index to titles of poems discussed in the book complete this stimulating and thoughtful study.</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 707 Gottfried Keller's popular novella Kleider machen Leute is examined by B. A. Rowley. After a short introductory chapter, the author proceeds to a penetrating interpretation of "Structure," "The narrator and his language," "Description and symbol," "Plot, character and themes," and "Fact and fable." The chapter on "The narrator and his language" is arresting for its emphasis and utilization of modern literary theory. Rowley surveys within the confines of a few pages the central problem of narrative method: the complex relationship of author to his work (Erz?hlhaltung). He interpolates between Keller and his novella a fictional narrator who assumes the role of a nonomniscient storyteller, thus keeping "author and narrator . . . onto logically distinct." This modern interpretive technique, so expertly expounded by Wolfgang Kayser in "Wer erz?hlt den Roman" (in Die Vortragsreise. Studien zur Literatur [Bern, 1958]), has become an integral part of the New Criticism. Since its theoretical concepts are rather difficult to comprehend, they are a potential source of confusion to the uninitiated. For example, the reference to the interpolated narrator as "a fictional character like any other" might easily be confused with a fictional storyteller in a Rahmenerz?hlung and thus not be thought of as an interpretive device. Since non-omniscient narration is, however, relatively rare in Kleider machen Leute, it might be more perspicuous within the general pedagogical context of this series, to explain these infrequent occurrences as an epic privilege used by nineteenth-century novelists to achieve tension and suspense (Spannungsmoment durch bewu?ten Verzicht auf erz?hlerische Allwissenheit) or possibly as an extension of the paternal attitude, of which Keller was so fond. Nevertheless, despite the ap parent limitation in nomenclature, the application of modern literary tech niques to a nineteenth-century prose work adds an original point of view and enriches intellectually the comprehension and appreciation of this novella. One deplores that no references were made to any works of literary theory in the otherwise very useful selected bibliography. This short informative study, written with sympathetic insight and conviction, contributes, beyond an expert analysis of subject matter, a glimpse of a scholar using modern tech niques as critical tools. M?rike's prose masterpiece Mozart auf der Reise nach Prag is R. B. Far rell's subject. An expanded "Genesis of the work" is amplified with biograph ical data and critical commentaries. In the following chapter, the novella's basic theme is stated: "The power in life, which, flowing full, manifests itself as intensive creativity and wreaks inexorable destruction on him in whom it appears." This basic conflict between the abundance of life on one hand and artistic creation on the other is then traced as a recurring motif in the action of the novella and finally examined in its effect on structure and style. The motif of dissonance is lucidly presented in the interpretation of the symbolic content. The author refers critically to several other studies of the novella and apparently steers a middle course between Hermann Pongs' overstatement of the daemonic and Franz Mautner's concentration on Bieder meier elements. Benno von Wiese's thesis that the novella exhibits at first a candid affirmation of life and only subsequently reveals an ominous presenti ment of approaching death, is evidently challenged by Farrell's concomitant</page><page sequence="4">7o8 LoCicero view that serenity and harmony are intertwined with tension and despair from beginning to end. The dual motifs?Farrell calls them bright and dark?are continuously present throughout the novella; they emerge structurally in the exposition, descriptive action, and configuration, and stylistically in the form and diction of the work. In the limpid interpretation of the orange-peeling incident, Konstanze's story about her husband, and Mozart's own tale of the Neapolitan ball game, Farrell stresses that the symbolic content is always related to the basic aim of the novella, "... to portray creative activity actually in progress" and to present "the artist in action." In contrast to several other studies of Mozart auf der Reise nach Prag, Farrell does not connect the novella thematically with the Romantic period only; he uncovers several parallels and contracts to Thomas Mann's repre sentation of the artist in society. As a result, the novella is placed within a more modern constellation. Farrell concludes his perceptive study with an up-to-date selected bibliography. In sum, the three studies are rewarding and original contributions. They are to be recommended not only to students for their pedagogical value, but to all Germanists for their individual scholarly persuasiveness. Werner Marx University of Illinois</page></plain_text>
