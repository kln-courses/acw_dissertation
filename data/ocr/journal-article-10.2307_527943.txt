<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HEBREW TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8, COMPARED WITH THE DIFFERENT ANCIENT VERSIONS.* By EIJI ASADA, PH.D., Professor of Old Testament Literature in the Aoyama Methodist Seminary, Tokyo, Japan. I. INTRODUCTION. The purpose of this thesis is to compare the Hebrew text of the first eight chapters of Zechariah with the ancient versions, and to examine the variations presented in the versions. In the presentation of the results, I have received suggestions from Workman's The Text of Jeremiah, and from Patterson's The Septuagint Text of Hosea. But I have tried, as far as possible, to consider the nature of every variation more carefully than Workman did, and to classify the variations more logically than Patterson. It is not the purpose to write a commentary on the book or notes upon the text, but simply and concisely to pre- sent the variations in the different versions and classify them according to their probable origin. Consequently there is no attempt made to explain all technical names and expressions com- mon in the works of textual criticism. The most important of all the versions is the Septuagint, and I have examined it more carefully than any other version. The LXX. of Zech. 1-8 seems to be the work of one man, per- haps different from the translator of the remaining chapters of the book. The translation is a very careful and excellent presen- tation of the original. But it is less literal than the LXX. trans- lation of other portions of the Old Testament, and presents many interesting variations. There are cases of suggestive additions, of careless omissions, of free paraphrase, and of unintelligible translation. The next in importance is the Vulgate, which gives a very accurate and faithful translation of Zech. 1-8, and con- * A Dissertation presented to the Faculty of the Graduate School of Arts and Literature of The University of Chicago, May 1, 1893, in candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. 173</page><page sequence="2">174 HEBRAICA tains fewer variations than the LXX., the Peshitto or the Targum. Therefore, it seems that the MSS. used by the Latin translator were not much different from the MSS. underlying the present Massoretic text. The Targum Jonathan of these chapters, like all other Targumim, is full of paraphrases and interpretations. But it furnishes many important suggestions, and, in a few cases, gives a better reading than that of the Massoretic text. The Peshitto of Zech. 1-8 is also useful for textual criticism. True it is that the Syriac translation is, in general, free, obscure, and inaccurate; but many of its variations are to be accepted in preference to the Massoretic text. Besides these four chief ver- sions the Arabic version has been consulted, which differs but little from the LXX., and the valuable translations by literal Aquila, cautious Theodotion and clever Symmachus. LITERATURE. For the constitution of the text the following books and editions have been used and consulted: Baer and Delitzsch's edition of the Hebrew text, Tischendorf's sixth edition of the Septuagint, and the texts of the other versions as found in the London Polyglot, Origen's Hexapla, and Stier-Theile's Polyglot. Some of the works constantly consulted are: Driver's Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel. C. H. H. Wright's Zechariah and his Prophecies. W. H. Lowe's "Zechariah" in Ellicott's O. T. Commentary for English Readers. A. Kohler, Die Weissagungen Sacharjas, chap. 9-14, Erlangen, 1861-2. Hitzig-Steiner's Die zwOlf Kleinen Propheten. T. W. Chambers' "Zechariah" in Lange's Commentary. Maurer's Commentarius in Vetus Testamentum. Driver's Introduction to the Literature of the 0. T. Keil's Minor Prophets. Briggs' Messianic Prophecy, etc. For the sake of convenience and simplicity, Syriac and Arabic words are written in ordinary Hebrew characters. VARIATIONS IN GENERAL. Variations are numerous, interesting and, in some cases, extremely peculiar. There are many cases in which the readings differ in respect to the tense of a verb. For instance, the trans-</page><page sequence="3">THE TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8 175 lators give the present tense for the past (1:6 in LXX.), the past for the future (8:3, in Vulg.), the future for the past (7:13; 8:10 in LXX.), the future for the present (1:5 in LXX.), the present for =, with participle (8:7 in LXX.), etc. The ver- sions present also a few changes in regard to the person and number of a verbal form; e. g., plural for singular (2:17 in Tar- gum), 3d pers. for 1st pers. (2:15 in Pesh.), 1st pers. sing. for 3d pers. plur. 8:8 in LXX.), 3d pers. plur. for 1st pers. sing. (2:15 in LXX.), etc. It may be noted also that a finite verb is given for a participle (1:8; 2:7 in LXX.), a participle for a finite verb (2:17 in Pesh.), a finite verb for an indefinite (1:14, 17; 8:21 in Pesh.) an imperative for an infinitive (3:4 in LXX.), etc. Not infrequently the translators change the form or construc- tion of a noun, violating etymological or syntactical principles or disregarding the sense of the passage and its relation to the con- text. The genitive is translated by the accusative (1:17 in LXX.), the nominative by the accusative (7:2 in LXX., Vulg., Targ., Pesh.), the accusative by the nominative (7:7 in LXX., Vulg., Pesh.), the vocative by the accusative (2:11 in LXX.), etc. The plural is given in translation for the singular in the Hebrew (4:12; 7:5 in LXX.), the absolute state for the construct state (7:9; 8:16 in LXX.), a proper noun for a common noun where it was difficult to translate (6:14 in Vulg., Targ.), a com- mon noun for a proper noun not familiar to the translator (7:2 in LXX., Pesh.), and a proper noun for another (5:11 in LXX., Targ., Pesh.; 7:2 in LXX.). A proper noun is sometimes mis- taken for a verbal form (6:10, 14 in LXX.), and in one case an untranslatable foreign word is translated, and that of course inex- actly (5:6 in LXX.). The pronoun also suffers from various changes. For instance, 2d pers. is given for 3d pers. (3:8 in Pesh.), plural for singular (5:5 in Targ.), an interrogative pronoun for another (5:5 in Targ.), etc. In one instance a cardinal number is rendered by an ordinal (1:12 in LXX. and Vulg.) In some cases one part of speech is given for another, e. g., a finite verb for a noun (1:3 in LXX.), an infinitive for a noun (4:7 in LXX.), a noun for a verb (7:3 in LXX.), etc. The form of a sentence is often</page><page sequence="4">176 HEBRAICA changed, e. g., the Hebrew declarative is rendered as an interrog- ative (1:6 in Vulg.; 8:6 in LXX., Vulg., Eng., Pesh. [ ?] ), and vice versa the interrogative translated as a declarative (1:12 in Vulg.), the interrogative is turned into the imperative (1:6 in LXX.), the declarative into the imperative (6:8 in Targ.), etc. Besides these, there are a great many more difficult and per- plexing variations. The addition and omission of letters, words, phrases, and sentences is very common; and their causes are various. We find also a few inadequate substitutions, and, in some cases, unnecessary repetitions. The arrangement of letters and words is often changed, and a new construction is given. Inaccurate or free translations are occasionally given, and the readings in the original text are obscured. All these variations may be classified in two groups: (1) Vari- ations due to the translators, and (2) variations due to the manuscripts. In the first division, I include those additions, omissions and variations of every other kind, for which the trans- lators are responsible; and under the second I classify those variations which existed in the MSS. used by the translators, those which are due to the condition of the MSS., and those which had their origin after the work of translation had been done; (3) variations of doubtful origin. In respect to some variations, I have found it extremely difficult to determine to which class they properly belong. It seems to be better to leave such variations unclassified than to attempt to theorize concerning their origin on the basis of mere conjecture. Therefore, I group them together under a third head as doubtful cases. I. I. VARIATIONS DUE PRESUMABLY TO THE TRANSLATORS. 1. Variations arising from a different pointing.-For  (1: 8) LXX. seems to have read 2h7: with Dagedh in the b, and renders rTwV KaraaKLdV. Pesh. follows this and translates bit7t . ?Keil says that 22 is the form for "shady place." Ftirst compares the word with )-0. BOttcher would read "=*2Z.

Variations arising from a different grouping or transpo- sition of words.-Some of the variations in this class are inten- tional changes made by the translators, and a few are due to the corruption of the text. But most of them seem to be due to the careless and hasty work of the translators. In 1:5 Pesh. connects C"N=,71 with the preceding sentence, and destroys the beauty of the Hebrew parallelism.-Pesh. places ~-N (1:11) immediately after ')11, but the Massoretic order is to be preferred.- 1V (at the beginning of 1:17) is connected by LXX. with the preceding verse.-In 2: 6, Pesh. transposes the words t'= and WPa, but other versions agree with the Hebrew. - Pesh. places "t=U (3: 2) at the beginning of the address, i. e., immediately after twM ? .-For =T1 (68:11) Vulg. reads = I?"T .- In 8:13 Pesh. places 1W1 1N at the end of the verse, and spoils the rhetorical beauty of the whole passage (8:9-13) which, in the Hebrew, ends as well as begins with the same words, 1t3' 1"oPM-V .-In 8:15, Vulg. transposes wP'11 ri and '1 ". M2 Ah . 3. Variations arising from ignorance, disregard, or an unsuccessful presentation of Hebrewo idioms, or from a viola- tion of Hebrew syntax.-While some allowance must be made for the difference of idioms and syntax in different languages, one cannot overlook those variations which could have been avoided, if the translators had been more faithful to the original text. LXX. attempts to give the force of the cognate accusative (Sp . . .

But the Heb. is more idiomatic and therefore preferable.- LXX. renders lt.Y (1: 8) by aTT7Kfter , which is less vivid than the original.--For 'It lt ~ '1 MT (1:12), LXX. gives Toro UiPopJ~SpKor"TV T0o9. Vulg. follows LXX., and translates "sep- tuagesimus annus." But in view of Targ., Pesh., and the Heb., we must reject the LXX. reading, which does not suit the context so well.-Targ. renders " =l (1:17) by 'h . This is impos- sible, because the verb is not followed by the preposition 5, but by =.-For ~ ,'1i (3: 4), LXX. gives Kal v8VqarTc, and fails to express the peculiar force of the perf. s h, followed by ==?nM (cf. Harper, Hebrew Syntax, ? 28, 4, a). Targ. and Pesh. pre- sent the sense of these words fairly well, though they weaken the original force. Wellhausen reads )= M'1.-For I t= MT 1 17T2'nNM "72"i (4:14) LXX. gives ovTOL of 80 vot T 7~j 7TL0Or17To rapEcTrvKaot. This rendering would be for  1R " j3 'W V3 itY.--For MMRCZ (5:2), LXX. has 7,xcwv, and Vulg. "cubi- torum," both of which renderings fail to express the force of the preposition 2. Targ. and Pesh. omit the preposition altogether. - For ~r212' r'1 (6: 5), LXX. gives KropevovTraL rapar7vat ; Vulg. "egrediuntur ut stent"; Pesh. 'l1 2 p1'1. But all these versions utterly fail to give the original meaning.--For  pH (6: 8), LXX. gives the extremely literal translation y"v foppa.-- l~'UY (6:11), plural in form and singular in sense, is incor- rectly rendered by LXX. c anTvvovq; Vulg. "coronas"; Arab. b"RtXN. Targ. gives the compromising translation 1' , but Pesh. has the simple  . The same word in 6:14 is again taken by Vulg. as plural, but by LXX. as singular. See Well- hausen, 179, on this verse.-In M X* i' (7:7) LXX., Vulg. and Pesh. disregard MR and take =21'M" as the subject of the verb "to be" understood. Wellhausen reads '*X for MR. -Vulg. renders =t= (7: 12) by "cor suum," failing to express the collective idea of the pron. suffix in the original.-LXX. renders n:~S "'Y (8: 3) by rdXe s&amp;X,tv without the article. Wright translates "a city of the truth," without ascribing the absence of the article to the syntax of the construct state. But Targ. has 1P ~ RVp.--~ p M'I (8:3) is rendered by LXX. Vpos ~"yov without the article. But Targ. and Pesh. give the correct translation y t'ip R't.</page><page sequence="7">THE TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8 179 4. Variations which may be ascribed to carelessness and inaccuracy of the translators.-Under this division may be included many of the omissions and additions of unessential par- ticles, conjunctions, adverbs, pronouns, etc. For instance: The LXX. XE~y for t b (1:3, 4, 16; 2:9, 10, 14; 3:9, 10; 5:4; 8:6, 11, 17) loses sight of the peculiar force of the original word The Targ. ~i, and the Syr. "It_ are better.--R (1:4) is omitted both by LXX. and by Pesh., but the general tone of such an earnest request as expressed in the passage favors its presence. For 3'1 (1: 10; 4:5; 6:5), Pesh. gives A= without the conjunc- tion before it.- LXX. omits MiR (1:12) and fails to present the emphatic force in the original.--For TNMA (1:14), Pesh. gives Stal, which, of course, is wrong. So also in 1:17.--In 2:17, Pesh. renders '1 by " it.- - M (3:9) is omitted by LXX. -- ;i (4:2) is omitted by Pesh.--In 4:6 "1 and 'I7 (twice) are omitted by Pesh.-Pesh. renders YRW1 (4:11, 12) without the conjunction and destroys the idiomatic Hebrew.-- p3_' i (4:12), which is the noun-predicate of ?iMR, is connected by Pesh. with 111'IM2, confusing the gender. Symmachus also presents this error.-~AT (5:7) is omitted by Pesh.-In 6:3 Vulg. read = SXt? ~'7 3.*-The second '17b in 7:3 is omitted by Pesh.-For M" (7:13), LXX. incorrectly gives Kal IrmaT. This error affects the LXX. translation of the following verbs.-Vulg. transposes "'1 in 8: 9.-From 13h h7 (8: 14), Pesh. omits Rb and renders r'pi'bl. (So in London Polyglot, but Lee's edition has NR).--From =' V~ '= (8:20), Pesh. omits I and takes =~Vi " = as appositive to = 11=.-In 8:21, Pesh. seems to have read '17:~H 1 for "'it . 5. Obscure rendering and the omission of difficult words.- In many cases, the translators attempt to give the general sense of a passage, in which they find some word or words too difficult to render literally. This brings forth an obscure and sometimes unintelligible translation. It seems to be more common to omit difficult words altogether than to give an uncertain translation of them. Pesh. renders  ~ (1:8) simply by M*R, and hesitates * On 6:3 see especially Lagarde, Nominal-aIbersicht, 29 rm. LXX. *ap6o, Targ. 1=1 p, of ashy-gray color.

LXX. translates regularly by 6prl (cf. 6:1).-In 6:3, Pesh. seems to feel the difficulty connected with V2=2M, and omits the word altogether. Cf. 6:7.-In 6:14, Vulg. renders M7 by " et Hem," and Targ. also takes it as a proper name. But Pesh. omits the uncertain word M, and substitutes 8N~1 W0ISY= 1=. Cf. v. 10.--72 (7:2) part of a proper name, is ren- dered by LXX. and Pesh. as a common noun; 6 'paotXc, I; . _- 11J . ... 1ni (8:3) is differently rendered by translators. Pesh. does not seem to be sure about the tense of these verbs, and avoids the difficulty by rendering both by the participles 8N2t and N0'.-- ~' ?iMN b b t hN (8:17) is difficult in construction. LXX. renders TraQra vrTra ldo'y'a, Theodotion adds B before dplaqoua. Pesh. follows the LXX. Vulg. and Targ. have tried to translate the 'I=N, but have failed to give the force of %R. On the other hand, LXX. and Pesh. have preserved the original construction of 0i?X t MR, and consequently neglected the word IT .--The meaning of =121] P VI2 &amp; MM 12 1' 't 12e31Y1 &amp; M (8:19) must have been very obscure in the mind of the LXX. translator, for he renders vJr~Era 1 rterpah Kal vyr7eta y ,rreTrr/, vyTarty EflpsOyl Kat vfTlta t` 7 Kaflry. But Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion understand the correct meaning, and translate rather inexactly vvorda i 70ty roraprov, Katl 70 E rr/TTrov, Ka TO to; '/sdLOV, KaK 7~ TO 8cKVTOv.- FOr "a "' (8: 20), Pesh. has b it, but LXX. omits "I1b. To avoid the difficulty, Henderson supplies 'M171 between the two words. 6. Explanatory additions.-When the translators think the original to be too concise, too elliptical, too figurative, too obscure or too anthropomorphic, they supply some words or phrases by way of explanation. After  Zi ='772 (1:1) Pesh. adds the phrase RMY2 liZ. This seems to be quite a common phraseology of the prophets (cf. Ezek. 268:1; 31:1; Hag. 1:1, et al.), and it would not be unreasonable to suppose that the phrase may have existed in the original text. Kohler suggests that the word "TIM means the day of the new moon, i. e., the first day of the month. But it is doubtful that "the first day of the month" should mean more than "the beginning of the month." Therefore, the phrase seems to</page><page sequence="9">THE TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8 181 be an explanatory gloss; and even if it was in the original, we must be grateful to the editor for omitting it.-Before d2, (1:15) Targ. inserts ~Yt . , but this reading is not supported by other versions.--Before RT (1:17) LXX. adds the extra sentence Ka~L e E7Z P ~ p ~ ,yycXos 6 XaXwjV gv CVot. But this insertion seems to be out of place.-Vulgate explains 'l~ (2:4) by the additional phrase, "per singulos viros."- After *bt (2: 8) LXX. supplies XEowv, which is unnecessary. -After "trtit (3:3) Pesh. adds 1ll , and makes its favorite phrase.--In 3:4, Pesh. gives RNbtt as the subject of "1.--For .~ (3:5) Targ. and Pesh. seem to have read either t' l~ -172 or =':I t~I 2. Wellhausen, 176: bei t317=, vermisst man das adj.

" 01p t S'Ia itD . 7. Double translation.- The translator gives, side by side, different renderings of single words, when he is not quite sure of the original meaning. For example: In 1:8, for piw LXX. gives Kal 4/apo~ Ka~L tOrK/XOL, which would show that the translator himself did not know the exact meaning of the word. Cf. 6:3. 8. Variations arising from misunderstanding or misinterpre- tation of a word or passage.- For IV "= (1:1) LXX. gives viv 'AS's, thus making M ZT and 1'. I2 stand in apposition. The translator seems to have taken Zechariah not as grandson of Iddo, as in Vulg., but simply as his descendant. So also in 1:7. Lowe, however, inclines to take the vov as a corruption of vioi.--M7 ZRl22 occurs forty-four times in the first eight chapters, and eight times in the remainder of the book of Zechariah (1:3, three times, 4, 6, 12, 14, 16, 17; 2:12, 13, 15; 3:7, 9, 10; 4:6, 9; 5:4; 6:12, 15; 7:3, 4, 9, 12 twice, 13; 8:1, 2, 3, 4, 6 twice, 7, 9 twice, 11, 14 twice, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23; 9:15; 10:3; 11:5; 12:2, 7;</page><page sequence="10">182 HEBRAICA 14: 16, 21 twice). In all but three places, LXX. renders K~vptoU 7ravTOKpdTwOp, and twice K ptLOs T~V SVV4,wv (1:9; 7:4). The Syriac translation bVr-ib corresponds to the LXX. 7ravroKpd?rop. All the attempted translations fail to give the original meaning and are no better than the mere transliteration orafla; (13:2). Vulg. gives "dominus exercituum," which is perhaps the meaning in the original.- LXX. renders 1 rMi (1: 5) by crovrat, and this is followed by Vulg. which gives "vivent." But the context requires the present tense, which is well expressed in the Hebrew.- Vulg. takes the whole of 1:6 as a question, but LXX. changes the inter- rogative sentence in the verse into an imperative sentence with the verb s8xca0c.-For n"12 (1:6) LXX. gives i7vrAXoat without any sufficient reason. -For 1'~1 1 (1:6) LXX. incorrectly gives KaL a7rCKptO91av.-M-ni'/T II (1:12) is rendered by LXX. a 4*sepetcps and by Targ.*15 j'lY XR11Yt'. But Vulg. and Pesh. agree with the Hebrew.- Vulg. translates 1il : ' = t (1:12) by "Iste iam septuagesimus annus est," and does not include the sentence in the question introduced by rit 'V.-- M21Z (1:17) is incorrectly rendered by Pesh. phe; Targ. hth ; LXX. 8taXvro'ovratL; but Vulg. gives the correct translation "affluent."- Targ. fails to give the original sense of 2:11.-For =T2e (3:8) Pesh. has ~i ', which is not supported by any other version. -i ~* (3:8) is certainly a difficult word. LXX. ren- ders 'AvaroXi.v; Vulg. "Orientem "; and Pesh. WRt'. These trans- lators either take the word as an equivalent of Syr. RKt,, or read h~tT c ; cf. Zech. 6:12, Isa. 4:2, Jer. 23:5, 33:15. Aquil. renders the word by aval4vy, and Symm. by 8fXka-rTya. The last two seem to express the original most satisfactorily. -For him M(rZ (3:9), LXX. gives dpV'Taaw o pov, probably reading ~r~; Aquil.

None of these readings seem to be better than the Hebrew, which is followed by Vulg. and Symm.-For '11=: (3:9) LXX. gives gqXaol4ow, and this is followed by Pesh. -LXX. seems to regard 't  (4:7) as an Aramaic infinitive from the root 'Z", and renders 7ro KaRopOWoaR. But this word is undoubt- edly a noun, as we find WRT'XI* in Targ. and RM pS 11t kRh in Pesh.; an imperative form of has probably been omitted before I . .-- 181 1M (4:10) is rendered by Targ. a';</page><page sequence="11">THE TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8 183 "TrlM 't and by Pesh. 1T'II l'MI.--For * t bk (4:10) LXX. gives T7O XlOov TOv Ka(To(TrLTLVOV; Aquil.

II. VARIATIONS DUE PRESUMABLY TO THE MSS. 1. Errors made by the copyists of the versions.-In this class I include those errors which are due not to the original Hebrew text, or to the translators, but to the copyists of the text of a translation. (a) Addition: For 1211 (7:11), Vulg. has "et averterunt," which seems to be, as Wright suggests, a mistake of the copyists for "et verterunt." (b) Omission: For =V1i ~ tt (8:7), some Codd. of the LXX. have simply 8vac-v, but others add qMXov.- In 8:13, LXX. has 4 o'TKo 'Iosa xal ot~ol 'IorpapX. The omission of the article before the second OdTos is to be taken as a copyist's error. (c) Repetition: For ''lil (7:12), LXX. has ros v-4Lov 1ov. The Aov seems to be a repetition by mistake of the latter part of the preceding word, vo'ov.</page><page sequence="16">188 HEBRAICA (d) Alteration: For IV5 T n'M (1: 6), LXX. gives oL KarTEX- foooav. But it seems to be a corruption of o' KarckX/oorav. 2. Errors due to the condition of the texts used by the translators.- That the texts used by the translators were in quite bad condition is evident from the existence of those pecu- liar variations which could not have arisen, if the writing had been clear, full, and exact. Some of the causes of these variations are: (a) Omission of the final t:. "According to Lagarde, the three letters M, t, t, when occurring at the end of a word, were not written in the MSS. used by LXX., but represented by the mark of abbreviation (") which already appears on Hebrew coins." (Driver's The Books of Samuel, Introd., p. lxix). In my examination of Zech. 1-8, I have found at least one variation due to the omission of the final =.-For t lti ' V (1:17) LXX. and Pesh. read tl tt M, and Targ. t1t * 'IZ . It is possible that the ". of 1%.t originally belonged to "'I , but it is more probable that the final t was omitted, as usual, in the original MSS.; and LXX. and Pesh. seem to present the correct reading. (b) Confusion of consonants. Considering the condition of the ancient MSS. used by the translators, and also their method of translation, it is not at all improbable that some consonants were confounded with others. In some cases the confusion seems to have arisen from a similarity in form, and in others, from a similarity in sound. For 1' MMh (2:4) LXX. reads 1 M75 and renders 70o dovevat. Schleusner thought that the LXX. translation has simply given the sense of the passage. But Vulg., Targ., and Pesh., though they do not give exact equivalents of the word, seem to have intended to translate 1 M,, which is certainly the correct reading.- The confusion of ,M. with ' is quite common. In 2:6, LXX. fails to give the suffix of .SI@.1. In 3:9, M;iM is rendered by LXX. without the suffix. In 4:2, LXX. and Pesh. again omit the suffix from ,7*. In 4:11, LXX. and Targ. do not give the suffix of ~.12~. Again in 5:2, LXX. omits the suffix from M.7 . . . 'n. There is one case in which M is taken for ., viz: in 4:3, LXX. reads '.jl*M for *?M . Wellhausen, 177: "for i. .' read  , the suffix referring to</page><page sequence="17">THE TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8 189 Milti' ; cf. 11; 5M is a false paraphrase."-For h'if (2:8), LXX. reads M'101, and renders KaraKa~p7ro; Symmachus dr&amp;TELXt'm; Theodotion dass Xar6S. But Vulg., Targ., and Pesh. agree with the Hebrew. Also see Wellhausen, Kleine Propheten, 175.-For 1'1hi :=IRt (2:10), LXX. reads 111'? 1V=IR. Several MSS. and Vulg. read t". This reading seems to be better than the Hebrew, because 1r? 1 =IR simply means "the four direc- tions," and not the actual "winds." Wright, however, does not believe t"R2 to have been the reading of Vulg. or Pesh., and holds that the latter, at least, has probably read D.h. The reading of an original MS. ? for w2 (both being very much alike; see Riehm-Baethgen, Handwdrterbuch, article " Schrift") is very common. Mention may be made here of Hos. 9:7; Amos 5:8, 17; Mic. 1:2; Zech. 2:10; 6:14. This explains satisfactorily the LXX. translation l (= = ) for Heb. . Wellhausen, loc. cit. 175, says: "One would expect something like =%2A:."-For 4. (2:17), LXX. has ,aflatcl0o; Pesh. r'l, and Targ. '1 . These translators seem to have read 1r .- For the second =31 (3: 7), LXX. reads ~1.--For p (5:3), Targ. gives 'Ip, which has perhaps, as Wright suggests, arisen from the confusion of ,pt with T .-For ='1 (5:6), LXX. reads 0117 and renders - 8tKt/a avmrw. Wellhausen, 178, follows LXX. and in addition omits as a gloss 821', rI3 87 nt 'R1. Pesh. seems to follow LXX., and gives WR2?. Symmachus' suggestion rpo Trovro droflXhrov(To is certainly based upon the Heb. =% , but it is not an exact translation.--LXX. renders M',M (8: 10) by Zora,, probably reading ''. Lowe thinks, however, that the LXX. translator read ~ as an Aramaic future. At any rate, the verb should be taken as a past, as in Vulg., Pesh., and in some MSS. of the LXX. (c) Corruption of the Text. Though the confusion of conso- nants is, in a sense, due to the corruption of the text, yet, under this special heading, I include those strange and remarkable variations which compel me to ascribe them to the fact that the original text was very badly corrupted and obscure. For 1 5 1 (1: 6), Pesh. gives l~in . Perhaps the text was corrupt, but it is possible that the translator read 1i =1.-For it JnRMt (1: 15), Vulg. has "opulentas;" Targ.

This is followed by Targ. But Vulg. and Pesh. give faithful translations of the more vivid original Hebrew.-For 15~1 (2:15), LXX. incor- rectly reads 1=, and renders Kara44GOVTraL.-FOr 1ZL' (2: 17), LXX. gives IK VCOCXv, and Pesh. t17nt. It is probable that the former read (n), and the latter 'Mb:2.-For 'it~' (3:5), LXX. has 07rtc.-t- D'1 t (3:7), a very difficult word, is rendered by LXX. dvaarp~ccop~vov;, by Vulg. "ambulantes," and by Pesh. i. Hitzig's objection to Gesenius' interpretation of the word does not prove that the form is an Aramaic hiph. participle from b'i. Wellhausen, 176: =t?'Ml muss die Bedeu- tung " Zutritt " haben; cf. Jer. 30: 21.- For a't =AI (4:7), LXX. probably reads MIW' " 2W, as Schleusner supposed, and renders Trv XtOov- r1 KX'povo/11aT. Vulg. translates "lapidem pri- marium," and Pesh. also has RH h) "'l . 7MC1. is rendered by Aquila O 7v rpWrCvovra, by Symmachus rov Kpov, and by Theodo- tion r .rparov. Targ. gives the interpretation, 1~Z ' o-Thrr " tipbt MZ) t. Weighing all these translations, we must reject the LXX. reading and adopt the Heb. as the original, though it is very difficult.-- Ib M rlNTh (4: 7) is also very difficult. LXX. seems to have derived the word r'ITrh from M'i, and renders LGdcrYOa XadpLro XdpTra acrr)y. This is followed by Aquila's '$W L- XpLpTro, and the Vulg. "exaequabit gratiam gratiae eius." Symmachus gives 7rp Xadpv av"rn7; Theodotion offers KaardravcrIT, KarcrdavY-sL avT?; Pesh. has Rti'l N11I ' . These translations sufficiently testify to the helpless corruption of the Hebrew text. Wellhausen: "Der Sinn der letzten Worte des Verses lasst sich nur muthmassen."-LXX. renders ~ t'tt (4:10) by ol ~nE- pAXovrC, and this is followed by the Syriac 1 M. But better is the Vulg. " discurrunt," which is adopted in the English Version. * See, however, Wellhausen, loc. cit. 174, and Isa. 37:29. t Wellhausen, loc. cit. 174, suggests 7tLY (cf. 3: 5).</page><page sequence="19">THE TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8 191 -For  (4:12), LXX. seems to have read b32 .-- For h;'11= (5:3), LXX. reads either Mt? or ij~, and renders e&lt;w Oavarov. This, however, may be due to the omission of the final I in the original MSS. Tischendorf's text omits the second i'M. Vulg. has "sicut ibi scriptum est" for the first 1';=~ M , and "ex hoc similiter" for the second. Wellhausen: probably read "Z ~fl (-= Y) "since how long."- For It= 5P (6: 13), LXX. gives (Kal &amp;tratL LEpc) iCK SW) v  avTro.

Recensional variations.- These are the variations which can be best explained by supposing the translators to have used MSS. more or less different from the MSS. on which our Masso- retic text is based. Some of the variations in this class are to be preferred to the Massoretic text, while others should be rejected. We note the following: (a) Errors made by the copyists of the Hebrew text. These are the deviations from the correct Hebrew text, which are solely due to the copyists of the Hebrew text, and which were adopted by the translators. (a) Addition: For I1~ ~ R (1:4) LXX. reads T11 R I.-For ~~M (1:13, 16; 8:17) LXX. reads Mri'MI MR=, Pesh. following LXX. in 1:16 and 8:17.-For nh Z (1:16) LXX. reads n'1 . -After 'ItM (1: 6) LXX. adds ,rp arrov, and is followed by Pesh.

We are either to take these words distributively, or perhaps better to regard the second as a mere repetition by mistake of the first (so Hitzig, Ewald, Henderson). K6hler and Wright conjecture that there are two sets of seven pipes each. Briggs favors this view. But this interpretation does not seem to be more natural than to regard the second iY'VZ as a copyist's error. (Wellhausen, 176-7).-- (8) Explanatory or marginal glosses, which crept into the text: For 7 115 (1:1) Vulg. reads "t- j''', as in Hag. 1:1 and 15.--After "n1 (1: 6) LXX. adds 6v rvcvarlt /tov.

Wellhausen, loc. cit., 175).-For ?1V (3:4) LXX. reads "'t1. Wellhausen considers '1 I2't"N JiV .... as a parenthetical insertion.--For t*' R (4:9) LXX. reads Tbt. This suits the context well, and seems to be the correct reading, though all the other ancient versions favor the Hebrew.-For X n=' (7:2) LXX. Targ., Pesh. and Baer read Rn"t= as one word.-Before "l (7:10) LXX., Vulg. and Targ. add the conjunction I. -Before itab (8:1) many Codd. and Pesh. read "?K. In spite of the objection of the Massorah this seems to be the correct reading in view of 4:8; 6:9; 7:4, 8. III. VARIATIONS OF DOUBTFUL ORIGIN. While there are not a few doubtful cases among the variations which have thus far been discussed, it is even more true of the varia- tions under this special heading, variations which are extremely difficult to explain. Their origin may be accounted for as:</page><page sequence="22">194 HEBRAICA 1. Recensional, or a change made by the translator. For instance: In 2:4,  ltT'p MA is rendered by LXX. rT Ta&amp;'apa KepaTa. The Hebrew is to be preferred. -For I3V (7:2), part of a proper name, LXX. has 'Apflew- p. 2. Recensional, or due to the carelessness on the part of the translator. Note the following examples: For '1 (2:4) LXX. reads ihl".-For 1-For 1 (2:14) Targ. reads 17 121 , and renders '1' 21Rh~. The translator, however, may have been misled by the usual scriptio defectiva in the original MSS. 3. Recensional, or misinterpretation of the translator. Thus: For "bl' (3:5) Vulg. and Pesh. read " R 1, and, as the result, the former gives the duplicate statement that Joshua was clothed with new garments, and both present an unpleasantly abrupt change from the direct imperative 11"Ot to the indirect jussive ZIY . It is best to follow the Heb. and Targ., and read ltt , because it suits the context best and also strengthens the contrast between ? = and  13".-For Z~M1 (7:7) LXX. gives C ipetv ; Pesh. seems to follow LXX. and renders MIlt. 4. Due to the corruption of the text, or an intentional change made by the translator. So we have: In 1:6, LXX. has an additional word eXe0c, which is proba- bly for 1Mp, as has been suggested; and this reading may have arisen from some confusion connected with the word *pi.--For 0 i. (8:22) Targ. has l*i . The translator may have given his interpretation of the original. 5. Recensional, or due to the condition of the text: For VWP2ICt (1:5) Pesh. read "N"=. The absence of the final t: in the original text may have misled the Syriac trans- lator to read .~ for W~ . -For 1'1' (1: 6) Pesh. has 1"'V7 .--For ~V' (1:7) Pesh. gives 11.-In 2:9, Pesh omits j'- and gives ~1~ in its place. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. It is undoubtedly true that some of the explanations offered in this thesis are far from satisfactory. But, taking it for granted that most of them are correct or probable, it may not be uninter-</page><page sequence="23">THE TEXT OF ZECHARIAH 1-8 195 esting to observe some of the characteristic variations in the dif- ferent versions. Most of the variations in the tense of a verb are found in LXX. The changes from one part of speech into another are found only in LXX. and Pesh. Variations due to a different pointing are characteristic of LXX., but those due to a different grouping of words are rare outside of Pesh. LXX. has many additions, but Pesh. has only a few, and Vulg. none. Omissions are most numerous in Pesh., and half as many in LXX., but very rare in Vulg. and Targ. Variations arising from a violation of the principles of Hebrew syntax are found almost exclusively in LXX. Some explanatory glosses are given in Targ. and Pesh., but more in LXX. Obscure rendering is a characteristic of Pesh., and too literal translation is common in LXX. Paraphrase and interpretation are abundant in Targ., but most of the strange, inexplicable variations are found in LXX. Misinterpretations are quite numerous in all versions, but original readings are pre- served more in LXX. and Pesh. than in the other versions.
