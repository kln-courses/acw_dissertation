<plain_text><page sequence="1">Zeami's Confucian Theatre Gary Mathews Buddhism , particularly Zen , is by far the most widely recognized extratheatrical influ- ence on Zeami's drama theory and practice. This article argues that while Zeami draws extensively on Buddhist ideas to conceptualize his performance practices and especially to describe the relations between actor and audience , Confucianism is the fundamental influence on his thinking about nõ. Confucianism establishes the purpose of nõ as a performing art, namely , to promote peace and harmony among the people. To Zeami , the distinctive way that nõ can realize this purpose is by fostering empathy in the audience through their identification with the experience and feelings of the characters on stage. This conviction inspires his lifelong search for the most effective means of engaging the audience in this process of identification. He regularly resorts to Buddhist aesthetic , psy- chological, and philosophical ideas to elucidate those means. But the purpose they serve always retains its Confucian inspiration. Gary Mathews teaches classical languages and literature at North Carolina State Uni- versity. He received his PhD in comparative literature from the University of California , Berkeley , and taught humanities at San Francisco State University and the University of North Carolina School of the Arts before coming to NCSU. He has trained in nõ per- formance since 2000 with Richard Emmert and Kita school master actors Akira Matsui, Sadamu Omura, and Kinue Oshima. Heis a founding member of Theatre Nohgaku, a company whose mission is creating and performing original English-language plays in traditional no style , and a former editor of Theatre Nohgaku 's newsletter In the Noh. The modern reception of Zeami's theoretical writings on nõ in both Japan and the West has paid most attention to their religious-aes- thetic elements, especially those associated with Zen Buddhism. That this should be the case in Japan stands to reason, as Zen has been a cen- tral component of Japanese religious and aesthetic discourse since the medieval period.

For one thing, Zen has exerted a powerful fascination on the Western mind as an alternative to the anthropomorphic and purposive religious concepts that have dominated Western thought since they first took shape in ancient Mesopotamia. For another, no's minimalist, abstract style of presentation, which may seem to give access to truer or more intense spiritual and psychological realities than a more natu- ralistic performance style can offer - a paradox grounded in Zen pre- cepts - appeals to actors and directors seeking to create a more com- pelling dramatic experience than they have found attainable within the prevailing psychophysical realism of Western theatre. On yet another count, the West's fascination with Zen has to do with strains of West- ern thought, both religious and aesthetic, that were already congruent with Zen, for the West has had its own mystical traditions promising a more immediate experience of the sacred than conventional worship can provide, while in the arts an idealism ultimately descended from Platonic thought has often found ways of expressing itself through nonrealistic means.1 By contrast, Confucian elements in Zeami's treatises have been largely neglected. This may seem surprising in the case of Japan, inso- far as Confucianism stands alongside Buddhism and Taoism as one of the three pillars of East Asian thought and practice (with the addi- tion, in Japan, of Shinto) and hence enters in some way into nearly every institution of Japanese life, social, religious, and political as well as aesthetic. But there may be less cause for surprise at this when we reflect that Confucianism has been so deeply embedded in Japanese culture from ancient times to modern that it is often simply taken for granted. As for the West, there ought to be little surprise that in the more popular reception of nõ, at least, such as among performance artists and teachers, Confucianism has received scant attention, for the principles and concerns of Confucian social philosophy are ill suited to gain much purchase on the insistent and often militant individualism of the modern Westerner (and the appeal of Zen is a corollary to this) .2 The lack of attention to Confucianism in Western scholarly discussion of Zeami is more problematic. This neglect has not, to be sure, been absolute. Hare (1986: 233-234) offers some brief but sug- gestive remarks about the importance of Confucianism to Zeami, as an example of how Zeami combines various traditions of thought in forming his ideas. Similarly, Ley (2000: 204) notes, "The intertextu- ality of [Zeami's] treatises is by no means confined to the influence of Zen Buddhism, . . . including as it does quotations from Mencius, Confucius's Analects , and waka poetry." But neither explores the Con- fucian influences in any detail. More recently, in a book-length expli- cation of Zeami's performance theory and practice Quinn (2005: 20)</page><page sequence="3">32 Mathews observes, "In his late work [Zeami] makes liberal allusions to Buddhist and Confucian texts." But she focuses almost exclusively on the Bud- dhist (and related Taoist) sources. At all events, I know of no work that has paid comprehensive attention to the Confucian elements in Zeami's treatises. I wish to argue that a Confucian perspective is actually funda- mental to Zeami's view of the nature and purpose of nõ performance. It is what shaped his understanding of the very reason for being of his art from the beginning of his career as a child under the tutelage of his father, Kannami - namely, to contribute to the peace and harmony of the people by fostering empathy through the process of emotional iden- tification occurring between actor and audience in the performance experience - and what continued to guide his sense of no's purpose to the end. It is true that the many Buddhist and other religious and philo- sophical concepts that he used to explain his theatrical practice from mid-career on ultimately predominated in his technical vocabulary. But that practice always stood in the service of its original Confucian purpose. I hope to show that a commitment to this purpose remained inseparable from the Buddhist (and Taoist) concepts Zeami drew on, that indeed it was what those concepts could offer to the realization of this purpose that made them especially attractive and useful to him.3 Confucianism in No's Development and as Nõ9 s Purpose It was a salient feature of medieval Japanese religious and philo- sophical discourse that Buddhist, Shinto, and Chinese ideas (the latter including both Confucianism and Taoism) were always tightly interwo- ven, so much so that "the unity of the three teachings" ( sankyõ itchi) was an important catchphrase in Muromachi Japan. In its original form in China, this expression referred to Confucianism, Buddhism, and Tao- ism. In Japan, it also came to be applied to Shinto, Buddhism, and "the secular works of Confucius and Lao Tzu" (Thornhill 1993: 34 n. 50) .4 The conjoining of Confucianism and Taoism derived in large part from the fact that the form in which the former was known in Japan in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was Neo-Confucianism. One of the main impulses behind the development of Neo-Confucianism in China during the early Sung dynasty (eleventh and twelfth centuries) had been a wish to give the stringently humanistic focus of the original Confucian teachings a metaphysical dimension similar to that offered by Taoism and Ch'an Buddhism (Japanese Zen).5 It will be important in what follows to bear in mind that Zeami's Confucianism was filtered through a strong Buddhist-Taoist lens, while remaining no less Confu- cian for that. In spite of their copious borrowings from Buddhist and</page><page sequence="4">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 33 Taoist thought, what always distinguished the thinking of the Neo-Con- fucianists was their maintenance of the Master's commitment to social responsibility.6 For all the appeal to unity, distinctions were in fact regularly made among the Shinto, Buddhist, and Chinese teachings in Muroma- chi Japan in at least two important ways. First, there were proponents of one or the other who tried to establish its priority or superiority. For example, the mid-fourteenth-century Shinto apologist Jihen (d. 1347?) used the Buddhist metaphor of honjirsuijaku ("fundamental essence, trace manifestation") to argue for the priority of the kami (Japanese gods) over the buddhas, holding the former to be pure essences and the latter mere traces not free from the defilements of the sensory world (Thornhill 1993: 179-180). Closer to Zeami's time (and place), in the early 1380s the priest Gidõ, while instructing the shogun Ashi- kaga Yoshimitsu in both Neo-Confucianism and Zen, urged him to pre- fer the latter for the sake of the higher truths to be found in it (Var- ley 2001: 195-196). But more important perhaps than such advocacy was that the three teachings were variously applicable as guides to or inspiration for different pursuits or departments of life. A scholar like the Confucian Ichijõ Kaneyoshi (1402-1481), in his commentary on Six Circles and One Dewdrop ( Rokurin ichiro ), a work elaborating Zeami's artistic principles by his son-in-law Zenchiku, might treat Buddhist, Shinto, and Confucian-Taoist ideas as though they were simply differ- ent ways of saying the same thing.7 But for many purposes the three teachings really were about different things, and they were useful in dif- ferent ways. Kaneyoshi himself cites the popular examples of Master Fu (of the Liang dynasty), who "wore a Taoist hat, Confucian shoes, and a Buddhist robe," and Po Chü-i (of the T'ang dynasty) , who "adorned his outward appearance with Confucianism, governed his mind with Bud- dhism, and nurtured a long life with Taoism" (Thornhill 1993: 34-35). In keeping with his ecumenical leanings, Kaneyoshi sees these various applications as expressing the "single flavor of the three teachings" (Thornhill 1993: 34-35). But they clearly point to different kinds of activity, more symbolically in the case of Master Fu, more literally in that of Po Chü-i. Concern with outward appearance refers to Confucian- ism as a guide to one's public comportment, and beyond that to one's social and political obligations, while governance of the mind alludes to Buddhist mental and spiritual self-cultivation. Not that the two could not go together. Indeed, in Neo-Confucianism self-cultivation was tied to social duty. But certain distinctions did remain. To Gidõ, for exam- ple, Confucianism was useful primarily as a guide to the craft of ruling, and secondarily as a path toward the nobler truths and more rigorous mental and spiritual discipline of Zen (Varley 2001: 196).</page><page sequence="5">34 Mathews Similarly, in his commentary on the Six Circles Kaneyoshi himself explicitly ascribes Confucian social and political value to nõ by stressing no's place as a music-based performing art within a program of good governance: "The moral benefits of [no] are the result of sharing music with the people" (Thornhill 1993: 36). Just what benefits derive from musical performance Kaneyoshi scarcely details. But he cites some sug- gestive statements from early Confucian sources, in particular, "There is nothing better than music to transform the habits of the people," from the Classic of Filial Piety (Thornhill 1993: 35). 8 We can get a better idea of what lies behind Kaneyoshi's claim of moral benefit by looking at another, fuller statement about the value of music from the Book of Rites , one of the five Confucian classics: All melody originates from the heart. The external, material world affects one's heart, which then expresses itself through sound That's why the great rulers in the past were careful about the things that affect people. They used li, the rites or etiquette, to guide peo- ple's desires. They used yue, music, to harmonize people's nature. They used zheng t government, to moderate people's behavior. They used xing, penal codes, to guard against people's base inclinations. Li, yue, zheng, and xing share the same ultimate purpose, that is, to pull people's hearts together in creating a peaceful, safe, and stable world. (Fei 1999: 6-7) I will have more to say about the rites and their relation to music below. For now the important point is to note that the purpose of music as a performing art is to act on the feelings in people's hearts so as to create harmony among them for the sake of peace and order in the world. It is exactly this purpose that Zeami attributes to nõ in his first treatise, Transmitting the Flower through Effects and Attitudes ( Füshikaden ) . Indeed, he considers it no's very reason for being: "The performing arts generally exist to mollify people's hearts and create excitement in the high and low; they are the foundation for long-term prosperity and increase, the means of gaining longevity" (Hare 2008: 55). The words "to mollify people's hearts" (yawa-rageru) echo the phrase "to harmonize people's nature" from the Book of Rites, In fact, the character expressing the idea of mollification, ^P (yawa) , has the root meaning of "peace" or "harmony" (when read as wa) . As the Book of Rites suggests, harmony occupies a central place in Confucian thought. Analects 1.12 cites it as the most important product of the rites, the principles and precedents that govern people's behavior toward one another on all occasions: "Of the things brought about by the rites (li, /IH), harmony (hé, ?P) is the most valuable" (Lau 1979: 61). 9 In Japanese, when the character ÍP is used in the verb yawa-rageru, it means, "to mollify," or</page><page sequence="6">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 35 "soften." But the idea of harmony is present insofar as the softening in question makes its object more pliable. In the case of its effect on people, it renders them more ready to enter into peaceful relations with others. There is a further Confucian resonance in this passage from Transmitting the Flower in the words "people" and "high and low." The word Zeami uses for "people," shonin , is actually made up of two char- acters, HiÀ, meaning "various" and "person." The phrase "high and low" ( jõge ) thus refers to all classes of people. This reflects the Confu- cian precept that, even as people's obligations to one another differ according to their class (along with their age and sex), all are bound up in a common web of duties prescribed by the rites. Indeed, they are seen as part of one large family. Notwithstanding that this view has sanctioned a strong paternalistic bias in government throughout the history of Confucianism (Lau 1979: 36-37), the ideal of the harmoniz- ing of all people in society is the core of the social aspect of Confucian morality. With respect to harmony, there may appear to be a contradic- tion in Zeami's statement of no's purpose in Transmitting the Flower between "mollifying" and "creating excitement" in people. But the word translated "excitement," kan (íS), also means "feeling" or "emo- tion." Although Hare consistently translates kan as "excitement," it will often be essential to my argument to note that the excitement in ques- tion is not just a kind of theatrical thrill, such as a reaction to a strik- ing performance turn, but an emotional excitement having to do with identification with the inner world and feelings of the main character {shite). What Zeami regularly means by kan , in the sense of "feelings," are the affects of heart that the Book of Rites refers to. It is by evoking such affects that a performance can "pull people's hearts together" for the sake of "creating a peaceful, safe, and stable world."10 It is in the light of Zeami's statement of no' s purpose in chapter 5 of Transmitting the Flower that we should regard his accounts of the origins of nõ in chapter 4. The first two of these three accounts, which establish ancient Shinto and Buddhist precedents for nõ, are gener- ally taken to be the only ones that confer religious and social author- ity on the art deriving from particular ideological traditions. But the third account is of far greater practical consequence for the realities of nõ performance in Zeami's time. So it is important that it places nõ within a Chinese, and specifically Confucian, context. Looked at from the point of view of this last account, what is striking about the Shinto and Buddhist precedents is the way they comport with the Confucian purpose of creating peace and harmony out of dissent and division. The first precedent comes from the story of how the sun god-</page><page sequence="7">36 Mathews dess, Amaterasu, out of dismay at the offensive behavior of her brother, Susanowo, the god of oceans and storms, deprived the world of light: Sarugaku had its beginning in the age of the gods, when the Great Goddess Amater[as]u secluded herself behind the boulder door in the heavens; she cast the whole world into darkness, so the eight hun- dred myriad gods, gathering together on Mount Ama-no-kaguyama, performed kagura music and for the first time ever used a comic per- formance in order to catch her august attention. Ama no Uzume no Mikoto came forth from among the group and sang and danced with a consecrated branch from the sakaki tree in her hand, her voice raised high, prancing and stomping in the light of bonfires, in order to pro- voke a divine possession. Secretly listening to her voice, the Great God- dess opened the boulder door a little. The land grew light once again. The faces of the many gods shone white. The festivities on this occa- sion were, so they say, the beginning of sarugaku. (Hare 2008: 47, my brackets)11 Though Zeami does not call attention to the point, the mayor impor- tance of Uzume's performance to the story is that it was not just an entertainment but a means by which order and peace were restored to the community of the gods, serving as a model for human society as well. Zeami traces the second precedent for nõ back to India, fashion- ing a story of how the Buddha called for a dramatic performance to calm a band of heretics who had noisily interrupted a sermon he was preaching: In the land where Buddha lived, on the occasion of the consecration of the Jetavāna Monastery built by the rich man Sudatta, the Buddha Säkyamuni was preaching a sermon. Devadatta, in the company of ten thousand heathens, made such a great commotion dancing with fes- tooned branches and sheaves of bamboo grass that it became difficult to continue the consecration. Buddha cast his gaze toward Sāriputra who, thus fortified by the Buddha's strength, prepared a performance with drums and songs at the back entrance to the temple, and there, through the ingenuity of Ānanda, the wisdom of Sāriputra, and the eloquence of Pūrņa, they performed sixty-six acts of dramatic imitation so that the heathens, hearing the sound of the drums and flute, gath- ered at the back door and settled down to watch. Given this respite, the Buddha continued with the consecration. Our vocation found its Indian origins in this. (Hare 2008: 47-48) The common element between this story and the myth of Amaterasu is that a musical and dramatic performance is used as a means of restor- ing peace and order.</page><page sequence="8">Zeami' s Confucian Theatre 37 Immediately after telling these two stories Zeami turns to the Confucian account. It runs as follows: In the land of Japan during the reign of Emperor Kinmei [the legend- ary twenty-ninth Heavenly Sovereign of Japan, reputed to have lived from 510 to 570], there was a great flood along the Hatsuse River in Yamato, and a large jar came floating down the river. A courtier caught hold of the jar near the cedar toni at Miwa Shrine. There was a baby inside. He was gentle and quiet and a perfect jewel. Since this child had fallen from heaven, the event was announced at court. That night, in His Majesty's dream, the baby spoke, saying, "I am the reincarnation of Qin Shihuang of the Great Realm of China. I have a certain affinity for the realm of the sun and am manifest here now." His Majesty took this for a miracle and summoned him to court. As the baby grew older, his intelligence surpassed that of other people, so at age fifteen, he was made a minister and the surname Shin was bestowed upon him. The graph for Shin is also pronounced Hada; indeed, Hada no Kõkatsu was this very child. When there were troubles abroad in the land, Prince Shõtoku [574-622], in accordance with precedent from the Age of the Gods and from the Land of Buddha, called upon this Kõkatsu to perform sixty-six acts of dramatic imitation and likewise had sixty-six masks made, which he gave to Kõkatsu. These acts were performed in the Great Shishinden Hall of the Tachibana Palace. The realm came to order and the country became peaceful. These were kagura perfor- mances, so with a view toward posterity, Prince Shõtoku took the graph shin from the word kagura and removed the radical, leaving only the phonetic element. Read in the context of the calendar, this element is pronounced "saru" so Shõtoku named the performance sarugaku because it "gives voice to" (Í ) "enjoyment" (^c). This is also because it derives from kagura. (Hare 2008: 48-49, my brackets) The historical fact was that the origins of sarugaku lay in China,12 and the story of Hada no Kôkatsu's coming to Japan alludes to this. But further, the occasion and purpose of Kôkatsu's performance point to a Con- fucian function of the art: its use by government officials to promote peace and order. This function has an even more fundamental associa- tion with Confucianism than it has with either Shinto or Buddhism. As seen above, it is put forward as the main official use of musical per- formance in the Book of Rites. It is significant that, rather than regard Kokatsu's performance as an ad hoc solution to a problem on a single occasion, as he does those of Uzume and Buddha's disciples, Zeami presents it as being institutionalized under Prince Shôtoku's patronage "with a view toward posterity." Zeami's statement that Kõkatsu, along with Prince Shõtoku, was a minister in the government of Emperor</page><page sequence="9">38 Mathews Kinmei underscores the place of nõ in Confucian governance that the story dramatizes. This is not to deny that Buddhist and Shinto references alike are strewn liberally throughout this account. These include the "Heav- enly Sovereign" Kimmei, descended from Amaterasu; Miwa Shrine; the number sixty-six, associated with the Bodhisattva Kannon and estab- lished by the Buddha's disciples as the correct number of performance pieces; and the reincarnation and manifestation of the Emperor Ch'in Shih-huang of China as Kõkatsu, not to mention his later career as the Great Luminous Deity Taikõ, object of worship as an avatar of the Buddhist deity Bishamon and defender of the religion by means Zeami refers to using the Buddhist term höben , "skill in means" (Hare 2008: 49 with nn. 46-48). Not only that, but the Japanese and Indian sources of nõ are seen as lying behind the Chinese; indeed, Zeami says that they had established a precedent for Kokatsu's performance. Finally, the pieces performed are said to be of kagura , which was "a body of ancient performance in Japan aimed at placating or summoning the kami (gods)" (Hare 2008: 49 n. 43). This conflation draws sarugaku even closer to its Shinto roots (Uzume's song and dance were thought to be the first performance of kagura) . Nevertheless, there are aspects of this story and its relation to the two preceding that suggest Zeami took no* s Chinese influences to be the most important for its nature and purpose as it was practiced in his time. Despite the reference to kagura as an existing art form employed by Kõkatsu, his acts of dramatic imitation are plainly an inaugural per- formance of some kind. Zeami has Shõtoku assigning them a name of their own, sarugaku , to designate their purpose henceforth as "giving voice to enjoyment." Behind Shôtoku's creation of this name out of a modification of the word kagura may be discerned Zeami' s awareness of a distinction between the two kinds of performance, and his implica- tion that the particular direction sarugaku would take was the result of innovations by Kõkatsu derived from China. The detail that Shõtoku had sixty-six masks made for Kõkatsu to use in his performance fur- thers the suggestion of novelty, if not indeed of a new art form.13 This is not the only place where Zeami puts forward the view that sarugaku developed out of kagura while also stressing its Chinese associations. In the opening section of Talks on Sarugaku ( Sarugaku dangi), the collection of Zeami's reflections on his art recorded by his son Motoyoshi, Zeami repeats his theory that sarugaku originated in kagura singing and dancing alongside a citation from the preface to the Book of Songs, one of the Confucian classics: "To express one's aspira- tions is called poetry" (de Poorter 1986: 80). Zeami takes this to be an inspiration for all poetic arts, as though, regardless of its own origins</page><page sequence="10">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 39 and nature, each art recognizes a general purpose within a Confucian understanding of the place of the arts in people's lives. Confucius's endorsement of the Book of Songs as a guide to expression in every kind of social situation, along with his view that what mattered most in life was all people realizing their aspirations through a balance of individ- ual and collective wants, renders this programmatic statement from the Songs a fundamental Confucian precept.14 The balancing of individual and collective wants depended heavily on people's ability to express themselves clearly to one another, and Confucius thought an important source of this ability lay in the models provided by poetry. Zeami may have this function of the arts in mind in his explanation of Shôtoku's name for Kôkatsu's performance as meaning "giving voice to enjoy- ment," insofar as, along with enjoyment, the arts provide instruction in expression and mutual understanding. This integral role of the arts in Confucian social relations is one that I will return to below. With regard to the order of the three stories of origin, Zeami places them in a chronological progression from mythic and legendary sources to a direct historical antecedent. (While some features of the Chinese account, such as the transmigration of Ch'in Shih-huang and indeed the figure of Kõkatsu himself, remain all or mostly in the realm of legend, Prince Shõtoku stands squarely in the domain of history.) The Amaterasu story reflects an early, shamanic phase of religion,15 characterized by informal rites to avert immediate danger, while the story of Buddha and his disciples reflects a later phase of organized religion, involving the establishment of temples and formal worship.16 The story of Kõkatsu and Prince Shõtoku, while developmentally on a level with the Buddhist account in strictly religious terms, reflects an even more advanced stage of religious and political integration. The statement that Kôkatsu's performances found a precedent in those of Uzume and Buddha's disciples shows that Zeami wishes to stress the co-presence of all three influences in the nõ of his time. But it was only with the institutionalization of nõ under Shôtoku's religious and politi- cal authority that he sees the three brought together to make up the comprehensive art form that he knew and practiced, with a definite place and function in the social and political world.17 With regard to the political side of Shôtoku's authority, it should be recalled that the prince was important for introducing Confucian principles of social organization and government into Japan as well as for encouraging Buddhism. The first article of his constitution of 604 begins with a quotation from Analects 1.12: "Harmony is to be valued" (Aston 1972: II, 129), and the constitution as a whole is replete with maxims and directives drawing on Confucian precepts. Thus, by placing the inaugu- ration of sarugaku performance under Shôtoku's auspices Zeami pre-</page><page sequence="11">40 Mathews figures Kaneyoshi's insistence on the moral benefits of sarugaku as a component of good governance, and also anticipates the patronage of no by the shogunate in his own time.18 Along with the detailed accounts of no's origins presented in chapter 4 of Transmitting the Flower, it is useful to look at the brief men- tion of them that Zeami makes in the prologue to this work. There Zeami questions whether the performances in India and Japan have exerted any practical influence on the nõ of his time: "Some will tell you [ sarugaku ] arose in the time of Buddha, and others will say it was passed down from the age of the gods; but that time has gone, and in either case, the age is so remote that it is beyond our power to imitate the effects they created" (Hare 2008: 25, my brackets). As Ley (2000: 197) observes, Zeami "seemingly dismisses an origin in India and a time scale that stretches back to the gods."19 But even if no's Indian and Japanese origins are not to be dismissed, still, "that time has gone," and Zeami acknowledges that whatever performance practices Uzume and Buddha's disciples may have employed are lost and unrecoverable. He traces the direct transmission of his art back to Kokatsu's performance. Since then, sarugaku "has persisted generation after generation," and the "descendents of that Kõkatsu have transmitted the art in their posi- tion as priests at the Kasuga and Hie shrines" (Hare 2008: 26) .20 It is the kind of "dramatic imitation" performed by Kõkatsu that Zeami regards as the direct forerunner of his art, with respect both to form, a variant of kagura singing and dancing, and purpose, stated here as to provide "for both the peace of the realm and the enjoyment of the people" (Hare 2008: 26). Thus sarugaku as a living art form is directly linked to China and Confucianism, even as the inspiration and influence of Shinto and Buddhism are duly noted.21 This Confucian association is underscored by the fact that Zeami goes on to issue an admonition that echoes an important Confucian precept: "Study the old, then, and make certain that you do not neglect tradition even while appreciat- ing the new" (Hare 2008: 26). In Analects 11.11, Confucius had put it thus: "A man is worthy of being a teacher who gets to know what is new by keeping fresh in his mind what he is already familiar with" (Lau 1979: 64) .22 The Confucian emphasis of Zeami's final account of no' s origins in both the prologue and chapter 4 of Transmitting the Flower makes it look as though he were reading a Confucian purpose for nõ back into the two previous accounts. Certainly, there was no actual historical connection between his art and the (mythic and legendary) perfor- mances of Uzume and the Buddha's disciples, as he seems fully aware. Most commentators reckon that one reason for their inclusion as prec- edents for nõ was Zeami's wish to dignify a performance genre that was</page><page sequence="12">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 41 often derided as an art of beggars. But as I have argued, Zeami also used these precedents to establish a socially valuable purpose for nõ. In doing so he exercised the freedom to manipulate them or cast light on them in whatever way he saw fit; or in the case of the Buddhist account, perhaps, to freely invent. Whereas the Amaterasu myth was enshrined in Japan's most important sacred texts, the episode of the disruption of the Buddha's sermon was apparently Zeami's creation. According to Marra (1993: 56), "No source [for it] has so far been found in any Bud- dhist scripture." Hare (2008: 47 n. 38) only says that Zeami's source is unclear, noting (after Omote and Katõ 1974: 38) that references to the building of the monastery are found in several texts that were available to Zeami. But if Zeami did invent the episode, he would indeed appear to have been reading a Confucian purpose back into the Buddhist precedent. And in that case, that a similar purpose could be found in the story of Amaterasu suggests that he also meant to stress the way the Shinto myth comported with a Confucian perspective. This is by no means to imply that Zeami ever thought of Shinto or Buddhism as essentially Confucian, the way Jihen, for example, argued that the bud- dhas were actually trace manifestations of the kamt Zeami undoubtedly had a commitment to both Shinto and Buddhism for their own sake, and an appreciation of what each contributed independently to nõ. It is just that the Confucian purpose he attributed to nõ provided him with the fundamental frame of reference within which to think about the nature of his artistic calling, and he placed his accounts of no's origins into that frame in such a way that the Confucian purpose, or a comple- mentary one, was highlighted in all of them. No* s Confucian Social Role: The Anecdote of Lady Takahashi In Talks on Sarugaku , Zeami relates an anecdote that alludes to no's Confucian social purpose in a different register from the refer- ences to this purpose in the accounts of no's origins in Transmitting the Flower. As the full title, Talks on Sarugaku by Zeshi [Zeami] after Sixty, indi- cates, this is a work of Zeami's old age, and it looks back on his thinking about nõ over the course of his entire career. The anecdote in question can thus serve as a kind of bookend to the references to no's purpose in Transmitting the Flower. The anecdote concerns the relations between the shogun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu and his mistress Lady Takahashi, and in particular the empathy maintained between them owing to her skill at recognizing his moods and responding to them. If one [has to] place this art in [the category of] etiquette or music, it belongs to music. It has to soften the relations between the human</page><page sequence="13">42 Mathews beings. Nevertheless, if one does not know the secrets of the human heart, one will come to a standstill [in one's career] . A sweetheart of Rokuon'in, Lady Takahashi (she was a prostitute of Higashi no toi), knew all the secrets of the human heart and pleased him especially, so she ended her days without falling into disfavour. She watched his mood, and when she had to press wine upon him, she pressed him, and when she had to refrain him [from drinking] , she refrained him, and thus she took very good care of him, and succeeded in life Zeshi [too] is praised by everybody for the fact that he is above all an expert in things like that, (de Poorter 1986: 129, brackets in original) This passage occurs in a section of Talks on Sarugaku that is mainly con- cerned with the proper comportment of the actor in public. The pre- ceding passages have to do with the wearing of swords by the actor's retainers, rude behavior in the presence of the nobility, and the like. While these examples echo Po Chů-ťs Confucian concern with his outward appearance, they might seem to have little to do with perfor- mance. But some of the examples pertain to behavior on performance occasions at least, such as making formal greetings to the nobility before the start of a performance. More significantly, the introduction to the anecdote about Lady Takahashi presents it as exemplifying the relations between actor and audience, suggesting a change of focus from public decorum to performance ethos. (The organization of Talks on Sarugaku as a series of notes and anecdotes rather than a continu- ous treatise lends itself to such shifts in perspective.) The statement "It [no] has to soften the relations between the human beings," which echoes the declaration of no's purpose in chapter 5 of Transmitting the Flower , refers explicitly to performance. Lady Takahashi' s own actions not only contain a strong performative element (serving sake to the shogun would always be a kind of performance, whether it occurred in a private or public setting), but also involve the same relationship between giver and receiver as obtains between actor and audience. In effect, the introduction to the anecdote states the purpose of nõ perfor- mance, and the anecdote itself illustrates an essential aptitude that the actor must have as a performer, as well as the nature of the relationship that must exist between actor and audience, for that purpose to be car- ried out effectively. That the purpose in question is Confucian is underscored by the two terms for categories of art that Zeami uses to characterize nõ in the introduction to the anecdote: "etiquette" and "music." While it might seem that Zeami is contrasting these two categories, and plac- ing nõ under the latter in a way that would trivialize it (as mere enter- tainment) , in fact both categories are important among the "arts" that</page><page sequence="14">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 43 make up Confucian social practice.23 In Japanese the terms in question are rei (ÍL, Chinese li) and gaku (5Ř, Chinese yüeh ).24 I have already had occasion to remark on the connection between li and harmony in Analects 1.12. The common translation of li as "rites" is suitable insofar as li in Confucian tradition refers to the entire "body of rules governing action in every aspect of life [which] were the repository of past insights into morality" (Lau 1979: 20). These rules of behavior were sanctioned and indeed ritualized by long and highly codified use. The forming of harmonious relations between people is the ultimate concern of Con- fucian social practice, and the key to securing such harmony is to act in accord with li, whether that means conducting the ancestral sacrifices properly or treating another person in an appropriate manner in any conceivable everyday encounter. While musical entertainment might seem to have little to do with such weighty social concerns, in fact li and yüeh are closely related in Confucian thought, as seen in the passage from the Book of Rites I quoted above. Music was seen as a crucial complement to the rites, such that the two words were regularly linked as a compound, li-yüeh (Japanese reigaku ).25 Confucius often speaks of the rites and music as being employed together, for example in Analects XI. 1: "The Master said, 'As far as the rites {li) and music {yüeh) are concerned, the dis- ciples who were the first to come to me were rustics while those who came to me afterwards were gentlemen. When it comes to putting the rites and music to use, I follow the former'" (Lau 1979: 106). The connections between the two concepts were so densely woven that an extensive body of theory was developed, beginning in China and later taken up in Japan, to explain their relationship. Kubota (1990) offers a useful explication of reigaku theory. According to Kubota, gaku is part of rei broadly defined (p. 51). But the precise relationship between the two can be seen in various ways. On one level, the aesthetic harmony and pleasing impact of successful musical performance can serve as a metaphor for the effective practice of the rites. But on a deeper level, gaku can constitute an activity of special importance alongside the prac- tice of rei; indeed, rei and gaku can be seen as the two wheels of a cart (pp. 52-53). Thus when Zeami says that nõ "belongs" to gaku , this is neither to dismiss rei entirely from the picture, nor yet to character- ize nõ as a mere frivolity in comparison with the serious practice of rei. Rather, it is to say that within the practice of rei, nõ has the special pur- pose of contributing what music has to offer to the promotion of social harmony. When he uses the words rei and gaku together (and in his Japanese there is no conjunctive "or" separating them), the tradition of thought about reigaku ensures that they will be understood as parts of a</page><page sequence="15">44 Mathews whole within which each plays its respective role. The influence of this tradition in Zeami's time can be seen in Thornhill's observation that in his commentary on Six Circles and OneDewdrop Kaneyoshi, unlike the Buddhist commentator Shigyoku, did not face a challenge in justifying the place of music in social life: "In the Confucian tradition, music is revered as one of the methods of cultivation; it generates feelings of empathy, and is fundamental in the development of jeď (Thornhill 1993: 176). Jen (t), often translated as "benevolence," is the Confu- cian term for the spirit and practice of living in harmony with others. In an important passage explaining his approach to cultivating social harmony, Confucius emphasizes the central role of li-yüeh : "Be stimulated by the Odes [Book of Songs ] , take your stand on the rites and be perfected by music" {Analects VIII. 8; Lau 1979: 93). 26 Gao (2001) contributes a helpful explication of the three items that Confucius calls into play here. Reading the Songs provides an initial opening up of emotive responsiveness and expression, acting in accord with knowl- edge of the rites establishes an outward framework of proper behav- ior, and music works directly on and through the emotions to fill in the framework of the rites with feelings of empathy, thus bridging the roles of rational understanding and emotional disposition in motivat- ing the kind of behavior that creates harmonious relations. Gao makes the important point that even though people are of different social status, they can come to have the same feelings through music (p. 51). This idea echoes Zeami's statement in Transmitting the Flower that "the performing arts . . . create excitement [feeling] in the high and low," discussed above. Zeami makes clear that Lady Takahashi's behavior has a soft- ening or mollifying effect on Yoshimitsu by showing it leading him, in his own way, to reciprocate. The phrase de Poorter translates, she "pleased him," gyoi yoku , could be more literally rendered "his mood toward her was good." The honorific form given to the word "mood," gyoi, indicates it is Yoshimitsu's mood toward Lady Takahashi that is meant, not hers toward him. The effect of her behavior is thus truly a smoothing of the relations between them on both sides, making those relations an exemplary case of reigaku in action.27 In this way they serve as a model both for the aptitude that the nõ actor must bring to perfor- mance and for the type of relationship that he must establish with his audience. The comment "[A/o] has to soften the relations between the human beings" states precisely the role that nõ as an art of music plays within reigaku . The phrase translated "has to soften," nikko to nasubeshi, contains in the word nikko an alternate reading of the character that Zeami used in the statement in Transmitting the Flower, quoted above, that "the performing arts generally exist to mollify [ yawa (?P )-rageru]</page><page sequence="16">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 45 people's hearts." Though nikko is rendered in the katakana syllabary in Zeami's text, the character clearly stands behind it. Thus what Zeami is saying is that within the context of reigaku, nõ, as a perform- ing art utilizing music, serves the purpose of rendering people's hearts softer and more pliable so that they can be more responsive to others and to what rei calls for on any occasion, thus creating harmony, the basic meaning of the character ÍP. Along with reigaku, the example of Lady Takahashi illustrates, albeit implicitly, another set of Confucian concepts: shu (^S) and chung (Í&amp;). In the form of the compound chung-shu, this pair was especially important in Neo-Confucianism.28 While shu is translated variously as "altruism, consideration, tolerance, reciprocity, deference," it can be taken to represent what I have been calling "empathy" in the relations between people. Chung is often translated "loyalty," but according to Lau (1979: 16), in the time of Confucius it meant "doing one's best." In either case, it refers to devotedness in meeting one's obligations. Similarly to yüeh in relation to li, chung serves as the means of carrying out shu. Shu and chung thus amount to having the ability to know what to do in relation to others and having the conviction to act on that ability. Hence they are key components in the functioning of the rites to promote social harmony. Shu appears together with the important term jen ("benevolence") in one of Confucius's major programmatic statements: "The ability to take as analogy what is near at hand [shu' can be called the method of benevolence" ( Analects VI. 30; Lau 1979: 85, my brackets). The phrase "to take as analogy what is near at hand" refers to using one's own wishes as a guide to understanding what oth- ers wish. By doing so one can act in accord with his wishes, and thus live in harmony with them. Confucius defines shu more explicitly along these lines in two other passages: "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire" ( Analects XII.2, XV.24; Lau 1979: 112, 135). Practicing shu depends not only on being able to enter into the mind of another person in specific instances, it also depends on insight into human wants in general that can only come from an honest effort to know oneself first. When Zeami remarks that Lady Takahashi "knew all the secrets of the human heart," he refers to this kind of insight. For the practice of shu to be given more than lip service clearly requires sincerity of effort. This is where chung c omes in. Lau (1979: 16) singles out the example of one of Confucius's students, Tseng Tzu, who is recorded as saying, "Every day I examine myself on three counts," the first of which is, "In what I have undertaken on another's behalf, have I failed to be chunģ. ?" {Analects, 1.4). In Analects XII.2, when Chung-kung asks Confucius about benevolence and is instructed, "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire," he replies, "Though I am</page><page sequence="17">46 Mathews not quick, I shall direct my efforts towards what you have said" (Lau 1979: 112); in other words, he will be chung ; he will do his best. Just as Lady Takahashi is an example of shu , she is also an example of chung, insofar as "she took very good care of' Yoshimitsu. The anecdote of Lady Takahashi thus conveys Zeami's under- standing that the role of the musical arts in general within reigaku is to foster empathy - that is, the capacity to practice shu - in the audience, thereby contributing to the softening of relations between people that is essential to the creation of social harmony. It also illuminates his conviction that in order to foster empathy in others, the artist, like the responsible person in society in general, must cultivate the capacity for empathy in himself. And for this chung is necessary. It is not surprising that, according to Motoyoshi's comment appended to the anecdote, Zeami himself was widely regarded as excelling at the same type of skill as Lady Takahashi. Apparently, his active devotion to the practice of empathy, both in the theatre and in public, did not go unnoticed. The Myth of Amaterasu and the Audience of Nõ Insofar as Lady Takahashi' s relations with Yoshimitsu are analo- gous to those between actor and audience, the anecdote about her forms a bridge between Zeami's references to no's social purpose in Transmitting the Flower and his explanations elsewhere of how this pur- pose is achieved in performance. In a later work, Pick Up a Jewel and Take the Flower in Hand ( Shügyoku tokka), Zeami returns to the myth of Amaterasu, this time to analyze the actor-audience dynamics implicit in the story in the light of new ideas about performance he had devel- oped since the writing of Transmitting the Flower . In the earlier work Zeami described Ama no Uzume's performance as capturing Ama- terasu's attention, so that the two figured as prototypes of actor and audience, respectively. In Pick Up a Jewel, Zeami reconfigures the actor- audience relations modeled by the divine participants in the perfor- mance, and in so doing finds richer symbolic potential in the mythic scenario.29 Posing a question about the origin of the term "interesting" to refer to moments in a performance that move the audience, Zeami replies: Now, this designation "interesting" derives from the happy occasion when the Great Goddess, captivated by the fine play in performance of kagura at Ama-no-kaguyama, deigned to push aside the boulder before her cave; she then could see the radiance of each and every one of the other gods' faces, and she was given to name this as white-in-the- face [i.e., "interesting"]. It cannot have been at that very instant that someone said, "Interesting." Rather, "interesting" was the name given</page><page sequence="18">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 47 to mark the experience as distinct. Before such a distinction had been made, what might one have possibly said? In this connection, if we examine the issue with regard to perfor- mance strategies in our vocation, then the spontaneous perception by which something is regarded as interesting by means of the fine play in performance is excitement without intent. . . . Now, once the Goddess had closed off the heavenly cave with a boulder, earth and sea reverted to a state of timeless obscurity and were utterly dark; when in absence of any intent, it then became light, in that instant of awareness, was there not simply the perception of joy? This would be felicity in vision. This would be the occasion of a spontaneous smile. When she deigned to close off the cave with a boulder and it was utterly dark and language was severed, that was "the wondrous"; when it had become light, that was "the flower"; and when a distinction was made through conscious awareness, that was "the interesting." (Hare 2008: 210-211, brackets in original)30 In this view of the performance situation, the audience is the assem- bled deities, who have been plunged into the darkness that has fallen upon the world. The goddess is the central performer who, beckoned to the stage by a secondary performer who serves as an intermediary between her and the audience, brings illumination and relief to them. This probably reflects Zeami's own evolving practice as playwright and performer, where he had turned the focus on a single main character in a marked shift from earlier sarugaku, which seems to have contained more dramatic interaction among a number of characters.31 Zeami's interest in one central character can be seen both in his theoretical writings and in his tendency to place such a figure at the center of his plays, many of which are not only extant but form the cornerstone of the nõ repertory today. Thus Amaterasu is a prototype of the shite , the principal actor in the modern nõ play, while Uzume is a prototype of the waki, the supporting actor. The way the goddess's effulgence liter- ally outshines Uzume's performance anticipates the shite' s assumption of a much more significant position than the waki , who, true to his designation as the "witness" or "bystander," serves characteristically to motivate the appearance of the shite before the audience.32 What is particularly important about Zeami's interpretation of the myth according to this scenario is the vision it contains of the subtle and indirect means by which a masterful actor can create a deep com- munication between himself and the audience. The actor brings the audience to recognize something as "interesting" or moving by "spon- taneous perception," and thus to feel "excitement" without any con- scious "intent" or reflection. Zeami characterizes this moment by the words "spontaneous smile," a phrase redolent in the first instance of</page><page sequence="19">48 Mathews Buddhist associations. To begin with, it alludes to the Zen phrase nenge mishõ, "a smile on grasping the flower."33 This phrase refers in turn to the famous "wordless transmission" from Buddha to Kâsyapa. Once when the Buddha was preaching a sermon, he held up a flower. No one grasped his meaning except Kâsyapa, who expressed his understanding by smiling. The Buddha thereupon announced that the True Dharma Eye had been transmitted. The original story contains a significance that is lost, though, in the simple phrase "a smile on grasping the flower," which calls attention to only one side of the transmission, the receiv- ing of the teaching by the disciple. By having the Buddha announce that his meaning has been conveyed, the original story embraces both sides, the teaching as well as its reception. Zeami's concern with both actor and audience suggests that in mentioning the smile he has the original story in mind and intends to evoke its paradigm of reciprocity between giver and receiver. Thus, Amaterasu appears as the equivalent of the Buddha transmitting understanding of Enlightenment, and the assembled deities as the equivalent of Kâsyapa receiving this under- standing. But while the unconscious spontaneity of this communica- tion is perhaps most evocatively conveyed by reference to a Buddhist concept such as nenge mishõ, the nature of the communication itself need not be confined to the field of Buddhism. It can also apply to the sensitivity to the inner life and feelings of another person that is key to Confucian empathy. Indeed, the entire point of the passage is that the communication between Amaterasu and the other deities is a prototype of that between actor and audience in Zeami's theatre. What seems more important to him is the nature of the communication itself, rather than its particular content, which of course, in the case of the theatre, would differ from one play to the next depending on the identity of the main character and the feelings evoked by that charac- ter's experience. We do well to remember that nõ is an entertainment, not a religious event, and while the audience's experience - as Zeami seemed very aware - has some affinity with the attaining of enlighten- ment, it is much more particularly an experience of identification with the inner life of a character. A dramatization of the story pattern of the Amaterasu myth as Zeami interprets it in Pick Up a Jewel occurs in one of his profoundest plays, Yamamba. The shite, Yamamba ("Mountain Crone"),34 takes on the role of a Bodhisattva (Japanese bosatsu) transmitting understand- ing of enlightenment to a female dancer, Hyakuma. It is significant that the recipient of this understanding is not the waki, as might be expected, but a shite tsure, an accompanying actor of the same perfor- mance school as the shite. Zeami may have configured the characters in this way to stress the closeness and reciprocity between Yamamba and</page><page sequence="20">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 49 the dancer. This closeness is emphasized by the fact that the dancer has become famous for her performances impersonating Yamamba, which have earned her the sobriquet "Hyakuma Yamamba." At the beginning of the play Hyakuma sets off on a pilgrimage to Zenkõji, a temple dedicated to Amida, the Buddha of Infinite Light.35 Along the way she encounters the real Yamamba, and learns of the crone's suf- fering as she makes her rounds of the mountains, of which Hyakuma had no idea. At the end of the play the newfound communion between the two is expressed in the following words spoken by Yamamba to the dancer: One tree's shade, one river's flow: both are links from other lives! And our bond is closer still when my name beneath the moon I hear the song that takes us round this world with all its sorrows. (Tyler 1992: 327) Like many plays in the nõ repertoire, and Zeami's above all, Yamamba is deeply imbued with Buddhist themes. Hyakuma's pilgrimage and her instruction in enlightenment by Yamamba are the largest such. On a smaller scale, there is the idea of reincarnation and its attendant sorrows in this passage, among others spread throughout the play. Even the communion between the dancer and Yamamba evokes the compassion for other suffering beings that Buddhism teaches. But the reciprocity between individuals dramatized by this communion need not be understood only in Buddhist terms. Indeed, what seems most dramatically moving at the end of the play is the deeply personal and humanistic empathy that has been created between Yamamba and Hya- kuma (the former may be a demon, but her human feelings and sym- pathies are at the heart of the play) . Hyakuma set off to Zenkõji to seek the path to enlightenment, but when she unexpectedly meets Yam- amba, she finds enlightenment right before her.36 Not only that, she finds oneness and mutual understanding with the Mountain Crone, who has heretofore been but a distant presence in her life despite her acclaimed portrayals of Yamamba on stage. While Zeami's focus in his mature dramaturgy is on the inner life of the main character (and indeed we are given a vivid account of the crone's sufferings in Yamamba ), it is striking how often this charac- ter's life is bound up in a relationship with another person, whether that relationship is determined by attraction or hatred: the two sisters with Yukihira in Matsukaze, Aritsune's daughter with Narihira in Izutsu, Atsumori with Renshõ in Atsumori. I believe this interest on Zeami's part in human relationships grows out of his Confucian concern with</page><page sequence="21">50 Mathews empathy and harmony, and I do not think it is coincidental that it has been neglected along with the Confucian elements in his art and thought more generally. And not only is such relationship a theme in his plays. To return to my main focus, the actor-audience relationship, the audience assumes the position of the person toward whom the main character's attention is directed, and hence the development of the relationship between the character and that person coincides with the audience's absorption in the character's inner life and feelings. Sometimes the relationship between character and audience is medi- ated by the waki (for example, Renshõ himself in Atsumori), sometimes through a different character (the dancer in Yamamba), sometimes through an object on stage (the pine tree in Matsukaze, the well in Izutsu). But in every case the audience's movement toward empathetic identification with the character is intensified by this mediation. The audience, like the assembly of gods in the story of Amaterasu, is not just a bystander. Indeed, Zeami's interpretation of the myth as the origin of the term "interesting" shows that he thinks of the audience's identifica- tion with the main character as a transcendent moment of emotional communion. The Actor's Discipline and the Transcendent Moment of Performance The chance of experiencing such moments of emotional tran- scendence is often thought of today as the reason nõ performers and audiences alike submit to extraordinary demands in training and per- forming, on the one hand, and watching and listening, on the other. Zeami's lifelong pursuit of the best means to create conditions condu- cive to such moments led him during his later career to intensify his focus, both in his dramaturgy and in his theoretical writings, on the interior world of the main character. This made for a significant shift away from the focus on the representation of character types ( mono- mane ) in the Yamato style of sarugaku that was his artistic heritage. In large part, Zeami accomplished this shift by foregrounding the more abstract and presentational aspects of performance - music, dance, and poetic text - while sharpening the physical and especially mental discipline of the actor necessary to make of these aspects an opening into the inner world of the shite. While, if my arguments above have merit, this shift was ultimately to serve the Confucian purpose of foster- ing empathy between the minds of actor and audience, it is no won- der that it was undertaken at every turn with the aid and direction of Buddhist ideas. Apart from the Neo-Confucian appropriation of ideas from Buddhist and Taoist metaphysics and psychology, the fundamen- tally humanist orientation of Confucianism provided little in the way of</page><page sequence="22">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 51 concepts to describe experiences transcending ordinary everyday per- ceptions. Buddhism, on the other hand, and especially Zen, was replete with means not only of describing such experiences but also of creating practical conditions favoring their occurrence. A famous performance precept introduced in Kakyõ ( A Mirror to the Flower) can serve as an example. Zeami directs the actor to "move ten parts of your mind and move seven parts of your body." The reason is that, "in all the movements of your body, when you restrain the body more than the mind, the body becomes the Substance and the mind the Instance; this will surely produce interest and excitement" (Hare 2008: 98). "Substance" {tai) and "Instance" ( yū ) are terms originating in Taoist thought in China, but they are best known in Japan by their use in Zen to denote essential and incidental aspects of phenomena and perceptions.37 Usually for Zeami, Substance is what is in the mind of the character (the essential) and Instance is what the actor shows outwardly through voice and movement (the incidental). Here, how- ever, he seems to say that restraint in the actor's movements creates a kind of cognitive paradox, reversing the way Substance and Instance are ordinarily perceived. By exercising such restraint, the actor makes the body the Substance and the mind the Instance. What this does is to make the body a manifestation of Substance in the visible realm, only to serve as a vehicle to the true, hidden Substance within. (Zeami implies that showing the full "ten" of the mind in bodily form is impos- sible.) If the actor manages the drawing in of the audience's viewpoint skillfully, the latter' s grasping of the true Substance in the mind of the character will come about in a flash of insight. It is just such insight that is symbolized by the illumination brought to the other deities by Amaterasu emerging from behind the cave boulder. While the terms Substance and Instance are associated with Buddhism and have little to do with Confucianism in themselves, Zeami's use of them to describe a way of drawing the audience deeply into the feelings of the shite supports the Confucian purpose of his art. Substance, in Zeami's theatrical use of the term, is what lies in the mind of the character, that is, the feelings that make up the charac- ter's inner world. As Zeami says in the ten/ seven passage, drawing the audience's attention into this world produces "interest ( omoshiroki ) and excitement ( kan )." As we have seen, omoshiroki is the recognition of a sudden moment of insight during a performance (symbolized in the myth of Amaterasu by the deities' conscious awareness of the goddess's emergence, which was at first a kind of wordless vision) and kan is the feeling aroused in the audience through identification with the charac- ter's inner world. As Nearman (1982: 351) puts it, "The tension created between the inner state of the actor and the outer restraint [projects]</page><page sequence="23">52 Mathews a 'spirit,'" and "this projected 'spirit' [appears] to the spectator as the feelings and emotions of the character portrayed."38 The ten/seven passage concerns the actor's physical skills - the visible aspects of performance - but in a later passage of Mirror to the Flower Zeami turns to the actor's mind, or inner performing spirit, as even more important than the skills that show on the outside: Also, even above the rank at which an actor is thought interesting is a level at which people say "Ah!" without themselves being conscious of it. This is excitement. Since it occurs without conscious awareness, this is a level of excitement at which you don't even realize that it's interest- ing. This could as well be called "unmixed." That's why, in the Classic of Changes , the word for excitement [£] is written without the graph for mind ['fr] at the bottom, thus jfjSc, pronounced "kan." That's because with true excitement, one has ventured beyond the conscious mind. (Hare 2008: 111, brackets in original) Zeami here describes a profound communication between actor and audience that goes beyond conscious awareness. The idea of ventur- ing beyond the conscious mind corresponds to the "excitement with- out intent" that Zeami found symbolized in the myth of Amaterasu. Again he resorts to a Buddhist concept to illustrate this idea. The term "unmixed," which was sometimes used to indicate a high level of excel- lence in waka poetry, is of Zen origin.39 But for once Zeami also has an apt Confucian reference at his disposal, namely, the interpretation of a passage in the Classic of Changes (I Chinģ ) where the character m, representing the word "excitement" (hsien) , is replaced by JbSc. Since the change involves omitting the element meaning "mind" (&gt;LN) from FÈ, the resulting simplified character is interpreted as conveying the idea of "excitement without conscious awareness." According to Omote and Rato (1974: 95), this interpretation originated in the Neo-Confucian thought of Chu Hsi.40 It might seem that such abstract and esoteric references, Confu- cian and Buddhist alike, refer to little more than a kind of aesthetic fris- son. However, Zeami's shift from representing character to presenting a pageant of poetry, music, and dance was not undertaken primarily to impress audiences with the actor's skill, but to engage their interest in a character whose inner world lies at the center of the performance. As Quinn (2005: 43) explains, "Zeami's reworking of the concept [mono- mane] is an integral part of a larger shift away from a representational style that tells a story through lifelike reproduction of human behav- ior to dramatic enactment in which the emotional life of a character or his story is made the subject for mimesis." In the kind of play that Zeami came to prefer and that remains today what is often thought of</page><page sequence="24">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 53 as definitive of nõ itself, the shite is typically the ghost of a person who suffers from lingering attachment to the world of the living and who finds in the prayers of the waki (often a priest) the prospect of release. Through the intermediacy of the waki the audience is drawn out of their own consciousness into the inner life of another being who is at once remote from them, a spirit from the other world, and close to them, a person suffering the same kind of attachment as binds every- one to the wheel of suffering. The moment when the mind of actor and audience meet is thus also the moment when the audience suddenly and powerfully identifies with this character.41 The Amaterasu myth can be seen as a prototype of this kind of play also. The goddess, like the shite, is the one who is distressed and in need of release. Uzume's singing and dancing function like the waki s prayers, acting to bring about the goddess's liberation. The audience of other deities looks on with concern. And when the god- dess is freed, bringing warmth and illumination, their faces light up along with hers. Zeami's warrior play Atsumori provides an excellent example of this plotline in dramatic form. This play is particularly well known in the West, in part because it contains more of the character interaction typical of Western dramaturgy. The shite is the young Taira nobleman Atsumori, who was killed by the rough Minamoto warrior Kumagai and whose ghost haunts the shore of Suma Bay where he met his death. Kumagai himself is the waki , who has renounced war- fare and taken vows as the Buddhist priest Renshõ in order to pray for Atsumori. Renshõ returns to Suma, where Atsumori's ghost appears in response to his prayers. Stirred to recall the past, Atsumori relives the night before and day of the fatal encounter. Seeing his enemy, he pre- pares to attack, sword drawn. But suddenly he sees not an enemy, but a friend praying for him. He drops his sword with the thought that the two may be reborn on the same lotus leaf. Just as the other deities are distressed because of their concern for Amaterasu and are filled with light and warmth upon the emergence of the goddess, the audience of Atsumori identifies empathetically with the young warrior's spirit from his initial feelings of vengefulness to his final illumination and release. Of course, this release is explicitly thematized as enlightenment. But as in Yamamba, the empathy shown by Renshõ to Atsumori and the latter's reciprocation of it represent a human interest that goes beyond any particular religious interpretation. More to the point, the audience's identification with Atsumori's inner world as he moves ever deeper into the feelings about his death that are at the core of his existence, finally reaching the point of attempting violent revenge, is a psycho- logical reality in its own right, as engaging for its human interest as for any religious precepts it enacts.42</page><page sequence="25">54 Mathews One might object that this kind of identification between audi- ence and character is a function of every form of theatre. And I would acknowledge that some kind of audience-character identification is probably of the essence of theatre. Even more, I would acknowledge that some such identification is probably involved in any encounter with a mimesis of human life, theatrical or otherwise. But the theatrical traditions of the world have a great variety of specific purposes, and not all are so centrally concerned with the absorption of the audience in the inner life of the main character as nõ is. To take one other classical form that is often compared to no, Greek tragedy can be seen as having almost the opposite goal, namely, of distancing the audience from the characters - or, to follow Aristotle's sense of where tragedy directs its focus, from the action ( Poetics 1450al6-38; Heath 1996: 11-12) - so that the audience takes a critically reflective stance toward what is happen- ing on stage. This is not to deny that Aristotle has much to say about the emotions. Indeed, pity is one of the emotions he specifies as being evoked by tragedy, and it certainly involves some degree of identifica- tion with the character being pitied. But Aristotelian pity is not the same thing as empathy. Aroused by the sight of undeserved suffering ( Poetics 1453a4; Heath 1996: 21), it implies an observer who is not only exercising judgment, but also occupies a superior position in relation to the sufferer. It is fear that brings us closer to "someone who is like ourselves" ( Poetics 1453a4-5; Heath 1996: 21), but only in the sense that we fear that person's fate might be our own. Further, apart from any consideration of the emotions, Aristotle's apology for tragedy depends on the argument that tragedy, like philosophy, teaches something uni- versal about human life as opposed to the particulars recounted by history ( Poetics 1451a36-1451bll; Heath 1996: 16); hence his emphasis on plot and the logical progression of dramatic events. Such a didac- tic purpose requires a distanced and reflective view of those events and a concomitant critical attitude toward the characters who are their agents. To the extent that pity and fear arise in the minds of the tragic audience, they do so much more from these circumstances of the action, rather than from any identification with the subjectivity of the characters ( Poetics 1453M-14; Heath 1996: 22). Scholars today may find Aristotle's views of tragedy more or less instructive about the actu- alities of the fifth-century theatre. But recent work on tragedy offers little to support the idea that anything like Confucian empathy is at the heart of the tragic audience's experience. Indeed, the dominant trend is toward analysis of the political and social functions of tragedy before a critically engaged citizen audience - an approach that has much in common with Aristotle's interest in the didactic role of the genre.43 To foster the audience's empathetic identification with the</page><page sequence="26">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 55 main character - the goal of Zeami's theatre - requires that the actor enter completely into the subjectivity of the character he is perform- ing, indeed to "become" that character. This task requires the utmost discipline over a lifetime of training. Zeami's most intensely personal evocation of this obligation appears in his late work An Effective Vision of Learning the Vocation of Fine Play in Performance ( Yügaku shüdöfüken) . Unlike most of Zeami's treatises, which range over a variety of topics, An Effective Vision focuses consistently on one theme, training, and so it is concerned from start to finish with the artist's self-cultivation over the life cycle. It is also, not coincidentally, one of his texts that alludes most frequently, and with greatest consequence, to Confucian sources. The first section is introduced by a quotation from the Mao preface to the Book of Songs about early success succumbing to failure, and consid- ers what makes for interesting performances in maturity as compared with childhood.44 The next section begins with a quotation of Analects IX.22, "There are those that sprout but do not flower, and there are those that flower but do not set fruit," followed by Zeami's admonition, 'You should know this verse to be the jo-ha-kyū for your training in the forms of the art throughout your life" (Hare 2008: 183). Jo-ha-kyū is the well-known principle of rhythm and structure in nõ , consisting of a slow beginning, then a breaking out into a quicker pace, and finally acceleration to an abrupt conclusion. Zeami builds on the quotation from the Analects by equating jo , ha, and kyü with sprout, flower, and fruit, evoking spring, summer, and fall in the botanical cycle and child- hood, youth, and maturity in the human.45 The imagery of the chang- ing seasons is inspired by Neo-Confucianism, and Zeami's introduction of it here anticipates a decisive use he will make of it in the concluding section of this work. The next section takes a turn toward the abstruse with an intro- ductory quotation from the Heart Sutra: "Form is emptiness, emptiness is form" (Hare 2008: 184). But it quickly becomes apparent that Zeami is using the second half of this expression, "emptiness is form," to refer to the perfect freedom of the master actor who has, after a lifetime of training, attained to the "miraculous flower" and can thus perform with not "the slightest bit of artificiality and no grasping in the mind after a particular manner of expression" (Hare 2008: 186). The idea of complete freedom in an artistic or spiritual pursuit resulting from long and disciplined practice is most often associated with Buddhism and Taoism, but it is common to all the major East Asian traditions. As Thornhill (1993: 5-6) points out, the idea of a disciplined path ( michi ) to be followed in mastering an art, which was central to Muromachi aesthetics and artistic practice, drew on Buddhist, Taoist, and Confu- cian sources alike. Self-cultivation was in fact a central concern of Neo-</page><page sequence="27">56 Mathews Confucianism.46 Thus Hare (1986: 233-34) detects a Confucian source for Zeami's conception of the actor's course of training, adducing a famous description by the Master of his own lifelong journey on the path of benevolence: Zeami's formulation of nine stages of artistic development, positing a complete liberation of individual capabilities through the gradual cultivation of one's talents, seems to point to the first article of the Analects:. "The Master said, At fifteen I set my heart upon learning. At thirty, I had planted my feet firm upon the ground. At forty, I no longer suffered from perplexities. At fifty, I knew what were the bid- dings of Heaven. At sixty, I heard them with a docile ear. At seventy, I could follow the dictates of my own heart; for what I desired no longer overstepped the boundaries of right."47 In Pick Up a Jewel Zeami himself quotes another statement of Confu- cius on the matter of overstepping boundaries: "exceeding is falling short" (Hare 2008: 221). 48 This quotation concerns the exactness in dramatic imitation necessary to attain to "mastery of subjective effect" and thus to be able to enter fully into the subjectivity of a character. Zeami advises: "Only when you have truly entered into a mastery of the technical effects at the outermost edge of performance can it be called the rank at which the most fundamental effects commensurate with the capacity of your intent are in your control" (Hare 2008: 221). According to a well-known paradox of East Asian artistic and spiritual disciplines, with perfect freedom comes perfect control. For Zeami it is the actor's exacting self-control acquired from a lifetime of dis- ciplined training that enables him to bring out the full depth of a character's subjectivity with complete naturalness and freedom from distraction.49 The final section of An Effective Vision concerns the transcendent moment of communication without conscious intent between actor and audience. It begins with a striking Confucian citation, and ends, after seeming to have turned in a decidedly Buddhist direction, with an even more striking Confucian allusion.50 The opening citation is of a famous chapter of the Analects (V.4), where Tzu-kung asks Confu- cius what he thinks of him, and the Master replies, "'You are a vessel.' 'What kind of vessel?' 'A sacrificial vessel'" (Lau 1979: 76). It is not clear what Confucius meant by this vessel.51 But Zeami follows the com- mentary of K'ung An-kuo (second century bce) in interpreting it as a metaphor for skill or capacity. He also cites the commentary of Pao Hsien (first century ce), who identifies it as a sacred object made of jade, suitable for ancestral offerings of grain.52 K'ung An-kuo seems to have in mind the traditional Confucian "gentleman" ( chün tzu), whose</page><page sequence="28">Zeami 's Confucian Theatre 57 duty, itself demanding extensive training and personal cultivation, was to maintain the people's welfare through service in whatever branch of government he might come to be employed. Pao Hsien takes a more expansive view of the metaphor, and Zeami seems particularly taken by the idea that the sacred object he describes helps sustain the spiritual essence of the community by serving as an intermediary between the living and their ancestors. Zeami combines both views of the metaphor in applying it to the actor's ability to excel in a variety of roles while always realizing the goal of creating an emotionally and indeed spiri- tually transcendent experience for the audience: "In terms of our art, this vessel must be the diversely accomplished master who has attained each and every [visual and aural] attraction of performance" that is instrumental to the "creation of excitement" in the audience (Hare 2008: 186). The nature of the actor's contribution to the welfare of the people is of course quite distinct from that of the gentleman. But Zeami sees it as also a vital one, and hence worthy of having the Confu- cian metaphor of the vessel applied to it. Zeami proceeds to recontextualize the vessel image as a meta- phor for the Buddhist concept of nothingness in the pair being ( u) and nothingness (mu). Just as "what manifests being is nothingness," so do the actor's stage effects come forth from the expressive power residing in his mind ( kokoro ). The mind may be seen as "empty," in the sense of being the potential source of the actor's stage effects, undistracted by any conscious intention for the performance to come. But out of this emptiness the actor can create all of "the phenomenal manifesta- tions of his art" (Hare 2008: 187). As the notion of "coming forth" sug- gests, the concepts of being and nothingness can easily be aligned with the idea of creation, and even as these concepts continue to inform the language of this passage, the Neo-Confucian imagery of creation is blended in with them. In the last paragraph this imagery, including birth, growth, and seasonal change, comes to the fore: The vessel that gives birth to all things, from the seasonal changes of flower and leaf to the snow and the moon, the mountains and seas, the plants and trees, the sentient and even the nonsentient, is the universe. In taking these many things as the affective supplements to performance, our aim is to make the mind a vessel of the universe, establish that vessel of mind securely in the vast and formless empty Way, and attain the miraculous flower of attainment through fine play in performance. (Hare 2008: 187-188) The imagery of birth and growth through the seasons in a cosmologi- cal and ultimately metaphysical perspective resembles the precepts of Kaneyoshi's commentary on Six Circles and One Dewdrop (Thornhill</page><page sequence="29">58 Mathews 1993: 34-42). Kaneyoshi draws on the first hexagram of the I Ching ' Ch'ien (The Creative), to develop a paradigm of the parallel stages of botanical and human life cycles that corresponds to Zenchiku's first circle, the Circle of Longevity: "The wheel of Heaven revolves day and night without stopping for the interval of a single breath; the four sea- sons run their course, and various things are born. Is this not [due to] the power of the Creative?" (p. 38). Kaneyoshi interprets the sixth cir- cle, the Circle of Emptiness, as the Great Ultimate, and the One Dew- drop as the Ultimate of Nonbeing. This is the culminating, metaphysi- cal stage in Kaneyoshi' s Neo-Confucian cosmology, where all dualism is transcended: "the Ultimate of Nonbeing departs from the word-based distinction of being and emptiness; it does not lie within the realm of thought" (p. 41). 53 Kaneyoshi's progression from the Creative through the cycles of growth to the Ultimate of Nonbeing is a counterpart to Zeami's notion of the birth and growth of all natural phenomena in the "vast and formless empty Way" (Hare 2008: 188). This conception of the universe has a strong Taoist flavoring. But such absorption of Taoist views in a Neo-Confucian perspective does not represent any abandonment of the commitment to social responsibility that was fun- damental to the original teachings of Confucius. Zeami's reference to the mind of the actor is key. It recalls the mind as Substance, the inner life of a character into which the actor must draw the audience so it can identify empathetically with the character's feelings. Zeami hardly proposes to turn himself into a Taoist sage and fly off beyond the con- straints of time and space. Applied to theatrical performance, his idea of the "vast and formless empty Way" must be taken metaphorically. As such, it refers to the depths of the human spirit as an inexhaustible source of subjective effects for the actor to create and for the audience to identify with. The "vessel of the universe" is, finally, but another way for Zeami to describe the actor's role in relation to the audience that he alludes to rather more concretely (and in the generally more down-to-earth manner of the Analects) in the anecdote about Lady Takahashi. That the "vessel" is to serve the audience, and not just be a vehicle for the actor's self-realization, Zeami has made clear a few lines before: "What creates the seeds and flowers of every attraction in this fine play in per- formance is the intent that pervades the performer's power to excite" (Hare 2008: 187). As Quinn (2005: 284) observes, Zeami's application of the metaphor of the seasons in an Effective Vision echoes similar uses of this metaphor in Transmitting the Rower, and is "a reminder that what mattered most in his enterprise had not changed very much."54 Indeed, it had not changed fundamentally at all. What mattered most was the Confucian purpose of his art, which he refined with many elements of</page><page sequence="30">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 59 Buddhism and Taoism, but never lost sight of as the goal those refine- ments were to serve. NOTES I am grateful to Kathy Foley and ATJ's anonymous readers for their construc- tive criticisms. 1. Late Antique and medieval art, especially Byzantine, can be seen under this light; also, key strains of modernism. Not coincidentally, Japanese art and poetry have had a major influence on Western modernism, as witness impressionism and imagism (on the latter see Miner 1957). 2. Creel (1960: 254-278) documents a widespread and influential interest in Confucianism during the Enlightenment. At a time when the tra- ditional demands of society were still seen as imposing crucial limits on a ris- ing, proto-Romantic individualism, Confucian teaching about the balance between individual aspiration and social duty could be seen as having much to offer. As Creel notes, this broad practical interest in Confucianism has never since been revived in the West. 3. My argument builds on the insights of Hoff (1992: 131-132), who notes that Buddhism, especially Zen, was useful to Zeami because it enabled him "to conceptualize the otherwise practical matters of theatre," in particular "the joint experience of actor and audience," and Nishio (1965: 291-292), who suggests, even further, that the Buddhist elements in Zeami's writings are only a means to the end of explicating his artistic principles. As I will argue, those principles are grounded in a Confucian commitment to fostering emo- tional identification between actor and audience. See also Quinn (2005: 236- 237, 368 n. 132), who agrees with Hoff and Nishio, but does not take up the question of what ideological basis might underlie Zeami's artistic principles and practice independently of any intellectual framework for understanding and describing their efficacy. 4. On the medieval syncretism of Shinto, Buddhist, and Chinese thought, see Thornhill (1993: 34-35 with nn. 50-52, 178-186). 5. On this point see Haga (1981: 44-51). The major figures in the development of Neo-Confucianism were Chou Tun-i (1017-1073) and the brothers Ch'eng Hao (1032-1085) and Ch'engI (1033-1107). Their work was synthesized and extended by Chu Hsi (1130-1200), and it was through the lat- ter's writings that Neo-Confucianism was known to medieval Japan. 6. On this point see Ching (1986: 273-274). 7. On Kaneyoshi's commentary see Thornhill (1993: 34-42 [for trans- lation], 122-149 [for analysis], with further notes at 176, 181-186 passim). At the beginning of his commentary Kaneyoshi signals his ecumenical approach: "There are three teachings in the world, and like the three legs of a cauldron, one cannot be left out" (p. 34). 8. Thornhill (1993: 35 n. 54) points out that Kaneyoshi's quotation is inaccurate, though the meaning remains unchanged.</page><page sequence="31">60 Mathews 9. Unless otherwise noted, translations of the Analects are taken from Lau (1979). 10. Omote (1969: 176) argues that although the ideas in Transmit- ting the Flower axe largely Zeami's own, he attributes them to his father out of respect. Omote compares a similar attribution in Fujiwara Teika's Maigetsushõ (Monthly Notes), composed in 1219 and one of the most important docu- ments of classical Japanese poetics. Omote notes that such respect by a suc- cessor for a predecessor in an art tradition was conventional. I would add that it reflects a particularly Confucian attitude and indicates the degree to which Zeami was thinking of his artistic activity in a broadly Confucian perspective during his early career. 11. Unless otherwise noted, all translations of Zeami's texts, except Talks on Sarugaku , are from Hare (2008). Translations of Talks on Sarugaku are from de Poorter (1986). 12. Specifically, they lay in the Chinese san-yüeh (ffc^c, Japanese san- gaku , later sarugaku) , a performance miscellany including comic mime, song, dance, acrobatic acts, and conjuring tricks, which was imported into Japan from China and Korea in the eighth century (Konishi 1991: 520). Though Zeami's art form was known as sarugaku in his own time, I use its modern name, nõ, in this article, unless the context refers specifically to the name sarugaku . 13. According to Omote and Katõ (1974: 39), Zeami used the story of Shötoku's introducing of the name sarugaku with the character í asa back- drop to his own theory that this was the correct way of writing saru. As Omote points out, the art was originally called sangaku , the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese san-yüeh (cf. n. 12 above), and written using the characters in the original Chinese, In Zeami's time it went by the name sarugaku with saru rendered as 3Ř, "monkey." The idea of "giving voice to enjoyment" is a preeminently Confucian way of looking at the arts (see my discussion of li- yüeh , "the rites and music," later in this article), suggesting that Zeami meant to stress sarugaku* s Confucian associations in the story of Shötoku's naming of it. 14. For Confucian endorsements of the Songs , which often include examples of their practical use, see Analects 1.15-16; II.2; III.2, 8, 20; VIII.3, 8; IX.27, 31; XI. 6; XIII.5; XIV.39; XVI.13; XVII.9-10 (Lau 1979: 61-63, 67-68, 70, 92-93, 100, 106, 119, 130, 141, 145). Interestingly, this passage in Talks on Sarugaku does not mention a Buddhist source for sarugaku at all. 15. Scholars have traced some elements of nõ performance, especially the dances of the shite that mark the dramatic highpoints of a play, to rituals of shamanic possession that lie behind the myth of Amaterasu and that are still performed in some places in Japan today (see, e.g., Ortolani 1984). 16. The detail of the "heathens . . . dancing with festooned branches and sheaves of bamboo grass," which resembles the description of Uzume, suggests resistance to Buddhism by more primitive, indeed shamanic prede- cessors. Though not historically accurate as regards other Indian religions at the time Buddhism was introduced, the detail accords with Zeami's sense of the developments between the age of the gods and the time of Buddha.</page><page sequence="32">Zeami' s Confucian Theatre 61 17. Linear paradigms such as the sequence of origin stories Zeami pro- vides for nõ can be read in either direction. Thornhill (1993: 180) suggests that Zeami' s genealogical ordering of the Amaterasu and Buddha stories gives primary importance to the former, with "the historical precedence of antiq- uity" standing in for "the ontological priority of essence" over "trace" (refer- ring to the Buddhist idea of the Buddha's essence in relation to trace manifes- tations) . Thornhill cites this as one example among others of medieval Shinto establishing its superiority over Buddhism. However, by leaving out the story of Shõtoku and Kõkatsu that follows the Shinto and Buddhist accounts, he neglects another prioritizing impulse in this passage that renders it less clear as an example of Shinto apologetics. Once the Chinese source of nõ is added, the focus shifts from the priority of historical precedent to the culmination of a process in which the last stage constitutes the highest level of ontological development (represented by the new name Shõtoku gives this last stage). This resembles Aristode's teleological approach in the Poetics , where tragedy is seen as the endpoint of the development of serious dramatic poetry from its beginnings in improvisation (1449a; Heath 1996: 8). 18. No was also, of course, patronized by Buddhist temples. But I don't mean to dismiss the fact that it was put to official use by religious organizations as well as the government. I only wish to show that Zeami framed the purpose of nõ performance in primarily Confucian terms. 19. It is noteworthy that even in chapter 4 Zeami adds the caveat "so they say" to the claim that sarugaku had its beginning in Uzume's performance. 20. Following the story of Kokatsu's performance in chapter 4, Zeami elaborates on the transmission of sarugaku by Kokatsu's descendents, describ- ing the occasion of another performance of Kokatsu's sixty-six pieces by Hada no Ujiyasu, this time at imperial command. Once more, Zeami refers to the three sources of nõ in Japan, India, and China. But the focus remains on the tradition deriving from the last of these, preserved by Kokatsu's descendants under the authority granted by Prince Shõtoku and confirmed by Emperor Murakami. 21. Ley (2000: 197) summarizes the conjunction of the three as fol- lows: "A religious sanction for the ancestral nõ, performed for the public good, is allied to imperial patronage." 22. Regarding what is new and fresh, Zeami quotes from Analects 11.11 in a passage in A Mirror to the Flower ( Kakyõ ) concerned with keeping a sense of freshness and novelty before the audience: "As Confucius said, 'Warm to the old and know the new. Therewith shalt thou be a teacher'" (Hare 2008: 110). 23. Rimer and Yamazaki (1984: 247) note that these terms (which they render "virtue" and "pleasure") represent Confucian concepts. 24. The character |L is the simplified form used in Zeami 's writings; the full form is found in Analects 1.12 quoted earlier in this article. 25. Tsuda (1965: 201) emphasizes the centrality of li-yüeh in Confu- cianism by noting that Taoists often attacked Confucians by denouncing this particular compound of ideas. 26. Note also Analects III. 3: "The Master said, 'What can a man do with the rites who is not benevolent? What can a man do with music who is not</page><page sequence="33">62 Mathews benevolent?'" (Lau 1979: 67). As Lau (1979: 14) explains, benevolence is "the most important moral quality a man can possess," insofar as it is the quality enabling him to put into effective practice such things as the rites and music. 27. While the hierarchical nature of Lady Takahashi and Yoshimitsu's relationship is inescapable, it is not all just giving on her part and receiving on his. The mutual empathy within this relationship reflects one of the cor- nerstones of Confucian social philosophy, namely, that the relations between people should not be based solely on the relative power of those above and below, but should be tempered by mutual respect and concern. See, e.g., Ana- lects III.18-19 (Lau 1979: 70). 28. On the importance of chung-shu in Neo-Confucianism, see Liu (1986: 443-444). Regarding the following discussion of shu and chung, see further Lau (1979: 15-16). 29. On Zeami's reconfiguring of the actor-audience relations in the Amaterasu myth between the writing of Transmitting the Flower and Pick Up a Jewel , see also the analysis of Thornhill (1993: 67-72). 30. Omoshiroki , as Zeami points out, means literally "white-in-the-face." But it is easy to see that this word can convey any number of ideas having to do with whatever brightens the face: what is interesting, attractive, impressive, and so on. Rimer and Yamazaki (1984: 260) note that Zeami gives omoshiroki a wide range of meanings in different contexts. In this interpretation of the Amaterasu myth he seems to envision the other gods experiencing amaze- ment and deep feeling at the goddess's appearance. 31. On this point see Hare (1986: 289 n. 23) and O'Neill (1958: 124). 32. On this aspect of Zeami' s dramaturgy and its influence see Hare (1986: 237). 33. Regarding this phrase see Hare (2008: 211 n. 22); Omote and Kato (1974: 188). 34. The translation of Yamamba as "Mountain Crone" is from Tyler (1992: 309-328). 35. Worship of Amida was known as the Pure Land sect. Devotees believed that by invoking this Buddha's name they would be reborn in Ami- da's Western Paradise. The Buddhism of Zeami's plays, as opposed to that of his theoretical works, is most often Pure Land, interwoven with other strands of Buddhist belief and practice whose origins reached back into antiquity. 36. The idea that enlightenment is always immediately present is itself an idea common in many sects of Mahayana Buddhism, including the Pure Land sect. 37. On "Substance" and "Instance" see further Hare (2008: 13-14, 491) and Rimer and Yamazaki (1984: 260, 263), who translate the latter as "Function." 38. See also Hare (1986: 236-243) for an excellent discussion of Zeami's interest in the inner life and emotions of his characters. 39. See Rimer and Yamazaki (1984: 91), where the term is translated as "purity unmixed." 40. Zeami stresses the communicative dimension of the relation between actor and audience in another passage in Mirror to the Rower. "The</page><page sequence="34">Zeami's Confucian Theatre 63 actor who understands how to arouse the interest of his audience should have an advantage in performance. A member of the audience, moreover, who watches the performance with discernment vis-à-vis the actor's mind is one who knows performance" (Hare 2008: 119). 41. See Brown (2001: 25-30) for an excellent description of the inter- twining of subjectivity between actor and audience in nõ. 42. Such drawing of the audience into the inner world of the charac- ter can be experienced in nõ performance today. It is a common occurrence for audience members to be profoundly moved by an effective performance of a play with strong human interest at its center. For their part, nõ actors are conscious of the potential for moving the audience in this way and careful to create performance conditions conducive to it. In the words of one actor, "I try to make the stage expand the power of imagination of each person of the audience. Through the shite, each member of the audience will create their own perspective. I think Zeami regarded as very important the part that one doesn't see, the part of kokoro [mind, heart], the kokoro that tries to communi- cate" (Oshima 2010). 43. For two of the more important contributions, see Vernant and Vidal-Naquet (1988: 23-48) and Griffith (1995); for an overview of recent views, see Carter (2007). 44. The Mao preface quotes the line "Wee, ho, prettie, ho, hooty-bird's brood," and comments: "'Wee' and 'prettie' refer to a fine and dainty appear- ance. 'Hooty-bird' is the name of a bird [the owl]" (Hare 2008: 181, my brack- ets). Zeami appends a quotation from the commentary on the Book of Songs by Cheng Hsüan (second century ce) interpreting the line as referring to success and failure: "The lords of Wei at first achieved some good, but failed to suc- ceed in the end. They were like the hooty-bird" (Hare 2008: 181). Omote and Katõ (1974: 162) point out that the Mao commentary had already interpreted the line about the hooty-bird as stressing the importance of early training as the basis for success in later years. 45. The idea that a human lifetime, like all of nature, follows the pro- gression of jo-ha-kyū is in accord with Zeami's belief that this principle applies to everything that exists. See his remarks about the universality of jo-ha-kyü in Transmitting the Flower and Pick Up a Jewel (Hare 2008: 39, 215). Ueda (1991: 69-70) comments that for Zeami, "The rhythm of the Nõ play is suggestive of the great hidden law of the universe; it is, in fact, the universal rhythm of life." 46. Perhaps, as with so much else, this was under the influence of Bud- dhism and Taoism. But, as noted above, Neo-Confucianism always maintained a distinction in its linking of self-cultivation to social responsibility. On the role of self-cultivation in Neo-Confucianism see, e.g., Ching (1986); Tu (1979: 17-68). 47. The passage quoted is Analects II.4. 48. The original is from Analects XI. 16: "There is little to choose between overshooting the mark and falling short" (Lau 1979: 108). 49. The Confucian associations in Zeami's concept of self-cultivation are seen further in his citation of Analects XV.8 in A Course to Attain the Flower</page><page sequence="35">64 Mathews ( Shikadõ ) : "When someone is to be spoken to, and you fail to speak to him, you waste a person. When someone is not to be spoken to, and you speak to him, you waste your words" (Hare 2008: 137). Zeami refers here to the transmission of nõ from master to pupil. 50. Hare (1986: 232-233) makes much of this section, quoting it in full; indeed, it motivates his remarks on the importance of Confucian ideas to Zeami that I mentioned at the beginning of this article. 51. See Lau (1979: 204-206) for suggestions. 52. See Quinn (2005: 377 n. 104) for further details of Zeami's inter- pretation deriving from the two commentaries. 53. Kaneyoshi draws on Taoist and Buddhist ideas as well as Confu- cian in his commentary, demonstrating how readily an author writing from an avowedly Confucian perspective could incorporate elements of the other thought systems. On the syncretism involved see further, Thornhill (1993: 34-42, 122-149). 54. Quinn (2005: 284) cites the following sentence from chapter 7 of Transmitting the Flower in particular: "The actor who has pursued all the options to the fullest is like one who bears seeds that will flower the year through - from the plum blossoms of early spring to the chrysanthemums blooming to their close in autumn."
