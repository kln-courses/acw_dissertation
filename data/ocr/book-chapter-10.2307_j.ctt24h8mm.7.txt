<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin 5 THE ROCk ART OF THE SYDNEY BASIN There are two art contexts in the Sydney Basin: in rockshelters and on open engraving sites. Shelter  sites contain mostly pigment art (pictographs) but occasionally also engravings (petroglyphs).  Medium  is  generally  defined  as  ‘the  physical materials  of which  the  artefact  consists;  or  the  techniques employed to produce the artefact’ (Clegg 1977:260). Medium here is defined as art  context - for pragmatic and theoretical reasons. A shelter art site is defined as all the art which  occurs within the dripline boundaries of a single sandstone rockshelter. An engraving site is  defined as all  the art which is  located across  the  limits of an open sandstone boulder/platform  which is usually surrounded by a soil matrix and/or vegetation.    The location or context, in which the art is produced i.e. in the open or in a shelter, may  indicate something about the social context of the art (and the site). For the purposes of this study  the social context of the art – and whether it was located within a rockshelter or in the open -  formed the basis for the initial separation of the two media.    ‘Art’ is defined loosely as all humanly made marks which occur in repeatable identifiable  forms. In Sydney, art results from either the application of material (coloured, black or white  pigments) for pigment art or from the removal of the sandstone matrix by a variety of techniques  (for petroglyphs or engravings10). Both art assemblages were classified using motifs, the majority  of which have recognisable forms - human, animal or inanimate objects, or can be categorised  as geometric shapes. A large proportion the art consists of unrecognisable or incomplete motifs  - particularly in the shelter art assemblage. These motifs were included in the initial analysis of  both art assemblages, since they provide a more accurate census of the two assemblages and their  general technique information. The motif classification used was based on a taxonomy of visually  recognisable figurative forms. These have been given the names of the forms which they most  closely resemble but these terms are analytical labels (see Clegg 1977, 1981). This classification  is a heuristic devise to facilitate the analysis of the data. Given that Sydney Basin rock art is  largely figurative, it was pragmatic to give these motifs names which are descriptive.  Sydney Art in the general scheme of Australian rock art There is continuing debate regarding the geographic and chronological organisation of rock  art  styles  across Australia  (McCarthy  1988;  Bednarik  1988; Morwood  2002;  Franklin  2004)  although there has been little empirically based progress made on Maynard’s (1976) tripartite  model. Maynard’s model saw a pan-continental, relatively homogenous engraving style (mainly  tracks and circles) - the Panaramitee - replaced by a series of more regionally diverse but simple  (engraving and pigment) art styles, the Simple Figurative. The Complex-Figurative was thought  to then follow, this being a more complex (pigment and engraving) group of styles restricted  mainly to the north-west of the continent.    Increasing  difficulties  are  encountered  by  this  model  as  the  result  of  the  proliferation  of  data  (and  dating  evidence)  from  around  the  country.    Some  complex  figurative  art  (e.g.  Bradshaw  figures  in  the Kimberley)  has  been  found  to  have  significant  antiquity  (Watchman  10‘Petroglyphs’ and ‘Engravings’ are used interchangeably throughout this monograph to refer to the rock art images  of the Sydney Basin. Both terms imply that various techniques have been applied by the artists, removing the stone  matrix to form the resultant image. ‘Petroglyph’ as a term has been long-used in the Australian art literature (e.g.  Worms 1954, McCarthy 1962, Maynard 1977), but it is generally not as popular amongst Australian archaeologists as  ‘engraving’. The NPWS (now AHIMS) Site Register refers to this type of art as ‘Engravings’. terra australis 27 43 </page> <page sequence="2"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange 1993b; Roberts et al.  1997). The  dynamic  figures  of Kakadu  have  also  been  argued  to  have  considerable antiquity (Chaloupka 1977, 1985, 1994; Haskovec 1992; Taçon and Chippindale  1993) and indeed some have older than established Panaramitee dates (e.g. Watchman 1993b).  Complex engraved anthropomorphic motifs of great antiquity have now been recorded in the  Calvert Ranges (McDonald and Veth 2006) as have ancient figurative forms i.e., embellishments  of archaic faces in a number of arid contexts (McDonald 2005b). This creates the most serious  challenge to Maynard’s tripartite sequence. Increasingly the Panaramitee has been found to  demonstrate significant regional heterogeneity (Morwood 1979; Rosenfeld 1991; Rosenfeld et al.  1981; Franklin 1988, 1991, 2004) and localised style graphics are argued to date to the earliest  production of engraved art throughout the arid zone (McDonald 2005b). The dating evidence  does support a late Pleistocene antiquity for the Panaramitee (Rosenfeld 1993). But there is  increasing evidence for continuity of this graphic tradition over time – particularly throughout the  Western Desert in engraved art (McDonald and Veth 2007), in central Australian engraved and  pigment art and body painting (McDonald 2005c, Rosenfeld 2002) and in several eastern regional  assemblages, including the Sydney Basin.   The real problem for the Maynard model with the early dates for complex figurative art  is that it is obvious that there is not clear diachronic change from an early, highly structured and  non-iconic tradition to the later proliferation of figurative (iconic) styles, with increasing design  complexity. More recent research (e.g. Rosenfeld and Smith 2002, McDonald 2005c, McDonald  and Veth 2006, Ross 2005) has attempted to explore the social mechanisms likely to have been in  place for this to occur – and it seems clear that further dating evidence is likely to demonstrate that  an early production of highly complex signalling behaviour accompanied the earliest uses of the  arid zone – much as has been seen with the use of art throughout Europe during the Palaeolithic.    A vast number of regional Simple Figurative art bodies have now been documented across  the country (Cole and Trezise 1992; David 1992, 1994; David and Cole 1990; Flood 1987; Gunn  1983, 1995, 2000, 2003; Hatte 1992; Layton 1992a; McDonald 1998a, 1999; McDonald and Veth  2006; Morwood 1984, 1988, 1992b; Officer 1984, 1992; Ross 1997, 2003). While being cohesive  style regions – usually defined by bio-geological regions - internal variation (both synchronic and  diachronic) is found in these.    The  rock  art  of  the  Sydney  Basin  fits  the  definition  for  the  Simple  Figurative  styles  (Maynard  1976;  Franklin  1984,  2004).   Maynard’s model  predicts  that  this  art  is  a  relatively  recent (Holocene) phenomenon which is supported by this region’s archaeological context. Her  original definition still provides a good general description of the region’s art. the style  is dominated by figurative motifs  ...  the majority of  (these)  ...  conform(ing)  to a  pattern of crude naturalism. Whether the motif is engraved or painted, in outline or solid  form, it usually consists of a very simple silhouette of a human or animal model. Most  portrayals are strongly standardised. Human beings are depicted frontally, animals and birds  in profile, snakes and lizards from above. Normally only the minimum visual requirements  for recognition of the motif are fulfilled by the shape of the figure. (Maynard 1976:200-1) Certain variations to her definition are necessitated by the current research. For instance, human  figures are sometime depicted in profile, while some animals (e.g. the echidna) are not always  (Officer 1984, McDonald 1987). Franklin’s work on macropods and men in the region indicates  that Form, Technique and Motif  are equally  important  in differentiating between  the different  regional Simple Figurative styles (Franklin 1984:89). Each of these assemblage characteristics is  equally able to provide stylistic information which can characterise the region (see also McDonald  1993b). This is significant when evaluating quantitative as opposed to qualitative data (viz. Ashton  1983), and for the analyses undertaken for this research.  terra australis 27 44 </page> <page sequence="3"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin previous work in the Sydney region – the growth of a data base The art of the Sydney region has long had a fascination for European observers (e.g. Phillip 1789)  and more recently rock art analysts. The first major publication of systematic rock art recordings  from the Sydney region was by W.D. Campbell (1899). Campbell recorded (from the back of his  horse) a vast number of (mainly) engraving sites encountered during his duties as Government  Surveyor.    From the 1940’s onwards  there was an  increase  in  the publication of engraving sites  in  the region. Fred McCarthy was the most prolific recorder and publisher (see bibliography) over  a  forty  year  period.  Ian  Sim was  another  prolific  recorder  with  his  published material  being  augmented by an enormous body of field notes and drawings, now archived by the AHIMS as the  ‘Sim Collection’. John Lough also recorded a large number of sites; many re-recordings of earlier  recorders. These, however, were not made accessible to subsequent researchers and very few are  published.   While early interpretations of the Sydney engravings were based loosely on borrowed  ethnographic  material  from  other  regions  (McCarthy  1939a,  Elkin  1949)  the  first  systematic  analysis of this art was undertaken when Lesley Maynard (then McMah) undertook her Honours  research in 1965. This was the first quantitative analysis of any body of art in Australia, the aim  being ‘(to) produce, first a typology of the engravings, and second, a spatial distribution of traits,  based on the typology’ (McMah 1965:7). The results of the analysis (which involved the use of  hand-sorted punch cards) indicated that: 1)   there are definite patterns of distribution in both north-south and east-west planes;    and, 2)  the differences between one end of the range and the other may be ascribed to cultural  causes - except those obviously resulting from the stimulus of different environments.  (McMah 1965:75) McMah’s geographic divisions were too coarse to allow more than a glimpse of trends from  north to south, but she did identify two distinct artistic units. One of these was located around  the Upper Hawkesbury while the other was south of Botany Bay. She distinguished these areas  largely by the presence of particular motifs. The first of these broad style areas has not survived  the proliferation of data. The boundary for the second style area has been redefined as the Georges  River (McDonald 1985a).  Since McMah’s seminal work, research has been directed at localised assemblages and/ or specific research questions. Konecny (1981) was concerned with both engraved and pigment  art and investigated possible aggregation locales (viz. Conkey 1980) within the Sydney area.  While identifying no specific aggregation locales, Konecny suggested that functionally similar  sites could be identified in different areas in both media.    Laurajane Smith’s work was concerned with identifying archaeological patterning across  ethnographically reported tribal boundaries (Smith 1983:1). Her analysis was based in the  Mangrove Creek/Macdonald River area, and involved both art components. Smith tested the  linguistic boundary between the Darkingung and Guringai groups using Mangrove Creek (not  Mooney Mooney Creek: Capell 1970:22; Map 1). Thus her analysis characterises variation within  the Darkingung language area. Topography was considered to be a primary factor contributing to  stylistic variation here.    Officer (1984) examined the art of the Campbelltown area on the Georges River. A sample  of 57 shelter art sites (SPG 1983) was used to explore and describe the formal variability within  a local body of art. Officer formulated a detailed hierarchical motif classification and argued for  both functional and ‘casual’ interpretations for the considerable heterogeneity identified in this  art body. An interrelatedness of motifs across the two art components was perceived, and Officer  terra australis 27 45 </page> <page sequence="4"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange identified strong ties between the coast and hinterland, despite a linguistic boundary and other  evidence for a cultural dichotomy here.    Franklin’s  (1984) work  explored Maynard’s  (1976)  definition  of  the  Simple  Figurative  styles, and was thus involved with comparing the Sydney region with regional assemblages from  Port Hedland, Cobar, south-east Cape York and the Grampians. This analysis confirmed previous  conclusions made by McMah about the Sydney region.    Little art research has been achieved in conjunction with Cultural Heritage Management  work, partly because the majority of urban development in the Sydney region occurs on the  Cumberland Plain (see Figure 1.1) where there is no rock art. In several instances, however, a  research oriented approach has been achieved (McDonald and Smith 1984, McDonald 1988a).   The Sydney Basin Art Style: a current definition Schema The word ‘schema’ is used to denote the manner of depiction (or abstraction) of an image from  the object that is being depicted.  A motif is a recurrent visual image which has a particular arrangement of components ...  motifs are therefore the objectified expressions of schemata - the standardised pictorial forms  which result from a consistent mental template (consistent with the cultural group of the  artist). (Maynard 1977:396)  The art of the Sydney Basin has been described as a Simple Figurative style, because of the  high level of recognition (for modern etic observers) between the art and a ‘natural’ assemblage  (human figures, animals, birds, fish etc.). Simple Figurative also implies that the schema is not a  complicated one: that a minimum amount of detail is provided.  The schemata used for the two art components in the Sydney Basin are very similar. This is  manifested in the Motif range used, in the Form of these and - in particular - the general Character  of the regional motif assemblage (as defined by Maynard 1977). The main difference between  the two components is Technique but also Size. Size differences are mostly due to the differences  in ‘canvas’ size (i.e. available rock surface). Extremely large motifs (life-size or larger) are  occasionally found in shelter art assemblages (e.g. AHIMS #’s 45-2-48, 45-2-11811), while very  small motifs (miniature or smaller than life-size) sometimes occur on open engraving sites (e.g.  AHIMS #’s 45-2-224, 45-6-43).   There are also some differences in Form. Motif form for the pigment art comprises a variety  of outline, infilled and combination forms. The vast majority (97%) of the engraved motifs are  outline  only. The  only  consistently  infilled  engravings  are  culture  heroes which  are  generally  decorated with series of pecked lines of dots.  Intaglio forms (i.e. fully pecked infill) are extremely  rare. Chronology Some Panaramitee  style  sites  (cf. Maynard’s  1976  definition)  have  been  identified within  the  region. These assemblages contain predominantly tracks and circles produced in pecked intaglio,  not pebraded outline form. Interestingly, these occur almost exclusively within shelter sites. It is  possible that residual Panaramitee motifs are also located in open contexts, and that weathering  and the association with figurative motifs is masking their presence (McDonald 1993b). 11AHIMS site identification numbers are used in the text in preference to the sample numbers used for sites in the  multivariate analyses. This form of identification is potentially more meaningful to the reader (McDonald 1994:  Appendices 5 and 6 identifies sites by both means).  terra australis 27 46 </page> <page sequence="5"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin Figure 5.2: Engravings in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park.

These figures  represented 39.5% and 32.7% (respectively) of  the known sites  in  the  region  in  1994. Based on these samples, the following regional characteristics of the art assemblages are  summarised:  motif and technique information;  average assemblage size;  topographic location;  site associations;    and,  the unique or unusual aspects of each component (e.g. engravings within shelters, the  occurrence of open pigment art, vertical engravings etc.). The open engraving sites Assemblage Size The average engraving assemblage contains 10.9 motifs. The largest site in the region (Burragurra;  NPWS # 45-3-404) contains 174 motifs; and there are many sites (137: 19.1%) which contain  only one motif.  The majority of sites (83.4%) have less than 16 motifs and about two-thirds (66.1%) have  less  than  eight motifs  (Figure 5.1). Sites with  larger  numbers  of motifs  are  rare,  and only 61  engraving sites (8.5%) have more than 30 motifs present. Four sites only (0.6%) have more than  100 motifs present.  figure 5.1: engraving  Sites. percentage  frequency of different  assemblage sizes. Site Nature and Topographic Location The vast majority (97%) of open engraving sites are located on horizontal sandstone platforms.  Only twenty-two open engraving sites have been identified on vertical boulders, most of these  terra australis 27 51 </page> <page sequence="10"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange adjacent to waterways. These engravings on flat surfaces face the water. Several engravings on  vertical faces also have been found on low clifflines adjacent to major creeks: others are located  on the outside wall(s) of shelters. Given the interior dripline definition for shelters, this category  excludes those which are located inside shelters.   One only open pigment site is known (AHIMS # 45-6-1411). This consists of a red pigment  drawing on an open cliff face protected from the elements by a slight rocky projection. This motif  is on Berowra Creek and is associated with vertical engravings.  Topographic position is summarised according to three broad categories: ridge tops, hill  sides and valley bottoms. These locations were defined by Attenbrow (1987) and her definitions  were used: the cut-off point for ridge tops and valley bottoms is 5m in elevation below and above  (respectively) the ridgeline and valley bottom.   Distance from permanent drinking water was also recorded for each site. Distance to a  second order stream was the general rule (McDonald 1996); with distance rounded off to the  nearest 50m. Sites recorded by me during fieldwork had a greater precision. This  type of data  belies the presence of springs, rock holes and soaks which would have provided water, at least  periodically, for knowledgeable Aboriginal inhabitants.  More than half of the engraving sites (401 sites: 55.9%) are located on ridgelines.  Hill  side locations are the next most common (296 sites: 41.2%) while valley bottom locations are  relatively rare (20 sites: 2.8%). Almost half (45%) of those in valley bottom locations were vertical  engraving sites, on boulders adjacent to major waterways (e.g. Berowra and Cowan Creeks).  Slightly more than half (59%) of the vertical engravings, however, are located more than 5m in  elevation above the water and therefore in the hillside zone.  The average distance to drinking water from any engraving site in the region is 650m and  the maximum distance is approximately 3km. The minimum distance is 2m (on-site rock wells  and/or creeklines). Site Associations The main site type association for open engraving sites is grinding grooves, although this is  fairly rare. Only 96 engraved platforms (13.4%) also having grinding grooves. Water channels  (i.e. pecked and abraded lines which direct water seepage around potholes: McDonald and Smith  1984) occur on a small proportion of engraving sites (22 - 3.1%). All sites with water channels  also have grinding grooves present. Of the sites which contain engravings and grinding grooves,  23% also have water channels.  Only a very small proportion of engraving sites have shelter art associated with them. By  definition, this association can only occur when the open platform and shelter occur within the  one (usually massive) outcrop of sandstone. Less than 10 (1.3%) such occurrences are noted in the  sample. This does not indicate that Aboriginal artists did not perceive of a contextual relationship  between the two art forms. Rather, the location for the production of the two art forms was, by the  nature of the two physical contexts, quite distinct. Engraved motifs amongst pigment art within  shelter art sites indicate that the two components were not strictly separated. This is discussed  further below.  Another rare association for engraving sites is the association with stone arrangements (4:  0.6%). It is notable, however, that 17 such recorded site associations do occur within the region  (but the art assemblages of 13 of these have not been recorded in sufficient detail for inclusion in  the current sample). While stone arrangements are unlikely to be found on an engraving site, it is  likely (21%) for a stone arrangement to have engravings associated with it.   Very few site records indicate an association of archaeological deposit on open engraving  sites (e.g. stone artefacts). This may be due to recorder indifference (or ignorance) to this type of  evidence as many engraving sites do have sparse scatters of lithic artefacts in pockets of soils and/ or vegetation (personal observation). Open exposures of sandstone generally do not encourage the  terra australis 27 52 </page> <page sequence="11"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin build up of deposit, and it may well be that artefact manufacture rarely occurred in conjunction  with the activity of engraving.   While open engravings have sparse associated evidence, the majority (&gt;95%) of the vertical  engraving sites are associated with extensive open midden deposits. Motifs A total of 7,804 motifs were analysed from the 717 engravings sites in the sample (see Table  5.1 and Table 5.2). The most common motif in the region is the human footprint (‘mundoe’ -  17%), followed by unidentifiable motifs12 (15%) and fish (12%). Several other individual motifs  figure reasonably strongly: bird tracks and macropods (7% each) and men (5%). The remainder,  however, are present in relatively low percentages.   The clumped motif percentage frequencies (Table 5.2) clearly reveal the subject preferences  of  the  region  and  indicate  that Maynard’s  definition  for  the  region  needs  refining. There  is  a  focus on tracks, followed by a preference for marine animals, land animals, anthropomorphic  representations and items of material culture. Birds and ‘other’ motifs (circles, complex-non- figurative motifs and contact motifs) are less common (see Figure 5.2-5.9).   Maynard’s distinction between the Panaramitee and Simple Figurative styles is based not  only on differing techniques and forms, but also on the motif ranges and preferences. Bird and  animal tracks dominate the Panaramitee at 60% (Maynard 1976:193). Conversely the Simple  Figurative was described as having predominantly figurative motifs (78% for Sydney - Maynard  1976:193) with animal and human tracks ‘nowhere near as dominant as in the Panaramitee style’  (Maynard 1976: 200-201). Maynard estimated that track motifs accounted for 5% of the Sydney  engravings. The current data overturn this perception: while tracks in the Sydney Basin are not  as predominant as in the Panaramitee, they are still the dominant motif type in the region. The  possibility that some of the Sydney region’s macropod and bird tracks on open site are residual  Panaramitee style is discussed below. The Georges River style boundary The presence  of  a major  style  boundary was  identified  in  the  south  of  the  region by McMah  (1965) and confirmed by the first stage of the SRAP (McDonald 1985a). A number of motifs are  completely absent from sites south of the Georges River. The number and density of engraving  sites diminished south of the Georges River (open engraving sites are absent from the artistic  repertoire south of  the region: Officer 1992, 1993). While the geographic distribution of some  motifs can be explained in terms of environment13 several motifs are restricted to either side of  the Georges River ‘style’ boundary (McDonald 1985a).  South of the Georges River:  there are no profile anthropomorphs, culture heroes, emus and contact motifs;  there is a much higher proportion of unidentified motifs;  the proportions of tracks (particularly mundoes) are appreciably lower;  anthropomorphic, marine and terrestrial depictions are more numerous and there is a  reduced motif repertoire and lower number of tracks.  12Unidentifiable motifs are generally an indication of indistinct or incomplete engravings rather than motifs outside  the motif classification. 13Whales are restricted to the coast and appear to be concentrated around Broken Bay: all are east of Berowra Creek.  These continue down the coastline. There is another cluster of whales around the mouth of the Port Hacking, and the  most southerly example is located just south of Bundeena. terra australis 27 53 </page> <page sequence="12"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Table 5.1: The Sydney Basin engraving component: motif frequency and %f.

Macropods and other zoomorphs are the most obvious indicator of this: these motifs are  depicted in profile with all four legs south of the Georges River, while to the north they are shown  with only two legs [there are two known exceptions to this: a macropod located just south of Port  Jackson with four legs; and another near the Lane Cove River; personal observation].   The whales south of the Georges River are less highly stylised than their northern  counterparts, with few containing decorative infill or anatomical details (such as gills, eyes).   Another difference is the method of depicting echidnae. North of the Georges River these  are depicted in profile; to the south they are depicted from beneath as ‘pelts’ (Officer 1984:49).  Officer  also makes  the  observation  that  there  is  similarly  a mixed  perspective  (‘simultaneous  projection’) demonstrated in the pigment art around Campbelltown (Officer 1984:49). The beaked  anthropomorphs are a good example of this stylistic convention. terra australis 27 54 </page> <page sequence="13"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin  These differences are examined further below in light of the trends and patterns observed  in the shelter art component (see below). The Shelter Art sites Assemblage Size The average shelter art site assemblage contains 26.4 motifs. A total of 14,424 motifs were counted  from the sample of 546 sites. The largest assemblage (Swinton’s; AHIMS # 45-3-252) contains  857 motifs. A small a number of sites (31: 5.7%) contain only a single motif.  The majority of sites (478: 87.5%) have &lt;30 motifs while almost half (285: 52.2%) have  &lt;10 motifs. Only 30 sites (5.5%) in the region have more than 100 motifs; eight sites only have  more than 200 motifs (Figure 5.10). figure 5.10: Shelter Art  Sites: assemblage size  information. While showing the same general pattern as the engraved assemblage (i.e. a proliferation of very  small sites with a moderate number of medium-sized sites and a few very large sites) the shelter art  assemblages are slightly larger than their engraved counterparts. The average pigment assemblage  is twice as large as the average engraved assemblage, while largest shelter art site contains almost  five times as many motifs as the largest engraving site.  Site Nature and Topographic Location All of the art in this component occurs within sandstone overhangs or shelters. No decorated deep  caves occur in the region. Art within shelters is commonly located on the back wall, but often  occurs on the ceiling and also on the inside lip of the dripline. The entire range of differently-sized  shelters has been decorated, although this aspect has not been quantified. The smallest recorded  art shelter site was ‘Little end shelter’ which measures 2.5m x 2.0m x 1.0m (see Figure 2.8). The  largest recorded art shelter is at ‘Sphinx Trig’ in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park (AHIMS #45- 6-258) which measures 40m x 10m x 8m and contains 91 motifs.   The majority of shelter sites (70%) is located on the hillslopes, while the remainder are  fairly evenly divided between the ridge top zone (13.7%) and the valley bottom zone (16.7%).  The average distance to permanent drinking water for this site type is 262m.  The greatest distance  from water recorded was 2km while one site was recorded as having water permanently on-site  terra australis 27 55 </page> <page sequence="14"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange - with a creekline flowing over the shelter. Given most shelter sites are on hillslopes or in valley  bottoms, this increased proximity to water compared to engravings is not surprising.  Site Associations The major site type association for this art component is occupation deposit: both archaeological  and midden deposits. Of the sample used, 138 sites (25.3%) had surface evidence for occupation  deposit. Nineteen sites (13.7%) also contained grinding grooves.  Differences were observed in sites either side of the Georges River. Art sites south of this  River have a much lower association with deposit (25/181 sites: 13.8%) than the northern sites  (113/365 sites: 31.0%). South of the Georges River, seven of the 25 sites with deposit (28%)  also contain grinding grooves; while north of the Georges River 12 of the 113 sites with deposit  (10.6%) also contain grinding grooves.   Observer bias may be responsible for creating some of these differences and it is likely  that the proportion of shelters with both art and deposit is in fact much higher. Indeed, many  of the sites recorded during Stages II and III of the Rock Art Project were found to contain  signs of occupation deposit which had not been recorded on the original recording. Many art  recorders have been interested in recording only the art and not other less obvious forms of  occupation evidence. Of the 214 shelter art sites in the current sample recorded by systematic  and/or detailed survey (Attenbrow 1987, Gunn 1981, McDonald 1986a, 1987, 1988a, 1990b)  122 sites  (57%) also have occupation deposit. Only 43  (20%) of  these  site definitely have no  occupation deposit (i.e. they have sloping rock floors). Many of these sites (49; 23%) have floors  assessed as having potential for archaeological deposit (PAD). Taphonomic factors contribute to  this problem. Attenbrow (1987) tested shelters with PAD and revealed that almost 90% of these  contain subsurface deposits.   Twenty-six shelter art sites (5%) also contain grinding grooves. Nine of these occur south  of the Georges River, 17 to the north. The incidence of pigment art and grinding grooves without  occupation deposit is rare. Motifs A large proportion (41%) of the 14,424 motifs counted for this art component is unidentifiable  (Table  5.3).  This  reflects  the  nature  of  the  art  -  complex,  less  formalised  and  often  heavily  superimposed. Often the poor preservation of the art results from instability of the sandstone  surfaces within shelters (Spate and Jennings 1983; although see Watchman 1994).    The average number of identifiable motifs in the region is 15.4. Swinton’s shelter, as well as  having the greatest number of motifs recorded, also has the highest number of identifiable motifs -  653. There are numerous sites (51) which contain no identifiable motifs. The vast majority of the  unidentified motifs are depictive14 and dry pigment (i.e. drawn). Some are painted and some are  also stencilled (see below).    Of the identifiable motifs, stencilled hands and hand variations predominate (49%). This  reflects  the  dominance of  stencilling  as  a  technique,  but  also  the  fact  that  the  depictive  art  is  significantly less formalised. It also reflects a degree of unavoidable recorder bias: a partial hand  stencil is still identifiable as part of a stencil of a hand, whereas the classification of depictive motifs  require that motifs with insufficient diagnostic information must be classified as ‘unidentified’. A  quadruped without legs and/or tail could be either a kangaroo or a dingo: and is thus recorded as  unidentifiable.    Of the identifiable depictive motifs, macropods are the dominant subject (9%) followed by  anthropomorphs (7%) and other land animals (5.5%). All of the motif classes used in the engraved  14The term ‘depictive’ is used to describe non-stencilled motifs, this including both figurative and non-figurative  forms.  terra australis 27 56 </page> <page sequence="15"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin assemblage are also present in this component, although percentage differences do occur (section  5.6, below).

These will be discussed in detail below. Technique The recording of technical information for unidentified motifs has a demonstrated a more complete  understanding of the overall range of techniques employed in this art component (Table 5.5). If  only identifiable motifs had been used for these analyses, stencilling would have dominated the  results to a greater extent than is real. The majority of the art (66.1%) is depictive. Stencilling is  common (32.6%) while engraving is rare (1.3%).   Of the 9,527 depictive pigmented motifs recorded, the vast majority (91%) are drawn. Most  of the remainder (8%) have been painted, while a small number (1%) are drawn and painted. These  motifs are predominantly (93%) monochrome. Bichrome (i.e. two colours) motifs are relatively  rare (7%), while polychrome (i.e. three or more colours) is rarer (1%). Most of the polychrome  motifs consist of three colours (usually red, black and white) although several of motifs in this  category include four colours (yellow also).    The way the database was counted does not allow for the splitting colour information  according to stencilled or depictive motifs. The following colour summary is thus based on a  combination of the two techniques.  Despite the dominance of stencilling, black15 is the predominant colour used in the region,  accounting for 46.2% of the pigment art. White is the next most dominant (34.6%), followed by  red (16.6%) and yellow (2.8%). These colour proportions vary significantly in localised areas of  the Basin (see Chapter 9).  Stencilling is mainly restricted to white and red pigment. Yellow stencils occur in localised  areas and, as indicated, black stencils are rare. The use of two colours within one stencil (bichrome)  occurs, as has the mixing of pigments to achieve non-primary colours – e.g. the mixture of red and  white pigment to make pink. Off-white (cream) stencils have also been recorded, but these are  more likely to have resulted from the use of less pure pipeclay. Bichrome and black stencils had  not been documented in the region prior to this work.   Of the 9,715 depictive motifs (engraved and pigment), most are in outline and infill form  (38%),  although  outline-only  forms  are  nearly  as  common  (34%).  Solid  infill motifs  are  less  common (28%). Linear (geometric or patterned) infill in depictive motifs rare (2.5%: see Figure  5.12).  The assemblages at 57 shelter sites include engraved motifs. While the proportion of  engraved motifs within the entire shelter art assemblage is very low (c.1%), the percentage of  sites at which this technique has been employed is fairly high – c.10% of the regional sample.  Engraved motifs within shelter art sites are another feature which differentiates art production  on either side of the Georges River. While there is not a complete absence of engravings from  the shelter  sites south of  the Georges River,  the proportions vary significantly. There are only  two such sites (out of 181 sites: 1.1%) south of the Georges River; the other 55 sites (15.4%) are  located north of Port Jackson and the Parramatta River.  Most of these engraving are pecked tracks or circles. However, three distinct types occur  (McDonald 1991). These are (Figure 5.16, Figure 6.7, Figure 8.7):  1) fully pecked, intaglio motifs; usually of circles, or bird and/or kangaroo tracks;  2) miniature Sydney style engravings; these are the same form, character and technique as  the open engraving site variety, but in miniature (i.e. &lt; 20cm max. dimension); and, 15Black pigment is very rarely used for stencilling. Black stencils have been recorded at Yengo 1 and are reported in  one site in the Woronora catchment (Caryll Sefton, pers. comm.).  terra australis 27 58 </page> <page sequence="17"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin  3) incised or scratched motifs, usually incorporated with pigment motifs.

The variable number column indicates the numbering system used in subsequent  quantitative analyses. comparison of the two art contexts: Sheltered and open Art Sites The Sydney Basin with its two synchronous art forms is unique. In no other area of Australia does  this occur to the same extent. In most regions one medium has been practised to the exclusion of  the other (e.g. Arnhem Land, Kimberley, Pilbara, Laura), or the two are diachronically distinct  (western NSW, central Queensland).  The two overriding assumptions about the Sydney region art components are that they  are relatively recent and that they are roughly contemporaneous. Given the assumption of  contemporaneity,  the  two art  components allow quite  specific questions of comparison. These  questions can be at a very simple level.  How do the two components compare in regard to the motifs used? and, How do the distributions in one component, compare with those of the other component?  At a higher level, stylistic patterning may be attributed to spheres of mediation in the society which  produced the art. The meaning of the art cannot be explored, as the artists are no longer present.  But by establishing certain parameters, the analysis of the two components enable a detailed  picture to emerge of how the art may have functioned across the region. General comparisons are  explored first.  Assemblage Size Sheltered art assemblages are generally 2.5 times larger than open engraving assemblages. The  largest pigment site contains five times as many motifs as the largest engraving site. This could  be due to the fact that the average engraving’s production time would be significantly greater than  terra australis 27 65 </page> <page sequence="24"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange that for any pigment motif (Clegg 1981). The differing motif totals may reflect a commensurate  amount of artistic activity.   Interestingly, both components demonstrate similar proportions of larger to small  assemblages: there is a relative infrequency of very large site assemblages, but a proliferation  of small, perhaps single episode sites. This suggests that there are particular art foci around the  region, and that these may represent a different type of activity to the interspersed sites with less  intensive art production (e.g. casual sites vs. aggregation sites).  Topographic location A longstanding preconception about Sydney engravings has been that these were located on  ridgelines while pigment art shelters were located in valleys. This division is not substantiated by  the current work. Certainly, only a small proportion of the shelter art sites are located on ridgelines,  but relatively equal proportions of engraving sites occur on hillslopes and on ridgelines.  A comparison of engraving sites on ridgelines with those on hillslopes and in valley  bottoms has been undertaken (McDonald 1998b) to determine the relative stylistic homogeneity  of these. A sample from Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park (within a single language group) was  used for this comparison: topographic diversity here is pronounced and there is a high number of  engraving sites generally. As well as open engraving sites on horizontal platforms, engravings on  vertical surfaces close to the water’s edge also occur. This analysis confirmed stylistic differences  which can be explained in terms of topographic location and social context.  The average distance to drinking water from shelter sites is considerably less than the  average distance from the open engraving sites. A greater association between art and occupation  evidence in shelters is one possible explanation for this, especially since the contemporaneity of  art and occupation can often be demonstrated (Chapter 6). The fact that more shelter sites occur  in valley bottom and hillside locations (and are topographically closer to creeklines) could also  explain this finding. Motif The motif range and preferences of the two art components were compared. This had not been  done by previous research in the region (Franklin 1984, McMah 1965, Maynard 1976, Officer  1984, Smith 1983) and, as indicated above, is not possible in any other Australian art region.    This has been done at a simple level (Table 5.1 and Table 5.3; Figure 5.23 and Figure 5.24)  and on the basis of variance described by multivariate analyses (Chapters 11 and 12).  There are obvious similarities and differences between the two components’ motif  assemblages. In both components, tracks dominate the identifiable motifs (Table 5.2 and Table  5.4). With the shelter art sites, this is due to the overall predominance of hand stencils; in the  engraving component it results from the predominance of human tracks (‘mundoes’) and bird and  macropod tracks. Given stencils are likely individual or personalised markers (Moore 1977), and  that hand stencils place the artist very firmly amongst the art, the presence of human tracks in great  numbers amongst the engravings is an intriguing similarity. Is it a coincidence? The insertion of  people into both art assemblages does suggest a semiotic implication, although engraved mundoes  are not in the same representational class as stencilled hands: one is conventional and the other is  replication.   Another similarity between the two components is found in the proportions of  anthropomorphs, birds and terrestrial animals. Major difference between the two components can  be seen in the frequency of marine depictions and material objects (high in engraving sites; low  in shelter art sites). The greater number of ‘other’ motifs in the shelter art assemblage is partly  indicative of the more ‘stylistically unfettered nature’ of this medium (Officer 1984:72).   The proportion of unidentifiable motifs within  the shelter art component  is significantly  greater than that found in engraved sites (41%:15.2%). This is partly due to the nature of  terra australis 27 66 </page> <page sequence="25"> Chapter 5: the rock art of the Sydney Basin production and to the more fragile nature of the shelter art generally. Pigment art has a greater  susceptibility to natural deterioration due to the instability of sandstone surfaces e.g. surface  exfoliation, pigment flaking etc. except perhaps where silica coatings have helped to stabilised  these (Hughes 1978, Watchman 1994). The more ad hoc nature of pigment art production (i.e.  freehand drawing using unprepared surfaces/pigments) may also have contributed to this high  proportion of unidentifiable motifs. Superimpositionning of motifs (and the obscuring of earlier  art) is more common in pigment sites then on engraving sites.

Motif classification (excluding  unidentified motifs). Composition It cannot be assumed that any rockshelter or engraving assemblage is a single artistic event;  indeed many pigment assemblages suggest several artistic phases. Occasionally, shelter and open  engraving sites indicate that the assemblage was probably produced in a single artistic episode.  Compositions  include  recognisable  ‘scenes’  (hunting,  fishing,  corroborees  etc.)  or  repetitive  designs (using combinations of motifs, often stencils).  Most of the vertical engraving sites consist of complex compositions involving the sharing  of internal lines/features for decorative effect, and a positioning of the design relative to the shape  of the available surface. While composition is often recognisable in open engraving sites, by  association and positioning of motif type (e.g. the Ku-ring-gai Fish Shoal site: Campbell 1899:  62; or the overlapping whales at West Head: McCarthy 1954: Figure 9) it is never as conclusively  so as in the vertical sites (Figure 11.19).  Compositions within the shelter art sites take the form of obvious motif organisations  [e.g. Native Animals (McDonald et al.  1990: Figure 5.2), Dingo  and Horned Anthropomorph  (Macintosh 1965: Plate 1)], as well as the positioning of hand and other stencils to make patterns  or  repetitive designs  [e.g. Devils Hole, Cafe’s Cave  (Figure 5.17), Swinton’s]. These  types of  compositions are good indications for the simultaneous production of many sites’ assemblages.  terra australis 27 67 Motif </page> <page sequence="26"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 s mo rph po thr o an re str ial  an im als bir ds ma rin e a nim als ma ter ial  ob jec ts tra ck s oth er ter Engravings 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 s mo rph po thr o an re str ial  an im als bir ds ma rin e a nim als ma ter ial  ob jec ts tra ck s oth er ter Shelter art Figure 5.24: Subject preference for the two art contexts.
