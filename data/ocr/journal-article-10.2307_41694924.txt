<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF DEITY IN THE NIRUKTA AND PÜRVAMJMÄ1ÜSÄ By P. D. Navathe 1. The deities play an important role in the Vedic hymns which mainly contain descriptions of their exploits, favours done by them towards human beings and others and prayers addressed to them by the seers for fulfilment of worldly desires. The deities also form an essential part of sacrifice which represents the practical side of the Vedic religion. Attempts have been made since quite early times to divulge the nature of the deities. Even in the hymns there are clear indications of awareness regarding the existence of super- human agency controlling the activities of animal and physical world.1 Curi- osity is often expressed about the nature of supernatural powers and the way in which they function and control the course of the world.2 The enquiry about the nature of deities continues in the exegetical Vedãngas. It is Yãska, who, for the first time, starts in a systematic manner the discussion on the nature of deities. In the introductory chapter of his Nirukta ( = Nir ) he states that one of the aims of the Nir is to closely exa- mine the directions which occur in the context of ritual performance with reference to the deity.3 He fully discusses this topic in the opening sections of the latter half of his work4 which deals with the Vedic deities ( Daivata - kãnda ). After 'aska the problem of deities is further pursued by the ancient Indian systems of philosophy. The Purva Mímãfnsâ ( = PMïm), which aims at investigating the nature of Dharma that chiefly consists in the performance of sacrifices, is concerned with the deities as they form an essential factor of the sacrifice. In the Devatãdhikarana5 of the ninth Adhyäya of the Mi mõmsã Sutra ( = MimS ) Jaimini treats the topic of the place of deities in the sacrifice. The elaborate exposition of this topic in the Sãbarabhãsya lays down the basis of the view-point of Mïmâmsakas on the concept of deity. 1 Cf. ev 10. 121. 2 Cf.

A careful study of the discussion of this topic in the Nir and PMim reveals that the discussion in the former has a close bearing on that in the latter. Hence a comparison of the views in the two disciplines is under- taken in this article. The aforesaid discussion centres round the following two points : ( 1 ) Do the deities confer the reward on the devotee ? ( 2 ) Do they possess anthropomorphic or physical form ? 3. Yâska's view on the first point is indirectly expressed in the definition of the deity of a mantra which is given as follows : yatkama rsir yasyãm devatõyãm ãrthapatyam icchan stutim prayuňkte taddaivatas sa maniro bhavati / Nir 7. 1 "A particular verse is said to pertain to a particular deity, to whom a seer addresses his panegyric with a particular desire, and from whom he wishes to obtain mastery over objects. " The expression ãrthapatyam in the definition can also be understood as referring to the deity in which case it means power possessed by the deity over objects. It is implied that the deity being pleased by the panegyric bestows the desired benefits on the devotee. Yãska classifies the deities under three heads6 according to the regions as : ( 1 ) terrestrial ( e. g., Agni ), ( 2 ) atmospheric ( e. g., Vãyu or Indra ), and ( 3 ) celestial ( e. g., the sun ). They are again divided into two classes7 : ( 1 ) those that are described in hymns ( sãktabhãjah ) and ( 2 ) those that re- ceive oblations ( havirbhãjah ). Yãska mentions two contradictory views about the form possessed by the deities.8 According to one view the deities have anthropomorphic form. The adherents of this view adduce the supporting evidence of the descriptions, which occur in the Veda, of the man-like bodily parts of the deities, the deeds done by them like human beings and so on. The opponents of this view controvert the position on the ground that similar descriptions are met with in connection with inanimate objects also. It appears that Yãska does not fully favour either of these views. As a midway between the two he con- cludes that in fact the deities do possess human form ; however, they have their counterself in the form of action which is unanthropomorphic in appearance.9 6 Nir 7. 5. 7 Nir 7. 13. 8 Nir 7. 6, 7. 9 3îfq Щ' qà | Nir 7. 7.

According to PMim sacrifice is defined as an act of parting with some material in favour of the deity.10 Tt is stated that the act of sacrificing denotes the material, the deity and the action performed taken collectively.11 Now the question which arises here is : which particular one of these three consti- tuents is to be regarded as determining the details such as mantras etc. and the friut aimed at. On this point the following polemics takes place. ( i ) The contention of the Pürvapaksa is as follows : The sacrifice means worship offered to the deity. It is to be looked upon as a sort of reception offered to the guest. Now it is evident that the recipient of the worship is more prominent than the worship itself. So it follows that the deity who is the recipient of the sacrifice is more prominent than the act of sacrifice: Hence it is the deity that prompts or determines the details.12 That the deity receives the sacrifice further implies that it possesses physical form. This is corroborated by the Smrti texts, customs and Mantra- and Arthavãda-passages in the Veda. Moreover, the deities have power over objects of human pursuit13 ( Srthapatya ). When propitiated by means of sacrifice they become pleased and grant the desired benefits to the performer. This is also confirmed by the same three sources. Thus the connection of the deity with the reward is quite evident.14 ( ii ) Now follows the refutation of the prima facie view. We fully accept that the sacrifice is worship offered to the deity. But from this it does not follow that the deity prompts the details or brings about the reward. What we urge is that the problem of the prompter should be decided on the authority of the word of the Veda. Now Vedic statement like svargakãmo yajeta declares that in this case the act of sacrifice is the principal factor and the deity is subordinate as compared to it.13 Hence it is the act of sacrifice, i. е., the apurva accruing from it, which determines the details and brings about the reward.

M. ]</page><page sequence="4">602 ABORI i Amrtamahotsava Volume If it is contended that as the material, the deity and the act together constitute the act of sacrifice they are equally connected with the reward we reply that the material and the deity being accomplished entities serve the purpose of bringing into being the act of sacrifice and are therefore subservi- ent to it. Hence the conclusion is that the act of sacrifice is the prompter, not the deity. The argument that the deity has physical form as well as power over objects holds little water. The evidence of Mantra- and Arthavãda-passages cited in support of this argument is untenable because these passages are to be taken metaphorically and not literally. The Mantras serve to remind of the action to be performed in the context of the ritual. The ArthavSdas com- mend the enjoined act. Thus the injunctive statement ( vidhi ) gives promi- nence to the act of sacrifice of which the deity is merely a part. Moreover, the deity is only a verbal entity as its existence is realised only through the Mantra. The deity is indicated either by a secondary suffix or by a dative suffix or by the wording of the Mantra.16 5. It is evident that Jaimini and Sabara had before them the discussion in the Nir on the nature of deities. It serves for them as the working hypo- thesis which they utilise as the basis for setting up the POrvapaksa. Jaimini adduces arthapatya as one of the hetus in support of the POrvapaksa view. It may be observed that this expression is the key-word in the definition of deity given in the Nir. Jaimini does not refer to the physical form of the deity, which, according to the opponent the deity possesses. This is probably due to the condensed style of the Sfltra. However, this requirement is suppli- mented by Šabara in his elaboration of the topic. In his presentation of the Pflrvapak§a Šabara convincingly shows that there is logical connection bet- ween the two aspects of the opponent's concept of the deity, viz. partaking of the sacrificial oblation and possessing a physical form. The latter has to be presumed on the merit of the former. However, there is no statement in the Nir to that effect. The concept of deity in the Nir is based mainly on the Mantra-portion in the Veda whereas that in the PMïm on the BrShmana- portion and particularly on the v/dW-element in it. The Nir follows the spirit of the Veda while the PMîm adheres to its letter. geliti nírtíčR 5^ ^ II Tantravãrttika on M tm S 2. 2. 23.</page><page sequence="5">Ñavathe : Deity in the Nirukta and Purvamímamsã 603 Bibliography Chatterjee, K.
