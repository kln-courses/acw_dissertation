We are reminded by the advertisements swathing this volume that it is at least the 16th "des beruhmten Verfassers," and that several of its forerunners have attracted the utmost attention and caused the greatest excitement in the Fatherland, fluttering the dovecotes of Church, State, and University. The last and longest of them, Phanomenologie des sittlichen Bewusstseins was reviewed in MIND XIV.; and with that work the present one, resembling it in extensive and</page><page sequence="2">Critical Notices. 289r systematic treatment, is also in its subject closely connected. Die Philosophie des Unbewussten had taught that the Omniscient Uncon- scious strives to attain in man the fullest consciousness in order to convince itself, that positive happiness is a desperate quest, and thus disillusioned to procure freedom from pain or negative happiness by renouncinig existence. The recent ethical treatise exhibited moral progress as the ever clearer recognition that Duty consists in furthering the purpose of the Unconscious Absolute. And the present work treats the history of Religion as an evolution of the consciousness that the same Absolute Divine Spirit is the true object of worship and religious service. The exposition begins from the brutes. That wild animals have no religion is attributed not to their want of the requisite emotional basis, since the higher species display love, gratitude, humility, repen- tance, and other virtues, but rather to their incapacity of observing the natural phenomena most stimulative to religious feelings-the heavens, heavenly bodies, and meteorologic changes. Not that they cannot perceive these things, but, preoccupied by practical needs, they cannot regard them in the right way. Tame animnals, however, espe- cially dogs, appear to deify their master, and in proportion to his mental anrd moral superiority, his goodness and justice: not if he tease the would-be devotees, or associate with them too much on terms of equality. Thus to the brute, spiritual existence is revealed in another before a consciousness of it has arisen in itself, whereas the man can only discover the spirit in nature after having reached the conception of his own. The man's understanding, occasionally free from the task of plotting to satisfy iinmediate wants, begins to direct partially disinterested observation to the heavens; which although at this stage of culture they do not directly concern him, yet indirectly may do so, and thus engage his curiosity. But as such an attitude of mind is toe cold to awaken relioious consciousness, we must consider his susceptibility to aesthetic impressions, especially the sense of sublimity. By a florid sketch of day and night and a turgid description of a thunder-storm the author seeks to impress us with the way the savage would be impressed, and observes that this asthetic awakening gives the warmth of feelino characteristic of religion but wanting to mere curiosity. The resthetir, feelings are aroused not in their pure disinterestedness but perturbed by fear and hope; the storm is not only sublime but devastating; the morning not only beautiful but encouraging; and thus partially disinterested feeling associates itself with partially disinterested understanding. The heavens contemplated in such a temper are seen to be light-giving (a frequent attribute of Divinity) in contrast with darkness ; imperishable in their cyclic recurrence, unlike plants and animals that die and return no more; still s6me- thing besides resplendence and duration belongs to the notion of Deity. We see, however, that this something else is also implicitly present when we remember that the senses of the natural man are so suffused with imagination that- 19</page><page sequence="3">290 Critical Notices. " all the mighty world Of eye and ear, both what they half create And half perceive," is for him an inseparable whole, and all nature alive. He is a born poet and conceives of nature as the modern poet does. The appro- priate objects of primitive man's religious consciousness, therefore, glorious and everlasting, are also eonceived to live or, summing the last two attributes, to be immortal. The gods thus created are not nmerely related to but identical with the sensuous objects that suggest them. Hence there are no idols until the second stage of religious progress, Zoomorphism, when imagination has confounded meteorology with zoology, seeing a snake in the lightning, in the scudding cloud a milk-shedding cow chased by a buill, in the horned moon a dew-shedding cow, and so forth. Zoomorphism everywhere precedes Anthropomorphism, partly because animals furnish easier comparisons with the heavenly bodies, but chiefly because to primitive man animals, exceeding himself in strength and swiftness, the only excellences he appreciates, best represent the power of the gods. It is only at a later stage of culture, when the use of weapons establishes man's superiority, that the human form is preferred foi expressing the divine nature. In representing the gods as beasts or as men, primitive man does not sunder them from the elements in which he first beheld them; nor from one another to the extent of denying their identity. To question whether they are one or many does not occur to him. Such arithmetical opposition, insuperable in our age of understanding, is not,felt in the ages of, imagination. The first state of Religion is not Polytheism but Henotheism. Whilst worshipping any single god, the natural man contemplates the godhead, not to the exclusion of the other goda, nor yet to the neglect of them, but rather-it is hard for a mere man of -understanding to express it. The supremacy of imagi- nation makes this attitude of mind possible, but it is also supported by a certain consciousness of the essential identity of the gods: not indeed a, conscious fconsciousness of it, but an implicit unconscious divination of unity underlying the ostensive multiplicity. With a race inclined to mysticism the implicit unity may absorb the multi- plicity and become Abstract Monism, as we see in Brahmanism. With a race prone to sensuo-us realisation the unity may be hidden by the ostensive multiplicity and a true Polytheism emerge: or if one amongst the many acquire -supremacy, exclusive Monotheism results. The sense of the essential unity of gods expresses itself by the fiction either of relationship or of emanation: the former mode is most natural to the natural man, the latter belongs to a later period of reflection-: the doctrine of the Trinity embodies both modes. Primitive man's conception of his relation to the gods is determined by his selfishness; they may be useful allies or dangerous enemies, there- fore are to be propitiated by prayer and sacrifice. But this egotistic view necessarily transforms itself into a moral one. He needs help chiefly against fellow-men, and as society advances, security against</page><page sequence="4">Critical Notices. 291 them increasingly depends upon their observing certain rules of crude justice. Accordingly, on behalf of these rules he invokes the gods, and by the force of his wishes and by association identifies the rules with the divine will. He thus unwittingly endows the gods with moral attributes, connects their commands not with his own wishes but with the customs of his tribe, so that should he himself infringe those customs he must recognise that the gods are against himself. Where Polytheism has established itself, it may exhibit a subordi- nation of ranks, or all gods may be free and equal. In the latter case, if the subdivision of natural deity has gone so far that every mountain, river, and tree is a god, the perplexed worshipper having no other principle to direct his devotions to an object, pitches upon the nearest. And since the power of these local gods seems less than that of sun and storm, the worshipper's self-interest leads hiim to ascribe to his own river or hill invisible forces to eke out their apparent incapacity to assist and defend him. Such unseen powers rather than the natural object then attract the religious conscious- ness, and Dfemonism or Animism results. Belief in such dasmons is a8sisted by the belief, meanwhile developed from experience of dreams and trances, in the separate existence and immortality of human souls; hence also the worship of deceased ancestors. Fetishism results from the degradation of image-worship, when the worshipper's thoughts dwell on the image itself, oblivious of the god whose image it is. The above abstract of Herr von Hartmann's first hundred pages on Naturalism suggests many difficulties. Neglecting the wild beasts and even the dogs, it is to be observed that the author attaches a very wide and vague meaning to the phrase "natural" or "primitive man". It seems to cover such different periods of culture as might take hundreds of thousands of years to succeed one another. He speaks of "the first form of natural religion, of which all mythologies more or less preserve traces, and which we see most clearly in the VMdas ". But t4-an anthropologist the Vedas are modern compositions. When he says, too, that "the oldest languages are far richer than the modern in synonyms " he must mean "oldest " in a very qualified sense. For such a primitive man, however, great latitude of prevalence in time is needed in order to unite his extraordinary traits of mind and character. At the earliest dawn of religious consciousness, his disinterested c"uriosity about the weather is very enviable, seeing how much more important it must be to his nakedness than to us, not only in this unhappy isle, but even in balmy Berlin.- Still we see that he was not quite unconcerned about it. As far as the author's argu- ment requires him to have been so, he was; but in as far as it requires him not to have been so, he was not. The natural man's Tsthetic impressionability, especially bv the sublime, goes a step beyond it,, and agrees very well with the warmth and phantasmic vigour of imagination which incapacitates him for distinguishing the living from the lifeless, and for which the author with unconscious irony compares him with the modern poet. For this imagination to identify lightning with snakes, and clouds with cows was easy; and a discursive reason</page><page sequence="5">292 Critical Notices. is provided to match. Accounting for belief in an under-world, abode of the dead, von Hartmann says:-" A simple reflexion teaches that if the Heavqns are represented as world-embracing and all-comprehend- ing, they must have another half remote from us ". Explaining the prominence of the sun in mythology, he says :-" The simplest obser- vation teaches that all the light of other objects, even of the sky and stars, is only borrowed sunlight ". Perhaps so; but if these reflections are easy to primitive man, it is the more wonderful that he should get into the muddled state of mind which seems necessary to a sound Henotheist. That a creature of so much insight should not distinguish between one and many must be due to the unconscious teleology by which facts prearranged themselves in anticipation of the above theory. But such, we are to understand, was our ancestor's condition before the use of weapons made him feel his superiority to beasts. The short paragraph in which our author explains the origin of belief in ghosts bears so much resemblance to certain chapters of Mr. Tylor and Mr. Spencer, that he can hardly be unacquainted with the doctrine that religious ideas arose from the worship of deceased ancestors. This view is a formidable rival of his own and similar ones: but he nowhere notices it. Perhaps he will follow up his criticisms of Mr. Darwin with a volume on Wahrheit und Irrthum im Spencerismuw; and when it has appeared we shall wait with interest for the reply. Let us now take the liberty to pass over four or five hundred pages which treat of the modifications of Henotheism amongst the Greeks, Romans, and Germans; its systematisation by the Egyptians and Persians; the Absolute Monism of Brahmins and Buddhists; and at great lengyth of the development of Monotheism amongst the Jews, and the origin of Christianity: in order to arrive the more rapidly at vQn Hartmann's own views of the present condition and prospects of religion. The God of the Semitic race, it appears, at first one with nature, gradually became transcendent; and to supply the immanent divinity thus lost the conception of the Spirit, Sophia, or Logos was introduced. As Logos (preferred for its masculine form to Sophia), it was identified by Christianity with Jesus; and the Son in whom mankind should be saved, thus constituted, was after some hesitation raised to equality with the Father. The difficulty of understanding how so many in- dividuals could be saved in, or by participation in, Him, who Himself was a definite individual person, suggested the doctrine that it was by participation in the Spirit given by Him and the Father. Gradually the Spirit, to avoid materialising it, was personalised, and the Trinity completed. But by thus personalising the Spirit (though the process was never quite carried out), He was so far disqualified for immanence and mediation. The Church therefore began to interpose between the sinner and God the Virgin and Saints; that is, mere persons whose immanence was impossible, vain subterfuges which the Reformation swept away. The orthodox doctrine concerning God is not that one, person ii</page><page sequence="6">Crittical NotieeS. 29t three persons, but that one impersonal God has three persons or aspects; in other words, the Trinity is a Henotheism with three per- soiis. In addressing each person, the worshipper contemplates tho whole Godhead. But since the objective work of redemption belongs to the Son alone, He has such a conspicuous position that we may call Christianity the-religion of the Son as Judaism was of the Father. Christianity makes an advance on Judaism by its elevation, first, of the immanient Spirit to equality with the transcenldent Father; secondly, of the immanence of God in man to the coilception of a divine humanity: thus furnishing at once an active principle and an ideal to the religiously moral life. But the early Christians erred when in their fear of mixing God with Nature they personalised the Spirit and thereby severed God and man. Now at least when such confusion is no longer to be dreaded, to personalise the Spirit is need- less; and freed from the limitations of personality it becomes capable of immanence in men, though still by its infinity and absoluiteness transcendent. Thus just when Tritheistic Henotheism has become intellectually impossible, the Spirit is ready to supersede both tho Father and the Son: the Father, by its identity with Him in respect of substance; the Son, because the Spirit by its immanence takes subjectively the functions of redemption. salvation and reconciliation) and makes an objective historical Saviour superfluous. The Religioni of the Spirit, then, is about to enter upon the scene of consciousness. Whilst former religions laid the burden of the tragedy of the world either upon the Gods, or upon men, or upon the Son of Man, in this the burden falls where in fact it must lie, upon the Uni- versal Spirit, and upon those creatures in whom the Spirit approaches consciousness. Whilst former religions flattered our frailty with hopes of pleasure here or hereafter, that which is to supersede them all will know no such vanity. Whilst in Christianity the principle of religiously-noral life remained on the whole heteronomous, and salva- tion was by another; in the religion of the Spirit the livina principle is truly autonomous, and the power of salvation is immanent in one- self. To this end the Spirit itself has led mankind. The develop- ment of religious conseiousness is nothing but the process by which the Spirit gradually rises to self-consciousness. The religious object may now be described as Concrete Monism: an impersonal Spirit attaining personality in an infinite kingdom of divinised men. It differs from Theism by the impersoiaality of the Spirit; from Brahmanic Abstract Monism by the reality of the many persons in whom it attains consciousness. These other religions were co-ordinate approximations to the religion of the Spirit, which now reconciles and displaces them with the- really last phase of the development of the religious consciousuess. What then is the religious consciousnesss X The book returns no adequate answer. Total disregard of Psychology is one of its chief defects; to which are greatly due both its general vagueness and particular shortcomlings. The bizarre account of the mental qualities of beasts and primitive man has been noticed: a more pervading error</page><page sequence="7">294 Critical Notices. is the assumption that religious changes are the work of understanding and result from the detection of doctrinal contradictions; whereas the chief proximate conditions of such changes are not movements of thought but revolutions of feeling. As long as human feelings in relation to power, liberty, morality are unaltered, intellectual diffi- culties are prolific of apologetic hypotheses, but produce no reforma- tion. Nay, rather than reform religion mankind will embrace systems of philosophy based upon explicit contradictions, and glory in doing so: though in philosophy, if anywhere, intellect should prevail. Con- trolled by feeling, many who have ceased to be theists embrace Pantheism to avoid Positivism: so that von Hartmann need not be surprised though the Omniscient Unconscious upon which his own system depends should not secure its immediate rejection. Another defect which partly explains the insufficience of his Psychology, is the author's superficial information about primitive man and his religions, and merely literary acquaintance with later races and their religions: but the latter need not be dwelt on here, since the Church is defended by many times five hundred ehampions better than the present reviewer, who will of course demolish von Hartmann if they think it worth while. For poverty of facts and direct evidence he seeks to compensate by ingenuity. The praise of great ingenuity cannot be denied him.' His book is a sort of challenge either to accept the theory it sets forth or to produce another equally ingenious. But most of us may fairly decline both alternatives: acceptance, for want of conviction; rivalry, for Prota- goras's reasons, the shortness of life and the obscurity of the subject. Even the ingenuity must not be overrated by Englishmen. Whilst rarely attempted amongst us, to construct a philosophy of religion is a common German exercise. Lectures upon it go on every year in every University of the Empire, and treatises abound, supplying innumerable suggestions both of scheme and detail which render the undertaking much easier than our innocent countrymen are likely to suppose. For whether in Universities or elsewhere little more than the rumour of all this reaches us. Occasionally a popular preacher or writer of dangerous tendencies touches upon it, and astonishes his audience with short swallow-flights of rhetoric that dip their wings in German speculation and skim away. But interest is as transitory; and even amongst the educated anything deserving the name of infor- mation about the subject hardly exists. This is an example of our well-known inaccessibility to ideas and carelessness about applying them to the serious things of life. To our Philistine minds ideas seem important chiefly if true, and true onlv when proved. Hearing of endless speculations with little or no evideuce we neglect them, and go on treating serious things in a serious way.
