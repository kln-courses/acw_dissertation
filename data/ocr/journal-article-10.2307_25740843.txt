<plain_text><page sequence="1">Eckhart's Way. Richard J. Woods. Dublin: Veritas. Pp.223. Price: 15.95. Meister Eckhart, a deeply committed man who loved God in the tumul tuous times when spiritual Europe was reaching its peak, is of specific interest for a variety of reasons. Consider the master's influence in Christian spirituality today. Recall his shaping role during one of the most creative and influential periods in European Christian spirituality, times not unlike our own characterised by an upsurge of eucharistic and visionary piety. Keep in mind the community of discourse and the joint concerns the master shared with many women mystics of his day. Contemplate the depth and value of the mystical and theological themes the master was able to develop in his imaginative use of the German ver nacular. Eckhart believed it better to risk misunderstanding than to be silent on things mystical. Unfortunately he was and is all too easy to misunder stand. Powerful new forms of mystical literacy and speech came to birth with Meister Eckhart and under his influence. There is something sub versive to such novelty. New literacy and new speech inevitably chal lenge older patterns. There is some irony in the fact that Meister Eckhart was accused of heresy, even if that accusation is strongly critiqued today. It is against this vibrant, even paradoxical background that I welcome the new edition of Eckhart scholar Richard Woods's influential book, 583</page><page sequence="2">THE FURROW Eckharfs Way. The book was originally published in the US in 1986, with a British edition quickly following in 1987. A US reprint took place in 1990. Eckharfs Way sits very well indeed with recent Eckhart studies and opens the way for the attentive general reader to enter what can be initially experienced as a world of powerful and intense thought. While Eckharfs Way is more than a basic introduction to an important force in Christian spirituality it is not a treatise requiring extensive previous knowledge of the subject. Therein lies its value to the contemporary seeker in Christian mystical history, practice and thought. Woods divides his well-written and persuasive book into three parts, each with three chapters. Part one, entitled 'Eckharfs Way', offers a reflective introduction to Eckharfs life, times, and his on-going engage ment with women mystics. The second part, entitled 'Eckharfs Spiritual Teaching' takes us to the heart of the master's spirituality: his vision of an ebullient God overflowing in creation; and the interactive movements of soul birth and soul return to God, movements clearly grounded in rad ical selftranscendence. Part three, entitled 'Judgement', opens with a discussion of Meister Eckhart's accusation of heresy and his subsequent trial at Avignon. Nevertheless, despite the negative verdict handed down after Eckharfs death, and the paradox to which it gives rise, and despite the loss of many of his works, the master's teachings continued to be a powerful force in Christian spirituality up to our spiritually hackneyed times. Woods then explores the master's legacy along three lines: his influence on the Rhineland tradition, his relations with women mystics, and the more recent critical rediscovery of Eckhart and efforts to clear his name. The last chapter in part three raises two significant and challenging questions. Was Meister Eckhart a mystic, a man with experimental knowledge of God, or simply a wonderful teacher? Was Meister Eckhart a heretic, or simply a victim of ecclesiastical fears who failed to offer a convincing defence? Such questions explain why Meister Eckhart remains a paradoxical figure for us today, especially in terms of his understanding of the God/self relationship. Thankfully Woods offers a helpful critical overview of both issues. Following a select bibliography the book concludes with two useful appendices, the first offering a com parison of the various English translations of Eckharfs works, and the second listing the sources of the condemned propositions. Eckharfs Way offers a powerful synthesis of thought within a radi cally apophatic vision of spirituality. Woods makes clear Eckhart's chal lenge: to become one with God by ridding the mind of all images and the heart of all attachments. Woods reminds us that Eckhart's way seeks a radical self-transcending detachment so that God may come to birth in the human soul. But what happens when the call to radical self-transcen dence is lost or remains unrecognised and unwelcome in Western reli gious and spiritual circles? The answer is departure and change of allegiance. What happens when prevailing images of God prove juvenile and immature? What happens when prevailing forms of theism remain stolidly anthropomorphic? Today there seem to be only two options for people who have real problems in these related areas: atheism or the East. 584</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS The fact is that the call to radical self-transcendence is the very drive that is leading many of our contemporaries out of the Church and into Zen, Vedanta, or some other alternative form of apophatic mysticism. In just such circumstances Woods offers a timely reminder that radical self transcendence forms the deep heart of Eckhart's way. Beyond radical self-transcendence and the equally radical detachment it demands, the master asks for no special practices, no pilgrimages to be undertaken, no prescribed penances. What is at stake is a life 'without why', a life at last unmoved by self-love or any material principle. The master offers what Woods has elsewhere called a way less way, and we desperately need to rediscover something of it in the contempo rary Irish Church. A taste of this way less way is found in Eckhart's iden tification of two realities I suggest are fundamental to the renewal of contemporary Irish spirituality: the paradoxes that highlight the inherent limitations of the human mind, and the boundaries of the unknown, rad ically different territory, the void or the abyss, where God dwells. Reflect on these two realities and see whether they take you to the transforma tive potentials of the divine desert or to the wasteland of the unreformed mind. As I conclude this review I draw attention to the contemporary ecu menical and inter-faith implications of Eckhart's influence. It has reached beyond the Catholic tradition into the Lutheran, Anabaptist and Pietist movements on the one hand, and into both Hindu and Buddhist circles on the other. The implications for interspirituality are intriguing and challenging. Do I recommend the book? Wholeheartedly! Take and read. Milltown Park, Dublin Jack Finnegan</page></plain_text>
