STYLE GUIDE FOR AUTHORS This "Style Guide for Authors" covers the format and language to use when preparing manuscripts for the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ). A different document, "Information for Contributors" (in the front of each issue and at http://www.aom. pace.edu/amj/submission.html), describes desir able content. Look for the AMJ "Style Guide for Authors" on the Web, at http://aom.pace.edu/amjnew/style_guide. html and in issues of AMJ, where it appears when space permits. Manuscript Submission and Length Submit manuscripts electronically to the editor at amjtlee@u.washington.edu, following the "In structions for Electronic Submission" at http:// aom.pace.edu/amj7electronic.html. Full articles should not ordinarily exceed 40 pages of double-spaced, 12-point type. Research notes should not ordinarily exceed 25 pages. Please use the 8V2 X 11 page setting; place page numbers in the upper right corner; and leave top and side margins of at least one inch. Publication Process AMJ is not printed directly from authors' files. Accepted manuscripts are copy-edited and re typed. Authors review edits and proofread their work before it is published. AMfs copy editor production manager will contact you to arrange this process after the editor's office assigns your work to an issue. Expect some time lag between acceptance and publication. If your work is accepted, please keep the editor's office (amjtlee@u.washington.edu) and the copy editor (pdoliner@twcny.rr.com) informed of job changes and long absences so that they can contact you. Front Pages Address. Under the title of your work, list au thors' names, affiliations, and complete addresses and contact numbers. Example: AN EXCELLENT STUDY A. A. MANAGEMENT SCHOLAR Current University School and/or Department Building and/or Street City, State, Zip Code Tel: (000) 000-0000 Fax: (000) 000-0000 e-mail: scholar@fam.edu Acknowledgment. If you wish to acknowledge financial support or other assistance, add a note at the bottom of page 1, your title page. Abstract. An abstract of about 75 words and the title of the work go on page 2. Back Pages Group any references, appendixes, tables, and figures at the end of your manuscript. Continue your page numbering. Headings and Sections AM/uses only three levels of headings. These form a hierarchy, with main headings (all capital letters; centered) first, then second-level headings (title style?upper- and lower-case?letters; flush left), and then third-level headings (first letter of first word capitalized; indented; italicized; and run into para graph) next. Use boldface for all the headings. Don't skip steps and, say, head a section with a second-level heading before you have used a first level heading. Use second- and third-level head ings in sets. Don't break out just one second-level subsection within a main section or just one third level subsection within a second-level subsection. Examples: METHODS Data and Sample Measures Independent variable. Dependent variables. Hypotheses Fully and separately state each hypothesis you tested separately. Give it a distinct number (Hy pothesis 1) or number-letter (Hypothesis la) label. Set hypotheses off in indented blocks, in italic type. Examples: Hypothesis la. Concise writing has a positive relationship to publication. 153</page><page sequence="2">154 Academy of Management Journal February Hypothesis lb. Following AMJ's "Style Guide for Authors" has a positive relationship to publication. Language Technical terms. Help your work to be accessible to AMJ's wide-ranging readership. Define key techni cal terms. A technical term is a word or phrase that is not in a general-use dictionary with the meaning you (or even you and other published scholars) ascribe to it. Putting the first appearance of a word in quotation marks can replace providing a definition for technical terms that are not key to your work. Example: We noted several instances of "voluntary turnover," but these were outside the focus of this study. Abbreviations. Avoid using abbreviations for the names of concepts. Use ordinary words for variable names?not code names or other abbreviations. Use the same name for a variable throughout your text, tables, figures, and appendixes. Names of organizations and research instruments may be abbreviated, but give the full name the first time you mention one of these. Names of software and some databases may be abbreviated. Reporting math. Do not "talk in math" in regular text. Use words. For instance, "We surveyed 100 employees," not "We surveyed n = 100 employees" and "We used a chi-square test to evaluate fit," not "We used a x2 test." Do use mathematical symbols and numbers to report illustrative results and give formulas. In both, italicize letters that are customarily italicized, such as p, r, b, F, and Z. Use boldface italic for vectors. Put spaces around equals signs. Illustrative results go in parentheses. The text introducing them should be a complete sentence. Example: One coefficient for the interaction was significant (model 3: ? = 0.06, p &lt; .05; model 5: ? = 1.06). Equations' presentation depends on their appear ance and their role in your research. Generally, formulas that aren't key and equations used to es timate regression coefficients should be run into the text. However, formulas that contain oversized symbols or division cannot be run in. These, and some one-line equations, should be displayed (centered). If you assign a number to a displayed equation, place it in parentheses, on the far right. Examples: Run-in equation?We used Craig's (1992: 20) dis tance formula (d = xyz). Displayed equation? [e-x?xt)k(Xtyi Pi(Yt = ytxt) =-ftT~' (1) where Yt is. . . . Your definition of each new term in the equation follows. Sexist or biased language. Avoid language that might be interpreted as denigrating to ethnic or other groups. Be particularly careful in dealing with gender, where long-established customs, such as the use of "he" as a generic pronoun ("a manager ... he"), can imply gender-based discrimination. Using plural pronouns?changing "the manager . . . he" to "managers . . . they"? usually helps. Active voice and first person. Put sentences in the active voice ("I did it"; "They did it") instead of the passive voice ("It was done") to make it easy for readers to see who did what. Use the first person ("I" or "we") to describe what you, or you and your coauthors, did. Examples: Passive (less desirable)?Two items were found to lack factor validity by Earley (1989). Active (more desirable)?Earley (1989) found that two items lacked factor validity. Third person (less desirable)?The author devel oped three new items. First person (more desirable)?I developed three new items. Anthropomorphism. Avoid describing inani mate entities (models, theories, firms, and so forth) as acting in ways only humans can act. Appendixes Present long but essential methodological de tails, such as explanations of the calculation of measures, in an appendix or appendixes. Presenta tion should be concise. If you can, avoid table formats and exact repro ductions of surveys. Lists with headings are fine. Look at published AMJs for models. Label multiple appendixes "APPENDIX A," "AP PENDIX B," and so forth. A substantive title, such as "Items in Scales," should follow. Label tables within appendixes "Table Al," "Bl," and so forth. Tables and Figures Useful tables and figures do not duplicate the text or each other. Please carefully consider what each table or figure adds to your work. Look at tables and figures in published issues of AMJ to get ideas for preferred formats. For each table or figure, center "TABLE" or "FIG</page><page sequence="3">2004 Volume 47, Number 1 155 URE" with a number ("1," "2," etc.) at the top of the page. Put the title under this, also centered and in boldface type, but in title-style letters (upper and lower case). Number tables and figures consecutively (one se ries for tables, one for figures). Place tables and figures at the end of the manuscript, but indicate the position of each in the text as follows: Insert Table 2 about here Each table or figure must have a sentence in your text that introduces it. More on tables. Use more than one page if needed to achieve a neat, readable presentation. Please do not squeeze material onto one page by shrinking type or using abbreviations. Spell out the names of your variables. Don't use code names and abbreviations. Example: Desirable variable name?Profitability Undesirable variable name?PRFT Each table should report one type of analysis (which is identified in the title), and each vertical column and horizontal row should contain only one type of data. Label the data across the top or down the far-left side?not in the body. The body of your table should contain only data. In general, give ages and percentages as whole numbers, and report only two decimal places for all statistics. Place correlation coefficients in the lower-left corners of their tables. For general footnotes to tables, use superscript small letters. A lettered footnote may be used to summarize significance levels: a All values greater than . . . are significant at. . . . To report significance levels one-by-one, indent separate footnotes under all your other footnotes. Use asterisks. Example: *p &lt; .05 **p &lt; .01 Unless you are reporting exact probabilities, keep to two levels of significance. In all cases, use a single asterisk for the .05 level. More on figures. Figures (unlike tables) have graphics. If possible, our printer scans figures di rectly from the hard copy of your manuscript into the publication files. So make sure your figures will print out clearly. Place all words horizontally?avoid setting words parallel to your y-axis in a graph, and avoid vertical stacks of letters. Use the same full (not abbreviated) variable names you use in the text and tables. Citations Formal citations. These are your in-text, in pa rentheses, identifications of other research. Every work that has a citation needs to have a correspond ing reference (see "References," below). Examples: Name and year?Several studies (Adams, 1994; Bernstein, 1988, 1992; Celias, 2000a, 2000b) sup port this conclusion. Year only?But Van Dorn and Xavier (2001) pre sented conflicting evidence. Order. Order citations alphabetically. Designate two or more works by one author (or by an identical group of authors) published in the same year by adding "a," "b," and so forth, after the year. See the "name and year" example just given. Multiple authors. If a work has two authors, give both names every time you cite it. For three through six authors, give all names the first time, then use "et al." in citations. Examples: First citation?Few field studies use random assign ment (Foster, Whittington, Tucker, Homer, Hub bard, &amp; Grimm, 2000). Subsequent citations?. . . even when random as signment is not possible (Foster et al., 2000). For seven or more authors, use "et al." even for the first citation. (But the corresponding reference should give all the names.) Page numbers. To cite a direct quotation in run ning text, give its page after the year, separated from it by a space and a colon. Example: In-text quotation?Lee has said that writing a book is "a long and arduous task" (1998: 3). No author? For an article with no author, cite the periodical as author. Example: Periodical as author?Analysts predicted an in crease in service jobs {Wall Street Journal, 1999). For reports, handbooks, and the like, cite the "cor porate author" that produced them. Example: Organization as author?Analysts predict an in crease in service jobs in the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992).</page><page sequence="4">156 Academy of Management Journal February Such sources can also be identified informally. No corresponding reference will then be needed. Example: Informal citation?According to the 1999 U.S. In dustrial Outlook, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, service jobs will increase. Electronic sources. Use a regular citation (author, year) if you can identify an author of one of the types discussed above (human, periodical, or cor porate). If not, give the Web address that was your source in parentheses. No corresponding reference need be used in the latter case. References References are your entries in the alphabetical list at the end of your article or research note. This list should include only work you have cited. Order. Alphabetize references by the last name of a sole author, a first author, or an editor, or by the name of a corporate author (for instance, U.S. Cen sus Bureau) or periodical (such as the Wall Street Journal) if there is no human author or editor. Or der works by an identical author by year of publi cation, listing the earliest first. If the years of pub lication are also the same, differentiate entries by adding small letters ("a," "b," etc.) after the years. Repeat the author's name for each entry. Books. Follow this form: Last names, initials (separated by a space). Year. Title (Boldface italic, capitalize only the first letter of the first word and of the first word after a long dash or colon.) City where published: Name of publisher. (For small U.S. and Canadian cities, follow the name of the city with the postal abbreviation for the state or province; for small cities in other countries, give the full name of the country.)

ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT PUBLICATIONS MISSION STATEMENT The Academy of Management is committed to advancing theory, research, edu cation, and practice in the field of management. The Academy publishes four journals, each of which broadly contributes to this objective while emphasizing a particular scholarly aspect of it. The Academy of Management Review (AMR) provides a forum to explicate theoretical insights and developments. Articles published in the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) empirically examine theory-based knowledge. The Academy of Management Learning and Education (AMLE) provides a forum to examine learning processes and management educa tion. Articles published in the Academy of Management Executive (AME) use research-based knowledge to inform and improve management practice. Addi tional details about each journal's scholarly domain are included in the respective mission statements. ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL MISSION STATEMENT The mission of the Academy of Management Journal (AMJ) is to publish empirical research that tests knowledge-based claims. All empirical methods, including, but not limited to, qualitative, quantitative, field, laboratory, and combination meth ods, are welcome. Articles published in AMJ must make strong empirical and theoretical contributions and highlight the significance of those contributions to the management field. Thus, preference is given to submissions that provide a strong theoretical framework as the foundation to empirically examine issues with high relevance for management theory and management practice.</page><page sequence="6">Academy of Management Journal SPECIAL RESEARCH FORUM CALL FOR PAPERS: MANAGING EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION Anil K. Gupta, University of Maryland Ken G. Smith, University of Maryland Christina E. Shalley, Georgia Institute of Technology Overview It is generally accepted that continued long term development and performance, whether it be at the individual, group or organizational level, requires the effective management of two interrelated processes: exploration or the search for new opportunities and the accumulation of new knowledge and routines, and exploitation or the appropriation of value from existing opportunities, knowledge, and routines. Exploration without exploitation implies upfront investments in learning without the prospect of corresponding returns and, thus, may not be valuable or rewarding over a continued period of time. On the other hand, exploitation without exploration may result in declining value over time because of the erosion of existing knowledge and skills through competitive processes and changing environmental conditions. What is less clear is how these processes should be managed and balanced. This special forum is an effort to identify the relationship between exploration and exploitation and to explore how these processes should be managed and balanced across different levels of analysis. The terms "exploration and exploitation" invoke different images for micro and macro researchers, yet they are very meaningful for both. Therefore, we seek a range of articles that span these areas and contribute across levels of analysis. Despite the obvious symbiosis between exploration and exploitation, research on these issues has tended to study these two processes in isolation rather than jointly. For example, the literature on competitive advantages has emphasized sustaining existing advantages at the expense of creating new advantages. Much of the literature on creativity has emphasized the process of learning, search, and discovery without attention to appropriation. As a consequence, there is a need to improve our understanding of how individuals, groups, and firms manage, balance and give attention to these processes over time. There is also a need to identify how both individual factors (personality, experience, knowledge, skills, ability) and contextual factors (components of the job, supervisory demands/support, group or organizational climate, organizational size, technology, struc ture and environments) influence how these processes are managed and controlled. Finally, there is a need to improve our understanding of the consequences of alternative strategies for the management of exploration and exploitation at all levels of analysis. We expect scholars from a broad range of disciplines to submit to this special research forum. For example, we encourage scholars with an interest in creativity, innovation, and learning to join forces with scholars from organizational behavior, human resource management, and strategic management to achieve an integrated advance. In addition, we also seek papers from meso researchers on this subject. For example, micro research ers might work with macro scholars to connect individual processes of creativity and learning, with organi zational processes through which organizations also seek to exploit such outcomes, resulting in, for example, innovations. Furthermore, we imagine that the management of these processes will be different across alternative cultures; thus the topic should be of interest to a global audience. Research Questions We invite empirical contributions that examine the interplay between exploration and exploitation in any of a variety of possible contexts. Special topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: How similar or different are the requirements for succeeding at exploration vs. exploitation? How might these processes differ across different units of analysis (individuals, groups, organizations)? Can the same individual, team, or organization do both tasks effectively? If so, must these processes be managed concurrently, or sequentially? Does it depend on what stage of the process, firm, or industry we are involved in? Specifically, are there different stages in the evolution of different jobs, projects, organiza tions, or industries when one may be more desirable than another? How does an individual's, group's, or firm's prior history with exploration and exploitation determine the extent of inertia in moving from exploitation to exploration or vice versa? Is the inertia or freedom of movement between exploration and exploitation contingent on other endogenous and/or exogenous 158</page><page sequence="7">factors? What are the political implications of exploitation, particularly when it is done by those not involved in the actual exploration and vice versa? What is the role of risk? How do individuals, groups, and organizations balance taking risks and dealing with failure in order to learn and to be more creative? What processes have to be in place to support exploration versus exploitation? When is exploration desirable and when does it lead to diminishing returns? When is it more advantageous to capitalize on existing resources and build effective routines rather than to search out new ways of doing things? Are there parallel processes between levels of analysis in the manner by which individuals, groups or organizations explore and exploit that could shed light and inform how these processes should be managed across levels of analysis? Does/must there exist "multiple skills" or a "division of labor" in the execution of exploration vs. exploitation tasks? If so, in what order and at what level (individual/team/department/business unit/ industry) might/should such specialization occur, and how should the two processes be coordinated? How does the rate of learning and innovation among other workers or the level of the technological innovation and competition in an industry affect the manner by which individuals/organizations cycle between exploitation and exploration? How do individuals, groups, or firms manage the transition in emphasis from exploration to exploitation and vice versa as they evolve over time? What are the triggers and contingencies that drive this transition process, and how might this transition process vary? At different stages of the creative or innovative process, are different types of people or skills required to be able to successfully explore or exploit? How can managers learn to recognize good ideas to exploit them? What happens when others choose to exploit the ideas of an individual or team? How do politics come into play in groups and firms in terms of when to share exploratory ideas and when they may be exploited by others? How do the corporate governance requirements for exploration and exploitation differ across levels of analysis and alternative types of organizational structures, organizations, environments, and cultures? How do the processes for knowledge accumulation by individuals, groups, and firms differ from and interact with those for knowledge diffusion? For example, how do the processes for knowledge acquisition differ from and interact with the processes of knowledge exploitation? What are the similarities, differences, and interactions between an individual's group's, or organization's "creative capacity," "diffusive capacity," "absorptive capacity," and "risk-taking capacity"? What are the consequences of being successful at exploration (or exploitation) but not exploitation (or exploration), and of being successful at both (or neither)? What are the contingencies that jointly impact the success of exploration and exploitation at different levels of analysis? Deadlines and Submission Instructions All submissions must adhere to the format and style guidelines for the Academy of Management Journal (http://aom.pace.edu/amjnew/style_guide.html).

LEADERSHIP IN ORGANIZATIONS Current Issues and Key Trends Edited by John Storey "Thoughtful managers and academics frustrated by the confusion surrounding the concept of leadership and how to develop it, should read this book. Storey and his associates have done an excellent job of dis pelling the leadership myth that has emerged in the last two decades and laid bare false claims about how to develop it. They have replaced myths with a more complex organizationally and contextually embedded view of leadership and how to develop it/' ?MICHAEL BEER, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL &amp; CHAIRMAN, CENTER FOR ORGANIZATIONAL FITNESS $36.95 INTERNATIONAL HRM 2ND EDITION Dennis Briscoe and Randall Sch?ler This exciting and revised text provides a com prehensive overview of the field of International Human Resource Management os practiced in multinational enterprises and by IHRM practi tioners.
