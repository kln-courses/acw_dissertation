Mythologies relate many stories about the jealousy of the gods. It is a re- current theme of world literature in every century. To find this often unlovely quality made a divine attribute in the Bible startles and sometimes shocks. This</page><page sequence="2">1964] Book Reviews 499 bold anthropopathic term, despite its pejorative associations, is used constantly to denote the divine assertion of an exclusive right. In the language of analogy it is an affirmation of Yahweh's sovereignty and a vindication of His covenantal claims on His people. What did the sacred authors mean by divine qine'ah ? What are its theological implications ? This book contains R.'s answer to these two questions. "A simple study of vocabulary, this work belongs to biblical theology, because this word reflects a whole conception of salvation and the covenant" (p. 8). The method adopted is simple: a detailed exegesis of every passage where qine'ah occurs in the canonical books and of the equivalent terms where found in the deutero- canonical books ( zelos and its derivatives). This is a literary study which is conducted along historical lines and discloses the semantic evolution and theo- logical significance of a word intimately connected with the idea of the God who redeems and saves. Qine'ah (to become crimson, i.e., with emotion) and its usual LXX equivalent zelos denote a vehemence of feeling which may be directed against someone (anger, wrath, indignation), or exercised in favor of someone (enthusiasm, eagerness, intense ardor). In the oldest Israelite traditions, jealousy is used to express God's anger at transgressions of the covenant and His insistence on obedience to His command- ments. The Deuteronomist preserves all the powerful intensity of the word but fuses with it at the same white heat, an understanding of a beneficent and loving God. Therefore, during the exile, it is not surprising to find that qine'ah has become the wrath of offended love. Paralleling but distinct from this devel- opment, especially in Ez, it becomes a conjugal symbol and may express the violence of the betrayed spoiise or the tenderness of his merciful love. After the exile both aspects are exploited. The second Isaiah and some of the late verses of Na and So record that God's burning ardor is directed against pagan nations. At this time it is first used as an eschatological term. Other postexilic authors (notably J1 and Za) select it to express the beauty of Yahweh's all- encompassing love. Curiously the word is never found in the last books of the OT - R. suggests that in the wider horizons and broader thought categories of later authors it is replaced by agape. He quotes C. Wiéner: ". . . God's love manifested itself less as the ardent (and jealous) passion of the spouse for the one loved but rather as the favor God grants those who are eager to do his will." Thus R. concludes that divine qine' ah is situated at the intersection of God's holiness, anger and love. It is a manifestation in the historical situation of the selective and purifying exigencies of divine holiness, the inexorable and uncompromising demands of divine anger and the insatiable and all-consuming claims of divine love. It is a consequence of the covenant bond linking Yahweh and His people. This unique relation is too personal to be called zeal, too vast to be called conjugal love, too tender to be called violence. Yet, paradoxically, this difficult- to-define term embraces all these values. Towards the close of his study (p. 148), R. gives this definition of qine'ah : "It is the violent reaction of the holiness of divine love, revealed in the setting of the covenant, against all that diminishes Yahweh's relation with his people."</page><page sequence="3">500 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 26 Zeal and jealousy are the terms usually offered as the English equivalents of qine'ah . Both are derived from the same Greek word (žēlos) . Both are intensely personal. R. prefers the second because it springs from a deeply committed love and better expresses the living, concrete, personal relationship of Yahweh and His people. This love acts as a purifying fire, accepting in those who are loved no deviation or defect, creating in them the sanctity of the One who loves. This is a careful study. The positions adopted are sometimes arbitrary but the documentation is thorough. The most detailed pages are those devoted to the ' analysis of the texts (pp. 1-135). The 14 pages explaining the theological sig- nificance of the term are disappointing and could well be expanded. Indices should have been provided. This book provides a sound and solid corrective for an uninformed and indif- ferent tolerance so vaunted today. Jealousy is no primitive anthropomorphism to be discarded by the more philosophically sophisticated. It is a dynamic divine attribute demanding the total commitment to God which is man's perennial duty and privilege. Mother Kathryn Sullivan, R.S.C.J.</page></plain_text>
