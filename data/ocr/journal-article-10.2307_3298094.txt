<plain_text><page sequence="1">SATIRIC MEMORIES: AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF GENRE At the opening of his first Satire, Juvenal inveighs against the multitude of hack poets in Rome, and concludes that he might as well make his own literary contribution. The satirist declares that like every other writer around, he was educated in rhetoric (Satire 1.15-18): et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus, et nos consilium dedimus Sullae, privatus ut altum dormiret. stulta est clementia, cum tot ubique vatibus occurras, periturae parcere chartae. This brief autobiographical comment strikes readers as a telling gesture to the rhetorical elements that characterize Juvenal's work. Specifically, the poet's claim in 15-17 that he learned declamation (here represented by a typical suasoria) functions not as an historical reference' but as a prompt for the reader to be aware of declamatory conventions-especially the all-important persona or mask-when reading Juvenal's tirades. Rather than telling us something about the real Juvenal, the passage prepares us to recognize the poems that follow as carefully crafted rhetorical tours deforce. But the declamatory background of Juvenalian satire is only one context in which we may interpret this reference to education. It is possible to appreciate more fully the programmatic dimension of Juvenal's poetic autobiography when we acknowledge that it has precedent in the Roman satiric tradition. This essay will situate the above vignette in just this context. Like Juvenal, Horace and Persius present us with reminiscences about their youth and schooling; these passages have been much examined in relation to their individual poetry collections, but not in the context of the satiric tradition. Although these three satiric passages treat a single ' The ancient Lives seem to have inferred from these lines that Juvenal declaimed until middle age; even Highet (1954) 96 deems this inference a dubious one. 2 On declamatory elements in Juvenal see de Decker (1913), Kenney (1963), Anderson (1982) 297-98 and 414-80, and Braund (1997; see 148 on the set speeches mentioned in the passages surveyed here). The persona is key in the last two studies and in modern scholarship on satire in general. For the original and influential studies of this device, see Mack (1951) and Kernan (1959 [1976]); Anderson (1982) and Braund (1988) apply the concept to the Roman genre in close readings.

I will demonstrate that the "educational autobiography" expresses characteristics of the satiric genre and particularly of the satirist figure that the tradition constructs. The fabricated autobiographies of the satiric poet should not be discounted because of their historical invalidity, for they participate in the construction of the satirist figure, expanding it from a mere "mask" into a character with a history and experiences.3 This character is a generic marker. The topic of the satirists' education will likely strike readers as being linked to the function of teaching that is traditionally attributed to satire. This essay acknowledges the significance of this element of satire-or more precisely, of the influence that the expectation of a didactic program has on the practice and criticism of satire. But here I aim to interpret the poets' educational reminiscences more symbolically than literally. I will read the mention of education not simply as an expression of moral or philosophical qualifications, but as a signifier for the poets' qualifications to write satire-a project whose generic rules extend beyond a didactic program. The problems, reversals, and dark sides of the scenes which I will examine below direct us to consider this entire set of rules rather than to measure the poets' performance as educators. The young versions of themselves that the Roman satirists construct are, primarily and by definition, satirists-to-be, not candid asides or incidental snapshots of typical Roman schoolboys. Their origin and generic context make their identities. The educational autobiography functions both as a genre-wide convention and as a device for the expression of each satirist's particular method. All three poets compose such reminiscences, and even the briefest autobiography, Juvenal's, still centers on the topic of education; this last abbreviated version suggests that the topic is especially significant to the tradition. In addition, in the context of each individual author, the passages have special thematic importance. The self-portraits that the satirists offer in their autobiographies resonate with, and are enriched by, other images of ' I want to make clear at the outset that when I use the name of a particular satirist, I am referring to the speaker or the character evoked in that speaker's self- portrait, not the historical author. I use the poets' names both because it is less cumbersome, and because I want to stress that in reading satire we must to an extent play along with the fiction that the speaker is a real person. It is useful to quote Oliensis (1998) 2: "Horace is present in his personae...not because these personae are authentic and accurate impressions of his true self, but because they effectively construct that self." Moreover, Oliensis' recognition of the "fusion of mask and self" in the same discussion encourages us to view the satirist's body as part of his character as well.</page><page sequence="3">SATIRIC MEMORIES 217 the satirist figure in their poetry. Horace's reminiscence emphasizes his vulnerability both to outside threats and to petty vices, a condition that his version of the satirist figure experiences throughout the Sermones. Persius borrows Horace's ethical vulnerability for his own reminiscence, but further explores the potential of the student figure as a transgressive and yet high- minded character-a perfect model for the Persian satirist. Juvenal's brief vignette boils these qualities back down into the picture of a vulnerable figure in the midst of a landscape of violence and harassment. The poets retroactively construct past selves whose experiences mirror those of the adult satirist figure. Horace's poetry, from the Sermones to the Epistles, contains much in the way of personal reminiscence. Within this category there are a number of references to the poet's education. Sermones 1.4 includes the beloved portrait of Horace's father, the old-fashioned moralizer who taught his son to improve himself by observing others' faults (105-39). At Sermones 1.6.71-87 the poet recalls his school days at Rome, surrounded by more well-off peers. At Epistles 2.2.41-45 he gives a thumbnail sketch of his education in literature at Rome, and in philosophy at Athens. As Anderson has observed, education is a governing theme of Horace's autobiographical program.4 The passage from Sermones 1.4 is especially instrumental in establishing the character of Horace as satirist. This well-known poetic autobiography, whose primary subject is the teaching of morality, is intricately linked to the generic identity and program of Horatian satire. The poem itself begins with a gesture to the Old Comic poets and Lucilius as originators of the satiric tradition, but ends with a tribute to Horace's father and his gentler method. Leach demonstrated thirty years ago in a seminal article that the elder Horace is modeled on the New Comic pater and thus emblematizes the influence of that genre on Horatian sermo.5 Freudenburg, noting that "the fictional nature of [the scene] need not rule out the possibility of its programmatic intent," suggests that Horace uses these comic conventions not just to allude to his generic influences, but to mock his own role as self-appointed teacher of morality.6 Most recently, Schlegel has reconsidered the figure of Horace senior in the poem, elevating him from a basic comic convention to an active participant in a literary succession that emphasizes the real- world Roman value of pietas.7 This last reading shows most effectively how autobiographical commentary in satire may be read fruitfully in its thematic and social context. 4 Anderson (1982) 72. -Leach (1971). 6 Freudenburg (1993) 34-39. 7 Schlegel (2000) 94-107.</page><page sequence="4">218 CATHERINE KEANE These conclusions on the significance of 1.4 provide a model for examining its counterpart in 1.6, at least in terms of recognizing autobiographical fiction as a generic marker. Schlegel views the passages as parallel in that both show Horace senior competing with an alternate father figure; in 1.4 it is Lucilius, in 1.6 the patron Maecenas." But the reminiscence in 1.6, though framed as a tribute to the poet's father, also highlights Horace himself in a most striking way. This passage resembles Juvenal's poetic autobiography more closely than does its counterpart in 1.4, first in that it alludes to Horace's formal schooling as opposed to his lifelong moral training, and second in that here Horace is more visible as a character and particularly as a body. This latter feature encourages the kind of expanded view of the satiric persona that I mention above. In addition to providing a counterpart to the picture of Horace senior in 1.4, the account of the young Horace's schooling introduces the satiric body into the educational autobiography. In the process of explaining his good personal qualities to Maecenas, Horace recalls the formal education he received as a child. Horace's schooling, the account implies, made all the difference for his future social position (Sermones 1.6.71-89): causa fuit pater his, qui macro pauper agello noluit in Flavi ludum me mittere, magni quo pueri magnis e centurionibus orti, laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto, ibant octonos referentes Idibus aeris, sed puerum est ausus Romam portare, docendum artis quas doceat quivis eques atque senator semet prognatos. vestem servosque sequentis, in magno ut populo, si qui vidisset, avita ex re praeberi sumptus mihi crederet illos. ipse mihi custos incorruptissimus omnes circum doctores aderat. quid multa? pudicum, qui primus virtutis honos, servavit ab omni non solum facto, verum opprobrio quoque turpi; nec timuit, sibi ne vitio quis verteret, olim si praeco parvas aut, ut fuit ipse, coactor mercedes sequerer: neque ego essem questus: at hoc nunc laus illi debetur et a me gratia maior. nil me paeniteat sanum patris huius... The details of Horace's recollection are vivid; the way that the poet idealizes his father and hints at his boyhood anxieties has touched many readers. 9 Particularly striking are Horace's apparent fears of the big boys at Flavius' school (magni / ...pueri magnis e 8 Schlegel (2000) 108-116. 9 For two such reactions, see Fraenkel (1957) 3 and Rudd (1966) 43.</page><page sequence="5">SATIRIC MEMORIES 219 centurionibus orti / laevo suspensi loculos tabulamque lacerto, 72-7410) and the elder Horace's concern for his son's purity once in the city (pudicum / qui primus virtutis honos, servavit ab omni / non solum facto, verum opprobrio quoque turpi, 82-84). Vocabulary evoking fear and shame also permeates the scene: puerum est ausus Romam portare, 76; ipse mihi custos...aderat, 81-82; [me] servavit, 83; nec timuit, 85; nil me paeniteat, 89). Despite the vividness of Horace's account, however, this passage is certainly not unmediated reminiscence, but a deliberately composed "memory." Anderson, Oliensis, and Schlegel have paved the way to this conclusion, and my own reading will highlight the generic associations of the character created in the passage. Horace has constructed a young satirist figure. The picture of the young Horace is fraught with anxiety about being harmed-physically (suggested in 73-74), sexually (82-84),11 and verbally (84).1 This recalls images of the body of the adult satirist in the Sermones. We are told at various points that this body is also vulnerable, though more comically so. On his journey to Brindisium in Satire 1.5, the poet suffers from stomach and eye ailments (7-8 and 49) and famously stains himself in a wet dream (84-85).13 In other misadventures, Horace apparently runs the risk of being caught and punished for adultery; so the disapproving slave Davus claims at 2.7.46-67. He represents himself as an occasional scruffy dresser and clumsy dinner guest at 1.3.29-32 and 90-94.14 In these comments Horace creates a picture of himself as a comic character who suffers medical ailments and physical threats, and is generally disheveled-looking. We can also note that the Priapus statue who narrates 1.8, Horace's consummate alter ego, is vulnerable to vandals; this character risks being defiled with urine and excrement (37-38), and when invading witches get too close, disfigures himself in a defensive move (46-47).15 10 The noun lacertus often suggests brawn or is used by association to mean strength; e.g. Statius Theb. 6.78, Silius Italicus Pun. 1.262, Vergil Aen. 11.561, Horace Epist. 2.2.48, and Juvenal 10.11. " Rudd (1966) 43 interprets 82-84 as referring to possible corruption by teachers in particular, which would stress the young Horace's passive position and vulner- ability. 12 Fraenkel (1957) 3 also imagines verbal abuse from the boys at Flavius' school. 13 Richlin (1992) 26-30 recognizes staining, including with semen, as a method of punishment that is often enacted in satire, though she does not comment on Horace's double role as stainer and victim in this scene. Contrast Oliensis (1998) 28, who notes that the wet dream is one of many instances where the poem substitues comic violence for real violence. But while Oliensis emphasizes the comedy of Horace's mishaps (and hence his self-effacement against the background of civil war), I want to stress simply that they occur, and leave us with an impression of his body as vulnerable. 14 On the equation of these hypothetical characters with Horace, see Armstrong (1989) 37-41 and Freudenburg (1993) 27-30. "5 Richlin (1992) offers the model of Roman satiric author as Priapus figure; see</page><page sequence="6">220 CATHERINE KEANE Related to these images are suggestions elsewhere that Horace qua satirist is vulnerable to the hatred and threats of others, a kind of metaphorical violence. While detractors depict satire itself as an act of aggression against notorious individuals and even readers, the satirist figure responds by representing himself in a defensive posture. At 1.4.33 Horace claims that "all [reprobates] fear verses, and hate poets" (omnes hi metuunt versus, odere poetas). In his consultation with the lawyer Trebatius, he compares satire to a range of self-defensive tools found throughout society and nature, including judges' urns, witches' potions, wolves' fangs, and bulls' horns (47-48, 51), and most memorably, a sheathed sword: hic stilus haud petet ultro / quemquam animantem, et me veluti custodiet ensis / vagina tectus (39-41). Another case of metaphorical attack is Horace's complaint that envious social climbers "gnaw" at him ([me] quem rodunt omnes, 1.6.46). The above cases, representing a spectrum of discomforts and assaults, real and metaphorical violence, experiences of Horace or an alter ego, help to construct an environment in which the satirist figure is constantly, and usually comically, threatened with harm or disfigurement. Horace's vulnerability as a boy, narrated retro- spectively and on the surface more seriously, completes this picture. It is only the beginning of his career as endangered satirist, and functions programmatically just as the above references do. The body that Horace creates, and not simply the celebrated "mask" or "face," is the true spokesman for the satiric genre. As a postscript to this survey of Horace's attributes as a satirist, it is worth looking at ways that the poet parodies aspects of his early education elsewhere in the Sermones. Self-parody on the part of the speaker is a definitive feature of satire, and inconsistent or outrageous claims have long been used as evidence of the poets' distance from, and mockery of, the personae they create.16 In the case of Horace, who so frequently makes himself a visible character in the Sermones, self-parody is manifested in hints of his personal faults. Sermones Book 2 is especially instrumental in this, as it stages diatribes that parody those of Book 1 (e.g. 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.7), some explicitly featuring Horace as target and audience (2.3 and 2.7). This program of self-criticism is elucidated especially well by Oliensis, who calls the speaker of Book 2 "the self-incriminating satirist."17 The education scene of 1.6 plays into these criticisms in two identifiable ways. First, Horace notes that his father dressed and especially 57-63. For a reading that emphasizes the self-mutilation (via a frighteningly loud fart) of the Horatian Priapus, see Hallett (1981). 16 E.g. Freudenburg (1993) 21-33 on Horace; cf. Braund (1996) 120 on Juvenal's inconsistency in Satire 1. 17 Oliensis (1998) 41-63.</page><page sequence="7">SATIRIC MEMORIES 221 equipped him extravagantly in Rome, presumably so that he would blend in with his peers (vestem servosque sequentis / in magno ut populo, si qui vidisset, avita / ex re praeberi sumptus mihi crederet illos, 78-80). The picture of a pretentiously attired Horace, rather charming in this case when he is so vulnerable otherwise, makes a humorous reappearance in 2.3, and in a more critical form. The stand-in satirist Damasippus, racing to add to his list of Horace's faults before he is silenced by the irritated poet, mentions "a style of dress beyond your means/station" (cultum / maiorem censu, 323-24). When we hold this passage up side by side with 1.6.78-80, the echo is suggestive: Horace's experience as a child, the text lets us infer, left him with a fondness for fine clothes. In addition, Horace's claim that his father kept him pudicus during his time in Rome (1.6.82-84; cf. 1.4.111-15) is humorously undercut by the other lecture delivered to him in Book 2. Davus the slave, who speaks in 2.7, accuses his master of adultery (te coniurnx aliena capit, 46). The lecture includes an amusing image of Horace cast in the role of the adulterer character from mime, hiding in a chest (59). While we applaud the care of the elder Horace, we cannot help noticing that his influence waned as his son got older.18 Horace's education scene in 1.6 ties into important themes in the Sermones, particularly the physical and ethical condition of the satirist figure. Horace's experience as a child is constructed to foreshadow his life as satirist, both in terms of his physical vulnerability and in terms of his moral inconsistency. This provides a model for Horace's successors in satire. In the remainder of this essay I will observe similar strategies in Persius and Juvenal; the educational autobiography is a generic device, but it takes a slightly different form in each poet's work. What remains consistent is the poets' declaration of their educational credentials in vignettes that fit their present identities as satirists. Henderson has identified in Persius' Satires a course in "Care of the Self" that posits, and yet mocks the idea of, the poet as an instructor in self-criticism. In this reading, Persius assumes authority by "staging his own formation," proffering his own educational story as a case study for his readers to examine.19 Henderson's analysis encourages a closer reading of the book's autobiographical passages, and the tribute to Persius' teacher Cornutus in Satire 5 stands out. For Henderson, the account of Cornutus' influence in the poem-"too good to be true"-participates in the book's critique of instruction-in- 18 I am grateful to the anonymous readers for pointing out, first, Horace's progression from comic son to a more low-brow mime character in these scenes, and second, a suggestive stylistic metaphor lurking in Horace's one retained habit of overdressing. 1 Henderson (1999) 237.</page><page sequence="8">222 CATHERINE KEANE independence.20 It will be useful to probe further into the passage that Henderson paraphrases, and to determine just what aspects of the student figure Persius emphasizes. If this narrative of transformation is less perfect than it seems at first glance, it will follow that the callow student represented there has connections to the present satirist figure, much as was the case in Horace. It will also be useful to examine other Persian images that relate to this passage, especially those that represent young characters. Persius constructs a satirist figure that is modeled on various characteristics of the child figure. Persius presents a memory that, like Horace's, focuses on the delicate transition into education (Satire 5.30-44): cum primum pavido custos mihi purpura cessit bullaque subcinctis Laribus donata pependit, cum blandi comites totaque inpune Subura permisit sparsisse oculos iam candidus umbo, cumque iter ambiguum est et vitae nescius error diducit trepidas ramosa in compita mentes, me tibi supposui. teneros tu suscipis annos, Socratico, Cornute, sinu. tum fallere sollers adposita intortos extendit regula mores et premitur ratione animus vincique laborat artificemque tuo ducit sub pollice voltum. tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes. unum opus et requiem pariter disponimus ambo atque verecunda laxamus seria mensa. Persius' student self is somewhat older than Horace's (having hung up his childhood bulla and begun the study of philosophy). The passage focuses on Persius' intense closeness to his teacher Cornutus, enhancing the description with literary echoes.21 But the picture of the poet at this tender age also evokes Sermones 1.6. Persius remembers trembling as he gave up his boy's gown (pavido...mihi, 30),22 and portrays that time of life as generally delicate (trepidas...mentes, 35; teneros...annos, 36). At the time of that fragile transition, a world of temptation lay open. The young poet- to-be had to reject his peers, Rome's red-light district, and the vaguely described "branching cross-roads" (ramosa...compita, 35) to join Cornutus in study and companionship. Like the schoolboy Horace, the young Persius is vulnerable, both morally and sexually. 20 Henderson (1999) 240-241. 21 Hooley (1997) 82-87 examines echoes of Horace, Catullus, Vergil, and Calli- machus in this passage. 22 For the argument that pavido describes the young man as opposed to the boy, i.e. that it refers to the moment after Persius donned his toga, see Kissel (1990) 605-606.</page><page sequence="9">SATIRIC MEMORIES 223 Interestingly, Persius' solution to the challenges of the iter ambiguum is to enter the "Socratic embrace" of his tutor (37). As Villeneuve and Hooley both note, it is hard not to think here of Alcibiades in Plato's Symposium, a character who suggests that there is a blurry line between philosophical instruction and sexual attachment." Persius' phrase evokes this ambiguous relationship. In addition, the verb laxamus which appears in 44 can have sexual connotations.24 Although Anderson contends that Persius' satirist is generally "monochromatic, even monotonous ... the steady incarnation of sapientia,"25 it is more accurate to say that this young student embodies vulnerability and potential for error. Persius' programmatic autobiography forces us to think in very vivid terms about the corporeal attributes of the student and future satirist. Persius imitates Horace's programmatic strategy of connecting the present poet with the young pupil, emphasizing the vulnerable state of the satirist. But the image of the satirist as student is considerably enriched in this new context. While Persius is not as present as a visible character as Horace is in his own satire, his associations with studenthood in this autobiographical reminiscence allow us to read certain other passages programmatically. I wish to point out two images which are especially central to Persius' satiric posture and which provide a background for the student who appears in Satire 5. Reading backwards through the book from that point of "graduation," we find a Stoic lecturing a lazy student in the third Satire. The scenario is programmatically significant in part because it imitates the third poem of Horace's second book of Sermones, and thus suggests a revision of Persius' predecessor. In Sermones 2.3, Horace is castigated by a newly-converted Stoic named Damasippus; Persius 3 borrows the scene of the late-rising, irritable poet. But while Horace makes his identity clear in his own version-thanks to the specifics offered by his interlocutor-Persius does not explicitly present this scenario as autobiographical. Editors and readers of Persius have long struggled with the question of which voice represents the satirist's (and also with the uncertain division of speaking roles in the poem). Persius might be speaking through the Stoic authority figure, the lazy student, neither character, or even both, with the speakers representing his higher and lower selves.26 For those who are reluctant to see the moralizing speaker as Persius, 23 Cf. Plato's Symposium 215a4-22b7. For the connection see Villeneuve (1918) 119 and Hooley (1997) 81. Persius' interest in Alcibiades is demonstrated in Satire 4; see Hooley (1997) 122-53 and Henderson (1999) 239-40. 24 See Adams (1982) 173. I thank the referee who provided this citation. 25 Anderson (1982) 179. 26 A summary of the arguments made about the arrangement of parts can be found in Hooley (1997) 202-207.</page><page sequence="10">224 CATHERINE KEANE one factor is this passage in which the character admits to a checkered past (Satire 3.44-47): saepe oculos, memini, tangebam parvus olivo, grandia si nollem morituri verba Catonis discere non sano multum laudanda magistro, quae pater adductis sudans audiret amicis.27 The elder speaker confesses to this boyhood transgression in order to ingratiate himself with the lazy student. In a combination of positive and negative example, by admitting to his own former laziness and trick of feigning illness, this speaker can better encourage his interlocutor to overcome his reluctance to study. Whether or not we are meant to see the child as Persius is immaterial; what is striking is that this reminiscence comes from a person now assuming a position of moral and intellectual authority.2 In the scheme that Henderson sees in Persius, this image of imperfection (as well as self- disfigurement) is as viable a model for the now-teaching satirist as any other. This child's insubordination recalls an earlier passage in Persius, also involving a child and in fact containing a recognizable symbol for the act of satire. In Satire 1, an interlocutor warns the satirist not to foul society with his criticisms: "hic" inquis "veto quisquam faxit oletum." / pingue duos anguis: "pueri, sacer est locus, extra / meiite" (112-14). The metaphor of satire as soiling through various bodily functions is unmistakable.29 Bramble analyzes the child's satiric gesture in this way: "From [Roman society's] point of view, such behavior is culpable and irresponsible. But for Persius, the child's proposition [to dirty a sacred space] is a justifiable comment on the adult world."30 Evoking a transgressive or harmful gesture meant to make a moral statement, it resonates with Persius' descriptions of the writing of satire as scornful laughter (cachinno, 12), scraping the ears of his listeners (quid opus teneras mordaci radere...auriculas? 107-108), 27 According to the ancient Life of Persius, the poet lost his father by age six, and his stepfather a few years later; thus he would never have declaimed for either of them. For further arguments about the plausibility of the story in Satire 3 (based on its implications about the moral character of the speaker) see Tate (1928 and 1929) and ter Vrugt-Lentz (1970) 483-84. 28 Forsyth (1976) argues that throughout his Satires, Persius stages dialogues between older and younger characters in order to bring the generations to a common understanding (on the passage in Satire 3 see 218-19). 29 See Richlin (1992) 26-30. 30 Bramble (1974) 185; cf. 135-36. Meanwhile Satire 1 begins with mockery of gray-bearded elders: cum ad canitiem et nostrum istud vivere triste / aspexi ac nucibus facimus quaecumque relictis / cum sapimus patruos....cachinno (9-12). But the child in Satire 3 is differentiated from the heroic, outspoken child of 1: Bramble (1974) 188 categorizes the vignette at 3.44-47 as one of the "unsympathetic" images of the child in satire.</page><page sequence="11">SATIRIC MEMORIES 225 and, as Lucilius practiced it at least, cutting into the city with his teeth (secuit Lucilius urbem...et genuinum fregit in illis, 114-15).31 These images represent Persius' version of the satiric violence evoked in Horace's apologiae. The images from Satires 1 and 3 allow us to consider the child, and by association the satirist, as a figure with certain conflicting attributes. Like the satirist, the child can be represented as a embodiment of both moral heroism and insubordination. Persius encourages us to see these characteristics in his version of the satirist figure. The reluctant schoolboy of Satire 3 is thus connected to the satirist in two ways: first, the speaker who is remembering his childhood is the main speaker of the poem (and thus, for many readers, sounds like the satirist) and second, in his main program poem Persius has already offered the mischievous child as one symbol of the satirist. Thus the description in Satire 5 of the young Persius entering the pedagogical process and all of the dangers of adolescence acquires further dimension. If we view him in the context of the whole book, that youth is not only a vulnerable student like Horace's version, but a figure associated with both transgression and high-mindedness. This embedded history of the student figure, beginning with disobedience and progressing through various problematic and edifying encounters, becomes part of the satirist figure's image as well. Compared with the use of the student figure in Horace and Persius, Juvenal's own vignette of education stands out in several respects. First, it is extremely brief, not only in that it consists of just over two lines, but also in that it represents virtually the only information that the poet provides about himself. Second, Juvenal announces this memory near the beginning of his first Satire, in contrast to the delayed memories of his predecessors. Horace and Persius present their memories after building up a thematic background in the course of the book. Juvenal re-forms the autobiographical convention by presenting us with the significant information up-front-and only then. Finally, because Juvenal's work is short on other autobiographical comments which could respond to aspects of the education vignette, its thematic links with the rest of his poetry are manifested differently. Where Horace and Persius each create a complex of related images of the satirist figure, Juvenal builds his image in more oblique ways. Still, our reading of Horace and Persius provides direction on reading the educational autobiography as a programmatic device. Juvenal writes: et nos ergo manum ferulae subduximus, et nos / 31 These last lines recall a Lucilian fragment describing a dog's snarl (fr. 3-4 W), which may originally have appeared in a programmatic context; see Shero (1922) 164- 67.</page><page sequence="12">226 CATHERINE KEANE consilium dedimus Sullae, privatus uit altum / dormiret (15-17). The satirist's memory focuses on two aspects of his school days: his physical abuse by the master, and his training in typical suasoriae such as the retirement advice to Sulla. As I noted earlier, the second detail has garnered more attention than the first, since it reads like a hint from the poet that his work is a carefully composed performance rather than a passionate outburst. Juvenal has just been cataloguing trite epic themes (7-11), suggesting that poetry-writing involves learning and following formulas. By characterizing contemporary poetry in this way, Juvenal makes the literary scene out to be an industry which, by virtue of his education, he is perfectly qualified to join.32 The prominence of declamation in the young Juvenal's schooling recalls the intransigent student of Persius 3.44-47, who was given Catonian speeches to practice. But there is more to be said about Juvenal's memory of corporal punishment at school, a detail that has gone largely unexamined apart from identification of a possible allusion to Horace's Epistles.33 The violent image in the school vignette is part of a tradition. Like Horace's representation of the satirist, Juvenal's self-portrait emphasizes physical vulnerability. And as in Persius' images from Satires 1 and 3, there is a hint of cheekiness in the young Juvenal, seen in his impulse to avoid the master's rod (manum ferulae subduximus).34 Also reminiscent of Horace and Persius is the way that Juvenal's educational autobiography connects with his other descriptions of the satirist figure. In the case of Juvenal, there are just a few such images concentrated in the first Satire, and their overarching theme is violence. As Juvenal depicts him in the poem, the author of satire stands poised to react to assaults on his safety and sanity. The poetry-recitals of the opening passage are described as assaults on Juvenal's ears and on the recital venues themselves.35 And according to the famous image near the end of the poem, the poet is in danger of extreme retaliation from higher powers whom he might offend 32 The epic pastiche of lines 7-13 serves as proof of this, according to Henderson (1999) 257-67. 33 E.g. Ferguson (1979) 112, which refers to Horace's memory of his teacher "Orbilius the Flogger" (plagosum Orbilium) at Epistles 2.1.70-71. 3 Henderson (1999) 269 is alone in noting Juvenal's "boast [of] punishment cheated" and speculates briefly that this behavior is meant as a characterization of the satirist; he is, however, more intrigued by the Sulla suasoria (see below). " In the first Satire Juvenal describes poetry recitals as assaults on his person (numquamne reponam / vexatus totiens...? 1-2). Violence appears in the epics that annoy the satirist (quas torqueat umbras / Aeacus, 9-10; quantas iaculetur Monychus ornos, 11). The very recital venues experience the strain of constant bad poetry (Frontonis platani convolsaque marmora clamant / semper et adsiduo ruptae lectore columnae, 12-13).</page><page sequence="13">SATIRIC MEMORIES 227 (155-57).36 In the same section of the poem, Juvenal paints Lucilius as the archetypal heroic satirist, who practices a kind of corrective violence by brandishing his poetry "like a drawn sword" (ense velut stricta, 165; cf. the Republican racing his figurative chariot through the field of satire at 19-20). These images recall Horace's use of animal and martial imagery in programmatic contexts, as well as the vulnerable condition of his young student-satirist. Persius, as we saw, picks up on this imagery with his description of "scraping" and "cutting" satiric poetry. Violence, both offensive and defensive, is at the heart of satire's identity, and the young Juvenal experiences this first-hand. Viewed in the context of Juvenal's programmatic first Satire, the education scene fits well. But it must be noted that the differences between Juvenal's satirist figure and those of his predecessors affect that figure's thematic relation to the larger context. While Juvenal upholds the satirist's associations with violence in Satire 1, in the rest of the corpus he denies readers any additional images of himself that would reassert or develop that connection. This decline in self- referential moments means that the satirist's character is defined and expressed in a new manner. Two recognized features of Juvenalian satire take on special significance here: stand-ins who pose as satirists and thus offer more visible bodies than Juvenal's, and the activity in many narrative scenes, which often re-enacts the violence that the young Juvenal supposedly experienced. First, much as the Priapus of Sermones 1.8 functions as a satirist figure, some characters in Juvenal's poems deliver tirades like that in Satire 1. The most developed of these characters are Umbricius in Satire 3, a fictional friend of the poet who claims to speak for the disenfranchised urban poor, and Naevolus in 9, an aging gigolo who finds himself out of favor. As Braund has shown, these characters pose as indignant satirist-figures much like the one who delivers Satire 1.37 They are alter egos for Juvenal (though Naevolus represents a satiric style that the poet himself has abandoned by the third book3), and are at the same time made visible to us as characters and as bodies. In this regard they recall the vulnerable young Juvenal of 1.15-17. Umbricius resents being edged out of city 36 pone Tigellinum, taeda lucebis in illa / qua stantes ardent quifixo gutturefumant / et latum media sulcum deducit harena. 37 A comparable alter ego, who has a smaller part, is Laronia at Satire 2.36-65, on whom see Braund (1995). On the rhetoric and character of Umbricius see Braund (1988) 11-15; on Naevolus see Braund (1988) 130-77 and Rosen (1996). Braund's thesis regarding Satire 9 (and all of Book 3) is that Juvenal has given up the indignant style of satire and now mocks that style by putting Naevolus on display. I do not intend to challenge this reading by identifying Naevolus as version of the satirist figure. -8 A similar tactic can be seen in the address to Calvinus in Satire 13; see Braund (1988) 189-91.</page><page sequence="14">228 CATHERINE KEANE life by foreigners, nouveaux riches, and various other charlatans, but his worries also include being killed or impoverished by an apartment-fire (198-211), crushed by a mob (239-67), hit by debris falling from windows (268-77), or beaten by thugs (278-301). Naevolus, for his part, finds his personal appearance deteriorating from worry and neglect (so observes his interlocutor at Satire 9.12-17; the former dandy is unshaven and unkempt, with matted hair and a grim expression). This kind of physical damage, although more subtle than the nightmares of the pauper in Satire 3, is another manifestation of the vulnerability of the satiric body. It relates both to the comic aspects of the satirist figure (e.g. Horace's professed physical ailments) and to the resentful, disempowered posture that Juvenal adopts in his first two books of Satires. Umbricius and Naevolus, who deliver satire themselves, are characterized by vulnerable and troubled bodies that mirror their social position. Juvenal also projects the themes of his autobiography onto his narrative material. Violence, after all, is far more common in Juvenal's narrative scenes than in those of Horace and Persius. Images of abuse and mutilation are abundant. In addition to the aforementioned street brawls in Satire 3, violence occurs at the dinner hosted by the cruel Virro, where the poor clients quickly turn their anger on one another (Satire 5.26-29). Thus the recurrent cena scene of the genre, afflicted in Horace only by small mishaps and raillery, takes on a particularly Juvenalian flavor.39 In Satire 15, residents of two Egyptian towns begin a scuffle that escalates into battle; eventually (in an even more distorted cena) pursuers catch, dismember, and eat one straggler. A civilian, encountering an arrogant soldier, is thrashed to the point of losing an eye at 16.8-12. We read of masters and mistresses cruelly beating their slaves at 6.475-93 and 14.18-24, and of the various violent methods for punish- ing adulterers at 10.311-17. Human features on anthropomorphic statues are seen mutilated at 8.4-5, 10.61-64, and 13.150-53. Elaborate carving of meats, as an intimidating display of wealth and power, is another example of indirect violence (5.120-24 and 11.136-41). And the assorted death scenes in Juvenal include one particularly pathetic example at 3.257-67, where an unlucky city-dweller is crushed to unrecognizable pieces. These scenes represent only a handful of the violent images that characterize Juvenal as the most savage of the Roman satirists, not merely in the rhetorical tone best known from Books 1 and 2, but also in subject matter from all over the collection. From the above observations we can conclude that Juvenal's autobiography distills and personalizes a theme that will be 39 Cf. the cena scenes in Sermones 1.3.90-93, 1.4.86-89, and 2.8. I thank the referee who suggested I view Juvenal's mealtime violence in the context of satire's etymological and thematic associations with food.</page><page sequence="15">SATIRIC MEMORIES 229 prevalent in the poems to come. Further connections are also possible: for instance, Juvenal later comments on both the intransigence of young students (Satire 7.210-214) and the blameless impressionability of children when surrounded by vice (the theme of Satire 14). This double image of children recalls Persius and offers a context in which to view Juvenal's vulnerable, flawed young satirist. Regarding another detail of the autobiographical passage, Henderson writes that the future poet's suasoria to Sulla alludes to his satire's intolerance of tyrants.40 The more we read on, the more the satirist's memory of childhood appears to have been constructed to introduce the world of his poetry. Nevertheless, the difference between Juvenal's brief, introductory autobiography and the more integrated versions of his predecessors is clear. In effect, Juvenal's autobiography looks both backward and forward. When stating his educational credentials so early in his first Satire, Juvenal gestures to the practice of Horace and Persius. The theme of education coincides with the reinforcement of a satiric topos, and this underscores the programmatic and symbolic potential of that theme. Juvenal's "education" consists not only literally of rhetorical training, but metaphorically of the satiric tradition passed on to him by Horace and Persius. At the same time, Juvenal's young self heralds a new version of the genre, in which the satirist's autobiography ends after he first introduces himself. In this version, while the motifs presented in the poet's autobiography are pervasive, the poet himself allows the narrative and other speaking characters to take over. While the satirist figures in Horace, Persius, and Juvenal are all defined by the poetry of which they are a part, Juvenal's satire represents this phenomenon most starkly by effectively absorbing its spokesman. The brief anecdote of Juvenal's education at Satire 1.15-17 does not only serve as a signal of declamatory influence on his poetry, but has a generic pedigree. Although the Roman satirists' autobiographical digressions are dubious as historical evidence, they are present for a reason; I have argued that that reason is the contruction of a figure who represents the satiric genre. What the image of the young poet lacks in historical value, it makes up for in thematic and programmatic relevance. Horace introduces the "artful autobiography" (as Anderson would dub it) that is largely centered on education but that allows glimpses of the adult poet as imperfect graduate; he also takes care to emphasize in his reminiscence the same vulnerability that he claims to feel as satirist. Persius borrows this theme for his tribute to Cornutus, presenting an idealized scene that nevertheless does not conceal the threats to the future poet, or the mischievous boy who also serves as Persius' model. The least 40 Henderson (1999) 269.</page><page sequence="16">230 CATHERINE KEANE autobiographical of the satirists, Juvenal, confines his reminiscence almost exclusively to the experience of violence. This emphasizes the satirist figure's longstanding association with that activity, and is echoed elsewhere in Juvenal's poetry. Traditional programmatic images of satire account for the recurrent themes of violence and vulnerability in the satiric autobiography. But it is especially significant that the poets treat the topic in a context that is presented as highly personal. I have attempted to support the argument that there are useful ways of reading autobiographical references in satire, without challenging the persona theory or misunderstanding poetic passages as historical evidence. The kinds of passages that were deemed historically unreliable by those who developed the persona theory, and that have since been reconsidered in the thematic contexts of the individual authors, now need to be read in the context of our growing understanding of the genre. The persona has for some time been considered the most definitive convention of satire, but we can only recognize its full potential as such when we listen closely to its fictions.
