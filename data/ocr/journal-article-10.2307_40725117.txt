Gregory Center for International and Strategic Affairs University of California Los Angeles THE DICTATOR'S FURNACE: METAPHOR AND ALCHEMY IN NATIONAL SECURITY DISCOURSE The need of security against aggression is, as Hamilton said, "the most powerful dictator of na- tional conduct". - Edward Mead Earle (1940) 1. Unpacking a Metaphor* Before either the atomic bomb or the Soviet "threat", a certain set of attitudes - a view of reality heightened by World War II urgencies - had already instigated a new defense policy within the western democracies. As Edward Mead Earle put it in 1940, "Total War can be met only by planning for Total Defense ... [This is not] likely to be a transitory phase in the history of the world".1 Even before World War I, war technology had provided the means of "Total War" in the railroad and the airplane. When Earle and others sounded the call for a new defense policy in the 1940s, both World War IPs scope and our ruthless Nazi enemy made "Total Defense" - a high degree of mobilization - seem an urgent necesity. The war made more obvious the quantum leaps that, in only two decades, had been accomplished in the engines of destruction. The role of war's machines in causing wars is no simple issue. It is often treated simply, though, both by those who condemn weaponry as war's provoca- teur and by those who hail it as war's preventive. In- stead, attitudes toward weapons are part of an intri- cate set of beliefs both about science and technology and about our powers of initiative as human beings. One's view of war technology is part of a larger view. It reflects one's picture of how human political cultures work, one's sense of human agency or relative passiv- ity within such cultures, and one's quasi-scientific model of the cosmos and humanity's place in it. Atti- tudes toward technology are implicated in whether, and on what terms, one is willing to assume some responsibility for human history. In the midst of World War II, the new American political realists repeatedly raised questions about responsibility. In urging a stronger defense both dur- ing World War II and in the nuclear age, phrases like "This is not of our choice" and "This is the truth, how- ever tragic" punctuated their discourse. A greater commitment to military preparedness than most democracies wanted was, arguably, a necessity. The realists spoke of this need for more mobilization in peace time as a tragic imposition of fate. But fate, it seemed, prevented much analysis of how much pre- paredness we needed, particularly after the atomic bomb. Reality seemed to prevent this analysis: we had a new enemy, and they had - or soon would have - the bomb, too. Yet the force that so compelled us to acquire a massive nuclear arsenal was not "real- ity" or "fate" or even the threat of "Total War". Instead it was really only a metaphor. However, it was a meta- phor that encompassed a dazzingly intricate set of assumptions, packing together anxieties so intense that it had the power both to represent and to create a whole world. This essay unpacks that metaphor. It is thus con- cerned with "literary fabrications". Aware of how these work, we can reread nuclear age history. Re- examining key documents from this perspective reveals some peculiar dimensions of our nuclear estate, particularly the creative, transformative powers of language artfully used. In the late 1950s, during nuclear strategists' purge of expository prose in favor of mathematical models, one Rand Corporation strategist condemned most early nuclear strategy as being "in the essay tradition". Whether Albert Wohlstetter's contempt of the expo- sitory nature of early strategy is deserved or not, it's that tradition that allows lay readers to understand thinking about nuclear weapons in a way they cannot understand today's highly technical and technol- ogized analyses. Obscured beneath today's arcane vocabularly, the basic principles of nuclear strategy 47</page><page sequence="2">and their underlying assumptions haven't changed since they were first articulated in readable English prose during the 1940s and early 50s. Indeed, the first strategic nuclear analysis come from a man schooled in the classical liberal arts. In 1946, two essays Bernard Brodie wrote on the bomb and its policy implications appeared in his edited volume, The Absolute Weapon: Atomic Power and World Order} Fortunately for us, a man like Brodie, con- sidered both the best of all strategic thinkers and the father of strategy's moderate wing, made these first excursions into nuclear strategy. Brodie's work spans the nuclear divide, extending from 1941 until his death in 1978. His thoughful and subtle work thus shows an evolution of military strategy from prenu- clear to nuclear thinking, and therefore it merits our attention. Language can tacitly, as well as overtly, enunciate whole sets of attitudes, intensities, and attachments that extend far beyond meanings we consciously sti- pulate. While not a new idea, this one identifies a way to decode meaning that can generate some stunning insights. Herein, we'll see how linguistic reification in Brodie's representations of military force reflects a coherent vision of the world. This vision explains why the political realists saw "fate" at work in our opting for a massive nuclear arsenal, rather than believing that we had a wide range of choices and the ability to discriminate between them. 2. The Weapons Race Brodie opens one of his essays saying: Under conditions existing before the atomic bomb, it was possible to contemplate methods of air defense keeping pace with and perhaps even outdistancing the means of offense. Long-range rockets baffled the defense, but they were ex- tremely expensive per unit for inaccurate, single- blow weapons. Against bombing aircraft, on the other hand, fighter planes and antiaircraft guns could be extremely effective (p. 70). At first glance, most readers would probably agree that the passage is straightforward and clear. The pas- sage is framed in time as describing how things were "before the atomic bomb". In this time, it says, we could realistically expect that we could depend on air defense to counter offensive strategies. The next para- graph will tell us how things have changed after the atomic bomb - we cannot depend on air defense any more. (This is the argument of the essay: we will need a radically new strategy to replace defense, which will be called "deterrence".) It makes sense from a grammatical perspective why the passage is relatively easy to grasp. This language is concrete, descriptive, and action-packed. Weapons systems are identified by concrete nouns: the atomic bomb, rockets, bombing aircraft, fighter planes, antiaircraft guns. Weapon systems stand as the subj ect of all the clauses after sentence one. A race metaphor structures the action throughout This metaphor de- scribes how in those days means of defense - radar search and tracking, proximity-fused projectiles, fighter planes and antiaircraft guns - could race against bombers and other means of offense and beat them. Air defense could "keep pace" and even "out- distance" most forms of offense. Long-range rockets alone had "baffled" defensive countermeasures; but these rockets were inaccurate, singleblow, and ex- tremely expensive, all of which diminished their overall power. However, the meanings in the passage are not fully encompassed in this straightforward and superficial account. When we think about it, the terms "offense" and "defense" do not refer to weapons engaged in a con- test, as the passage purports to have it Rather, they refer to functions weapons and other forces may serve in a war strategy. Here, then, the terms are metaphors for such strategic functions. They represent what human beings must conceptualize when they want to develop one weapon system to counter another weapon system. On one hand, this dimension of meaning is obvious to readers since the passage lit- erally refers not to a war of weapons but to the mili- tary strategist's cognitive experience of anticipating the next combat to which his (or her) skills will be called. But on the other hand, its grammar, which posits active agents pacing, outdistancing, and baffling opposing agents, points to something in addition to the strategist's cognitive experience. By using "offense" and "defense" as nouns - that is, reifying them, turning them into things - and by adding the "race" metaphor which provides a pattern for the weapons' interactions, Brodie turns weapons research and development (R&amp;D) into a cosmic drama The entire passage reifies the weapons design process, speaking about that complex and amor- phous process as if it were accurately representable as a concrete thing. This linguistic reification process distracts us read- ers and therefore, it leads us to think through the issue incompletely. Images of weapons racing each other draw our inner eye to pictures of aerial combat and mechanical armies in the sky. So engaged, we're un- likely to think about people making and imple- 48</page><page sequence="3">meriting decisions in scientific research labs or government offices down on earth. The real-world referent fades, dominated by a more vivid, more graspable picture. Thus while such metaphorical representations of the design process fascinate us, they contribute nothing to our understanding that process. In fact, they actually hinder our under- standing by obscuring the process. Our vision of an "arms race" becomes transposed onto our under- standing of strategic necessities, which finally dis- places any detailed awareness we might otherwise have of a normal research and development process.3 The way has been paved to institutionalize an arms race. 3. The Mechanical Ballet Besides obscuring the complexities of the R&amp;D process, the reifications have another effect. While making human beings and their activities invisible, they raise into the foreground a fictional world of smart, fast machines. These machines are not merely the ones we know in the real world. Through the magic of metaphor, these war machines acquire con- sciousness and will. They engage in battle, run races, and act intelligently without human agency. They do the things humans do while the humans watch, like parents at their children's dance recital. Machines excite, fire our concern, and perform to the thunder of our admiring applause. Mechanical power substitutes for the living world's own vitality. And while we watch them perform, we forget that we take these embattled machines seriously precisely because they are repre- sented as if they were people. In our mind's eye, they have been anthropomorphically transformed. In combination with this transposition of human qualities onto weapons, the reifications have a third effect. They render human beings passive against this backdrop of superior vitality and power. Brodie's representation gives the weapons great power and diminishes human power. Consider how small is the hint of human presence in Brodie's first line. Before the atomic bomb, Brodie says, "it was possible to contemplate ..." defense as a viable strategy. What we "contemplate" is the "existing conditions" weapons systems impose, together with their cumulative force and the technological capabilities of inventing and producing them. The capabilities of weapons systems determine the range of possible strategies for using them, a fact we needn't dispute. But we should look with surprise if strategic "conditions" are taken as given rather than as implicated in man-made pro- cesses. Moreover, such "conditions" are no small matter, given or not; for though the strategic "conditions" existing at a given time matter greatly to defense pol- icies, the significance of these conditions is not re- stricted to policies. Instead, weapons systems deter- mine also the broader "conditions" for life since wea- pons ultimately guarantee the national state or fail to do so. (We recall Edward Mead Earle invoking the Constitution, and declaring national defense "the basic function" of government.) By metonymy, the part comes to stand for the whole, for in the end, nothing less fundamental than an equation between weapons systems and the conditions for life generally could account for such a close attention to the nature and powers of weapons systems. To Brodie, because we now will owe our very existence to possessing the atomic bomb, the "conditions" the atomic bomb imposes seem rightfully to command our contempla- tive attention. Then, to represent human beings as fate's humble servants makes even more sense after the bomb's advent. The bomb will impose "condi- tions" commanding our servitude. Military force then, in Brodie's early writings, is represented in some striking ways. It is ever-increas- ing in power, exciting, clever, intelligent, auton- omous, mysteriously generated (perhaps even tran- scendent) and determines human destiny. Admirable human qualities are displaced to weapons, while humans have become relatively ever more impotent. In all, technological progress, depicted as having its own vital momentum, seems never to have been under human control. Rather, in their military research, development and procurement, and in their security policies, human beings are handmaidens to a technological imperative much larger than human society, and much more determining. 4. The Insatiable Appetite of the Ship's Furnace The view that human beings serve some technologi- cal imperative greater than themselves was already quite apparent in Brodie's dissertation, Sea Power in the Modern Age4 (1941), written under Edward Mead Earle's supervision; the book examines 19th and early 20th century naval inventions and assesses their influence on war, state power, and military strategy. It views technological progress in weaponry as unrelenting, a fact to which humanity must be alert and responsive. New weapons arise to counter enemy weapons, themselves originally counters to another 49</page><page sequence="4">enemy's counter technology, and so on. It is an endless dialectic in which "each Power [sic] finds it necessary to further these inventions to avoid falling hopelessly behind in the inexorable race for technical advantage" (Sea Power, p. 7). War's own logic makes weapons evolution inevitable, and through this evolu- tion, war technology achieves an autonomous life. Brodie represents this "necessity", this bondage to "the inexorable race for technical advantage", by an arresting figure of speech: "the insatiable appetite of the ship's furnace". The "furnace's appetite" explains and stands for inexorable weapons production. Thus, the metaphor of "the ship's furnace" substitutes for a causal theory. The "furnace" is what drives weapons evolution always toward "weapons more violent". From sail to steam to armor-hulled battleships and ultimately to submarines, naval weapons progressed in only a century; by 1941, the "furnace" had pro- duced a weapon - the submarine - that could for the first time menace "a whole world order". War could now be "Total War". This metaphor, then, concretizes the process of technological change, rendering that process like a machine. The furnace is a weapons producer whose products ever increase in destructive power and whose numbers and kinds increase at an ever-hastening rate. The metaphor's fuller context resembles the 1946 paragraph we first examined. This metaphor appears most dramatically in Sea Power's final paragraph, a summary passage epitomizing the patterns of tech- nological change and strategic adaptation Brodie analyzes throughout the book: Sail gives way to steam and timber walls to iron, vessels of war take cover in the depths of the sea and spread their wings far above the crests of the waves, but naval war remains much the same in its purposes and in its accomplishments. Yet how different may be the conditions under which sea power fulfills its mission! The insatiable appetite of the ship's furnace alters the strategy of nations. The submarine attaches to itself the far-ranging eyes of the airplane and threatens a whole world order, including much that was never menaced before. And no one in the day of crisis can be certain that it will be parried. The appetite of the ship's furnace alters national strategy: with the new submarine and airborne radar, war on unprecedented global scale is possible. At the propositional level of meaning, the passage simply sums up the book's argument: War's own logic makes weapons evolution inevitable, and while this ongoing evolution changes the conditions of naval war, still it does not change naval warfare's basic aims. In practical terms, the book offered the Navy reassur- ance against the threat that airplanes posed to naval power by showing how air power could supplement sea power. (In the first three editions of his next book, A Layman's Guide to Naval Strategy,5 1942, 1943, 1944, Brodie would offer repeated assurances that air- planes had not made the Navy obsolete. Not until autumn of 1945 would Brodie decide that air power had stolen the Navy's pre-eminence and forced a thorough rethinking of war strategy.) This passage, however, suggests a less recognizable reality than we see at first glance. Consider the actions of these machines. The verbs are nearly all active in voice: give way, take cover, spread, fulfill, alter, attach, threaten. The military technologies function both as the grammatical subjects and as the agents of all this activity: Sail gives way to steam, timber walls give way to iron walls; war vessels both take cover in the sea's depths and they spread their wings far above the sea. The machines of sea power fulfill their mission, and the ship's furnace alters national strategies. By implication these machines have amazing powers which are autonomously directed. Again we have anthropomorphic transformation. This time, however, the war machines have exotic attributes. They are gigantic sea animals, which "take cover in the depths of the sea and spread their wings far above the crests of the waves", like flying am- phibians or pterodactyls. The submarine is said to "attach to itself' the airplane's "eyes". Having wrought this bizarre interspecies cooperation, this hybrid monster then "threatens a whole world order". The metaphors, verbs, and syntactical constructions create a picture of immensely powerful creatures imbued with human-like will and intelligence. They, like those in the 1946 text, can act freely and power- fully without human grammatical subjects manning their controls. As in the 1946 essay, human beings are all but absent. Not until the final sentence does Brodie shift away from animal activities to human activities. Here, the action is knowing, and the sentence raises a ques- tion about "certainty". "We", the sentence's human subjects, are cast as being uncertain, here in early 1941, as having inadequate knowledge about the power of war's current machines: "No one ... can be certain that [the submarine menace] will be parried". We, which is encoded as "no one", emerge very small and insignificant against the backdrop of great mechanized power and activity that dominates those many sentences before we - "no one" - finally appeared. And no wonder: ultimately the contest of 50</page><page sequence="5">giants will decide the war's outcome. We, who only build the things, can't be certain how they will inter- act. And we don't really "build" them, but rather we facilitate their being by serving the furnace's hungry demands. 5. The Thermostat Brodie's view that the genesis of war technology eludes human control was, then, an attitude he had held for some years. In fact it was a commonplace atti- tude and remains so today in the military and strategic communities. While the furnace metaphor expresses this attitude, it also blinds Brodie to the vexing ques- tion of causality and control. The "insatiable furnace" metaphor stands for the cause of the whole weapons production process. But simply naming the cause, particularly with a metaphor, neither helps to identify it nor to analyze it; at the same time, giving the cause a name certainly obscures this problematical question about genesis. "War's own logic" is not enough to explain the process, because this, too, is a metaphor: human understanding imputes to war any logic that is believed to be found in war. A third metaphor pur- porting to account for weapons production require- ments harkens back to Alexander Hamilton's words, which Brodie had taken to heart: "the need of security against aggression is ... 'the most powerful dictator of national conduct"9. This phrase, which at first may seem at least to identify "the need for security against aggression" as the cause, still does not analyze this cause. It does not tell us how absolute is this "dicta- tor", to whom he dictates, from where, in what lin- guistic code, and so on. Besides obscuring the pres- sures generating the weapons and allegedly necessi- tating vast numbers of them, the "insatiable furnace" metaphor is so complex and captivating an image that it even obscures its own implications: It does not invite us to ask whether the furnace has a thermostat, and if so, how it's set and if not, why we don't add one. If we search hard, we find in Sea Power an important clue about the thermostat. There is one, but it's been cranked up as high as it can go, the act has been thoroughly justified, and it has been long forgot- ten. The "thermostat" represents the perceived need for national power to provide national security, mea- sured in military terms. Brodie argues that in pre-nu- clear times, at any rate, military victories produced national prestige, which was (and remains) the main currency of state power {Sea Power, pp. 18, 434). Power, after all - a state's power to impose its will, as Clausewitz put it - is the purpose ofthat inexorable pursuit of technological advantage. "Power", like the "prestige" it generates (which in turn creates more power) is another name for what the ship's furnace produces. The ship's furnace is a power generator driving the ship of state, stocking its arsenals with the means - the weapons systems and other forces - to ensure its sur- vival and wellbeing. The furnace is a transformer; it is an alchemist's alembic, the beaker where gold and lead are transmuted. It works like a belly: It is both stomach - an insatiable consumer of national resources - and it is womb - a generative source of war machines evolving every new generation. The alemb- ic transforms natural, financial, and human resources into war power. How much power, which is scaled on a non-existent thermostat, is decided not by a demo- cratic legislature but by the Dictator of National Con- duct. The Dictator's rule is as absolute as his judge- ment is inscrutable. Inaccessible to ordinary citizens, the Dictator - or the Dictates of National Security - needs an army of handmaidens, the national security establishment, to decode, translate, scramble or pro- nounce his dictates. The war machines, in this "reality", become an in- exorable Nature, a terrible Mother whom mankind serves. War machines are the given, the changing but positive fact determinative of human history. The ultimate verbal alchemy has occurred: metaphors, themselves fictional or secondary meanings, have become implicated in a primary reality. A world has been made, and no one is responsible. In literal terms, "reality" gets reflected in our language, which in turn strongly tends to confirm our particular perception. Similarly, policies created out of a particular perspec- tive will tend to create conditions in reality that con- firm that view. If counter technology drives war machine production in fact, this situation partly results from our having assented to and confirmed this fact. In this situation, our language is what compels our beliefs about reality, not an objectively existing reality that commands perception and belief. Understanding how our language works can, there- fore, give us more options in the world we make and to which we assent. 6. Conclusion Today, we still disagree about who, or what social forces, should set the thermostat, deciding how much power we need. In early deterrence theory, the com- pelling vision of an anthropomorphic, vitalistic tech- nology decided the question by putting it beyond 51</page><page sequence="6">dispute: We needed as much power as we could get without damage to democratic institutions. But this qualifier went unanalyzed. What is damage to demo- cratic institutions? Who is to judge? By what criteria? And by what order of priority? Today the doctrine of "national security", the mature legacy of early real- ist thinking, establishes that priority. The dictator's furnace, "national security", decides policy questions in its own absolute terms. In our emerging, post-Cold War world, policymak- ers still accept as given the principle of maximum power to ensure maximum security. The loss of the Soviet Threat from policy discourse has, temporarily, forced deterrence theorists into a frenzy of revision- ism. Yet, if we momentarily lack an enemy, we should expect the void will be quickly filled. The most obvious interim candidate is the Furnace's latest child: we will be asked in the name of National Secur- ity to fight against enemies of technological progress. We will need massive appropriations to high tech research just to keep pace, microchip by nanosecond, with the insatiable furnace driving all nations. Bernard Brodie's contribution to nuclear strategy per se is differently judged by factions within the security community. His articulations of a realist per- spective both before Hiroshima and during the nu- clear age provide valuable historical information on this perspective and its influence on security thinking, broadly conceived. Both the national security para- digm and nuclear deterrence theory are products of American political realism. But, for all its limitations, realism could be yet a richer form of political thinking than the myriad forms of "unrealism". In this regard, one task for the peace research is to focus on a richer analysis than realism provides of the living dynamic between our belief systems and perceptions and our actions in the world. Most particularly this means publicizing the ways our language can reinforce our beliefs and compel our actions. Four practical approaches suggest themselves in the present essay. All focus on the kind of cosmos implied in realist discourse. As we have seen in this brief analysis, it is a cosmos much like the one depict- ed by Hesiod: Titans clash and big things happen in a domain of hostile energy somehow separate from our control. Though this dimension is seen to affect us intimately, it is not seen as of our making. It is imposed upon us, and our primary task is to survive it The first approach, then, involves examining the real- ist assumption about hostility and aggressivity as in- evitable and as determining. The second approach involves examining the implied cosmos itself. It resembles the science fiction world of an embattled adolescent still under parental domination. Could it be that many of our policy intel- lectuals are immature? This possibility deserves seri- ous consideration. Third, how is it that our policy intellectuals and the university faculty of elite univer- sities who train them are predominantly realists? Are we helpless in this, or merely unaware? Finally, realists note that countries typically get power through military prestige - either through actual victories or through conspicuous displays of force. Is this fact not determined at the level of popu- lar culture? It is not so much "militarism" or even weapons fetishism that we need to look at, but the psychology of prestige and fetishizing. What kind of people are susceptible to these, how are they raised and schooled, and what do they do for fun? Questions as mundane as these appear to be the key to changing the ideology whose metaphors cur- rently drive our security policy.
