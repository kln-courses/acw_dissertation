Griswold "Those who take their stand on what is literally expressed, without comprehending what was expressed, fall into the bondage of mortality; those who understand what was really indicated form no vain concepts of him who makes the indication.'' SAMYUTTA NIKAYA 1. The Heritage of Sukhodaya In the heart of the Southeast Asia Peninsula, halfway between Bangkok and the northern frontier of Siam, lie the ruins of Sukhodaya. The site of the city ? long ago abandoned, when the river that carried its commerce shifted to a new course ? is a square mile of forest, marked off by the vague perimeter of crumbled ramparts. Its streets can no longer be traced in the thick undergrowth; masses of vegetation clog the roofless viharas; silk-cotton trees thrust their tough roots like crow-bars into the brick stupas. Wildflowers spring from the cracked limbs of the mighty statues, and tendrils hang on the graceful contours of the mutilated stucco reliefs.1 (Figs. 2 and 3). The young official of the Government Arche ological Service makes his scheduled rounds, now and then bringing with him a tourist from Bangkok. Sometimes by night a clandestine treasure-hunter, having propitiated the guardi an demons with offerings, digs into an old stupa for gold. Except for such occasional intruders, the ruins are less disturbed by visitors from the modern world than haunted by memories of Brah Ruang, the half-legendary king who loved kite-flying and swimming, the master of magic and the hero of many a romantic escapade. The peasants who cultivate the fields nearby are little changed from their ancestors. They profess to "follow the religion of Buddha in all things" and at the same time they have a lively belief in demons. They still speak a very pure Siamese; and unlike the people of Bangkok they have little Chinese blood in their veins. This place was the capital of a brilliant but short-lived kingdom that flourished during part of the 13th and 14th centuries ? the focus of a culture that has moulded the character of suc cessive generations of Siamese to its gentle and tolerant Buddhism. But these ruins in the forest ? and the ruins of a dozen tributary cities ? are not the only tangible relics of the kingdom. Many bronze images of the Buddha, dating from the great period, have been removed from the ruins and brought to monasteries and museums elsewhere. Very few have found their way to Europe or America. Some are preserved in the Royal City Monastery in the modern town a few miles from Old Sukhodaya, some at Bishnuloka, Svargaloka, or Kambeng Bejra. But the greatest collections are in Bangkok ? in the National Museum, the 5</page><page sequence="2">Great Relic Monastery, the Monastery of the Fifth King, and in the palaces of three or four princes. Many other monasteries and private collectors possess a few fine pieces. Of all these images, the one that best typifies the art of Sukhodaya, with its peculiar and un earthly elegance, is a Walking Buddha in the Monastery of the Fifth King. (Figs. 4 and 5). It was formerly in the Great Relic Monastery in Bangkok; so presumably, like the rest of the images in that collection, it was rescued some what over a hundred years ago from one of the ruined cities of the Sukhodaya kingdom, per haps the old capital itself. It dates, I should think, from the 14th century. Made of fine-quality bronze, it was originally covered with a coating of lacquer and gold leaf, which later wore off and gave place to a patina. Then, perhaps two or three generations ago, the patina was scraped off and the bronze was dark ened with frequent rubbings of cocoanut oil and soot. From a distance it has the color of old mahogany; but upon closer inspection the gold en-copper color of the metal itself can here and there be seen gleaming through the artificial darkening. The statue, which is over seven feet high, represents the Buddha in a momentary pause in those Peregrinations over the face of the earth during the course of which he ex pounded the Doctrine that will free mankind from sorrow. He lifts one hand in the "gesture of Exposition/' while the other arm swings at his side. One leg is bent, with the knee slightly forward, the toe on the ground, the heel raised; the other leg is straight, with the foot planted firmly as if with the deliberate intention of imprinting its shape on the ground. Travelers from the occident, when they first see this image, are apt to be less impressed at its beauty than repelled by what seems a wilful misrepresentation of the human body. They cannot deny that the work is technically superb: the silhouette is graceful, the design rhythmic, the modeling expertly fluid; in welcome con trast to the thousands of torpid-looking images that crowd the monasteries, this figure is full of nervous energy. But the unmuscled softness of the flesh, the swelling breast and round elong ated arms, the bulbous thighs and distorted knees, the flat feet and projecting heels ?are not these things an insult to our usual ideas of male good looks? It is true that to us of the 20th century, ac customed to expressionism and abstract art, they are not quite such a shock as they were to an earlier generation of travelers who judged sculpture in terms of fidelity to nature. But if that generation, failing to notice the masterly skill of the work, set down the distortions to the sculptor's ignorance of anatomy, would we be any nearer the truth if we set them down to his inventiveness in search of aesthetic values? Was he "rejecting the human and denying the divine* ' in favor of abstract beauty, as Matisse and Picasso have recently been accused of do ing?2 As anyone at all acquainted with Buddhist art can easily see, the sculptor was doing some thing very different. He was shaping the human to conform to a certain conception of the divine. But students of Buddhist art, unless they have some special acquaintance with Siam, may well be puzzled to know exactly what that conception was. They can see that the artist was using hu man forms, or something more or less resem bling human forms, as symbols; they will rec ognize much of the vocabulary of symbol ? like the subject depicted ? as Indian. But the Bud dhas of Sukhodaya could not possibly be mis taken for products of any Indian school. A transformation has occurred, like the transform ation in literature. The old Siamese dramatists borrowed scholarly words from Sanskrit and Pali, but embedded them in Siamese syntax; they looked to the Ramayana and the Jatakas for their plots, but steeped their incidental descriptions in local color.3 In the same way the sculptor has given the old language of symbols a different cadence, and invested the great In dian Teacher with a different quality. Buddhism has meant many different things 6</page><page sequence="3">at different times and places. Immense gulfs separate the austere monasticism of the Elders from the Tantrik Buddhism of Medieval Ben gal, from Tibetan Lamaism, from the Chinese Mahayana. Though the Hinayana Buddhism of Sukhodaya was certainly a less drastic variation, it was not precisely what the Sage of the Sakyas himself had preached. In order to understand the kind of faith that inspired the art of Sukhodaya, we shall have to make a long detour into Buddhist history in other lands, and also see what can be gleaned from the written records of the old kingdom itself. But since no religion is ever quite what it says it is ? for official documents often ob scure unofficial beliefs that have great vitality ? we shall look first at the Hinayana that prevails today in Siam. Though considerable changes have taken place, it is a direct descendant of the Hinayana of Sukhodaya; and it has the advan tage of showing in living form the two main tendencies that have always shared the domina tion of Hinayana thought. The two tendencies are divergent, not to say contradictory. In modern Siam there is, on the one hand, the official Doctrine, rational and hu manistic, a "religion without a god," preached by learned monks and accepted by modern minded Buddhists. On the other hand there is the popular religion, full of superstition and magic. These two exist side by side, with mutual tolerance. For the last hundred years the highest ecclesi astical authorities have sought to strip Bud dhism of its superstitious accretions, to restore the pure Doctrine of renunciation and gentle ness taught in the fifth century B.C. by the greatest of human teachers ? the Sage of the Sakyas, the Lord Buddha. They tell us that since his words have not always been correctly handed down to the present day, the Scriptures are not necessarily infallible; but when the spurious additions and pious exaggerations have been removed, the true Doctrine emerges in all its clarity. There is nothing in it inconsistent with modern science or common sense: on the contrary, its very basis is reason. It is not faith at all; it is a philosophy, a psychological discip line, a system of ethics. The universe is gov erned by an inexorable natural law ? the law of cause and effect. No individual ? whether animal, man, or god (if gods exist) ? is perma nent. Each is a compound, a putting together, of elements such as form, matter, and mental qualities; in each individual, without any ex ception, the relation of the component parts, constantly changing, is never the same for any two consecutive moments. No sooner has sep arateness, individuality, begun, than dissolu tion, disintegration, begins too. There is no such thing as the "soul." If each individual's life is but a single link in an endless chain of transmigrations, the connection from one to another is only the continuing energy generated by deeds done; there will not be any continuity of consciousness from one birth to another. The single aim of mankind should be to abolish suf fering. Belief in God is of no importance; both ritual and prayers for divine intervention are as useless and distracting as trying to tamper with natural law by means of magic. Men must do good, not in order to reach heaven or to please God, but in order to be happy themselves and make others happy; they must refrain from evil deeds not because evil deeds are sinful but because they cause suffering to both victim and doer. By rooting out all evil from their thoughts and deeds, men can become spiritually invul nerable and need no longer dread the cycle of rebirths. Since this philosophy was not easy for simple minds to grasp, Buddha tirelessly re peated the great ethical principles: "Take joy in the joys of others, take sorrow at the sorrows of others, be indifferent to your own joys and sorrows" ? this program alone would abolish suffering. The stories of heavens and hells, of miracles and monsters, that enliven the Scrip tures and Commentaries are parables drawn from folklore, introduced only to illustrate some moral. Only the vulgar mistake them for literal fact. Only the vulgar regard Buddha as a god. He should be remembered with gratitude for 7</page><page sequence="4">the priceless gift of the Doctrine he bestowed, but he is inaccessible to any personal appeals, for he was "Totally Extinguished" when he died. Finally, though the rationalists pay a polite respect to all things associated with Bud dha ? relics of his bones and hair, cuttings and leaves from the Bo tree that sheltered him at the moment of his Enlightenment, images of him in metal and stone ? they know that these things have no intrinsic virtue but are merely reminders of the Doctrine.4 But how different are the beliefs of the masses! They have a deep faith in ritual and magic, they are simple animists at heart. They propitiate a host of divinities and demons in order to get help in facing the everyday problems of exist ence ? finding money, warding off accident and disease, softening the heart of the beloved. While the higher divinities are rather grand and remote, the demons are everywhere. They are more like the demons of classic Mediter ranean mythology than the devils of Christian ity. Though they are touchy, they are not necessarily evil; some are good-hearted protec tors, some are mischievous imps. They are not immortal, nor are they disembodied spirits; but their bodies are peculiar, changeable, and sel dom seen. Any big tree or rock, any hilltop or building, any stream or cloud, is likely to have its own particular demon. They protect pri vate property and villages; they cause rain or drought, good crops or bad, success or failure in love and gambling and warfare. While their malice is easy to incur and hard to escape, they can be placated with offerings of food and flow ers or coerced with spells. Buddha is a god above all other gods; if he is too important to be troubled with every-day matters, he must still be worshiped in order to take care of the future life. Simple people who cannot distinguish be tween energy and consciousness are apt to think a personal soul transmigrates from one existence to another; and the net balance of good and evil deeds done in any one life will govern the cir cumstances of rebirth in the next. The chain of transmigrations will go on endlessly; the crea ture who is an animal today may be promoted for good actions to be reborn as a prince in some future life, while today's divinity, careless of the future, may be reborn as a pauper's child or a cripple. In their desire to store up a credit balance that will entitle them to a fortunate rebirth, people sometimes neglect the major virtues in favor of multiplying easier "acts of merit," such as worshiping holy relics, planting Bo trees, and causing Buddha images to be made. And these objects in themselves have a definite prophylactic value.5 Perhaps in the monkhood of every Hinayana country there has always been a group, no mat ter how small, of learned philosophers who understood the Doctrine in the first sense, who believed that heaven and hell exist only in men's hearts, who took the fables for mere illus trations. But the monkhood has its roots in the people. Almost every young man in Siam when he turns twenty dons the Yellow Robe of the Order for at least three months to get some basic religious instruction. The monks ? both those who stay in the Order only a short time and those who stay in it all their lives ? come from every social class. In any such cross-section of the population it would not be surprising if the ignorant and superstitious outnumbered the wise. Before the reforms of the last hundred years, the official Buddhism of Siam was much closer to the popular religion of today. But still, it was not quite the same thing. It may have been just as superstitious, but it was more scholarly. Rationalism had still at least a few adherents in the 17th century, as we know from the memoirs of the French missionaries to Ayudhya, who, in spite of their professional hostility to Buddhism, give some very lucid accounts of the Doctrine as it was expounded to them by the yellow-robed "Talapoins." If there were some rationalist philosophers at Ayudhya then, may there not have been some at Sukhodaya three or four centuries before? 8</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 1.

The Historical Background The Pali Scriptures are supposed to have been handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation until they were put in writing in the first century B.C. Some parts of them have the ring of truth, as though they preserved the Buddha's own words intact. Other parts must have been composed much later. These Scriptures already reveal the two di vergent tendencies that can be seen in modern Siam.6 Both are present throughout the long enormous growth of Buddhism in its spread from India to other lands. Even in Mahayana, which created such an elaborate mystical sys tem, rationalism ? though submerged ? is never completely suppressed. Even in Hinayana, which strove so earnestly to preserve the pure Doctrine, superstition made vast inroads. Yet if neither kind of thinking ever finally triumphed, and if the two were basically irreconcilable, they were not necessarily in open conflict. On one hand, the rationalist could accept as metaphor and parable the most fantastic inventions of the pious; tolerance was a cardinal point of his own code; and if popular Buddhism seemed to him far from perfect it was nevertheless better than none at all. On the other hand the mystic could read transcendental meanings into the most prosaic records, while the superstitious could pick up a few words from the Scriptures, use them out of context, and turn them into spells. A great deal of Buddhist art is a compromise between the two points of view ? or, rather, an embodiment of both, to be taken by the ob server according to his own needs. The ration alist point of view does not lend itself to direct plastic treatment; while words can explain it exactly, sculpture can explain it only by the use of metaphoric symbol. So there is always the risk that the symbol will be taken literally. The more closely the symbol resembles human forms, the greater the risk. Perhaps it was for this reason that the early Indian sculptors refrained absolutely from por traying Buddha in human form.7 In bas-reliefs picturing the story of his life, though they de picted all the other actors in the different scenes with considerable fidelity to nature, they indi cated his presence only by a symbol ? such as a riderless horse, a Bo tree sheltering an invisible Being, a vacant throne, a pair of footprints marked with the Wheel emblem. In some of the Amaravati reliefs, worshipers bow down before a Pillar of Fire ? a tall post striped with diag onal jets of flame ? whose identity is made clear by the pair of Wheel-marked footprints be neath.8 It is the Great Sage expressed as that "fiery energy" which, after sustaining him through the ordeals that preceded his Enlight enment, later enabled him to perform miracles, subdue ferocious monsters, and teach mankind how to escape from sorrow. But such impersonal symbols could not suf fice forever. After a time men's impulse toward personal worship could no longer be refused; their need for a manifest deity became over powering. Still, no deity endowed with merely human beauty could serve the purpose. When the Greco-Buddhist sculptors of Gandhara fell into the solecism of making just such an at tempt, their colleagues at Mathura, long accus tomed to thinking in terms of the old aniconic symbols, soon set them right. In the course of time an eminently suitable type of Buddha image was evolved. It was part human and part symbol; or, to put it differently, its "super natural anatomy" plainly announced that it signified an Ideal Being who is above and be yond the forms of the visible world. In the aesthetic sense no less than the relig ious, the supernatural anatomy was a necessary and inevitable development. The historical fact that it was based on a series of absurd mis undertsandings is of no real importance. (Every language has wTords whose meanings, though based on a false etymology, have been estab lished through long usage). Nevertheless, the story is curious enough to be worth repeating. When the Indian sculptors tried to form a 9</page><page sequence="18">mental picture of the great Sage who had been Totally Extinguished so many hundred years before, it was naturally influenced not only by the earliest statuary of Gandhara and Mathura, but also by whatever relevant passages they could remember from the Scriptures. They re called, even if they did not clearly understand, the cryptic list of Thirty-Two Marks which dis tinguished him at birth, and which enabled the Brahmin soothsayers to prophesy his sublime destiny. In reality, as modern scholarship has proved, this list, together with the supporting list of Eighty Lesser Marks, was nothing but an old device used in days when writing was rare, a memorandum to help diviners who told the fortunes of newborn children by means of their bodily conformation. In their systematic in spection of the child, the diviners were looking not only for lucky signs but also for evidence of sound physical structure, good health, and beauty. In part, therefore, the memorandum was like a palmist's chart; in part it was like a schedule of conformation such as the judges at a horse-show use to rate the competing animals. Among the lucky signs, the hairs on the body should curl clockwise, and the network of lines on palms and footsoles should be in the form of a Wheel. To the sculptors the information about the body hairs was of no use, but they could easily incise Wheels in a neat pattern in the proper places. Among the signs of sound struc ture were a well-rounded skull, long strong arms, and so on; among the signs of health, a glowing skin; among the signs of beauty, eye brows that met over the bridge of the nose. But when such signs as these attached themselves to the sculptor's mental picture of Buddha, al ready partly conditioned by the early statuary of Gandhara and Mathura, there were some odd results. In the first Gandhara images the hair had been arranged in graceful waves at the side of the head and bound into a toplock above, while the Mathura images had it twisted into a spiral topknot. Presently both schools reverted to a formula that Indian sculptors had often used before for the minor deities; they covered the skull with separate spiral curls. For some rea son they covered the topknot with curls too. From this point on, the sculptors and the Com mentators led each other into further and fur ther marvels. The Scriptures had recorded the Marks in very condensed language ? for after all they were only quoting a memorandum whose meaning had been quite clear to the diviners. But by this time the original meaning was no longer so clear. What, the Commenta tors might well ask themselves, was a "turban head?" If at first it had meant merely a well rounded skull, they now took a hint from the statues they saw and explained it as a super natural "rounded protuberance" ? the "ush nisha" ? on top of the skull. The propriety of the spiral curls seemed to be confirmed by ana logy with the "clockwise-turning body-hairs." From the very beginning, the images had had long ear-lobes ? a touch of realism, since the great Sage had formerly been a prince and worn heavy earrings; now they were related to an item in the list of Eighty Lesser Marks. Since statues were regularly gilded, the "glowing skin" was "skin shining like gold." Influenced by ac counts of Buddha's fiery energy, the junction of eyebrows over the bridge of the nose was transformed into a "tuft of luminous down" in the forehead. And so on with the rest of the catalogue.9 In the later Amaravati reliefs, Buddha is usually a human being equipped with some, if not all, of the supernatural anatomy. But the old tradition still persists too. He is sometimes still a Pillar of Fire just as before. Now and then he is "the Buddha all aflame" ? an anthro pomorphic Pillar of Fire, a man with tongues of flame thrusting out from his body.10 But more often the flames have been reduced to a lumi nous disk like a halo around his whole figure or his head alone. The artists of the Gupta period, with their poetic imagination and their consummate skill, established a standard. The supernatural ana tomy, though never crudely conspicuous, is 10</page><page sequence="19">essential to it, and visible enough to anyone preoccupied with such matters. This standard long dominated Buddhist art. Through its imi tations and adaptations it influenced the Pali Commentators in Ceylon when they came to annotate the passages dealing with the Marks. What they saw, they exaggerated ? and then confirmed by means of philological gymnastics. When the commentarial work was finished there emerged a catalogue, purporting to de scribe the Buddha's appearance, which reads ? to us at least ? like sheer madness. # # # Long before this time, a huge area to the east had come within the cultural orbit of India. Successive waves of Indian influence, growing more intense during the Gupta period, grad ually transformed the Southeast Asia Peninsula and the Archipelago. The peoples who lived there, though by no means so advanced as the Indians, already had a certain culture which was not altogether primitive. The Indians did not destroy this culture ? they impregnated it with their own, deeply in some places, lightly in others. Trading-posts set up by Indian mer chants grew into kingdoms. Buddhist mission aries and learned Brahmins arrived. The ruling classes, descended from marriages between In dians and the daughters of local chieftains, adopted Sanskrit as their scholarly language, copied the techniques and statecraft of India, and worshipped Buddha or the Hindu gods. But most of the people, if not all, retained an unshakeable belief in the local demons. The land had been conquered by a culture, not by an invading army. The Indianized king doms of Southeast Asia were not colonies; they had no political ties with the mother country. Although from time to time they acknowledged some sort of suzerainty to China, they were for most practical purposes independent. Except for the northeastern corner of the Peninsula ? Tonkin and part of Annam -? which the Chi nese conquered by force of arms, the Middle Kingdom exercised little cultural influence. All the rest of the Peninsula ? Burma, Malaya, Siam, Cambodia, Laos ? unceasingly justified its nickname "Further India." u # # # The region that is now called Siam or Thai land was peopled by a mixture of races, of whom the most important were Mon and Khmer. The Thai, ancestors of the modern Siamese, had not yet arrived on the scene. Among the earliest works of art discovered in Siam are some bronze statuettes of Buddha, in Amaravati style ? probably imported from India or Ceylon.12 There is not much proof that statu ary was being made locally until the 6th or 7 th century, but from that time on the evidences become fairly abundant. The rich plains of central Siam, not far from the Gulf, were the seat of the Mon kingdom of Dvaravati. Its religion was Hinayana, and its sculpture consisted principally of Buddha im ages. The best of these, carved in hard limestone, are expressions of simple dignity, youthful but timeless, and lacking neither in grace nor in finish. (Figs. 6 and 7). They seem too good to be the work of inexperienced sculptors; and yet they differ too much from the Gupta or Post Gupta models of India, which obviously in spired them, to be easily mistaken for the work of Indian artists. Though they are not "realistic" in the western sense, they seem less abstract than their Indian prototypes; they have more of hu man individuality. The Gupta artists had con ceived the Buddha as an ideal Being who is above and beyond the forms of the ordinary world; but the Mon artists, less expert in trans cendental imagination, seem rather to picture him as a human being who has assumed some of the attributes of that ideal without being wholly transformed by it. Such features of the super natural anatomy as he possesses ? ushnisha, spiral curls, long ear-lobes, Wheel on palm and footsole ? look less like essential elements in the structure than insignia attached to a partly idealized human body. Like the Indian proto types, he wears a stylized monastic robe, which clings to the body without a wrinkle, as if water soaked; where it falls free, the silhouette and a 11</page><page sequence="20">few schematic folds explain the hang. The rep ertoire of posture is very limited. The Buddha stands or sits; and with one or both hands he performs some simple gesture whose meaning has already become established in Indian tra dition.13 The Dvaravati artists were at their best in the use of stone and stucco; in bronze they were less skillful. In whatever material they worked, they owed much to Indian example. If they invented no new iconography, they selected; they did not take over the conventions of any one Indian school wholesale. In style, from the very beginning, they were more independent than in iconography. Their originality, though limited, is visible enough in such subjective matters, evident but imponderable, as facial features and quality of modeling; and it can be traced in other matters, less conspicuous but more precisely measurable, such as small dif ferences in the treatment of drapery. The modeling, like the anatomy, in general follows the Gupta and Post-Gupta idiom as seen in the schools of Mathura, Sarnath, and Ajanta. If it is less subtle, less soft, less flexible, it is simpler and more forthright. The body proportions, as well as some details of posture, are often more like Amaravati. In the modeling of the face, though there are reminiscences of various Indian schools, there are some novelties. The heavy eyebrows, the prominent eyes, the thick lips, are unlike Gupta features; perhaps they are inspired by Mon physiognomy. Most surprising of all, the silhouette of the lips is often accented by means of incised outline. This convention ? which looks like a left-over from some earlier technique of making incised draw ings on stone ? was unknown in Indian statuary but became popular in Cambodia and almost universal in the later art of Siam. Dvaravati art must have fixed in the minds of the people a certain ideal of what a Buddha image should be. Throughout succeeding gen erations, all the way up to the present time, it has influenced, no matter how remotely, the image-makers' conception. There were plenty of other influences later, but they never quite obliterated the ancient ideal. It is this basic factor, preserving some relic of the Gupta style as interpreted by the Mon artists, that makes the Buddhas of Siam, of whatever period, dis tinctive from those of all other countries. The Khmer, who had built a mighty empire in Cambodia, annexed Dvaravati a little after the year 1000. For the next 250 years the depu ties of the Kings of Angkor ruled central Siam from their viceregal seat at Lopburi. The aristocratic civilization of Cambodia was dominated by monarchs who claimed to be the human incarnations of one or another deity of the Hindu and the Mahayana pantheons. Whereas Dvaravati art was simple and direct, Cambodian was exceedingly complex and re sourceful. Drawing its original inspiration from India, it had soon developed a characteristic style of its own. The Khmer image-makers, at their best, were superb technicians, as skillful in using bronze as in carving stone. As might be expected, they were chiefly concerned with mak ing images of Vishnu, Siva, Lokesvara and the other deities of the official religions. They decked them out in the "royal attire," with crowns and earrings, necklaces and bracelets. Often they used the same "royal attire" for Buddha, obscuring his supernatural anatomy in a profusion of ornament. Even when they por trayed him in monastic dress ? which they sometimes misrepresented ? they tended to dis guise the supernatural anatomy. But the Dvara vati ideal, though long obscured, re-emerged at Angkor Thorn itself in the "Bayon style" at the end of the 12th century. In Siam, all during the Cambodian occupation many people continued to worship Buddha according to the Hinayana doctrine; Buddha images in the Mon tradition were still being made, although more or less contaminated with influences from the style of the conquerors.14 # # # In the 13 th century the Eurasian continent from Poland to Manchuria was staggering under 12</page><page sequence="21">the blows of the Mongol conquerors. Before his death in 1227 Genghis Khan had made himself master of all China north of the Yellow River and created an empire that stretched the entire breadth of Asia. Under his successors the terrible momentum continued. The Golden Horde swept through Russia, attacked Hungary, destroyed the Cali phate of Baghdad. Kublai Khan crushed the Sung kingdom; by 1279 he was Emperor of the whole of China, while the rule of his vassals reached to Poland and Arabia. He was the sovereign of a greater population than any man before him had ever been. The splendor of his court at Peking, where he perpetuated the cul ture of the conquered Sungs, fascinated the Venetian Marco Polo. In the Southeast Asia Peninsula the Mongol armies won no spectacular victories; but their vast successes elsewhere set off a chain reaction that completely upset the old political pattern. The Khmer, who had so long dominated central Siam, were soon to lose their hegemony to an other people ? the Thai. The remote origins of the Thai are rather obscure. But they had long been settled in an independent kingdom in Yunnan, where ? though their Chinese neighbors regarded them as "barbarians" ? they had developed a con siderable culture. They were brave soldiers and good organizers, quick learners and clever as similators. For a very long time Thai emigrants had been drifting down from Yunnan into Southeast Asia. These early emigrants, perhaps for the most part adventurers, landless peasants and fugitive slaves, were not individuals of a very high type. The proud rulers of Cambodia scarcely noticed them, except to enlist a few of their contingents for military service. A Khmer artist, picturing this "savage" soldiery in a bas-relief a little after 1150, seemed to be taking malicious pleas ure in exaggerating its outlandish appearance and equipment (Fig. 8). Less than a century later, the Khmer learned better. One of the most distant outposts of their empire was at Svargaloka, four hundred miles away from Angkor. Even before the Mongol conquests, political troubles in Yunnan had impelled more of the Thai to leave their home land ? among them, probably some members of the upper classes. They were carving out petty states for themselves in the wildernesses of northern Siam and the neighboring regions, and had infiltrated communities farther south. Thai lords ruled the countryside around Svar galoka under Khmer vassalage. One of these lords, whose loyalty the Khmer had tried to se cure by honoring him with a high title and giv ing him a Cambodian princess in marriage, suddenly revolted. With the aid of a neighbor ing Thai chieftain he seized Svargaloka and its twin city Sukhodaya after a brief battle against the Khmer garrisons. He proclaimed the prov ince an independent kingdom, but instead of assuming its crown himself he conferred it on his ally, at the same time seeking to legitimize the act by giving him his own title "Sri Indra ditya" which he had received from the Khmer.15 This Sri Indraditya, the first King of Sukho daya and founder of the "Brah Ruang" dynasty, rapidly consolidated the power of the new king dom. When the Mongols took Yunnan in 1253, more Thai emigrants poured southward, and many of them rallied to his banners. By the end of the century, his son Rama Gamheng (who is also known as Brah Ruang) ruled most of the territories that compose the present kingdom of Siam ? except the northern provinces, which were ruled by other Thai princes who were his allies. Rama Gamheng was not only King of Sukhodaya ("Origin of Hap piness") and Svargaloka ("Paradise"), directly controlling such towns as Bishnuloka ("Domain of Vishnu") and Kambeng Bejra ("Wall of Diamonds"), but was also lord of a score of cities stretching from the northeast beyond the Mekhong to Lower Burma and the Malay Pe ninsula.16 He carried his victorious arms to the gates of the Khmer capital; writing a report in 1296, a Chinese who accompanied the Mongol envoy to the Court of Angkor declares: "In the 13</page><page sequence="22">recent war against the Siamese, the whole Khmer people had to fight, and their country has been completely devastated."17 King Rama Gamheng was on friendly terms with the Mongols. He acknowledged their su zerainty and sent tribute to the Court of Peking. But in spite of this formality he was for all practical purposes an independent monarch. The Mongols, preoccupied with other matters, were not sorry to have a buffer state between their Yunnanese possessions and Cambodia. King Rama Gamheng is the author of a fa mous inscription, which is the oldest known writing in Siamese. Composed in 1292, it il lustrates the character of the Thai: they are straightforward people, brave in war, generous in victory; they have absorbed some of the mili tary science of their Mongol neighbors and their stern sense of duty. The King, writing in aus terely simple prose, says: "When I was nineteen years old, the chief of a neighboring state made war on my father. His soldiers made a mass charge, and my father's men fled in confusion. I did not flee. I mounted an elephant and pushed him in front of my father. I engaged the enemy chief in a duel; I struck his elephant and wound ed it, and the chief took flight... In my father's lifetime, I served my father and my mother. If I caught game or fish, I took it to my father; if I got a piece of fruit, acid or sweet, fragrant and pleasant, I took it to my father. If I attacked a village or town and captured elephants, boys, girls, silver or gold, I brought them to my father. When my father died, my elder brother still lived. I served my elder brother as I had served my father. When my elder brother died, the whole kingdom became mine."18 The Thai quickly absorbed a great deal of the old sophisticated civilization of the Khmer. They ingeniously forced the Khmer alphabet to do service for their own tonal language for which it was never intended; they incorporated Khmer words in their speech. They imitated Khmer hydraulic engineering and architecture. They borrowed large sections of the Khmer ad ministrative and social structure. They gained access through the Khmer to the rich treasury of Indian literature. Installing erudite Brahmins as teachers at their Court, they studied the Vedas, the great epic poems, the technical trea tises on law and politics, astrology and medi cine.19 They applied themselves with such zeal that Sukhodaya became a great center of learn ing ?- greater, if we can believe their boasts, than Angkor itself.20 * # # The religion of the first Thai who settled in Siam must have been chiefly a matter of propi tiating demons, though they may have brought with them from Yunnan some recollection of Mahayana Buddhism. But by Rama Gamheng's time, if not before, they had become devout adherents of the Hinayana. "The King of this City of Sukhodaya," he writes in another part of his inscription, "as well as the princes and princesses, the men as well as the women, the nobles and the chiefs, all without exception, without distinction of rank or sex, are devoted to the religion of the Buddha." The King has built splendid monasteries in the city and its environs; he has presented one of them to the venerable patriarch "who has studied the Scrip tures from end to end, who is more learned than all the other monks in the country, and who has come here from Nagara Sridharma raja." The King delights in charity and alms giving; every year he bestows the Kathin robes and magnificent gifts upon the monks in a cere mony accompanied by music and rejoicing; he venerates holy relics. But his devotion to Bud dhism has not erased his belief in the tutelary demons; on a certain hill, he says, there dwells "the divine demon of the hill, superior to all the other demons of the country. If any prince who is lord of this City of Sukhodaya does prop er obeisance to him and gives him the ritual offerings, then the country is sound and pros perous; but if the prescribed obeisance is neg lected, if the ritual offerings are not given, then the demon of the hill will no longer protect this country and it will fall upon evil days."21 The Hinayana ? with its noble mortality 14</page><page sequence="23">and its sturdy common sense, oddly associated with tolerance of animism and magic ? was much better calculated to appeal to a young, vigorous and simple people than the aristocratic religions of Cambodia. The Thai must have learned it not from the Khmer, but from that other important group among their neighbors and subjects ? the Mon, who had held to it ever since the days of the Dvaravati kingdom.22 By this time the Sanskrit cultures of the old Indianized kingdoms of Southeast Asia were in decadence. There were no more waves of strong influence from India itself, which had been largely overrun by Muslim invaders. Buddhism had long ago been eaten up and absorbed by the Hindu religions in the land of its birth. But it flourished in the island of Ceylon, where the Sinhalese, after freeing themselves from the Tamils, preserved the Hinayana Doctrine. Cey lon was its stronghold and fountainhead, where generation after generation of monks studied the Pali Scriptures and multiplied the commen tarial literature. Sinhalese Buddhism had been introduced ? or rather re-introduced ? into Burma as early as the 11th century, and was certainly known to the Mon. The Thai were soon seeking direct contact with the Sinhalese fountainhead. Nagara Sri dharmaraja in the Malay Peninsula was a natural port of call for ships plying between Ceylon and Siam; if tradition may be believed, Brah Ruang himself went there to receive a specially revered image of Buddha sent by the Sinhalese King.23 Since the place was also probably a center of Hinayana Buddhism of Sinhalese type it is not surprising that Rama Gamheng should have invited the "venerable patriarch" to come from there and settle at Sukhodaya. Rama Gamheng's successors invited learned monks to come from Lower Burma and Ceylon; they heaped honors upon them and built monasteries for their ac commodation. Monks went from Sukhodaya to study in the lovely island, and when they re turned they brought with them copies of the Pali Scriptures and Commentaries and holy relics. They also brought cuttings from the great Bo tree at Anuradhapura, which was fraught with special sanctity, for it had been grown from a cutting taken long ago from the even more famous tree at Bodhgaya that sheltered the Sage of the Sakyas at the supreme moment of En lightenment. # # # What was the quality of this devotion to Bud dhism among the ruling classes and the monks at Sukhodaya? Of its intensity there can be no doubt ? but of its purity we cannot be so sure. Was it more like the rationalism that is orthodox in modern Siam, or more like the popular religion? Though there must have been at least a few rationalists, they have left no record. The Kings were far from agreeing with today's Buddhists who assert that the Founder of the Doctrine sternly condemned magic and superstition. It was an age of miracles. Even its errors and follies, as a materialist would call them, were transformed by faith into poetic beauties. The sons and grandsons of the warlike Rama Gam heng, laying down their arms, turned more and more to religion. An inscription composed by King Rama Gamheng's son and successor gives a vivid pic ture of the change that has taken place. The royal author tells the story of his own brother, who in youth had been a dashing warrior, vic torious in many battles and elephant duels. "When he put on the royal attire, he was as beautiful as the god Vishnu. . . . He studied the qualities of elephants and the qualities of horses; he knew the principal and accessory sciences. ... Now doing good, now evil, laughing or shed ding tears, winning or losing, in good fortune or in bad, he moved about, came and went, with unquiet heart." At the age of thirty he was over whelmed with grief at the death of his son. "Then he understood that this world of trans migrations is unstable, ephemeral, illusory. He put away his weapons and quitted his palace. . . . He wished to perform great acts of merit so that he might at last attain Enlightenment in the shelter of a sacred Bo tree." In imitation of 15</page><page sequence="24">that Prince Vessantara who was the penultimate incarnation of the Sage of the Sakyas, he de termined to practise the perfection of liberality. "He built a pavilion of cloth, red and yellow, black and green. He made his daughters dress in their loveliest finery, with golden bracelets and many rings. He made them offer themselves to those who came and asked for them ..." He gave away all his possessions, assumed the Yel low Robe, and went on a long pilgrimage to India and Ceylon in search of holy relics and cuttings of the Bo tree. Upon his return to Suk hodaya he planted the cuttings in the ground. "Then he uttered this wish: // it is true that I am destined ever to attain Enlightenment, may at least one of these trees live, rise up, and put forth buds. No sooner had he spoken than one of the dry leaves turned green; the tree straight ened up and grew." The relics, miraculously springing out of the stupa where the King had enshrined them, rose into the air shining like gold. The chief relic put forth rays of six colors. When the people, after worshiping it for a sufficient time, invited it to re-enter the stupa, it would not do so. "But I," writes the King, "was full of faith. I threw myself on the ground, offering my life in dedication, vowing to prac tise the religion of Ceylon and to follow the Buddha's words in all things. Then the relic came down and made the circuit of the golden sanctuary, emitting brilliant rays like the spokes of a chariot wheel. It entered the golden urn, and the crowd of other relics returned to the sanctuary like bees hurrying back to their beehive."24 3. Rise of the Sukhodaya Style "In the midst of this City of Sukhodaya," wrote King Rama Gamheng in 1292, "there are images of the Lord Buddha. Some of them are of bronze. There are some images eighteen cubits high; there are some of large size; there are some of medium size."25 His successors again and again record their pious satisfaction at having beautiful images made. And many lesser patrons, who have left no inscriptions, must have followed the royal example, ordering images of Buddha, large or small, to be made in whatever material their means would allow. The images vary in size from inch-tall minia tures to huge giants thirty feet high, and the sculptors varied their materials accordingly. For statuettes they often used gold or silver, for small votive tablets they used lead or terra cotta; for medium-sized statues they regularly used bronze; for reliefs they used stucco; for colossal statues they built a core of lat?rite blocks or brick, which they coated with stucco or overlaid with bronze plates. Unlike the Mon and the Khmer, the Thai image-makers seldom carved in stone.26 More than anything else bronze was their favorite material, and in it they achieved their greatest triumphs. The bronze tradition they established was unprecedented in the In dianized east. Indian, Javanese, and Khmer metalworkers had made some figures of life size or larger, but not many. When occasionally the Burmese attempted it, the results were disas trous; the Dvaravati metalworkers had never ventured beyond the statuette size. But the scale and abundance of the Sukhodaya bronzes are as remarkable as the dexterity and assurance of the work. Their bronze is of fine quality. The propor tions of its component metals vary a good deal: copper predominates, with lesser amounts of tin and other metals; gold and silver have some times been added to the alloy. It is cast by the cire perdue process, which appears to have varied little from ancient times in India up to the present day in Siam. Since the making of bronze Buddhas is still a flourishing industry, any visitor to Bangkok can observe the various stages in the process and get a good idea of the methods used in old Sukhodaya. When the artist has determined the precise 16</page><page sequence="25">form he wishes the image to assume, he makes a clay model, a trifle smaller than the finished work will be ? for this clay model will become the core of the statue. After it dries he coats it with wax, in which he adds the final details. Around this he builds up the mould by patting on a mixture of sand, clay, and some adhesive material. Having dried out the whole thing in the sun, he puts it on a hearth to bake. The wax melts out; the clay of the core inside and of the mould outside are transformed to terra cotta. While they are still hot, the molten metal is poured in, filling the entire space vacated by the wax. After cooling, the mould is broken off and the bronze image emerges. The bronze, therefore, is only a layer ? thick or thin de pending on the thickness of the layer of wax ? covering the terra cotta core. This core will usually be allowed to remain permanently as a reinforcement. After the irregularities have been filed off and the bronze rubbed smooth, the image is covered with lacquer and gold leaf. Most Sukhodaya bronzes, in the course of centuries, have lost their gilding. Some, espe cially if they have been long buried under ground, take on a beautiful patina, which varies in color. Most often it is sage-green, perhaps streaked with sapphire blue, mottled with Vene tian red, flecked with brown or yellow ? so that if looked at through a powerful glass it has all the sparkle of an autumn forest. In recent years Siamese connoisseurs have learned to prize such variegations. But it was not always so; in earlier generations when patinated bronzes were dis covered they were usually scraped clean and regilded. To the westerner these gleaming sur faces detract from the sculptural quality; the eye is too dazzled to perceive the subtleties of modeling or even the basic elements of plastic structure. Bronzes that have lost their gilding, and especially those that have taken on a patina, are much more satisfying aesthetically. Why was the gilding, which is so disconcerting to us, deemed so necessary? Most likely few patrons or artists looked beyond the immediate answer: it was part of the supernatural anatomy. But as will be apparent later, there were more basic reasons?though perhaps they passed unnoticed. # # # While it is easy enough to determine the processes used for bronze-casting, it is much more difficult for us to grasp the quality of imaginative effort that went into making the original clay model. Yet it was that effort that constitutes the Sukhodaya artists' great achieve ment. The perfection of their bronze technique is remarkable enough ?but, after all, the Khmer and the Indians had made some fine bronzes too. Even more than the execution it is the conception that is extraordinary. The rise of the Sukhodaya style represents nothing less than an artistic revolution, as speedy and as thorough as any revolution in Buddhist art has ever been ? excepting only that ancient revolution in which aniconic symbols gave way to the "an thropomorphic" image. How can such a revolution be explained? If it had taken place in modern times, we should probably attribute it to the individual initiative of some outstanding artist or group of artists. But in a traditional religious art, as even the most casual student knows, such an explanation is impossible. Unfortunately the available data are scanty. We cannot chart the course of the artistic revo lution, illustrating its progress with successive examples of sculpture. For there is hardly one image we can date with certainty.27 Of the sev eral recognizable subdivisions of the Sukhodaya style, we can indeed identify two as being late; but of the others we cannot be sure which came first or how they succeeded one another. We can guess that the "high classic" more or less coin cided with Sukhodaya's prosperity and political greatness; but we cannot tell how long the artists had been working towards it before they succeeded in establishing it as an ideal. We know very little about the artists them selves. They are totally neglected in the inscrip tions which are so loquacious on other matters, and they are not much better treated in the tra ditional histories. We do not know the name of 17</page><page sequence="26">a single one of them, or any biographical fact.28 It is clear that they were not regarded as "artists" at all: they were craftsmen working for a patron. By analogy with ancient India on the one hand and with 19th century Siam on the other, we may guess that the craft was largely hereditary; that the young craftsman usually learned from his father, and therefore followed his instruc tions in the art with the reverent and unques tioning docility that a parent and Guru was entitled to. There must have been much more incentive to conservatism than to invention. How then did the artistic revolution take place? The patron must have been partly respon sible. The patron not only specified the weight and composition of the metal to be used, the thinness or thickness of the bronze with relation to the clay core, and consequently the dimen sions of the finished work: it was the patron also who decided on the attitude and gesture to be represented, as well as any other matters he chose. Unlike the craftsmen, some of the patrons have left enough mark in history to let us glimpse their psychology. The great quantity of fine statuary that survives today testifies to their zeal. Why had they such a passion for producing images? Certainly not because of a mere love of art ? though they must have been sensitive to beauty, they were not primarily in terested in it. They had much more practical motives. As the inscriptions tell us, the patrons were "mak ing merit" ? in order to guarantee rebirth in happy circumstances. Moreover, as the tradi tional histories admit, they were making strong magic for immediate use in this life. It was the patron, not the craftsman, who received credit for the "meritorious deed" of producing an image; it was also the patron who would have the benefit of its miraculous virtues. A great many patrons, if not all, were less interested in the merit to be stored up for the future than in the magic to be made available promptly. Buddha images are not inanimate decorative objects. They are living beings, endowed with some fraction, large or small, of the infinite power possessed by the Sage of the Sakyas. As a matter of course, every new image has been treated with a special rite to animate it and give it just such power.29 But not all images possess it in the same degree; only a few manifest it un failingly. These few have become famous by warding off human enemies and wicked demons, by protecting cities and winning battles, by call ing down the life-giving rain to assure good crops. The prince who succeeds, by diplomacy or warfare, in getting hold of one of these choice objects can feel confident that his state will be safe and prosperous. But the prince who fails to get one ? or the humbler man who has not even the means to try ? can do the next best thing: he can have a replica made.30 Talismans in general, if they are to be effec tive, must have some essential relationship to the original source of the magic. That is why holy relics of the Buddha's body are so desirable; that is why the leaves and bark of the Bo tree that sheltered him are so potent; that is why the innumerable descendants of that tree pre serve some of the virtue of the original. And that is why all Buddha images are supposed to be replicas, direct or remote, of some authentic likeness of him made by an artist, human or divine, who had known him personally.31 This fact has been a further incentive to con servatism in image-making throughout the cen turies. (Even the artistic revolution of Sukho daya, for reasons I shall explain below, did not really violate this principle). In theory, every Buddha image ever made is a copy of one of those original likenesses, or a copy of a copy. What we should call plagiarism was in the minds of the patrons an indispensable virtue; what we should call originality, an accident. Usually, perhaps, the Sukhodaya patron speci fied a model for the sculptor to copy. But how could he be certain that the model he chose was itself a genuine copy, no matter how remote, of one of those authentic likenesses? There was one sure test: if it had already displayed a high 18</page><page sequence="27">degree of magic power, it must be genuine. The choice, therefore, was necessarily limited to those few statues whose performance had been outstanding. This very performance had of course made these few statues famous, and guaranteed them the place of greatest honor in the community. The great majority of Sukhodaya images, therefore, are undoubtedly copies of the most famous cult statues in the kingdom. Some of these famous models can be identified today ? but not the earliest ones. Yet it must have been the earliest examples of the Sukhodaya style that established the type. After they had been made and installed, worshipped and observed to perform miracles, they were copied over and over again. But how were these first ones made? If they themselves are copies of something else, how could the artistic revolution possibly have taken place? How was the Sukhodaya type in vented? It is not ? like so much of the art of Southeast Asia ? the result of a long slow evolution; nor is it ? like the work of the Khmer schools in Siam ? simply an imitation of some foreign model. Yet it is certainly an imitation of some thing, though archeologists have sought in vain for the type it intended to imitate.32 The dilem ma can be solved only by recognizing what the patrons meant by "imitation." While an imitation must somehow embody the "essence" of the original, it did not have to bear a close resemblance to it ? any more than we should think the second edition of a book must be printed in the same format as the first. The "essence" could be embodied in various ways. For instance, a prince who wished to em body his own essence in an image might con tribute exactly his own weight of gold to the alloy, and have the height of the statue made equal to his own ? though there was no special effort made to imitate his personal appearance.33 By a similar process of reasoning, since Buddha's height was supposed to have been eighteen cubits (about nine metres or thirty feet), statues of him were quite often made in exactly that size.34 But not all images could be made to such gigantic dimensions. Another way to embody the essence was to seal holy relics inside the image ? but genuine relics were rare and hard to get. The standard way of embodying the essence was to make sure the iconography was correct.35 So important was this that a lay patron, unwill ing to trust either his own judgment or the sculptor's, would sometimes ask an erudite abbot to supervise it.36 But all those subtleties of modeling and facial expression which go to make up "style" were of far less moment; they might safely be left to the sculptor. A Sukhodaya image, then, is always an "im itation" of some other image ? but this may mean anything ranging from a direct facsimile to an imaginative adaptation that preserves the essence by means of the iconography without any attempt to preserve the appearance of the original. The facsimiles were no doubt the most numerous, because they were not only more likely to suit the ordinary patron but also easier to make. The sculptor could even use mechani cal aids, such as a system of plumb lines hanging from a horizontal frame to control the propor tions.37 But such facsimiles are not necessarily the lifeless things we associate with the idea of copying in the occident. In traditional art they might have plenty of vitality; after all, the plumb lines did not control the quality of the modeling. But among the image-makers were some men ? perhaps only a few ? who richly deserve to be called artists, even if our reasons for thinking so would have surprised them. The first ones who created the Sukhodaya style ? although we cannot identify their work ? were ipso facto bold innovators ... in those things that seemed to them least important. And some of their suc cessors, though less bold, were perhaps more subtly imaginative. # # # How did such artists as these go about their work? Although in theory the clay model they made 19</page><page sequence="28">was a copy of some existing statue, it was really a copy of a "memory picture." The Indian artists ? and their imitators throughout the east ? were taught to study their subject and understand it thoroughly, rather than to make a mere reproduction of its ex ternal and arbitrary appearance. The painter who wanted to picture a tree, for example, might study that tree day after day, from one angle and another, in shifting lights and dif ferent weather conditions, until it became fixed in his sensuous and intellectual experience. But he would go away from the tree when he was ready to take up the brush. He never painted directly from nature. If he was painting the human figure he never had a model to pose for him. It must have been the same with the Sukho daya image-makers. If the lesser ones made mechanical facsimiles of existing images as in expensive routine productions, the more expert ones ? who would normally be called on to make the most important images ? must have always proceeded by means of the "memory picture." Even when they wished to copy some image that was an object of local veneration and therefore easily accessible, they would not copy it directly; they would not even stand before it and make sketches in chalk or clay. They would study it with intense concentration, perhaps for days on end, until the memory picture was thoroughly fixed in their mind ? then they would go back to their workshop and copy the memory picture rather than the statue itself. The mental effort of fixing the memory pic ture was inseparable from the act of worshiping the statue. They could not study it without wor shiping it, they could not worship it without fixing the memory picture. This particular form of image-worship is more closely connected with Mahayana than with Hinayana; but Hinayana, though it did not carry it to such mystical heights, tolerated and even encouraged it. And the Sukhodaya artist had at his disposal a ready-made technique ? the technique of trance ? to assist him. The trance exercise in Buddhism, like the related one in Yoga, follows certain definite rules. The practitioner, having chosen the sub ject for meditation, sits cross-legged, with his back and head erect and both his hands lying palm upward in his lap. In order to obtain "one-pointedness of mind," he fixes his gaze upon a shaft of light, or else upon a prepared "artifice," such as earth set in a round con tainer, water in a bowl, air in an empty globe, or the flame of a lamp, or perhaps a Buddha image. He regulates his breathing in the pre scribed fashion. Presently he finds that he can see the "artifice" just as clearly when his eyes are closed as if they were open. After achieving "concentration" (samadhi) he passes on to the successive stages of "meditation" (jhana).38 The Sage of the Sakyas had set the example ? it was "concentration" and "meditation," in which he was a matchless expert, that gave him Supreme Enlightenment. But if he himself taught that the only legitimate purpose of this exercise is to clarify the mind, others have not hesitated to resort to it for a much wider variety of ends ? from telepathy to flying, from getting reborn in heaven to winning lotteries. It is still used in Siam today ? by philosophers to strengthen their resolution in virtue or to solve abstruse metaphysical problems, by fortune tellers to locate lost articles or to predict the future. The Tantrik Buddhists of medieval Bengal used it to "realize" their god, whether to raise themselves to his level and identify themselves with him, or merely to extort ma terial favors from him.39 Often the Indian sculp tors practised it in order to visualize the ideal Being they wished to portray. By concentrating their minds intensely on this Being they got a perfectly clear mental picture that would re main with them after returning to normal con sciousness. It was so sharp a picture that the problem of reproducing it in stone or bronze was no more difficult than for the painter to paint a tree whose memory picture he had formed.40 The devout artists of Sukhodaya must have 20</page><page sequence="29">been well able, by means of a similar technique, to conjure up a vision of the Buddha, resplen dent with all the unearthly beauty of his super natural anatomy, wearing his traditional mo nastic robe, performing the well-known gestures that announced his triumph over evil or gave instruction and reassurance to men. The vision was a figment of disciplined imagination based on previous experience, a composite memory picture made up of elements drawn from many different sources and perfectly integrated to gether. Although we have no record of these anony mous artists except their own masterpieces, we can now imagine the process by which they created the new and characteristic type of Buddha image. By the 13 th century the Thai upper classes in Siam have been converted to Hinayana Bud dhism. Long before it occurs to them to make any sculpture of their own, they have learned to worship Buddha images as their subjects and neighbors have been doing for centuries. Some of these are old images that have been reverently preserved since Dvaravati times. Some are the work of Mon artists who remained beyond the reach of the Khmer conquerors. Some are the work of the humbler schools that carried on the Dvaravati tradition during the long years of the Khmer occupation. Some are the work of Khmer sculptors trained in the "style of the Bayon."41 The Thai have observed that these images can perform miracles. Their basic conception of the Buddha ideal is forever conditioned by them. But since they also know something of the Pali Scriptures and Commentaries, if only in frag ments, they perhaps already notice that the images they have been worshiping do not ex actly correspond to the orthodox descriptions. Meanwhile the Thai have been learning tech nical skills from the Khmer with the same eager ness as they have been learning religion from the Mon. They know how to dig canals, con struct ramparts, put up masonry buildings and ornament them with floral patterns in stucco. They know how to cast bronze into weapons and chariot fittings, gongs and kettledrums, ornaments, utensils and toilet articles. Perhaps indeed they have brought with them from their old homeland in Yunnan some skill in using bronze for such purposes, if not for images as well.42 Would this not help to explain why the Thai soon become so very proficient in bronze and prefer it to any other medium for their art after contact with the Khmer has sharpened their skill? Before gaining their independence, the Thai lords ruling the countryside under Khmer vas salage already have craftsmen working for them ? carpenters and masons, workers in stucco and metal. If at first the skilled craftsmen are chiefly Khmer and Mon, after a time young Thai are apprenticed to them and marry into their fami lies. Their sons inherit the skills of their Khmer and Mon grandfathers, together with the eclec ticism and assimilative powers of their Thai fathers. As the Thai increase in numbers and wealth, they find that there are not enough images in existence to fill their needs. The stage is already set for them to "make merit" by starting pro duction for themselves. The old images that have proved their miraculous power have fixed a certain ideal in their minds. The Pali texts have suggested that some modifications might strengthen this power. And a new generation of craftsmen stand ready to fill the patrons' re quirements. These craftsmen may be humble men, but they are not devoid of religious learning, for nearly every one of them has been a monk for at least a few months when young. They have some understanding of mental concentration and meditation, they live in an atmosphere where the trances are used for all sorts of prac tical purposes. They know something of the Scriptures. Their patrons, guided by the schol arly monks who have studied in Nagara Sri dharmaraja, Lower Burma, or Ceylon, want the new images to comply as closely as possible with the descriptions in the sacred texts. But these 21</page><page sequence="30">descriptions are after all lists of "Marks" ? bumps and lines, symbolic features and unusual proportions?which cannot exist independently. They will somehow have to be fitted on to, or rather incorporated into, an anthropomorphic framework. So when the craftsmen seek to visualize the Buddha, they see him in the form of a Mon or a Khmer image re-shaped in accordance with their recollection of other things. Of these by far the most important are the holy texts. But they may also recall the accounts of gods and heroes in poetry, they may know something of the Indian art manuals. They may have heard returning pilgrims describe famous cult images in other lands. Nor can they altogether forget the appearance of the gentle monks they see and talk with every day ? so that some little touch of realism may intrude into the idealized vision. When they reproduce the vision in bronze or stucco, the elements drawn from such diverse sources do not look as if arbitrarily pieced together; they are as thoroughly assimi lated as they were in the vision itself. And so a new type of Buddha image is cre ated. We do not know how long it took, nor exactly when it happened. We do not even know precisely what this new type was ? although ex amples of it surely exist among the many images that have only begun to be systematically classi fied in recent years. (For possible illustrations, see below, section 6). Some of the images of this new type prove their miraculous powers in practise. Perhaps they show they are more powerful than the Dvaravati and Khmer images by leading the Thai to victory in forays against their neighbors or protecting their cities against counter-attack. The images that can perform such valuable serv ices quickly become famous and are widely venerated. From now on even the most original artists will find that their memory picture of the Buddha is dominated by the newly established type, whatever that was; the influence of Dva ravati and Khmer art will fade into the back ground. The influence of the Pali texts, whose prescriptions have so obviously been respon sible for the superior performance of the Thai images, will, if anything, grow stronger. Images will be imported from Ceylon and elsewhere; but though they will now be available for direct imitation they will have only a minor influence, for the Sukhodaya type is by this time too strongly entrenched to yield much to further innovation. By the time the type is fixed, the style is also. The two great forces that usually impose such strict conservatism on Buddhist art have relaxed long enough to allow a new type of image and a new artistic style to come into being ? a type and style which, once established, will be per petuated by a new conservatism. In the first place, during this formative period the patrons (who at most other times are content to order endless copies of one or two famous prototypes) have felt the need of a composite image made up of different elements drawn from older statuary and from literature. In the second place, during the same formative period the craftsmen have found that the old plastic style they learned from their teachers is too rigid to assimilate such different elements into a harmonious whole. So they have formed new habits to deal with all those passages of the anatomy, those details of drapery, on which the Scriptures and Commen taries furnish no guidance. Passages and details of this kind ? which meant little to the patron, but which in modern eyes are so decisive in the appearance of the work ? have come from a memory picture made up of elements from the same sources as the iconography . . . except that in this case the holy texts can play no part. No iron-clad orthodoxy has formed them. A sort of empirical growth, in which individual inven tion played an unconscious part, has established the plastic habits that will most faithfully serve to portray the ideal vision. 22</page><page sequence="31">4. The High Classic Style: Walking Buddhas Now that we have an idea of the historical background, the motives of the patrons, and the methods of the artists, we can make a more de tailed study. If I were sure which particular group of images was made first, I could trace the development of the art more logically. But while I feel confident the earliest are those that most closely resemble Mon or Khmer art, and while I shall later suggest possible examples in the illustrations, I am not sure that I have chosen the examples wisely. So instead of analyzing these supposedly early ones, I shall skip directly to the "high classic" group, beginning with an examination of the Walking Buddhas that re veal the art at its best. This examination will show that every element of the iconography that was considered important can be traced back ultimately to India, whereas everything else is, in a very real sense, original. By a process of error and exaggeration ? or was it really a progressive refinement of meta phor, never intended to be taken literally? ? the Pali Commentators in Ceylon had worked up a preposterous description of the Buddha's per son. It is far more extravagant than anything the Dvaravati ?sculptors had to cope with. The Marks as they had known them were a relatively sober list; they had used them sparingly, in the manner of insignia. The Khmer had given them little prominence. Even the Sinhalese sculptors, though they must have been familiar with the description given in the works of their literary compatriots, did not follow it very scrupulously. But the Sukhodaya image-maker took it as his supreme authority. He knew the Marks were essential; he felt them deeply; he saw them in his memory picture. And he reproduced them in his statuary ? very evidently so in the high classic group, and perhaps in the earlier groups as well. Since "Buddha's skin is the color of gold," he covered the whole statue with lacquer and gold leaf. Sometimes in this lacquer, sometimes in the bronze itself, the sculptor engraved three of the Marks: a Wheel on the footsole; a "network of lines" on the palm (either in the form of a Wheel or else in the form of a lozenge-shaped "reticulation"); and a "tuft of luminous down'' on the forehead, represented by a single hair drawn as a clockwise helix with an upward tail, in the shape of the Sanskrit "magic syllable" OM. These Marks can be seen in only a few statues today (e.g. Fig. 25), for they have mostly been effaced by wear, patination, or re-gilding in modern times. But the rest of the super natural anatomy stands out boldly ? especially in the Walking Buddhas. From the top of the ushnisha there springs a tall tongue of flame. Every curl of hair is a delicate spiral. The pierced ear-lobes are long and sinuous. The torso is "lion-like," with broad shoulders, bulg ing breast, narrow waist. The arms are so long that Buddha "can stand up straight and touch his knees without bending." Through the trans parent garments it can be clearly seen that "nature has concealed the organs of sex." The heel is "long and projecting," the footsoles "per fectly flat," the toes "of equal length."43 (Figs. 4, 5, 11, 12, 14; cf. Figs. 9, 10, 13, 15). Of course the high classic sculptor does not use all the thirty-two major and eighty lesser Marks. Some of these deal with matters that are irrelevant to sculpture, such as a sweet and resonant voice, dazzling white teeth, an exces sively long tongue. Some are vague, such as a "well-made head." Some are mutually contra dictory, such as a "perfectly flat footsole" and a "convexity on the footsole." And one Mark ? "the four fingers of each hand equal in length'' ? the high classic sculptor seems to have re jected deliberately, as though in this one thing aesthetic considerations were stronger than orthodoxy. Even with these reservations, the program is a formidable one. When an uninspired crafts man attempted it he produced monstrosities. But the real artist, expert in conjuring up an idealized vision based on a composite memory 23</page><page sequence="32">picture, succeeded in turning what seems to us a compendium of folly into a canon of unworld ly beauty. Just as the memory picture that inspired the first Sukhodaya image-makers was a Dvaravati or Khmer Buddha re-shaped to conform to whatever passages of the holy texts they knew, so the memory picture that inspires the high classic artist must be an early Sukhodaya Bud dha re-shaped to conform more exactly. The arms have lengthened, the shoulders broadened; the chest has deepened and the waist narrowed; all the appropriate Marks are present. But no great change has taken place in the ushnisha and spiral curls and long ear-lobes ? for even in Dvaravati images these things had already been in agreement with the texts. Some other features, on which the texts are silent, also re main unchanged. The artist remembers the downcast eyes of the old images, the respondent ogees of the upper and lower lids. He remem bers their pensive smile and the incised line that accents the silhouette of lips. All these things are part of his mental picture, and he gives them new elegance in the high classic style. (Compare Fig. 7 with Figs. 4, 25 and 29). The artist has very likely heard the recita tions of actors performing a Siamese version of the Ramayana, or gleaned something from the Indian art manuals that the learned Brahmins have memorized. At any rate it is evident that he knows the stereotyped similes that Sanskrit poetry used in describing gods and heroes, or, what amounts to the same thing, the similes given in the manuals as guides to anatomical structure. Such similes have made a stronger impression on him than they made on the sculptors of Dvaravati and Cambodia. He un derstands them a bit differently from the Indian artists, a bit more literally ? and it is in this form that they have become part of his memory picture. The shape of the head, as he sees it, is "like an egg"; the curls of the hair are "like the stings of scorpions." The nose is "like a parrot's beak" and the eyebrows "like drawn bows above it." The chin, with its incised oval line, is "like a lemon." (Cf. Fig. 25). The neck has three horizontal creases "like the upper part of a conch shell." The arms are smooth and rounded "like the trunk of a young elephant"; the hands are "like lotus flowers just beginning to open," with the finger-tips turned delicately backward like petals. The thighs are "like the stalk of a plantain tree." There is "no display of bones, muscles, or veins."44 This last principle does not prevent the artist from indicating a peculiar development of the abdomen such as would result from the constant practise of breath-control, the prelude to "men tal concentration." It is an appropriate feature of the Buddha ideal as he sees it, and a familiar part of his own experience. The artist has probably heard returning pil grims describe the famous statues at Pagan, Bodhgaya, Anuradhapura. He has seen repro ductions of some of them in clay votive tablets no bigger than a postage stamp.45 Perhaps a feature or two, remembered from the pilgrim's tales or enlarged from the clay tablets, will have lodged in his mental vision. This must be the source of the tongue of flame he sees springing from the top of Buddha's head. It was a feature unknown to Dvaravati and the Khmer, but it appears in some bronzes from Bodhgaya, Na landa, and Negapatam in India, as well as in some Sinhalese and Burmese statuary.46 But the Sukhodaya artist gives it a new form ? perhaps because he could not make it out very well on the miniature votive tablets, or more likely be cause it has such a vital significance in his ideal. The direct plastic influence from Burma, India, or Ceylon will in any case never be strong.47 He will never abandon his fundamental conception, based on images of local veneration and Pali or Sanskrit literature. Even less would he think of attempting to copy nature. But all around him, walking in the streets with downcast eyes or meditating in the monasteries with eyes concentrated upon some "artifice" on the ground, he has seen holy monks. In his own vision, the recollection of these real people is not nearly so vivid as his 24</page><page sequence="33">recollection of the older images and of texts; but it is not wholly forgotten. Sometimes it serves to confirm his preconceived ideal, sometimes to change it slightly. The delicate oval of these real faces is the same as he remembers from Indian literature, the arch of these real eyebrows more like the "drawn bows" in poetry than the eyebrows of Dvaravati or Khmer statues. The curve of these real eyelids is almost the same as he remembers from the old statuary; but these real mouths are smaller, these real lips finer. When now and then a hint of nature, derived from real life, becomes part of the statue, it is nature so idealized that it does not conflict at all with the other components. All have been har moniously integrated in the memory picture.48 The monastic robe is a familiar sight to the artist. Each morning a long line of yellow-clad monks, making their daily round in quest of food, pass along the street in front of his shop, and very likely his wife, piously kneeling in front of them, will fill their begging-bowls with rice and curry. He knows the form of the robe and exactly how it should be worn ? for he him self was once a monk. He knows that it consists of three separate pieces ? each one a large un tailored rectangle of yellow cloth. The first is a waist-cloth, worn around the hips like a sarong, reaching down nearly to the ankles. (Fig. 16). The second piece is the upper garment; wrapped around the body like a long toga, it covers the left shoulder and arm but leaves the right bare, and it reaches down to the calves.49 (Fig. 17). The third piece ? which is really a spare to be used as a mantle or blanket ? is on formal occasions folded in neat pleats; hung over the left shoulder like a scarf, it reaches nearly to the waist in front and nearly to the hip behind. (Figs. 18 and 19. Cf. Figs. 9, 11, 23 and 24). It would be easy for the artist to make an exact likeness of these garments in bronze, showing every fold of the coarse cotton exactly as it hangs. But this does not occur to him. For his ideas are conditioned by the Post-Gupta convention ? respected alike by the Mon and the Khmer ? that the Buddha's monastic robe must be thin, transparent, adhering closely to the body without a crease, allowing every con tour of the torso and limbs to "shine through" the cloth. The two divergent ideas ? the estab lished convention and the artist's own clear knowledge of what a robe really consists of ? have been reconciled in the vision. The robe has become less a visual likeness than a diagram in three dimensions. Like a diagram, it does not purport to reproduce the appearance; it ex plains how the thing is put together. Where it clings to the body, the robe is invisible; but its form is defined by its silhouette, and there are lines or ridges at the ankles, at the wrist, and across the chest, to mark the division between cloth and flesh. The top of the waist-cloth, gent ly constricting the flesh of the abdomen, is visible through the transparency of the upper garment; and the contours of the body, in turn, are visible through both. The scarf over the left shoulder is reduced to a graceful strip, and its ends ? as though the pleats were very slightly unfolding ? furnish the excuse for an attractive fer-de-lance pattern.50 In such passages as these, and where the cloth falls free, the convention is relaxed. The dress still ripples with movement, though its wearer has come to a momentary halt in his walk; the outline of the material hanging from the left arm undulates, and the lower corners of the skirts turn forward in a little hook-shaped design. (Figs. 12, etc.). The iconography of attitude and gesture is orthodox. The attitude is the same as the In dians had been using since ancient times in bas-reliefs to depict any episode in which Bud dha is supposed to be walking; the artist has seen it reproduced again and again in clay votive tablets. And the gesture too has long been well known to the whole Buddhist world. In all these things ? anatomy, dress, and pos ture ? though the artist chooses and rejects, though he makes fresh combinations of the ancient material, though he draws more on literature than sculptural example, he invents nothing really new. 25</page><page sequence="34">But what a change he makes in the plastic conception! What brilliant originality he puts forth in those things that to us make all the difference between a routine production and a masterpiece! For it is these very things which ? since they matter least of all to the patrons, since orthodoxy is silent on them ? the artist is free to interpret in his own way. The Walking Buddha has emerged from the reliefs in which sculpture has until now always held him captive; he is fully realized "in the round."51 To students of Buddhist art, who know how stubbornly conservative it is, this is an amazing development. Plenty of standing or seated images "in the round" have been produced by Indians and Sinhalese, Mon and Khmer and Burmese ? but since most of them were intended to be placed against a wall or in a niche, the profile is seldom well thought out, and the back may be only a perfunctory sketch; although the slab back ground has evaporated, the sculptors still seem to have been thinking in terms of high relief. But the Walking Buddhas of Sukhodaya are truly three-dimensional.52 As if they were in tended to receive the obeisance of circumambu lation, they are just as good when seen from front or rear or side, best of all when looked at from every angle in succession. The act of walk ing ? momentarily arrested, but about to be resumed ? is expressed in clear, vigorous terms. The head with its flame-topped ushnisha leans a little forward, the broad shoulders swing side wise. One elongated arm drops in an adroit curve at the side. The forearm of the other is upraised; the palm faces forward to display the network of lines in its center; the petal-like fingers all point upward in the gesture of Dis pelling Fear, or else one of them is bent to join the thumb in the gesture of Exposition. Whether they are working in bronze or stuc co, the great artists of Sukhodaya use their ma terial knowingly. They never disguise it to give the illusion of flesh or drapery ? for it is not the likeness of a man clad in stuff, it is the like ness of a vision such as might be seen in trance. The conception lends itself to simplified treat ment, with the chief reliance placed on silhou ette and much surface left unadorned. While irrelevant detail is suppressed, small matters are lovingly worked over ? the curve of an eyelid or a mouth, a slim hand with its tapering fingers, a passage of free-hanging cloth with a suggestion of folds worked into a skilful pattern. The modeling too has a trance-like quality. It is never stiff or abrupt. It is always fluid ? some times with the undisturbed flow of slow waters, sometimes with the smooth ripple of a stream passing over rounded pebbles. This fluidity is something new in the bronze Buddhas of Siam. How different it is from the motionless stiffness of the Buddhas made by Dvaravati or Khmer metalworkers! There may be a technical reason for the difference. The Khmer sculptor, when making the clay and wax model that would be come the core of the bronze casting, attacked the material in the same manner and with the same sort of tools as if he were making a stone statue: he carved it, progressively removing but never adding; he did not model it in the true sense, as the softness of the material would have allowed. The Sukhodaya artist, so far as we can judge from the finished product, must have shaped the clay plastically, using fingers and modeling tools. He may have learned this tech nique from the Mon workers in stucco and terra cotta, whose art since Dvaravati times had been marked by a freedom unknown to stone and bronze statuary. The Sukhodaya stucco images and terra cotta heads have something of the same freedom. Perhaps some Sukhodaya image maker, urged on by his patron's preference for bronze, hit on the happy idea of using the terra cotta plastic technique to shape the clay for his casting ? and so introduced the only possible procedure that could translate the ethereal vis ion into metal without petrifying it.53 The outstanding qualities of the Buddha are well expressed in the very nature of the plastic treatment. The "calmness of his inner being" shows up in the fluid modeling and undulating line, unobstructed by any tension of feature. 26</page><page sequence="35">The "fullness of his personality" shows up in the rotundity of torso and thighs, shoulders and arms; it shows up in the three-dimensional qual ity of the bronzes and the massive volumes of the stucco reliefs. His "lion-like heroism" shows up in the broad shoulders and deep chest. His "compassionate kindness" shows up in the smoothness of the flesh, and especially in the sensitive modeling of the face and hands, re echoed in the delicate stylization of the cloth folds in scarf and skirt. In this expression of his compassionate kindness, the art of Sukhodaya carries the Gupta tradition to its logical conclu sion. Though much further away in time, it really comes nearer to Gupta art in spirit than Dvaravati art itself ever came.54 Nowhere is the "fiery energy" of Buddha so well expressed as in these statues. They look as if the artist, in order to conceive such a Being, used the "fire artifice" to aid in bringing on his vision, just as that Being himself used the "fire artifice" to aid in bringing on the intellectual concentration from which his fiery energy de rived.55 The surfaces overlaid with burnished gold take on a more spiritual meaning than ever; the whole body twists with the rhythmic anima tion of its interior fires and imparts its own "transparency" to the clothing. The flames, lick ing forth from the flesh, transform the "lumi nous down" in the middle of the forehead into the symbol of the Supernal Sun, the magic syl lable OM; and a jet of flame, shaped to the same magic syllable, bursts out from the top of the ushnisha. The sculptors of Amaravati had long ago tried to translate into stone the conception of the "Buddha all aflame" ? first as an aniconic symbol in the Pillar of Fire, and later on as a supernatural person with jets of flame springing out all over his body. But they had never suc ceeded in giving it final aesthetic expression.56 Here at last is its perfect realization. We can easily guess why images of the Walk ing Buddha were popular at Sukhodaya, and what their particular significance was. They rep resent the Missionary Buddha, the Buddha en gaged upon those tireless Peregrinations in which he made such vast numbers of converts among gods and men ? and demons.57 Although King Rama Gamheng asserts that everyone "without any exception in this city of Sukhodaya is devoted to the religion of Bud dha," the facts were no doubt otherwise. He himself sees nothing incongruous in recalling that it is necessary to make offerings to "the divine demon of the hill." Even today, among the simple, animism is exceedingly vigorous in Siam; at that time it must have been much more so. The demons required to be constantly pro pitiated. As in India and Ceylon, Buddhism was unable to stamp such beliefs out, for the idea of religious persecution was utterly foreign to it. So it had to make compromises. It had to prove that the demons themselves embraced the Doc trine eagerly. Did the people worship tree nymphs? Then they should know that these leafy creatures not only provided food for monks who made pilgrimages through the forest, but also frequently gave them sound advice: "Fol low the Doctrine scrupulously!" Did the people worship Nagas? Then they should recall that these terrible serpent-demons, who could as sume human form and pass through the earth at will, acknowledged Buddha's superiority. By the power of his fiery energy Buddha had sub dued the fierce Naga at Uruvela and converted him. A devout Naga had used his hood as an umbrella to shelter Buddha from a storm with out interrupting his meditation. A Naga had even become a monk ? but his zeal was con sidered excessive. At the request of still another Naga, who was a recent convert, Buddha had pressed his footsole into the clay on a river-bank and left its imprint as a permanent memento of his visit. This was not the only time he left his foot print as a memento. By far the most famous occasion was when he flew to Ceylon by the power of his fiery energy and stamped an im pression of his foot in the rock on top of the mountain called Adam's Peak ? an impression 27</page><page sequence="36">that was to remain forever "as a seal to show that Ceylon is the inheritance of Buddha and that his religion will here flourish."58 The symbolism of footprints ? much older and more widespread than Buddhism ? is a most obvious device to record the passage of a god or conqueror.59 Early Buddhist art had in dicated the presence of the invisible Being and identified the Pillar of Fire by means of Wheel marked footprints. This Wheel, incidentally, had done service for a variety of meanings. Per haps originally a solar emblem or a sign of fleet ness of foot, it was also the Quoit of gods and emperors. As a symbol of the eternal round of transmigrations, it became the aniconic indi cator of the Buddha's First Sermon ? the "set ting in motion the Wheel of the Law." And as the Wheel of the Law it signifies the onrolling progress of the Doctrine.60 The famous Footprint on Adam's Peak can still be seen. Nearly two yards long, it is appar ently a natural depression in the rock. Though its resemblance to a human foot is not very striking, the different sects in modern Ceylon all agree that it is a footprint ? but they dis agree as to its authorship. The Muslims attrib ute it to Adam, the Hindus to Siva, and some of the Portuguese Christians to the Queen of Ethiopia's eunuch.61 While its size is roughly proportionate to the thirty-foot stature of the legendary Buddha and to the Tooth Relic at Kandy, it is not easy to see how the Buddhists reconciled its form to their traditional concep tions: for there is no sign of a Wheel on it, much less the galaxy of 108 auspicious signs which, according to the Commentators, marked Bud dha's footsole.62 But plausibility is no test either of pious leg end or of apt parable. As with all their stories, Buddhists can take the tale of the flight to Cey lon and the planting of the footprint in either of two ways. While the simple take it for plain fact, rationalists take it as a vivid metaphor to declare how missionaries, "fired with zeal," brought the Doctrine to the island long ago. The Walking Buddha represents the mis sionary aspect of the religion. If he performs the gesture of Exposition as he moves forward, he is obviously converting someone; if he per forms the gesture of Dispelling Fear, he has just completed a conversion. But he is also doing something else: he is pressing one foot to the ground as if pressing a seal into sealing-wax, exactly as he did on Adam's Peak.63 The Kings of Sukhodaya, eager to follow the example of Ceylon in all religious matters, must often have wished that the great Sage had fa vored their country as he had favored that island, by visiting it and leaving a Footprint as a record of his peaceful conquest; but no such event had then been heard of.64 So they had to be satisfied with replicas. One of them sent to Ceylon, an inscription tells us, to "have an im pression taken of the trace left by the Master's foot on Adam's Peak," and then caused copies to be made "in conformity with the original."65 Another caused "pictures of the Lord Buddha's two feet" to be engraved in stone, "similar and conforming in measure to the holy Footprint manifested by the supreme Lord of the World on Adam's Peak, that best of mountains, that jeweled crown of the island of Ceylon; they are lovely in the highest degree, shining and re splendent with the eminent mark of the Wheel, and covered with the 108 supremely propitious signs."66 The Sukhodaya Footprints are "replicas" of the original only in the sense that they embody its essence by reproducing its length exactly.67 But in appearance they are no more like that famous depression than they are like a human foot. They are huge diagrams, incised or em bossed, on stone or metal tablets. (Fig. 20). The Wheel ? which has been such a conspicuous mark on Buddha's footsole since the beginning of Buddhist art ? occupies the middle; within it in concentric circles, or else outside it in a checkerboard pattern, are the 108 auspicious symbols.68 Since the grouping varies so much in different examples, it is plain that the Footprints are by no means accurate copies of any one model, let alone the print on Adam's Peak ? 28</page><page sequence="37">they are inspired simply by the list given in the Pali texts. The 108 signs, or at any rate some of them, recall the paraphernalia of "podoscopy," a sys tem of divination current in many parts of the orient. As palmistry relies on an inspection of the lines and creases in the hand, so podoscopy relies on an inspection of the lines and creases in the footsole. And as a palmist's chart might use little pictures instead of letters to label the "Mountain of Mercury" or the "Mountain of the Moon," so, perhaps, the diagrammatic Foot prints ? and indeed the Pali lists also ? may de rive ultimately from ancient podoscopic charts in which the 108 "signs" were labels of auspi cious skin formations.69 But they have another significance as well. They are a sort of condensed gazetteer of the universe ? sixteen upper heavens with their Brahma gods; six lower heavens with their Devas; the stars and the planets; the earth with its geography and samples of the good things it contains. Here is the Central Mountain, sur rounded by seven concentric rock-walled Seas, here are the four great Continents with their associated Islands, here are the seven great Rivers and Lakes. Here are the fauna and flora of good omen, the regalia of benevolent kings, the ritual utensils of holy monks.70 Since Bud dha wears all these things on his footsole, they are subordinate to him and support him; they are but small items in the encyclopedia of his boundless wisdom; they announce his utterly exceptional character. So when the Walking Buddha wishes to sig nify that a land "is his inheritance" he places this prodigious seal upon it. And when a ruler wishes to signify that in his land "Buddha's re ligion will flourish," he can hardly do better than to install such seals on hilltops near his principal cities, at the same time ordering his sculptors to make images of the Lord of the World himself converting the people and im pressing his Footprint. One such Footprint was installed on a hilltop near the capital, and the hill was given the San skrit name for Adam's Peak. "This mountain," says an inscription dating from the second half of the 14th century, "is named Sumanakuta parvata because it has upon its summit a copy made from the footprint left by our Lord Buddha on the top of Mount Sumanakuta parvata in Ceylon. It was put here so that divinities and men might come to salute it, respect it, and pay it homage. Whoever climbs to the top of this mountain to salute the Foot print of our Lord Buddha will surely obtain the Three Prosperities." The inscription goes on to describe how the King made a visit of obeisance to it. "The road from Sukhodaya to the hilltop was magnificently decorated. On both sides of the road ceremonial trees had been planted and garlands of flowers hung up. Torch es and candles and lamps were lighted, and fragrant incense was burning. There were flags and banners everywhere. On both sides of the road there were trays of areca nut and betel leaves. After doing obeisance, the people made merry, dancing, leaping, and amusing them selves in a thousand ways. They sang songs of pious deeds; and again they did obeisance, ac companied by the music of wind instruments and strings, gongs and drums, of such loudness one might have thought the earth would burst."71 5. The High Classic Style: Reclining Buddhas and Seated Buddhas I have discussed at length the Walking Bud dhas for several reasons. They are the most characteristic and original creations of Sukho daya art. They best exemplify the high classic style. They best illustrate how it uses a mixture of svmbols and human forms. Thev best exhibit the supernatural anatomy and the correct styli zation of the robe. And because of their associ ation with the Footprints, which are in turn so intimately associated with Ceylon, they best reveal the psychology of the patron when he ordered a "conv " 29</page><page sequence="38">But they are by no means the most numerous examples of the high classic style. The holy texts have told the artist that there are "four proper positions" in which he may depict the Buddha: walking, standing, sitting, lying down.72 Like his mental picture of the walking position, his mental pictures of these other attitudes follow the schemes that had de veloped long ago in India and later became the common property of Buddhist art everywhere. They are the same schemes that appear in so many stone reliefs in India portraying the Eight Great Events in Buddha's career ? reliefs made from the time of Gandhara down to the time of the Palas and Senas. They are the same schemes that appear on the little clay tablets that were sold as souvenirs and amulets at the eight places in India where these Events had occurred. The little clay tablets faithfully re produce the attitude and gesture of the prin cipal cult image in the particular place where they were sold ? an attitude and gesture appro priate to the Great Event associated with that place. Such inexpensive phylacteries of clay have been circulating in Siam in huge quanti ties since the earliest times ? some imported from India, and many more locally - made adaptations.73 The Sukhodaya artist may never have seen an Indian stone relief in his life. But he knows the little clay tablets well. For he himself, as well as every member of his family, wears one on a chain around the neck ? a miniature in surance policy against evil spirits, accident, and downheartedness. The Buddha that appears to him in his vision cannot help assuming one of the postures depicted in the clay tablets, which in turn is the same as some cut-out from a stone relief of the Great Magical Display. The Walk ing Buddha therefore assumes the same posture as if midway to earth in his Descent from Heaven; the Standing Buddha the same as if Taming the Elephant; the Seated Buddha the same as if Receiving the Monkey's Gift or Call ing the Earth to Witness; the Reclining Buddha the same as if lying on his deathbed in the last moments preceding Total Extinction.74 Since Standing Buddhas hardly appear at all during the best period, but are frequent later, I shall reserve a discussion of them until after finishing with the high classic style. Reclining Buddhas are also rare in the best period. I know of only one first-rate example. This image ? which is a rarity for another rea son as well, because it is carved in stone ? is now in a monastery in Bangkok. (Fig. 21). It shows the virtuosity of the Sukhodaya classic artist in converting apparent absurdities into peculiar beauties. Here he has to deal not only with the supernatural anatomy, but with an other convention as well ? for ever since the days of Gandhara custom has decreed that an image of the Reclining Buddha must be con ceived as an image of the Standing Buddha which has been laid down upon its right side.75 As minor concessions to common sense, the pro jecting skirts on the under side are suppressed and the shoulders are tilted so that the head may lie on the hand. But the skirts of the robe at the upper side rise into the air, in defiance of gravity ? simply because they floated out to the left of the leg when the figure was standing. With consummate skill the artist has prevented this feature from looking foolish. He has made it look miraculous. The Seated Buddhas are by far the most numerous. The Sage sits with his legs folded, as we should say, "tailor-fashion"; his right foot, with the sole turned up, lies on top of his left calf, while his left foot is only partly visible be neath his right calf. This arrangement of the legs is the same as in Sinhalese and Khmer art; it is different from the tightly-locked "lotus position" usual in the sculpture of northern India, Bengal, and Burma; and slightly differ ent again from that of Amaravati and Dvara vati, in which the legs were as a rule loosely crossed at the ankles. This attitude, which occidentals find so un comfortable, is natural enough in the east. It is one of the postures recommended for medita 30</page><page sequence="39">tive trance. If ? as is sometimes seen in Sukho daya art ? the Sage has both hands in his lap with the palms upward, he is engaged in just such Meditation. He may sit on a plain pedestal, or else on the coiled serpent body of the pious Naga King who has spread his hood to provide shelter for uninterrupted meditation during a storm.76 (Fig. 22). But much more often he is Calling the Earth to Witness. (Figs. 23-28). He is on the very threshold of Enlightenment. He has spent the whole day in Meditation. Now at nightfall the Lord of Evil tries to turn him from the path that will soon bring him supreme wisdom. Without altering the position of Meditation in any other way, the Sage has moved his right hand and placed it on his knee, pointing the fingers downward to Call the Earth to Witness his immunity from the temptations and as saults of wickedness. As a rule the pedestal he sits on is undeco rated. It may rest on its own narrow vertical flange, or else on four short legs ? three in front and one behind. In plan it is like a crescent with the horns rounded off, for it is shaped to the outline of his seat and legs. (Figs. 24, 27). In principle, the Seated Buddha has the same anatomy and wears the same dress as the Walk ing Buddha. But the posture does not allow such a bold display of either. Long arms and projecting heels are less conspicuous; some times the foot seems to be modeled less on the Pali texts, which prescribe a "flat sole" and "equal toes" than on the art manuals ? for, like the hands, it may now have all the grace of a "lotus flower beginning to open." The robe is still a correct diagram ? but instead of being manifested as a sharp silhouette of skirts, the lower hems of the waist-cloth and of the upper garment are now a pair of ridges at each ankle. (Compare fig. 23 with fig. 19). The space be tween the chest and the right arm is left vacant ? there is no cloth there, since the right shoul der is bare; but the cloth falling from the left shoulder is clearly shown. (This is a point the Khmer sculptors sometimes failed to grasp correctly). These Seated Buddhas can be just as beauti ful as all but a very few of the Walking Bud dhas. On the average they are much better ? for only the top artists could make a good Walk ing Buddha; it was easier to avoid failure with seated images. Because of their orthodox frontality they seem more suited to receiving obeisance from the front than by circumambu lation. Yet, while they lack the strikingly three dimensional quality of the walking figures, they are conceived and well realized in the round. Seen in profile, the head is an elegant oval, the face ? with its nose "like a parrot's beak" ? is majestically ethereal, the bulging chest stands out boldly. (Fig. 25). Even the rear is not neg lected: the flame, the curls, and the fer-de-lance pattern that terminates the scarf at the hip are all modeled with the same perfection as their counterparts in front. (Fig. 26). The Seated Buddhas of the high classic style have the same plastic qualities as the Walking ones. Although the interest of momentarily arrested motion is absent, the nervous energy is still there. In their own way they are just as flame-like.77 6. Various Subdivisions of the Sukhodaya Style and Their Chronology According to modern Siamese taste, the great image called Brah Buddha Jinaraja, which is in a monastery at Bishnuloka, is the most beautiful ever made. (Fig. 30). As if to explain its excep tional beauty, an old legend says that it was cast by the god Indra, who descended to earth dis guised as a wandering ascetic and took charge of the work.78 Almost as much admired is its companion image Brah Buddha Jinasiha, now in a monastery in Bangkok. (Fig. 31). These two statutes and a few similar ones constitute a special subdivision of the Sukho daya style. Lovely as they are, I think they do not quite match the high classic. 31</page><page sequence="40">The pedestal is no longer plain and unorna mented; it is now, like the majority of pedestals throughout the Indianized east, decorated with lotus petals. But while this decoration is both graceful and significant, it detracts something from the interest of the figure itself. The four fingers of each hand are of equal length ? a piece of labored orthodoxy that the high classic rejected, and that does not quite succeed here.79 The oval of the face has become rounder, the cheeks more full. Is not the sweetness of the expression something of an anticlimax after the spiritual vitality of the high classic? The con tours of the body are more static than flowing; what the modeling has gained in honeyed soft ness it has lost in vigor. Jinaraja and its com panion pieces are finer expressions of deep tranquillity than of religious energy. The tongue of flame attached to the top of the head springs from no inner fire. * # # Perhaps King Rama Gamheng's grandson took his gentle religion too literally. In 1349, when he was threatened by another Thai prince who ruled over a state to the south, he submit ted without resistance. For some time he and his descendants were allowed to rule at Sukhodaya as vassals of the Kings of Ayudhya. Though their independ ence was gone, their art schools were not extinguished. It is thought that the "Jinaraja" group of images dates from this period ? say the second half of the 14th century.80 The so-called "late Bishnuloka group" ? a long series of images more or less influenced by the prestige of Jinaraja ? probably dates for the most part from the 15 th century, when the viceroys of Ayudhya administered the con quered provinces from a provisional capital at Bishnuloka. Many of these statues are attractive pieces ? but they are inert. (Figs. 32-34). They have some of the faults commonly associated with the Ayudhya school, which became notorious for sacrificing quality to quantity. Even at Sukho daya the image-makers of this period seem to have forgotten how to visualize their ideal by means of composite memory picture or medita tive trance; their imitations become more and more mechanical. Unable to deal with the problem of momentarily arrested motion, they are not very successful in portraying the Walk ing Buddha. Instead they turn out quantities of stereotyped images of the Seated Buddha and the Standing Buddha. The shape of the head is no longer the firm delicate oval it was in the classic period ? it has become a little too elongated or a little too squat. The face tends to be insipid, the eye brows seem to be raised in surprise. The super natural anatomy is less a matter of conviction than of habit. The modeling has lost its rip pling flow; it has become dry and motionless. The little details, formerly so lovingly worked over, now seem more like machine-made stamp ings. Yet even in its decadence Sukhodaya art does not yield to the tendency to over-elabora tion and fussy patterns that finally overtook Ayudhya. Though it becomes perfunctory it remains chaste.81 While the Seated Buddhas ? nearly all "Call ing the Earth to Witness" ?are no more than progressively poorer imitations of the estab lished style, the Standing Buddhas are not quite the same thing as static versions of the earlier Walking Buddhas. Their frontality is not only appropriate to the posture, but also in keeping with the lim ited capabilities of this period. One or both hands may perform a stiff gesture ? Dispelling Fear or Exposition ? or else both arms may hang stiffly at the sides, the fingers gingerly touching the knife-like edge of the robe or else barely avoiding it. (Figs. 33, 34). The costume displays some unhappy innovations, perhaps borrowed from Ayudhya and ultimately from the Khmer. The cloth looks as if starched. The outer robe now covers both shoulders, instead of exposing the right one. As a diagram it is almost always faulty: the line that should show the division between cloth and flesh at the neck 32</page><page sequence="41">is forgotten, or even confused with the lowest crease in the neck itself. Through the trans parency of the outer robe the waist-cloth can be seen, with its overhang at the waist and its panel of additional cloth falling down stiffly in front of the legs like a rectangular strip of cardboard. The scarf over the left shoulder has disap peared, together with the elegant fer-de-lance pattern at its end.82 The only relic of movement in the free hang of the skirts beside the legs is the pair of little hook-shaped returns at the lower corners ? for this feature, so beautifully treated in the Walking Buddhas of the great period, remains a sort of trade-mark of the Sukhodaya school even in its decadence ? a trade-mark none of its many imitators in the Ayudhya school ever learn to adopt. # # # The most obvious way to try to classify the various subdivisions of the Sukhodaya style is by a process of elimination. It is easy enough to distinguish the three subdivisions I have de scribed ? the high classic and the two post classic series. I have little hesitation in atribut ing to one or another of these groups every bronze image of life size or larger that I know of, as well as the great majority of smaller ones and most of the stuccoes.83 (High classic: figs. 4, 5, 11, 12, 14, 21, 23-29. Jinaraja group: figs. 30, 31. Late Bishnuloka group: figs. 32-34). When these have been set aside, what have we left? A very heterogeneous lot, no doubt dating all the way from the early 13th century to the 15th or 16th, which for the present must still be considered "unclassified." The lot in cludes a few important stuccoes, and a great many bronzes of modest size. By definition, each one has something about it ? plastic style, iconography, or facial feature ? that would make me unwilling, or at least hesitant, to place it in one of the three known groups. # # # The chronology of Sukhodaya art remains uncertain. If the "Jinaraja" group dates in the second half of the 14th century, and the "late Bishnuloka" series mainly in the 15th, it seems reasonable to date the high classic in the period of Sukhodaya's political greatness and material prosperity ? perhaps chiefly in the first half of the 14th. But had the high classic started earlier? When King Rama Gamheng, in 1292, mentions with such frank satisfaction the ''images eighteen cubits high, the large images, and the medium-sized images" that adorn his city, is he already speaking of the high classic? It has generally been assumed so; but in fact there is not much evidence one way or the other. But it stands to reason that the earliest ex amples of the Sukhodaya style (whether they should be dated in Rama Gamheng's reign or his father's) should be sought in the "unclassified" group. The first attempts would naturally be either stuccoes or else very small bronzes. They would be fairly close to Mon or Khmer art. It is easy to pick out plausible specimens (such as figs. 36 and 37), but it would be premature to have much confidence in the choice. A little later, just before the high classic has developed, we might expect some more ambi tious stuccoes, as well as some bronzes of slightly larger size than before. We should expect the style to have a certain fluidity and a certain fin ish, but not yet to be fully developed. Again, plausible examples may be cited. (Fig. 13 and fig. 9. Both are very nearly high classic. Cf. note 53). A great many pieces in the "unclassified" group may be geographical variations, aberrant types, or merely inferior examples of the high classic or post-classic groups. The art of Kam beng Bejra, for instance, is a little different from the art of the metropolitan area. (Fig. 39). The art of Supanburi is a little different again. (Fig. 15). Both of them probably date mostly in the post-classic period. Quite apart from such geographical variations, there are several aberrant types. Each of them, it may be guessed, resulted from copying and recopying some par ticular statue that happened to be more or less unusual. The copyist would try to reproduce 33</page><page sequence="42">two or three of the most conspicuous icono graphical features of the original. The so-called "Wat Ta-kuan type," much prized by Bangkok collectors of the curious, has peculiar facial features. (Fig. 38). Perhaps the original that in spired them had gained a reputation for magic powers out of all proportion to the mediocre quality of its workmanship; or, perhaps, as some connoisseurs think, the type is pre-classic. A second aberrant type has a lyre-shaped flame on top of the ushnisha, surely imitated from a Sinhalese original; none of the examples I have seen can be particularly early. A third type dates almost surely in the late 15th and 16th centuries, for it has most of the iconography of the "Lion" type that was so popular in north ern Siam at that period.84 (See fig. 40). No doubt other aberrant series could be sorted out. Then too there is the usual quota of pieces so badly damaged as to defy classification (figs. 2, 3), and ? even worse ? pieces that have been skilfully repaired or fancifully altered in mod ern times. Finally, it must be admitted, there are many examples of such inferior workman ship that they are not worth classifying (I re frain from illustrating them). For even the image-makers of the high classic period were not exempt from failure. 7. Conclusion To many westerners Siamese sculpture is dreadfully monotonous. Especially in the later schools, the quantity of its production staggers the imagination. Ninety-five percent of it con sists of Buddha images, and ninety percent of these do nothing but stand or sit, performing one out of a choice of only three gestures. But the high classic style of Sukhodaya, if iso lated from the rest, does not deserve the re proach of monotony at all. By comparison with the later schools it is neither numerous nor stereotyped; it never sacrifices quality to the demands of mass production; and its inevitable failures are due less to carelessness than to the inability of some artists to cope with the formid able problems they set themselves. The few thousand bronze images that are still extant, plus the many more that have been lost, add up to a mere handful compared to the millions that have been made by later schools. Though the overwhelming majority of Sukhodaya statu ary consists of Buddha images, the sculptors proved their skill occasionally in other types ? Hindu divinities in bronze, subsidiary char acters of the legendary Life of Buddha in stucco, and so on ? which are outside the limits of the present article. (Cf. Fig. 14). As for the Buddha images, the deliberate leanness of the repertoire is a source of strength rather than monotony. Because of it, the religious energy is all the more concentrated; because of it, the variations between one image and another are all the more subtle. I have tried to show how the Thai of the old Sukhodaya kingdom evolved an art that was precisely suited to their requirements. Though they must have been sensitive to beauty, the patrons were not thinking of art in our sense. They needed supernatural protectors, which could be created only by following the rules of iconography as they appeared in the Pali texts. Perhaps there were some less superstitious pa trons also, deeply versed in the philosophy of Buddhism, who used images not as talismans but as artifices for contemplation. If there were, they might share the hesitation of the early Buddhists about the propriety of having images of the Master in human form at all; they might share the old fear ? which later events so richly justified ? that the ignorant would substitute the image for the essential and replace the Doctrine with a personal God ? or an idol. Such philosophers would know that merely human beauty is a snare that must be avoided; and they may have instinctively felt that the best way to avoid both the snare and the confu sion was to have the image made not really like 34</page><page sequence="43">a human being at all, but rather a combination of anthropomorphic elements with more ab stract symbols. And so, though the needs of these learned men were very different from the needs of the superstitious, they would lead to exactly the same sort of sculpture. The orthodox iconography, whether people thought of it as based on the real appearance of a God or as a help in following the doctrine of the great hu man teacher who had been Totally Extin guished, was in any case the same. But the rules of iconography did not cover matters of plastic style. Sukhodaya was not the direct inheritor of any single age-old stylistic tradition. When the artists meditated on their ideal, although they saw the iconography as it had been shaped in their minds by literature and older statuary, there were still many gaps that had to be filled in. In matters of modeling and facial expression, details of costume and the precise form of the flame that springs from the top of the head, they were not only free to be original ? they were almost forced to be. Here their own religious experience and their own taste were sure guides. For the great merit of the Sukhodaya image-makers is that while they were so true to the needs of their time they were fine artists and technicians as well. The sculpture of Sukhodaya could not pos sibly have been created by any other people. Yet it is strangely un-Siamese because it is un human. It has no place for the warm qualities that are so typical of the Thai people ? curi osity, ready friendship, hospitality, gaiety, zest ? any more than it has for recording their emo tional and everchanging countenance. Such qualities as these were left to painting. Sculp ture was reserved for the expression of more solemn feelings ? the simple man's desperate need of protection and reassurance, the phi losopher's need of resolution in his march to ward wisdom. In order to understand this art, our percep tion is compelled to make a double journey away from our familiar surroundings. First it must travel to Siam ? a distant country, indeed, but still a part of the earth, still a place peopled with human beings who are basically much like ourselves though formed in a different tradi tion. The second part of the journey is far more difficult, for it is no less than a departure from the world itself, along a unique route that be gins in Siam and leads into the unknown. FOOTNOTES 1.

Regarding the authorship of this in scription I have followed the opinion expressed in JSS XXVIII, 214 ff. ? A good many miracles of the sort described in the inscription have been reported in Siam. When I was at Lampang, in northern Siam, in January 1951, the local news papers reported that a relic enshrined in a tower in a local monastery had sprung out late one afternoon; shining with golden rays, it flew slowly around the top of the tower, where it was joined by other relics that flew in from elsewhere; then all of them continued flying clockwise around the tower for about an hour; finally the other relics flew away, and the relic that belonged in the tower re-entered its place. This miracle was witnessed by forty or fifty monks. But when I talked with the Buddhist Metropolitan of the region a few days later, he expressed some skepticism; he himself had never seen such a miracle, he said. Cf. the similar miracle reported by Hiuen Tsiang (Si-Yu-Ki, tr. Beale, vol. I, p. 66). 25. Coed?s, Recueil, 46. 26. For a rare instance of the use of stone, see section 5 and Fig. 21. 27. The only Sukhodaya statue I know of that bears a dated in scription is the Siva of Kambeng Bejra, which was made in 1510 ?long past the classic period. See Coed?s, Recueil, I, 157. Many attempts have been made to identify existing statues with statues mentioned in the inscriptions of various monarchs, or to date existing statues by reference to the date of the monastery in which they were originally installed. The results of these attempts are often plausible, seldom certain. 28. Cf. Notton, L?gendes, 35, for an exception more apparent than real. 29. Wells, 77 ff; cf. Renou and Filliozat, 575. 30.

See, for instance, Coed?s, Documents sur l'histoire, 119, with references. Cf. Coomaraswamy, Nature, 24. 34. "Buddha is sometimes said to be twelve cubits in height, and sometimes eighteen cubits." (Hardy, Manual, 364.) But those who tried to measure Buddha found it impossible. See Hardy, Manual, 365 f. According to traditional Siamese belief, based on Pali sources, Buddha's height was 18 cubits ? about 9 metres. 35. Cf. Coomaraswamy, Nature, 19. 36.

We have so little definite information about the Sukhodaya artists that there is no absolute proof that they used the trances. For routine productions, indeed, they probably did not. But their masterpieces cannot really be explained other wise than as the result of some such practice. Any great artist, whether in the east or the west, before undertaking a major work must devote a prolonged and attentive study to his subject; the Sukhodaya artist who felt such a need had a widely-recognized discipline available which was not only used habitually for a great variety of other purposes, but was also peculiarly well adapted to the religious and artistic requirements of image-making, as the Tantrik artists in the Pala period knew well. Since the whole tradition of image making at Sukhodaya derived ultimately from India, it seems likely that this important aid to inspiration would have been preserved; it must surely have been known to the Tantrik sculptors of Cambodia. And the image-makers of Siam still used it in the early 20th century, as I was recently told by Brah Deva Rojana, who was for many years chief sculptor to the Siamese Kings. Though he is now eighty-five years old, and long since retired, his mind is perfectly clear and he still takes pleasure in discussing his art. In his time, he said, many artists used "concentration" (samadhi). He himself regarded it as absolutely essential for making a really good statue. Beginners could use some "artifice" (earth, fire, etc., or even a Buddha image), but he himself had never found it necessary. For several days he would "observe the eight pre cepts" (abstentions of a pious Buddhist layman). Then he would sit with folded legs in the attitude of meditation and "empty his mind," at the same time controlling his breathing. He would "concentrate intensely" on the idea of a beautiful Buddha image. Presently the idea would enter through the top of his head, then descend into his breast and stomach. He regrets that today's image-makers no longer use this discipline, and thinks their work would be better if they did. But even today they still retain a formal relic of the usage, for they "observe the precepts" before making an important image, just as the Indian sculptors did before using the trance discipline. If we may believe the Annals of the North, the Sukhodaya sculptors also observed the precepts before starting their work (see Notton, L?gendes, 35). Is it not rea sonable to suppose that this observance was followed by samadhi, perhaps even by one or two of the initial stages of jhana? 41. A huge stone Buddha of Dvaravati style, now in the National Museum at Bangkok, comes from Sukhodaya. It is illustrated in LeMay, Concise History, Fig. 25 (where its provenance is given incorrectly; see JSS XXXI, 198). Perhaps this very statue was an object of veneration at Sukhodaya and con tributed to the formation of the style. Late Dvaravati bronzes have been found in many parts of Siam; some of them must have been available at Sukhodaya. The Mon kingdom of Haripunjaya (Lamp'un, near Chiengmai) remained inde pendent until the end of the 13th century, when it was con quered by the Thai. Its sculpture was an offshoot of the Dvaravati style. (See Dupont, Art de Dvaravati). As for Khmer Buddhas, and Buddhas of mixed Dvaravati-Lopburi style, their number is legion; they must have been well known at Sukhodaya. Perhaps the pious prince whose inscription I have already quoted from was writing about Dvaravati or Khmer images when he makes reference to stone statuary ? a reference that is otherwise puzzling in view of the great rarity of stone images in Sukhodaya style. When he was re pairing the "Monastery of the Great Relic" in the capital, he told his people to go and look for ancient stone images of the Buddha that were lying broken in the vicinity. "In one place a neck or a torso had been found; in one place the hair or an arm or the breast; in another place a detached head was lying far away from the body, and it took four men to carry it; in another place they had found a leg or a thigh, in yet another a hand or a foot. All these stone statues of Bud dha were of large size. They had to be put on barrows or carts to be moved to the sanctuary, where the pieces were put together with cement. . . . Once restored, they became large, durable, and extremely fine images of Buddha. Some of them 36</page><page sequence="45">were put in the sanctuary, others were set up in groups near by or ranged in the galleries." Coed?s, Recueil, 70; cf. LeMay, Concise History, 125. 42. There is no doubt that the Thai of Yunnan were skilled makers of bronze images. For proof it is only necessary to glance at their statuettes of Avalokitesvara. (See Chapin). According to history, they also made bronze Buddha images and colossal statues. (Ibid). But so far as I know none of these survive. The Avalokitesvaras are so different from Buddha images that a comparison is difficult; I cannot say, therefore, whether the old art of Yunnan exerted any stylistic influence on Sukhodaya. 43. Since the original lacquer has in most cases worn away, it is not certain that the marks on footsole, palm and forehead were always considered necessary. Certain marks that are usual in Walking Buddhas seem to have been regarded as optional in Seated Buddhas. See section 5. For the Pali list of Thirty-two Marks, see Rhys Davids, Dialogues, Part 2, 14 ff; Part 3, 137 ff. They are also given in Hardy, Manual, 368 ff, which gives a list of the Eighty Lesser Marks as well. Cf. Alabaster, 110 ff. For the "magic syllable," see below, caption to Fig. 25; cf. Coomaraswamy, Elements, 8 ff; also Boeles. 44. Below the three horizontal creases of the neck there is a semicircular line or ridge, which must be a stylized collar bone. Though it looks like the upper neckline of a clinging garment, it is obviously not intended as such, for that part of the flesh is bare, and in any case the line does not con tinue around the back of the neck. The artist is simply fol lowing an old convention of Dvaravati and Khmer art, which in turn had derived it from India. ? For the stereotyped similes of Sanskrit poetry and their use as guides in the silpasastras, see Tagore (contains excellent drawings). For further information on the silpasastras in Hinayana art, see Coomaraswamy, Mediaeval Sinhalese Art, 148 ff. Cf. Gangoly. I do not know of any direct evidence that the silpasastras were studied at Sukhodaya; but the inscriptions contain at least two references to the sastras in general. (See above, note 19). Besides the similes used as guides to anatomical detail, the silpasastras contain canons of anatomical proportion to be used for different sorts of statues, based on the "tala" (length of the face) and the "angula" (one-twelfth of the tala). (See Gangoly, 32 ff). The Sukhodaya Buddhas differ so much one from an other in anatomical proportion that it is hard to believe the artists used such canons ? unless they used several different ones, or merely regarded them as a guide to the beginner. I was anxious to know whether any such practises survived up to modern times in Siam, and in my recent conversation with Brah Deva Rojana I inquired particularly about them (cf. above, note 40). He himself, he said, had never seen any book of silpasastras, but had heard that Siamese versions of them did exist. But he had been taught the canons of proportion by his father, who had learned them from his father, and so on back ? all by word of mouth and direct example. In his own work he generally stuck pretty closely to them. The canons he had been taught were based on the k?p (length of the hand from the wrist to the tip of the middle finger) and the s?k (distance from elbow to tip of middle finger). For example: the distance from the chin to the top of the forehead, where the hair begins, should be one k?p; in a seated image, the distance from knee to knee should be one s?k plus one k?p. I asked him about the stereotyped similes (nose like a parrot's beak, hands like lotus flowers just beginning to open, etc.), but he had never heard of them. Yet it was obvious in his own work that there was some echo of these things ? presumably taught him by his father on the basis of older statuary and tradition, without direct reference to the similes. In the same way, he seemed to take little interest in the Thirty-two Marks; if he used some of them, it was because his father had told him they were essential to a beautiful image; he did not care about their mystical significance. 45. See Coed?s, Tablettes. 46. Certain late Khmer Buddhas have the flame; but these, I take it, are influenced by Sukhodaya rather than vice versa. The Patna Museum possesses bronzes from Nalanda and Bodhga ya displaying the flame; the Madras Museum and the Indian Museum at Calcutta possess Negapatam examples. (See Ashton, Fig. 331). For a Burmese example, see Ray, Sanskrit Buddhism, Fig. 2. For a Sinhalese example, see LeMay, Con cise History, Fig. 132. For a discussion of this feature in Sukhodaya art, see LeMay, Concise History, 118, esp. note 2; cf. Claeys, 414. 47. See below, note 77. 48. Even if the supernatural anatomy were subtracted, it would be hard to see at first glance that these statues have any resemblance at all in face or physique to Siamese human be ings. Certainly they are very unlike most of the people one sees in the streets of Bangkok. But most Bangkok Siamese today have a good deal of Chinese blood, whereas some country people are of much purer Thai descent. Among the latter I have often seen faces that strikingly recall those of the Sukhodaya Buddhas. The broad shoulders and narrow waists of the statues, and their smooth supple-looking limbs, are less remote from the Siamese physique than they are from the occidental. 49. In northern India, in ancient times, the robe ordinarily cov ered both shoulders; the right shoulder was bared only for certain ceremonies. See Foucher, Art gr?co-bouddhique, II, 270, 553, 705. In modern Siam the monk wears the robe cov ering both shoulders when he leaves the monastery, but covering the left only when inside the monastery. The ques tion of baring the shoulder or not baring it has been the subject of schisms that rocked the Buddhist church in differ ent parts of the world at various times. In Dvaravati art, both shoulders are more often covered. In Khmer art, seated Buddhas are apt to have the right shoulder bare, standing Buddhas both shoulders covered. In Sukhodaya art, during the high classic period, the right shoulder is bare; later, the standing Buddhas have both shoulders covered. (See sec tion 6). 50. The Pali names of the three garments (ticivara) are: waist cloth, antaravasaka; upper garment, uttarasanga; cloak, samghati. In colloquial language in present-day Siam: waist cloth, sabong; upper garment, civara; cloak folded as a scarf over the left shoulder, samghati. In looking at a Buddha image it is sometimes hard to tell whether the strip of cloth over the left shoulder is intended to represent the samghati folded and worn like a scarf as in Fig. 19, or merely a flap of the civara (upper garment) worn without the samghati as in Fig. 17. Sometimes, however, the flap of the civara is shown, ending in a fer-de-lance pattern, and on top of it is super imposed a folded samghati ending squarely. Often the pattern is more like a fish-tail than a fer-de-lance. 51. There are indeed a few bronze Buddhas of early date that are well realized in the round; and one of them ? which was dug up twenty-five years ago in western Siam ? seems to depict the Walking Buddha. See Coed?s, Excavations; LeMay, Concise History, Fig. 3. But charming as this statuette is, it does not convey any real sense of motion. For an interesting comparison with Indian sculpture of a totally different sort, cf. Ashton, Fig. 242. 52. Naturally this applies only to the bronzes ? and then only to the best of them. Many inferior bronzes present a quite un satisfactory silhouette if seen from the side or the rear. The Walking Buddhas in stucco are in high relief, attached to a slab. 53. The larger the image the more rippling the plastic quality may be. Contrast the rippling surface of the statue in Figs. 4 and 5, which is over 7 feet high, with the more simplified treatment of the statuette in Figs. 9 and 10. For the Khmer technique of carving the clay or wax model, see Groslier, 224. All the Khmer bronzes I have ever seen (except some very late ones which are themselves influenced by Sukhodaya) 37</page><page sequence="46">seem to confirm Groslier's theory in this respect. See, for in stance, the numerous plates in Coed?s, Bronzes Khm?rs. If the Sukhodaya artists, on the other hand, used true modeling to shape the clay, the image-makers of present-day Siam have inherited their technique (though not their skill), for they too use true modeling, almost as a European would. Pro fessor Feroci, the distinguished Italian sculptor who has taught for many years at the Department of Fine Arts in Bangkok and who has done so much to uphold the ancient Thai traditions, tells me he believes this technique is in herited from Sukhodaya, not imported from Europe. For an example of Dvaravati terra cotta that appears to be a work of true modeling, see LeMay, Concise History, Fig. 31. 54. The "compassionate kindness" of Buddha is of course a Mahayanist conception, not Hinayanist. But the religion of Sukhodaya must have been influenced by proximity to Cam bodia, where this very quality was so well expressed in the art of the Bayon. 55. Cf. Mrs. Rhys Davids, Book of the Kindred Sayings, 182, note 2. Sometimes the artist may have used the Four Ele ments successively as "artifices." Buddha images are in more than one sense compounded of earth, water, wind, and fire. In a material sense their substance is earth ? minerals dug from the earth, over a core of clay which is mixed with water; wind from the bellows has fanned up the fire that served the casting. But in another sense, while the substance is still drawn from the earth, the modeling has the fluid character of water; the image, capable of transporting the believer in trance to the wind-refreshed realms of heaven, is itself a Pillar of Fire. 56. See above, section 2. 57. Prince Bidyalankarana, Buddha's Footprints, 12. Coed?s (Tablettes, 159) gives a somewhat different interpretation. 58. Hardy, Manual, 211 f. 59. It was used from ancient Egypt to ancient China. For its significance in Vedic India, as well as in early Buddhism, see Coomaraswamy, Elements, 16 ff. Cf. Alabaster, Wheel, 245 ff; Prince Bidyalankarana, Buddha's Footprints. For an early use to mark a "conquest" in Cochinchina, see Coed?s, ?tats, 104. A friend of mine tells me that in Chiengmai, 40 years ago, before photography became popular, a person about to go on a long journey would ink his footsole and stamp it on a piece of paper, to leave as a reminder with his family dur ing his absence. 60. Coomaraswamy, Elements, 25 ff; Alabaster, Wheel, 245 ff; Foucher, Vie, 208 f. Cf. Coed?s, Collections, plate I. 61. Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th ed., s.v. "Adam's Peak"; Car penter, From Adam's Peak, 62 ff. 62. For a list of these, see Hardy, Manual, 367 ff; Alabaster, Wheel, 257 ff; Fournereau, Siam Ancien, 288 ff. 63. In case there should be any doubt on this point, it ought to be dispelled by a statuette now in the National Museum at Bangkok. Though this statuette is later than the Sukhodaya Buddhas (it is of Chiengmai style, and probably dates from the 16th century), its relationship to the Adam's Peak Foot print is equally clear. It represents the Walking Buddha "Impressing his Footprint" ? the pedestal being incised with the Footprint in three successive enlargements so as to make the meaning plain. 64. The famous Buddha Footprint near Sraburi in Siam was not discovered until 1602 ? long after the fall of Sukhodaya. Alabaster, Wheel, 253 ff; Prince Bidyalankarana, Buddha's Footprints. 65. Coed?s, Recueil, 89. 66. Coed?Si Recueil, 155. 67. Or very nearly. One of them, for instance, measures 1.54 metres; most of the other large ones appear to be about the same size. (See Fournereau, Siam Ancien, pis. XXI and LXVIII). The length of the Footprint on Adam's Peak is given as 5 feet 4 inches. (Enc. Brit., 11th ed., s.v. "Adam's Peak"). But in Siam there are plenty of smaller Footprints, which reproduce the "essence" not by measurement but by iconography. 68. The symbols are 108 in number, though at first glance they do not always appear so. Some of the individual frames may contain several symbols each. 69. Prince Bidyalankarana, Buddha's Footprints, 3. 70. See above, note 62. 71. Coed?s, Recueil, 127 ff. 72. Foucher, Art gr?co-bouddhique, I, 479; II, 324. 73. Coed?s, Tablettes, 147 f; cf. Foucher, Beginnings, 11 f. A great many of these tablets are copies of the Mahabodhi statue at Bodhgaya. 74. In the Indian reliefs all these positions appear, but a given position is not necessarily standard for a given Great Event. For instance, the Buddha Taming the Elephant sometimes seems to be Walking rather than Standing. In the votive tablets the four positions ? though they follow the same schemes as in the Indian reliefs ? may be put in a different context. For instance, except that the bowl of honey is absent, the Buddha Meditating under the Bo Tree may sit in exactly the same position as if he were Receiving the Monkey's Gift. 75. Foucher, Art gr?co-bouddhique, I, 560. 76. This formula was not nearly so popular at Sukhodaya as it had been in the Khmer schools of Cambodia and Siam. Cf. Dupont, Buddha sur Naga; LeMay, Concise History, Figs. 76-80, 86, 88; Coed?s, Bronzes Khm?rs, plates XXI and XXII. 77. This may be a convenient place to sum up my views as to the relative importance of the main components that entered into the Sukhodaya type of Buddha image. In the formation of the type, the strongest influences were the older images (Dvaravati and Khmer) and the Pali texts. Lesser influences were Sanskrit literature, small clay votive tablets (imported from India, Burma and Ceylon or else made locally in the same tradition), and an unconscious imitation of nature. In the continuation and development of the type, the strongest influences were the early Sukhodaya statuary itself and the Pali texts. Lesser influences were Sanskrit literature, images imported from Ceylon (and perhaps from India and Burma), and an unconscious imitation of nature. Since we have not been able to determine which is the earliest group of Sukhodaya images, my views as to the com ponents that went into the formation of the type are of course hypothetical, and it may well be asked why I make bold to say that direct imitation of Sinhalese images had no part in the formation but perhaps came later. I think it had no part in the formation for the simple reason that no Sukhodaya image really looks like any example of Sinhalese art; the Sukhodaya plastic style, and the type as well, must have been established without direct reference to it. The Sukhodaya anatomy, unlike the Sinhalese, is pro foundly influenced by the Pali texts, and considerably in fluenced by Sanskrit literature. The flame that tops the ushnisha has a different form from the Sinhalese, as though it were improvised from literature or travelers' tales or en larged from indistinct votive tablets. The Sukhodaya robe is always smooth and clinging, like Dvaravati and Khmer, in stead of corrugated with fine pleats as was rather more usual in Ceylon. The overwhelming majority of Sukhodaya Seated Buddhas perform the Earth-Witness gesture, whereas the great majority of Sinhalese Seated Buddhas perform the ges ture of Meditation. The Earth-Witness formula, rare in both Dvaravati and Sinhalese art, was quite popular among the Khmer. (It is exceedingly common in Bengal, Tibet, and Burma as well; but in those lands the legs are always in the "lotus position," rather than merely folded with one lying on top of the other as in both Khmer and Sukhodaya art). Details of this sort ? though none are absolutely conclusive ? could easily be multiplied. Finally, was it not natural for the first Sukhodaya sculptors to be much more profoundly 38</page><page sequence="47">influenced by the hundreds of Mon and Khmer images that they had seen and worshipped since childhood than by the insignificant quantity of Sinhalese images that might have been imported? On the other hand, there are definite similarities between Sinhalese and Sukhodaya art (in architecture as well as sculpture) ? similarities that are too strong to be put down merely to parallel draughts from the generalized fund of Indian artistic influence. Sinhalese statuettes, moreover, have been found in Sukhodaya sites. Were these not probably imported in the first half of the 14th century when ? as we know from the inscriptions ? religious contacts between the two centers had become frequent? They could not fail to have some influence; but since it was never really dominant the Sukhodaya type must have been firmly established before they arrived. It has often been argued that Sukhodaya art was pro foundly influenced by the statue called Brah Buddha Sihing, which the King of Sukhodaya was supposed to have gotten from Ceylon. (Cf. above, notes 23 and 32). Although the theory is tempting, it is rather a blind alley ? because that statue cannot be identified. There are three main claimants ? one in Chiengmai, one in Nagara Sridharmaraja, one in the National Museum at Bangkok; but none of them is of Sinhalese manufacture. The first two are not even copies of a Sinhalese original; the third, I think, is a northern Thai "copy," dating from the late 15th century, of a Sinhalese model. (See Griswold, The Buddha Images of Northern Siam, scheduled for publication in JSS in late 1953). Its prototype, long since disappeared, may indeed have had some influence on Sukhodaya art ? but that is mere speculation. In any case the influence of Ceylon was much more literary than plastic. It was long believed that the so-called Chiengsen school of northern Siam played an important role in the formation of Sukhodaya art. (See LeMay, Concise History, chapters VII - IX). But that theory rests on the assumption that the "Chiengsen school" rose before the Sukhodaya school. See Boribal and Griswold, Guide, 19. Since writing that Guide, my collaborator and I have come to the conclusion that it did not start until the latter half of the 15th century. (See Griswold, The Buddha Images of Northern Siam, to appear in JSS in 1953). Burmese art of the 11th or 12th century may have con tributed something to the formation or development of the Sukhodaya style, but it is not very evident. The tradition of bronze sculpture in Burma was not strong. In two or three elements of iconography Sukhodaya images resemble the bronze Buddhas of Negapatam in southern India. But the relationship is far from clear. Which copied them from the other, or did both copy them from Ceylon? In any case the Sukhodaya images do not really look any more like the Negapatam Buddhas than they do like Sin halese sculpture. In plastic quality there is little or no resemblance between them. The Negapatam Buddhas (or at least such of them as I have seen) are never larger than statuettes, and are artistically far inferior to Sukhodaya. Yet perhaps Sukhodaya owes something of its most re markable qualities to direct influence from South India ? its splendid bronze technique, its bold "realization in the round," its vigorous and fluid line, its supple modeling. All these things, which are lacking in the Negapatam Buddhas, are conspicuously present in many Dravidian images of the Hindu gods ? especially the "Dancing Sivas." Ceylon, of course, was in close touch with South India, and some Sin halese bronze images of Hindu divinities have similar qual ities (cf. Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art, Fig. 300, etc.). Some of the learned Brahmins of the Sukh odaya Court may have been South Indians. The Sukhodaya prince mentioned in the last paragraph of Section 2 brought back with him "a group of laymen" from Ceylon, who assisted in some of the building work at Sukhodaya (see Coed?s, Recueil, 71). This would account for Sinhalese influence on Sukhodaya architecture. (Coed?s, ?tats, 367). The group of laymen may well have included South Indian craftsmen. If so, their notions of Buddhist iconography would have been of little interest, but the sort of plasticity they had been accus tomed to give their Hindu divinities might well have appealed to the Thai as suitable for Buddha images. Although Sukhodaya was on friendly terms with China, and although in such matters as ceramics (Sukhodaya ware and Svargaloka ware) the debt to Chinese example is obvious, the influence of Chinese art on Sukhodaya sculpture is con spicuous for its absence. 78. Notton, L?gendes, 36 ff. 79. Cf. p. 23. 80. See Prince Damrong, Monuments, 42. But note that King Dharmaraja I, whom Prince Damrong identified as Rama Gamheng's grandson, has more recently been identified with Rama Gamheng's son. (See Coed?s, ?tats, 366, notes 3 and 4, and the article cited therein). 81. It is not clear whether or not the late school of Sukhodaya produced images of Buddha "in the attire of Royalty," such as were so popular in the Ayudhya school. I do not know the real provenance of the few images of this sort that are in the possession of the Royal City Monastery at Dhani and other collections within the limits of the old Sukhodaya kingdom. 82. The disappearance of the "scarf" in this case is logical and correct. For when the monk has both shoulders covered, he has neither a flap of the civara nor a folded samghati over the left one. Cf. note 50. 83. I leave out of consideration a series of bronzes, some of con siderable size, that fall well enough into the Utong style, though they were probably made at Sukhodaya. 84. Though the iconography of these images is so much like the northern Lion Type, I do not think they were imported from the north. First, because they were dug up at Sukhodaya sites; second, because there is usually something about the plastic quality or the pedestal that confirms their Sukhodaya origin. (For further information on the northern Lion Type, see Griswold, The Buddha Images of Northern Siam, sched uled to appear in JSS in 1953).

In a few well-known words (such as Bangkok, Chiengmai, Chiengsen, Lopburi, Wat) I have used the common spelling. I have also omitted diacritical marks on Sanskrit and Pali words. The list below gives the names as I have spelt them, but with the addition of the diacritical marks. In some cases I have added in parenthesis the Romanization according to a phonetic system which (without attempting to indicate the tones) approximates the Siamese pronunciation as follows: Vowels a as in father o as in dome ? similar but short ? as in moteur (French) e like a in fate 6 like aw in law ? as in pen ? like eu in chanteuse (French) ? like ea in bread u like oo in too i as in machine ? as in bull ? as in pin ? as in musique (French), or like ih in the ai as in aisle Wade system of Romanizing Chinese Consonants ch, ch', k, k', p, p', t, t' as in the Wade system, or as follows: ch a compromise between j in judge and ch in church, ch* as in church. k a compromise between g in goat and k in kit. k' as in kit. [aspirated]. p a compromise between b in boat and p in pit. p' as in pit. [aspirated]. t a compromise between d in day and t in top. t' as in top. [aspirated]. ng as in singing. s as in sit.
