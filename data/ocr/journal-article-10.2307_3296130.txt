<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNITY IN THE THOUGHT OF EMPEDOCLES A T THE PERIOD when Western scholars were alert to what appeared to be a growing gap between religion and science, the principal problem concerning Empedo- cles was the apparent dichotomy between the religious author of Purifications and the scientist who wrote On nature. The fact that for many of the fragments there could be no certainty which poem they belong to awakened the suspicion that the split might have been artificially widened, inasmuch as those who believed in it ascribed naturally to Purifications all lines with any religious implications and to Na- ture those which passed for pure science. Even so, most commentators took as estab- lished some discrepancy between the two and sought to explain it. Some offered the hypothesis that Empedocles wrote the poems at two different stages of his life, though they disagreed which poem repre- sented maturity as opposed to youthful enthusiasm or brashness. Others sought to see in Empedocles an example of the scientist who comparmentalizes his mind, working without God six days a week in the laboratory and praying in His Church on Sunday. Today it is generally conceded that the poems are not so incompatible after all. Three scholars in particular, W. K. C. Guthrie, in A history of Greek philosophy, and G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven, in The Presocratic philosophers, have demon- strated convincingly that there are many parallels both in language and content which bind together Empedocles' discus- sion of the nature and development of the physical universe and his theory of rein- carnation.1 I agree that there is every indication that Empedocles himself be- lieved that the poems dealt with two aspects of a total view. As Aristotle recog- nized,2 Love and Strife have for Empedo- cles a moral significance as well as motive power. It is Strife which brings about both the disintegration of the cosmic sphere and the fall of the individual soul. It is Love which makes the world grow round and evokes sexual desires in men and women. To grant that Empedocles intended that the two works complement one another is to assert the unity of his intention and of his artistic endeavor. Whether his philo- sophical system is wholly consistent is another matter. The problem of consistency, as I see it, falls into two parts. There is first the problem of the relation of deity to the cosmic cycle and second that of mortal to deity. We could put it another way by saying that we have an ultimate question and a relative one. What becomes of the "long-lived" or "immortal" god when this 1 Guthrie includes with his own interpretation of Empedocles an excellent critical evaluation of the work of other scholars in this area. In this short paper I have not thought it necessary to indicate where details of my attempt to solve the problem of unity agree with or differ from the ideas of others wrestling with the same problem. The views expressed are my own and not derived from others unless indicated. With regard to my over-all appreciation of Empedocles' system and Empedoclean scholarship, I am glad to acknowledge a major debt to Guthrie, as anyone must do who has read his unequaled discussion of this philosopher: A history of Greek philos- ophy (Cambridge 1965), vol.2, pp.122-265. 2 Metaphysics A 985a4.</page><page sequence="2">UNITY IN THE THOUGHT OF EMPEDOCLES 19 world separates out into the four elements under the influence of Strife? And what happens to a human being when he dies? These questions are related in that both ask whether there can exist in a material universe anything which is not mortal. They are respectively the problem of the 96EO and of the 8a'/oWv. Empedocles states precisely his position concerning what is perishable and what is imperishable. After explaining that all is composed of earth, air, fire, and water, brought together and pulled apart again by the force of those two other elements, Love and Strife, he declares, "&lt;In so far as they [the elements] have learned to grow into one out of many&gt; and then when the one has split apart, to turn into many once again, they are subject to be- coming and have no everlasting life; but in so far as they never cease from their interchanging, they are inviolate in the cycle."3 The elements themselves are im- mortal, the forms they assume are mortal. Later in the same fragment Empedocles says emphatically that besides these six elements, "nothing comes into being nor ceases to be . . . no, only these exist; but running through one another, they become now some things and now others and yet remain always the same." Thus Empedo- cles can simultaneously point to the im- permanence of all forms of existence and yet declare that birth and death are but names which people use. All this seems clear enough. Yet since ancient times there have been two divergent types of explanation, the extreme forms of which I call, for the sake of convenience, Atomist and Neo-Plationist.4 The pas- sage which I have quoted could, as far as immortality is concerned, satisfy Epi- curus. The material substances of which the universe is made up are indestructible, but the shapes which they form are ephem- eral and without ultimate significance or purpose. That specific particles or por- tions of elements may once have been joined to form a particular individual means no more in the way of meaningful permanence than the fact that bits of hydrogen from Cleopatra's corpse may fi- nally make their way to water drunk by Napoleon. Yet if we consider the nature of these elements, it is at least compre- hensible that the Neo-Plationists should have thought they detected an underlying monism in the Empedoclean kosmos. Em- pedocles gives the names of deities to the four elements, and he treats Love and Strife as something far different from the qualityless atom. All the elements are sentient. The portions of any one of them sense the presence of their like in other parts of the kosmos. Everything, not living things only, is said to have some sort of sensation and even thought. When Love unites the four elements into a sphere, Empedocles speaks of it as a god. And there is something darting through the whole of things which he calls a "holy mind." These factors leave room for a theology, though I am not myself willing to go so far as to postulate a monism. Let us look first at the problem of OE8d. In Fragment 132 Empedocles says: "Happy is he who has obtained the wealth of divine understanding (OEorW 7rpar80owv). But wretched is the man whose care is for a shadowy opinion about the gods." Cer- tainly Empedocles is contrasting his own true knowledge of deity with popular su- perstition. I doubt that he is merely com- paring his eternal elements or the divine sphere with the gods of anthropomorphic mythology. Empedocles explicitly provides for OEOL' who live in some blissful state apart from men. Indeed he announces that he himself is on the verge of becoming one of them. The goal of becoming a 0Ed' is the motive for practicing the purifica- tions. 3 Fr.17. The bracketed line has been put here by Diels to fill an obvious lacuna. He has lifted it from Fr.26, which says the same thing in slightly different words. 4I use "Atomist" and "Neo-Platonist" descriptively rather than referring to specific members of either school.</page><page sequence="3">20 HAZEL E. BARNES What are these divine beings? At least we know what they are made of: the same elements as everything else. Empedocles says (Fr.21): "For out of these [elements] come everything which was or is or will be. Trees sprang from them and men and women, beasts and birds and water-nur- tured fish, and the long-lived gods highest in honor. For these alone exist and run- ning through one another they take on many forms." We may note that here and in comparable passages Empedocles speaks of "long-lived" rather than "immortal" gods. It is only when he is obviously being metaphorical that he uses "immortal"; for example, when he refers to "being hearth and table companions with the other immortals." The word diOvaro3 need no more be a problem here than the idea of gods with literal hearths and tables. I personally find these gods no obstacle to the doctrine that all things are perishable in their form and reducible to the elements. To us standing at the far end of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, the idea of a deity long enduring but not everlasting may seem a contradiction in terms. It is the usual thing in the philosophy of India, which must certainly have influenced the Orphic and Pythagorean sources of Em- pedocles, however indirectly and remotely. In the monist philosophies of the East, the gods are reabsorbed in Brahman at the end of each kalpa or cycle. In this setting, to be sure, the multiple deities, like all else in the world of maya, are in reality one even in their seeming differentiation. In the dualist systems-for example, Jain- ism-deity is but one of the lower stages in the journey of the jiva toward its final goal of total isolation from matter. The transmigrating soul is believed to move upward and downward in the cosmic scale, from inorganic structures through plants and animals, gods and demons, as well as to sample the various states of man. Such thinking seems akin to Empedocles' state- ment that he had fallen from a higher state, that he had been born both as girl and boy, bush and fish, and was now, at the highest level of the human species, for all practical purposes, already a &amp;6o'~. It seems to me highly probable that the Atomists' concept of the gods may have been suggested by Empedocles. As their deities were composed of more stable but finally perishable combinations of atoms, so, I believe, would Empedocles' gods be a closely blended harmony of the four elements, with Love temporarily binding them so closely that they could resist the influence of Strife until the end of this phase of the cycle. Thus the state of the OEO' would be roughly comparable to that of the virtuous souls of the later Stoics, who enjoyed an individual immortality until the final reabsorption of the kosmos in the logos-fire; except that for Emped- ocles the disintegration under the in- fluence of Strife is annihilation of the particular consciousness, not its expansion. We may conclude that this use of OEO' is not inconsistent with Empedocles' physical theory. There is, of course, still the ques- tion of the holy mind and of the sphere, which Empedocles referred to as 0Ed6.5 But before we take up these special aspects of the problem, let us consider the Satov. Empedocles' explanation of human phys- iology and psychology is thoroughly naturalistic. The language may at times be a bit bizarre and some of the conclu- sions naive. In intention he is as scientific as Democritus. Quantity and arrangement of the four elements produce differentiated structures and qualities. Love and Strife function in somewhat the same way as our contemporary physical principles of at- traction and repulsion. Thought (vdro'a) is-or is found especially in-the blood which is round the heart. In general we think especially with the blood (7w aLt'arL AkXLTrra OpovEtv), for in the blood "the elements are more closely blended than in other parts." Everything seems to point to the conclusion that consciousness is an epiphenomenon dependent upon the union 5 Aristotle, Metaphysics B 1000b3.</page><page sequence="4">UNITY IN THE THOUGHT OF EMPEDOCLES 21 of the elements which compose the body. Yet there is also something which allows Empedocles to use the pronoun "I" when he talks of his various incarnations. There exists a Saltowv which has fallen from afar and which after death will go from this body to some other earthly or heavenly existence. It is at this point that scholars who argue that there can be no reconcilia- tion between Empedocles the scientist and Empedocles the religious prophet find their strongest argument. We must admit that there is no conclusive evidence to prove them wrong. Those who have recently presented the strongest case for the unity of Empedocles have faced up to the fact that they must attempt a hypothetical solution. Kirk and Raven argue that the 8almowv is a tiny clump of Love which endures intact and self-conscious as it goes from one body to another and finally to the oEd6, that it retains its individual identity until it is ultimately absorbed with the rest of Love in the divine sphere.6 I cannot accept this theory. It suggests that Love is the anti- thesis of the material; but we cannot possibly make its opponent, Strife, the equivalent of matter. It is Strife which breaks everything apart. Futhermore, Love when at the height of its power is inex- tricably mingled with the purely material elements. The one time when Love is concentrated in itself and apart from the rest is when Strife is in control. Guthrie's proposal is entirely different. He claims that Empedocles, like the Pythag- oreans, believed that there are two souls in man. One is the psyche, which is simply the conscious life resulting from the union of elements in the specific body; the other is the 8altwov, which is independent of these elements. Guthrie suggests that the Saltoiv is a separated portion of al0'4p, a different element, which anticipates the quintessential element later developed by Aristotle. This atO4p is contaminated by or at least imprisoned in corporeal matter until, by dint of purifications, it ascends to the vast eternal reservoir of alt4p in the upper heavens.' Guthrie is almost certainly right in ascribing this kind of belief to the Orphics and Pythagoreans. We cannot assign it to Empedocles unless we admit that he abjured his metaphysical theory right when it was most important. Even for a seer who learned gradually to be a philosopher, to adopt Guthrie's magnificent description of him, this is too much. If we hold to the idea that Em- pedocles felt it important to achieve a unified view of all reality, we cannot have him introducing a completely new element to provide a destiny for a soul which is not composed of those six elements which, he has said, account for the existence of everything. I am convinced that Empedocles would have insisted that the Sal&amp;tov too was com- posed of elements. I admit that we cannot possibly prove the fact or show for certain how it could be true. I do believe that there are indications in the fragments which help us see how some obvious diffi- culties might have been overcome. Objec- tions to the corporeal nature of the 8alcwov might be (1) that it could not exist apart from the body in which it dwelt; (2) that it would have to be visible or tangible, or both, which seems contrary to common sense; (3) that one cannot imagine a corporeal al4wov moving from body to body, let alone becoming a god. None of these arguments appears to me fatal. We should recall that Empedocles speaks of Love (and presumably Strife as well) as having length and breadth. If Love is somehow a material element, the idea that the 4aliwov is so would hardly be impossible for Empedocles. Even air is neither visible nor tangible, but the klep- sydra experiment proved that it occupied space. Empedocles' theory of vision, which -as with all of the life processes-was based on the belief that like attracts like, 6G. S. Kirk and J. E. Raven, The Presocratic philos- ophers (Cambridge 1964), pp.358-60. Guthrie, vol.1, pp.313-14; vol.2, pp.261-3.</page><page sequence="5">22 HAZEL E. BARNES called for the simultaneous occurrence of two things: the outward movement of ele- mental substance from the eye and the eyeward movement of effluences from the object.8 Yet no bystander could observe anything corporeal moving through the air! Empedocles' belief that thought is found especially in the blood near the heart does not mean, I am sure, that thought is blood without further qualification. Whether he speaks of Love and Strife, sense percep- tion, or thought, Empedocles postulates the existence of something which either is material or can exist only by means of the material elements but which does not have any of the properties of matter in the way we ordinarily conceive of it. Most specifi- cally, it is neither tangible nor visible, al- though its presence and effects are keenly realized. I conclude that the Saltov was a tenuous union of elements, closely harmonized by Love and able for the duration of our present world to retain a self-identity while moving up and down in the scale of living things. How it got from one body to an- other is no more a problem for Empedocles than for those who hold that the soul is Love or aiO4p or an immaterial spirit. Per- haps Empedocles is even in a slightly better position to explain it. Since the Saltwov is a union of elements, the law of like to like would continue to hold. In the thousand years allotted to it between incarnations,9 the 4alwLov would find its way to that combination of elements to which it felt most akin.10 Since it is, like all elemental unions, subject to the dis- ruptive attacks of Strife, the careers of individual 8altuoviE would vary--by both necessity and chance, as Empedocles liked to say, much to the dismay of Aristotle. I have not forgotten the divine sphere and the holy mind, nor the possibility that they may represent a different sort of problem from that of the long-lived O8ol. Three fragments are particularly impor- tant. Fragment 29 describes the shape of reality when all-powerful Love had driven out Strife and held the rest of the elements tightly together in a ball. "Two branches do not spring from his back; there are no feet, no nimble knees, no generative geni- tals; but it was a sphere and everywhere equal to itself." Fragment 134, which Ammonius quotes to describe Empedocles' idea of the nature of a god, begins almost precisely the same and then ends unexpect- edly: "He is not provided with a human head upon his body; two branches do not shoot forth from his back; he has no feet nor swift knees nor hairy genitals. But he was [or 'became': b rAero] only a holy, ineffable mind, darting through the whole kosmos with swift thoughts." Finally, Fragment 133 says: "It is not possible to reach the divine and set it easily before our eyes nor to grasp it with our hands." If we consider these statements without trying to force upon them our contempo- rary concepts of mind and deity, I think we may safely draw these conclusions: First, the remark about the impossibility of grasping the divine with our eyes and hands does not say that the divine is immaterial or nonelemental, but only that it is invisible and intangible. Second, the parallelism between the description of the sphere and that of the divine must be deliberate and significant; the difference in the lines which follow indicates that Empedocles is not identifying the sphere, which is itself the kosmos at that stage of the cycle, and the god whose thoughts dart through the kosmos. Finally, I think that we ought to look at these fragments in the light of Empedocles' insistence on three other ideas-that everything is composed of elements, that the elements are sentient, 8There is a difficulty in understanding Empedocles' theory of vision precisely, but it is certain at any rate that the combination of inward and outward movements forms the basis of sight. Again I find Guthrie's discussion most thorough and persuasive. 1For discussion of the length of time involved, see Guthrie, pp.251-4. 10It is, of course, impossible to know at what point the 6alAwov enters the body or embryo. It would seem most natural that it should be breathed in at the moment of birth.</page><page sequence="6">UNITY IN THE THOUGHT OF EMPEDOCLES 23 that consequently the entire world of na- ture possesses thought and sensation. If we do so, then perhaps we may postulate a parallelism in all parts of Empedocles' thought, even beyond that indicated by Guthrie and by Kirk and Raven. Let us begin with the sphere. Here, with Strife expelled, Love holds the four ele- ments together by penetrating them through and through, keeping them in perfect bal- ance; hence the circularity. The elements would be wholly intermingled, not distrib- uted in four equal sections; otherwise Strife would effect the same result. The expression "equal to itself" may well have more than spatial implications. The sphere would be a great mass of harmonious self-awareness -divine thought; for the elements, far more than in the human blood, would be exquisitely blended. No wonder that Em- pedocles declared his sphere to be divine even though doomed to repeated disinte- gration. In the second stage, our own, the kosmos is differentiated, but the world is still spherical in form.t" This kosmos is an inferior parallel to the divine one. But where the elements remain most finely blended, there is swift darting thought-- the holy mind. I doubt that this holy mind should be equated with the OEoPd which Empedocles aspired to become; I think it resembles rather the sentient god- world of Xenophanes. Finally, in our- selves there is the thought in the blood which comes where Love most tightly holds the elements together. Contrary to the view that would separate this thought from the 8a wv, I believe it is the presence of the Saltov which, acting by the principle of like to like, effects the harmony of corporeal particles which in turn makes possible what we call knowledge. This weak equivalent of the holy mind has fallen by the influence of Strife and through the practice of shedding blood or eating animal flesh. Empedocles obviously does not want us to attribute the latter to the 8alEwv in its original state as if some god grew tried of the menu of nectar and ambrosia at the celestial tables and yearned for steak instead. The charge of bloodthirstiness applies to and explains the fall of mankind from an earlier Golden Age of human life. But we may say that under the influence of Strife, the Sal'wov allowed itself to yearn for the greater sep- aration of elements which resulted in the existence of the short-lived mortal. In the third stage of the cycle, when all the ele- ments have been separated out, there is no blending at all, hence no thought, but only random motion, until Love begins to draw the world together once again, mov- ing toward the rebuilding of the perfect sphere.12 I do not claim that this interpretation makes Empedocles a greater philosopher. Those who believe that soul and thought must be entirely other than corporeal or who find it impossible to conceive of gods which do not survive our structured uni- verse may feel that Empedocles' consist- ency is the source of his failure. I am firmly convinced, however, that it is such notions on our part that have created the problem of unity in his thought and that Empedocles meant what he said: that out- side the elements nothing ever was or is or will be. The structures they enter into, including the &amp;80E and the Sal'wov and the holy mind, perish; it is only the elements which endure forever. This is the final triumph of matter, if you like, but of a matter not inert and dead but perpetually active and curiously alive. HAZEL E. BARNES University of Colorado 31 Guthrie argues (vol.2, p.190) that it was more likely egg-shaped. He quotes Aetius 2.31.4 as evidence and seems inclined to follow him rather than the doxographers, who held that the present kosmos for Empedocles was a sphere. The precise degree of roundness scarcely affects my argument. 12I favor the view that under Strife there is always some movement, though the problem of whether the third stage involves motion or absolute stillness is debatable.</page></plain_text>
