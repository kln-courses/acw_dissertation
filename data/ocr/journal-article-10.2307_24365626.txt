The family fled, she via Vienna, Prague and Berlin to Hamburg. On the boat to Hull, she tended her seasick future husband, with whom she later had four children. One day, Grandad went out for cigarettes, and never returned. Early rumours sug gested he left for Dublin. In 1999, Brandes retraced his grandmother's journey, up through north-eastern Romania, near the Moldovan border, although he never reached her home village. From Cluj, the ancient capital of Transylvannia (bristling with restive local ethnicities: German-speaking Saxons and Hungarian sepa ratists), he travelled to Budapest just as NATO was bombing Belgrade, and Serbian refugees streamed into the city. He has since made other solitary journeys; feeding such nervous, fragmentary reportage into an outright fiction, The Last Travelogue of Albert Sitzfleisch. The surname means, liter ally, 'sitting meat' or buttocks (the pejorative Nietzsche applied to Marcel Proust), but it also connotes a sense of stodgy Prussian perseverance. Brandes' Sitzfleisch is a state less flaneur ghosting European resorts or obscure shrines like the site of Walter Benjamin's suicide in 1940. Such vignettes appear as splintered flashbacks in Sitzfleisch's mind as he mysteriously plunges from the top of the Deutsche Bank in Hannover towards certain death. The Travelogue, in 'slide show' form, now graces eight digital monitors in the Illuminations Gallery in NUI Maynooth. The images emerge from Brandes' recent digital collages, twelve of which he scaled up to billboard size last May for the grounds of Norwich Cathedral: postcards from Sitzfleisch's meanderings from Fitzrovia, through the Sorbian region of east-central Germany to the Ligurian Riviera, where a flotilla of destroyers nestle in the bay. From the 'diary entries' which adorn the images, Sitzfleisch emerges as a bewildered, irascible, faintly unsavoury gent on a nightmarish 'Grand Tour': holed up in survivalist mode in the Hampshire hills, while 'neighbours tramp the gardens in night-vision goggles'; attending conferences in palaces like 'Tyrol's most exclusive health spa', whose 'corridors boast looted artworks'; shuttled in coaches between Zagreb and Krakow; surfacing blearily in hotel breakfast rooms ('The room is full, backs bent over soup plates.'); and enduring hideous entertainment ('Tommy Cooper tribute acts' or 'air guitar karaoke'). He is plagued by anxieties about 'unrest in the Alps and riots in Bruges', dodgy internet coverage and whether he remembered his mosquito repellent (Figs 4&amp;5). For all Brandes' deflating humour, the imagery is sinister, melodramatic: buildings in gothic conflagration (May 9th: Hotel Shushashin); or in January 2nd Nowa Zestrojenie, his Royal Scots cavalryman reappearing, like a favourite toy sol dier, atop his rock pedestal, apocalyptically dwarfing a damp-looking coastal caravan camp. The aesthetic is mostly retro-futuristic, shades of early 20th-century German/Russian Dada which hint darkly at European history, yet distractingly, Brandes' trademark dates arch 25th WINTER 2014 I IRISH ARTS REVIEW 95</page><page sequence="5">ARTIST CIVIC DISTURBANCE For all Brandes' Ozymandian take on such edifices, the commanding scale of his recent pieces carry their own almost dictatorial power. He similarly deflects resonances behind his Self-Portrait (as a fictional character) at the National Self Portrait Collection (Fig 2). Troubled by an emerging likeness to his father, he took inspiration from a NKVD mugshot of the great Jewish Russian writer Isaac Babel, shortly before the latter's execution in 1940. Brandes appears in profile, topped by his surname in Cyrillic and his PPS number, in an unsettling reminder of repressive state control. Brandes also appears in the Hugh Lane Gallery's current curatorial flourish, 'Phoenix Rising', marking the centenary of Dublin's utopic 1914 Civic Exhibition, inspired largely by Patrick Geddes, the Edinburghian biologist, geographer, sociologist and pioneering town-planner; and featuring an exhibit by Hugh Lane called Futurism in Dublin. Chaired by Lady Aberdeen, and run by the Civics Institute under the banner of the phoenix, this sprawling, long-forgotten event was an appeal to civic virtue and urban regeneration, and hosted international planners such as English garden cities proponent Raymond Unwin. The resurrected phoenix - variously symbol of Christ and, since Fenian times, of Irish (and Catalan, Greek, even German) nationalism - provided a rallying symbol for numerous enlightened causes, and the show was attended by over 110,000 in a Dublin awakening to labour rights, women's suffrage and the scandal of abject poverty - just as Europe descended into total war. In a bombastic satire of empire, Brandes' huge glowering wall-piece reprises his horse-mounted trooper (Fig 8), his birdlimed Busby absurdly magnified like a bunch of bananas. He poses atop a mausoleum; its hot neon sign announcing 'Through Work and Vigor/Virtue, I will Rise Again from the Fire', before a hybrid city skyline of Dublin, Edinburgh, Norwich and Reading. Brandes also created an orphen art piece, which the gallery have mounted around Dublin (Fig 3), transplanting Reading's monstrous Maiwand Lion IN A BOMBASTIC SATIRE OF EMPIRE, BRANDES' HUGE GLOWERING WALL-PIECE REPRISES HIS HORSE-MOUNTED TROOPER, HIS BIRDLIMED BUSBY ABSURDLY MAGNIFIED LIKE A BUNCH OF BANANAS and red lettering - which recall Soviet anniversaries - are Monument (commemorating the 1878-1880 Afghanistan purely arbitrary: 'I'm conscious of the weight of history campaign) into a Dresden sunset; behind a cheesy, photo behind these elements, but I almost ignore it, using them as opping committee of scabrous potato-heads, props to create stage settings.
