<plain_text><page sequence="1">I892] The Formal Principle of the Reformation. 31 THE FORMAL PRINCIPLE OF THE REFORMATION. By Rev. F. W. C. MEYER, New Haven, Ct. The tenet which makes the Bible the seat of authority in matters of faith and practice worked as a leaven in Christen- dorm long before the day of Luther and of Calvin. Protests against unscriptural church practices set Southern France into a state of fermentation as early as the ninth, the eleventh, and especially the twelfth century of the Christian era. We need only be reminded of the premature efforts of Ajobard of Lyons, the Phre Hyacinthe of Louis the Pious' cycle, and of the bold commentator Claudius of Turin, or, later on, the revolutionary reform movements, headed by Peter of Bruys, Henry of Lausanne and Arnold of Brescia. With less commotion than the last-named trio, Peter Waldez, a wealthy citizen of Lyons, inaugurated the well-known Waldensian movement. Attracted by the rich spiritual treasures hidden in a Latin Bible, Waldez had the Four Gospels translated from it, and, later on, other parts of both Old and New Testament. The Vulgate began to realize its name and become a popular book. Especially did the pious peasants of the Piedmont valleys delight in having God speak to them in their sonorous vernacular. Lenau, in his epic " Die Waldenser," alludes to a diatribe between a Romish emissary and certain Waldensian brethren. Said the Pope's ambassador: "Well, I agree with you, my friends, that ill practices prevail. Still, the church remains the only means of salvation. To use an illustration. Here is an only brook that flows over the carcass of a hog. The herds pasturing near it must needs have water. So they drink from the brook, however putrified its water may be, do they not?" "iAh yes," rejoined the Bible-loving Waldenses, " but we prefer to get our water beyond the carcass." And go directly to the fountain-head they did, until the church, unable to check the supply of living water, dispersed the ardent drinkers. The weapons of persecution-forever suicidal in the hands of</page><page sequence="2">32 The Formal Principle of the Reformation. July-Aug., an ecclesiastical body-tended only to spread the movement into adjacent countries. An under-current of new religious feeling issued forth and marked the channel for the ship of Reformation to steer and speed in. During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the rejuven- escence of classical studies brought eminent scholars into closer contact with the Greek and Hebrew originals of sacred writ. It was the fashionable occupation of learned men to read the minuscules and deride the monks. Moreover, the first efforts at something like a grammatical-historical method of interpretation were then advanced. Although of little immediate result, the small stone, which centuries afterward developed into a mountain of universal opinion, was loosed and set a rolling against the doctor-hooded image of dialecti- cal scholasticism. In England John Wycliffe vigorously emphasized the sole authority of the divine will as laid down in Sacred Scripture, and proclaimed it the basis for all true theology and expedient measures of reform. Luther later on pronounced the scholarly Englishman " too acute" to become popular. Still the Loll- hards-as Wycliffe's itinerant disciples were nick-named- went Bible in hand from district to district, and, persecuted at home, disseminated their master's views abroad. Wycliffian tracts ignited the hearts of men like Huss and Jerome of Prague, whose fervid antagonism against anti- scriptural Rome outblazed the fire of the stake. ,"To-day you fry a goose, but out of its ashes there shall arise a swan, which you will not be able to fry," is the prophecy placed in the mouth of the dying Huss, whose name is the Slavonic for goose, while the swan, to which he is alleged to refer, ornated Luther's coat of arms. These movements antedate the sixteenth century, but are inseparably linked with the Reformation. The German, Swiss, French, Dutch and English reformers found the formal principle formed and formulated as it were. It was their chief task to extricate from the book, loosed of its chains, the material principle of justification by faith. Nevertheless, both formal and material principle are aptly joined as twin sisters of Reformation travail. Their mother was the church,</page><page sequence="3">1892] The Formal Principle of the Reformation. 33 which had so grossly deviated from the Scriptural standard as to make a return toward it inevitable. Protestantism is always born of something to protest against. The outward- ness of Romanism was flagrantly opposed to the inwardness of Christ's teaching. The reformers found the latter urged in Scripture and verified in their personal experiences. So they dropped away from the supremacy of the church and fell back upon the final authority of Scripture. Whether the same method of procedure that in the Contra-Reformation resulted in the ex cathedra infallibility of the Pope, on the Protestant side led to a rigid and unscriptural view of the indefectibility of the Bible, need not be here discussed. Let us briefly review sixteenth century and subsequent history of the working out of the formal principle. You know how it came about that, the two-edged sword, wrested from the church, not only dealt a grievous blow at Papacy, but also divided the Protestant body. Luther, the first hero to brandish the new weapon, took a conservative stand. He insisted that only those practices of the Romish Church must needs be abolished which were anti-biblical, by which he meant contra-evangelical. Upon this broader basis he allowed the national church to grow up, albeit the question of a church of regenerate believers was duly considered at Wittenberg. To bring one great and fundamental phase of religious truth irresistibly to bear upon Christendom was the great reformer's chief concern. And how this end steadfastly in view caused him to regard por- tions of the Bible, not corroborating his purpose, as epistles of straw, is known to all. The Bible was to him supremely authoritative, inasmuch as it contained the experienced truth of salvation by faith. It need hardly be added that in his view of Scripture the Augustine monk was not a literalist. One might proceed to show at length how the German Bible declares its bold translator no scrupulous transliterator. Of course, like every preacher, he would make most of the literal rendering of any passage in support of his particular view, as the ill-fated disputation with the Zwinglians concerning the Lord's Supper obviously puts forth. "This is my body," the furious combatant wrote within a circle, and all the 3</page><page sequence="4">34 The Formal Principle of the Reformation. [July-Aug., argumentation on the other side could not make is equal signifies. Rank literalism? Nay! Fully in accord with the conservatism that will not allow the Catholic doctrine of tran- substantiation to assume any more radical form than that of consubstantiation. Numerous instances might be mentioned, but upon what grounds closer adherents to the formal princi- ple disagreed with Luther is already manifest. The Reformed Church drew the lines somewhat closer. Zwingli and Calvin maintained that all practices not deducible from Scripture, were to be refuted. Still the venerable theologians of the Reformed creed chose rather, in the minds of some, to brood over the eternal mysteries of the Godhead than approach the Jordan with Bible in hand; or they were more desirous to pry into the election chamber than enter with open eyes a primitive meeting of the Church at Corinth or Antioch. And so dissenters, clinging tenacionsly to the formal principle, kept on disagreeing. Open-eyed Bible- readers established denominations of their own. The seed of separation bore hundredfold. Factions, gendered by the impulse to regard what they see in the Bible as authoritative, are still multiplying. The witty French scoffer who re- marked, ' England had forty different religions but only one kind of sauce," perhaps did not count all the religious parties when he visited the isle a century ago. For the last General Registrar's report credits England and Wales with two hundred and fifty-one denominations. Here surely is some- thing which suggests mending. The unifying power of Christianity seems hampered by the very principle upon which all Protestants agree. And furthermore, it cannot be denied that there has been a tendency since the Reformation to make the Bible an end of faith rather than a means of salvation. "1To believe every word of the Bible just as it stands " has been the high- est ambition of devoted Protestants. " If the Bible said that two times two are five, I would believe it," the writer recently heard an earnest Christian avow. Prominent pastors assert: ",This volume is the writing of the living God; each letter was penned with an almighty finger; each word in it dropped from the everlasting lips; each sentence was dictated</page><page sequence="5">1892] The Formal Principle of the Reformation. 35 by the Holy Spirit." That kind of pulpit utterance leads some listeners to what has been termed " Bibliolatry," and the worship of its letter is a penalty the Bible has had to pay for being made so all-important a factor in the Reformation. Yet after looking at the apparently unfavorable side of the subject, nobody will disregard the inestimable amount of good wrought by the principle in comparison to which all evil is insignificant. As that Spanish ship, returning to her port from the first voyage ever made around the world, was prophetic of the course the Book then for the first time printed should pursue; so was the vessel's name, "Victoria," indicative of the world-wide triumph of revealed religion. The Book in the hands of the millions-let them regard it as a talisman dropped from heaven or a thesaurus containing profitable instruction-has done and is doing what classical libraries have never accomplished. Any penalty the formal principle pays ought therefore only to be considered in connec- tion with the grand results it reaps; a universal spread of Scripture and the moral and spiritual enlightenment of man- kind following. Prof. Ladd, after careful examination of the subject, stated that the most bigoted age concerning views of the Bible is the one from the Reformation on and now terminating. He laid a certain stress upon ",bigoted." The essayist would like to emphasize " terminating." We have already crossed the threshold of a new, more sensible and more biblical Bible era. Nor is this era so new that even the tardiest conserva- tive need dread innovation. Ever since August Hermann Franke and his colleagues at Leipzig thought it a needful and profitable occupation to spend Sunday afternoon in read- ing the Greek and Hebrew Scriptures and the " Collegia Philobilica" was organized, which remained not without in- fluence upon men like Ernesti, father of the present historical- grammatical method of interpretation, the new era has been ushered in. For the beneficent light of Day One in this creative period, all Bible readers feel exceedingly grateful. Much traditional darkness and dogmatical arbitrariness have been dispelled by that method of interpretation which asks for genuine historic light on Hebrew modes of thought and</page><page sequence="6">36 The Formal Principle of the Reformation. [July-Aug., diction. Anthropomorphic representations, poetical extrava- gances and popular though unscientific allusions, embarrass the Bible student no longer. Another stage follows. From the depths of textual analy- sis the vapors of higher criticism ascend. In Europe Day Second has reached high noon. In America the conservative slumberer is aroused by flashes on the Eastern horizon. Maybe it will turn out a day of morning and evening and vapory confusion! Yet dry facts are appearing, diluted fancies receding, truthful methods of studying the Bible germinating, and a Fourth Day of luminaries shedding sun- light on many biblical questions can be looked forward to. Whether this light prove the Old Testament to be the classic literature of a uniquely religious people and the New Test- ament the documentary heritage of incipient Christianity-no more, no less-remains for critical analysis to elucidate. We dare not frustrate the results of earnest and honest investiga- tion. By the principle espoused we are led to search the Scriptures for all they contain even at the risk of relegating cherished views to the history of the past. And we ought to be willing at any time to substitute The Bible for Our Bible. Our Bible must contain the Bible. All readily concur in that statement, whether or not they agree that our notion of the Grand Book must be enlarged to admit popular traditions clothing great religious truths, unquestionable literal inac- curacies as well as highest literary merits, evident incongru- ities alongside of trustworthy representation, in a word various traits of human imperfection marking while not marring the message of divine Perfection. Adherence to the formal principle-that is the point the writer is after-must lead thoughtful men to make their conception of Scripture wide enough for anything and everything the Bible actually contains. But what are some of the present methods of ascertaining the correct view of the Bible and its principal truths going to lead us to? Whereas the tenet of Ernesti, that the exegesis of Sacred Scripture must be subjected to the same historical and grammatical rules as other literature, has been universally accepted, it does not follow that the Higher Critics have</page><page sequence="7">1892] The Formal Principle of the Reformation. 37 established so scientific a rule for their procedure. Higher Criticism as yet is largely subjective and lacks a defined basis. But will its positive results not prove fatal to the principle under discussion? By no means. All it can do, as has ever been the case, is to make it difficult to believe in the Holy Scriptures, without believing in the Holy Spirit. To the spiritually-minded reader, whether critical or uncritical, the Bible will ever reveal itself as a body quickened by the vital magnetism of righteousness and pulsating with the life blood of redemption. A comparison with the religious literature of other ancient people's will prove the production of the God led Hebrew race unique. As men go to Greece for Art and Rome for law they will keep on looking toward Judea's hills for the sunrise of a pure religion. ",We cannot dispense with the sun because it rises in the East," Kurmmacher once ejacul- ated in a sermonic discourse: allowing whatever you will for the Oriental narrators idealization or Hebrew peculiarities and linguistic limitations, the volume is indispensable as an ethico-religious classic, to say the least. And many readers find themselves getting at more nutritious than classical roots by digging deeper into the unparalleled volume. Trans- ferring the Semitic into Japhetic-by a process of expansion, where it be necessary, or condensation, whenever required- preacher's involuntarily make the heartstring of spiritual listeners vibrate. There is much that transcends experi- mental religion in the Bible, men say, and, strange enough, they always grapple after the transcendental. But there is so much which touches and tunes the innermost part of human nature, though seemingly ignored alike by reasoning critic and metaphysical theologian. Examples of divine inspiration may be solicited from the hieroglyphics of Egypt or the cuneiform inscriptions of Assyria, deduced from the religion of Buddha or the ethics of Confucius, appear in the philosophy of Plato or the morals of Seneca, be manifest in English letters or in German song -inspiration may be proved to be an international prerog- ative. But with the Jews, whence salvation comes, the ex- amples are not sporadic, but connected and organic. Lange's</page><page sequence="8">38 The Formal Principle of the Reformation. [July-Aug., affirmation seems not ungrounded: " Sacred Scriptures, not- withstanding the differences and variances of writers, time, form and language, constitute a unified, complete and organic a whole, as if they had flowed from one pen, sprang from one fountain-head in a year, in a moment." The biblical writers were all of them carried by the self-same breeze from on high, and perhaps cared less for securing a straight line in the wake of canonical literature than steering in the channel of salvatory purpose. And it is each and every writer's pur- pose that signalizes the unity of the whole. Above all, the Bible will ever be regarded essential to Christianity from the very fact that it culminates in the unique historical figure of the Christ. What odds, if defects in the frame necessitate scholars to make more of the un- equalled picture! If Peter deny the verbal inspiration or the sole authority of an infallible ipse dixit, but confess upon un- impeachable historical grounds that Christ lived and that His work was not ended with His last breath upon the cross, what cock will crow? It has forever been made impossible for a pontiff, like him before the Reformation, to conduct his friends through apartments resplendent with treasures and flippantly remark: " How lucrative this fable of Jesus is!" For with the full assurance of that German scholar, Christians can confront any skeptical Bonaparte by saying: " Sure if you doubt the existence of Jesus, I, after twenty-five years shall doubt that Napoleon lived." The life of the Christ rests upon historical evidence, all the more trustworthy since the New Testament accounts have been subjected to severest criticism and manifestly do not coincide in every particular. " Other foundation can no man lay " than is laid, which is- the Bible? the Church? Christian consciousness? Nay, " Jesus Christ," inseparably connected with all three wherever they are real. The need of building upon this choice and adamant foundation, gold, silver, precious stones of spiritual life, rather than wood, hay, stubble of abstruse speculation, is as keenly felt to-day as in the apostolic age. It is the correct understanding of the Scriptures which urges that. And it is the formal principle which bids the Church as well as each individual believer correctly understand the</page><page sequence="9">1892] 39 Scriptures. Whatever demands for modification, therefore, may beset the tenet that the Bible is the seat of authority in matters of Christian faith and practice, we are thankful that it points out the necessity of a biblico-circumferential view of Scripture and a christo centric rest of faith.</page></plain_text>
