<plain_text><page sequence="1">Forum As a regular feature of Religion and American Culture, the edi- tors invite scholars to comment from different perspectives upon an issue or a problem central to the study of religion in its American con- text. This FORUM format is designed to foster the cross-disciplinary study of religion and American culture and to bring to the readers of the journal the latest thoughts of scholars on timely, substantial top- ics. Contributors to the FORUM are asked to present brief essays or "thought pieces" instead of carefully documented articles. Religion and American Autobiographical Writing During recent seasons in the academy, much scholarly atten- tion has been directed toward the dynamics and behaviors of particu- larly interesting congregations, the character of apparently typifying communities over short spans of time, the continuities of the denomi- national traditions, and other comparable studies concentrated on the social or group dimensions of religion in America. Many of these en- deavors have provided important data and interpretations of the ways some carefully selected and thoroughly studied "group life" can yield senses of broader patterns and more general critical accounts of American religious existence. At the same time, such emphases seem to have veered attention away from the possibilities that can issue from studies of personal experience and sensibility. In favor of the concern to decipher various forms of religious "collectivity," many cur- rent studies might well be neglecting those individuals who have made up this or that religious-social collective, who have proved distinc- tively different within it, or who have stood as clearly alternative to it. In a culture whose nature and mythos clearly celebrate, among other things, the singular man or woman, the freedoms of choice, even the liberties of personal self-making, it would seem im- portant not to lose sight of how individual self-understanding and self-expression provide what is perhaps a different kind of evidence about religion in American culture than the group studies, given their agenda, can bring to the fore. For this reason, the editors have em- ployed the thinking of four scholars known for their work on differ- ent forms of autobiographical writing (journals, diaries, personal es-</page><page sequence="2">2 Religion and American Culture says, memoirs, and the like, including autobiographies per se). Because of their concerns to see how individual and personal lives appear and operate in the complex religious-cultural matrices of America, these scholars have been asked to take up the question of the kind of "evi- dence" for the study of American religion disclosed by way of such texts expressive of individual experience and outlook, to reflect on the kinds of interpretive circumspection required for approaching such evidence, to consider the bearings of this autobiographical testimony on the findings of the studies of groups and traditions, and to ponder in general the contribution to critical inquiry into religion and Ameri- can culture that might follow from the study of American autobio- graphical writing. SUSAN JUSTER The personal testimonial of faith was perhaps the first and certainly the most enduring form of American expression. From seven- teenth-century Puritan conversion narratives-scrupulously recorded in private journals and public church records according to rigorous narratological and doctrinal formulas-to the spontaneous, unre- hearsed testimonials delivered by ordinary men and women during the outdoor revivals of the First and Second Great Awakenings, the spiritual autobiography has been the cornerstone of evangelical Prot- estantism in America (arguably the most powerful religious tradition in the nation) for three centuries. These stories of self-transformation convey a drama as old as the Bible in terms as changeable as the reli- gious landscape itself. The basic story-the journey from sinner to saint-has remained the same: individuals are first struck down in terror as they realize the enormity of their sins and then raised high in transcendent joy by the overwhelming grace of God. But the emo- tional inflections, the circumstantial details, the salience of social cate- gories of identity such as race and gender, and the larger political significance of this basic psychodrama have differed widely from generation to generation. Sometimes terror is the predominant motif, other times love; sometimes the encounter with God and the devil is painfully physical, involving the body and all its senses, other times disembodied and allegorical. Sometimes the sinner's social identity is wholly dissolved in the experience of grace, fulfilling the scriptural promise that "in Christ there is neither male nor female, slave nor free"; other times, individuals confront their past and pledge their fu- ture as social beings, as men and women who occupy distinct racial and class positions in American society. Sometimes the experience of grace threatens the social and political order of the day, as when con-</page><page sequence="3">Forum 3 verted Africans dared to preach freedom to their masters or when poor men declared themselves the social equals of the gentry class in colonial Virginia. Other times, conversion affirms the prevailing or- der, as when men at the turn of the twentieth century were urged to use their spiritual power to become better businessmen and civic leaders, while women were encouraged to fulfill their domestic natures. When committed to print, these testimonials of faith pro- vided a literary blueprint for the evangelical ethos and, perhaps, as Sacvan Bercovitch suggested more than twenty years ago in The Puri- tan Origins of the American Self, for the American republic as well. Cap- tured by diaries, memoirs, journals, private letters, and, occasionally, by the more formal conventions of the autobiography, the transforma- tion of self experienced by evangelical converts was a radical experi- ment in personal and social disintegration and reorganization-one that Phyllis Mack has suggestively compared to the poststructural assault on the unified, centered subject. Like postmodern adepts, evangelical saints believed that the self was an unstable entity, a social construction whose integrity could not withstand the "acid of self-criticism," as Mack put it (Visionary Women: Ecstatic Prophecy in Seventeenth-Century England, 1992, 7). Once this acid had been applied and the personality (sometimes even body) of the unregenerate saint dissolved, what lay exposed to the withering gaze of the Spirit was, of course, nothing less than the soul-a category for which modern the- ories of subjectivity have no equivalent. If we can put aside, for the moment, this fundamental difference, I think the parallels between the conversion experience and poststructural theories of the self are both real and analytically useful, and I would like, in this essay, to ex- plore several questions that arise for me from the juxtaposition of modern literary theory with the texts and practices of the evangelical tradition: what constitutes the self, and how do male and female un- derstandings of the self differ? Where does epistemological authority reside for early modern and modern saints: in the human body (and if so, where in the body-in the heart? the brain? the senses?), in the soul, or outside the individual, in the will and power of God? What is the relationship between language, experience, and power among the converted? And how have the answers to these fundamental ques- tions about identity and agency differed across time and space? The most basic of these questions, what is the self, is also the most problematic. Take first the question of authorship: when saints record their conversion experiences, who is speaking? Sometimes, narratives are written in the first voice, sometimes in the third, some- times by another party altogether (the minister of the congregation, a</page><page sequence="4">4 Religion and American Culture relative, or close friend). Even when the voice of the narrative is the first-person "I," it is not always clear that she is speaking for herself; the trope of the saint as the vessel of Christ, the passive mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit, is a recurring motif in early American spiritual auto- biographies, especially in those recorded by women. The "I" of the text is thus an unstable entity, whose identity can shift several times in the course of the narrative from the individual to the divine. Since this authorial indeterminacy seems to have been more a feature of wom- en's than men's spiritual memoirs, the question of interpretation for feminist scholars has been whether this division of self empowered or disabled evangelical women. On the one hand, to speak with the au- thority of God was a tremendously powerful position, lending legiti- macy to women's words. On the other hand, the erasure of the self from the text reinforced prevailing cultural stereotypes of women as passive and submissive to masculine authority. A number of works, some theoretical and some historical in approach, treat this question of the subjectivity of women's spiritual writings: for example, Chris- tine Krueger, The Readers' Repentance: Women Preachers, Women Writ- ers, and Nineteenth-Century Social Discourse (1992), Ann Braude, Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth-Century America (1989), Felicity Nussbaum, The Autobiographical Subject: Gender and Ideology in Eighteenth-Century England (1989), and Jean Humez's intro- duction to Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson, Black Vision- ary, Shaker Eldress (1981). On the whole, I tend to favor the former interpretation, espe- cially in regard to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century spiritual ac- counts, where the fracturing of the personality in the conversion ex- perience was not a social aberration, a sign of individual weakness or pathology (as it might have been construed later in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries), but entirely consistent with the early mod- em understanding of the self as a social fabrication. If the newly con- verted saint did not speak with the authoritative "I" of post-Enlightened society, neither did most of her unregenerate neighbors; only when the evangelical model of selfhood (with its emphasis on the disinte- gration of the sensual and cognitive faculties) began to diverge from the models of human personality touted by medical and legal author- ities, I would argue, was the deconstructive dimension of the experi- ence of grace potentially debilitating for women. Once we have unraveled the thorny problem of authorial identity, however, we have only begun to address the question of how evangelicals understood the self. Grace came in many forms for American evangelicals. Some experienced it as a quickening of physi- cal sensations, as a heightened sense of smell or taste, or as a jolt of di-</page><page sequence="5">Forum 5 vine energy flowing through the arteries and limbs of the body; some experienced more a rush of feeling, an overflowing of the emotional reservoirs of love and joy. Others spoke of the meditative quality of grace; still others of its ability to "loosen the tongue" and liberate the voice. Each of these models of grace-the somatic, emotional, intellec- tual, and linguistic-carried different implications about where to lo- cate the source of human identity, since the premise of the conversion experience was the destruction of the core self and its reconstruction under the healing power of the Spirit. If grace came through the body, as a jerking of the limbs or convulsive laughter (the famous "laughing exercise" of antebellum camp meetings), the somatic nature of identi- ty was highlighted. If grace was achieved through contemplation, as the comprehension of divine laws or scriptural truths, the intellectual dimension of identity was instead prioritized. If grace was conveyed by language, as an overcoming of silence via the liberation of the tongue, then one's humanity was defined primarily by the ability to speak. These were not exclusive propositions, of course, and evangel- icals (like most people) understood human identity to be multifac- eted, to lie in the unique combination of physical, mental, and emotional resources that together make up a person. But the emphasis varied from time to time, and, in this variation (I would argue), we can trace the shifting history of theories of subjectivity from the seventeenth century to our own day. My own account of this history would go something like this: while the revivals of the eighteenth century introduced a new physi- cality into the conversion experience, bringing to the surface of the body the passionate emotions that had always constituted the essence of grace but which earlier saints had preferred to bury in the recesses of the heart, the medical and pedagogical reforms of the early nine- teenth century eclipsed the somatic quality of grace and emphasized instead the opening of linguistic channels between God and man. As the human body became ever more contained and constrained by the Victorian preoccupation with decorum and cleanliness (the resurrec- tion of the "classical" body with its closed surface over the "gro- tesque" body with its porous boundaries and multiple orifices, as Bakh- tin might have phrased it), the scope for bodily displays of religious ecstasy correspondingly narrowed. In the face of this widespread cul- tural assault on the human body's receptivity to the effluvia of the ex- ternal world, nineteenth-century evangelicals devised new strategies for communion with God that emphasized language: witness spiritu- alism's fascination with alternative modes of communication, from spirit photography to seances to trance speaking. The simple declara- tion of the Shaker founder Ann Lee, "I am Ann the Word," at the close</page><page sequence="6">6 Religion and American Culture of the eighteenth century speaks volumes about the transformation of the epistemic center of religious authority from the body to language. However achieved, what did saints do with the newfound powers that grace conferred? Did women whose tongues were liber- ated speak authoritatively for social and political reform, or did they limit their exhortations to the family circle? Did men whose passions were liberated form intimate connections with other men that defied their culture's strictures against homosocial bonding, or did they dis- card these bonds of fellowship in the competitive world of commerce and politics? Did saints who found physical release in the extravagant bodily gestures of conversion feel an affinity for the enslaved Chris- tians in their midst, for whom physical models of spiritual ecstasy were part of the legacy they brought from Africa, or did they seek to distance themselves from a degraded association with African Amer- icans that their faith threatened to compel? To answer these types of questions requires that we make some assumptions about the rela- tionship of religious conviction to the world outside the meeting- house. How far did the experience of grace go in circumventing, if not entirely dissolving, the worldly relations of men and women? Evan- gelical claims to the contrary, there was often an unbreachable gulf be- tween the spiritual aspirations of the converted and the realities of ev- eryday life that required saints to take up again the social identities they had so eagerly discarded in the heat of a revival. There is pre- cious little evidence, for instance, that the concept of racial fellowship held any sway outside the evangelical congregation in the slave South-and perhaps little sway inside, as masters routinely escaped censure by the evangelical churches for mistreating (let alone owning) their slaves who were, after all, presumably members of the same mystical body of Christ. (For slightly different readings of the evan- gelical commitment to racial egalitarianism in the South, see Mechal Sobel, The World They Made Together: Black and White Values in Eigh- teenth-Century Virginia, 1987, and Sylvia Frey, Water from the Rock: Black Resistance in a Revolutionary Age, 1991.) Women, too, may have gained some measure of spiritual authority from the evangelical insis- tence on the equality of all souls, but rarely were they able to use that authority to challenge patriarchal control outside the church-even if some did use the power of grace to chip away at the margins of their social confinement by agitating for reform (for two discussions of the opportunities and constraints facing evangelical women who sought to exercise spiritual authority within their religious communities, see Susan Juster, Disorderly Women: Sexual Politics and Evangelicalism in Revolutionary New England, 1994, and Christine Leigh Heyrman, Southern Cross: The Beginnings of the Bible Belt, 1997).</page><page sequence="7">Forum 7 The fact that narratives of spiritual triumph over the wages of sin were committed to print and widely circulated, however, meant that the evangelical promise of self-transformation continued to beckon ordinary men and women despite such limitations. Per- haps the best example of the liberating potential of the conversion story comes from slave narratives of the antebellum era, in which the path toward freedom was described as a spiritual journey. The liberation of the soul and the liberation from bondage were insepa- rable in these texts, which functioned to marry the evangelical mes- sage of personal redemption to the political aspirations of an entire people. Individual bondmen and women may not have been able, with rare exceptions, to use the evangelical promise to free them- selves or call their masters to account for the cruelties of the slave system, but, collectively, the power of the salvation drama provided crucial textual support for slave rebellions in Virginia in 1800 and again in 1831 and in Charleston in 1822. The lessons of Nat Turner's bloody rebellion and Denmark Vesey's aborted slave conspiracy were not lost on white evangelicals, who rushed to impose new re- strictions on autonomous slave worship in the aftermath of these episodes. In light of the well-established link between evangelical religion and slave insurrection, the continued use of the trope of spiritual liberation in the narratives of ex-slaves well into the nine- teenth century takes on a more politically charged (or more sinister, in the eyes of white slaveholders) meaning. (On the connections be- tween slave religion and rebellion, see James Sidbury, Ploughshares into Swords: Race, Rebellion, and Identity in Gabriel's Virginia, 1730- 1810, 1998; Donald Mathews, Religion in the Old South, 1977; Michael Mullin, Africa in America: Slave Acculturation and Resistance in the American South and the British Caribbean, 1736-1831, 1992; and Vin- cent Harding, There Is a River: The Black Struggle for Freedom in Amer- ica, 1981.) Ultimately, we are left with questions about the role of evan- gelical models and texts of conversion in transforming self and soci- ety that tantalize but can never be answered. If we take seriously the evangelical claim to create a new personality, to alter the nature of the self through the traumatic experience of the new birth, then we are in a better position to assess the personal and social consequences of this religious tradition in American history. If not quite true poststructur- alists in their appreciation of the artificiality of social identity (there is that nagging problem of the existence of the soul), evangelicals none- theless exhibited an astute and disconcertingly modern understand- ing of the self as a fundamentally unstable entity. We have much to learn from that insight, whatever our own personal beliefs.</page><page sequence="8">8 Religion and American Culture JOHN D. BARBOUR Generalizations about autobiography's contribution to the study of religion and American culture are difficult because of the be- wildering variety of forms of writing about the self. In addition to tra- ditional autobiographies that view the chronological course of a life- time from a relatively stable position, many forms of writing describe a limited period of the author's life or, like a diary, document succes- sive moments from different perspectives. Our survey should encom- pass testimonies, captivity narratives, jeremiads, public appeals to conscience, confessions, interviews, apologias, explorers, journals and travel logs, slave narratives, poetic "songs of myself," utopian ex- periments, autobiographical fiction, nature writing, memoirs of pub- lic careers, accounts of conversion and deconversion, documents re- cording the founding and functioning of institutions, and many other distinctive genres, each of which often veers away from the presenta- tion of the self to address other concerns. The dimensions of religion for which this literature constitutes evidence are equally various: for- mative childhood events, rituals of marriage and death, ethical stan- dards and dilemmas of conscience, understandings of the symbolic meaning of America or American civil religion, apprehensions of the divine in the natural environment, interreligious conflicts and influ- ences, patterns of change within denominations and organized groups, individual psychological development, theological beliefs and doubts, and many other religious phenomena. These diverse autobiographi- cal forms and various aspects of religion require appropriate ap- proaches, and each yields distinctive insights. I suggest three ways in which autobiography seems to me of immediate and vital interest in understanding religion in America and conclude with reflections on some issues that should arise in any approach to autobiography. Autobiographies have great significance for current discus- sions of individualism, its religious dimensions, and its beneficial and deleterious effects on American life. The sustaining myth of modern autobiography and the ideology of American individualism converge in their faith in each person's capacity for autonomy and self-creation. Autobiography celebrates the value of the singular individual and usually expresses the conviction that persons can shape their own destinies. Such writing epitomizes the "self-seeking" in our demo- cratic and egalitarian society that is variously characterized as cre- ative, convention-defying, anarchistic, narcissistic, centrifugal, or oblivious to common values and concerns shared by Americans. The negative side of individualism, scrutinized at least since de Tocque- ville, has been most compellingly criticized recently by Robert Bel-</page><page sequence="9">Forum 9 lah's team in Habits of the Heart and by communitarian critics. The ten- sion between an autobiographer's search for individuality-for uniqueness, eminence, and autonomy-and his or her search for com- munal or covenantal solidarity with others is deeply embedded in our classic texts. (Individuality is not exactly the same as, but has af- finities with, what Bellah calls "expressive individualism.") Benjamin Franklin, for instance, recommends his table of vir- tues as a way to become successful and wealthy, seemingly reducing ethics to calculated self-interest. Yet, he founds and nurtures many in- stitutions that contribute to a healthy community: a hospital, fire- fighting and fire insurance companies, a library, a university, scientific societies, Philadelphia's municipal services, and the political charter of the young nation. Thoreau retreats to Walden Pond to hoe his beans, listen to loons, and march to the beat of a different drummer. Yet, this seeker of solitude challenges American thinking about a whole range of social issues, including the nation's economic prac- tices, attitudes about the natural environment, the individual's right and duty to political and moral dissent, and the implications of such events as the coming of the railroad and the exploitation of Irish im- migrants. At the heart of contemporary autobiographies, too, lies a tension between the drive toward the discovery or invention of a sin- gular life, which to Americans often seems to be possible only by breaking away from a community of origin, and the desires for soli- darity and commitment, for contributing to the lives of others, and for the nation to realize in practice its ideals of justice. Jewish and Chris- tian religious values shape both the impulse toward individuality and that toward community, and analogous ideals and conflicts may be discerned in Native American traditions and world religions as they adapt to conditions in this country. Autobiography provides concrete examples of how persons from different religious traditions have sought to reconcile the claims of individuality and community. Autobiography illuminates the many ways in which religion and race have been related and shaped American life. In the land where democratic ideals stress that personal identity is largely a mat- ter of individual achievement and aspiration, people of color have reminded the nation of how much one's destiny is defined and deter- mined by ascriptions of race. Much of the nation's greatest autobio- graphical writing is closely tied to reflections on the role of race in American history. The two most original and distinctively American forms of autobiography, the Indian captivity narrative and the slave narrative, are both preoccupied with matters of racial self-definition and link these concerns to religion. Slave narratives criticize the use of Christianity to uphold slavery and invoke a standard of authentic</page><page sequence="10">10 Religion and American Culture Christian faith to condemn slavery, even when, as in the case of Fred- erick Douglass, the author is ambivalent about Christianity. The slave narrative is the prototype for countless stories of liberation from other forms of social injustice based on class, racial, religious, or gendered identity. Like Puritan confessions and conversion narratives, slave narratives demonstrated how to use biblical stories, especially the Ex- odus events, as the basis for interpreting personal life while also being easily adaptable to secular outlooks. Autobiographical occasions of self-definition and self-assertion in the face of racial prejudice have deeply influenced our literary and religious self-consciousness and remain a paradigm for many writers. Stories of captivity by Indians helped Puritans to define their identities in the new world, describing a test of faith and justifying the conquest of Native Americans by the agents of Western civilization. Captivity narratives, which continue to influence popular culture (see Gary Ebersole's Captured by Texts: Puritan to Postmodern Images of Indi- an Captivity, 1995), are the most distinctive of the many autobiogra- phies that delineate personal identity through contrast with the char- acteristics of another group. The most interesting works of this sort are marked by ambivalence: while often defensive and self-justifying, they also reveal the author's yearning for a wilder, freer, more authen- tic life and a more nurturing community, which white settlers have discerned or projected onto Native Americans and other marginal- ized groups, especially people of color. Race and ethnicity are also central in many immigrant autobiographies and in works by the white males of traditional religious and literary canons. How writers conceive of what is normative or mainstream in their culture and what is deviant or marginal reveals a great deal about religious and moral values. The senses of identity and alterity are reciprocal, re- flect the culture's deepest values, and are best comprehended as they shape the form of narratives. This is true in every society; what is dis- tinctive in America is the way norms are linked to race and the impor- tant role of autobiography in confirming and contesting outsider and insider status, as well as in revealing what these notions really mean in practice. A focus on the relationships between cultural values and racial identity in autobiography yields knowledge about the styles and forms of self-expression, the formation of character, and the rich gumbo of religious influences in the United States. A third religious topic to which autobiography contributes insights is the search for healing that so preoccupies many Americans as to become the center of their spiritual life. The root meaning of sal- vation is healing. Insofar as autobiographers seek to be healed, they raise the implicitly religious issue of what constitutes not simply good</page><page sequence="11">Forum 11 health but a good life, even when a person must endure chronic suf- fering or a painful death. The "death and dying" movement helped elicit an enormous number of autobiographies dealing with grief, mourning, and the search for religious consolation, some of which are surveyed in Lucy Bregman and Sara Thiermann's First Person Mortal (1995). Specific illnesses spawn distinct autobiographical literatures, such as "cancer journals" and "AIDS memoirs," which are analyzed in Thomas Couser's Recovering Bodies: Illness, Disability, and Life Writ- ing (1997). A powerful recent narrative is Nancy Mairs' Ordinary Time (1993), a collection of essays describing the author's experience of multiple sclerosis, her husband's cancer, and her continuing struggle to be both a Catholic and a feminist. Equally compelling is Terry Tem- pest Williams' Refuge (1991), which recounts the death by cancer of her mother and grandmother and Williams' reflections as a threat- ened survivor of the "clan of one-breasted women," women exposed to nuclear testing in Utah during the 1950's. Williams sorts out her ambivalent relationship with Mormon tradition, seeks solace in the natural cycles of Utah's bird sanctuaries, and concludes by depicting "soul-centered and strong women" protesting nuclear testing in Ne- vada. For both Mairs and Williams, and for much of the most vital contemporary writing, questions about gender identity are at the cen- ter of the quest for a more meaningful spiritual life. Their descriptions of illness lead directly to a critique of American cultural values and to reflections on which religious resources sustain or fail them through physical and psychological suffering. These works disclose problems or weaknesses in conventional religious responses to sickness and death. The search for healing usually means not only the hope to cure disease but also yearning for a fuller, more authentic life. Reli- gious concerns become central insofar as an autobiographer docu- ments illness in order to find meaning in the body's vacillations and suffering and to come to terms with finitude and death. The many first-person stories of "recovery" from various kinds of abuse, addic- tion, or exploitation show affinities between contemporary autobiog- raphy and the genres of self-help books and popular psychology. The publication of a personal narrative dealing with illness or disability functions as a secular ritual of healing, overcoming the stigma associ- ated with such problems and reasserting some measure of control over one's life. Such writing discloses the significant though often in- choate and vague expressions of "spirituality" in contemporary America (as when someone tells me, "I'm not religious but I'm spiri- tual"). This literature cries out for both the insightful interpretation and the thoughtful critique of scholars of religion. In sum, I find auto-</page><page sequence="12">12 Religion and American Culture biography to be helpful in addressing these three areas: the relations between religion and individualism, race, and healing. What can only be learned from autobiography, as opposed to other sources for the study of religion? The editors' introductory questions suggest consideration of the relationship between general pattern and particular instance, between the group and the individu- al. Autobiographies need to be understood as both representative, or typical, and as singular, unique, idiosyncratic. Scholars need to make generalizations about Orthodox Jews, Methodists, or charismatics, and autobiographers themselves are much concerned with the char- acteristics of groups. But the most interesting works, the ones that I want to teach and write about, are not simply representative of a type. They are not "case studies" or illustrations of what is already known from other sources. The great works-by a Frederick Douglass, Dor- othy Day, Thomas Merton, Malcolm X, or Maxine Hong Kingston- reveal a struggle with formative myths and religious communities and a unique mixture of affirmation and dissent in relation to various aspects of a tradition. They also explore how religious traditions be- come confusedly entangled with many other dimensions of human experience. Kingston, reflecting in The Woman Warrior (1975) on her Chinese-American "talk-stories," asks, "How do you separate what is peculiar to childhood, to poverty, insanities, one family, your mother who marked your growing with stories, from what is Chinese? What is Chinese tradition and what is the movies?" The student of autobi- ography should be interested not just in the author as the epitome or representative of a single tradition but also in how that individual re- flects many distinct influences and networks of relationship among cultural groups in America. This perspective can help guard against the danger of taking all Native American history to be epitomized by Black Elk Speaks or thinking that Malcolm X narrated "the black expe- rience of America" or that Dorothy Day represents all Catholics. (A helpful teaching strategy, reflected in the organization of Gary Com- stock's textbook Religious Autobiographies, 1995, is to pair autobiogra- phies so that students see both commonalities and differences be- tween two members of a tradition.) My response to autobiography is incomplete if I do not consid- er the limited but significant and fascinating capacity of individuals to gain a perspective on the groups that have shaped them and to engage in assessment, conscientious judgment, and critique of their traditions. This is an essential religious dimension of autobiography: as a writer examines her life, she discerns the influences of various elements of her culture and affirms or challenges them. This normative assessment of the cultures forming the self reflects both moral and religious formation</page><page sequence="13">Forum 13 and self-transcendence. My interest in this dimension of autobiography reflects the conviction that persons can apprehend the limits of their freedom and, through this understanding, achieve a greater measure of freedom. A sceptic, or a scholar concerned only with the sociological or theological dimensions of religion, might ask: why should we focus on the individual's capacity for change, discern transcendence temporally in a person's relation to the past, and value this as much as a person's contact with what lies beyond the self, whether the influence is of hu- man groups or the divine? From some theoretical perspectives, my ap- proach replicates the ideology of individualism and masks the deter- mining role of cultural institutions that script our stories and ourselves. Does the self write its story or is it "written" by collective discourses? My approach to autobiography reflects my involvement in the culture that creates autobiography, including both Christian values and typi- cally American beliefs about individual freedom. Thus, the study of au- tobiography engenders self-critical awareness of one's own values and assumptions about religion. What do other approaches to autobiogra- phy reveal about the scholar's values? We should consider autobiography not simply as document- ing religion in the author's past but as itself a religious act. To use the examples discussed earlier, writing an autobiography may have reli- gious significance as an author tries to reconcile needs for autonomy and community or to discern how racial perceptions and tensions have been related to religious values or to find healing, even when all else has failed, in the bonding power of storytelling. Autobiography needs to be examined as an expression of religious impulses and aspi- rations at the time of writing as well as in terms of what it reveals about the author's earlier experience and formative culture. Autobi- ography is not simply a description of religious events in the author's past, but itself represents a profound religious action: an attempt to discern the role in one's life of God, or whatever is considered ulti- mate, and from this perspective to reorient the values of author, read- ers, religious traditions, and American culture. GARY COMSTOCK The tantalizing invitation from the journal's editors suggests that contributors to "Religion and American Autobiographical Writ- ing" might wish to give some thought to whether a subtle shift has oc- curred in the Religious Studies academy-a shift from creeds to sto- ries, groups to individuals, abstract beliefs to concrete emotions. And we may wish "to reflect on the kinds of interpretive circumspection required for approaching such evidence."</page><page sequence="14">14 Religion and American Culture I fear that I lack interpretive circumspection. Having done lit- tle reading recently in American religious autobiography, I suspect that I will take the easy way out, writing autobiographically rather than about autobiography. Off the top of my head, I count a half doz- en articles written in the last ten years by me and about me. I wince, remembering an observation of that inestimable teller of American Indian nature tales, Barry Lopez. White men like to tell their stories ("Pearyland," Outside, September 1994, 96, paraphrased). And I re- member how easy it was a few years ago to find religious autobiogra- phies from white Christian men like me when collecting such narra- tives for a project (Religious Autobiographies, 1995). By contrast, there did not seem to be a single religious autobiography written in English by a traditional Muslim woman. Is it the interpretive circumspection of Islamic women that ac- counts for the relative paucity of English language accounts of their religious experience? Or the lack of English translations of, say, Irani- an texts? Or something more pernicious, the silencing effects of patri- archy? I don't know. And I don't know whether my generalization about the relative paucity of Muslim women autobiographies in English is correct. But I resolve not to begin this essay autobiographi- cally. Alas, too late. I intend to write about three things: about the idea that our lives are inherently narratively shaped even before we lend them any narrative form; about the ethical implications of not being able to tell your own autobiography; and about a recent experience that had me questioning my authorship of my life story. Inherently Narratively Shaped Lives An idea has intrigued me since my graduate school days at the University of Chicago Divinity School. I associate it with the names of Stephen Crites, Paul Ricoeur, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Stanley Hauerwas. The idea is that autobiographies are possible be- cause life is already shaped like a story. MacIntyre, for example, puts it like this: "We all live out narratives in our lives" ("The Vir- tues, the Unity of Human Life, and the Concept of a Tradition," in Memory, Identity, Community, ed. Lewis P. Hinchman and Sandra K. Hinchman, 1997, 249). MacIntyre and others are probably not assert- ing that many of us tell stories about ourselves. That thesis must be painfully obvious to anyone who knows a white man. Many readers of this journal-and not only the self-obsessed academics-will have employed literary constructs (plot, theme, character, setting, mood) and computer and paper to produce stories about them-</page><page sequence="15">Forum 15 selves. But some will not have. Some will never record their lives in written form, and some will never tell the story of their life to another. Is it possible that some people never tell themselves the story of their life? If MacIntyre and others are claiming that some people shape their lives by making up autobiographies, then they're saying little of interest. But it is far more likely that they are saying some- thing very intriguing. That all of us-red and yellow, black and white-are able to make up autobiographies only because our lives are already structured by the elements of plots, characters, different moods, and settings. In some lectures he delivered at Chicago more than a decade ago, Paul Ricoeur called the narrative representations we construct mimesis2. Autobiographies are one example. Such representations, Ricoeur argued, are not based on the raw data of our lives because there is no "raw data." That is, there is no experience of one moment of time after another. Autobiographies are based rather on experiences that are already plotted, characterized, mooded, settinged. (These are my awkward words, not Ricoeur's.) At bottom, our lives do not con- sist of serial entries in a ledger, pegging experience A to time T at place P. At bottom, our lives have mimetic shape, beginnings and endings, intrigues and twists. I am oversimplifying Ricoeur's theory here and perhaps mis- remembering important details, but I believe Ricoeur referred to this originary layer of our lives as mimesis'. Now, is it the case that mimesis2 is possible only because our lives are never "raw data" at all but rath- er are shaped as mimesis' right from the start? Is life story-shaped whether we know it or not? The answer would seem to be no, or so it would seem if we are talking about life in general. The vast majority of life forms lack the temporal organization of plottedness. Microorganisms, viruses, plants, and mollusks have no experiences, and the raw data of their lives can be communicated in biological terms like birth, growth, de- cay, reproduction, death. There's no mimesis' in this case because there's no point of view, no desire, no memories, and no goals. To think that all life is story-shaped, therefore, would be inexcusably anthropomorphic. Apparently, therefore, only certain life-forms come into the world originally as mimesis'. (I don't mean to imply that MacIntyre, Ricoeur, and others would disagree with the point about plant life.) Humans are a paradigm case of mimetic life. To that extent, human life is special. But perhaps not as special as we might think. To have a life that is, as it were, ontologically structured as mimesis; is not necessar-</page><page sequence="16">16 Religion and American Culture ily to have a life capable of supporting the writing of one's autobi- ography. It is simply to have a life that has desires, a point of view, memories, and goals. It's to have the kind of life that someone could write a biography about. But Mischa, our family cat, has a biography, which my daughter will happily recount for you. So the claim that life is inherently narratively shaped applies only to humans and, perhaps, some animals. What has this to do with autobiography? Autobiography is a self-reflexive narrative in which we adopt the point of view of the subject looking at the subject. Per- haps one of the few distinguishing features of human life is that we can adopt this perspective, looking at someone as they want us to look at them. Cats, arguably, cannot do that. I sometimes ask my students to write their religious autobi- ographies. I let anyone off the hook who wants off by permitting them to choose not to turn in the assignment if they prefer to keep their spiritual lives confidential. But they must write the autobiography. Over the years, I have not once had a student decline to turn in the pa- per. After I collect and read the essays, I inform the class that I will read some of the autobiographies aloud during the next class. I invite them to get in touch with me if they would prefer that I not share theirs with the group. Not one student has ever asked that I not read theirs. Why? Autobiography is an expression of a specific desire, the desire to be known by others according to the story by which one knows oneself. Our students want to be known. There is the question of the truth of these stories. All (and only?) humans are capable of lying to themselves about themselves. What would a true autobiography be? Those, perhaps, in which mimesis2 accurately corresponds to mimesis'. But how do we know when we're lying to ourselves about ourselves? How do we get to mimesis' apart from mimesis2? If we can't know the originary ex- perience without the story about it, how can we know when we're fabricating? There is a methodological question. What sort of experiment might we devise to test the hypothesis that our lives are, at bottom, mimesis'? Would not every allegedly objective test be biased from the start? Suppose we tried to examine other people's lives to see if they experienced mimesis' before they constructed mimesis2. We might ask them: What is your life like? What makes it intelligible? Wouldn't we get answers couched in familiar terms: memorable highlights, painful conflicts, grave mistakes, unintended slights, triumphant decisions? And wouldn't these terms already suggest the outlines of some narra- tive account?</page><page sequence="17">Forum 17 Suppose we tried to examine our own lives without starting with autobiography. What gives my various experiences coherence? Won't the answer be similar? It seems that our only access to our lives is through autobiog- raphy. We can't identify mimesis' unless we assume that it has a narra- tive structure. But that begs the question because we had set out to discover whether or not our lives are inherently narratively struc- tured. We cannot legitimately answer that question by turning around and asserting it as a declaration. Perhaps all we can say is this. Our lives certainly seem like stories in many ways: both have beginnings and middles; both have characters; both are temporal; both have causal connections between earlier and later events. But, in some ways, our lives are not like sto- ries at all-or at least not like written stories. Written stories have endings known to the author. These endings influence the interpreta- tion, and the rewriting of, the beginning and middle. Autobiogra- phers do not know the peculiar twist of the ending of their stories because they, at least, do not make it that far. They, unlike Moses, are not around to tell themselves how it all ends. And the parts of our lives are not as accessible as they are in texts. A written story's parts are right there. I read the spellbinding autobiographical essay "Becoming Michael" by Frederick Suppe, the University of Maryland philosopher of science (in Philosophers Who Believe: The Spiritual Journeys of Eleven Leading Thinkers, ed. Kelly James Clark, 1993, 137-78). I learn that he was born before World War II, was the middle of three sons, and was baptized in the Congrega- tional church. How do I know? I just turn to page 141, and there it is written. I find on page 142 that his father was 35 when the war ended; on page 146 that he went to lots of gospel sings and services when he was in high school; and on page 154 that he converted to Catholicism in 1973 while in a monogamous homosexual relationship. It's all there. I check back over the references a second time, just to make sure that I have it right. Our lives are not like this. We can't turn a page to find out what we were doing at 2:37 P.M. of the thirty-fourth day of the fifth grade. Most of life is like that, lost not in the dim imperceptible reaches of memory but just lost. Period. At the same time, texts are all, as some now like to say, on the surface. Daniel Beaumont makes the point nicely: "As I experience it, the present is always (or almost always) vivid and clear. So my expe- rience through time is not narrative in its form-only my recollection of it may impart to it a narrative form-and even that is a formidable task" ("The Modality of Narrative: A Critique of Some Recent Views</page><page sequence="18">18 Religion and American Culture of Narrative in Theology," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 65, Spring 1997, 135). And what difference does it make that most of our life is lost to us? Oliver Sacks writes of a man, if I'm not mistaken, named Clive. Clive lacks short-term memory; he must be told each day when he wakes up who he is. Clive is unable to give his life thematic unity, to connect events from his childhood with his present dispositions, to use the past to form meaningful overarching goals. Clive is pitiable because he lacks the ability to connect the serial events of his life. Clive's life is not shaped as mimesis'. Ethical Implications Like Clive, some people lack autobiographability. What dif- ference should this make in our obligations to them? May we submit them to experimental tests without their consent because they will not remember the tests tomorrow? Were we to assume that psycho- logical continuity and the capacity to reflect on events in our lives were a necessary condition of personhood, then all manner of people suffering personality disorders would lack moral standing. But that seems wrong-headed. Clive no more lacks moral standing because he lacks autobiographability than a Buddhist monk lacks moral standing because he claims that the present slice of his existence bears no causal connection to the slices immediately preceding and following it. Not being able to tell your own story does not necessarily de- flate your moral significance. Of course, this applies across the board. To the extent that you have some desires, even three of them, you ought to be entitled to pursue them, all other things being equal, and assuming you won't harm someone by pursuing them. If you lack long-term memory or the ability to plan your life or tell its story, you still are entitled to go on living. And while this condition does not accurately describe the state of fica trees and clams, it does describe cats, dogs, cows, and chickens. It would seem, therefore, that so long as someone can tell your story, you have the right to exist, whether you can tell it or not. Thus, the case for moral vegetarianism. Roll Your Own Months ago, one of my eyes itched. I looked in the mirror to see that the cornea was slightly off-color. Nothing, says my wife, con- centrates the mind of a man like the prospect of a little pain. Pink eye is such a mild malady that it does not bring even the prospect of pain,</page><page sequence="19">Forum 19 much less threaten serious bodily harm. (Or so I have learned.) None- theless, a man, I did not wait to finish breakfast before calling to make an appointment with a doctor. When Dr. Pepperl's secretary answered, I asked her if I could come in tomorrow. Why, certainly, she said, adding mysteriously, "at 2:25." That was exactly the time I was going to propose. Being there then would give me time to finish teaching my last class and the fifteen-minute cushion I needed to get to the clinic. An earlier ap- pointment would have conflicted with my class; a later appointment would have meant wasting valuable time sitting in a doctor's office reading Newsweek. How did she know what I wanted, I asked her. She replied, "What do you mean, how did I know?" "How did you know that I would like to see the doctor at 2:25 P.M. tomorrow?" No answer. When she finally spoke, she seemed si- multaneously baffled and perturbed. "Mr. Comstock, we have had you scheduled for that appoint- ment for over a month." Huh? A woman I'd never met knew, weeks ahead of time, not only the day I would get pink eye but also the time I would want to see her boss. Who was she? A Celestial Calendar Keeper in an alternate uni- verse? A new trainee at Galaxy Defenders who'd mistakenly let me peer into the workings of the Men in Black, her boss asking her later if she'd snapped her pen-wand to erase the occult knowledge she'd slipped me? Suppose our lives at bottom are mimesis', not raw data. Sup- pose that "the formal quality of experience through time is inherently narrative" (Stephen Crites, "The Narrative Quality of Experience," Journal of the American Academy of Religion 39, June 1971, 291-311). And suppose that the way we come to understand ourselves is through telling ourselves the story of our lives, by creating little autobiogra- phies. What if the story we make up today bears no resemblance to the story we have always told ourselves? What if the significance of the events in the story we now believe is different from the significance we have always attached to them? What, if every time you made a doctor's appointment, the doctor's secretary already knew what ailed you? And knew that what you thought ailed you did not ail you? What if our best attempt at mimesis2 bears no relation to the reality that is mimesis'? P. S. In place of a conclusion, I have an explanatory postscript. Months prior to my unnerving conversation with the nurse, I had</page><page sequence="20">20 Religion and American Culture scheduled a routine check-up for 2:25 on the day in question. I'd just plum forgot about it. Sometimes mimesis2 is much more interesting than mimesis'. Other times, the story ain't half as good as the experience. (Thanks to Karen Werner Comstock for editorial suggestions and advice.) RICHARD RABINOWITZ We write our lives with more than words-with color and shape and heft and smell, and with a thousand personal and social associations as dense as any sentence or paragraph. So, too, do we inscribe our autobiographies in artifacts, spaces, and patterns of work and play and social interaction. As a historian of ideas turned museum professional, I have had to learn how to construct community histories by reassembling the evidences of changing material life. A character in Proust says that we look at history the way a chicken surveys the bits of shell from which it has come. Ob- jects are surely among the largest pieces of the "eggshell" be- queathed to us. Historians of modern religion have relied almost entirely on written sources. True, generations of formalist and iconographic studies of religious art and architecture have explored the spiritual expressiveness of churches, synagogues, mosques, and of the sacred objects with which they are endowed. And historians of societies with fewer documents to study, ancient cultures as well as preliter- ate ones, have learned to decode the religious experience implicit in totemic and ritual artifacts. Still, most scholars have often equated religion with its documentation in introspective diaries, sermons, theological writings, devotional manuals, and organizational records, as well as the sacred texts and commentaries of "the religions of the book." Academic cultures are largely text cultures, and hence scholarly communications are almost entirely literary. We thereby privilege the religious actions of the articulate, even the argumenta- tive. But how narrowly we thus construe religious life, how much of its relationship to ordinary people and everyday life we exclude! In the three sections that follow, I will endeavor to describe the religious significance of my own encounter with ordinary objects. The actions I describe-ballplaying, dressing up, buying books-are not in themselves sacred exercises. But they are far more telling of my religious experience than reading from Torah scrolls or saying the Sabbath prayers or even undergoing the bar mitzvah ritual.</page><page sequence="21">Forum 21 The Spaldeen, Sin, and Divine Justice Objects are often the locus of moral problematics and reli- gious metaphors in unexpected ways. For children of the New York streets during the 1940's and 1950's, nothing exceeded in importance the pink rubber ball produced by the Spalding sporting-goods com- pany and universally known in New York as the "spaldeen." Stick- ball, punchball, handball, off-the-wall, hit the penny, curves, and the so-called Chinese versions of these games depended upon these won- derful balls and upon little else but the players' skill and endless sum- mer afternoons. The spaldeen was harder than other rubber balls, so it was difficult to press one's knuckles into it and make it squirt off in odd directions (called "making an 'eggball'"). But it was much softer than the black handball, the large softball, or the baseball, all of which re- quired gloves and a proper court or field; hence it could be played on streets with little fear of damaging car and apartment windows. Its surface was easily dried after a roll through an inevitable puddle. Spaldeens could even be redeemed after they descended into the un- derworld of the storm drains at the corner. We would lower one of our comrades, the one with the least sense and the greatest tolerance of malodorous places, into the drain and lift the balls with a wire coat hanger out into the sunshine. Then, after a dousing in the kitchen sink with hot water (while one's mother's head was turned), the balls were almost as good as new. At twenty-five cents each, spaldeens in 1955 were not easily replaced. What made spaldeens important, I think, for my religious de- velopment was their utter foolhardiness. Right on every spaldeen it said it was a "hi-bounce ball," and it was. We lived in an engineered world, full of straight lines and hard surfaces. In this environment, the spaldeen bounced high and hard off ground and wall, rolled this way and that, seldom slowing down much until it was totally stopped, just behind a car wheel or in a downspout. A spaldeen soaring a hundred feet in the air off a broomstick and then bounding beyond three "sewers" (manhole covers spaced every fifty feet or so down the center of the street) was, to the batter, a manifestation of perfect transcendence. To the pitcher, it was a de- scent into obloquy, correspondingly discouraging. After such a hit, success and failure were each ritually enacted. The slugger would loll in the shade, twirling his bat, while the pitcher ran helplessly after the errant scamp. The spaldeen was, thus, an impulsive creature, the embodi- ment of every uncontrolled impulse a child could feel. Let go, the</page><page sequence="22">22 Religion and American Culture spaldeen would roll, bounce, bang against walls, and, ultimately, be- come irretrievably lost-a perfect illustration of a child gone bad. Balls are so anciently a child's toy that we forget how developmental- ly and psychologically appropriate they are. The ability to throw and catch a ball is a significant motor skill, but it also demonstrates a child's crucial command over his (I use the pronoun here carefully) world. A golden retriever can catch, but judging a flyball perfectly and "pegging" it to the catcher on the fly could only be done by supe- rior mortals (especially centerfielders in that age of Mantle, Mays, and Snider). Retrieving the ball meant restoring the game. To a toddler, the rhythmic reciprocity involved in playing catch is surely the first great example of engaging one's detached self with a reliable parent; in- deed, with a trustworthy universe. To a boy of eight or nine, keeping an evenly matched game going became even more important than winning or losing. The games with spaldeens were our finest moral teachers-they demanded that you play your proper position, yield when your turn was up, give everyone a chance, and cease boasting or gloating a few seconds before tempers were lost. I will bet that I was not the only boy who tossed and caught a ball repeatedly against a wall, all the while repeating vows to conduct myself properly in class or around the dinner table. Of course, one could have stood close to the wall and tossed it gently, but the point was the opposite-to stand far back and throw line drives that would be difficult to catch. Play in the Brooklyn of my youth was strictly gender-bounded. With the exception of an occasional "tomboy," girls did not join in the ball games I have described here. Girls did toss and catch a smaller rubber ball while trying to gather up the right number of jacks. And they bounced and stepped rhythmically over a spaldeen as they recited, "A, my name is Alice, and my husband's name is Al," and similar chants. Girls used balls as markers of times; for boys, they were in- struments for testing the limits of one's freedom. For this reason, ball games were opportunities for consider- able competition and conflict. Our games had no adult observers or umpires. With two outs and the bases filled, a flyball that grazed a car on its descent would mean the inning was over. But if it hit the ground first, it might mean two or three runs and the victory. Dis- putes over the facts of the case were usually followed by accusations of cheating. Fortunately, in such instances, we could resort to a won- derful institution called the "do-over." One side or the other would eventually end the argument by saying, "it's a do-over." Play would then resume from the status quo ante.</page><page sequence="23">Forum 23 But the do-over was no ordinary matter of child's play. The proverb most frequently cited on city streets affirmed that "cheaters always lose." No human mechanism could resolve the conflict of bat- ter and outfielder; only divine justice sufficed. If we thought about God at all on those hot summer afternoons, it was as a supremely powerful judge. At that age, we paid little or no heed to the Hebrew prayers that noted God's various attributes. In fact, we had probably got God confused a bit with Santa Claus. I recall thinking of the deity as circling the earth in a chariot not unlike the one that carried Santa through the skies each Christmas. The do-over was a signal to God to slam on the brakes right over Bradford Street, take a moment out of his eternally busy journey, watch, and even dictate the results in a way that vindicated that player who had been victimized in the last at-bat. In the exact moment of the do-over, when the spaldeen was still suspended in the air, just as the bat was beginning its swing, then we had our strongest proof of God's interest in us and his ability to act as the immediate ruler of the universe. As in the medieval trial by or- deal, the do-over makes no sense to a rational, rule-bound jurispru- dence. But we children at play were not yet subject to law or king. Though we could not have said why, playing ball deeply implicated us in the moral dramas of the universe. It was the core of our reli- gious life. Shiny Shoes and Social Presence Material objects have a grammar different from that of words. Real things, for instance, lack two fundamental and remarkable qual- ities of language-the concept of the negative and the (apparently eternal) impermeability of words to destruction. First, no object can, by itself, point to its absence; a bus cannot express the idea, "there is no bus." Second, words are not used up when they are used. Things, by contrast, are generally changed or diminished by use, retained or discarded, and sometimes reused. A pair of shoes, for example, is quite unlike the words used to teach lace-tying to children. The words may be repeated in exactly the same form to succeeding generations of children, apparently without end. But the shoes to which they have original application will soon be replaced. In fact, those children's size-three or -four shoes may be seen as casual milestones within a lifelong series of a person's shoes, ever changing--booties, bedroom slippers, sandals, sneakers, Ox- fords, hiking boots, ballet slippers, flip-flops, moccasins, work shoes, Wellingtons, ski boots, and so on.</page><page sequence="24">24 Religion and American Culture As we get older, depending on our family's financial resources and tastes, we generally acquire a wider variety of shoes to meet a wider array of social circumstances. Our "biographical shoe rack," should we have been able or willing to retain every pair, would be an interesting and important index of our maturing. My earliest shoe memories are of life divided into two catego- ries. I wore a pair of lace-up leather shoes, always brown, to school in the early 1950's in Brooklyn, New York, and replaced them ("reli- giously") with sneakers when I returned home in the afternoon. I re- call the sneakers having been considerably worn by the time we went back to the local shop for a new pair, but they were supplanted only when they were outgrown. The shoes seem not to have undergone the same degree of wear, but they were repeatedly scuffed by months of schoolyard high jinks, hallway chases, and repeated banging against the iron frame of the fixed seat in front of me in class. I did not have special shoes for synagogue, even for the High Holy Days, which were generally the only times our family attended (until I was preparing for my own bar mitzvah). Instead, when I was to join the family on social occasions, including such religious events as family weddings, bar mitzvahs, and funerals, my brown school shoes were brightly shined. My father made a ceremony of the shin- ing, with cans and brushes and a humorously noisy spit and stories about his business experience as a bootblack boy on the Lower East Side early in the century. Looking back, I am struck with wonder at how he could shine up tired looking school shoes. Shininess was basic to my childhood religiosity. The most common explicitly religious objects in our household were the Sab- bath candles lit every Friday evening by my mother. After the tradi- tional meal of soup and roasted chicken, the family decamped to the television room for an evening of American popular entertainment. The candles burned on, casting an eerie, even holy, light over the di- nette table. Often, during commercials, I stole back into the dinette to ponder the odd stalagmites of melted paraffin rolling like lava over the glass candlesticks. In fact, most of our major religious events-rites of passage as well as holidays-were constructed around glass, silver, and precious fluids. Whenever the family gathered at a br'it, a bar mitzvah, a wed- ding, or a funeral, the men lifted shot glasses of "shnapps" (actually usually a rye whiskey like Canadian Club), toasted the occasion, "I'chaim" ("to life"), and drank off the liquor in a single swallow. Al- cohol was seldom consumed on other occasions. The toast marked the family's evolving relationship to God's will. No one ever dis- cussed theology, and there were many whose experience of the Holo-</page><page sequence="25">Forum 25 caust had made notions of theodicy notionally absurd, but, as a child, I constantly heard the refrain, "God should be good to us." And, of course, Passover seders, the most common form of religious observance and the most important family gatherings of the year, featured lots of glasses-nominally four glasses of wine for ev- eryone present (although, in my family, this was moderated to mean four sips). On this evening, every candlestick was called into service. The most ancient family treasure, of all those brought by Europe in the third-class compartment of the Red Star Line, was the glass rever- ently filled with wine for the Prophet Elijah so that he might partake of some refreshment on his way to announcing the appearance of the messiah. In sum, candlelight, alcoholic beverages, a socially intense and publicly acknowledged sense of the family's persistence through history and through triumphs and tragedies-all these formed a grammar of sacred life connected to the shininess of the shoes I wore. In subsequent years, my shoe rack diversified along with my social identity. Loafers expressed lax social controls and sexual awak- ening in my adolescence, wingtips were a sign of bureaucratic dignity in my first regular job, and nifty hiking boots an investment in my an- nual getaway to Scotland. But all these are "secular" shoes. I want to explore for a mo- ment the most important pairs of religious shoes in my closet. One set is a pair of patent leather dancing pumps, which I wear to black-tie dinners, especially openings and fund-raising events for my museum clients. It is curious to me how much these exceedingly shiny shoes repeat my childhood pattern. At these events, as at the family gather- ings of my youth, I am largely an observer, detached from the glitter. I am there to lend my professional weight to the celebration of a pa- tron's generosity. Sometimes I am acknowledged by attendees, some- times not. Aloof, I float on the surface of this shininess. At more engaging religious events, shoes are more problem- atic. In the informal Conservative synagogue I attend, devoted as in- tensely to feminism, Zionism, and social justice as to spiritualism and critical Torah learning, my friends wear every variety of footwear from Converse high-tops to Robert Clergerie pumps. But, on Yom Kippur, an interesting issue comes into play. According to strict Jewish tradition, one is not to wear animal skins on the Day of Atonement, and many of my co-congregants come shod in sneakers, even if they are wearing business suits and dresses. (In fact, many of these more observant worshipers don a long white caftan for the High Holy Days.) I am torn. The caftan seems too exotic for me, the rubber shoes too transgressive of my own sense of proper respect for the</page><page sequence="26">26 Religion and American Culture place and too absurd next to the smart Italian suits I prefer. I am still wearing my elegant, slim-welted Salvatore Ferragamo shoes. Is this distinction trivial? I would suggest that in some way the choice of my shoes for Yom Kippur is at least as "articulate" as my choice of which phrases to use as English translations for the litany of sins that I con- fess to having committed during the previous year. Were I to slip on the Nikes, would I be truer to my God but less respectful of my com- mitments to fair labor and environmental practices? In our study of vernacular religious thought and practice, we need to be attentive to these distinctions. Creating a Library: The Heretic as Architect Books have been far the most treasured artifacts of my adult life. That is, aside from what they have been about or how they have been used, books have been my most constant companions, the most omnipresent decorative element in my rooms, and virtually the only objects I have collected, sorted, and maintained. Books are, in truth, the architecture, the environment, of my adulthood. In creating a li- brary, I made a home for myself. Yet, buying books, it turns out, has always been as much about rebellion as about aspiration and settle- ment. The autobiography of my library has been marked by three ges- tures of combined spiritual attachment and defiance. Religious historians have frequently studied the libraries of important theologians. Inventories of libraries are presumptively doc- uments of intellectual influence. Marginal annotations are the best proof of minds engaging minds. But I want here to think about library-formation in a different way. I am not concerned with the ac- tual titles of the books in my "lifelong book case" but, rather, in the motives and the rules by which it was constructed. I grew up in a household that possessed precisely four vol- umes. One was a "self-pronouncing dictionary," and I recall bending my youthful ear several times, alas unsuccessfully, to hear its sounds. Well, it was quite old. We also owned three volumes of an encyclope- dia offered weekly by a local market, at least until my mother switched soap brands and thereby cut off the range of my curiosity. (Ask me about anything in the alphabet that comes before the "Firth of Forth Bridge"!) Not that we were not readers. In fact, my father was one of Andrew Carnegie's most loyal legatees. Every Wednesday for a de- cade, he piled my sister and me into the car, and we ranged over Brooklyn, scouting out public library branches with well-stocked shelves. (This was surely one of my first pieces of sociological inves-</page><page sequence="27">Forum 27 tigation. We knew that, as neighborhoods "changed"-say from second-generation ethnics to first-generation immigrants-the local library would have lots of wonderful books in English still left on its bookcases. Our own home branch, in East New York, was hopelessly over-subscribed; it was said to own ten times as many volumes as it had room for on its shelves.) So we read, all the time, all of us. We im- mersed ourselves in books, and this allowed us to escape the whole noisy teeming world of gossip-mongering, sibling-arguing neighbors. My sister and I can still read straight through a hurricane or a rock concert. We just did not own books. Until, that is, I got to high school, when I began to collect books by the bundle. (After forty years, my father still looks incredu- lously at a house brimming with 6,000 volumes and asks, "What's the matter? They shut down the libraries on you?") As a teenager, I prowled Manhattan's rows of used-book stores along Fourth Avenue, seeking out good reading copies of what were universally acknowl- edged as "the classics." First, the great nineteenth-century novelists- Dickens, Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy. Then, the great English dramatists-Shakespeare, Shaw, Marlowe. Then, the Greek tragedians and philosophers. Then, the masterworks of modern Euro- pean thought-Mill, Marx, Freud. And, finally, a dose of literary mod- ernism-Joyce, Sartre, Camus, Beckett. This was by no means a lonely pursuit, and I was no autodi- dact. I was surrounded at Stuyvesant High School by a dozen other as- piring intellectuals, and we were powerfully supported by school teachers and cultural administrators. A teacher got us one-dollar or- chestra tickets to Broadway plays on weeknights, we negotiated a pur- chase of ten seats for ten dollars with the New York City Ballet at the City Center, we stood regularly at the old Metropolitan Opera, and our gang seized upon every performance of Ionesco or Genet in the then- emerging Off Broadway houses. Three of us, I recall, gathered on Friday evenings for all-night symposia built around oral readings of Plato's di- alogues. Purchasing the books, however, became my special passion. Of course, this was all pretentious, but it was also the fastest route to a liberal education. Looking back, I am struck at how rebel- lious it also was. This was not what my parents had in mind. My fam- ily valued education for its prospective professional value, but they equally distrusted learning for its elitist implications. Purchasing books and thronging to theaters and concerts was a sign of the bour- geois material success they wanted for me, but it was a sign of resis- tance at the same time. What kind of resistance? Resistance to social expectation on the one hand, but on the other, as it turned out, to academic ortho-</page><page sequence="28">28 Religion and American Culture doxy as well. For me, Harvard College and Graduate School were in- tellectually barren after such an exciting Greenwich Village adoles- cence, but I did not have the faintest idea of how to say "no" to these worldly honors. Books, again, proved a vehicle for aspiration and rebellion. In the late 1960's and early 1970's, the heyday of academic en- thusiasm, it seemed that publishers were eager to get between covers as many even obscure treasures of the past as they could. As a student of American history and literature, I snatched up new editions of Lafcadio Hearn and Sidney Lanier, Charles Brockden Brown and Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Mary Wilkens Freeman. When I began my dissertation research, surveying the personal accounts of religious experience of New Englanders between 1780 and 1860, I scoured the antiquarian bookshops of the region. Eventually, my shelves were filled to a groaning with published memoirs of obscure Christian martyrs and renowned church luminaries. It was especially impor- tant, I recall, to acquire complete leather-bound sets of the works of Edwards, Bellamy, Hopkins, Dwight, Emmons, Channing, and other leading theologians. Again, why? The American Antiquarian Society was in full flower, and I loved my pilgrimages to a dozen little seminary librar- ies around New England and New York. Owning the volumes, though, expressed a sort of liberty from institutional affiliation that was deeply pleasurable. When I came to the acknowledgments page of the book that emerged from the dissertation, it was the antiquarian booksellers who earned pride of place, where so many of my contemporaries had listed university colleagues, foundations, and editors. Finally, my third and presumably last "library," the one I am amassing now. This bears many likenesses to the first, in that it is largely focused on "classical" literature-Homer, the Greek and Ro- man historians, Dante, Shakespeare, Melville, several Jewish philoso- phers, but now in their original languages. And it looks a lot like the second, since it includes many scholarly works, especially commen- taries on these authors. This third library aims to be a habitat for morning exercises in translation and philological exploration. One day, when my labors as a continent-trotting museum planner can be surrendered, this is what I would like to do. Now I venture onto this terrain, into this house of study, only fitfully-on winter Saturdays in New York and summer mornings in the Hebrides. While I sometimes read contemporary fiction, it fits uneasily in my library. Even my apparently endless vocation of reading Antho- ny Trollope does not actually add to the store of permanent books.</page><page sequence="29">Forum 29 Books with notable currency violate my basic collecting premises-it would never occur to me to read what is hot. Library-building has always been my way of treading the line between fidelity and heresy, between bourgeois possessiveness and aristocratic taste, between professional alertness and deeper intellec- tual ambitions. Under the regimen of trifocals, reading becomes more a devotional exercise than a practical aid or an entertainment. I learn as much from the pages that are closed as from those whose words I read. Just holding the book still in front of me, forestalling all the buzz and din around me, is a chance for my true "neshuma" (soul) to be readied for the world's multiple, conflicting meanings-which come to me not from books but from reflection. A Bibliographical Note It is impossible to footnote this essay, but readers interested in innovative explorations of material culture might turn to Ian Hodder, ed., The Meanings of Things: Material Culture and Symbolic Expression (London: Unwin Hyman, 1989); Mihaly Csikszentmihaly and Eugene Rochberg-Halton, The Meaning of Things: Domestic Symbols and the Self (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1981); and Nils-Arrid Bringeus, ed., Religion in Everyday Life: Papers Given at a Symposium, 13-15 September 1993, arranged by the Royal Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities along with the Foundation Natur och Kultur, Publishers (Stockholm, n.d.). I have been long influenced by the works of the French psychologist Gaston Bachelard and the British anthropologist Mary Douglas and, more recently, by geographers and anthropolo- gists of landscape, especially Yi-Fu Tuan and Jay Appleton. Jean Pia- get and Jerome Bruner are touchstones for my analysis of childhood development. Histories of reading are becoming more common, but thus far they have focused (at least in American studies) on middle- class tastes (see Janice Radway, A Feeling for Books: The Book-of-the- Month Club, Literary Taste, and Middle-Class Desire [Chapel Hill: Uni- versity of North Carolina Press, 1997]) that are quite remote from my own experience.</page></plain_text>
