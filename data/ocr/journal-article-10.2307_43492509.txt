(George Wither, To His Noble Friend, Michael Drayton, Esquire)1 WlTHER's COMMENDATORY verse, appended to Pbly-Olbion Part II, not only emphasises that this poem will survive the ravages of time, but also subtly suggests that landscape change lies at the heart of the text. As an outcome of Michael Drayton's 'strange Herculean toyle',2 Pbly-Olbion was one of the earliest attempts to write an epic poem dealing with British antiquity, but what is more intriguing is how Drayton evolves a distinct design of his own. Pbly-Olbion is comparable to an epic in scope, but incor- porates elements of the georgic, the pastoral, topography, and satire within the larger framework of a 'chorographical' poem. Grappling with the generic classification of such a text, George Wither finally declares it to be a 'Topo-chrono-graphicall Poeme'.3 Drawing on Raymond Williams's notion that the 'country' and the 'city' carried their own 1 The Works of Michael Drayton , cd.

The potential of Pbly-Olbion as a rich hinterland for 'green studies' has never been explored; I will seek to decipher the hermeneutic possibilities of the poem by adopting an ecocri tical approach. Exploring the changes in the seventeenth-century paradigm of con- ceptions of nature, Keith Thomas noted: it was not on Tower Hill that the axe made its important contribution to English history . . . the stroke that beheaded King Charles may have been partly an extension of all the other axe blows by which England gradually moved from a feudal-agrarian society towards an urban-industrial one.5 Literary opposition to changing rural economies was common enough as early as the fourteenth century. It is significant that the 'peasants' revolt' of 1381 attacked lawyers and rent-collecting landlords, rather than the nobility per se, given the fact that many members of the newer country gentry served as real-life examples of stock abusers of social privilege. Works like Richard the fadeless, Mum and Sothsegger. ; the Digby 1 02 collection (containing Langland's Vision Concerning Piers Plowman as well as a large body of complaint verse), and Gower's complaint vividly record social dis- orientation and confrontation between the rural poor and the moneyed urban 'middle class'.6 Similarly, the vitriolic polemic found in the anti- enclosure literature of the sixteenth century shows a preoccupation with the effects of England's flourishing wool industry on agrarian commu- nities. While texts like Vox Populi Vox Dei and Philip Stubbe's Anatomie of Abuses (1583) assert that transforming land for tillage into sheep-grazing land would lead to the ultimate demise of England, a whole body of popular literature also flourished, with many ballads emphasising the changes wrought by enclosures. Even highly formalised early modern pas- toral literature connects in meaningful ways with the agrarian world by drawing attention to the material realities that exist 'under the pretty tales of wolves and sheep'.7 4 Sec Raymond Williams, The Country and the City (New York 1973) p. 1.

Drayton's text offers a radical new way of reading the land and writing about it, differing in significant ways even from its chorographic predecessors such as Leland's Itinerary, Lambarde's A RmmbulOtion of Kent , and Camden's Britannia with their narrative surveys of places. The extent of Drayton's generic and thematic departure can be appreciated in the way in which fíoty-Olbion engages with ecological issues and how Drayton seems to share many of the insights of the modern 'green movement', particulaiiy in his use of specifically non-human voices in the text. While Drayton's poignant awareness of landscape change and his cri- tique of contemporary practices in land management are evident through- out Pbly-Olbim , these issues often manifest themselves, unusually, in the form of ecological concerns. As one of the earliest 'environmentalists', Drayton's plea for the preservation of England's pristine environment was born of an acute and painful recognition of a changing agricultural economy. This interface that the text offers between the economic, the ecological, the political, and the social opens up the interesting possibility of interpreting and illuminating Fbly-Olbion from the point of view of ecocriticism. In The Ecocriticism Reader, ; Cheryll Glotfelty argues that literature can transmit values with profound ecological implications, while Richard Kerridge, in his introduction to Writing the Environment , suggests that ecocri- ticism seeks to evaluate texts and ideas in terms of their coherence and usefulness as responses to environmental crisis.8 Drayton's resistance to deforestation, the drainage of the fens, enclosures, disafforestation,9 and the loss of community life expresses a set of ethical values deeply rooted in rural English culture. For instance, in Song XVII of Poly-Olbion, the forest nymphs bitterly witness and lament the passing of a whole way of life in Sussex: When labouring carts they saw to hold their dayly trade, Where they in summer wont to sport them in the shade. Could we, say they, suppose, that any would us cherish, Which suffer (every day) the holiest things to perish? Or to our daily want minister supply? These yron times breed none, that minde posteritie. Tis but in vaine to tell, what we before have been, 8 See Cheryll Glotfelty and Harold Fromm (eds.), The Ecocriticism Reader: Landmarks in literary Ecology (Athens, Ga. 1996); Richard Kerridge and Neil Sammells (eds.), Writing the Environment: Ecocriticism and Literature (London 1998) p. 5. 9 'Disafforestation' was the procedure by which the legal definition of a piece of land was changed from forest to wasteland and the land rights were sold.</page><page sequence="4">DRAYTON'S 'SILENT SPRING' 155 Or changes of the world, that we in time have seen; When, not devising how to spend our wealth with waste, We to the savage swine, let fall our larding mast. But now, alas, our selves we have not to sustaine, Nor can our tops suffice to shield our Roots from raine. (391- 402) It may be recollected that Sussex was one of the earliest locations for iron works, and Drayton draws our attention to the consequent transformation the land has undergone. The terminology itself emphasises the myopic vision of the present: the earlier wealth of natural resources ('larding masť) has been sacrificed to the commercial interests of the contemporary 'savage swine', and the repercussions are immediate. Now the forests, depleted of their foliage, are not even capable of protecting themselves from inclement weather. Here deforestation symbolises a loss of commu- nity life, a moral decline, an erasure of a whole system of ethics that gives value to the past. The ethical issues that are being raised by Drayton here are echoed by modern historians such as Donald Worster, who contends: We are facing a global crisis today, not because of how ecosystems function but rather because of how our ethical systems function. Getting through the crisis requires understanding our impact on nature as precisely as possible but even more, it requires understand- ing those ethical systems.10 Although Worster is writing from a modern, global perspective, there are nevertheless obvious areas of convergence where the early modern and the modern can enter into productive dialogue. In Back to Nature , Robert N. Watson argues that Protestant Europe was in the grip of a cultural crisis and contends that the result of this crisis was the development of a new but distinctively nostalgic interest in nature: the real was sought in the green. While this could have profitably been used to analyse Drayton's poetry, Watson, in an otherwise admirable work, surprisingly dismisses Drayton as a nationalist poet with a string of elite patrons, concluding that 'poetry can be at once, without conflict, a work of pure nature and a work of high sta- tesmanship'.11 On the contrary, I argue that Foly-Olbion reflects the 10 Donald Worster, The Wealth of Nature: Environmental History and the Ecological Imagination (New York 1993) p. 27.

It is the personified geographical fea- tures of the land that recite the course of human history in a poem that is curiously devoid of human beings. The society of hills, rivers, forests, and valleys, with their abundance of flowers and fruit that Drayton describes so vividly, is one without an anthropocentric world-view. Human beings can be accommodated here - indeed, there are descriptions of fishing and fowling in the fens and sheep-rearing in the Cotswolds, but they are part of a system where the human and the non-human are given equal importance and where coexistence allows both to flourish. There seems to be a 'deep ecological' awareness on Drayton's part - a political consciousness and wisdom that is beyond the strictly human perspective, as Poly-Olbion becomes a site of environmental and ethical reflection. In Song III, Salisbury Plain proleptically warns the forests of an impending crisis: . . . Ages there shall rise, So senselesse of the good of their posterities, That of your greatest Groves they scarce shall leave a tree (By which the harmlesse Deere may after sheltred bee) Their luxurie and pride but onely to maintaine, And for your long excesse shall turne ye all to paine. (151-6) In so far as Drayton conveys a sense of the pristine land being abused by human intervention, he is raising the ethical 'why' and 'how' questions of deep ecology. Anthropomorphism counters the grand claims of anthropo- centrism in the poetic space of Poly-Olbion. If we are to believe Drayton's contemporary Francis Meres, Poly-Olbion was begun around 1598, although the first part was published in 1612 and the second part in 1622. Given the long gestation period of the work, and with a literary career spanning the Elizabethan, Jacobean, and Caroline ages, Drayton was in a unique position to reflect on, as well as anticipate, England's economic metamorphosis. However, it is also important to bear in mind that ecological, economic, and political history are often hard to dis- tinguish during a period of radical change in the rural economy, when unpre- cedented demographic growth, rising prices, enclosures, the depopulation of villages, disafforestation projects, and profound alterations in the distribution of land marked England's transformation towards a market economy.12 12 David Underdown.

A growing population and escalating prices compelled individuals to devise more economical ways of using their land, but this was also the principal reason behind rising discontent and protests. Thomas Fuller complained, 'Rich men to make room for themselves, would jostle the poor people out of their commons.'13 When James I passed through Northamptonshire in 1603, crowds protested against the recent enclosures by Sir John Spencer and other 'wolfish lords that have eaten up poor husbandmen like sheep':14 four years later there was a full- fledged revolt in the area. 'Engrossing' was equally problematic, when two or more farmhouses were amalgamated for occupation by one farmer with the superfluous farmhouses reduced to cottages or left to decay. In the Decaye of England only by the great multitude of shepe (1550-3) there are references to Midland counties such as Northamptonshire where evicted villagers were driven to begging and stealing.15 Another form of expropriation was the enclosure for large-scale farming of the commons formerly open to public use for sports and rural festivals. Between 1615 and 1622 there were riots at Osmington in Dorset concerning a field called the 'bowling green' which the manorial lord John Warham had enclosed, refusing access to the villagers to walk and bowl.16 There were many complex motives and incentives behind these enclosures, but they worked their worst effects in one consolidated belt stretching from the western half of Lincolnshire through Northamptonshire and Leicestershire to Warwickshire and reaching further south to Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. Consequently there were many deserted villages, particularly in the uplands, the chalk wolds, and the limestone and Cotswold hills of the Midlands.17 Robert Powell's Depopulation Arraigned (1636) gives a description of a desolate landscape 13 Ibid, p. 19.

See Joan Thirsk, Tudor Enclosures , Historical Association pamphlet 41 (London 1958; rcpr. 1963) pp. 10-12. Although the most ruthless enclosures had occurred before the reign of Henry VII, the number of statutes, enclosure commissions, and proclamations against enclosures from 1489 to 1607 bears testimony to the fact that they were a major economic and social problem in the Midlands right up to the early seventeenth century.</page><page sequence="7">158 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY after enclosure: 'nothing remains but a champant wildernesse for sheepe, with a Cote, a pastoral boy, his dogge, a crooke and a pipe'.18 Though actual forest riots occurred only in the late 1620s beginning with the erup- tion of Gillingham Forest in 1626 and culminating in the Forest of Dean riot in 1631, there were other sites of resistance much earlier in the century, for instance the 1607 Midlands Revolt. It is perhaps no accident that Drayton chooses to mention the agricultural rebellions of Cornwall and Kett in Song XXII: ... or that of Cornwall call'd, Inclosures to cast downe, which overmuch enthrald The Subject: or proud Kets , who with the same pretence In Norfolkę rais'd such stirres . . . (1593-6) There seems to be a particular reason behind Drayton choosing to mention the Cornwall rising of 1548 and Kett's Rebellion (1549): in both cases the unrest was marked by an innate conservatism wishing for an end to new farming practices such as enclosure. A more com- mercial, enterprising spirit in agriculture eroded not only woodlands, but also a whole sense of community life, of gleaning, playing rural sports, and picking berries on the commons. It is in revolts of this kind that one may see how social disorder and environmentalism engage with each other in a dialogic relationship. The chorographical poem, by its methodology of moving from county to county, is thus able to discover topics in places. Jonathan Bate points out that 'the dilemma of green reading is that it must, yet it cannot separate ecopoetics from ecopolitics'.19 This dilemma is particularly evident in a text like Póly-Olbion. The title page alerts the reader to the poem's complex generic composition as well as its 'epical preoccupation with the genesis of a nation':20 A Chorographicall Description of Tracts, Rivers, Mountains, Forests and other Parts of the Renowned Isle of Greate Britaine with inter- mixture of the most Remarquable Stories, Antiquities, Wonders, 18 James Turner, The PbMcs of Landscape: Rural Scenery and Society in English Poetry 1630-1660 (Oxford 1979) p. 55.

Drayton also introduces a wandering 'Muse' who takes the place of an epic hero and participates actively in the proceedings. With a cartographer's accuracy she charts every mountain, forest, river, and tract, and plays a major role in Drayton's endeavour to weave together the mul- tiple strands in Poly-Olbion . Identified with the spirit of Albion, she is seen as leading the poet over the length and breadth of Britain while empower- ing the hills and valleys with the gift of speech. At times, Drayton puts himself, as it were, at one remove from the composition of the text and attributes it directly to his active Muse. She is credited with the poet's utterance more directly than is normally the case, and here Drayton puts forward a new poetic model and purpose. Fbly-Olbion's title page not only highlights the generic admixture in the poem but also points to Drayton's political intentions. Drayton's use of the term 'chorographicall' is significant and suggestive. Richard Helgerson has persuasively argued that long chorographical descriptions left little space for the representation of royal power, and Drayton's poem thus expresses 'more openly than any of the others, the new social and political values'.22 By emphasising the importance of the land, Drayton invests the personified geographical features with values that are absent in the exist- ing monarch and his court. As will be explored later, in Foly-Olbion , Drayton creates a mythology to back up the ethos and ideology of the Country party. This 'decentering of the court'23 had already begun in Drayton's earlier pastoral poetry, but in Pbly-Olbion he extends the function of the formal pastorals by infusing the account of nature and antiquity with a strong political purpose, a point acknowledged by Paula Johnson, who states that Toly-Olbion is not a kingdom but a nation, hierarchically ordered but with nobody at the top'.24 21 Works , vol. iv, p. i*.

Kate Soper has pointed out how nature was almost always depicted as Temale', con- ceived as spatial territory and as the land or the earth that is tamed and violated.25 By presenting Albion as a woman, Drayton seems to be paving the way for the numerous descriptions of the rape of the land in Pbly-Olbion. This symbolic figure of the fronds piece, seated on a rocky throne surrounded by the sea, is a personification of the land itself, and depicted as the ruling force. Even the maps accompanying the description of each county contain figures that are personifications of the place itself rather than being representative rustics. As the personified geographical features of the landscape narrate the course of human history, human beings only play their part before these recording presences. The Greek word 'poly' in the title of the poem implies a celebration of the sheer variety of the land. The topological, pastoral, and georgic conventions used by Drayton are given an entirely new voice in Pbly-Olbion by being invested with a deeper environmental significance. Alastair Fowler points out that, around 1600, the georgic poem was conceived as 'digressive ... It might touch on labour and the retired life of the country, comparison of historical periods, seasonal change or landscape description.'26 In Foly-Olbion , parts of the poem conform to this outline, but it is not really georgic in the basic Virgilian sense. In Song XIII, for instance, there is a description of the Warwickshire landscape, a vivid account of British birds, and a glimpse of a hermit who combines a retired country life with a keen botanical inter- est in different herbs. Thus Drayton combines the classic georgic with the landscape poem and the simple didactic poem for a definite purpose: to make a serious ecological and ethical claim. This is perhaps even more evident in his use of pastoral elements in the poem. Drayton moves back to the landscape itself, mythologised to yield a fundamental primitivism. This has a prescriptive function: the imaginary topography shows us not only a vision of the land but also a theory of its proper use. The non-human environment is present not merely as a framing device but as a presence that seems to suggest that human history is implicated in natural history. The rivers and forests become the most articulate local historians who recollect the past but also prophesy the 25 Kate Soper, 'Naturalised Woman and Feminised Nature', in Laurence Coupe (ed.), The Green Studies Reader: Frnn Romanticism to Ecocriticism (London 2000) p. 14.

By presenting a landscape devoid of human presence, Drayton moves back onto a plane where the land appears in its most pristine form; he tries to find a voice beyond and before history when nature was unpeopled, when the mountains were young. Indeed, one of the most noticeable aspects of Foly-Olbion is the near-complete absence of human characters. Nymphs and shepherds do not inhabit the forests and valleys but are the forests and hills themselves, as Drayton replaces human charac- ters with personified and deified features of the landscape. This device was not new in the literary tradition - nymphs and satyrs enliven the landscapes of Ovidian poetry and Spenser practises a similar vein of mythopoeia in The Faerie Queene - but Drayton's purpose is very different. For him, going back to the past is not just a return to a prior community, but even before that to the tranquil land, which is free from human habi- tation and exploitation. In the poem there are flocks of sheep but no herdsmen; in Song XXX, for instance, animals roam freely but there are no humans who dominate over them or are their authoritative guardians: The blushing morne to breake, but hardly doth begin, But that the ramping Goats, swift Deere, and harmlesse Sheepe, Which there their owners know, but no man hath to keepe. (244-6) This Golden Age-like description is significandy juxtaposed with passages of bitter satire where Drayton rants against the 'Bestiali Rout and Boorish rabblemenť of - 'rude vulgar sots' (6-7). The life and society of the per- sonified features of the land thus provide an analogue for an ideal human society. Drayton gives nature an intrinsic value in and of itself, indepen- dent of its function for human society, and this becomes a framework for a future human society. Each feature of the landscape is seen to have its inherent point of view. For instance, valleys like the Vale of Evesham defend themselves against 'Those high presumptuous Hills' by citing the abundance of their own fruitful meadows (Xiy 81-1 14), but these valleys and hills are ultimately interde- pendent. In Songs IV and y history is presented in an extension of the tra- ditional 'debates' of pastoral eclogues, with English and Welsh river muses arguing over the possession of the Isle of Lundy. Foly-Olbion offers the picture of a land whose features are constantly shifting and changing, yet it is the rec- ognition that the beauty of a particular place must coexist with that of others that prevents the land from disintegrating. Throughout Foly-Olbion , the dis- tinctive quality of Drayton's pastoral is the ease and felicity with which he combines the real and the mythical. If Spenser uses the topological pastoral</page><page sequence="11">162 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY genre for decorative purposes in The Faerie Queene , and as a complement to the main action, Drayton uses it as a principal device. Hence Poly-Olbion uses conventional features of pastoral and georgic in order to generate itself as a unique vehicle of political and ecological concerns. Pöly-Olbion also incorporates a number of explicitly satirical passages where Drayton laments the destruction of the pristine landscape. Capitalist enterprise and the avarice of men leave scars on the land itself. Drayton never tires of denouncing the 'caitifes', the 'lunatics and fooles' who are responsible for the huckstering of the land and its inevitable destruction. In his growing aversion to James I, Drayton shared the feelings of many of his peers who were alienated from the court and who had 'Country' leanings. The term 'Country' carried with it certain ideological connotations and represented a culture that was confined to the counties of England as opposed to the sophistication of changing fashions at court. Although the standard pastoral topos of a court/country duality is evoked here, the land understands the mutual respect necessary between the sovereign and his subjects, and it is in this that a general 'Country' and parliamentary ideol- ogy may be detected. For instance, in Songs VIII and IX, Snowdon recon- ciles the factions among the rivers and nymphs, while in Song VII Malvern Hill rules its subjects with graciousness. There are political ramifications of these instructive lessons for policy. Rather than history being imposed by humans on the landscape, history has to be distilled from the landscape, and political exempla are topographically presented. Drayton's political concerns and his affiliation with the oppositionist politics of the time are often reflected in and through his ecological concerns. In Song XIX, for example, Waltham Forest rails against the men 'who having sold our woods, doe lastly sell our soyle' (48) and laments the fact that the displaced birds who welcome in the spring have no place to perch themselves and are forced to 'sit upon the ground' (59). Foly-Olbion offers the picture of a land whose features are constantly in a state of flux, a point noted by Raphael Lyne, who contends that there is 'a difficult coexistence of strict physical parameters for the poem's charac- ters, combined with something of Ovid's flexible, changing world'.27 At the very beginning, in Song I, Mount Michael's Bay in Cornwall speaks of 'strange things' that have come to pass: 'That fortie miles now Sea, sometimes firme fore-land was; | And that a Forrest then, which now with him is Flood' (98-9). In Song XVI, the River Lea, for instance, is con- soled that though she is now a mere brook her case is not unique, for 27 Raphael Lyne, Ovid's Changing Ubrlds: English Metamorphoses 1567-1632 (Oxford 2001) p. 179.</page><page sequence="12">DRAYTON'S 'SILENT SPRING' 163 'Where rivers sometimes ran, is firm and certain ground: | And where before were Hills, now standing Lakes are found' (303-4). In the same song we are told that Whethamsted, which used to be known for the ferti- lity of its soil, has been reduced to 'a hot and hungry sand' (35). Yet, there are reasons for these instances of soil erosion, one of them being disaffor- estation. James I, for instance, contemplating selling off part of the Crown forests, ordered foresters to survey the standing oaks in the royal domain, and despite expressed public concern proceeded regularly to sell royal woodlands that were either transformed to arable land or used to supply wood for shipbuilding.28 Drayton's most powerful invectives are reserved for those who are responsible for the destruction of the forests, which is seen to be the prime cause of the desert-like landscape that threatens to encroach upon these rural retreats. Song XVII contains one of the longest and most cogent laments by the 'daughters of the Weald', who describe their violent destruction in these 'yron times': Foreseeing, their decay each howre so fast came on, Under the axes stroak, fetcht many a grievous grone, When as the anviles weight, and hammers dreadfull sound, Even rent the hollow Woods, and shook the queachy ground. Joves Oke, the warlike Ash, veyn'd Eime, the softer Beech, Short Hazell, Maple plaine, light Aspe, the bending Wych, Tough Holly, and smooth Birch, must altogether burne: What should the Builder serve, supplies the Forger's turne; When under publike good, base private gaine takes holde, And we poore woefull Woods, to ruine lastly solde. (381-4, 403-8) In early iron-making industries, charcoal was used as fuel for smelting and forging and required a ready supply of wood.29 The references to the tools of manufacture as instruments of this violence symbolically represent a dialectic between the private gain of man and nature. The catalogue of timber-yielding trees described so poetically by Drayton ends with the 28 The returns of the survey showed oak trees valued at £90,000 . The sale of royal forests continued throughout the reigns of James I and Charles I. In the 1620s Charles sold two royal forests to pay the fleet on its return from the La Rochelle expedition.

Similarly, the River Frome laments the lack of foresight on the part of men: deforestation will cause climatic change since the oaks, now reduced to 'shrubs', can no longer protect the land and its creatures from the winter sleet or the sudden gusts from the sea.30 The Wyre Forest in Song VII gives a frighteningly barren description of her current state: the forest is ransacked, the deer have been replaced by carrion and swine, all the branches of the trees are chopped off, and 'Their Trunkes (like aged folkes) now bare and naked stand, | As for revenge to heaven each held a withered hand' (295-6). In The Pbetics of English Nationhood, Claire McEachern contends that Drayton's depiction of a land that is fragile and mutable, eroding and deforested, points to his engagement with a pressing political issue: the proposed union of England and Scotland.31 I suggest that Drayton had in mind what was to him a far more pressing issue: the urge to conserve a landscape in the face of rapid agricultural change. The sheer desolation of these descriptions encapsulates Drayton's clarion call for the preservation of the land, and he seems to have had an acute environmental sensitivity about the importance of the preservation of forests. Thus, within the lyric framework of the song, Drayton's satirical attitude and ecological concerns could be voiced. The historiography of forests has a long past, and along with agricultural history may be one of the longest-running historical topics having to do with natural resources. John Manwood, a lawyer and forest official during Elizabeth I's reign, was also a kind of proto-environmentalist who wrote Treatise and Discourse of the Laws of the Forrests (1598) to protect the royal forests from over-grazing and over-hunting. In his 1656 book Practical Husbandly Improved , Gabriel Plattes apprehended a potential domestic timber crisis, as did John Evelyn in his Silva: A Discourse of Forest Trees (1664), which was part arboreal appreciation and part handbook for planting.32 More recently, Christopher Burlinson has re-examined the process of Irish deforestation in Spenser's time in the light of twentieth-century theories of the production 30 Sec Song II, 69-71.

He cogently argues that forests in Spenser's work are not just a symbolic background to events but that they gain material weight as 'spaces that are produced, destroyed or maintained by human intervention'. This raises questions as to whether our attention to these landscapes results in a consciousness of the natural world or a historical critique of our part in it.33 What distinguishes Drayton, however, is not merely an awareness and cri- tique of deforestation, but an attempt to write a text that draws attention to the particular 'bio-regions' of each English county and a consequent emphasis on the need for conservation. Drayton also adopts another method to formulate his environmentalist plea for conservation. Juxtaposed with the satirical passages are idyllic passages where the paradisal quality of the land is emphasised. Here the close scrutiny of nature seems to become a serious and sufficient poetic goal. In a deliberate, politically charged withdrawal from human society, Drayton concentrates on taxonomie descriptions and lists of flowers, herbs, fish, and birds which seem apparently apolitical; yet they become an unlikely but unique vehicle of his political and ecological concerns. Rather than offering a direct criticism of land expropriation, Drayton opts to make an impassioned plea for the conservation of the natural habitat in each county. In Song XIII, where there is a description of his native Warwickshire, this plea becomes even more intense and urgent. Here Drayton provides a long catalogue of birds: To Philomell the next, the Linet we prefer; And by that warbling bird, the Wood-Larke place we then, The Red-sparrow, the Nope, the Red-breast, and the Wren, The Yellow-pate: which though shee hurt the blooming tree, Yet scarce hath any bird a finer pype than shee. And of these chaunting Fowles, the Goldfinch not behind, That hath so many sorts descending from her kind. The Tydie for her notes as delicate as they, The laughing Hecco, then the counterfeiting Jay . . . (72-80) Drayton is not merely taking an ornithologist's delight in cataloguing these names. The characteristics of each type of bird are emphasised as he lists them according to their voices, distinctive colours, and appearance: nature has given the woosell its golden bill, the yellow-pate its fine pipe, and the 33 Christopher Burlinson, Allegory Space and the Materìal World in the Writings of Edmund Spenser (Cambridge 2006) pp. 169-70.</page><page sequence="15">166 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY titmouse (tydie) its delicate tone. Here, the poetry itself enacts conservation: there is a sense of urgency to preserve these species, born of a realisation that man's physical environment has a bearing on his intellectual character and his future survival. The literary descriptions of nature result in a renewed consciousness of the natural world. The inherent 'naturalness' of the environments described is deployed to point to the 'unnaturalness' and corruption of wasteful and luxurious city lifestyles. As the birds begin their morning song, the hills, the valleys, and the very air echo with their music. Yet it is a music that is constantly threatened by the sound of hewing timber and the destruction of the forests that serve as a home to these birds. The loss of birdsong in these ancient forests functions as a synecdoche for a more general environmental apocalypse of the kind envisaged by Rachel Carson in Silent Spring. 'It was a spring without voices. On the mornings that had once throbbed with the dawn chorus of robins, catbirds, doves . . . there was now no sound; only silence lay over the fields and woods and marsh.'34 In the same song Drayton provides, almost with botanical precision, a long and poetic catalogue of herbs found in the forest. Besides the usual yarrow, chickweed, and 'wonder-working Dill', the forest is a virtual store- house of medicinal herbs, yielding many unknown even to Gerard and Dodon, the authors of two famous herbáis. Drayton implicitly suggests that these fragile herbs with their natural healing properties have to be preserved in their habitat away from man's rapacious exploitation of the land. Catalogues of trees and plants are found in Chaucer and Spenser, but for Drayton these have profound political and ecological implications. In his account of the wedding of the Isis and the Thames in Song XV there are passages of pure lyric description. As Oxford's spires tower over the meadows, the rural muses are invoked and the marriage between the two rivers becomes an excuse to showcase all the flowers that bloom in the Cotswold area. Flowers of the meadows and pastures mingle with garden flowers and fragrant herbs such as marjoram, basil, rosemary, camomile, and mint, as Drayton relishes the sheer beauty of the names, piling them in an almost unending catalogue: The brave Carnation then, with sweet and soveraigne power (So of his colour call'd, although a July-flower) With th'other of his kinde, the speckled and the pale: Then th'odoriferous Pink, that sends forth such a gale Of sweetness; yet in sents, as various as in sorts. The purple Violet then, the Pansie there supports: 34 Rachel Carson, Silent Spring (New York 1962) p. 2.</page><page sequence="16">DRAYTON'S 'SILENT SPRING' 167 The Mary-gold above ťadorne the arched Bar: The dubbie Daysie, Thrift, the Button-batcheler, Sweet William, Sops in wine, the Campion: and to these, Some Lavander they put, with Rosemary and Bayes. (177-86) In this long list, Drayton seems to have unearthed the names of every possible English flower and revels in their very articulation, but the eco- poetics of such naming cannot be ignored. The description of the delicate shades of the carnation, the variety in the intoxicating fragrance of the pinks, the climbing marigold, and the vivid purple violet all bear testi- mony to the fact that for Drayton writing advocates conservation. In Poly-Olbion the English rural setting is specifically evoked but ideal- ised and transformed for a political-ecological purpose, as it never is in Browne and other writers of pastoral.35 Drayton must have been aware of the fact that it was the woodland and pasture areas that were vulnerable to economic fluctuations and linked to an expanding market economy. With the commons being enclosed for sheep pasturage, entire villages were dismantled, and this would invariably lead to the destruction of the flora and fauna of the region. The catalogue of flowers, ranging from the humble cowslip to the more exotic marigolds and pansies, suggests Drayton's acute awareness of the troubling changes in land use. In Song XXV catalogues are used once again to highlight the natural fauna and indigenous fish and fowl of the fens. One of early modern England's most significant and heavily capitalised projects in the eastern counties was the drainage of the fens. This had profound social, political and environmental implications since it led to the disappearance of the old fenland economy and aroused determined public opposition, expressed in rioting and the breaking of dikes and sluices.36 In 1600 par- liament passed the General Draining Act for the reclamation of 'wastes, commons, marshes, and fenny grounds there subject to surrounding [flooding]' in the hope of 'recovering many hundred thousand Acres of marshes'.37 The drainage works were commissioned by wealthy London investors and venture capitalists led by the fourth earl of Bedford, who planned to reap a profit by selling off the newly arable (and hence much more valuable) common fenlands they sought to drain. Yet the story of 35 Similar idealised descriptions may be found in contemporary pastoral works, for instance the description of Ina's Coombe in William Browne of Tavistock's Brìtannia's Pastorals. 36 See Keith Lindley, Fenland Riots and the English Revolution (London 1982). 7 H.

If Warwickshire's Arden was home to a plethora of forest birds, the fens are the abode of water birds: the mallards, gossan- ders, coots, water-woosells, and puffins that inhabit this marshy region (Song XXV). They also contain a huge variety of fish, ranging from the herring and the cod to the exotic sturgeon and oyster. By providing a lengthy list of the different species of fish and fowl, Drayton also obliquely points to the irretrievable loss and extensive damage to the environment that would result if the drainage projects persisted. Thus he provides the picture of a potentially fragile ecosystem constandy under the threat of erasure. As part of a new, environment-driven agenda, Drayton catalogues herbs, flowers, and so on in an attempt to highlight existing or potential environmental deterioration and the loss of biodiversity. These catalogues, scattered as they are over descriptions of various counties, serve as a poignant appeal for the conservation of the local environment. Drayton's use of Erasmian 'copia'38 and the rhetoric of praise in these catalogues of flora and fauna point to a Utopian archaic economy of abundance and self-sufficiency, untainted by the corruption associated with monetary exchange. The region around Mendip is so plentiful, for instance, that in Song III Drayton compares it to a 'rich mans house' that has provision of all food and commodities: There Banquet houses, Walkes for pleasure; here againe Cribs, Graners, Stables, Barnes, the other to maintaine: So this rich countrey hath, it selfe what may suffice; Or that which through exchange a smaller want supplies: (257-60) In Song VIII, Drayton envisages the pre-capitalist economy in the past that was not ravaged by need and greed: Where scarce a Strangers foote defil'd her virgin breast, Since her first Conqueror Brute heere put his powers to rest; 38 It may be noted that in the poem Drayton made extensive use of the copious style as advocated by Erasmus in his De duplici copia verborum oc rerum. Following the idea of 'copia* or abundance that was also represented through the myth of cornucopia or the horn of plenty, many Renaissance writers wrote in a flowing, copious style. The long catalogues of flora and fauna in Drayton's poem present the idea of an abundance of things that calls for an equal abundance of words.</page><page sequence="18">DRAYTON'S SILENT SPRING' 169 Onely some little Boats, from Gaul that did her feed With tryfles, which shee tooke for nicenesse more then need: But as another world, with all abundance blest, And satisfi'd with what shee in her selfe possest; Through her excessive wealth (at length) till wanton growne . . . (171-7) Pierre Bourdieu has suggested that in such exchanges, where the invest- ment is of honour and emotion, it is the 'symbolic capital' that far out- weighs the calculations of a materialist economy. An excessive show of wealth and self-sufficiency is manifested through exchange of gifts as in a marriage. As Bourdieu points out: 'Measured by the yardstick of monet- ary profit, the most sacred activities find themselves constituted negatively as symbolic.'39 The economy of gift is lucidly expressed in the story of the marriage of the Isis and the Thames in Song XV: To Oxford got before, to entertaine the Flood, Apollo's ayde he begs, with all his sacred brood, To that most learned place to welcome her repaire. On whom their severall gifts (to amplifie her dowre) The Muses there bestowe (77-9, 83-4) The mother of the groom is the fruitful Vale of Alsbury, who, in her 'lavish charge' and 'prodigali expense', is determined to excel Cotswold, the father of the bride. The bridewealth (the price given by the groom to the bride's family in tribal societies), the great number of guests, and the ostentatious gifts - nothing is lacking in this description to underline the importance of symbolic capital in this archaic economy, which is seen as an alternative to the capitalist economy that England was inevitably and relentlessly moving towards. In Fbly-Olbiorís society, the logic of 39 See Pierre Bourdieu, The Logu: of Practice , trans. Richard Nice (Stanford 1990) p. 119: 'It is clear why the great families never miss an opportunity to organise exhibitions of symbolic capital - processions of kinsmen and allies which solemnise the pilgrim's departure or return, the bride's escort, measured by the number of "rifles" and the intensity of the salutes fired in the couple's honour, prestigious gifts, like the sheep given for a wedding, the witnesses and guarantors who can be mobilised at any time and any place, to attest the good faith of a transaction or to strengthen the hand of the lineage in negotiating a marriage and solemnise the contract.'</page><page sequence="19">170 THE CAMBRIDGE QUARTERLY expropriation is blissfully absent. Drayton offers us a vision of a land of abundance, free from the divisive forces of the market. It is a land where the features of the landscape with its distinctive flora and fauna can exist in harmony. At the same time there is also an acute awareness of the vul- nerability of this utopia. Awareness about the environment, the ethical and ecological impli- cations of deforestation, and the urgent need for conservation are not something new in today's world. W G. Hoskins's groundbreaking The Making of the English Landscape (1955) was later expanded upon by Oliver Rackham in his exploration of the historical nomenclature of woodlands and their management in his now classic Trees and Woodlands in the British Landscape (1976). Today we have more established formal protocols, such as the 'Forest Principles' document adopted at the Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro, and movements such as Chipko in northern India.40 Yet Drayton seems to have been acutely aware of these problems nearly 400 years ago, when woodlands were being destroyed in the vicinity of towns where there was a profitable market for foodstuffs. We may never know whether Drayton had any specific 'green programme' in mind when he wrote Ibly-Olbion, but in our era of globalisation there is no doubt that the environment is constantly under threat and the loss of biodiversity has reached such alarming proportions that we require ratified documents like the Biodiversity Convention, the Framework Convention on Climate Change, or the Berne Convention to protect wild flora and fauna in their natural habitats. Drayton's generic manipulations and his reorientation of the pastoral, epic, and georgic modes were intended to contextualise poetic conven- tions in terms of the ecological concerns of his day. This sets him apart from other Elizabethan and Jacobean poets who were using similar con- ventions. At the same time, Poly-Olbion sufficiendy proves the impossibility 40 The 'Forest Principles' document states: 'The vital role of all types of forests in maintaining the ecological processes and balance at the local, national, regional and global levels through, inter alia, their role in protecting fragile ecosystems, watersheds and freshwater resources and as rich storehouses of biodiversity and biological resources and sources of genetic material for biotechnology products, as well as photosynthesis, should be recognised.' From their origins as a spontaneous protest against logging abuses in Uttar Pradesh in the Himalayas, thousands of supporters of the Chipko movement, mainly village women, have won bans on clear felling in a number of regions and influenced natural resource policy in India. The name of the movement comes from a word meaning 'embrace'. The women practised satyagraha - non-violent resistance - and interposed their bodies between the trees and the contractors' axes, thus becoming the environmental movement's first tree-huggers.</page><page sequence="20">DRAYTON'S 'SILENT SPRING' 1 7 1 of Jonathan Bate's desire to separate ecopolitics and ecopoetics. Bate's claims that ecopoetics should be regarded as 'pre-poli ticaP, and that it would be 'quixotic to suppose that a work of literary criticism might be an appropriate place in which to spell out a practical programme for better environmental management' are belied by a text like Poly-Olbion^ In Drayton's work, politics and an acute awareness of the environment are not antithetical, but inextricably linked. As Gabriel Egan points out in his book Green Shakespeare , 'the greatest critical dividends occur when one can show how the two discourses, the literary and the political, are mutually reinforcing'.42 In the imaginative projection of a depopulated landscape that is nevertheless teeming with personified geographical features, Foly-Olbion becomes an unlikely but unique vehicle of political concerns, where the ecopolitical resonances of the poetics permeate the entire text. 41 Jonathan Bate, The Song of the Earthy p. 266.
