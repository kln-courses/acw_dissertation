         <p>OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST CENTURY, scientists and scholars have repeatedly invoked the naturalistic fallacy as a means of casting aspersions on logical errors in others’ naturalistic reasoning. Such calls to police the boundary between nature and morality—like that of G. E. Moore, who coined the term in 1903—have largely succeeded in codifying the idea that nature and morality exist as necessarily separate entities and, thus, demand an interpretive framework to travel from one to the other.<sup>1</sup> As the following collection of essays demonstrates, however, this simple term has masked a great deal of conceptual diversity in how epistemic cultures since at least the Greeks have sought to disentangle deeply entwined concepts like nature and nurture, biology and culture, body and soul, or contingency and design. In the words of philosopher Philip Kitcher, “there is … no such thing as <italic>the</italic> naturalistic fallacy.”<sup>2</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Historians of science have carefully attended to questions of naturalistic reasoning by historicizing particular claims to the moral authority of nature.<sup>3</sup> These analyses reveal how the cultures we study have authorized implicit social norms through their appeals to nature, especially regarding human and animal natures, sexual and racial differences, and cosmological order. Each of these long-standing concepts has its own convoluted history, both inside and beyond the Western tradition.<sup>4</sup> Embedded in these examples of naturalism past are repeated contemporary calls for restraint when expounding moral lessons, prompted by either the content of the message or the process by which it had been derived. Advocacy and admonition commingle, yet far less historical attention has concentrated on the latter. Each essay in this Focus section explores a different historical episode in which naturalistic reasoning has been questioned in order to shed new light on the persistence of naturalism itself—a history of science as told from the borderlands.</p>
         <p>We begin in the late fourth and early third centuries <sc>b.c.e.</sc>, with the rise of Hellenistic ethics. As a school of philosophical thought, Stoicism remained popular throughout antiquity, becoming an important component in the training of many elite young Romans before their service in the Senate. In her essay, Brooke Holmes argues that the Stoic conception of <italic>oikeiōsis</italic>—the process by which nature imbued animals and humans with the capacity for self-care—affirmed the agency of both nature and self in determining an individual’s destiny.<sup>5</sup> She terms this philosophical intertwining a “naturalistic fantasy” in which humans could live simultaneously according to nature’s precepts and their own will. For the Stoics, to succeed in this careful balance was to live properly. Holmes’s essay thus explores the fruitful intellectual landscape within which ancient philosophers sought to navigate between concepts of reason, ethics, and nature.</p>
         <p>Scholars in the Western tradition continued to wrestle with these same concepts as the symbolic meanings of nature diversified.<sup>6</sup> Animals, in particular, occupied positions of considerable power within naturalistic readings of the world by embodying an untaught yet active nature.<sup>7</sup> If equally untaught infants ideally developed into rational ethical adults, animals by comparison largely maintained their unproblematic status as natural models throughout their lives. From the late antique <italic>Physiologus</italic> through later medieval bestiaries, animals’ behaviors provided scholars with allegorical clues to leading a moral life.<sup>8</sup> Nature thus allowed careful observers to glimpse the divine order of God’s creation, across the Latin West and the Byzantine and Islamic worlds.

         <p>Within modern science, natural philosophers expanded and began to reconceptualize the interpretive space between morality and nature, a development Lorraine Daston cogently encapsulates in her essay. She traces the political vicissitudes of nature as a touchstone from progressive reformers in the eighteenth century to conservative defenders of tradition by the mid-nineteenth century. Slowly divorced from moral agency, nature simply was. It took epistemological work to reconnect this deracinated nature with the ethical realm of human culture and values. When they tried to forge such links, natural philosophers and, later, scientists found themselves exposed to new charges of making false inferences. By thus placing the historical origins of the “naturalistic fallacy” in the context of a widening divide between nature and morality, Daston suggests that invocations of it as a universal category have flattened our appreciation of the wide variability in naturalistic (and antinaturalistic) reasoning.</p>
         <p>The secularization of public discourse and the professionalization of the human sciences thus ostensibly worked hand in hand to cleave questions of goodness and morality from the natural sciences.<sup>9</sup> Such questions instead came firmly under the purview of private personal religious conviction or, when public, the jurisdiction of social scientists.<sup>10</sup> Even this generalization, though, glosses over the moral concerns of natural scientists following World War II. Many life scientists hoped that the pursuit of truth uncontaminated by political or religious ideology would provide a noble democratic ethic in both form and content—and in so doing found themselves accused of having committed “the naturalistic fallacy.”<sup>11</sup> Physical scientists, on the other hand, reacted by redoubling their efforts to cleanse their field of claims about the natural origins of social order.</p>
         <p>Matthew Stanley analyzes this bifurcated legacy in the physical sciences by providing a fascinating example of an elision between “is” and “ought” in naturalistic cosmological reasoning in late twentieth-century physics—the anthropic principle. By the turn of the last century, he notes, cosmologists had begun relying on the professionalizing social sciences as an intermediary when moving between their physical theories and assertions of naturalistic social, ethical, or moral value. Advocates of a strong anthropic principle believed that the precise concatenation of the numerous physical factors allowing the existence of intelligent life must be more than mere coincidence. Stanley posits that their vision of the universe subtly switched the basis of naturalistic reasoning from “ought” to “is.” In a sense, then, the anthropic principle both saturates nature with an absolute prescription for our cosmological destiny while simultaneously removing all forms of agency, yielding a designed world without a designer.<sup>12</sup>
         </p>
         <p>My own essay turns to a curious case of naturalistic reasoning in the life sciences of the 1980s. By then, evolutionary theory was embroiled in a heated battle over the normative social claims embedded in sociobiological analyses of animal and human behavior.<sup>13</sup> Biologist Robert Trivers and Huey P. Newton, cofounder of the Black Panthers, argued together that self-deception in humans should be seen as a naturally selected behavioral trait rather than a psychological mismatch between the external world and our perceptions of it. At the time, few scientists paid attention to their argument—an important reminder, I suggest, that even in light of the long history of naturalistic reasoning and accusations as to its moral missteps, attempts to invoke a naturalistic origin for a specific phenomenon often fail to gain traction within a scholarly community. In subsequent years, postmodern critiques of science additionally led many social scientists to greet any case of naturalistic reasoning about human behavior with great skepticism.<sup>14</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Still other social scientists found immunological or neurobiological theories, for example, fertile ground for theorizing the human condition.<sup>15</sup> Warwick Anderson’s essay reckons with the mechanisms by which immunologists drew on philosophical concepts in a kind of “sociological fallacy” that preceded the widespread adoption of immunological reasoning by social theorists. In his analysis, dense mutual appropriations between the social and the natural work in both directions, a traffic obscured if we concentrate solely on attempts to reason from nature to culture. Through the lens of immunological philosophy, Anderson suggests that all accusations of naturalistic fallacies ultimately reinforce a binary conception of nature as an entity that can and should stand independently of the cultural context in which we study it.</p>
         <p>By historicizing a series of concerns that now fall under the single rubric of “<italic>the</italic> naturalistic fallacy,” our essays document some of the contingent attractions to naturalistic reasoning at different historical moments and question the premise that such naturalism must inevitably be fallacious. Of course, even if naturalistic arguments are made all the time, many are ignored—and even fewer are attacked. In highlighting the naturalistic fallacy as a negative category, we additionally show how the term itself has become resonant across the political spectrum—from liberal and conservative attempts to maintain the political status quo to resounding calls for action by revolutionaries and reactionaries alike. These essays characterize invocations of naturalistic fallacies as peculiar, persistent, and, above all, polymorphous.</p>
