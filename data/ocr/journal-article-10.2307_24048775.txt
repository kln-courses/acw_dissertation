Conclusion The ossuary ritual may have been practiced in Sogdiana by the late fourth century-first half of the fifth century, at least fifty to one hundred years before the generally accepted date (the turn of the fifth and sixth centuries). It is likely that the earliest form was burials in jars and, evi dently, also in ossuaries in Samarkand. The first known ossuary burials appear in the late fifth or early sixth century in the three urban centers of Samarkand, Panjikent, and Er-kurgan. There does not appear to have been a wholesale adop tion of ossuary ritual throughout the territory of Sogdiana before the seventh century. In Sogdi ana, the ossuary ritual appears to have taken place first in urban areas. Some time ago, Β. IA. Staviskii proposed a chronological development of Sogdian ossuaries from the rectangular Biya-Naiman type to that fashioned of oval layered strips. The reason for this, in his opinion, was the simplification of the technological process. The accumulation of new materials and recent archaeological research al ters this chronological scheme radically. In Sog diana the earliest type of ossuary, built from layered strips and rectangular or oval in shape, remained in use throughout the entire early me dieval period (from the fifth or sixth century to the first half of the eighth century). Ossuaries of the Biya-Naiman type that were produced from stamped rectangular slabs and were supplied with pyramidal lids came later. The evolution of the shape of Sogdian ossuaries was due not to simplification of the technological process but to adoption of new techniques, and the develop ment of rectangular slab-molded ossuaries (the Biya-Naiman type) was related to the use of large matrices. Territorial peculiarities of Sogdian ossuaries can be discussed beginning only with the sev enth century, and only with regard to central Sog diana. While early Samarkand ossuaries were related to the Hellenistic tradition, the later ex amples reflect a noticeable loss of this connec tion. In general, masks and stylized garlands and arcades disappeared and were replaced by orna mental design similar to the monumental Sog dian decoration of the seventh-eighth centuries. At that time, a new technological and decora tive type of ossuary appeared in the Miyan-qalca area of central Sogdiana, the westernized style of which differed greatly from ossuaries from Sa markand. Stamped ossuaries were concentrated in the western area of central Sogdiana, and none have been found in Panjikent and Samarkand. Some of the Samarkand ossuaries are not inferior in artistic merit to the stamped ossuaries, al though overall their use of iconography is less rich. Their decoration, however, displays more labor-intensive techniques such as carving, hand modeling, etc. The new type of ossuary made by the more progressive method of stamping an impression from a matrix onto a slab, which speeded up the process of production, never caught on in Samarkand, a large handicraft cen ter of Sogdiana, although it was located only nineteen km from Durmen, where that type was produced. Perhaps the new type reflected the re ligious situation in the western area, i.e., the presence of a community that practiced the os suary ritual in a somewhat different way than at Samarkand.
