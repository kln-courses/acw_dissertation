Mediterranean, their own When per- it spective on Europe. When it comes to the Mediterranean, only two places exist. Cannes, kicking off the film festival season, is the shop window where new life goes on display. Spring fever infects producers' wallets, stars' vanity, and directors' egos. Life is young, naïve, and venal. Venice, ending the summer with another junket, is stranger and more cre- puscular. There, films darkly flower before winter closedown. And as fall steals over the lagoon, directors like Paul Schräder come to the tourist-emptied town to make films like The Comfort of Strangers. Cameras turn in the mist; arts mystery unfolds. Six months later- Alakazam!- the completed movie is un- canned at Cannes. The wonderful cycle of movie life continues. "Wonderful" is a word one cant get out of ones head regarding Schräders film. I saw the movie at Cannes. Daz- zled, I went to see it again the next day. With hundreds of movies on view, this is not something you do lightly at a film festival: you wake up screaming every night from dreams in which you're being strangled by thick coils of celluloid. (Dear Dr. Freud, Sometimes a coil of celluloid is just a coil of celluloid.) Not since Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now has any movie filled Venice with such menacing wonder. Not since the heyday of Losey-Pinter has any film so won- drously played off baroque visuals against gnomic dialogue (by Pinter). And in the dawn of a decade in which we may be clubbed senseless by Euro- American movies, what better example could be set than by this Italo-U.S. coproduction, which throws English and American stars at a film produced, scored, photographed, and wardrobed by Italians? (Clothes by Giorgio "Spare that steam-iron" Armani.) But lets not present The Comfort of Strangers merely with a Good Ameri- can-European Relations award. The films triumph is that it consummates Schräders love affair with European cul- ture and cinema. This passion has been ongoing ever since his scriptwriting bap- tism of fire Taxi Driver (inspired by Pickpocket). It has continued through movies like American Gigolo (Sten- dhal's Scarlet and Black), Cat People (Lewtonian Central-European Gothic), and Light of Day (Faust redone as teen rock melodrama). And in Schräders 1979 "Guilty Pleasures" for FILM COM- MENT- no, guest contributors, we never forget- the director had the nerve to list Last Year at Marienbad. Only a Calvin- ist could feel guilty rather than pious about admiring Alain Resnais. In the same article, waxing prophetic about U.S. cinemas continental drift towards Europe, Schräder said this: "Fif- teen years ago, critics led the backlash against European art films in favor of the American cinema. It is ironic that it is now the filmmakers, not the critics, who are leading the counter-backlash toward European cinema. A growing number of American films are turning to the European classics for their stylistic inspiration." That was then, this is now. But time has proved Schräder right, and he's get- ting righter. Today the European impera- tive devolves not just from the way certain American filmmakers like to be bitten by favorite European directors (Woody Allen and Bergman, Schräder and Bresson). Nor from the growing ten- dency for popular U.S. cinema to recycle big European hits ( Three Men and a Baby, Three Fugitives , Cousins). Today the Euro-U.S. accord is motivated mainly by brute film-business logistics. With tariff walls going up around a united Europe in 1992, Hollywood wants to be in place to get a piece of the action. Paramount has already built a bridgehead office in London, and Dis- ney and Universal are breaking ground on either side of the English Channel. All these Euro-factors may mysteri- ously have conspired to place Paul Schräder in Venice, there to make a film produced by Italy's Angelo Rizzoli and scripted by England's Harold Pinter from fellow Englishman Ian McEwan's novel. The whole package was put together by Sovereign Pictures, which specializes in charging round the globe making unlikely international deals. The resulting movie could have been a night- mare; most of these Babel enterprises are. It turns out to be a dream. The turned main the reason standard is, Schräder vice of the has turned the standard vice of the coproduction- its diselementedness- into a virtue. The Comfort of Strangers is a masterpiece about not belonging. Indeed, for much of its opening hour it's a masterpiece about getting lost. English 53</page><page sequence="3">Christopher Walken, Rupert Everett. Helen Mirren, Natasha Richardson. lovers Natasha Richardson and Rupert Everett prowl the dim-lit Venice alleys, where mazy corners return them to starting-point and mirror-sleek canals duplicate their bewilderment. Sundered from children and employers back in England (her children, his publisher), the willowy young writer and the quizzi- cal young woman are trying to piece together a love life. But they re in a city where they can hardly piece together their own geography. "My friends A white suit containing Christopher Walken hoves out of the darkness. Its after midnight in some God-forsaken alley and the couple hasn't eaten. Would you refuse the kindness of a tall, polite stranger who knows a late-night bar still serving food? Except that it isn't. The foods run out. There's only wine and Walken's long, weird, faintly offensive mono- logues. About his strict father; about how his naughty sisters tied the boy up one day, full of cake and lemonade, and shut him up in Dads precious study; about the incontinent chaos that resulted; about Dad's fury; about his sisters' glee; about how Walken later married. . . . "What a terrible man," says Richard- son hours later, as they stagger out into the dark. They'll not run into him again, surely. But this is movie Venice: they will. They are invited to his apparta- mento- which resembles a cross between a Venetian palace and an Ori- ental mosque seen through an opium dream. They meet his wife Helen Mir- ren, who complains of a bad back and whispers to them, "Please come back, I cant get out." Back at their hotel, they find their own sex life mysteriously recharged. They make love for days on end. They trade fantasies. Life is high and strange. They can leave Venice happy and renewed and unscathed. They head across town. They don't need to meet the terrible Walken and his wife again. They see the future and it is going to work. "My friends There is no escaping the velvet claw of Venice, once the lion wakes, stretches itself, and sights you. There is blood before bedtime in this movie- but you probably guessed that already. You cer- tainly intuit it pretty early if you see the film: from the bleeding backdrop sun- sets, from the air of mildewed menace in Walken's never-bettered performance. Walken looks like Peter Finch after a bout of anorexia nervosa, and he speaks in a slow, flaky baritone- singsong and barely accented- as if intoning a litany rather than conducting a conversation. But then that's one of the' movie's points. It's about behavior as ritual, social intercourse as liturgy, passion- or psychosis- as ceremony. It's about the Old World (Venice-Italy-Europe) ten- dering its merciless, crafted affections to the New. Though Richardson and Ever- ett are English, they could as easily be American innocents abroad: two of Henry James' wet-eared adventurers learning first lessons in life from the dec- adent Europeans. Not for the first time - but never more effectively- Schräder builds his movie round a hero/heroine who courts self-knowledge through self-endanger- ment or self-destruction. Half-willing themselves into terror, the couple in The Comfort of Strangers joins a gallery that also includes Travis Bickle, Mishima, Patty Hearst, and even the humanized, harrowed Jesus of The Last Temptation of Christ. Wandering into Schräder territory, Ian McEwan's novel sets its characters adrift on a sea of threatening uncer- tainty. The novel quotes Cesare Pavese as a foretext: "Travelling is a brutality. It forces you to trust strangers and to lose sight of all that familiar comfort of home and friends. You are constantly off bal- ance. Nothing is yours except the essen- tial things- air, sleep, dreams, the sea, the sky- all things tending towards the 54</page><page sequence="4">eternal or what we imagine of it." The purification of personality by stripping away 'comfort" is the essence of tragedy. Its also the essence of Schra- der's own moral dramas of discomfiture, from Blue Collar to Patty Hearst. And it accounts for the humanists- or lapsed Calvinisti - interest in the story of Christ. As a tale, The Comfort of Stran- gers proceeds by startlingly New Testa- ment steps. It begins with goodness born into a foreign land; it presents the recognition of evil as a baptism into the world; it moves on to persecution, fore- boding, the treachery of "friends," and a climactic blood sacrifice. No of city being could "constantly better host off the balance" sense of being "constantly off balance" than Venice. In movies even more than in literature, the terra infirma of a city built on water is a favored setting for sto- ries of intrigue, mystery, or crime. (Amsterdam, Miami, Bangkok.) Venices temptress visual deceptions help Schrä- der turn up the movies suspense to an almost unbearable degree. Identifying with the bemused and vulnerable visi- tors-we all feel like that abroad - we recognize the seedy lure of the city and the seedier lure of the stranger who offers comfort. Hes the man on the next airplane seat who buttonholes you when the meal tray comes, the guy who strikes up uninvited chat in a foreign res- taurant. The friendlier he is, the more apprehensive we feel. The Devil can be such a charmer. (How friendly Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie were to James Stewart and Doris Day in Morocco. Che sarà sarà.) Schräder coaxes us towards terror, aided by Venices shadowplay and watery mirror tricks, and by Walken s putrefac- tious charm. Also by photography and music that have a sickly, languorous beauty. The first gives us dusty-auburn color and sudden, disorienting crane shots, rearing up to hypnotize us like a snake. The second turns its gloomy, mellifluous surgings into half-perceived variations on "There may be trouble ahead." (Clearly the tune of the season; Batman also played around with it.) Instability is the films theme and keynote. And in Venice the metaphor for instability goes deeper even than the streets made of water. Built on centu- ries-old wooden piles, the city sits on strata of decaying history as if Venice were a rotting emblem for European cul- ture itself.

The theme is built into the very rhythms of Pinter s screenplay. A long filial memory-monologue by Walken ("My father was a big man . . .") is repeated several times, like a litany. Once, voice-off in an opening camera prowl through the lush palazzo. Later as he regales Everett and Richardson in the bar. Finally, as an explanation of his behavior to the surreal Italian police ("We dont get it," bleats the inspector, wrapping B-movie locutions in a Po Val- ley accent). Of course the speech explains noth- ing. Or rather, it appears not to. It seems as ritualized and decrepit as the layers of compacted history Venice and Europe are built on. It suggests that the Euro- pean mindset believes that merely to trawl back through the past, counting off ghosts, will "explain" everything. When Everett asks Walken why he has been covertly snapping photographs of him, Walken answers by pointing first to a barbershop they are passing, then to Venice's Cemetery Island: places of repair and repose for his grandfather and father. History, suggests the scene, is simply about dead people. And dead responses. There seems to be no con- nection at all between Everett's question and Walkens reply. But of course there is. History is more than the sum total of the dead and buried. If we dig deep enough, these non-sequituf invocations of the past start to explain everything. Walkens pur- suit and eventual murder of Everett becomes his revenge against his fathers cosmetic manliness ("Mascara") and against the homosexual traces written on his own personality. And the sado- masochistic relationship between Walken and Mirren - wow, what a movie! -is on one level a reprise of, and reprisal against, the tormenting practical joke once visited on him by his sisters. On a deeper level, its a rehearsal for death by a couple who in mortality- enamored Venice see Thanatos and Eros as a two-backed beast. So history can explain, it can give life and meaning to the unknowable. The decaying strata of Venice become sym- bolic with the psychic striations of the characters minds. And as if vampirically, the Old World becomes more alive dur- ing the movie while the New World becomes more drained and cadaverous. Schräder finds a perfect imagistic lan- guage for this. Venice's trompe-1'oeil restlessness as a city turns it into a play- ground for ghostly deceits and mocking anthropomorphism. Empty gondolas curtsey in the midnight waters; floor- length paintings prove to be doors; Venetian alleys echo each other like the cries of the lost. Conversely, the "mod- ern" is cold, stiff, frightening. Lost down yet another alley, Everett and Richard- son happen on a shop window display- ing, in eerie blue light, a pair of mannequins sprawled in a double bed. It's at once a parody of their own ailing relationship and the image of a world banished to a zone of terminal sterility. "Looks like a space shuttle" is Everett's only comment. (Indeed, as inert images combine to create an eerie polyphony of movement and meaning, The Comfort of Strangers seems as close to Antonioni as to Losey-Pinter.) American long heyday popular as the cinema darling has of had mod- a long heyday as the darling of mod- ern film criticism: from the idolizing by the Cahiers crowd of "le cinema Hitchcocko-Hawksien" to the Holly- woodophilia of later European filmma- kers like Wenders, Fassbinder, and Bertolucci. But European cinema is now poised to fanfare its own values again, especially at the outset of an age likely to be riddled with hands-across-the- Atlantic movie projects. Those values lie in a conviction that a movie's poetic subtext is as important as its narrative clarity, and that the audience should be encouraged to make its own deductions and connections about a story's meaning rather than have it spoonfed to them. Ambiguity and complexity are worth championing, even in a generation when movie criticism has gone chronically populist. For too long now, critics have been trotting out the phrase "classical narrative cinema" at the drop of a Boetti- cher Western, a Sam Fuller thriller, or a piece of junk, ancient or modern, by Raoul Walsh or John Carpenter. Classi- cal narrative cinema should get back in line. Classical poetic cinema- the other side of the mirror- would like another bite at the world movie audience. The wonder of The Comfort of Stran- gers is that it gives us the best of both in one film. It's a meeting between Ameri- can and European minds that suggests hope is at hand. It proves you can tell a good story and still keep audiences searching keenly for the untold story. You can engage an audiences emotions and its mind at the same time. You can unfold the visible splendors of a beauti- ful city and still excite your audience into digging down into the cankered piles and lost striations for the true, sunken poetry. $ 56</page></plain_text>
