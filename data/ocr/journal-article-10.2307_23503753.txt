<plain_text><page sequence="1">INVITATION TO INTOLERANCE A study of the Portuguese sermons preached at autos-da-fé EDWARD GLASER, Harvard University T י I "*HE primary aim of the sermons addressed to convicted Judaizers -*- at autos-da-fé was to refute once and for all their grave errors.1 Accordingly, the fathers went to great length to explain, for the fright ened victims, theological problems which, because of their intricacy, remained beyond their grasp. Though the priests considered a clear exposition of Truth their main task, they did not limit themselves to dealing with doctrinal differences. Rather, they felt justified in pre senting a sweeping indictment of the "poison weed of Judaism." They extolled the labors of the ministers of the Inquisition, toiling restlessly to stem the tide of heresy, and they gave alarm to the dangers their be loved Portugal risked by tolerating within her boundaries the Crypto Jews. As a result of this approach the inquisitorial sermons constitute a bitter and often brutal attack against Lusitanian Jewry on several fronts: religious, social, racial and national. Their vehemence is such that it is difficult for one to take seriously the professed aim of bringing back these estranged brethren to the fold of the Church. The purpose of this article is to outline the conception of the Jew developed in these sermons, an image which, backed by the ecclesiastic prestige of the speakers, dominated for centuries the thinking of the Lusitanian man.

It offered a unique opportunity for showing that years of close study had not been spent in vain. In disputing against the archenemy of the Church, the orator could display his vast learning to convince everybody — (with the possible exception of the Marranos) — of the utter absurdity of Jewish errors. Traditionally the speaker was expected to overwhelm the accused with an impressive mass of quotes.3 This intellectual shock therapy shortly becomes tedious and the sermons tax rather heavily the patience of the modern reader. It has been remarked that in nineteen centuries not much has been added to the argumentation of religious controversies between Christians and Jews; an analysis of the sermons will bear out this assertion. A refutation of the Old Law presupposes that the difference be tween the two creeds be clearly established. Repeating an error pre viously made by the convert Geronimo de Santa Fé, a majority of our authors insist upon narrowing down these divergencies to essentially one problem: the Jews' refusal to recognize Christ as their Messiah. This belief is ably expressed by Philipe Moreira: "We disagree only on one point: He has come or He has not come, and this is the basis of all our controversies."4 Since the acceptance of the Messianic claims able to consult the following studies on Jewish-Christian relationships: Hans Joachim Schoeps, Jiidisch-Christtiches Religionsgesprdch in 19 Jahrhunderten (Berlin, 1937); Francisca Vendrell, "La obra de polémica antijudaica de Fray Bernardo Oliver," Sefarad,Sefarad, V (1945), 303-336; Bernhard Blumenkranz, Die Judenpredigt Augustins.

The remonstrance against Jewish obstinacy starts with the fun dament of all their errors: their excessive and unjustified esperanza ("hope" and "waiting" for the Messiah).5 They must be shown that they are waiting for something which already has taken place, for an impossibility, since Christ, the Messiah, is known to have come more than sixteen hundred years ago.6 Their presumed virtues of patience and constancy are unlikely to be rewarded, since they are patently motivated only by ignorance and obduracy.7 In attempting to prove that Christ is actually the Messiah promised to the Jews, the priests, leaning heavily upon patristic apologetics, deal in detail with several time-honored topics: the préfigurations of Jesus; Messianic prophecies; the miracles of the Savior and the as tounding triumph of his doctrine. Since this is the least original part of the sermons, a summary discussion will be sufficient. 5 Jewish esperança is scored by Manoel da Veiga, Lavra de Anfriso (Evora, 1627), fol. 131r: "Tu sô es infiel / Que o naô conheces, improbo Israel. / Canalha infâme que ha taô longos dias / Espéras cega, &amp; triste outro Messias . .."

Since the Jews were known to put faith only in the Old Testament, they had to be convinced that it was but a préfiguration of the Gospel.8 In support of this interpre tation the orators cite a large number of figurae. Symbols for Christ, to name but a few, are: Abel murdered by Cain;9 the ram sacrificed by Abraham;10 Jacob resting his head on a stone;11 the patriarch marrying two women;12 his blessing Ephraim with crossed arms;13 Joseph betrayed by his brothers;14 Moses upholding the serpent of metal15 or breaking the tables of the Law.16 The typological exegesis, as usual, does not follow rigid rules, and the same Biblical personage can, under different circumstances, acquire a new meaning. The most versatile is Jacob, not only an adumbratio of Christ, but also, in his blindness17 or when fighting with the angel,18 a symbol of Judaism. In a similar fashion the authors go to great pains to put across the Christological meaning of well-known passages from the prophets which the Jews have misinterpreted so far.19 Invariably expounded 8 Antonio das Chagas, Sermâo . . .

By no means the least remarkable of these prodigies is that he and his disciples, a group of illiterate fishermen, were able to triumph over the greatest philosophers of their time, and to impose upon mankind — without force of arms24 — a Law that makes no concessions to human appetites.23 The great many miracles, wrought throughout the centuries, in confirmation of Christ's doctrine are considered a bold challenge to Jewish incredulity since Jewry can boast of no unnatural events authorizing their credence.26 Ceuppens, O.P., De Prophetiis messianicis in Antiquo Testamento (Rome, 1935), and Rafael Criado, S.J., La Sagrada Pasiôn en los Profetas (Madrid, 1945). 20 Manoel da Encarnaçam, fol. 2V, and Valerio de Sâo Raymundo, Sermâo . . .

So undeniable is Jesus' Messianic mission that metaphorical attestations thereof are to be found even in the Talmud.27 A good example is an often-quoted story, allegedly taken from this work, about a Jew who was told by an Arab to stop ploughing his fields because his Messiah had been born. Asked for more particulars by the Jewish farmer, the Arab declared that the redeemer had been born in Bethlehem and that his name was the "Consolator."28 Divine Providence also strove to dissuade the Jews from their Messianic hopes. According to their beliefs, the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem as the son of a Jewess. Triumphantly our orators point up that Palestine is practically the only country where the presence of Israelites is not tolerated: "... only in Jerusalem you have neither a shelter nor power or possessions, although the mas ters of that city are the Turks, a people easily swayed by gifts and money."29 Their exclusion from the Holy Land is not lacking in mystery; it is one of the devices God has chosen to manifest to them that there is no longer any foundation for their expectations.30 Convincing as these testimonies may be, the obstinate Jews — iron ically, the etymology of their name means "he who confesses"31 — cling " " Manoel dos Anjos, Sermâo . . . (Evora, 1629), foil. 4v-5r, refers to the following story, allegedly taken from the Jerusalem Talmud. A Jew, named Jacob, cured a sick coreligionist by placing on his head a piece of paper with the name of Jesus inscribed on it. When the patient learned how he had been healed, he exclaimed that he . . antes quizera morrer mil mortes, que sarar por vertude desse nome de Iesu . . ."

Il faut pour nous le prouver qu'ils nous fassent voir comment ils sont rassemblés dans la terre saint que leurs peres avoient possédée.

Abandoning the terrain of theology, the priests next play upon the racial pride of the Marranos, emphasizing that God by incarnating as a Hebrew made the Israelites the most venerable of all nations.32 They underline that the Messiah whom the Jews are asked to trust is one of their own race, a "close relative";33 in addition, ". . . the cream and flower of the Church . . ." are also of Jewish origin.34 Such sound proofs fall on deaf ears and the priests, therefore, attempt to do away with the objections which the Jews have in accepting the Messianism of the Church. Doctrinal scruples account only to a small degree for their obduracy. True enough, they have been led to believe by their spiritual guides that the Messiah will be merely a human being — rather than God and man at the same time — and that he will redeem solely Israel (instead of all mankind), but of greater transcendence is the fact that the Messianic con cept of the Jews is a mirror of their idiosyncracies, and few know them better —or so they believe—■than our fathers. Illustrative of their attitude toward Jewry is a simile by Father Francisco de Mendonça: Place in the one hand of a child a diamond worth 30,000 cruzados',cruzados', place in the other a three-penny apple. Let the child choose. It will regard the diamond and toss it away as if it were worthless. It will look at the apple and it will surely want to keep it. Here you have an example of Israel. Silver, gold, earthly possessions — that is to say a child's treasures —- are venerated and enshrined in their soul. But Divine Grace, heavenly glory, God Himself, their true Messiah, their Redeemer Jesus Christ, all these, true and solid possessions, beneath their feet, utterly despised.35 A people so engrossed in material pursuits is unlikely to heed Him who teaches that worldly possessions must be scorned. Conversely, they will never tire of waiting for a Savior conceived as a dispenser of wealth and honor. "... this error arises"— writes Antonio Coutinho — "from their being so coarse, materialistic and given over to earthly things that they no longer pine for Heaven and eternal blessings, and they cling so much to the flesh that they are no longer concerned (1691), p. 30 and Diogo da Annunciaçam Justiniano, Sermam . . .

Since Jesus was poor, for contradiction's sake the Jewish savior had to to be a powerful, wealthy man, surrounded by a fabulous entourage, ready to subdue by force all those who held the Jews in captivity. "But listen to the qualities of the Messiah whom they are expecting . . . Surrounded with great pomp and secular splendor . . . With a larger following and more women than Solomon had . . . Very powerful in arms and mighty in warfare so that He will be able to free them from the servitude they are enduring . . . Let the kings beware of such vassals as the Jews are, for they hope that their Messiah will destroy all the monarchs in whose lands they live . . ."3' It is especially the secular powers associated with this Messianic ideal which give rise to the indignation of our authors. They feel that on the basis of such a criterion Alexander, Caesar or Nero should be classified as redeemers.40 Our priests are cognizant of the fact that in the Talmud there are Messianic legends which contrast sharply with the ideal they have commented on as representing Jewish beliefs. Reversing completely their position, the fathers pretend that only a strict, textual inter pretation would be suitable for these tales. Their approach is motivated by the desire to ridicule Judaism by all possible means. The amaze ment of the Catholic audience at the ultimate goal of Jewish expecta tions must have given way to laughter when they learned that, 36 Op. cit.\ fol. 5r. Gil Vicente, Diâlogo sobre a Resurreiçào (in Obras, J. V. Barreto Feio e J. G. Monteiro eds. [Lisboa, 1843], I, 352) also derides the worldly character of the Jews' Messianic ideal: "Porque essas farturas que a terra antremette, / Forâo creadas pera os animaes, / E que o Deu poderoso essas cousas taes / Nâo nas estima, nem dâ, nem promette; / E que o Mexias, / Se bem entendermos nossas profecias, / Nâo vinha a fartar os corpos de mel." 37 Op. cit.', p. 12. 38 Sermam . . .

There are, as we have seen, many flaws in the Messianism of the Jews. None is more incensing than the assertion that the arrival of the Messiah has been delayed because a great many Hebrews have accepted conversion. "Surely you have a most sensitive Messiah" — Joâo de Ceita retorts —; "simply because a few Jews became sincere Christians, He has as yet not shown Himself. On the other hand, the vast majority who have rejected Christ could not induce Him to come."45 The flimsiness of this argument is its best refutation. 41 Accursio de Sâo Pedro, Sermam . . .

(Villa-Franca, 1729 [?]), p. 68 stresses that a nation which embraced so enthusias tically the Messianic cult of the lost king Dom Sebastiâo should show more under standing for the Jews' willingness to accept a few pseudo-Messiahs: "Por ventura no huvo, y hay en Portugal hasta el dia de oy, quien espera al Rey Don Sebastian? no uvo en los passados siglos, uno que fingiô serlo? y no se escrivieron Libros en su abono? Pues si esto sucede en una Nacion libre, solo por la ancia de rever un Rey que estimava: que mucho padeciese semejante engano, una Nacion oprimida; con la Esperança de ver un Rey que Dios le tiene prometido?"

MARIOLOGY AND TRINITARIANISM The understanding of divine truth is too serious a matter for more than infrequent jests about Jewish gullibility, for the speakers realize that fanciful tales alone do not account for the obstinacy of the ac cused. One of the great difficulties for the Judaizers is the mystery of the Virgin Birth of Christ. They refuse to believe that Mary con ceived . . without the knowledge of man . . .," remaining a Virgin after the birth of Jesus, a miracle clearly forecast by the prophets.6'' Following the Letter of Rabbi Samuel, the priests point out the perti nent passages in Isaiah [7.14 "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel"] and in Jeremiah [31.22 "For the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man"].47 The doubt of the Jews is all the harder to under stand since they readily believe that the bottom of the Red Sea remained covered with flowers after they had crossed it; nevertheless, they deny that "... the Son of God . . . could pass from the womb of a Mother to this world without withering the beautiful flowers and virginal roses of his Divine Mother."48 As a last — and perhaps more effective — recourse, another appeal is made to the national pride of the accused: Mary, being a Jewess, should command their veneration.49 Although repeatedly the claim is advanced that the only significant difference between Judaism and Catholicism is whether or not the Messiah has come, there is ample evidence that the preachers were cognizant of the much broader range of divergencies between the two 46 Antonio das Chagas, pp. 19-20.

The priests point out that a Messiah, who is conceived as God and man is unacceptable to their Neo-Christian listeners who, in their malice or ignorance, pretend that to believe in God the Father and God the Son (the Messiah) implies renouncing monotheism. The Mes siahship of Jesus cannot be explained without taking up as well the more intricate problem of the Trinity. No longer can one rely ex clusively upon reason : faith has to provide a key to this mystery. This does not mean, however, that Scriptural testimonies for Trinitarianism are lacking. Typological exegesis again comes up with a remarkable number of préfigurations such as the three men appearing to Abraham, the wood, the fire and the sword with which Isaac was to to be sacrificed, or the three stones upon which Jacob rested his head.50 Revelations of the Holy Trinity are also found in Exodus [34.6 "And the Lord . . . proclaimed, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious . . ."] and in Isaiah [6.3 "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts . . ."].5I Even grammatical subtleties are pressed into the service of proselytism. The use of the "plural" Elohim together with the verb barabara in the singular demonstrates that Divine wisdom employs the most hidden devices to reveal that God is one and trine.52 Credit for all this erudition can rightly be claimed by Galatin who pro vided our fathers with doctrinal ammunition against his former co-religionists.53 Jewish pertinacity in denying the Trinity reflects the attitude of a people who fail to realize that the ineffable mysteries of Divine nature go beyond the limitations of human intelligence.54 Some Marranos, 5° Manoel Pereyra, Sermam . . .

God's attitude toward idolaters is well known; the favors which He so freely bestows on the Catholics while at the same time increasing the punishment of the Jews are the best vindication of Catholicism. 3. APOLOGY OF THE NEW LAW, ECCLESIOLOGY The Jews should be the very last people to lay idolatry to others since this abominable vice so often disgraced their nation in pre-Christian times. By a strange paradox the worship of idols ceased among the Jews after the crucifixion of Christ and from then on they adhered scrupulously to Mosaic Law.57 Nothing, however, could be more erro neous than the assumption that they had purged themselves of their former weakness. Idolatry remained with them, but in a guise: the stubborn adherence to their now invalid creed. Contrary to Jewish belief, the Old Law was not meant to be perennial and was abrogated 5s Barata, p. 64. Cf. Vicente da Costa Mattos' anecdote (Breve discvrso contra a a heretica perfidia do ivdaismo . . . [Lisboa, 1622], fol. 60v) : ". . . hum christâo nouo dos que vendem panos de linho, vendo que outro seu companheiro enfermara de sorte, q era necessario contemporisar com os vizinhos, (que visitandoo podiâo notar nâo auer image algua naquella casa) buscou hua da Virgem nossa Senhora, que lhe pos defronte da cama, a qual vendo o tal doente, gritaua dizendo que lhe tirassem daly aquillo, que lhe fazia dôr de cabeça, que as imagens aborrecem elles principal mente . . ." Menasseh ben Israel, Vindiciae Judaeorum . . .

Ambrosio de Jesu writes: "I hold that Judaism is today like the Dead Sea of Judea. No life is created in it. In this Dead Sea of the Jews which we see here, everything today is dead. They have only a few ceremonies left, all false and meaningless. Although they appear to be fruitful, they are completely sterile . . ."6° Moses, their venerable legislator, is seen as a speaker who, after having delivered a graceful and polished discourse, gives up his chair to the next orator.61 Christ, who occupied the rostrum after him, so perfected his doctrine that the Law of Grace is in every respect superior to the Old Law, which may only be considered its shadow.62 The demands which the New Testament makes upon the faithful attest to its greatness: the Catholic is required to believe in mysteries which human reason strives to understand in vain; he is compelled to observe a form of conduct which clashes with his own inclinations. Correspondingly great are the guerdons it proffers, since temporary rewards are replaced by spiritual ones.63 A contrast similar to that between the Old Law (Ley cansada) and the Law of Grace is also to be observed in the antagonism between the Church and the Synagogue. Francisco Vieyra brings this opposi tion into focus by a string of antithetical allegories: "The Synagogue is a confused labyrinth which, having roads leading to perdition, does not offer you a single door to salvation. It is a bramble of pricking thorns. It is a sea of ferocious lions. It is an Egypt of tears and tor ments. It is a confused Babel. It is a cemetery of bones. It is a pur gatory for living people.

Judaism, like a wife unworthy of trust, remained locked up in Palestine.65 Catholicism, on the contrary, could not be walled in and continues to triumph in every part of the earth. The successful propagation of Catholicism stands out the more vividly in view of the outright rejection of Mosaic Law by all the nations except the Israelites.66 4. COMMON SENSE REASONS: THE REJECTION OF ISRAEL AND THE DIASPORA Our authors like to imagine that the Jews, unable to counter the motives motives da fé (the previously explained theological arguments), far from accepting the truth revealed to them, steadfastly hide behind their ignorance. Their rabbis, the Jews assert, could find the proper rebuttals which they in their simplicity cannot adduce. Such a subter fuge is of no avail as far as the last great argument in the century-old dispute between Christianity and Judaism is concerned. Scholarship is not required to grasp the veracity of this statement; daily experience argues this point more convincingly than the Doctors of the Church. Before God sent Christ, His Messiah, the relationship between God and the Jews was such that one could properly speak of Israel as His first-born people.67 The Hebrews belonged to the House of God, ". . . they had Him within their walls ... He lived among them."68 64 Viegas, pp. 19-20. The Spanish dramatist Juan Pérez de Montalbân (1602 1658) wrote an auto sacramental, El Polifemo, which deals with the dispute between the Church and the Synagogue. See H.

The Jews must have committed a crime of such gravity that Divine Justice could show neither pity nor forgive ness: the heinous offense which brought about a complete reversal in the history of Jewry was deicide. This is the cornerstone of the indict ment of Judaism and the Jews. In every single sermon fullest attention is given to Jewish responsibility for the murder of Christ. The aim of this emphasis is twofold: to arouse the religious fervor of the Christian audience and to impress upon the accused the enormity of their crime. A thorough description of Jewish atrocities is instru mental in driving this point home. A good example is Bernardo de Castelbranco's treatment of the passion of Jesus, "... whom your forefathers arrested, whipped, slapped, insulted, mocked, wounded, hurt and nailed to a Cross between wicked thieves. Finally, after harassing him to death, they shamefully murdered him."71 The priests feel eminently justified in implicating the Marranos in this nefarious murder, because, as Saint Augustine wrote, to deny Christ is tanta mount to crucifying him once more.72 The task of meting out their just deserts to the culprits was not 69 Moreira (1646), p. 13, and Viegas, pp. 6-7. י° Mendonça (1619), p. 45. 1י Castelbranco, pp. 27-28.

True enough, the Inquisition has seen to it that the blood of Christ has finally fallen upon the descendants of his victimizers. But only God Himself, by dispersing them over the whole world, could fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah (22.18) that the Israelites would be like a ball tossed into a large country.73 ". . . with out God, Law or King . . ."74 — this phrase best sums up the severity of their plight, a captivity which has lasted for more than sixteen centuries. Like gypsies they are forced from one country to the other,75 since they do not have even a palm of earth they can call their own, a blessing not denied the most barbarous nations.76 For the Jews the world is but a gigantic prison.77 Nowhere will they be granted per manent residence, and even all their money is insufficient to acquire a homestead ; at best, they can hope to secure temporary lodgings from which they will be expelled shortly afterwards.78 The reason for their world-wide dispersal is evident. Just as human justice exhibits in four directions the parts of an executed criminal's body, so had God ex posed the quarters of this nation in the four corners of the earth. And to the inquiry as to why this people has been quartered, the same answer should always be given: because they have murdered their Messiah.79 The sharp and shocking contrast between the Jews' former glory and their present wretched state provides the orators with an excel lent opportunity for the use of a "black and white" technique in which they excel. With rhetorical virtuosity they dwell upon the Hebrews' enviable past so that their present misery will become more clearly measurable.

One's suffering grows by comparison with the joy and glory of lost bliss."81 The trials and tribulations which the Jews have had to endure for the last sixteen hundred years in every country — the via de experien ciacia — should suffice to eradicate even the last vestiges of a belief in the Mosaic Law. But Jewish alienation (desaccordo) — or resource fulness —• has always a retort ready, which the priests quickly explain away. Their captivity, they assert, is not intended as a punishment; rather it is to enable them to teach the nations among which they reside.82 This claim is hardly worthy of serious consideration, since the Jews, unlike the Apostles, do not preach their faith openly. A semblance of truth, however, is not wanting in the contention that God often afflicts those whom He wishes to try so that He may later on heap His blessings upon them. Basing themselves on such incidents narrated in the Bible, some Jews hold that their present calamitous state is to be interpreted as temporal, but not as eternal chastise ment.83 This sophism can stand no further scrutiny. One can scarcely overlook that, while God may test certain individuals, He has never put on trial a nation as a whole. Besides, an examination of the Biblical episodes in question shows that their longest previous captivity lasted for seventy years; never before has reconciliation been put off for such a long time. The withholding of divine favors from the Jews for a period of centuries then confirms that they are being punished as obstinate sinners not as beloved sons.84 5. BLINDNESS AS CAUSE OF HERESY Divine retribution for the death of Christ, Francisco de Santo Thomas asserts, not only changed the temporal state of the Jews, it also brought about severe spiritual punishments. The most serious of these is Jewish blindness (cegueyra) which prevents them from understanding the true cause of their misfortunes.85 A préfiguration of their benight 81 Op. cit. (1642), fol.

Many of the authors are under no illusions as to the ultimate outcome of their evangelical exertions. Quite often we are told right at the begin ning of the sermons that an attempt to convert the Jews is not only an ungrateful task, but also one bordering on the impossible. An ac cumulation of images of frustration serves to bring into focus the futility of their endeavor. Francisco da Costa writes: "I fear, my lord, that to preach your Faith to these people will be like crying aloud in the wilderness; like writing in water without leaving a trace; like sowing in sand with no hope of harvest; like hammering an anvil to no avail: in short, it is as if one attempted with a human voice and a human arm to break through a diamond, wearing oneself out with but scant success, if any."8' Ioanne Mendes de Tavora, addressing the Inquisitors in particular, questions whether one should not dispense altogether with the sermons so that Jewish stubbornness would not impair the prestige of the doctrine preached to them : "It is the doctrine of Galen that when a patient comes to a state where the physician despairs for his life, he ought not to administer the remedies which restored health to other sick people lest their reputation suffer. This disease [i.e. Judaism] Gentlemen, is mortal. It has lasted for more than sixteen hundred years.

For our priests there is no doubt that only Christ himself can overcome Jewish obduracy and to him they turn in a dramatic gesture, imploring his indispensable assistance. Jesus is asked to turn his cross into a pulpit as a last recourse for saving those whom God once had called His sons: "Preach to them, Incarnate Wisdom, preach to them from the pulpit of your Cross, because only such a sermon will bear fruit in these your sons . . ."93 II. On Jewish and Marrano Religion It should be firmly established by now that neither "authorities" (testimonies from the Scriptures) nor "experience" (the sufferings of Israel) can induce the Jews to renounce the religion of their fathers. The excellence of a creed for which year after year so many inquisi torial victims sacrifice life, honor, and wealth deserves extended com ment, and the fathers do not turn from the task of enlightening both the Catholic audience and the accused on the salient features of Judaism. The data presented — either outright falsifications or ma terial arbitrarily separated from its context — illustrate the extra vagance of the Jewish faith.

"I have found" — Bento de Santo Thomas writes — "that to set a blind man on his right road the first thing called for is to remove any obstacles from his path; and, accordingly, my main purpose is to make you see the falseness of your masters. Far from being your staff, they make you stumble, and, moreover, their doctrine is the snare which brings you down."95 As for the Catholics, an exact knowledge of what this unfortunate people is compelled to believe as articles of faith should strengthen their filial affection for the Church.96 I.I. THE TALMUD Since the Old Testament is held in the highest esteem by both Jews and Christians, the source of all Jewish aberrations must be sought elsewhere. The Jews have no work comparable to the Gospel, and, consequently, one must turn to the writings of their "Doctors." For tunately, these have been compiled in a book known as the Talmud,97 a work on which our authors comment at length, though their knowl edge of its content is limited. The priests' preference for the Talmud can be explained by the many opportunities it offers for ridicule. No where else does Jewish ignorance seem to reveal itself more strikingly than in its teachings. Extremely vague is the information which the fathers give on the origin, date of composition and nature of this work; "... a volume thicker than ten of our Bibles . . ."98 The assertion that it constitutes a belated redaction of the Law orally transmitted by God to Moses is dismissed as a fable of the rabbis. The truth, according to Christovam de Santa Maria, is that, four hundred years after Christ, a mass con version of Jews, convinced by Scriptural testimonies, began to take place.

It is true that not all the priests are sufficiently familiar with the work to have a clear idea of the distinction between the Palestinian and the Babylonian Talmud, but they all know that it is not the work of a single author.100 On the whole, their remarks on the composition of the Talmud are ambiguous. Because of their devastating sarcasm Mendes de Tavora's comments deserve to be singled out: "This is the Talmud. Every day a few leaves were sown to the growing volume, as everybody scrib bled on his few words."101 Our preachers entertain no doubts as to the validity of the Tal mud's doctrine, which is held to mirror the moral stature of its rab binical authors. The "Talmudic wolves" — to borrow a term from Joâo de Barros102 — are, like their disciples, ignorant, blind and bent on deceit. To further their aims they do not hesitate to alter the sacred texts, a task facilitated by the particularities of Hebrew orthography.103 Small wonder then that their Talmud should be a ".". . . tome full of falsehood . . .," an instrument of perdition.104 Its laws authorize the Jews to lie, to swindle, to steal, and even to kill.105 For good measure it is added that homosexuality is condoned;106 this allegation is particularly grave for a society which inevitably chas tised sexual deviation with the death penalty. No sufficiently severe invectives can be found for a code that sanctions such crimes. Father Francisco Vieyra believes that the only suitable designation for the Talmud is to call it the Jewish Koran, that is to say the embodiment of heretical perfidy.107 95 Christovam de Santa Maria, Sermao . . .

This charge is backed up by allusions to the anthropomorphic images of the Talmud, a pet topic of our speakers and the source of many humorous asides.109 For the priests it is the height of both folly and sacrilege to imagine that God has a rigid schedule for His daily activities and references in the Talmud to His labors are glossed at length.110 The tale which portrays God as spending the first three hours of every day with the study of the Law stirs Father José do Espirito Santo to write: "To deny God's wisdom they say that God studies . . . from their Talmud, and thereby they depict God as having such a poor memory that He must continue to study, although He daily pores over this book. They make of Him a disciple of their masters; they make us fellow students of God who are in the same class and study in the same primer. Can anybody conceive of a more insolent foolishness?"111 That the Lord, before creating the earth, should have "practiced" intensively by making and destroying several other worlds, evokes, as far as Couto is concerned, the image of a child playing in the sand rather than divine omnipotence.112 Grotesque is for them also the concept of a God who, unable to free His chosen people from captivity, dishevels His hair and beard, whenever the Jews praise Him in their synagogues. Accursio de Sâo Pedro wryly adds: "Do you think, Jews, that you worship a good God? A God with His hair and beard plucked off because of His anguish and grief. . . Abjure such a God. Probably, He has no longer any more hair to pull out, if you continue to frequent the Synagogue. Has anyone heard anywhere in the world, even among the most barbarous nations, such nonsense?""3 Particularly strong objections are voiced to anything which might be construed as a restriction of God's unlimited power, and this attitude accounts for 108 Ceita, fol. 15r. 109 Valerio de Sâo Raymundo, p. 20. 110 Manoel dos Anjos (1629), fol. 13L and Christovam de Almeida, pp. 46-47.

God promised this learned man, when asked to remedy his financial plight, to create a new world so that the rabbi could be born under a different star. One might then conclude that "... God, in order to make a man rich, has need of the influence of Heaven and celestial constellations.""4 For the priests this smacks of paganism, since it is not expressly stated that the "stars" are but metaphors of divine providence. Such a presentation of the Talmudic concept of God leaves little room for further surprise; otherwise they would have been stunned by Jewish ideas about eternal bliss. The beatitude for which so many Marranos risk their life, they are told, consists merely of a few tiny pieces of salted leviathan: "... the flesh of a serpent, and even that salted"—exclaims Estevam de Sant'Anna—"I call this a glory in brine . . .""s Father José do Espirito Santo also takes advantage of this belief to deploy his satirical vein in a carefully elaborated con trast between the glory promised by the Talmudists and the reality their disciples have to face in Portugal: "Since there are so many of you who have to eat from one fish, everyone will receive but a scant ration. Think now if your glory, and even fresher than you expect it, cannot be bought for a few cents in a tavern. Well, I pledge you my word and assure you, on behalf of God, that if you continue with your Judaism, you are not going to obtain even this bliss of a rotten fish. You will be the fish, because with this bait the devil is catching you for his kitchen. Here you will be scaled of your possessions and life, here you will be pickled and brined; there you will be boiled and fried in eternal fires.""d For the final deprecation of the Talmud only one other datum has to be added. That God should have inspired such an evil book is inconceivable; far more sound, in view of what has been revealed about the work, is the assumption that the devil himself concocted its doctrine. This contention is borne out by the Talmudic story of the demon Benthemalion whose cooperation enabled Rabbi Joseph and Rabbi Simeon to obtain the revocation of a decree by Tiberius, prohibiting the teaching and observance of the Mosaic Law. The demon's assistance could not be dispensed with, yet Rabbi Simeon, unable to hold back the tears, remarked to his companion: "Lo! To Hagar, the slave of our father Abraham, there appeared an angel to console her when she trod desperate and afflicted through the desert. But what we have seen is the devil. Look, my friend, to what 114 Estevam de Sant'Anna, fol. 8r. "5 Op. cit.-, fol. 22v. 116 Ûp. cit.; p. 7.</page><page sequence="24">350 EDWARD GLASER [24] miserable state we have come. Nevertheless, we must go on.

Often selected for special consideration is Rabbi Solomon, who, for our authors, is the archvillain among post Talmudic scholars. The prestige which he enjoyed among the Jews (".(". . . he was for you the Solomon among your Rabbis . . .") accen tuates his responsibility for the eternal condemnation of his disciples and followers (". . . it was he who has carried the largest number of Jews to hell . .

There he replaced the verb form vehichre (vocabitur) by vehichra (vocavit) so that he would not have to confess the Messiahship of Christ.1" That he should have to stoop to such devices, lays bare the unten ableness of the creed which Rabbi Solomon upheld. 2.

Such want of discernment is only surpassed by their modern descendants, the Portuguese Crypto Jews. An array of learned and trustworthy men — princes of the Church, professors of theology and distinguished preachers — who inspire with the shining example of their Christian conduct, are ready and eager to instruct the Neo-Christians in the mysteries of the Faith.124 But it is not to them that the Marranos turn in search for guidance, and this irreverence aggravates their guilt. The Judaizers prefer to heed the admonitions of laymen, especially of members of their own family, although the latter have not the slightest knowledge of divine letters.123 That strong family ties accounted for the survival of traces of Judaism among the neophytes, the preachers fully understood.126 Often they take issue with the spurious argument that the accused, for tradition's sake, had to continue practicing the ceremonies held dear by their parents. For the rebuttal of this belief, the priests rely on stories from the Bible and on "common sense." As an example from the Old Testament, worthy of imitation, they point to Abraham who abandoned paganism, the religion of his fathers, for the Law of God.127 Conversely, if established custom were given precedence over truth, then the worshippers of the Golden Calf would have been entirely justified in clinging to their idolatry.128 Of course, filial affection and obedience, they maintained, was not to be extended to matters per taining to the soul, for there is no connection whatever between XXII (1931)' I-33' and "Immanuel Aboab's Proselytization of the Marranos," The The Jewish Quarterly Review, XXIII (1932), 121-162.

It stands to reason that no one would plug his ears because his father was deaf, nor would anybody keep his eyes always shut because his father happened to be blind.129 Similarly, nobody should say: "... my father died as a Jew, I wish to die as a Jew like him . . .," since that is another way of affirming: ". . . my father went to hell, I wish to go to hell with him."130 Men, if we were to believe the speakers, did not excel as pro selytizers among the Marranos. The successful propagation of Judaism, inquisitorial vigilance notwithstanding, is laid primarily to skillful indoctrination by mothers and grandmothers. As priests and as men, the orators resent the trust placed in such authorities against whom they launch many barbs.131 Typical is a passage in Ferreyra's sermon where he derides the ". . . few women, nearly a hundred years old, who, because of their decrepitude, can, perhaps, no longer sew or spin. (These are the only arts they have studied and which they ought to teach you). As such they teach you unworthy things and cere monies so ridiculous as to provoke laughter did they not arouse our compassion. . . ."132 The preachers, to vilify further the Judaizers, stress that masters and disciples alike are engaged in mechanical arts (officios mecânicos) and therefore are incapable of handling doctrinal questions.133 This view shows the well-known prejudice of Iberian society against those who work at menial tasks, strengthened here by the disdain of the cleric for the layman. Since a similarly warped judgment shades their thinking with regard to small merchants,134 it follows that anybody who accepts a creed expounded by a shoemaker from Leria or a spice dealer from Castelbranco,135 is wilfully avoiding the path of truth. 12י Alvares, p. 14. 1"נ Manoel Fagundes, Sermam ...

The Crypto-Jews' notions of the Mosaic Law are so scanty that even if that faith still retained its validity, they would, as the priests confidently assert, forfeit sal vation by their very practices.136 Their treacherous masters withheld from them the fact that Jewish ceremonies were meaningful only in Palestine, and that after the destruction of the Temple by Titus, the observances formerly prescribed had become an affront to God's will.137 This is the core of the problem, and the orators set store by this argument. They often point to "sacrifices" offered outside of Jerusalem as evidence of Jewish simplicity. Domingos Barata tells of a dispute with a rabbi residing in Holland whom he tried to convince that the celebration of Mosaic rites in the Low Lands countered God's prohibition. The rabbi resolved this "dilemma" by denying that such an interdiction appeared anywhere in the Scriptures.138 The main target of our priests, however, is not the superficial knowledge which the accused have of Judaism, though it is certainly amusing that they should know only four or five out of a total of 613 precepts.139 Above all, the speakers intend to demonstrate how childish, foolish and unworthy of a religion all their observances are.140 Once more the fathers brandish ridicule as their most formidable weapon in the assault against a stubborn enemy. Accordingly, no systematic exposition of Jewish rites and celebrations can be expected. The amount of attention they are given depends entirely upon the extent to which they are likely to degrade the titular Christians in the eyes of the population. The most frequently discussed "Jewish" ceremony is termed varrervarrer a casa as auessas ("to sweep the house the wrong way"), and we are told that almost all the accused had confessed to this par ticular offense.141 In the sermons available to me no explanation of 6גי Alvaro da Costa, fol. 7r~v. לני דגי Fernândez Prata, tr., Carta . . p. 6. o8 Op. cit.-, p. 65.

The ingenious polygrapher Dom Fran cisco Manoel de Melo offers a valuable clue in his Apôlogos dialogaes where he alludes in passing to the fact that "... the Jews sweep toward the inside of the house so that they shall not, as they say, throw out their possessions . . ."142 This casual reference in a purely literary work indicates that the ceremony was widely known. Whether the practice originated with the Marranos or found favor with po tential Judaizers because the Inquisition was so mindful of it, I am unable to say. The very lightness of the offense accounts perhaps for its prominent place in the records of the Holy Office, since many an accused may have preferred to admit heterodoxy in his housekeeping methods than undergo prolonged tortures. By exaggerating the significance of this practice beyond all pro portions the fathers enhance its already considerable humorous pos sibilities. With tongue in cheek Rebello states that for the Jews this is ". . . the heart of their salvation . . ."14נ Others solemnly assure the accused that the way one sweeps the house does not concern God at all.144 Father Pedro Correa, bringing into full play his rhetoric, face tiously admonishes those who believe that the rigid observance of this rite can be the road to wealth: "What wealth can come into a house because one sweeps in the reverse direction? Only the inverse of wealth — straw, dust and filth."145 Equally interesting are the data on ceremonies for the dead, many of which remind the worthy fathers of pagan customs. Pearls were placed in the mouth of the dead who were also provided with money for their last journey.'46 Whenever possible they were not buried in 142 (Lisboa, 1721), p. 273.

We are also told that the Jews, to vent their grief during mourning, placed themselves behind the doors of their houses.147 This is by no means a complete list of superstitions. The patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were honored by casting into the fire . . three rounded balls of flour . . ."148 Flour was also deposited behind the doors,149 and there were precepts even for such trifling matters as to when one ought to pour out the water used for house hold chores.150 Casual allusions to other religious practices abound in the ser mons, but they lack the interest of these we have just seen. Dietary laws were the best-known of the Mosaic precepts and Iberian writers, both clerical and secular, often glossed and derided them. The Jews' abhorrence for pork, in particular, had become a conventional topic of satire. A personal note, worthy of attention, is one which Antonio Corrêa inserts into this trite matter. He refuses to believe that the Jews really abstain from pork, hare or the skin of fish, for, if this were really the case, these would be handed out free in the streets.151 Whether this is a hint at the large number of Judaizers — magnified by the bewildered imagination of the anti-Semitic clergy — or merely reflects the belief that Christian merchants would gladly cooperate in testing the religious sincerity of their customers can only be guessed. The conditions under which the Marranos had to live made fur tiveness the first rule of their religious activities. The observance of festivals, especially, was beset with grave dangers, and thus many of them were soon neglected or forgotten. Among the few exceptions were the Sabbath and Passover celebrations. To solemnize the tradi tional day of rest, the Judaizers wore clean shirts, put new wicks into their candles, polished the candlesticks,152 and did many things 14י Barata, p. 65. 148 Pedro Corrêa, foil. 3v-4r. 14' Diogo da Annunciaçam Justiniano (1710), p. 12.

And, elsewhere, fol. 85v, he writes: ". . . tambem guardâo ordens, ou superstiçoens, pondo o cutello na garganta, &amp; bulindo para cima, &amp; para baixo, &amp; se mattassem o animal leuando o cutello para cima, sem tornar para baixo, fica a carne delle immunda . . .

The same holds true for their prayers, since the destruction of Hebrew texts and the progressive weakening of the oral tradition had deprived them of a proper guide. Compulsory attendance at Church under the watchful eyes of inquisitorial agents and a distrustful population did not leave room for more than a slight and secretive deviation from accepted practices. Jewish malice is credited with having adapted Christian prayers in such a way that they often circumvented de tection. The Pater Noster and the Ave Maria became supplications to Moses simply by suppression of certain formulas of the litany such as Amen Jesu; similarly, the psalms of David were de-christianized by the omission of the Gloria Patri.15S The same technique was used for Catholic fasts which were dedicated to the memory of Queen Esther.157 This is no longer a matter of laughter, and drollery yields to the customary barrage of taunts: "I confess that I cannot under stand such brutality and delirium. The Law says that Moses is only a man, but you, in order to observe this Law, affirm that Moses is your God. The Pater Noster and the Ave Maria are prayers which the Law of Grace teaches us, and you, in supposed compliance with the Old Law, direct them to Moses. What mixtures are those that you are making?"1s8 3.

That they clung, notwithstanding a display of Christian piety and zeal, to whatever vestiges of Judaism their families had preserved, caused the fathers genuine concern.159 The rabid anti-Semites among them quickly dismissed the Christianism of the converts as a smoke screen behind which they could sully and mock with safety the most sacred symbols of the Faith.160 Some more conscientious fathers strove to determine the doctrinal misconceptions which led at least a few neophytes to accept a religious dualism.

The Neo-Christian apostates are likened to men of two tongues each of which, according to the circumstances, eulogizes a different creed.166 They are compared with statues — which Moses forbade to their fathers — because they too are "... pure deceit. . . men on the outside [devout Catholics], and stone on the inside [obstinate Judaizers at heart].167 And even a bird of such mythological dignity as the swan is degraded to a symbol of Jewish duplicity: "Among the birds which God formerly neither wanted nor tolerated in his sacrifices was the swan . . . Do you know why? Because the swan moves in two elements, earth and water; half here, half there; now meat, now fish; once flying, then swim ming . . . Oh, Jewish people, you also move in two elements!. . . Behold them here, see them there . . . They are limping on each foot. On the outside, they move in the Law of Christ; but within they move in the Law of Moses. Christians by mouth, Jews at heart. In appearance a white swan, but inside, a black crow."168 Characterizing the Marranos as chimeras, Father Miguel de Bulhoens states bluntly that the Neo-Christians are in reality men without a Law and without a God, an opinion shared by a great many clergymen of the time.169 It follows that the accused are either idolaters or, even worse, athe ists.170 This is the most serious indictment of Judaism: it is a doctrine which, by teaching ceremonies and rites rejected by the Creator, ultimately leads to a denial of God. For a nation which traced its very existence to the direct intervention of Christ on the battlefield of Ourique, this "abominable error" by itself would have amply jus tified the most stringent measures of repression.

The speakers endeavor to cast full light on the Jew as an individual and as a social entity, and the qualities which they reveal in doing so are precisely those which one would associate with the assassins of God the Son. In an age in which the sincerity of one's religious devotion was the primary criterion for judging a person's worth, it was quite easy to establish that atheists, such as the Judaizers, were the scum of the earth. The Jews' passionate and unjustified hatred of Christ is the clue to their social conduct.171 It has created in them a wicked disposition,172 reflected not only in their enmity toward the Church,173 the mistreat ment of the Host when most likely to go unnoticed174 and in ritual murders;175 but it also expresses itself in a fierce animosity toward all Old Christians.176 As ruthless enemies of the human species,177 they have substituted a new tenet for the Christian axiom of neighborly love: wrong the Catholics whenever you can.178 That there is no warrant for their dislike of pure-blooded Christians does not diminish its intensity. The Crypto-Jews spit at the shadow of Catholics,179 and it was held that none of the latter ever passed away whose death they had not fervently desired.180 In their prayers they ask God to 17י Ambrosio de Jesu, fol. 7V; Antonio da Ressurreyçam, Sermam . . .

And with good reason, for today one does not know of a weaker, more pitiable and pusilanimous nation than that of the Jews."187 That this transformation is a consequence of their disbelief is beyond dispute. Small wonder then that the Jews should have become the most vilified and despised nation on earth.188 There could be no graver insult than to call somebody a Jew, and this was true even among the Romans. It is well known that triumphant generals and Caesars used to assume as appellatives the names of the lands they had conquered. Titus and Vespasian, however, the victors of Judea, refused to call themselves ludaicus, because they realized that such an ignominious name would only tarnish their honor.189 In modern times, the legend has it that even the Moors spared no pains to show their contempt for Judaism. If a Jew wished to become a Moslem, he was required by law to embrace Christianity first; the Mohametans hoped that baptism would reduce somewhat the infamy of having been a Jew.190 2.2. GREED Even a sketchy portrayal of the Jews must deal with a contradiction which defines their nature. This dichotomy can best be described in the words of Father Manoel da Encarnaçam: "... a people, coarse and blind in spiritual matters, but lynx-eyed in worldly affairs."191 Their ambition and haughtiness knows no limits, and wealth alone opens gates for them which otherwise would remain closed. Accord ingly, the concern with riches absorbs the life of the Jews to such an 186 Bento de Sequeira (1642), fol. 11r. 187 Mendes de Tavora, fol. 5V. Costa Mattos, op. cit.; fol. 23", notices this trait even in the Jews of Biblical times: ". . . nào foy tâo grande multidâo poderosa, para que de algum modo mostrasse valor, a vista dos Egypcios que os seguiâo, &amp; elles venciaô em numéro, antes acolhidos a Moyses, chorauâo sua miseria podëdo liurar o remedio délia na pujança, &amp; nos braços." 188 Gomez, fol. 7V. 18י Moreira (1630), foil. 14v-15r; Coutinho, foil. 13v-14r&gt; and Telles, p. 19.

Moses is credited with having foreseen that materialism would domi nate the fancy of his people. Proof for the hypothesis is found in his having made the Hebrews drink the ashes of the Golden Calf, an incident which Luis Alvares glosses as follows: "Moses wanted to ex plain the nature of the Hebrews, putting the gold in their very entrails, giving to understand how deeply rooted is their sense of profit. One may remove the calf from before their eyes, but one shall not uproot the love of gold from their hearts. But Moses wanted the gold to pass first through the fire in order to give them a foreboding of their punishment. Let the gold first enter the fire before entering them, so that they may remember in their hearts the fires to which their greed and materialism are ultimately going to lead them."192 The craving for money is the leading determinant in the Jews' relations with the society in which they live. Far from contributing to the common welfare, they make a point of appropriating the produce of the toil of their Christian neighbors. This parasitism brings to Estevam de Sant' Anna's mind the following image: ". . . they are like the ivy; they cover you with their leaves. Everything is flattery, idle words. In their dealings, there are trickery and contracts which seem to favor and enrich you, but finally dry you up and destroy you as the ivy does the tree and the walls."193 Jewish predilection for gold thwarts their acceptance of Christ ianity. A religion which does not sanction usury, money-lending or deceit in commercial transactions holds little attraction for the Jews. Were such abuses tolerated by the Church, the apostates would be among the most fervent Catholics.194 Yet the riches for which they toil do not bring them happiness nor do they insure the felicity of their children. If the Marrancis were only capable of logical reasoning, ex perience would have disillusioned them long ago. All their striving is in vain, because, as unbelievers, they are sure to come into conflict with the Inquisition. The sentence imposed by the Holy Tribunal 13י Alvares, p. 11. Marco Antonio de Camos, Microcosmia, y govierno vniversal del del hombre christiano para todos los estados . . . (Madrid, 1595), II, 205, claims that the worldly possessions of a Jew who embraces Catholicism rightfully belong to the Church: . . los Iudios que oy se hallan, viuë de logro, y los bienes, que allegaron, fuerô con manifiesta vsura.

Their wealth, a Jew's whole bliss, far from giving them the coveted social status, serves merely to increase the national revenue, since it is confiscated in punishment of their heresies.195 Such sound argumentation fails to impress the neophytes, and our priests strongly feel that many of the Conversos believe in a possible connection between their unorthodox practices and financial pros perity. Some Judaizers, we are told, persuade vacillating members of their race to observe Jewish rites so that God will reward their faith fulness with temporal possessions.1'6 Lest this credence become en trenched, Father Pedro Corrêa scores the belief that economic gains depend upon ". . . . measuring the cloth with the yardstick of Moses ..." A ..." A rapid increase in one's fortune, he asserts, is a common event; behind financial prosperity lie only the persistent efforts of a hard working man.197 Since loyal devotion to the Faith is the basis of all human endeavors, it follows that heresy cannot lead to opulence. 3■ BODILY IMPERFECTIONS To make the likeness of the Jews even more odious, their purported bodily imperfections occasionally receive attention, though far less so than in other anti-Semitic tracts of the Golden Age. The topic provided Costa Mattos with sufficient material for a whole chapter of his Discurso. A diligent collector of all the anti-Jewish references and anecdotes found in his vast readings, the Portuguese priest does not omit a single detail, including even the famous ". . . flow of blood in the lower, private parts . . ."198 Our authors, surprisingly, do not dwell at length on these details, either because they shy from hurting unnecessarily the pride of the accused or because the matter appears to them unworthy of their consideration. The peculiar shape of the so-called "Jewish" nose elicits some strange comments from Father José do Espirito Santo: "When the Jew runs foul of his nose, when he remembers that he is a Jew by birth, he can by no means look toward the right.

RACIALISM The concept which the priests held of the Jews would scarcely merit extended consideration, had they confined themselves to deriving Jewish hatefulness from unbelief. Their Judenbild, however, receives a distinctly modern tinge from the racial bias which permeates their thinking. The reader or listener is given to understand that blindness, ignorance, and even a "heart of stone" could be cured, but there remains one factor defying treatment: Jewish blood. This is a "hered itary disease," which fastens on the embryo in the womb.201 So powerful a force is Jewish blood that Valerio de Sâo Raymundo feels compelled to state: "It is to be deeply regretted, I confess, that the very fact of having Jewish blood is equivalent to being a defiler of Christ's Law."202 It blocks out reasoning, precludes persuasion, and eventually triumphs over the Faith.203 His "blood" irresistibly sways the Neo-Christian toward heresy. Were this racialism inflexible, it would not only vitiate the praise so freely bestowed on egregious converts, but would also counter the teachings of the Church. Our fathers extricate themselves from this dilemma by paying homage, in passing, to those who, in spite of the ". . . sin of blood and nature . . .,"2°4 remained loyal to Christ's doctrine. That many persons of Hebrew extraction turned out to be devout Catholics, is held to redound to the greater glory of God. Therefore, at the beginning of the speech, the orator often asserts most emphatically (protesto, advirto) that his remarks are aimed only at the apostates.205 Such a safeguarding clause, however, disappears under a subsequent avalanche of allusions which establishes, for the 1" Op. cit.-, p. 5. 200 Sermào . . .

Heredity is also at the root of the Jews' anti-social behavior. Perverseness, malice and hypocrisy are qualities imposed by their cursed race.206 Being innate vices their correction is a task bordering on the impossible: "As the Abyssinian cannot cease being black as he was brought into the world by his mother, nor the mixed-blood change the variety of colors with which nature adorned him, in the same way it is impossible for the Hebrew people to perform good deeds and to live cognizant of its guilt, however much they are admonished and punished. For with their mother's milk they absorbed and learned every wickedness; an inborn vice is hard to correct."207 In view of the potential Jewish peril, criteria for identifying all the individuals pertaining to this nefarious nation must be established. Judaism, as we have seen, is a hereditary disease which acts like any other contagion; accordingly even the smallest portion of Jewish blood produces disastrous results. The fathers feel justified in giving the term "Jew" the broadest possible meaning; for them it includes all those individuals who by any stretch of imagination can be linked to Jewry: ". . . in order for these [the Marranos] to be born enemies of Christ by ancestry and blood, it is by no means necessary that both parents be practicing Jews. It seems that one is enough (such is the contagion of this wicked people). It is not necessary that this be the father, but the mother is sufficient. And even she does not have to be a full-blooded Jewess, one-half Jewish ancestry is sufficient. Not even that much is required, as a fourth of Jewish ancestry suffices and, indeed, less is required, for our times have shown that one eighth is adequate. God help me, that such a mighty effect should have so small a cause!"208 Some authors, given to hyperbole, claim that a nail, or one drop of Jewish blood is sufficient to soil an illustrious Christian lineage.209 To arrest the spread of this epidemic various measures are favored. Surprisingly, intermarriages are openly criticized only by Father Joâo de Ceita.210 It bears mentioning that Costa Mattos is charmingly 206 Antonio das Chagas, p. 10. Cf.

Mixed marriages, especially those in volving members of the Portuguese nobility, are, for him, unmistakable evidence of approaching divine punishment. At the same time he sees a Jewish conspiracy in the Marrano practice of marrying solely close relatives.211 Nothing short of collective suicide would probably have mollified his rancor. The priests recommend above all restrictions against Jews in delicate positions which for them means ecclesiastical dignities. The allegedly large number of Neo-Christians in religious orders truly alarm them and Manoel dos Anjos advises: "There is no reason why one should tolerate tares among pure, clean wheat. Rather, they ought to be extirpated."212 Especially dangerous are the Marranos as secular priests since they seek such positions only to blaspheme the sacraments entrusted to them.213 Jews in professional capacities, comments as follows on the number of mixed unions: ". . . os christâos nouos estâo jà incorporados, &amp; misturados cô os Christâos velhos, de maneira que nâo ha familia nenhùa de consideraçâo, em q nâo haja muitos homes, &amp; muitas molheres partici pantes do sangue Hebreo ..." Intermarriages are criticized also in purely literary works. Sebastian de Horozco, Cancionero, ed. Antonio Martin Gamero (Sevilla, 1874), p. 258, for example, writes: "Y asi es consejo sano / para contentos vivir, / que xpiana con xpiano / y marrana con marrano / procuren de se enxerir. / Y quien es xpiano viejo, por codicia de ducados / no tome tan mal consejo / de querer mudar pellejo / haziendo hijos manchados." Francisco Santos (1639 [?]-1700), El no importa importa de Espana ((Madrid, 1787), p. 171, voices similar criticism: "Mucho me admira, que un hombre como vos, no teniendo mas de una hija y que Dios os ha dado hazienda, querais emplear la flor de vuestro matrimonio tan mal, pues se de cierto que ese mozo que por yerno admitis es hijo de gente de sospecha; y no tan poca que no haya quien diga que su padre fue penitenciado por aquel Tribunal que enarbola una Espada y una Oliva . . . por vuestra vida que 10 mireis mejor, y sin pasion y no os ceguèis precipitado porque una vez hecho serà irremediable el dolor que os asistirà ..." 211 211 Op. cit.-, foil. 13v and 64v-65r.

There is no concerted campaign against the often defamed Jewish physicians and pharmacists, the butt of all Iberian anti-Semitic tracts, nor is the Jews' exclusion from the universities advocated with fervor. This omission can hardly be interpreted as tacit approval; it would be more correct to assume that the fathers do not put too much faith in purely temporal measures. For the fight against a gifted, resourceful and unscrupulous enemy, Portugal counts only upon one reliable weapon : the always vigilant Holy Office for which the speakers tirelessly intone paeans of praise. Toward the middle of the fifteenth century the Spanish convert Alonso de Cartagena wrote a learned treatise to further his dream of the unitas Christiana. For the son of the former Solomon ha-Levi it was insanissimum et sceleratissimum to establish distinctions between Christians, based on the religion of their forefathers. Availing himself of his considerable theological knowledge Alonso de Cartagena could prove his main thesis: "Constat. . . quod filii iniquitas nunquam ad patrem ascendit, ergo nec iniquitas patris ad filium descendit, sed unusquisque ex propria iudicatur."214 He and many neophytes of his time may have hoped that the Church would eventually espouse with vigor this tenet rather than pay lip service to it. The Portuguese Neo-Christians of the seventeenth century could entertain no such illusions. The morbid racialism of the Lusitanian clergy branded them as clearly as did the distinctive marks which they had been compelled to wear before their conversion. For all practical purposes they were degraded to the level of second-rate citizens for no other crime than their lineage. While racial bias effectively prevented their smooth absorption into Portuguese society, a danger that the fathers feared, it must also have had consequences which they did not foresee. The sustained and brutal attacks against a segment of the population whose contribution to Portuguese achievements far exceeded its pro portional strength in the nation can only have fortified the religious fervor, and with it the pride, of the most conscientious elements among the Marranos. Ecclesiastic persecution can probably claim more credit for the survival of Judaism than, as the fathers would have it, the decrepit grandmothers or the ominous sangue (blood). Op. cit.; p. 189. Another illustrious convert, Fernando del Pulgar (1436 [?] 1493 [?]) entertained similar ideas on the subject.

"insuperable rival of mercy and justice"215 After Forced Conversion, the establishment of the Inquisition in Portugal was the most fateful event for the descendants of Lusitanian Jewry. Only too familiar with the aims and methods of the Holy Tribunal in neighboring Spain, the Portuguese Neo-Christians did their best to prevent the enforcement of the relevant papal brief. The sordid story of the intrigues and extortions, which characterized the negotiations in Rome, has been told eloquently by the Portuguese historian and writer, Alexandre Herculano.216 Although the clerical faction, strongly supported by the crown, finally won out, the Mar ranos never ceased making representations to the papacy in order to call attention to the abuses committed under the pretext of up holding the purity of the Faith. While the results of these efforts were far from encouraging — merely a few general pardons were secured which, however, were, as a rule, followed by waves of per secutions — the Inquisitors may, nevertheless, have felt the need of gainsaying the assertions of their victims. The large audiences at autos-da-fé, representative of all segments of the population, made, them an ideal forum for a propagandists counter-offensive. Striking "s Ferreyra, p. 3.

That the latter were too frightened to speak up made the apology all the easier for our priests. The enemies of the Holy Office, in their attacks, lay stress on its being a modern institution, an argument likely to carry weight with a tradition-minded people, distrustful of rtovedades (new ways). That the formal organization of the Holy Tribunal is of recent date can hardly be denied; but earlier beginnings may possibly be found for the spirit which inspires this enterprise. This is an idea to which our authors cling; anxious to enhance the prestige of the Inquisition they declare that it was, in a slightly different form, already functioning in Biblical times. That God Himself can rightly be considered the First Inquisitor is proved with a neat tour deforce: "... so honorable is this task that God himself performed it when the first delinquent arose. God will remain in the position of a general and supreme Inquisitor until the end of the world. In the life of each one the evidence for his trial is being gathered, and at the Last Judgment the final sentence will be pronounced."217 Christ and the Holy Ghost also shouldered, we are told, the heavy burden of Inquisitors.218 The same honor is bestowed upon an impressive array of Biblical figures such as Moses, David, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.219 An institution so deeply rooted in the tradition of the Church cannot be conceived as wanting in mercy and kindness; allegations to the contrary must be dismissed as vicious distortions. Its shield is symbolic of the spirit of the Holy Office, for it shows both an olive tree, the emblem of clemency, and a sword, representing the rigor of justice. The many possible interpretations of the two symbols are a favorite topic of our authors. The green of the olive tree stands for the hope which the Holy Tribunal holds out to repentant sin ners;220 it appears at the right hand — the one more often used — to ל1־ Ambrosio de Jesu, fol. lr; cf. also Pinheiro, p. 31, and Coutinho, fol. 18r_T. 18נ Viegas, pp. 1-2, and Ceita, fol. 15'.

True enough, it has a sharp point and fine edges, but, taken by the handle, denoting the Cross, it offers protection.223 Such is the perfection of this tribunal that it may rightly serve as a model for other courts. The secretiveness of its procedures is exemplary and therefore ". . . when we refer to a 'secret of the In quisition' we mean it is the most privileged of all secrets."224 Proofs which are adequate from the viewpoint of human laws fail to quiet the scruples of the Inquisitors. All the circumstances of every case are subjected to a conscientious scrutiny, and testimony rendered suspicious by personal antagonism is immediately discarded.225 The task of the ministers of the Holy Office consists of a more demanding chore than merely pronouncing sentence, since they ought to save the accused from the consequences of their obstinacy and blindness. They are seen pleading diligently with the culprits, and, indeed, their efforts on behalf of the Conversos make them appear more as their lawyers than as their judges.226 With all this, the magistrates of the Inquisition are still open to considerable criticism. Many good Christians find that the Holy Office is going too far in the leniency accorded to the Judaizers. A typical recrimination reads: "Gentlemen, why do you show so much clemency in view of such obstinacy? Why so much mercy, where perfidy and unbelief are steadily growing? Why do you overlook and forgive, if there is so little hope of correcting an evil so ancient?"227 Such a Torres, p. 27. 322 Diogo da Annunciaçam Justiniano (1710), p. 34. 223 Joseph de Oliveyra (1691), p. 47. 223 Areda, fol. 18r. 225 Sousa, foil. 14v-15r, and Telles, pp. 32-33. Ionar Abarbanel (Elogios . . ., p. 93) scores the legal fiction of the so-called "relaxation": "O tribunal cruel injusto, impio / Vengue el Dios de venganças tus ficciones / Que dando la sentencia a tu aluidrio / Con pluma agena cubres tus traiciones / La pidra [sic] tiras de veneno frio / Ocultando las manos de Nerones, / Hipocritas con capa de piedades / Iuezes sin justicia y sin verdades." 226 Valerio de Sâo Raymundo, p. 26. Cf. also Ferreyra, p. 23, and Christovam de Santa Maria, p. 6. Ionar Abarbanel (Elogios . . ., p. 148) has a different concept of inquisitorial justice: "Que caiga la idolatria, / Por flaca; teneis temor, / Y por materia de estado, / Sustentais la inquisicion. / No por zelo de las leyes, / De la Romana intervencion, / Mas para comer el pan, / Sin trabajo, y sin sudor." 22' Gomez, fol. 14'.</page><page sequence="45">[45] INVITATION TO INTOLERANCE 371 reproach, while motivated by righteous ardor, falls short of under standing the nature of inquisitorial proceedings. The Inquisition, taking its model from the justice of God, in fact being the Tribunal of God, is naturally disposed to forgiveness. Its ministers realize that Faith depends upon both understanding and inclination; kindness then would go a long way toward inspiring affection for the teachings of Christ.228 The clemency of God's Tribunal certainly cannot be im puted to a lack of zeal; rather it must be seen as politico, do Ceo (art of divine government),229 that is to say, as true Christian piety which restrains the Inquisitors in the punishment of the culprits. That this clemency has clearly defined limits is expressly stated : those who cannot be won over by gentle persuasion must be delivered to the flames.230 Nevertheless, the purported excessive leniency arouses the appre hensiveness of some speakers who take it upon themselves to warn the Inquisitors against the dangers inherent in their policy of "ap peasement." Manoel Evangelista stresses that mercy for Jews is wasted mercy.231 André Gomez, recalling that ". . . if Christ forgave a thief, he was a crucified and punished thief. . .," concludes with a passionate appeal for an intensification of repressive measures: "Since you are the atlantes who sustain the weight of our Holy Faith, since you are responsible for the honor of God, the glory of Christ, the fame and reputation of the Christians of this kingdom, be vigilant, remain on guard, cut out or burn the roots of so much evil. Let us all be zealous in offering our wholehearted support. . ."232 The speakers' comments on the general pardons — temporary reprieves during the campaign of incessant persecution — afford an excellent illustration of the compassion which the Inquisition felt for Neo-Christian offenders. Gregorio Taveira expressed wishful thinking 328 Sousa, fol. 15r; Coutinho, foil. 18v-19r, and Christovam de Almeida, pp. 54-55. 22' Vieyra, p. 22. 23° Couto, fol. 21r.

For unreasonable beasts are taught by blowes, but men are taught by reason. Nor are men perswaded to other opinions, by torments, but rather, on the contrary they become more firm, and constant in their Tenet." For an interpretation sui generis of the Spanish Inquisition see Robert Korner und Theodor Pugel, eds., Antisemitismus der Welt in Wort und Bild (Dresden, 1935), p. 75: "Der Grossinquisitor Spaniens war der getaufte Jude Torquemada, dessen Blutdurst Ffunderttausende arisch-christlicher Menschen zum Opfer fielen." 231 Op. cit.-, fol. 17r.

They hoped that royalty and the popes would profit from these lessons so that similar requests will not be heeded in the future.234 Somewhat more crude is their expectation that the continued drain on Jewish resources will make it impossible for them to "finance" any future negotiations for a general pardon.235 The exceptionally high standards of this incorruptible tribunal, however, do not deter the venomous attacks of the Judaizers. They proclaim insolently that the Devil introduced the Inquisition in Por tugal.236 To give the lie to these detractors, God "authorized" the noble institution with sixty miracles, and His angels are understood to have acted on occasions as familiars of the Holy Office.237 The Inquisition, like any other court of justice, bases its verdicts on the testimonies which it receives. Naturally, the Neo-Christians impugn the authenticity of the denunciations and confessions made to it. But such a refutation is a two-edged weapon which can be turned against the defamers themselves, for it is invariably the deposition of Marranos which leads to inquisitorial action.238 The declarations of Old Christians, as a rule, favor the Crypto-Jews; they confirm that the Neo-Christians attend church regularly, are active in the brother hoods and often seek confession.239 A different story is told by those *33 Op. cit.-, fol. 3r.

The father attests to the heresy of his son, the son bears testimony against his father, relatives and friends denounce each other.240 Therefore, it is completely absurd for the priests to speak about false testimonies against the Conversos. Often as many as sixty witnesses are asked to testify, and yet there is never the slightest discrepancy in their declarations with regard to the names of their accomplices, their observances, the dates and places of their gatherings. Even recalcitrant sinners who only confess at the last moment, overcome by the fear of death, bear out and confirm all the allegations of their accusers.241 If, however, an innocent is condemned, the blame should be laid not to the Inquisitors, who painstakingly investigate every case, but to the malice of the Jews who deceive them by falsely accusing their own brethren.242 How unfounded Jewish protests against inquisitorial cruelty are can also be inferred from the behavior of the Marranos released from prison. There is evidence that the flames of the stakes frightened them into admitting their errors; but the glare of this fire, as the contemporary metaphor had it, is insufficient to illuminate for them the beauty of truth.243 They come to take for granted the excessive clemency shown to them, and are not long in observing once more the very same rites they had foresworn. The Jews as a whole show open disrespect for the Holy Tribunal. The condemned who had "collaborated" with the Inquisition are rejected and despised after their release.244 Those tested in their Judaism (laureados pello judaismo), on the other hand, are held in the highest esteem,243 and the female defendants, in particular, are assured of making a good marriage.246 240 Mello, fol. 17M, and Moreira (1645), pp. 17-18. With nauseating cynicism the fathers assert that Jewish parents are the worst enemies of their own children.

The dungeons to which they are confined can properly be termed their door to heaven.247 The ministers of the Holy Tribunal, receiving them with love and kindness, labor incessantly so that they will embrace the Law of Grace.248 The Judaizers enter the prisons blind, but their eyes are opened there; during their detention they are properly taught how to seek salvation. They come as Jews and leave as God-fearing Catholics, and thus their happiness begins.249 The temporal hardships they have to endure are, when seen from a long range point of view, a blessing, because they save them from the far more formidable torments of eternal chains.250 2. TOWARD AN APOTHEOSIS OF THE HOLY TRIBUNAL That Portuguese Christians as well owe abiding respect and deep veneration to the Holy Office is impressed upon the audience from the very beginning of the sermons. In addressing the ministers of the Inquisition our speakers use a whole string of emphatic appellations which tend to become more and more hyperbolical as time advances. A representative specimen reads: "Incorruptible tribunal of our faith, firm and unshakable foundation of the truth of our doctrine, austere example of true justice, living image of the greatest mercy to whose zeal the Catholic Church is indebted for the conversion of innumerable heretics and our Portugal for the preservation of faithful Catholic hearts."251 In a similar vein, Christovam de Santa Maria writes: "Holy, wise and incorruptible tribunal without peer of our Holy Faith, fierce defender of Catholic Truth, firm pillar of the Christian Religion, faithful guardian of the honor and rites of the true God, death to the wicked, life and spirit of the righteous . . ."252 These invocations state in concise terms one of the theses to be developed prindo a penitencia, todas as vezes que sahia fora chamaua antes . . . sua vizinha, &amp; dizialhe, venha vossa merce &amp; verâ se vou gentilhomem . .

No praise can be extravagant that is bestowed on the august body charged with this heavy burden. Lest anybody fail to assimilate this truth, its labors and accomplishments are repeatedly extolled in the speeches through a great variety of images and metaphors. In view of the special functions of the Inquisition, it is only fitting that military images, in particular those which suggest defense or watchfulness, should predominate. The inquisitorial procession brings to mind an Army of the Lord triumphing over His enemies.253 The Inquisitors are, for our authors, guardians who imitate "... the Angels watching over the walls of the Church Militant.. ."254 They are seen as towers, castles or walls, containing the onslaught of heresy;255 they are called ". . . the sheep-dogs of Christ's flock . . ."256 Finally, the Inquisitors are the ever-alert eyes watching over the Church of Christ.257 The continuance of their drudgery evokes the tasks of a gardener who must daily ". . . tear out thorns, burn weeds . . ."258 or of a diligent farmer who tries to keep the evangelical wheat free from the poison weed of Judaism.259 To enhance further inquisitorial prestige, the speakers draw on the Bible in search for appropriate comparisons. The ministers are termed ". . . cherubim full of wisdom . . .;"26° they are likened to the angels on Jacob's ladder, since they too exert themselves to reconcile the patriarch's descendants with God.2C1 Such oratorical pyrotechnics, if they set out the manifold duties of the Inquisition, fail to do full justice to its rôle within the total organization of the Church. The enthusiastic words of praise found at the beginning of the sermons establish clearly that, for the speakers, the Holy Tribunal is entitled to claim a pre-eminent place in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. It was, however, left to a Portuguese Jesuit from the Far East to come up with a panegyric, the verve of which can hardly be matched by other tributes to its glory: "... very aptly «3 Coutinho, fol. 17v. 254 Antonio das Chagas, p. 43. 255 Thomâs de Sâo Cyrillo, fol. 6r-v, and Caietano de Sâo Joseph, p. 57. 256 Sousa, fol. 14'. 2s' Christovam de Almeida, pp. 55-56. 258 Coutinho, fol. 17'. 259 Costa Soarez, fol.

Portugal in the Fight Against Jewry I.I. A SHORT HISTORY OF THE ORIGIN OF LUSITANIAN MARRANOS While religious and social questions of a universal character hold at length the attention of our speakers, they are far from indifferent to the specific problems of Portugal. The cancer of Judaism threatens the very existence of the state to the same extent that it endangers the church. The complete accord between national and ecclesiastic interests enables our fathers to fight back against the Jews as so many soldiers of the Ecclesia militans and as patriots. That the Portuguese, a people proud of their rigid observance of Catholicism, should have to harbor an exceptionally large number of heretics in their midst, is cause for grave concern. What exacerbates popular sentiment is the realization that these disbelievers are not of Lusitanian stock, but strangers, established and tolerated in their country. How they were able to gain admission to Portugal is a topic often treated by the speakers. In the rewriting of this episode for the benefit of the audience, historical truth fares badly at the hands of the priests. The blame for the admittance of the Jews cannot be laid to a lack of foresight on the part of King John II, because the venerable figures of the Lusitanian monarchs always remain above criticism. Rather the nation as a whole must shoulder the responsibility for the fateful measure, since by its sins it provoked God into visiting such an affliction on the country.263 The Portuguese crown clearly understood the dangers inherent in a prolonged tolerance of this sect, and John IPs successor, Manuel, decreed the expulsion of all those who refused to embrace Christianism. Needless to say, such a measure is wholeheartedly endorsed by the speakers who spill much ink over King Manuel's generosity. The sovereign, they point out, gave full freedom to those who theoretically 262 Areda, fol. 17r. Cf. Joseph dos Anjos, p. 10. 263 Estevam de Sant'Anna, foil. 13v-14r, and Mendes de Tavora, fol. 23'. Only Costa Mattos, op. cit.-, fol. 65', dares to criticize King Manuel: . . isto se deue entre impresas tâo gloriosas aos desnecessarios fauores que el Rey Do Emanuel lhes [i. e. the Jews] fez aquelles mesmos dias em que os outros se fizeraô gloriosos com sua destruiçaô . .</page><page sequence="51">[51] INVITATION TO INTOLERANCE 377 had become his slaves. If he denied the Jews ships for the voyage to Africa, it was only to prevent their worshipping Allah; on the other hand, he showered them with royal favors, and in his kindness even granted them a general pardon, not because of any temporal interests, but to save them from certain perdition.264 That this ex pulsion was, as a matter of fact, a thinly disguised form of forced conversion is nowhere mentioned nor is there the slightest hint that this was a flagrant breach of a royal pledge. Even the compulsory separation of Jewish minors from their parents for the purpose of Catholic indoctrination is unreservedly approved. The fathers do not omit in silence that excesses were committed; however, it is not official repression that arouses their anger, but the actions of some Jewish mothers who killed their children rather than hand them over to the authorities to be brought up as Christians.265 That the uncertainty over the children's future or the fear of "experiments," such as the colonization of St. Thomé, may have stirred the mothers to so tragic a step is never taken into consideration. Royal bounty, however, could not overcome Jewish pertinacity, and Manuel's policy ended in failure. A sincere conversion was out of the question and, as a result of the decree of expulsion, only a handful of devout Jews left while many Iudeos fingidos (Crypto-Jews) remained behind. Their numerous descendants show no willingness to amend the ways learned from their forebears, nor are they any more anxious to leave Portugal than their fathers were. The latter fact provides the churchmen with food for thought — (they do not bother to take into account minutiae such as the legal restrictions against the emigration of Neo-Christians) — especially in view of Jewish allegations concerning inquisitorial persecution.266 Nevertheless, 6נ&lt; Castelbranco, p. 33. Amador Arraiz, Bishop of Portalegre, discusses different views on the validity of this forced baptism in his Dialogos (Coimbra, 1589), foil. 45r-47r• a6s Ceita, fol. 7V, and Manoel dos Anjos (1629), fol. 16v. Aboab, op. cit.; pp. 307 308, stresses that these measures brought about divine retribution: "Y muchas vezes oi dezir â mi senor Ishac Aboab que sea en gloria: Mirad hijos las prueuas tan eui dentes de la diuina prouidencia; que el Rey don Iuan Segundo, que tan sin razon aparto 10s innocentes hijos, del amoroso aspecto de sus padres, y 10s mandé lleuar â las Islas de 10s Lagartos . . . despues muriô en 10 mejor de sus dias, no sin sospecha de veneno ... y dizen, que quando se muriô, gritaua en aquel vltimo trance, diziendo: Quitenme de aqui â estos ninos." 266266 Moreira (1645), pp. 16-17. Legal restrictions against the emigration of Conversos were removed by a Carta de Lei, entitled Aos ChristSos Novos privilegio, per per que EIRey the concede, que se possam ir pera onde quizerem, com outras mais graças nelle contheudas (Lisboa, 1773). Another decree, issued in the same year, implies</page><page sequence="52">378 EDWARD GLASER [52] they are not at a loss to explain the Jews' preference for Portugal. In all the other countries the Jews are constantly harassed, only Portugal tolerates them.267 Tolerance even is hardly the right word for the treatment dispensed to them there; it is truly their Promised Land, and their Paradise, because in Portugal every Jew is a king.268 2. THE JEWISH CONSPIRACY AGAINST PORTUGAL The exceptional privileges which the Jews enjoy in Portugal do not kindle in them any feelings of gratitude for this hospitable country. As they do everywhere else, they are scheming to cause as much harm as possible to their Christian neighbors.269 Father Francisco de Mendonça has recourse to a simile to shed full light on the Jewish menace to his country: "Tell me, if a man infected by plague entered this city without the knowledge of the public authorities, and if he walked through the squares, the streets, our Churches, our houses, speaking and dealing with everybody, what would happen to us? In two days the city would be ravaged by the plague. Well, this Jewish blindness is a plague if it moves among us without being detected. Portugal, I fear for you!"270 While such accusations do not go beyond what has been dealt with in the chapter about the general concept of the Jew, there are in the sermons also concrete references to Portugal's past and present history which justify a separate treatment. The priests' evaluations of Jewish contributions to Portugal are variations on the theme "Der"Der Jud ist schuld." There is, indeed, no event for which they cannot be a complete reversal in the official attitude toward the Neo-Christians. See the Carta de de Lei, Constituiçào Gérai, e Edicto Perpétuo por que Vossa Magestade . . .

"It is the opinion of many learned men who examine events with prudence and fear of God that one of the causes of the evils and tribulations, which the kingdom has suffered for so many years, is the presence of a great many Jews among us."271 Even the loss of Portuguese independence in the wake of King Sebastian's defeat on the battlefield of Alcacer-Quibir is laid to their door. That many Portuguese and Sebastian's devout uncle, Philip II of Spain, vigorously objected to this quixotic adventure is left unmentioned. Sebastian's responsibility for the disaster is limited to the kindness with which he treated the Jews, thus inviting the wrath of heaven.272 Although our authors presumably do not wish to descend to the level of the accused by evincing an excessive concern for temporal affairs, it is mentioned in passing that Jewish support for Dutch shipping enterprises has seriously curtailed Iberian commerce.273 By far the most frequent and stirring accusation is that the Jews are deliberately ruining Portugal's excellent reputation abroad. The fathers, contemplating the spectacle of large autos-da-fé, repeated at short intervals in Coimbra, Evora, and Lisbon, cannot help won dering about the reaction of foreign public opinion, and there were those who argued that national interest required that the autos be held in secret.274 Some consolation is derived from the fact that as 371 Sousa, foil. 15T-16r. 373 Manoel dos Anjos (1629), fol. 21v. Aboab, op. cit.-, p. 308, holds the opposite view: . . permitiô el Seiior, que â la quarta generacion, viniesse quasi toda la nobleza de Portugal, y su Rey don Sebastian â Africa para seren [sic] destruidos, y captiuos en el mismo lugar, adonde sus abuelos, indigna, y cruelmente, mandaron â desembarcar los afligidos Israelitas.

Thus it is made clear to everybody that in Portugal Judaism cannot count on indulgent tolerance. An even more devastating blow to Portugal's international stature is the shocking behavior of Lusitanian Marranos who succeed in escaping to a foreign country. Wherever they take up residence, be it in Amsterdam, Livorno, or Pernambuco, those who have been nursed with "the milk of the Church" take advantage of the first opportunity to worship their idols.275 Small wonder then that other nations, unfamiliar with the piety of the true Portuguese, should be inclined to think that all Lusitanians are Jews. This credence is diffused throughout Europe and, consequently, many Portuguese are ashamed to admit their nationality abroad.276 A few particularly malicious foreigners, when speaking with a Portuguese, pretend that they have to find out first, whether he does not give out the smell characteristic of Jews.277 Using all his dialectical subtlety, Father Manoel Rebello makes a feeble attempt to prove that the return of Portuguese Neo Christians to Judaism in their foreign places of residence must enhance the prestige of the nation in Christian eyes, since it demonstrates conclusively . . that neither can our kingdom endure them, nor they the kingdom. The attitude of the kingdom toward them is comparable to that of the sea: just as the sea casts corpses upon these shores, so does our kingdom cast them out to the different parts of the world as if they were dead bodies."278 Castilla en Africa la reciven, y amparan; solo Portugal la desdena, y ni en las oca siones, q sus tesoros inestimables se juzgavan convenientes para ayudar en la defensa natural, pudo acavarse con nuestro Rey que afloxasse un instante en la entereça, y severidad, con que (como verdadero imitador de David) su zelo atiende a la honra de la casa del Senor." The emphatic assertions of Dom Francisco Manoel de Melo notwithstanding, Portugal, too, has recourse to the services of Jews, whenever necessary. See Panduronga S. S. Pissurlencar, Agentes da diplomacia portuguesa na Indiaîndia (Hindus, muçulmanos, judeus e parses) (Goa, 1952), pp. 551-564. 275 Mello, fol. 21r~v. A different story is told by Father Antonio Vieira, Obras inéditas inéditas (Lisboa, 1856), II, 57: "E agora morreu em Amsterdâo um pobre velho, que havendo em Portugal saido em um auto, foi lâ buscar segurança e remedio; e como os judeus o nâo quizessem favorecer por confessar publicamente a fé de Christo, sustentava-se o pobre . . . pescando com uma cana; e disse ao embaixador de Portugal, que por fama o quiz conhecer: Senhor, aqui ando perseguido dos judeus por christâo, e em Portugal fui perseguido dos christâos por judeu; mas ainda que na terra me faltam os homens, espero que no ceu me nâo ha de faltar Deus." 276 Sousa, fol. 12v. 277 Rebello, fol. 7V, and Moreira (1645), p. 21. 278 Op. cit.-, fol. 17v.</page><page sequence="55">[55] INVITATION TO INTOLERANCE 381 3• A PROGRAM FOR DEALING WITH THE JEWISH PROBLEM: SUPPORT OF THE INQUISITION — EXPULSION Powerful as the governors and kings of Portugal may be, they do not have at their disposal a weapon of their own, suitable for the fight against the enemy from within; they too must rely mainly on the vigilance of the ministers of the Holy Tribunal. The very existence of the kingdom would be at stake were the Inquisition abolished. Ambrosio de Jesu uses a clever word play to drive this point home: "... truly, if there were no Holy Office in this kingdom with such capable ministers, I do not know what would become of Portugal or, to be more correct, I know that Portugal would be no more."279 At best the kingdom would be a waste land;280 it seems, however, far more likely that God, incensed by the heresies of the Neo Christians, would have mercilessly destroyed the country, had not the Holy Tribunal striven to calm divine anger.281 The crown too has its strongest pillar in the Inquisition which, next to its ecclesiastic function as bastion of the Faith, also assumes the political task of defending the integrity of the state.282 A population divided in its religious allegiance is thought of — with disregard for the lessons of the past — as undermining the very foundations of the monarchy; conversely, religious uniformity, called purity, consti tutes an infallible guarantee for the stability and the prosperity of the nation.283 The interdependence of religious orthodoxy with national triumphs is an axiom for which proofs abound. Surely the re-establishment of Portuguese independence under King John IV (1640) is to be considered a reward from heaven for the enthusiastic support which the new sovereign has lent at all times to the Inquisition.284 This is an enlightened policy, for a vassal given to idolatry and heresy cannot be a loyal subject of a Catholic monarch. Thus the title Rey da India remained meaningless, until the Holy Office, by weeding out dis believers, had turned obedience to the House of Braganza into something more than legal fiction.28s The priests are then not exceeding their prerogatives, if they take advantage of the autos-da-fé to remind 2יל Op. cit.-, fol. 8r: . . eu nâo sey que fora de Portugal, ou sey que ja nâo fora." 280 Coutinho, fol. 17v. 281 Pinheiro, pp. 32-33. 282 Mendes de Tavora, fol. 25v. 283 Christovam de Almeida, p. 56. 28&lt; Moreira (1646), "d 22. 285 Areda, fol. 26v.</page><page sequence="56">[56] 382 EDWARD GLASER the king and his ministers how great the nation's debt to the Inqui sition is.286 (Such a strengthening of the Holy Office is not to be seen merely as a move beneficial from a political point of view; rather it is in keeping with the functions of the king of Portugal who, like every one of his subjects, has definite obligations toward the Church. The only difference lies in his responsibilities being heavier, since he has been chosen to act as the right arm of the Church.)287 While the capacity of the ecclesiastical authorities to cope with the Jewish problem in the long run cannot be questioned, there are some orators who feel that a more immediate and radical solution is preferable. Of course they realize that, as far as temporal affairs are concerned, they can only recommend and suggest, while the ultimate decision must rest with the national government. Neverthe less, they believe it their duty to bring to the attention of the ministers that there is an expedient way of dealing with Judaism: expulsion of the heretics from Portugal.288 Whether only those already sentenced or also potential offenders should be included in the pertinent law is not stated. Nor do the speakers address themselves to the thorny question where one should send the expellees. "Let them go wherever they wish. As long as they do not remain among us, let them stay wherever they want. Let us here shake them off, and he who wishes to stay clean elsewhere, let him, too, shake them off."28' That this is materia materia de estado (a concern of the national government) and, therefore, cannot be decided from the pulpit is a flimsy pretext which fails to conceal a thirst for vengeance not to be quelled by the most ruthless persecution. 786 Gomez, fol. 15v. 287 Sequeira (1642), fol.

To a people dreaming of its glorious past, and yet mindful of its present calamities, Father Joseph de Oliveyra points out a "modern" panacea that once more will lead the nation to the zenith of its power: It seems that the Prophet Isaiah, in his prophecy, was talking to Portugal : Educ foras populum caecum : Cast this blind people out, oh Portugal, from your native shores and your overseas possessions, chastise them with extermination. By means of their extermination it is given to Portugal to secure the fulfillment of the happy promise, made by Christ Crucified on the battlefield of Ourique, that she will be an Empire: Volo in te, &amp; in semine tuotuo mihi imperium stabilité.29" Actum Actum Est Contra Iudaeos (Conclusions) Peninsular anti-Semitism may not be traced only to ecclesiastic agitation for its origin. Hatred of the Jews was so firmly entrenched in the popular mind that it required very little stirring, and there may be even a grain of truth in the claims of the apologists for the Inquisition that this "legalized" repression often forestalled the ter rors of mob violence.291 One can, however, scarcely underestimate the rôle of the Church in preserving at the highest level of intensity the already powerful prejudices of the masses. The sermons preached at autos-da-fé — in particular those which later circulated in book form — went a long way toward spurring the campaign of hatred and degradation. Alexandre da Paixâo, op. cit.-, p. 166: "Se Christo lança aos que vendem / No templo sancto de Deos; / Onde hào de parar Iudeus, / Que mais gravemente o offendem? / Ah Senhor! Daqui dependem, / Ou muitos bens, ou hum mal, / Vâ-se esta turba infernal / Por esses mares alèm, / Porque a Deos, e a nos convèm, / Nâo ficar em Portugal."Portugal." 290 Op. cit. (1691), pp. 40-41. 291 See, for example, Bernardino Llorca, op. cit.-, pp. 80-81: . . fueron bastante numerosos 10s relajados por la Inquisiciôn en sus diversos tribunales.

Their technique is best described by the brilliant phrase with which James Parkes characterized the patristic diatribes of the fourth century: "The Fathers obtained the perspective of a distorting mirror and drew faithfully what they saw."2'2 Like their patristic models whom they followed closely, the Portuguese avoid as a rule references to specific persons or incidents. The object of their attacks is a nebulous, vast social entity, vaguely defined as Os Judeus. But in this ambiguity lies the strength of their broadside, for, by virtue of this generalization, their speeches become dragnets of defamation from which there is no escape for anyone defiled by Jewish blood. Such was the anti-Jewish zeal of the Portuguese priests, however, that they went far beyond the limits which the Early Church Fathers had set for their censures. Patristic authors dealt exclusively with the evils wrought by the Jews of Biblical times; the doings of their Jewish contemporaries did not merit their attention. For the Lusi tanian fathers such a partial presentation of Jewish wickedness would have amounted to dereliction in their duty. Their aim was to show that there is no difference between those who danced around the Golden Calf in the desert and their descendants who on Fridays polish their candlesticks in Coimbra. Murderers of Christ in Jerusalem or desecrators of the Host in Evora, they are one and the same and worthy only of utmost contempt and severe punishment. The sermons offer a short history of Jewry which, according to the priests, has invariably retained throughout the centuries two essential charac teristics: a defiance of God and an irrepressible enmity toward all non-Jews. Since professing Jews had been expelled from Portugal in 1507, the fathers' anti-Jewish wrath had to be vented against the next-best substitute, the Marranos. That many of them may have clung to Judaism is less significant than the fact that their origin (sangue) rather than their actions became prima-facie evidence of heresy. This approach to the Conversos constituted a resolute espousal of racialism and, as a result, national, social, and economic considerations tended to balance religious motives in the attack against Jewry. Regardless of whether they speak for the Church or for their nation, the fathers evince no interest in a positive solution to the Jewish question. As victims of their own propaganda which has built up an imaginary enemy to frightening proportions, they are only able to think in "2 The conflict of the Church and the Synagogue. A study in the origins of anti emitism (London, 1934), p. 158.</page><page sequence="59">[59] INVITATION TO INTOLERANCE 385 terms of preventive measures, expulsion or even extermination. Their anti-Semitic frenzy, by depriving them of the last vestiges of evan gelical fervor, must have seriously diminished their usefulness as servants of Christ. By the same token, they also frequently failed in discharging their duties toward the nation which looked to them for leadership; they contented themselves with being the acclaimed spokesmen for the rabble. The assertion of the bibliographer Innocencio Francisco da Silva that these sermons are ". . . monuments of the wisdom and learning of our theological polemicists . . ."293 has, for the modern reader, an ironic ring. The priests' knowledge of Judaism was as sound as their sources, a circumstance which, together with their personal prejudices, accounts for the intensity of their anti-Jewish virulence. If European anti-Semitism had lost none of its strength in the seventeenth century, one would scarcely be justified in singling out the Portuguese clergy as propagators of a fanatic racialism. But precisely in this period the long overdue reaction against intolerance sets in and the philo Semitic stand of Protestant hebraists prepares European public opinion for the changes in the status of the Jews which, a century later, culminate in their emancipation.294 For the admirer of Lusitanian culture it is disheartening to see that Portugal remained at the margin of this humanitarian movement. While other countries strove to undo the wrongs of centuries of oppression, Portugal, turning away from toleration, wrote new and glowing chapters for an apotheosis of the Inquisition. This determined adherence to discarded values — a partial manifestation of a national decadence — finds impassioned expression in the anti-Semitic rantings of the Portuguese clergy. נ" Diccionario Bibliographie() Portuguez (Lisboa, 1858), I, 4.
