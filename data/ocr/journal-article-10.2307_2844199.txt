<plain_text><page sequence="1">29 THE SPIRITS OF THE DE AD IN SAULTEAUX LIFE AND THOUGHT By A. IRVING HALLOWELL, PH.D. I. INTRODUCTION Aboriginal beliefs in the reality of a life beyond the grave cannot be viewed as simple dogmas that gain currency without any appeal to observation and experience. In the case of the Berens River Saulteaux,' they are supported by the testimony of individuals who are said to have travelled beyond the bourne and returned to tell their fellows about it; by the testimony of those who have approached the land of the dead in dreams; by the resurrection, or resuscitation, of persons reputed to be dead; by the invocation of the spirits of the dead in the conjuring lodge, and in other ways. The individuals who are said to have visited dj baidkipg,2 the spirit (ghost) land,3 are usually persons believed to be dead, or thought to be fatally ill. To the outsider it seems more likely, of course, that the former were not actually dead, and we would be inclined to say that in both types of cases the individuals dreamed that they made the journey to djibaia1kcig. But the Saulteaux do not phrase things in this manner. Despite the fact that in native theory the soul (otcatcakwin), detached from the body, makes the journey in any case, and that dream experiences are classified as " real " experiences, categorically continuous with those of the waking life, a purely empirical distinction is made. The experiences described by persons observed to be dead, or fatally ill, are not said to have been " dreamed ", while the " experiences " described by healthy persons are said to have been dreamed. The distinction is based on the direct observation of the bodily condition of the persons involved. In the former cases it is coma, or illness, that lends support to their testimony. So far as I understand the matter, while healthy persons may dream of the dead, or even approach djibaidkigg, their souls do not ordinarily visit this land of the dead. To do so is very dangerous, if one wishes to return to the land of the living; so only persons with extraordinary spiritual powers could achieve the journey. One such case will be referred to below. From the Saulteaux point of view, at any rate, Bevan (1928, pp. 42 ff.) certainly errs when he unequivocally states that, with the exception of Saint Paul, "there is no single instance 1 These are a hunting people of Ojibwa derivation, some 900 in number, living in the forested region east of Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The author spent six summers with them (beginning in 1932). 2 Phonetic Nlote: * is long ; a as ' a ' in ' bat '; oc as ' u ' in ' but '. 3 See Conard (1900, pp. 43 ff.), where references to visits to the land of the dead, culled from the older sources, are given. See also Jones (1919).</page><page sequence="2">30 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought given us of a man visiting the spirit-world which is not either mythological or literary fiction" (p. 62). It is also curious that he does not mention Swedenborg. Of course, he is thinking primarily of classical antiquity, of Odysseus, of Plato's Er the Pamphylian and, in later times, of Dante. Apparently Bevan thinks that the " widely diffused idea amongst primitive peoples that a man might go or be carried into the spirit world and come back to tell what he had found " belongs to the same general category. Among the Saulteaux, at least, it is otherwise. Specific individuals are referred to, whose historicity is not in question, however one may choose to evaluate their testimony. When I made inquiries about life after death, it was the alleged experiences of these individuals that were first mentioned. I was not given generalized statements.' Once it is recognized that such reputed experiences need not be true, in any absolute sense, but may yet be accepted as genuine by those who share the cultural tradition which gives them reality, it is possible to penetrate beneath the surface of native beliefs, and to understand how they function in Saulteaux life. II. ACCOUNTS BY TRAVELLERS RETURNED FROM THE LAND OF THE DEAD The following narrative of a human being's visit to djtbatdkigg is said to have been repeated more than once by Nocbagabek (Flat-Stone). One of his hearers gave me the account the first time I inquired about life after death. According to him, Nocbagabek had said: I saw a man who died and lay dead for two days. He told me what had happened to him. He never felt any pain. He thought he was going to sleep. Then, " all of a sudden," he said, II I found myself walking on a good road. I followed this road.2 On it I came to a wigwam. I saw an old man there. He spoke to me. 'Where are you going ? ' he asked me. I told him, 'I'm going this way.' ' You better stop and have something to eat,' he said. I told him I was not hungry, and started off again. He came along with me. 'I'll show you where your parents are staying,' he said. While we were walking we came in sight of lots of wigwams. As far as I could see, there were wigwams. The old man pointed one of them out to me. 'You go there,' he said, 'that's where your mother and father live.' " So I went there. I found my father in the wigwam. He shook hands with me and kissed me. My mother was not there. Soon she came in, and greeted me in the same way. My father called out, ' Our son is here ! ' After that a lot of people came in to see me. They asked about people on this earth. They wanted to know whether their friends were well. I told them that they were not sick. Then I was offered something to eat. 1 Consequently, there is often no categorical distinction that can be drawn between alleged personal experiences and the more highly formalized narrative on the same theme, ordinarily classified as a myth. Gayton (1935) points out, for example, that such a journey is invariably described as an historic event among certain California tribes (p. 269), and that there, as elsewhere, versions of this myth, or related tales about visits to the after-world by human beings, form the basis of tribal beliefs concerning life after death. A Fox account, for example, is " given as a personal experience of the informant's grandfather " (p. 275); "supposed actual visits to the land of the dead are not uncommon or unnatural experiences in the Plains" (p. 277); and " on the Northwest Coast tales which deal with pursuit or resuscitation of the dead are common. Beside these there are experiences described by persons who believed that they had visited the land of the dead while unconscious or ' dead'" (p. 280). See Conard (1900, pp. 48-49). 2 dj'ibaci i1kcna, " spirit (ghost) road ".</page><page sequence="3">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-TIhe Spirits of the Dead in Sautteaux Life and Thought 31 But I could not eat.1 Some of these people that came to visit me had moss growing on their foreheads. They died so long ago. " While I was talking, I heard three or four beats of a drumstick. They were very faint, I just barely heard them, they were so far away.2 All of a sudden I thought about coming back. I thought of my children I had left behind. I went outside the wigwam without telling my parents. I started back along the same road I had followed before. When I came to the old man's wigwam he was not there. I kept on walking along the road. Then I thought I heard someone calling me. I could hardly hear the voice and I could not recognize who it was. Finally the voice became plainer. I knew that I was getting nearer then. When I got still closer, I could hear my wife and children crying. Then I lost my senses. I could not hear anything more. " When I opened my eyes and came to my senses it was daylight. But even daylight here is not so bright as it is in the country I had visited. I had been lying for two days. But I had travelled a long distance in that length of time. It is not right to cry too much for our friends, because they are in a good place. They are well off there. So I'm going to tell everybody not to.be scared about dying." Another man, Cafuwocniis (One Who Travels with the South Wind), was once very ill, and was expected to die. But he recovered. Later he said3: " I got pretty close to djlbaidkitgg. I was on the road there ". He said there were lots of strawberries on the way, and one enormous strawberry4 just this side of the town (6dena5). He could see the chunks that had been scooped out of it by passers-by. As he approached the town he could hear the voices of people shouting and laughing. But someone met him on the road and ordered him back. "You're not wanted yet ", he was told. Caiuwocnas said he got close enough to the town, however, to recognize one individual whom-he knew. This was Pi'kotcYs (Sand-Fly), who had been talked about a great deal because he had once eaten human flesh.6 III. APPROACH TO THE LAND OF THE DEAD IN A DREAM In the following account of a dream experience, the soul of the narrator travelled an even shorter distance towards the land of the dead. I was sick. I dreamed that I saw a road-not a very good one-and I started to walk along it. I could see my body lying there as I left. When I had travelled along this road for some distance I came to a rocky 1 This point has a significance which I did not grasp at the time. In an Ojibwa account of a similar journey (Jones 1919, p. 11), a youth visiting the land of the dead is offered their " supremely selected food " decayed (i.e., phosphorescent) wood-by his grandmother. When he refused it she said: " Naturally you are not yet truly dead. . . . When the time is at hand for you also to come here, then will you also want to eat this food of ours ". 2 This drumming was that of human beings on the earth. 3 To his brother's son, the father of my informant. 4 See Conard (1900, p. 77). 5 A term used for a large unit of population, and applied to the settlement occupied by the dead uy Ojibwa-speaking peoples generally. See Jones (1919, p. 9). 6 He belonged to the Poplar River Band.</page><page sequence="4">32 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought hill. A voice said to mel: "Can you see beyond this hill?" " No," I said. " Well, I'll show you what is there". Then I could see a beautiful country beyond the hill with a road through it. The grass and trees were all green, there were lots of flowers and it seemed very bright there. Then the voice spoke to me again: "Can you go there ? " I tried, but could not make it. The voice said: "You're not ready to go there yet. You must go back and prepare yourself " (that made me glad, I did not want to go yet). So the voice pointed out another road, that led back the way I had come, not the one I had travelled. I followed this road. Finally I reached the place where my body was. But in the place I lay was a big fire-I had to go through that2. Then I lost my senses, but woke up". Since I obtained this account directly from the dreamer, and discussed it with no one else, I do not know how the other Indians would evaluate it; but I believe that the illness of the dreamer would be a substantial factor in its validation. However, this man did not actually reach djibaidkiyg. Although I have not obtained any personal accounts of the journey of the soul of a perfectly healthy man to the land of the dead while he was asleep, in the case of 'resurrection', described in Section IV below, this seems to be substantially what is supposed to have occurred. IV. RESURRECTION Long ago, there was a man called Miskwa'desiwiskijik (Mud-Turtle's Eye). After being buried, he took up his earthly life again. His wife had visited his grave one day, and hearing a noise, had the grave dug up. She found her husband was alive. But he often acted strangely after this, as if he had not entirely detached himself from the spirit-world. Sometimes in the summer, when it was getting dark, Mud-Turtle's Eye would say: " It's just coming daylight. There is going to be a game of lacrosse". Then, instead of preparing for bed, he would dress himself and make ready to play the ball-game. As the night wore on and it got still darker he would make the motions of playing lacrosse, although he still remained in his wigwam. And he fell backwards all of a sudden and shouted, " the ball struck my forehead". He grabbed something and, sure enough, there in his hands was a rock, shaped like a ball. The implication is, of course, that this man was actually playing lacrosse with the spirits of the dead.3 The latter sleep during the day, and dance and play all night.4 There is likewise the well-known association of the Northern Lights with the playing and dancing of the deceased in djibaidkiyg. This is what makes their land so bright. Mud-Turtle's Eye is so well remembered, I may add, that a contemporary Indian bearing the same name is occasionally teased about being a lacrosse player, although this game itself has never been played on the Berens River in the memory of living individuals. 1 Informant indicated by a gesture that the voice came from near his head. 2A similar incident is found in the personal account of an Ojibwa (Gitche-gausin6) who dreamed he was journeying to the Land ot the Dead (Mckenney 1827, pp. 370-372). 3 Taking the account at its face value, one suspects a delusional state. That the man was suffering from some mental disorder is likewise suggested by another peculiarity in his behaviour which was mentioned. When he had to evacuate his bowels, he would not always leave the place where he happened to be, but would throw the fieces to one side with his hand. My interpreter commented that Mud-Turtle's Eye did not seem to have all his senses, after he " came back ", but that half of his mind had remained in the spirit world. 4See Jones (1919, p. 11).</page><page sequence="5">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 33 V. RESUSCITATION Closely allied to these cases are instances in which human intervention is said to have resulted in bringing the dead back to life. On account of the nature of the Saulteaux philosophy of the universe, and the acceptance of such testimony as that already cited, fetching the soul of a dead person from djibcidkiyg is by no means an impossibility. The case cited below was narrated quite casually to me, at the same time as a number of other 'cures', by the son of the 'doctor' credited with the achievement, and no special emphasis was laid upon it at the time; yet it does fall in the miracle class. Tricks performed in the Midew'iwin, however, were equally celebrated. This is not to say, of course, that bringing a person back to life was a common occurrence. Only the most powerful doctors ever did it. The point is that it is possible to do so, according to the Saulteaux theory of the nature of things, and in this case the individual concerned was not a legendary figure. Tcetcebuil was very ill. OtcibocmocsYs (Northern Barred Owl) was sent for. He found that it was too late to save her life. The day after he arrived where her father was encamped, she died. Otcibokmocss tied a piece of red yarn around the girl's wrist at once. Then she was dressed in her best clothes and laid out. " After this", said the narrator, " my father lay down alongside of her. He lay in this position for a long time. He kept very still; he did not move at all. Then he began to move ever so little. The girl began to move a little also. My father moved a little bit more. So did the girl. Finally my father raised himself into a sitting posture and at the same time the girl raised herself up in the same way". The native explanation of this objectively simple procedure is this. In order to bring the girl back to life, it was necessary for Otcibocmocsis to follow her soul along the road to djTbaid4kig and bring it back. Only a very powerful man would even attempt such a thing, but Otcibocmocsis was notable for his extraordinary powers. The yarn he tied about the girl's wrist was to enable him to identify her quickly, for no time could be lost. The journey to djTbaidkiyg does not take long. There are many, many people there, and if he had to make a search for her, it might have been too late to bring her soul back. By lying down beside the girl, Otcibomocsis symbolized the fact that he was making the journey with her. That is to say, his body lay there as hers did, but his otcatcakwin travelled the road to djibaidkiyg, too. Both returned to their " senses " together, since he found her soul easily and quickly in the land of the dead, thanks to the red yarn, and brought it back to animate her body. But, as the narrator commented, " he got her just in time ".2 It can easily be seen, from such case material as this, how relatively unelaborated are Saulteaux conceptions of life after death. But there are a few additional details that should be mentioned. 1 A nickname for which I could obtain no translation. 2 Jenness (1935, p. 110) records three un8sucemsful attempts to bring back the souls of deceased persons. Two of these attempts were made by his informant; one by the latter's father.</page><page sequence="6">34 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought VI. THE LOCATION OF THE LAND OF THE DEAD The general location of dj?baidkiyg is said to be in the south,1 and this may be the explanation of the north-south orientation of the body in the grave. The head is placed to the north, but the body is said to be " facing the south ". One old man, in talking about his " Drum Dance ", referred again and again to the " old people "(ket? dnicin4'bek) " down South ", and how much they enjoyed hearing the Indians " up here" beating the drum. He did not refer, of course, to the people of the United States, but to the Indians of previous generations who had " gone away ". Such references indicate, of course, the extreme ' provincialism' of the Indians, who retain their original conception of the world, as well as the functional value of their limited geographical knowledge, if the old beliefs are to be upheld. A more sophisticated- Indian once tried to explain that there were white people, and even " living " Indians, far to the south, but the old man did not find this account of things very intelligible. According to the aboriginal view, at any rate, djThbai'kig was not conceived to be above the earth,2 or below it, but in a distant region to the south. It was in this country that Indians whose souls left their bodies went on living, presumably for ever; and it was a land presumably richer in game and bird-life than the northern country, a place where no one had any trouble in making a living, although life was in other respects a duplication of this one.3 VII. THE ROAD TO THE LAND OF THE DEAD The " spirit (ghost) road ", djTbai ikcna, led to the land of the dead, but before one reached: the great town in which the djTbaiyak dwelt, there was a river to be crossed. This river is not mentioned in the accounts given above, but it is a common feature of Ojibwa belief4, and is also encountered among the Berens River Saulteaux. The current of this river is said to be very swift, and it has to be crossed on a bridge made of a single log. This log is very slippery, and sometimes people fall off. I was told by one man that the bones of such persons can be seen in the river. I could find no one who knew about the dogs guarding the road near this river, or about. the suspended line of shoulder-blades that has to be passed, according to the beliefs of other Ojibwa-speaking peoples.5 But the dog and shoulder-blades do appear in the myth recounting the adventures of Aasi. 1 Other Ojibwa peoples locate it in the West; see Conard (1900, p. 71). 2 The Christianized Indians use the term k'tc'giqjik, lit. '*great sky ', for 'Heaven', and k'tctg-jikoden- awan, lit. " great sky town (city) ", for 'Kingdom of Heaven' (or Heavenly City). 3 The Indian referred to above, however, maintained that there were no trees, and said that he supposed the djibaiyock needed no plants for medicine. 4 See Conard (1900, p. 77), and Jones (1919, p. 7). 6 See Jones (1919, p. 7). The word odinigocng, translated as " wild cucumber ", should, it seems to me,, be translated " shoulder-blade ".</page><page sequence="7">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dedd in Saulteacx Life and Thought 35 Because of the necessity of travelling the djibai ika.na (a journey of which a very realistic concept prevails), some of the pagan Saulteaux have, from time to time, asked their relatives not to bury them in a coffin-a practice which began, of course, under the influence of the Whites, but which is quite general now. These Indians believed that they would have to carry their coffin along the " spirit road " and across the river', and they refused to be burdened with it. They were quite satisfied to be buried in their best clothes, so that they would not be ashamed of their appearance when they reached dfibaidkiyg, and to be provided (in their graves) with a small kettle, an axe, a knife, and perhaps a gun; for it was formerly the custom to wrap the body of the deceased in a new blanket, and also to leave a little food at the grave. These articles were all, they felt, that a person required. VIII. GOD AND THE DEVIL IN THE AFTER LIFE So far as I could discover, the Supreme Being is not associated in any way with dj?baidkiVg, in the minds of the pagan Saulteaux. But there is a " boss " djibai, regarding whom more will be said later. Moreover, thougli Matci Mnitu2 was attributed to the level of aboriginal beliefs by several individuals, there was no associated belief in a 'hell'. In fact, the notion that eternal happiness or misery in the life after death is in any way dependent upon the conduct of one's life " here ", is derived from Christianity, even when held in a modified form. Since all of these Indians, even when professed pagans, are superficially acquainted with the general outlines of Christian doctrine, it is extremely difficult to establish the complete absence of any particular concept in aboriginal theology. Even when a man of advanced years, whose own father was the headman of the Midewiwin, maintains that, according to aboriginal beliefs, good people go to k'tcs manGnitu after death, and have plenty to eat and are well off, whereas " bad " people go to mn6tci man-ittu, where they are forever poor and miserable3 (although they do not suffer torment as in the orthodox Christian Hell), I think that one can hardly accept his testimony at its face value. It must be taken, rather, as evidence of the partial assimilation of Christian ideas, and the unconscious attribution of them to an aboriginal pattern of thought4. On the other hand, I believe that the genuine scepticism in regard to the Christian notion of Hell, which many contemporary Indians show, is to be accounted for, not only by the complete absence of this idea in their aboriginal culture, but by some 1Note the reference to the child who was buried in a cradle-board, and was laboriously making its way along the djTbai ilkcna, in Jones (1919, p. 5). 2 "Bad Spirit ", the contemporary term for the Devil. 3 "Bad " deeds, according to this informant, were those which injured other people without just cause: e.g., murder (including infanticide), sorcery, theft, and wife-beating (" if the woman does not deserve it " !). 4 I suspect that this process has been underestimated, particularly with reference to the moral and religious notions of peoples undergoing acculturation. I have the highest regard for the character and veracity of the man in question, and the statement quoted was of particular psychological interest because of the many details of aboriginal life and thought concerning which his statements were undoubtedly authoritative.</page><page sequence="8">36 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in -Saulteaux Life and Thought persistence of the positive notion, traditional with them, that the life after death is a happy one for everybody. Beliefs regarding the life after death, then, did not embody sanctions of any great importance with respect to man's daily conduct during life. Even today, fear of illness in this life is a controlling factor of much greater importance than any fear of unhappiness in the life after death. In former times, customs with a 'disease-sanction' were undoubtedly those followed with maximum stringency. With reference to the transitional character of the thought and customs of these Indians at the present day, I was told a " true " story which further documents aboriginal concepts, besides embodying the projection into the future life of the inferior social status the Indians occupy, with relation to the Whites, in the present one, and their sensitiveness to it: There was once an Indian boy, who lived at Lac Seul. He received a good education and became a teacher. After a while he became a preacher, a great preacher. Then he was taken ill. The doctors could not help him, and he died. He followed the " white man's road " to dj0baia1kirg, and came to a house. He knocked. The door was opened, but only a crack, by the person inside. A man spoke to him and said, 'You don't belong here on this road'. So he found another road and followed that. He came to another house. The door was opened only a little. He could not see inside, but he was told that he had better go back. Now this Indian was feeling pretty bad by this time. So he retraced his steps by the way he had come. He came all the way back and regained his senses again. But he did not take back his job. Now all the Indians in that part of the country are turning to the old Indian ways again (the narrator concluded). IX. OFFERINGS AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE LIVING AND THEE DEAD It is apparent from the beliefs quoted above that those contemporary Indians who still adhere to the native concepts of life after death, or even approximate to them, must feel much less remote from the spirits of the dead than do those who have more completely capitulated to Christian notions. If human beings have visited djtbaidkiyg and returned again, if a powerful doctor can follow the soul of a dead woman to the spirit world and bring it back to her dead body, and if Mud-Turtle's Eye could play lacrosse with the spirits of the dead, possible lines of communication are open, which more closely integrate the living with the dead than is conceivable from an orthodox Christian standpoint. This more intimate communication is evidenced in a number of ways. Not only is food placed in the grave-house at the time of burial, in order to provide the djtbai with nourishment for his journey, but it was formerly the custom (and it sometimes happens, up the River, even now) for relatives to place a little food at the grave from time to time, subsequent to burial. Of course, the graves of deceased Indians were much more scattered formerly than now, since when death occurred in the autumn and winter, individuals were buried wherever their relatives happened to be. Today there are cemeteries to be found near every summer settlement, and if the settlement includes resident missionaries, these burial grounds are under Christian control. But when an Indian paddling along some lake or river in the bush notices a grave, he will usually go ashore, especially if he knew the person buried there. If he finds some tea, tobacco,</page><page sequence="9">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 37 and food in the grave-house, he will help himself to just enough tea to make a cupful or two, enough tobacco for a couple of pipefuls, and enough food for a single meal. To drink tea, eat, and smoke at a grave is equivalent to having a visit with the dead. As one informant put it: " If the person had been alive and well, he would have offered these things to you, if you had come to his wigwam. Even after he is dead, it makes him glad that you should stop and visit him ". Thus by leaving food in the grave-house from time to time the relatives of the deceased not only maintain a certain relationship with him, but they enable the spirit of the deceased to continue the tradition of hospitality and the sharing of food, drink, and tobacco with others, that was customary to him during his life. Communication with the dead through the medium of food and tobacco is also carried out in another way. A little of both may be offered to the spirits of the dead by throwing them in the fire. This is often done, up the River, at the present day. It is unnecessary even to think of any particular person, nor need there be any special occasion for the food-offering. One informant said: Long ago there was an old man who went to djibaidki'qg. He found out that when a child died and its parents made a little birch-bark dish and put some food in it and placed it in the fire, the fire carried the gift to djibaia1killg, and the child told the " boss "l about what had come from its parents. Something is sent back to the parents-perhaps they wir live longer. But they are sure to receive some kind of " blessing ". It is because of what this old man saw, that living people make offerings to djibaiycxk. X. GHOSTS Since the spirits of the dead carry on their activities during the night, it is not surprising to find them occasionally wandering near their own graves, or in the bush. Sometimes one hears a whistle after dark, and it is most certainly a djtbai. The Indians seldom whistle, except as a means of attracting the attention of a hunting partner to an animal, when the voice might frighten it away. This abstention seems to be connected with the association of whistling with the spirits of the dead. When Chief Berens was a boy he used to whistle, but his grand- mother forbade him to do it after dark; and two of his children have been similarly cautioned by their mother. So far as tunes are concerned, such a practice would, indeed, be out of harmony with the way in which music functions in a conventional context, to say nothing of the personal property aspect of songs. Since the Berens River Saulteaux live at a latitude where the days are relatively short during the autumn and winter months, thus necessitating the carrying on of some activities in darkness, an intense fear of moving about, because of the possible presence of some djtbai, would be a severe handicap2. Graves and cemeteries are nevertheless avoided, if possible, after dark, but far out in the bush, it is not the spirits of the dead which occasion the most intense fear these Indians know, but possible encounters with wtndigowajk, cannibalistic monsters. 1 kadocbendoxyrg, " the master " (of the spirits of the dead), i.e., not the Supreme Being; see Conard (1900, p. 81). 2 One informant specifically said: " There is no reason to fear the dead ".</page><page sequence="10">38 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought Possibly the fact that when djibai have been seen, it has usually been in the neighbourhood of a grave, accounts for the avoidance of such spots. A man of the Berens River Band' once saw a djtbai near the graveyard of the Protestant Church. It was years ago, when he was a boy, and he was with five other lads. They had left a prayer meeting, and were on their way down to the river to skate. It was moonlight, and as they passed the cemetery they all noticed the figure of a man lurking there. They wondered who it could be, and it was suggested that perhaps he was after a girl. " Let's head him off ", someone said. They scattered and then closed in on him. They met no one, nor did they even find any tracks on the snow; yet there was no way for him to avoid meeting some of them. So it must have been a djTbai. Certain it is that whatever apprehension may be felt in meeting the dead in spectral form, the djibaiyxk are conceived to be interested in human aflairs and benevolently disposed towards the living, especially their kinsmen. XI. METEMPSYCHOSIS OF THE DECEASED Sometimes the spirits of the dead may visit their kinsmen in the form of a bird, according to one informant. An Indian may be grieving over a child. The djTbai knows its parents are very sad, and wil turn itself into a bird, and come back to pay them a visit. Often a person is almost able to touch one of these little birds, it is so tame. A bird seen hopping close to a camp may be a deceased relative.2 Once I lost a grand-daughter. One day I went out to set my nets. I had a sail on the boat. While I was sailing, a bird came and sat on top of the sail. I said to my boys: " Don't bother that bird. It means something ". The bird sat there a long time, as if it were visiting us while we were sailing. I told people about this, and the ones who had good sense believed me. XII. THE DEAD AS GUARDIAN SPIRITS Djtbaiycxk occasionally appear in dreams and even function as guardian spirits, that is, confer blessings. One instance is reputed to have occurred a long while ago, when native games were in full swing. A moccasin game had been played, and on the losing side was a man named Kekekos3. He had lost everything, even his shirt. Only his pants were left. He felt so bad, he did not even move from the place where he was sitting after the game was over. He lay down there and finally dropped asleep. In his dream he heard someone speaking to him. The voice asked him why he was so sad. He replied that he had been playing a game and lost. He did not know to whom he was talking, but the one that had spoken to him said: " I am djTbai. Now early to-morrow morning you must get the game started again "; and the djTbai told him exactly what to do. 'Living at the mouth of the River, where formal Christianization is now complete. 2 Usually, however, the approach of any wild animal is considered an ill omen. 3 This is a diminutive form of the term for " duck hawk ".</page><page sequence="11">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 39 So the next morning Kekek?s got all the losers together to make up his side, and the game was started. Those who had been the winners before now became the losers. The men on the side of Kekek's got back all the goods they had lost, and more. This was because the djibai had taught him what to do. People found out about it, and some of the old midewack said they could beat him, because they had medicine that would help them to win. But Kekek's played against them and beat them, too. The point to be noted here is the lack of identification of the djThbai mentioned with any particular human being; and the fact of the matter is that the concept of " owners " or " bosses " of all phenomena likewise applies to the spirits of the dead. Consequently it is the master of the djibaiyxk that is believed to function here as a guardian spirit. The implication is that Kekekos must have been blessed by this spirit in his youth. The same notion is the key to the role which the djfbaiycxk play in the Drum Dance of Kiwitc.1 This dance, like other ceremonies of its class, was a dream gift, and its performance provocative of blessings from superhuman sources. Kiwwitc was likewise the individual visited by a djThbai in bird-like form, and the one who told me the story about Kekekos, just related. While I did not obtain full details of his dream revelation,2 Kiwltc gave me sufficient information to permit certain conclusions: One morning the old wife3 spoke to me and said: " Do you know what I have been dreaming about?" " No ", I replied. " I dreamed about a drum in djibaia'k1ig. It seemed as if this drum was offered to us", she said. At the time I did not know what this dream of the old wife meant, but I was anxious to find out. Some time after this, I was lying on my bed when I heard someone speak to me. " Look.! " the voice said. And right in front of me I saw two things. They were empty coffins. Then I heard the voice again. It seemed to come from somewhere between the earth and the sky. It commanded me to go to a certain point. " I will meet you there ", it said. When I reached this place I saw four naked old men sitting there. (This place was between the earth and the sky.) At this point in his narrative, Kiwitc unrolled a small piece of birch-bark on which were drawn some animal figures, dots, and geometric devices, and indicated the point at which he had seen the empty coffins and met the old men. These were not drawn, however. "They came from the other end ", he said, " through here "-pointing to the centre line. Who were these old men, and whose voice was it that Kiwite heard? I think there can be no doubt that the latter was the voice of the Thunder Bird. The allusion to " between earth and sky " is in itself fairly conclusive, but even more so is the fact that, during part of the ceremony, two eagle-skins are attached to the south posts of the dancing ground. These represent pinesi, the Thunder Bird, and other allusions to this pawagan4 are usually made during the course of the ceremony. Thus the dream revelation is, in part, a blessing from prnes-. 1 A nickname for which I have no translation. 2 To impart which is strictly taboo. 3 A characteristic epithet, used regardless of age. ' Guardian spirit. In its literal sense, the word may be rendered as " dream visitor ".</page><page sequence="12">40 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought But what of the old men ? These, as I understand it, were representatives of what Kiwitc termed kcete ~anwcinabk, "old Indians" ('Ancients '). They are equivalent to djibaiyxk. With this identification in mind, we are brought back to his wife's dream of a drum in djibaitkiyg, and the coffins in his own dream. The connexion of the Thunder Bird and the spirits of the dead in a dream is not altogether an arbitrary one, since in the Saulteaux universe, pinesi comes from the South, and the country of the dead lies in the same direction. This emphasis on the South is objectified, to a certain extent, on the dance ground itself, which is delimited by a series of stakes laid out in a square, with openings (" doors ") left on the northern and southern sides. People enter the dance ground by the north " door ", and thus must face South as they do so: moreover, the exit after the ceremony is through the south " door This orientation is in contrast to the east-and-west orientation of the Wabano pavilions and, in former times, of the Midewiwin. The importance of the " old people down South ", as Kiwitc sometimes called them, of the kete 'anicinabek, and of the djTbaiycxk, becomes clearer by further reference to the bark. Pointing to the dots, Kiwitc said: These are the dwellings of human beings, but not those living today or yesterday. They lived long ago, when wlsakedjack was living here, too. In those days these Indians did not use the articles you see them using today. They made everything themselves. They got nothing from the white man. They lived just like the atsokdncdk ".1 On the bark, the dwellings of these ancients lay in the direction from which the old men came. One mayinfer, therefore,that these old men,whomi K;witc saw in his dream, were actually the spirits of deceased Indians-djibaiyock. He also saw the drum, which is likewise represented on the bark, and he said: " All the animals that you see drawn there spoke to me, even the ffies ". Now it has already been mentioned that the drumming of human beings can be heard in djTbaidkiyg, and that the spirits of the dead themselves sing, dance and drum. There is, then, a correspondence between human activities and those of the djibaiycdk. It is also believed that the latter are extremely pleased when they hear human beings drumming. Consequently the general setting, as well as the derivation and significance, of the Drum Dance of Kiwitc is intelligible. Djibaiycdk were among its spiritual sponsors; therefore, as Kiwitc remarked on another occasion about the drum he uses, " in a way the drum belongs to the old people down South ". A line in one of the songs used in the ceremony may also be noted2: djTbai 4gamegoyk kanimiti,k, " spirits of the dead wigwam where dancing is held." Finally, I believe that the importance of the spirits of the dead in the dream revelation of Kiwitc is supported by a conversation subsequent to his description of part of the revelation. He said: I went South in my dream. I was almost dead at the time I was telling you about. I saw all those people who died long ago and some that I knew myself. It was only when I came to my senses that I knew I was ' Anthropomorphic characters occurring in myths; of these wisockedjak is the most important. 2 A number of other songs allude to the Thunder Bird.</page><page sequence="13">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 41 living in this part of the world. It was also at this time that I was told I would have gray hair. As long as I live, I'll hold to what those old men told me. The drum used in the ceremony is called kimic4missa.nan, meaning "our grandfather ", a term which Kiwitc himself explained as due to the fact that it is one of the ' oldest' things known to the Indians. But since " grandfather " is commonly used, not only as a term of respect for any old man, but also in addressing, or referring to, spiritual helpers of all types, it has probably a deeper significance in this context. It is very striking that the djibaiyak, as conceived of in connection with this Drum Dance of Kiwitc, function as pawaganak. In the first place, they played an important role in his dream revelation; in the second place, there is the evidence of his own statement: " I ask in the wigwam' for blessings from our grandfathers2 down South for those of us here ". In 1934, when I first saw this ceremony, such a reference occurred in one of the first speeches that Kiwitc made. After the drum had been carried in and placed in the centre of the dance ground, the singers had taken their places north, south, east, and west of it, and Kiwhtc had circled the dance ground with his pipe, ceremonially pointing it in all the directions of the compass, he stopped south-east of the drum, and spoke. He referred to the beginning of the earth (a'ki) and the Indians (lanicinabek). He said: God (Manitu) was the creator and owner of everything, of all that we see growing. We must thank him for life (pinadocxziwin). He loves us and he will help us. Kiwitc also spoke of children as " the gift of God " (mdn'tu om4Tgwewin)3. Then he went on to say: I'm thinking of the Ancients who sat in your places (referring to the singers) long, long ago, before any of us were born. Now I'm speaking to them, the old people down South, who gave this (the drum and the dance) to us to use. WVe expect blessings from them, and from all the atsokanok4 in the North, South, East, and West. No one knew the names of all these until the old people named them for Us.5 Pingsi up there is watching us.6 We were told how to name him. I open my hand for a blessing. We are pitiable. God knows what we need. He will bless us with Life. After this speech, Kiwitc circled the dance-ground once, and went to his seat on the east side. 1 i.e., the ceremony. 2 Note the use of the kinship term in the sense referred to above. 3 Just how much these statements owe to Christian influence it is hard to say; but I would not wish to assert their complete aboriginality. K!witc also referred to " our friends who have come from such a long distance ", and expressed the hope that we would be taken care of and be given " Life ". '== pawadganak. 5 In a private conversation, Kiwitc once expressed naive amazement that all the plants, animals, etc., had names. 6 A specific illustration of the belief that the pawadganak are always imminent at such times.</page><page sequence="14">42 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought Later an equally definite grouping of the djibaiycdk and the pawaganak occurred. Taking a beaded tobacco-pouch in his hand, KNwite said: This tobacco was handed to me, but it is not for my own use.1 It is for those old people down South, kete' -anicindbek, and the altsokdnock.2 After I fill my pipe, one of them will circle around in the sky above to bless us, and he will also do some smoking. This latter reference, of course, is to the Thunder Bird. But 'the Ancients' and the pawaganak, as already observed, are expected to reciprocate, and Kiwi'tc went on to say: Some of the people here are not feeling well. But we have this great tree,3 and we shall take this tobacco as medicine4 and smoke it. Now you can go on and dance. The allusion here is to curative powers validated by the nature of the ceremony itself, and mediated to the human beings participating in it. It would thus appear that, in connection with this ceremony at least, any sharp distinction between human beings long since dead and the superhuman pawaganak has been obliterated. Both are objectives of sacrifice, and are looked upon as potential sources of blessings. Although the emphasis noted here might be the product of individual interpretation on the part of Kiwitc, I doubt whether this was the case. Here and there among Algonkian-speaking peoples elsewhere, the djTbaiycdk are found occasionally playing a comparable role.5 Perhaps the most striking generic parallel among an Ojibwa people is that reported by Alexander Henry (1809, pp. 130-1) in a description of a " feast to the dead ", at which the leader " called upon the names of his deceased relatives and friends, beseeching them to be present to assist him in the chase6 and to partake of the food which he had prepared for them ". XIII. INVOCATION OF DECEASED PERSONS IN THE CONJURING LODGE It is not so surprising, then, to find that, in the course of a conjuring performance, not only the master of the djTbaiyock may appear, but the spirits of deceased relatives of persons 1 i.e., it was a sacrifice, and therefore must be shared among the participants in the ceremony, and be smoked during the course of it. 2 = pawacganak. 3 This refers to an unpeeled, decorated birch tree, placed outside the southern boundary of the dance ground, on which sacrifices were hung. It is considered one of the " leading " trees, and it appeared in the dream of Kiwitc. It symbolizes, in this case, the medicinal properties of the plant world. There is a dreamed song, a gift of the birch tree, that is sung when the sacrifices are hung up. 4 In another speech, KYwitc also referred to the " medicine " he had asked me for, " to help us with a few mouthfuls ". This was flour, of which bannocks were made, and consumed by the participants. These commonplace things were sacramentalized through their use in the dance. 5 See Jenness (1935) for a reference to an annual Feast of the Dead, held in the autumn, before the Indians scattered to their hunting grounds; also Conard (1900, p. 64). 6 Italics mine.</page><page sequence="15">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 43 present may be invoked. While I was told that this was exceptional, an eye-witness' of one such seance gave me the following account: In the early fall (October) of the year when the War started (1914), I was camping at Sandy Bar. There were several other families from Berens River, and a Poplar River man, William Franklin. We were fishing. One evening, when some of us were sitting in his tent, William said: " I'd like to try something. I want to conjure before the snow falls, but the kind of trees I need for the lodge don't grow here ". "What kind of sticks do you want ? " I asked. " I'm going to take my fish to Berens River tomorrow ". "I want seven ojygubi watigok,2 and one or two green birch sticks, straight ones ", said William. So I agreed to cut the kind of trees he needed and bring them back with me. After I had returned the next day, two other men and myself put up the conjuring lodge. We started before dark, and it took us an hour or a little more. The same day another man and his family arrived from the Berens River Reserve. This man, Jacob Berens, was sickly, and when he found that William was going to conjure, he went to his tent and asked him to try and find out why the medicine he had taken did him no good.3 After sunset William came out of his dwelling. He had his coat on, and carried a blanket and pillow. He used the pillow to sit on while in the conjuring lodge. He went into the conjuring tent, and at once it began to shake. All the people, of course, were seated around it. Before he went in William called me to him and handed me some tobacco wrapped in a handkerchief.4 He said: " Give this to the people, give everyone a pipeful ". I did as he told me, and after he was inside I called to him and said I had some left. At this William replied: " That tobacco does not belong to me. It belongs to our grandfathers. Pass it to anyone that wants a smoke ". By this time the tent was shaking harder, and the pavaganak had started to come in. They named themselves and sang their songs. All the winds were there and, of course, milindik.5 There were also present memerigw4ci,6 pij?iu7, and many others. After a couple of hours someone came in singing very, very strongly. I heard William saying to it: " One -thing I was asked and I don't know the answer. You are one of those that sees many things. You can look around and tell me what I don't know." Then this pauacgan sang again, a very long song. It was the boss djhbai. Then this pawdgan spoke: " I -saw something a long, long way back. It's the old people's fault this man here8 is sick ". Then the boss -djTbai talked to Jacob Berens. D.: " How long have you been sick ? " J. B.: "Quite a long while ". D.: "Where are you sick ?" J. B.: "I'm always feeling pain around my waist. It is as if there were something drawing me together there D.: "Your father has something to do with this. If you like, I'll call him, and ask him to come in here ". 1Arthur Felix, a close friend of the man who did the conjuring. 2 A generic term for the evergreens. 3 The descriptNon of the conjuring performance is oriented with respect to this man's request, and is thus only a partial account of what took place. 4 The narrator was acting as skabe'wi8 (usher). 5 The Great Turtle. 6 A species of semi-human creature living in the rocks. 7 Lynx. 8 i.e., Jacob Berens.</page><page sequence="16">44 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought J. B. (half to himself): "I wonder if it can be so ".1 Then someone whispered to Jacob Berens: "It's all right. Go ahead ". So Berens said: " I'd like to hear my father ". The boss djTbai sang again. All at once, while this was going on, someone else came into the conjuring lodge. The singing stopped, and everyone sat very quiet. Then William spoke: " Here is the one you asked for. You can talk to him ", he said to Berens. The tent was shaking very gently now. J. B.: " Is that you, father ? " D.i: "Yes, my son ". J. B.: "Who are you with ? I D.!: " I'm with my grandchild. Ever since I left, I've always been happy. I've never been hungry. I've never been thirsty. I've never suffered any pain. It is a beautiful country where I am living. When I was alive, I always tried to do what was right. Try to do the same thing, my son; don't do any wrong to anyone. If there is ever anyone who says something bad to you, don't answer. That's the way I tried to act. If you act this way you will be glad. You'll see me someday, too. I see some people I know sitting outside. I see my oldest daughter ". Suddenly another voice, that of a child, came from the conjuring lodge. D.1i: " I see my mother sitting there. Don't do that, Mother! I don't like to see you do that " (the woman whose father and adopted daughter had appeared in the conjuring tent was crying ). " You hear my voice here. Well, I'll tell you something. I'm living in a good place. I'm happy. It is always bright like day where.I live. It is never dark. I was very sick that time, but now I'm not sick any longer. There are pretty flowers where I live, it's like a great garden. And there are lots of us. There are great singers there too. Don't forget what I am telling you. Live right and some day you'll find me Then the father of Jacob Berens spoke again. D.i: "Have you taken muich medicine for your sickness, my son ? " J. B.: "Yes, but it has not helped me ". D.!: " There was one time, my son, that I made a mistake. A man2 died and I dressed him for burial. I pulled his belt too tight. I pulled as hard as I could. That is what makes you sick now. That is the reason the medicine you have taken has not helped you. The medicine cannot work itself down into your body ". J. B.: " I hope I will get well now." D.!: "I My son, I hope you will. It's my fault that you have been so sick around your waist." Then William Franklin spoke again: " I don't know what kind of medicine to give this man tomorrow morning. Is there anyone here inside that has some medicine I can give this man ? " At this point, memerjgwe'd spoke up: " I'll give him a little," he said. W. F.: " You can give it to him tomorrow morning." M.: " No, I'll go and get it now." So he went out. J. B.: "I wonder how far he has to go." A pawacgan answered: "There is only one place to go." Someone in the audience: " Where is that ? " Pawacgan: "Memeqgweciwck live. at kicikcbiskan ('high rock') ". Soon the memeqgweci was back in the conjuring tent, and said to W. F.: " When morning comes, you give that Indian this medicine of mine I have brought you, and tell him how to use it." XIV. DRUM DIVINATION AND THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD Another method of communication between the living and the dead, one which has sprung up in recent years among the Berens River Saulteaux at the Pauingessi settlement, is apparently unique. I know of no specific analogies to it anywhere among Algonkian peoples. 1 The narrator commented here that it seemed as if Berens did not believe it could be true. 2 Not named.</page><page sequence="17">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 45 Despite the emphasis given to the role of the djTbaiycdk in the Drum Dance described above, when I mentioned to Kiwitc the ceremony I had witnessed at Pauingessi (in 1933), he said: " I have not gone that far." In the Pauingessi dance, the drum has become the medium of communication between the living and the spirits of the dead. This dance was a dream revelation to Namocwin (Fair Wind), now blind, and one of the oldest men on the River. For many years he has dominated a sector of the Grand Rapids Band, which has its summer fishing settlement and winter houses about twelve miles north of the other Grand Rapids settlement. Fair Wind has four married sons and one married daughter living there, and all his sons assist their father in carrying on both the Wabanowiwin and the dance in question. He is the ostensible leader of both of these ceremonies. The dance, like the one owned by Kiwitc, has no specific name; but my interpreter said that it might be called, simply, Djibaisi Mowin, " Ghost (or Spirit of the Dead) Dance It differs from the dance of Kwitc in that allusions to paw4ganak are absent. It is held within a pavilion, consisting of a circular structure made of poles,' which has four doors, facing North, South, East, and West. The northern door was used as entrance. On the occasion when I witnessed it, the dance followed a three-day Wabanowiwin. It was cloudy and windy, and a little rain fell in the morning. Preparatory to the performance, the ground inside the pavilion was swept out, some broken poles were repaired, and spruce boughs were cut by the women and placed both around the periphery of the interior, and in the middle, where the drummers sit. There was a flag-pole in the centre, from which a British flag flapped in the wind. T.he drum was brought in about noon, and a wind-break of canvas erected to one side of it. A fire was kindled outside the pavilion, to which the drum was later taken from time to time, to stretch the drum-skin. The drum was called " our grandfather ". The dance was opened by old Fair Wind, who with lighted pipe in hand (the stem pointing towards the drum), and his hat off, made some opening remarks. Then he circled the pavilion, took his place, and smoked for a while. Before the actual drumming started, he made a speech, in a voice which expressed deep feeling, and was punctuated by many gestures. The gist consisted in an explanation of how he obtained the dance. He spoke about one of his grandsons, who grew up to be a good-sized boy, and then fell sick. Ile said: I tried to cure him, but I found I was unable to help him. Others tried, too, but they also failed. Finally, he was so weak that he had to be fed with a spoon. Then one day he slept away. After that, even in the day-time it was dark to me. I was fuli of grief. One day I was away in the bush by myself. The tears were running down my cheeks all the time, thinking about this boy. I put down my gun and my mittens. I made up my mind to die. I lay down on the point of a rock, where I could be found. When I closed my eyes, towards the sky I saw something like a 1 I saw a similar pavilion in use at Poplar Narrows, farther up the River. The dance in this settlement was purchased from Fair Wind, but when I witnessed a performance there in 1932, no reference was made to dj&amp;baiycxk.</page><page sequence="18">46 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteacux Life and Thought nest.1 When I looked towards the east, I heard something saying: " This is something that will stop you from crying. You'll not die. For this is one of the finest things to play with." All this, of course, is typical of the situations in which many Eastern Woodland Indians, have received a 'blessing' from superhuman powers. They provoked pity, and they were given something to 'amuse ' themselves with. Fair Wind then went on to a homely human analogy in his speech. He said: If any of you heard one of your children crying, you would run to the child at once to find out what made him cry. He might have hurt himself, and you would try to give him something to amuse him, so he would stop crying. After a few more remarks that are irrelevant here, the drumming started. There were four drummers, two of them (Angus and WenoCtcEs2) sons of Fair Wind, and one of them his brother's son. Angus was the head drummer and sat on the south side of the drum. Not being aware at this time of the association of the djhbaiycjk with this dance, neither Chief Berens nor I paid any special attention to Angus, as he lightly tapped on the edge of the drum before they began to sing, and uttered a few words in a very low tone at the same time. We later discovered that these words were addressed to the djTbaiyck, whose medium of communication was the drum. After the drumming and dancing had been going on for some time, a new song was started, and a number of people, most of them women, appeared with dishes in their hands. These dishes were each covered with a handkerchief or small piece of cloth, and the women carried them into the pavilion, circled round the drum, and then deposited them beside the drum. Presently Fair Wind got up, and after making some remarks about God as the creator, who had delegated a little of his power to the atsokancxk, said: I'm going to explain to the great visiting Chief the meaning of those dishes that have just been brought in here, and are lying there with a little food in them.3 When a person has lost a brother, a child, or some other relative, we call upon them to look down upon US.4 They have been on this earth once, and before that they were sent from above to come on this earth. Jesus, too, came from above to be the boss of the earth. The food in the dishes, then, was being offered to the djTbaiycxk, and it is noteworthy that it was not 'the Ancients ' that the participants had in mind on this occasion, but the more recent dead, those that were still being mourned. Towards the close of the dance, the dishes of food were placed on the ground, arranged roughly in a ring around the drum; then the persons who had brought them in, while dancing also around the drum, took their respective dishes, and after circling around the dance path once or twice, placed them on top of the drum. The dishes were now unwrapped by the 1 The allusion here is to a drum. 2 A nickname for which I have no translation. 3 Sugared bannock. 4 This phraseology is significant because of subsequent references to Christian beliefs. Fair Wind was once a professing Christian, and had only obtained the revelation on which the dance is based a few years before this speech was made.</page><page sequence="19">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 47 drummers, and every person in the pavilion stepped forward and helped himself to the bannock. At this point, Angus made a speech. He said: My beloved friends, when I was a boy, I never expected to be sitting here beating this drum. Even when I was a young man, I never thought of it. Later, when I was a full-grown man, I worked hard on the York boats, just like my father had done. Yet I knew nothing. Even when I got married, I was still ignorant. Recently one of my brother's sons slept away. He is sleeping over there (pointing in the direction of the grave). I did not like to see his grave like that of an animal, all covered with snow. I went there and put my tent over the grave.' A few months later, I went north to hunt. I was crying, even while I was hunting. Finally, I made up my mind that I would rather sleep than live.2 Then I heard a voice saying to me: " I'll give you some- thing to ease your mind and that of others. But you must take care and carry things through as you are- told." Even a minister's name was mentioned. But the minister did not tell me half of what he should have told me. He did not even know what pineWs was. He is one of those that tries to make us believe that stones striking together makes the noise that we hear. I do not believe this. I mention it today because I know something different on account of what I have dreamed. Shortly after this, during one of the intervals between songs, Angus talked to the djTbaiycxk that were reputed to be speaking through the drum. This episode was not dramatized in any way. It seemed to occur quite spontan6ously. Because of its unexpectedness, as well as its unique character, my interpreter, Chief Berens, did not at first understand to whom Angus. was talking, or even what he was talking about. The words were uttered by Angus in a low tone, with his head partly bent over the drum, which he gave slowly-timed blows with his, drumstick at fairly regular intervals. It appears that Angus, while listening carefully to the drum, was at the same time repeating certain questions which were being asked, and then answering them. One of the questions he heard, for example, was repeated by him as: " The master (kadctb?ndcxjg) wants to know how we are getting along ". The answer given was: " Just the same as before. We are very poor." The reply to another question was: "You're merciful to the Indians. You know what they want--more Life, and the things we need for our bodies on this earth ". Once Angus called to his father and asked: " Did you understand what was said ? "No ", replied Fair Wind, " I was not listening closely enough ". Then Angus began to sing another song, but suddenly stopped. He evidently had heard something more, but did not quite catch it. At any rate he said: " I missed it. I didn't finish it." He asked his wife for some tobacco. She did not have any, so he told her to run and get some, and to be quick about it. This tobacco was then immediately thrown into the fire outside the pavilion, evidently as a sacrifice because of a mistake Angus had made. He 1 This indicates that no grave-house had been built, as was the custom in former times. Angus. was unconsciously reviving this old custom. 2 This repetition of his father's experience not only repeats a cultural pattern but must have a personal significance. The same mode of identification was noted in another instance.</page><page sequence="20">48 A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought said: " I've started singing now and I'll have to go on"; and he talked no more to the djibaiycdk. Soon there was the last dance, led by the wife of Angus. After going clockwise, the direction was reversed and the participants went counter-clockwise to the end of the dance. During this movement, Plkwakigan (Lump Breast), walking clockwise, wove in and out of the line of dancers. Then the drummers stood up, Fair Wind came forward, and the whole group sang a Christian hymn. Finally, Fair Wind lifted his hand in benediction, in the Christian manner, and Jesus was mentioned again. The exit was through the west door, where Fair Wind stood and shook hands with everyone as they went out. To some he said, " Good night ", in English; to others, the women in particular, he said, nypa (" sleep well "). When I later inquired whether the dance was a gift of the djibaiyc#k, or of some pa.w6gan, I was answered in the negative. It came directly from God. In this it contradicts, of course, one of the fundamental principles of even contemporary Saulteaux dream revelation. But the mixed character of the elements of the ceremony is obvious even in a superficial description. Moreover, the songs used are similar to, if not identical with, those employed in the ordinary potate dances, and these songs came from the Plains. Nevertheless this dance also illustrates extremely well how diverse strands of belief and praictice can be welded together under the influence of a strong personality, and yet still kept within the framework of thc Saulteaux interpretation of the universe. To my mind, in fact, the dance indicates the dynamic character of syncretic processes, and the fact that it is of fairly recent origin shows that there is still some religious vitality left in the non-Christian elements of the Indian population along the River. The unique features it embodies stamps it as a creative, rather than a decadent, product. There was one other practice, said to be associated with this Drum Dance, that should be mentioned. When a person dies, if his clothes or other belongings are sent to Pauingessi, it can be determined, by consulting the drum, to whom they should go. This custom is certainly derived from an older one, which consisted in sending the clothes of the deceased to some other settlement in exchange for similar articles, in order to avoid being reminded of the loved one. But Fair Wind and his sons send nothing in exchange; the articles are reputed to go to those who loved the deceased most. The drum is the medium of this information; and only Fair Wind and Angus, I may add, understand the messages which come through the drum. The fact should further be stressed that the curative function, associated with all the principal ceremonies of the Berens River people since the Midewiwin has died out, is a feature of the Drum Dance also. This is the aspect of it which I heard about at the Poplar Narrows settlement. Their drum was made for them under the direction of Fair Wind and his sons, and by the purchase of it' they have been able to share the benefits of the dream blessings of Fair Wind and Angus. 1 The price is reputed to have been so exorbitant that the payments are not yet finished.</page><page sequence="21">A. IRVING HALLOWELL-The Spirits of the Dead in Saulteaux Life and Thought 49 XV. OTHER CEREMONIAL INVOCATIONS OF THE DEAD The only emphasis upon the spirits of the dead comparable to that in the two dances described above, occurred in two ceremonies now extinct. One was formerly held farther north on the Poplar River. This dance was once described to Chief Berens by his grandmother; he was unable to recall all the details, but she called it Djibaisi Mowin, and stated that it was held once a year. It began after nightfall, and continued until daybreak. Eight or more carved wooden figures, painted black, and looking like human beings, were attached to a string and hung up in a row inside the wigwam. When the old man who was the owner of the dance drummed and sang, these figures would dance. They represented djtbaiyctk. During the course of the dance a whistling noise would be heard outside the wigwam, and it was the djtbhaiyck who were in this way characteristically indicating their presence. The second ceremony, held at Jack Head across the Lake, had become associated with the Wabanowiwin. It was called Djibai Wabano, and was said to have continued during ten nights. On the last night, the cabacndawan' in which the ceremony was being held was closed up tight. Only those who had dreamed of djibaiyock2 were allowed in. As the drumming and singing went on, djTbhaiyck were seen to pass through the cabandawan from end to end and then disappear. They did not walk on the ground, but " floated " along some little distance above it. After passing through, they were heard calling outside. Their call sounded like that of gulls. XVI. THE DJIBAIMIDEW1WIN CEREMONY There was, of course, formerly the Djibaimidewiwin on the Berens River itself, but this was of a character entirely distinct from that of the ceremonies already described. A living person was conducted through the ceremony, in place of a deceased relative who had already accumulated goods, and for whom all arrangements had been made with the leaders, but who had died before the spring came and the Midewiwin proper was given. Obviously these special circumstances in no way changed, indeed rather maintained, the emphasis of the fundamental ideology of the Midewiwin as ordinarily held; it was merely believed that the soul of the deceased person would be present. XVII. REINCARNATION Finally, a few words may be said about the belief in reincarnation. In this connection it will be necessary to return to Kiwitc once more. When he was telling me about his early life, he said: Some people say that a child knows nothing when it is born. Four nights before I was born I knew that I would be born. My mind was as clear when I was born as it is now. I saw my father and my mother, and I knew who they were. I knew the things an Indian uses, their names and what they were good for- The multiple family dwelling of former days. 2 This is further evidence, not only that the spirits of the dead functioned as guardian spirits, but that dream-visits from the djTbaiyock were not exceptional.

I used to tell this to my father and he replied: " Long ago the Indians used to be like that, but the ones that came after them were different." I have asked my children about this, but there is only one of them that remembers when he was in his mother's womb. People said to me: " You are one of those old people who died long ago and were born a second time." This last statement is certainly sufficient to indicate that a belief in the possibility of reincarnation is extant; but it remains almost wholly unelaborated. In the case of Kiwi'tc, it merges with the idea of precognition, the belief in which is stressed by making it one of the tokens of the possession of magical powers. It is this aspect of his account which is really significant. In terms of Saulteaux thought, the idea of reincarnation is in the nature of a secondary explanation of something remarkable. Thus Kiwitc, no doubt unconsciously, has invested himself with what, in Saulteaux opinion, is a sign of great spiritual power. Reincarnation is also cited when a child is found to have a few gray hairs. People will say that it is some old man or woman who has been born again (kete 4inicindbe e'ndjnicta6uwige But no identification is made with any particular individual, and the linkage with the spirit of the dead therefore remains extremely vague1. XVIII. CoNCLusIoNs Despite the emphasis given to the spirits of the dead in the ceremonies described, and the intimate relations which they are supposed to have with the living in many other respects, it is obvious that there is nothing that can be specifically characterized as ancestor-worship, or a cult of the dead. However, Saulteaux conceptions of the universe are of such a nature, and permit of so much flexibility in their concrete application as explanatory principles, that it is quite conceivable that discrete elements, now typically unelaborated, might, in the hands of some influential personality, be developed in that direction. As it is, the spirits of the dead, instead of being central in the ideology of the Indians, are actually peripheral to other spiritual beings, who are conceptually the dynamic forces of the universe, helping men to achieve the ends for which they strive. This relationship is demonstrated by the fact that the spirits of the dead tend to coalesce, in certain instances, with the pawaganak, conceptually and functionally. The gap is easily bridged, indeed, if for no other reason than the presence in mythology of anthropomorphic characters who themselves function as spiritual helpers; typical of such is wtscxkedjak. These anthropomorphic beings, while now immortal like the dead, once lived on earth like the Indians, so that they too are among the kete "anicinabek. Nor must it be forgotten how shadowy is the line, in Saulteaux thought, between 'human-ness ' and the essentially animate qualities of other orders of being. No wonder, then, that the spirits of the dead are such an integral part of the Saulteaux universe, and that they merge so intimately with other aspects of Saulteaux life and thought. 1 Subsequent investigation (1940) has revealed the belief that infants who cry constantly are trying to utter the name they bore in a previous existence, and that if this name is given them, they stop crying.</page><page sequence="23">A.
