New York: SUNY Press, 1993. In the field of Chinese studies, 1973 was a memorable year. A major archaeological discovery was made that caused great enthusiasm and Sinological fervor: the four "Silk Manuscripts of Huang-Lao" (Huang-Lao boshu) were unearthed from the Chinese soil. However, against the initial expectations and despite some preliminary discussions, the thought of Huang-Lao remained hidden in a tomb of intellectual obscurity. In philos- ophy, the real discovery was yet to be made. Randall Peerenboom's new book is a primeurin philosophical archae- ology in the Huang-Lao field. It not only combines the fruits of previous Sinological endeavor, but for the first time presents and defends a clearly delineated set of criteria for what Huang-Lao is. Here, I will first briefly outline the presentation: the criteria, content, and claims of the book. Second, I will, at greater length, discuss the author's defense of his central claim. 1. Criteria, Content, and Claims Criteria. Law and Morality in Ancient China is an obstinate quest for clarity. Discussions over the category 'Huang-Lao', not only before but also since the discovery of the Boshu, were often irritatingly vague. This is, according to Peerenboom, because of "the willingness on the part of contemporary scholars to appeal to it without first clearly delineating its conceptual content" (p. 3). He therefore begins by sharply distinguishing those criteria that will be presented as unique to Huang-Lao: foundational naturalism coupled with a natural-law theory. 'Naturalism', as stipulated by Peerenboom, means that humans are conceived of as part of nature and 'foundational' that the natural order serves as an unnegotiable foundation or norm for the construction of the human order. A corollary in the realm of jurisprudence is the promotion of 'natural law' in a strict foundational sense. First, as a 'rule of law', it is distinguished from the 'rule of man' in that not personal discretion but fixed law ought to be the basis for juridical decisions. Second, law is natural, which means inherently moral, as opposed to conventional or positive. Third, human law is grounded in and modeled on the natural order. The inherent objective laws of the natural order are 'transcendent' with respect to human laws in that the latter need the former to be fully analyzed and Lecturer, Faculty of Philosophy and Letters Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 44, Number 2 April 1994 347-385 ? 1994 by University of Hawaii Press 347</page><page sequence="2">explained, while the reverse is not true.' Internal coherence of the juridi- cal system is, at best, the welcome result of perfect correspondence with this predetermined natural order. Peerenboom goes into much finer distinctions than presented here. One may have reservations about this Cartesian demand for perfect clarity and strictly demarcated definitive criteria. Considering that a cer- tain degree of obscurity has probably always characterized the category 'Huang-Lao', one may consider the search for a variable set of family resemblances, differences, and analogies more justified. But, justified or not, it is because of Peerenboom's relentless pursuit of clear criteria that Huang-Lao thought is finally brought to daylight on the Western field of Chinese philosophy. Philosophy East &amp; West Content. The content of Law and Morality in Ancient China ranges over the whole field of classical Chinese philosophy, with the Huang-Lao boshu as its focus. Because methodologically, "an interpretation gains credibility by virtue of its scope" and, like a scientific hypothesis, "must account for the data," the book offers a discussion of the text in the broadest strokes, showing "how interpreting Huang-Lao as foundational naturalism not only saves the immediate text but makes sense of and in the larger context" (p. 103). The second and third chapters of Peerenboom's book (hereafter referred to as 'Part I') concentrate on the Huang-Lao boshu as immediate text, in order to demonstrate that its metaphysics, epistemology, philoso- phy of language, and, most importantly, its social and political theory are best understood as foundational naturalism. Quotes, terminology, and images prove that in Huang-Lao metaphysics the 'natural order' (dao) is descriptively immanent and prescriptively 'transcendent'. On the one hand, humanity and nature form a triad, a harmonious unity. The objec- tive laws of the natural order, on the other hand, are conceptually prior and predetermined. Ideal human action is, conversely, described in terms of complete compliance in which one "merely instantiates a precon- figured pattern" (p. 33). I do injustice to the author by condensing two chapters full of subtle distinctions into these few lines, but the general picture is all too com- mon: we are presented with a Chinese variant of traditional mainstream Western thought. "Ironically, whereas the Boshu represents an aberration within the Chinese intellectual tradition and may be of considerable interest for that reason alone, it is in its broad contours all too common within the Western" (p. 265). The con-text comprises the rest of the book (hereafter referred to as 'Part II') and serves as a background claim to corroborate the interpreta- tion of Huang-Lao as an instance of foundational naturalism. The quote above shows how closely claims about Huang-Lao are related to claims 348</page><page sequence="3">about Chinese philosophy more broadly construed. That is to say, some readers would not consider the description of Huang-Lao in Part I as 'an aberration within the Chinese intellectual tradition' at all. The argument in Peerenboom's work is that this tradition is best described in terms of the 'aesthetic', 'pragmatic', and 'coherent' rather than the 'logical', 'foundational', and 'correspondent'.2 To show that an interpretation makes sense in the context is a double task: one must demonstrate its distinctiveness on the one hand and its relatedness on the other. In simple terms, 'foundationalism' distinguishes and 'naturalism' relates Huang-Lao from and to the majority of main- stream Chinese thought. As to the former, no other classical Chinese philosophers espouse a foundationalism. In fact, most of their thought is best characterized as foreign, or even opposed, to it. The "stark contrast" with Laozi in this respect merits special attention because of the "the pervasive reading of Laozi's dao as an absolute, predetermined metaphysical entity or order," according to Peerenboom a misreading of Daoism dating from Xunzi, with few exceptions since (pp. 188-189). More specifically, in the field of jurisdiction, Confucius, Laozi, and Zhuangzi, according to Peerenboom, promote the rule of man, not of law. Han Fei and Shang Yang promote the rule of positive, not natural, law. And Shen Dao's rule of natural law is not foundational. Moving closer to the intellectual cradle of the Boshu, Zou Yan, Shen Buhai and some of the Guanzi and Heguanzi chapters almost all share some but not all of the distinctively Huang-Lao criteria.3 What makes the Boshu writer unique is that he has "reworked [all these current ideas] in the light of his own philosophical beliefs, and created in the process a unique system of thought" (p. 242). The second part of the background claim is that foundational natu- ralism not only distinguishes Huang-Lao but also relates it to its context. As an organicism that encompasses both humans and nonhuman nature, Huang-Lao can, according to the author, be considered a variant of the tian ren he yi notion, and hence, despite its promotion of 'transcendent' laws, shares "the general character of Chinese thought as opposed to certain dualistic cosmologies which draw a sharp distinction between humans and non-human nature" (p. 295 n. 23). As for some more specific links with other trends of thought, Peeren- boom describes the relation with Confucianism as, most importantly, one of opposition: Huang-Lao is a reaction against the shortcomings of the Confucian rule of man. Han Feizi, secondly, not only shares with Huang- Lao a respect for the rule of law, but also a paternal concern for the people. He therefore does not deserve the standard portrayal of a Shang Yang-type harsh Legalist. Laozi, despite the 'stark contrast', has, of course, more in common than simply the 'Lao' in 'Huang-Lao': terms and images, Carine Defoort 349</page><page sequence="4">meditation-practices, and an epistemic certainty that goes with the dis- covery of the Way. More apt choices for Huang-Lao concurrents would be naturalist- correlative thinkers such as Zou Yan and Dong Zhongshu, and Legalist- administrative (xingming) philosophers such as Shen Dao, Shen Buhai, Guanzi, and Heguanzi. They constitute parts in a Chinese intellectual puzzle which for two millennia was incomplete. Now that the missing piece has been unearthed-first from the Chinese soil and second from academic obscurity-it is time to reconsider general claims about classi- cal Chinese thought. Philosophy East &amp; West Claims. Peerenboom presents his readers with a continuous string of challenging views. Two main claims, about text and context, execute an intriguing twist. Paradoxically, complete agreement about the text (Part I), if not combined with a basic agreement about the broader context (Part II), amounts to the sharpest possible disagreement with the author. Before Huang-Lao can even be discussed, there has to be some sort of agree- ment that the dominant trend in Chinese philosophy is anything but foundational. In Part II Peerenboom elaborates on some important insights which have challenged Western scholars since at least Marcel Granet's poignant characterization of Chinese thought as "Ni Dieu, ni Loi." Reflecting on this phrase, Needham has claimed that the Chinese have never thought in terms of 'laws of nature' because their tradition lacks the idea of a body of laws laid down by a transcendent God: "No lawgiver, no law." Accord- ing to him, Sinologists have unsuspectingly and without justification read the word 'law' into Chinese texts because the idea of 'laws of nature' is so unconsciously present in the European mind. A radical expansion of this line of thought has been presented by David Hall and Roger Ames, who argue that the vast majority of classical Chinese philosophy is stripped of its best argument when forced to make sense in terms of abstract principles or 'transcendent' norms, both heirs of a modern West- ern dualistic tradition.4 Peerenboom agrees in Part II with his predecessors that mainstream Chinese philosophy does not conceive of order in terms of 'laws of nature'-nor even of 'natural law' in a strict foundational sense- and that we should be careful not to read 'transcendent' principles into the texts. Many of his arguments and illustrations on this account are of an unprecedented clarity and persuasiveness, partly thanks to his extensive use of insights from the contemporary fields of philosophy and jurisdiction. A telling instance is Peerenboom's twofold discussion with Joseph Needham who, on the one hand, labels the Confucian li as 'natural law', "norms of behaviour universally considered moral,"5 and, on the other, 350</page><page sequence="5">attributes to the Daoists a way which "reminds us of the logos of Hera- cleitos of Ephesus, controlling the orderly process of change," an order among all beings "brought about by their following the internal neces- sities of their own natures."6 On both scores Needham's readings are, according to Part II, unconsciously 'transcendent'-and, as such, all too common misinterpretations. The reader who assumes that all (Chinese) philosophy expresses a correspondence with pure reality or with a universal, predetermined order, be it in the form of moral principles or an abstract logos, does well to start from Part II of Peerenboom's book. But then a second paradox emerges: although some basic agreement about the context is a necessary precondition for further discussion about the text, this can also present a major obstacle for the force of Peeren- boom's main thesis. While Part I adepts persist in reading undue 'tran- scendence' into Chinese thought, Part II enthusiasts, according to Peeren- boom, tend to take this insight too far, proclaiming that there is no 'transcendence' in ancient Chinese philosophy at all. Needham-again in the role of antagonist-had remarked that in the West, whenever a strong political unification was realized, God's reign, as a hypostatization, shifted from the exceptions in nature to its unvarying rules-the 'laws of nature'. That observation led him to won- der why this should "not have happened also in China, where even in the feudal period there was some degree of centralization, and far more after the unification of Chhin Shih Huang Ti?"7 The answer, Peerenboom contends, lies in the recently discovered manuscripts and his interpretation of them: no God, but Law! Precisely at this point in Chinese history, the Boshu writer conceived of 'natural law' and 'laws of nature' without recourse to a 'transcendent' Deity. Very consciously Peerenboom portrays Huang-Lao as an exception to the rule and a major countercurrent in the flow of Chinese intellectual history. Herein lies its value: "As a challenge to many textbook generalizations about the nature of Chinese thought, it forces one to rethink and qualify previously held views, and, in the process, to develop a greater apprecia- tion of the richness and diversity of thought in ancient China" (p. 6). 2. The Main Claim: Foundational Naturalism in Huang-Lao. 'Textbook generalizations' result from intellectual inertia. The ten- dency to explain everything systematically in one nice and simple inter- pretation is indeed very compelling. But even more compelling, I believe, are the assumptions which-maybe inevitably to a certain extent- accompany Western interpretations. Despite repeated caution by schol- ars such as Granet, Needham, and, recently, Hall and Ames-joined now by Peerenboom in Part II-the Western core keeps fighting back. "We have continued to take it for granted," Angus Graham remarks, Carine Defoort 351</page><page sequence="6">"that Heaven and the Way must share the transcendence of our own principles."8 Focusing on the main claim of the book, explicitly argued in Part I and further assumed in Part II, I will try to indicate how Peerenboom's work provides us with a battlefield between his ('aesthetic') insights and ('logi- cal') assumptions, rather than with a well-balanced reconsideration of previous 'textbook generalizations'. For me, the virtue of this book lies, more so than in the suggested balance, in the unprecedentedly clear confrontation between the two camps. After reading Law and Morality in Ancient China, one will, if still ascribing 'transcendent' principles to Chi- nese philosophers, at least do it, like Peerenboom in Part I, in a more conscious and careful manner. Huang-Lao seems to be a hybrid between Chinese and Western thought, an interesting case that forces one to explore the boundaries of both. My disagreement with Peerenboom is therefore infinitesimal but important: for me, Huang-Lao still falls within the parameters of main- stream Chinese thought. It is given its best argument if read as one more, admittedly marginal, expression of 'immanent' order, a nonfoundational naturalism. For Peerenboom, the 'transcendent' reading is most coherent, which relegates Huang-Lao, in textbook divisions, to the Western camp. The following discussion does not follow the order of the book precisely. Bypassing the 'text' (Part I) and 'context' (Part II), I steer directly toward the 'texture' of the argument, the implicit fibers of which the interpretation is woven. Although (or maybe rather because) not given a separate chapter, they dominate the whole. They pop up in obstinate repetitions, long footnotes, and impatient remarks. They provide us with a lively picture of the author in the process of thinking-the backstage of the book. 2.1. Text, Context, and Texture The 'text' is a tightly crafted argument. At this level, criticism is either pointless or impossible. Pointless, because, as long as 'transcendence' is left out of the picture, there is little to disagree with. Clearly, for Huang- Lao, nature is impersonal, constant, rule-governed, and normatively prior to humanity. As soon as 'transcendence' rears its head, the demonstration be- comes immune from protest and criticism impossible: the interpretation lies inevitably in the selection of quotes, the restoration of lost passages, and, most importantly, in the translation of terms. To give one example, Peerenboom exceptionally translates li, the veins or immanent pattern in things, as '(transcendent) principle' because the latter "fits well with the foundational character of Huang-Lao naturalism," referring to the "intrin- sic order or the predescribed Way," the "underlying structure" of nature Philosophy East &amp; West (p. 47).9 352</page><page sequence="7">The 'context' is almost as immune as the text. Any criticism is taken care of by the two necessary aspects of 'fitting a context': relating and distinguishing. I am convinced by Peerenboom, probably more than he is, that Huang-Lao, as a naturalism, relates well to its context: it can help to explain the naturalization of law, it shares a common ancestry with Dong Zhongshu, it lives further in the Late Han immortality practices, and it evidences a view similar to the Heguanzi, which is generally recognized as the Boshu's philosophical twin. The fact that Huang-Lao and the Boshu also distinguish themselves is trivial. The question is how-certainly not, I believe, as a foundationalism. As a naturalism committed to the notion of tian ren he yi, the Boshu distinguishes itself by promoting a particular version of it, but not the one suggested by Peerenboom in which humans merely instantiate neutrally discovered laws. But to argue this point, we have to go beyond the context, too. I therefore aim at the 'texture' of the interpretation. Fibers of a fabric cannot be neatly unraveled, but three threads running through this book and supporting an interpretation with which I disagree should be dis- cussed before anything else. The first repetitive complaint is about a serious plague raging among naturalists; the second concerns, more generally, the problem of linguistic overlap; and the third pleads for gathering the notions out from behind the conventional phrases. Whoever follows Peerenboom in his mission to cure Chinese philoso- phers and, more specifically, the Boshu author of a tenacious plague, to help him get clear on his own terms and to grasp the insights behind conventional phrases, will be rewarded with a most elegant interpreta- tion. But someone who is intrigued by this plague, by the linguistic overlap, and by the conventional phrases enjoys philosophy in a very different manner. The recalcitrance of classical Chinese texts to make sense 'clearly and distinctively' incites in some people a sympathy to cure, and in others a puzzlement to reexamine their own assumptions. The discussion here, almost embarrassingly Chinese, amounts to a criti- cism of attitude. 2.2. A Plague among Naturalists In his last book, The Disputers of the Tao, Angus Graham, while favoring Hall and Ames' general characterization of Chinese thought as radically immanent-that is, lacking the notion of 'transcendence' as stipulated by them-remarks that "even in the major philosophers" there is no sharp distinction between the concrete sky on the one hand and the abstract laws that govern it, on the other. Even where tian became very depersonalized, this paradigm shift did not occur.10 Graham may not have paid due attention to the recently discovered Huang-Lao boshu, since in Huang-Lao, Peerenboom claims, this distinction is made. The only problem is that its author did not manage to say it clearly. Carine Defoort 353</page><page sequence="8">A Solution to the Plague. "The problem, which plagues many naturalists, the author of the Boshu included, lies in the failure consistently to distin- guish between natural and nature as pertaining to the cosmic natural order as opposed to that part of the cosmic natural order which is non-human" (p. 28). Tian, besides indicating the 'sky' or the 'firmament', occasionally refers to the all-embracing cosmic natural order, and some- times stands only for a part of it: nonhuman nature, in contrast with the human-social realm (p. 28). In order to appreciate the attribution of 'transcendence' to the cos- mic natural order, one needs further to clarify an important distinction, which most naturalists fail to make, between its descriptive and prescrip- tive sense. While sometimes referring to the actually given order at any particular moment, tian (dao) also stands for the implicit, predetermined order the laws of which are to be discovered and abided by (p. 32). "In assessing the naturalism of the Boshu," Peerenboom warns the reader, "one does well to keep in mind this linguistic ambiguity and the possibility that it might signal conceptual equivocation on the part of the author" (p. 28; my italics). Once cured of the plague, Huang-Lao appears to be an interesting combination of immanence and 'transcendence'. Descriptively, human- ity is part of tian as 'the cosmic natural order': this accounts for 'natural- ism'; prescriptively, tian hides in its metaphysical Hinterland a 'transcen- dent' foundation, where, contra Needham, there "are 'laws of nature'. The natural order is regular and reliable and guided by constant norms" (p. 82). The fact that Chinese philosophers are unclear about some, accord- ing to us, importantly and radically different meanings of 'nature', is true and forms, rather than a plague, an intriguing given. It is quite natural, if not ultimately inevitable, for Western interpreters to force dualist catego- ries onto Chinese terms: where the author refers to tian as normatively prior and rule-governed, we naturally understand it prescriptively as an absolute and abstract principle of order. Otherwise, we translate it de- scriptively as the concrete sky, the weather, the day.... Western inter- preters have, a defaut de mieux, almost without exception read this familiar dichotomy into Chinese philosophy." A hybrid such as the Boshu very easily lures one into this habit. But the assurance with which Peeren- boom presents this old Western plague as a new and welcome cure to make sense of the Chinese text is baffling. Fitting the Context. The notion of 'transcendence' sets Huang-Lao apart from all other Chinese philosophers, for whom there is only one world with differing degrees of subtlety. "Heaven is the sky," Graham explains: "In the absence of any spirit/matter dichotomy, there are only degrees of substantiality; man's thoughts and feelings are less solid than his body, Philosophy East &amp; West but only as the sky is more tenuous than the earth below it."12 354</page><page sequence="9">One important implication of this radical immanence is that human impact, however minimal at times, is not utterly excluded from the very beginning by a notion of 'transcendence'. The person who is able to perceive and act at the very subtle level is capable of influencing the cosmic order tout court, not merely its descriptive layer. The Chinese confidence in human power over nature differs radically from its (seven- teenth-century) Western counterpart, where, paradoxically, the unshak- able belief in an unnegotiable underlying order-'laws of nature'-gives humanity unprecedented power over the actually given cosmos. But Huang-Lao, Peerenboom claims, is the exception. It promotes precisely that notion of unnegotiable law, and hence "contrasts sharply with the interactive, mutually determining tian ren he yi ... model that dominates much of Chinese thought" (p. 6). While the difference between the other classical Chinese philosophers lies in the degree of cosmic impact they allow to humanity and the importance they attribute to the mutual determination of sociocosmic order, Huang-Lao differs in kind. The Boshu writer generates a separation between humans and the cos- mological source of order which had yet to be thought of and which was immediately overcome after him. In the light of this claim, the immediate context into which Huang- Lao fits becomes very puzzling: it shares a common ancestry with such correlative thinkers as Dong Zhongshu and evolves into the immortality practices of the late Han, two trends which bring the intuition of mutual impact to its most extravagant implications. Even more surprising is the claim that the 'naturalization' of law in China can now finally be ex- plained. Derk Bodde "had discovered that, 'because the spheres of man and nature were thought of as forming a single continuum,' violations of law in the Chinese world represent not just transgressions of the human social order but disruptions of 'the total cosmic order"' (p. 5).13 In Peeren- boom's 'transcendent' interpretation, Huang-Lao would be unique in declaring this sort of human impact inconceivable. In my opinion, it is only if read on a continuum with mainstream Chinese philosophy that the Boshu can suggest an answer to these questions and help to explain the changing importance of human impact from a latent possibility in the Zhou dynasty to an explicit philosophical and political topic by the Han. Maybe the Text. As argued above, Peerenboom's notion of a mere- ly descriptive naturalism combined with a weak 'transcendence' is not very welcome as a cure in itself, nor as an elegant hypothesis to make sense of Huang-Lao in its broader context. There could, however, be something in the immediate text that forces one to postulate the pro- posed dichotomy. At first glance no such disjunction is apparent because the "relation- ship between the cosmic natural order, the human order, and the order Carine Defoort 355</page><page sequence="10">Philosophy East &amp; West of non-human nature is muddied" (p. 28) by the renowned plague. Peer- enboom therefore gives the author a hand. The Boshu is given its strongest argument when we make a distinction that it did not make and we introduce a notion of 'transcendence' that it failed to express. This failure becomes all the more intriguing because it is said to be the crux of the argument, the notion by which the Boshu distinguishes itself as a major countercurrent in the mainstream of Chinese thought. But if the author was not able to express his point, did he even think it? He never says that tian has two inexpressible, but importantly different, meanings. The only classical text in which one might find such a distinc- tion is perhaps the Heguanzi: What we call tian is not this so-called tian of azure qi.... What we call tian means that which, in making things as they are, does not overpower them in any way. (8.40-41)14 For Peerenboom, this statement shows that the author of the Heguanzi thought of tian as "an impersonal order, not simply the firmament" (p. 277). For Graham, too, this is the closest that classical Chinese thought comes to our dualism. Commenting on this line, he notices that the "Ho-kuan-tzu is exceptional among pre-Han texts in explicitly distinguish- ing Heaven and Earth from sky and soil," but, he continues, "What Heaven and Earth are not seems here to be rather clearer that what they are."15 The difference is one of attitude: Graham is intrigued; Peerenboom understanding. Graham, although tempted, does not attribute any dual- ism to Heguanzi because he believes that wouldn't fit text or context. He keeps wondering in what sort of world view a most obvious (according to us) distinction is still not made. Peerenboom, on the other hand, sympathizes with the plagued and confused author, and grants him his best 'clear and distinct' argument. Mainstream Naturalism: A Radical Immanentalism. Opposing, as a norm for action, 'objective reality' to 'the whim of the ruler', Peerenboom depicts the Huang-Lao ruler as "merely the medium through which the Way is translated into legislation" (p. 101). My disagreement is not only with this characterization of Huang-Lao thought, but also with the expan- sion of 'naturalism' to include a mere one-directional subordination of humanity to existing laws. As for the first objection, I do not claim, of course, that Huang-Lao promotes a rule of whims. This opposition between absolute certainty and extreme relativism is itself heir to a dualistic tradition unknown in ancient China. On the contrary, I would agree that in Huang-Lao active human impact is minimal. Although, under a bad ruler, the fa (standards/ laws) are bad, the ming (names/titles) get lost, and chaos prevails through- out the sociocosmic world, so that in extremo, "tian goes against its 356</page><page sequence="11">seasons" (2.14:35b),16 the ruler's responsibility is on the whole negative and conservative rather than positive and initiating. I even admit that, more than almost any other classical Chinese thinker, the author of the Boshu would have welcomed Peerenboom's concept of normative 'tran- scendence'. But the paradigm shift did not happen. It has been argued that tian originally referred to the group of ances- tral kings of Zhou, who were part of the royal family and state and, as such, kept a close relationship with their son, the ruler of the central states.17 From the early Zhou toward the Han, tians and rulers evolved and became, along with the scale of their realms, as unbiased and impersonal as the paterfamilias of a huge clan ideally is. This is, on the one hand, more personal than a scientific 'law of nature' but, on the other, less so than a whimsical or anthropomorphic god-a sharp dis- tinction which, I believe, was unthought of.18 Even in the Boshu, tian is not the 'transcendent' source of laws, but a concrete, impressive model with constant and reliable habits.19 Hu- mans, on the other hand, are not the neutral discoverers of a predeter- mined prescriptive order but, as part of the 'heavenly' family, co-genera- tors of order. Filial impact, however minimal at times, was never excluded by a notion of 'transcendence'. As for 'fitting the data' of the immediate text, the very first line of the Boshu provides an occasion for the interpretations to compete. The Jing fa begins with "dao sheng fa" (the way generates/grows laws/standards/ models), representing, according to Peerenboom, solid textual evidence for the existence of 'natural law'. One line further, however, we read: "the one who grasps the way, generating fa, does not dare to violate them" (1.1: 2a). For a scholar educated in 'textbook generalizations' about Chi- nese thought, this is a clear expression of a peculiar idea: the ruler taking part, however modest, in the cosmic process. For Peerenboom, it is, on the contrary, a confused statement of a clear and very common idea in the modern West: nature generates [prescriptively]; the ruler generates [descriptively] by instantiating the abstract laws from nature in concrete, political, and administrative laws. This is how far human impact goes. A broader context for this line is provided by the Heguanzi (14:96), where "dao sheng fa" is preceded by "sheng sheng dao" (the sage generates/grows the way). Far from an occasion to reconsider his 'tran- scendent' interpretation of Huang-Lao, Peerenboom remarks that this chapter is "dramatically at odds" with Huang-Lao thought because it portrays a sage who "is arguably the ultimate source of the way" (p. 279) ... more proof, hence, of the radical uniqueness of the Boshu. 2.3. Linguistic Overlap in Chinese Philosophy The difficulty "to state definitively the precise meaning of tian in a particular classical text" is only in part caused by the ambiguity men- tioned above. It is also due, according to Peerenboom, "perhaps in even Carine Defoort 357</page><page sequence="12">greater measure to the wide range of meaning of tian in the classical corpus" (p. 42). Not only do competing schools and authors use the same term in various incompatible meanings; a single author may even fail to remain loyal to one sense within one chapter or passage of the same text. Conversely, different Chinese terms, such as, for instance, tian and dao, tend to overlap in meaning, sometimes to the extent of becoming synonymous. This problem, which Peerenboom labels as 'linguistic overlap', be- longs, of course, to all languages: Law and Morality in Ancient China wouldn't have its length if terms such as 'naturalism' didn't have as many meanings as 'meaners'. But it is indeed interestingly different in Chinese: a tradition of commentators and respectful disciples tends to mask origi- nality, while in the West its claims have been much exaggerated. A symptom of this Western preference is Peerenboom's use of 'textbook' in a condescending tone. Dealing with 'Linguistic Overlap'. Peerenboom's diagnosis of the problem is very accurate, but there remains a wide range of attitudes available to cope with it. Burton Watson's stance is strict loyalty to the word. Consistently to render tian as 'Heaven(ly)', he realizes, forces an English uniformity on text and context, but it allows the reader to "judge the differences for himself."20 The coherence of the argument is one reason to retain a word-for-word rendering. Although the English translation may occasionally be puzzling, the text is allowed to speak for itself, and the reader to discover links which the translator may have missed or not explicitly stated. One is left with the charms and trouble of the relatively brute stuff. On the other extreme stands Peerenboom: even within one passage, tian is alternatively translated as 'nature', 'heaven', 'natural order'.... The fact that a term has a continuum of possible meanings in Chinese "does not prevent one from opting for the more specific reading when it fits the context better in light of one's overall reading of the text" (p. 300 n. 5). As a result, his translations are always elegant, fluently English in language and thought. The Boshu writer makes perfect sense. No illegitimate jumps are made from 'is' to 'ought', because this confusion has been taken care of in the charitable translation. The converse problem-overlapping meanings of different terms- seems even easier to solve. Contemporary debates concerning the pre- cise relationship between tian and dao in the field of Huang-Lao studies are held in a framework which, according to Peerenboom, is "not most illumining" (p. 55). Suffering from "inadequacy of terminology," they could be cured by the insight that, very often, tian and dao simply mean the same thing. "Tian (tiandao, tian zhi dao, tian di zhi dao) is used as a Philosophy East &amp; West synonym for dao, the natural order" (p. 54). 358</page><page sequence="13">In both cases, Peerenboom is loyal to the meaning, as he understands it, beyond and even despite the wording of the text. Not only do tian and dao, as we saw above, each have at least an inclusive and exclusive, prescriptive and descriptive meaning which the Boshu author failed to express clearly. We also learn now that the difference between the two terms is not relevant. To give the Boshu a fair reading, one has to determine where it doesn't distinguish and equivocate where it does. A Positive Evaluation of Ambiguity. An extreme loyalty to word-for-word translations is indeed doomed to fail. But this is no reason to opt for the other extreme. On the contrary, the failure itself provides one with fertile ground for generating fresh insights into Chinese as well as Western thought. Such is the attitude defended by Francois Jullien in his recent study on shi (position/purchase). Translators, he remarks, "usually compensate their imprecise understanding [of shi] with a footnote which merely calls attention to this polysemy, without further attributing any importance to it, as if we had merely to do with one of the many imprecisions of Chinese thought (insufficiently 'rigorous') which one has to get used to and live with."21 The Chinese polysemy of terms is at least in one way interestingly different. For Western philosophers, whose discussions often aim at a neutral description of reality as such (semantic truth), the stipulation of terminology usually belongs to the obscure periphery of the text- the notes, the index or the introduction. Chinese philosophy, however, focuses on the performative use of language, on how one impressively names something other than what it neutrally i.22 Contending claims on renaming range over a continuum between personal and impersonal, prescriptive or descriptive, powerful or vulgar ..., overlapping one another relatively rather than absolutely. Where Western scholars implicitly, and Peerenboom in Part I explicitly, under- stand tian as either an impersonal physical nature or a personal deity, either a prescriptive cosmic order or a descriptive concrete sky, the author of the Boshu has a host of meanings in mind, to which he, importantly, claims to add a more subtle one. With a farmer, the author of the Boshu would probably still chat about how nice tian is today while, at the other extreme, in a political context he would agree with Heguanzi that what he calls tian 'is not this azure qi', but 'what does not in any way overpower things', what is perfectly unbiased, reliable, and predictable in its movements-in short, the model which the advocates of Huang-Lao want to im-press upon their ruler. Instead of an absolutely perfect correspondence with some given or underlying reality, the philosophical claim concerns a relatively more subtle, coherent, efficient, fair, or styleful degree of naming. Chinese Carine Defoort 359</page><page sequence="14">philosophy, Huang-Lao included, is pervaded by this proud claim to subtle naming of what 'tian' importantly or efficiently-not 'essentially' -means. This provides a second consideration-besides the coherence of the argument-which prevents one from going lightly over the con- tinuum of meanings, opting freely for one of the many possible readings and changing whenever it seems to fit the overall reading better. 2.4. Fafon de Parler A last fiber to unravel from the texture of the argument is Peeren- boom's repeated claim that we gain a better understanding of the text by paying less attention to conventional phrases such as 'tian sending down disasters'. "The use of such metaphorical language need not entail an anthropomorphic world-view. It is nothing more than a fafon de parler. We gain a better understanding of the text by paying less attention to such conventional phrases and more to the notion of compliance and what this tells us about the Boshu's conception of nature and the natural order" (p. 43). Attention to metaphors and insight into their relevance is inevitably a matter of degree: some metaphors we find striking and convincing; others we dismiss as merely 'faFon de parler; and a third group, we hardly notice. Going over Peerenboom's attitude toward metaphors, I shall argue that more, rather than less, attention should be paid, not only to the original Chinese conventional phrases, but also to the English metaphors in which the translation and interpretation are cast. Metaphors. Peerenboom pays considerable attention to metaphors that portray tian as normative, prior, neutral, constant, and correct, while humans are, conversely, described in terms of following, complying, and adapting. As long as 'transcendence' is left out of the translation, as I have pointed out, there is little to disagree with. But even these privileged metaphors are far from "unambiguous statements as to the impersonal nature of nature" (p. 42; my italics). How could they possibly be, consider- ing the ambiguity and linguistic overlap plaguing terms like tian and dao? A second set of metaphors is problematic for Peerenboom. Several modern commentators have claimed that tian is an anthropomorphic heaven and that the Boshu even allows humans actively to determine their own way by overcoming tian. Their reading focuses on such state- ments as: When one transgresses the pole (ji) and fails to [accord], tian will send down calamities. When others forcefully overcome tian, carefully avoid them and do not confront them. When tian, in turn, overcomes the others, rely on it and join in. (1.2: 4b)23 The troublemakers are easily dealt with: these metaphors are "nothing Philosophy East &amp; West more than a fafon de parler," like "the mundane comments of people 360</page><page sequence="15">today that 'mother nature' is responsible for the latest natural disaster" (p. 43). Instead of suggesting how unconceivably 'Chinese'-read correla- tive-our own minds may have functioned not too long ago (and still do), for Peerenboom, contrarily, this analogy shows that the Boshu author is thinking of an almost post-Enlightenment type of scientific natural order. Tian's disasters are indeed not the doing of a personal deity, nor are they, I believe, "an entirely understandable and commonplace result" (pp. 42-43) of human interruption on the purely descriptive level. Even for a modern scientist, lost at night in the woods, with the heavens thundering above and a bad conscience within, I'm sure they still aren't. That such a clear distinction between nature and nurture, presently reigning in scien- tific laboratories as the model for human action, was absent from the ancient Chinese world view, should come as no surprise. Freeing the author of the Boshu from his conventional phrases, Peerenboom opts for abstract translations of concrete terms: tian (sky/ heaven) becomes 'natural/cosmic order', or 'nature' and ming (decree/ order) are rendered as 'determining conditions'. This is particularly curi- ous, considering the author's ascription of 'natural law' and 'laws of nature' to Huang-Lao. Only once in the Boshu is fa (law/standard) related to tian, a unique occasion for Peerenboom to consolidate his interpreta- tion of fa "as a possible functional equivalent of 'laws of nature'" (p. 48). The metaphorical context is, however, left unexploited. Where the text claims that the 'seven fa' are "how tian forms the ming of everything (tian suoyi wei wu ming ye)," Peerenboom translates: "the way in which nature constitutes the determinant conditions for the myriad things" (1.6: 12b). Instead of allowing the reader to wonder and discover what 'decree' means in a Chinese context, how tian could decree, where it differs from the Western political metaphor of 'laws of nature', and why it became so prevalent toward the Han, we are, instead, told again what ming refers to.24 Western Metaphors: An Underlying Realm. Instead of freeing the Chinese author from 'conventional phrases', Peerenboom merely replaces one type of metaphor by another. Doing so, he misses an occasion offered by the present intercultural confrontation to free himself from his own metaphors or, at least, to notice them and, if possible, to avoid them in translation. Aiming at the pure meaning behind the phrases, the imagery of a ruling and rotating tian is replaced by the Western background metaphor of two conceptually separate worlds: Huang-Lao is said to promote an 'underlying' structure, 'behind' the visible world, 'mirroring' objective reality. Peerenboom's interpretation and translations of the Huang-Lao boshu bulge with such metaphors, while the Chinese author doesn't use them. And this is, at the very least, a remarkable fact. Carine Defoort 361</page><page sequence="16">Where the Boshu tells the ruler to "join the pole of heaven and earth (yu tiandi tong ji)" (2.9: 31b) Peerenboom translates as 'identifying with the limits of the natural order' and finds in this statement an indication that a "harmonious coexistence is obtainable only if one follows the one prescribed Way that underlies the surface plurality" (p. 53; my italics).25 Not only is the dualistic world view that goes with the dichotomy that Peerenboom introduces absent in the Boshu, but also are its 'Western' implications: laws of nature and natural law. Only once in the four "Silk Manuscripts", as we saw, is fa related to tian. But nothing in the text, except Peerenboom's cure, suggests an interpretation of tian as a scientifically impersonal natural order. The Boshu writer himself was not inspired to any scientific exploration of 'laws of nature'. On the contrary, the stress on customs (su) pervades the Boshu and Huang-Lao thought. There was, moreover, no other interest in science during the Han than what naturally came along with the flour- ishing of correlative thinking. But in Law and Morality in Ancient China, the scenario is much more complex: Huang-Lao must have inspired a scientific interest in laws of nature during the Han. But as it fell from power with the reemergence of Confucianism, it disappeared as it was "reinterpreted in a more non-foundational, mutually determining, organ- ismic fashion" (p. 84). Nor does the Boshu give the ruler firm guidelines as to 'natural law'. According to Peerenboom, we "have observed many instances where social institutions are modeled on what is unambiguously nonhuman nature-punishments and rewards correspond to the seasons and so forth" (p. 70). I wonder what 'and so forth' may refer to. As far as I can tell, the Boshu writer hasn't discovered any more detailed laws than the constant pattern in seasons and constellations, the very Chinese intuition of a cosmic conversation-a 'courtesy' or 'administration' in Needham's terms-which the Huang-Lao ruler is supposed to entertain. English metaphors are misleading, not only for the readers of Peeren- boom's translation who do not know Chinese, but apparently for the translator, too. Where the Boshu promotes attitudes such as xu (tenuous), gong (unbiased), dang (appropriate/match), Peerenboom reads pure correspondence into the text: the ruler has to be devoid of subjective feelings and cultural contingencies in order freely to mirror pure reality, the 'one prescribed Way that underlies the surface plurality'. How could these images be understood differently? How do the Chinese, and the Boshu in particular, express priority and neutrality if not in terms of an underlying abstract realm? A Chinese Metaphor: The Political Pole. The Jesuits' fundamental misun- derstanding of Chinese astronomy, according to Needham, stemmed Philosophy East &amp; West from the fact that they failed to see that "Chinese astronomy was essen- 362</page><page sequence="17">tially polar and equatorial, depending largely on observations of the circumpolar stars." The attention to the pole was supported by a power- ful correlation, connecting the astronomical and political realms. For Needham, the Chinese alternative background image has far-reaching implications which, unless properly understood, lead modern Western scholars to a misunderstanding of Chinese philosophy similar to the Jesuit distortion of their astronomy. According to the Chinese alternative, "Im- perial majesty corresponded, not to a legislating creator, but to a polar star, the focal point of universal ever-moving pattern and harmony," radiating order out of the center like rain running along the spokes of an umbrella.26 Although implicitly characteristic for Chinese thought in general, in the world of philosophers the polar metaphor only became explicit and prevalent by the Han. Most impressive and enviable about the firmament above was its order and constancy, which contrasted sharply with the situation below. The heavenly firmament, expanding from the pole to the four seas, was 'ruled' by an invisible but extremely powerful axis: unique, upright, empty, balancing, overlooking, and unifying the whole by issuing a clear-cut network able to keep all variety in harmony. The most intimate link with this tian was its son, the emperor, who "embodied in himself (and, by extension, in his bureaucracy) that system of semi-magical relationships," which he was supposed "to maintain in good order."27 This is the ideal with which Huang-Lao advocates want to impress their ruler: vacuous and quiet, alone on top in the exact center, surrounded by a few capable ministers, overseeing the whole realm and making the world go around. While opposites proceed, he balances them out, and with a minimum of impact on the sprouting of things, he achieves a maximum of effect over the whole. Ideally, order proceeds from his "one saying" directed at the few ministers directly below, trans- mitted and divided by them among their subordinates, who, in turn, divide the job among their inferiors, and so on, down to the smallest fringes of the political dome (2.9: 30b-31a). A perfectly coherent adminis- trative network without overlap or gaps makes an unobstructed circula- tion possible: orders, punishments, and rewards flow downwards; infor- mation and achievements return to the political pole. The main task at every stage is therefore to fit perfectly with everything above and below. Rather than a pure correspondence with reality, a coherent network without blurs or excesses is aimed at. The ideal is not stated in terms of mirroring another realm, but of clear-cut division and perfect matching within the administrative web. Faults lie in obstruction, excess, and blur. The fertile obsession in Chinese philosophy is hence with the possibility of perfect and restless carving and with the uncarved center from which all division starts. Carine Defoort 363</page><page sequence="18">Like dualism in the West, the round world view implicitly prevails in Chinese philosophy and explicitly reigns in Han and Huang-Lao texts. One implication of the absence of unnegotiable laws of nature, as I have noted above, is the possibility for human impact on the order tout court. As a corollary in ethics, it is remarkable that the attention is not focused primarily on the absolute opposition between right and wrong that goes with a 'transcendent', prescriptive level, but rather on the scale of relative power from periphery to pole, where right and wrong become danger- ously intertwined. The power that augments as one's position draws nearer to the cosmopolitical center is a knife that cuts both ways: with a minimum of effort, a maximum of impact is accomplished; and from a small mistake, the whole firmament may go awry. Thus, in Huang-Lao politics, rewards as well as punishments increase as one ascends to the top. Those above who overflow, die; those below who overflow, are punished. (1.7:14b) The most evident scapegoat in the Huang-Lao firmament is the mouchen, the 'calculating minister'. Residing close to the ruler and acting with schemes on a barely perceivable level, he is both a danger and a necessity for every state. Rather than sticking to a given norm, he needs to cultivate a subtle and flexible feeling for what is right in the very particular context. Philosophy East &amp; West 3. Conclusion Part I and Part II form an intriguing unity. According to Peerenboom, the value of his presentation of Huang-Lao thought lies in the discovery of a counterexample to textbook generalizations. In order to read the Boshu as such a counterexample, one has to introduce a fundamental distinction where the text doesn't, equivocate where it distinguishes, and dismiss, neglect, or replace many of its metaphors. I do not argue that this approach is fundamentally wrong: we are all, to a certain degree, inevita- bly and even fruitfully parochial in our reading and understanding of others. But from the surgery the Boshu has to undergo through Peeren- boom's interpretation, I suggest the cost is too high. To counter Peerenboom's interpretation, it does not suffice to quote alternative passages, present different translations, or question separate claims. His argumentation is such a tightly woven masterpiece that one has to start by unraveling some dominant fibers and trace them through- out the texture in order to present an alternative interpretation in which, I believe, the author of the Boshu is taken somewhat more seriously. The presently suggested alternative has not yet been fully elaborated and probably will never present an interpretation of Huang-Lao as clear and confident as the one proposed in this book. 364</page><page sequence="19">The clarity and coherence of Peerenboom's argument, however, is, in my view-and this may be our most serious point of disagreement- built on fibers of nagging incoherencies. Despite his introduction of 'transcendence' in Huang-Lao as a major countercurrent in classical Chinese thought, the author tenaciously tries to include it under the labels which characterize ancient Chinese thought in general. Among these are 'immanence' (p. 309 n. 23), 'naturalism' or 'organicism' (p. 293 n. 1), tian ren he yi (p. 295 n. 23), and 'correlative thought' (p. 255). Such expansion of labels has an obfuscating rather than a clarifying effect. What does 'immanence' mean if not the exclusion of 'transcendence'? What does 'correlative thought' imply if not the absence of a non-relative realm? The crucial characteristic covered by these labels is that they exclude a relation with nature in which humans simply have to instantiate on a descriptive level what is prescriptively predetermined. Peerenboom's introduction of 'transcendence' makes Huang-Lao differ in kind from mainstream Chinese thought and only in degree from Western "dualistic cosmologies which draw a sharp distinction between humans and non- human nature" (p. 295 n. 23), despite his repeated claims to the contrary. These incoherencies in the latter part of the book do not at all diminish its value. On the contrary, they seem to be one more instance of the Chinese insight that order is born from chaos, a clear-cut network generated from an uncarved source-in other words, of incoherence and coherence forming complementary rather than mutually exclusive opposites. The great value of Peerenboom's work thus lies in the obsti- nate pursuit of coherence and in the intellectual rigor with which the author exposes many hitherto implicit assumptions, either to dismiss or to defend them. I would not be surprised if Law and Morality in Ancient China became a textbook for Huang-Lao studies. And this is definitely not meant in a pejorative sense. Notes 1- This stipulation of 'transcendence' is modeled after Peerenboom's (p. 31), which is, in turn, adapted from David Hall and Roger Ames, Thinking Through Confucius (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987), p. 13. Throughout this discussion, I will keep to this stipulation of the term, while referring to it between inverted commas. 2 - See pp. 33-37,105-117; Hall and Ames, Thinking Through Confucius, pp. 11-25, 131-138; Roger Ames, "Putting Te Back into Taoism," in Nature in Asian Traditions of Thought, ed. J. Baird Callicott and Roger Ames (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989), pp. 115- 121. The 'logical' order could be characterized as appealing to 'tran- Carine Defoort 365</page><page sequence="20">scendent' essences or principles-Platonic Forms, the Unmoved Mover, atoms in classical materialism, the modern rational or voli- tional ego, human nature, and so forth-for analyzing or explaining something, while the 'aesthetic' order is radically immanent in the sense that it completely lacks recourse to such 'transcendence'. 3 - Only chaps. 3-6 and 8-11 of the Heguanzi are said to promote a foundational naturalism a la Huang-Lao (pp. 276-283).

'Internal necessities' expresses an order which Peerenboom (pp. 37- 38, 83-84) labels as 'weak transcendence' and attibutes to Huang- Lao. I am not sure that this is what Needham has in mind. His occasional characterization of Chinese organicism in terms of a 'mysterious resonance' (p. 281), ordered by 'mutual courtesy' (p. 283), functioning as a 'bureaucratic administration' (p. 557), likened to a 'dance' (p. 302) and, most importantly, allowing a certain amount of 'play' (p. 567) occasionally suggests that the order Needham thought of resembles more the type of 'naturalism' conceived of by Peirce, and by Peerenboom (pp. 193-195) ascribed to the Laozi, rather than the 'foundational naturalism' he attributes to the Boshu. 7 - Needham, Science and Civilisation, vol. 2, p. 537. 8 - A.

In expressions such as siji and baji, it is difficult to stick to 'pole'.

According to Defoort, I have explained with unusual clarity the wrong text! Oh dear. How could this have happened? Apparently, by failing to take some of her preferred meta- phors seriously; by not translating or interpreting the metaphors I do take seriously according to her, rather than my, reading of the text; and, most importantly, by preferring a clear interpretation of the text to a "puzzled" one. To be sure, if Defoort is right in her reading of the text (context and texture included), then I have indeed not taken sufficiently seriously certain metaphors and have misinterpreted and, as a result, mistranslated many others. In particular, I would be mistaken at least with respect to one central issue: the transcendence of tian. Such a mistake would 368</page></plain_text>
