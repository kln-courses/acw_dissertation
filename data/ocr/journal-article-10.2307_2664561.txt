The subjects of the stories are varied, and include trogons, wood- quails, falcons, hummingbirds, flycatchers, kites and chachalacas. Anyone who is interested in these little-studied species will find a wealth of informa- tion about their natural history. The stories are also interesting because they provide insights about the author. Skutch tells of the endless hours he spent watching birds and nests. Indeed, the patience, at- tention to detail, and level of motivation required to gather the data for the stories are remarkable; Skutch's life-long dedication to observation could be a model for budding naturalists and scientists. On the other hand, his philosophical musings, which are sprinkled throughout the book and revealed in more depth in the Epilogue, may be disquieting to some readers because they include a heavy dose of anthropomorphism and "species bias." But whether you agree with these sentiments, the entertaining stories tell much about their subject species and the man who wrote them.
