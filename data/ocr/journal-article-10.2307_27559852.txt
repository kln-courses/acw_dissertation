<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Great Deep by James Hamilton-Paterson. Random House, 1992. $23.00 ISBN 0679405968. This extraordinary meditation on the watery part of the world has as its true subject all that is just beyond the grasp of human comprehension, understanding, and epistemology. Hamilton-Paterson, a self-styled observer in the great and lost tradi tion of nineteenth century amateur naturalists, appears on the ship Farnella on a voyage bound to doing the near-impossible?mapping the ocean floor in minute detail. He enjoys the "rare sensation for the layman in the twentieth century" of being present at the discovery of an unknown part of the earth's surface. Underneath Hamilton-Paterson's delight in the intricate procedures of sonar mapping is an equal and opposite desire to lose his bearings and arrive at a threshold of knowledge which leaves him lost again and adrift. Much of this book?which combines observation, history of science, ocean ography, social history, philosophy, and poetry?is a muted paean to the unfathomable, the kind of knowledge that the castaway Pip of Moby-Dick arrives at when he is pitched overboard during a whale chase?the wisdom and delight in being lost. Many of the wonderful accounts of oc?anographie theories are as witty and incisive in revealing the lurking ideologies of science as the best of Stephen Jay Gould. Like Melville's Ishmael, the narrator is constantly trying out new forms of epistemology in an attempt to grasp the ungraspable. The first two chapters are about names and boundaries which turn out to be little more than vain anthropomorphic projections of control and order on seas which hold no permanent delineations. Islands are viewed as elusive objects of desire, projections of the self, both "identity's apotheosis and vanishing point." Hamilton-Paterson moves deftly from examination of the theories of island formation and reef formation to anecdotes about national obsessions with preserving disappearing atolls as markers of territory. Always subtle and elegant, Hamilton-Paterson's metaphysical thoughts are intricately woven into bric-a-brac of science and history; his moralizing is muted and free from heavy-handed ecological preaching. Though the writing is cool and subtle, there are many striking, surprising, and bizarre moments. In an extended discussion of the theories of compression at great depths, Hamilton-Paterson mentions one William Stokes, a sailor who died in a deck accident on the nineteenth century research ship Challenger. According to records, Stokes's shipmates wondered whether his body after burial at sea would reach the bottom of the ocean or according to the prevailing theories of the day remain floating at a particular depth suited to its biological complexity. Hamilton-Paterson extrapolates on theories of the extreme pressure of water by a minute description of what would happen to Stokes's body, bit by bit, as he sank to the bottom. Brilliant as he is at illustrating numerous conflicting myths and theories about the nature of the sea and its properties, Hamilton-Paterson's darker purpose is to remind us of its terrible power and our littleness. Lurking behind the fascinating details of this book is a nomad narrator, lamenting loss and transience while celebrating the demiurge power of the sea behind it all. Robert Faggen</page></plain_text>
