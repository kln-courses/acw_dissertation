<plain_text><page sequence="1">Painted Rock Shelters of the Swat Valley Further Discoveries and New Hypotheses by Massimo Vidale and Luca M. Olivieri Introduction The painted rock shelters discussed in this report (namely Sargah-sar, Kakai kandao 1, and Dwolasmanai-patai) were found by one of the authors (M.V.), following the suggestions of Mr Akhtar Manir of the Italian Archaeological Mission to Pakistan and of local inhabitants, during the survey of the valley of the river Kandag, an affluent of the Swat (NWFP, Pakistan) (Fig. 1). This survey, carried out in autumn 2000, was meant to represent a first test for outlining a wider field project: an Archaeological Map of the Swat Valley (AMSV). The selection of the Kandag valley as a convenient test-area of a wider survey emerged from a suggestion by the second author of this report (L.M.O.), who had already surveyed the valley in the early 90s, during the field research on buddhist rock art (Filigenzi, forthcoming). Our goal is presently a GIS-based map that, following the indications provided to the Mission over many years by the deep insights of D. Faccenna, would organize and collect, in the future, the vast archive of discoveries, maps and field records created - although in an unsystematic fashion - during 50 years of Italian research in the region. The GIS environment of AMSV is currently being designed and preliminarily tested by S. Laurenza and S. Pornet, whose competence, and the help they gave in making the enclosed map, is hereby gratefully acknowledged. The Kandag (literally 'rocky') is a left-hand affluent of the Swat debouching into the main course in front of the natural stony elevation of Barikot (Bir-kot ghwandai) (*). Situated on the thick silty terraces rising on the left side at the mouth of its valley lies the extensive graveyard of the protohistoric site of Barikot (Tusa 1981). This ancient cemetery, before it was extensively plundered, represented one of the largest archaeological sites of Swat. In October 2000, during one month of intensive survey of the Kandag valley (about 13 km long and 2-3 km wide at its * The present article was written in parithetic collaboration by the two authors. O For the general topographic setting and archaeological context of the Barikot hill see Olivieri 2003. [1] 173</page><page sequence="2">maximum) no fewer than 83 sites were found. These sites range from clusters of lithic tools, presumably dating to the earliest periods of the sequence established by G. Stacul (1967, 1987), to protohistoric, early historic and later times (for early historical sites see also those referred to in Stein 1930 and Barger &amp; Wright 1942). One of the discoveries of this survey, as we shall see, is that the Kandag valley should be considered an important center of non-buddhist rock art, for both its paintings and carvings (see Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2003; Olivieri &amp; Vidale, forthcoming): in this light, the huge rock-carving site of Gogdara I (Brentjes 1977; Olivieri 1998) can no longer be considered as an isolated monument, justified by its location on a specific node of a major land route, but as a major expression of a much wider and more strongly established ideological and graphic sphere of behaviour. In our opinion, the new discoveries demonstrate that the rock paintings dated to the historic period, already known and published in this journal (Nazir Khan et al. 1995), are a later evolution of a tradition that could be considerably older. Also, we now think that while the rock art of Swat may be considered as a part of a wider sub-Himalayan sphere (2), it could also be viewed, at least at the present state of the research, as having its own features that differ somewhat from similar expressions in the neighbouring areas. Indeed, all the painted shelters we have so far encountered are (2) We mean the complex reality (even from a purely chronological viewpoint) of the rock art of the Upper Indus, thoroughly investigated at length by the research groups headed by K. Jettmar in the Northern Areas of Pakistan. These studies were for us a constant methodological reference; in particular, we searched for comparisons and coherence between the northern complexes and the Kandag figurations in the works published till the year 2000 (Jettmar 1982, 1985, 1989, 1992; Jettmar &amp; Thewalt 1985; Thewalt 1985; ANP 1, 2, 3; MANP 1, 2, 3). We limited the quotations of the Upper Indus complexes to particular cases that best fitted the overall interpretation pursued here. For the Upper Indus area, we also referred to the results obtained by the Japanese team headed by H. Tsuchiya (Tsuchiya 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996). For western and eastern Hindukush we also took into account the important synthesis by A. Desio, who deserves to be remembered as an important Italian innovator in this field since the days of the De Filippi expedition (1913-14), with Biasutti and Dainelli as participants (Desio 1985). The study of rock art often requires a substantial effort of comparing and quoting of designs, the graphic and semantic implications of which often do not depend strictly upon local stylistic variations. Referring to other figuration complexes in this light might appear a vast and painstaking task, but generic and incomplete at the same time. Here we shall propose specific comparisons, when referring to neighbouring regions (sub-Himalayan aereas: Karakorum, Hindukush, Ladakh, Middle Indus); more generic comparisons, when dealing with peripheral Eurasian regions (for example Siberia, Central Asia, Pamir, Altaic areas, Mongolia; for Tibet see Bellezza 1997, and 2002 in this volume); and semantic comparisons, taking into account faraway areas and other continents, while referring to possible recurrent meanings of single ideograms in the context of quite different cultures. As regards chronology, the authors in general share the viewpoints of E. Anati on the identification in rock art sequences of loose 'cultural phases' that, due to the probable long persistence of styles and themes, cannot be safely squeezed into narrow schematic chronologies. An eloquent example of the graphic expressions of Anati's 'evolved hunters-gatherers' comes from the site of Noh, near Yasin, between Gilgit and the Upper Chitral, where a boulder bears typical petroglyphs recurrent in the 'evolved hunters-gatherers' horizons, but precisely dated by the notation '1881' (Tsuchiya 1994: fig. 9). 174 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 - Sketch-map of the studied area showing the position of the sites.

In this respect, they probably represent the aesthetics and concepts of a well defined culture, distinguished by its own features; by comparing the paintings and the sites so far discovered, one gets the impression that a basic form of prehistoric/protohistoric art developed, in this part of the world, in the wake of historical continuity. Recording Waiting for the developments of the political crisis that beset Afghanistan in the fall of 2001 - a crisis that interrupted, at least for the time being, our field activities in Swat - the authors present a study of the figurations of three new painted rock shelters. The painted designs were recorded in the field by M.V. with the help of Akhtar Manir and our workers. In the three cases, the designs were recorded in the form of photographs and were contact-traced on to transparent plastic sheets (available at the local bazaars) using permanent markers, following the procedures indicated by Anati 1976 (Fig. 2). At Kakai-kandao 1 and Sargah-sar the designs were contact-traced in few hours, as the local security conditions were deemed unsatisfactory by our guides. In the Mission's house at Saidu Sharif the designs were 176 [4]</page><page sequence="5">carefully recomposed and reproduced on polyethylene sheets; this work was performed largely by our friend Francesco Martore, the draftsman of the Mission, who also provided M.V. with continuous information and technical advice. Without his help, it would most probably not have been possible to record the ancient paintings. The Sites: Topographical Features and Access The three painted shelters of Sargah-sar, Kakai-kandao 1 and Dwolasmanai-patai are very similar in location, in the material used for painting (bright red ochre), and, albeit with significant variations, present recurrent subjects and styles of rendering. Therefore, we will consider them, in this paper, as a relatively homogeneous group. Although the three sites necessitate closer and more detailed inspection, preliminary observation suggests that the rock shelters situated on bare eroded rock on the edge of steep sloping ground or ravines, are not associated with satisfactorily preserved archaeological deposits. One likely consequence is that their dating - a common scientific crux in the study of ancient rock art - will depend mostly on the study of the material culture portrayed in the designs themselves, on comparative stylistic considerations, and on the analysis of topographic contexts. The first two aspects will be dealt with at length in terms of methodology, as well as while by analyzing in detail each figuration complex. As far as the latter viewpoint is concerned, let us first consider some established points: 1. The three rock shelters rise approximately to the same absolute height, and on both sides of a major mountain pass. Although future research might obviously lead to new finds, it is hard to escape the impression that the reason for being of such dominant sites was related to the access to the pass or to its direct control by leading groups or individuals. 2. The three rock shelters are located far away from buddhist monasteries and stupas, and in general seem to have no clear spatial relationship with the buddhist cultual settlements of the valley. This is in contrast with what was previously reported for the other shelters of the Swat valley with historical paintings (3) (Nazir Khan et al. (3) Rock art finds, probably because of the climate in Swat and the nearby areas, are rare. Besides the quoted sites, we mention two sites we could not personally visit: the report made in 1993 by Mr G. Payr (Siran Forest Development Project) concerning the Siran valley (Hazara) in the caves of Seri mergul and Salabat; a report in 1999 concerning another rock shelter (Kafar-smast) near the village of Kukrai (Saidu Valley) (Badshah Sardar 2000: 184). The Chargul paintings (near Mardan) (Foucher 1942-47: 387-90, figs. 39-42), even if quite different from our finds, display pictographic elements that are so schematic and standardized that one gets the impression of dealing with a form of proto-writing, and it is hoped that they will attract the attention of a specialist (see Nazir Khan et al. 1995: n. 6). New paintings, recently discovered in Swabi and Mardan Districts (Shah Nazar Khan 1995; Nasim Khan 2000), seem to be strongly correlated to the paintings of the Kandag valley. [5] 177</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 3 - Sargah-sar: the paintings. (Drawings by F. Martore and M. Vidale).</page><page sequence="7">1995), all located in the vicinity of important sacred areas and stupas. Visible near the sites of Sargah-sar and Dwolasmanai-patai are slabs and boulders bearing clusters of badly worn cup-marks and linear grooves, belonging to a distinctive type of rock figuration complex frequently found in the Kandag area; in the same area and at Zerkanda-tangai (near Allahdan-dheri; see Olivieri 1998: n. 1; Bahadur Khan 1999: 6-7) (4) we found several other petroglyphs (zoomorphs and anthropomorphs; similar to the Hathiano-kandao examples; see above n. 18), whose dating is equally problematic (Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2003; Olivieri &amp; Vidale, forthcoming). 3. The three rock shelters rise as landmarks in dominant positions and are visible from a considerable distance, although the painted walls are only accessible by climbing; in the three cases the paintings had been traced, and had been observed, by individuals or very small groups, sitting or crouching (i.e. in positions we would consider, by European standards, uncomfortable). In one case (Dwolasmanai-patai) above the main shelter, on a separate boulder (Fig. 13), a secondary erosive cavity rises (about 200 cm long, 180 cm wide and with a height of about 40-50 cm) the ceiling of which was painted with other ochre-coloured designs. For both the painter and the visitors and onlookers access to the top of the cliff was quite difficult, then involving climbing down to the hole and painstakingly sliding in backwards, lying on their backs. In this way, the ceiling and the paintings could be observed from a distance of only 20 cm from the face, and only one painter or onlooker at a time would have been able to enter this narrow hole and observe the figures. A Description of the Sites: Sargah-sar (Fig. 3) The most important painted rock shelter was found on October 30, 2000 with the help of Jahanzeb Baccha, the owner of the land where the buddhist site of Gumbat lies, one of the best preserved buddhist cultual complexes of the Kandag valley (see Barger &amp; Wright 1941). M.V, after a walk of about one and half hour, climbed to the Kakai-kandao (mountain pass) to the left watershed of the Kandag, at 1200-1300 m above sea level. This kandao leads to the nearby parallel valley of Landakai. Then M.V proceeded down the other side of the mountain reaching a level of 1100-1200 m and remaining at the same absolute altitude. This side of the mountain had been watered, till recent times, by several springs that, at the time of the visit, appeared to have run dry. Some houses in the surroundings had been abandoned, after conflicts among local inhabitants. (4) As far as this carving is concerned, mention should be made of a peculiar misunderstanding. In the cited publication, dated 1999 (an important report, abounding in new and well documented information on the Malakand Agency area) the carving was reproduced with an inverted picture, and this might perhaps explain the interpretation of some animal figures as nagari characters.

The red ochre designs are mostly washed off, but they are still well visible in the left part of the cavity. (Dep. IsIAO L 1822072a; photo by M. Vidale). About 400 m to the south-west, the pathway leads to a major promontory crowned by a bare cliff, dominating the whole extension of the Landakai valley The basement of the Sargah-sar cliff is formed by a group of huge gneiss boulders that, also in this case, may be accessed only by climbing. The geological setting of this major landmark is formed by a series of thick slabs of fine-grained gneiss superimposed on top of each other, and projecting obliquely downhill and facing north-east. The main projecting slab has taken on a polygonal shape, with one main corner pointing upward. It has two round holes, about 35 cm in diameter, 10 to 15 cm deep, located symmetrically in the upper part of the slab (Fig. 4); and, at the base, a major natural cavity in the form of a pointed, inflected arch, measuring not less than 150 x 170 cm (the depth ranges from 15-20 cm) (Fig. 5). Remains of thinner parallel slabs, reduced by erosion to a large saddle-shaped feature, are visible in the lower part (Fig. 6). The space between the top of this boulder and the projecting slabs is restricted and there is not enough room to stand in front of the rock: the contact-tracing of the designs was performed, as in the previous case, in a sitting or kneeling position. The projecting side of the main slab [9] 181</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 6 - Sargah-sar: the stone slab with traces of colour. (Dep. IsIAO L 18220/1a; photo by M. Vidale). bears three erosive cavities that might have been perceived as having symbolic implications (see below). The surface of these erosive features is particularly smooth and lends itself to being painted. The surface is extensively deteriorated and covered by patches of lichen. A band of blackish incrustations departs from the top of the main slab, and descends towards the right, skirting the edge of one of the smaller cavities, on the right. Another blackish incrustation may be seen along the left edge of the main erosive niche, where it has covered or destroyed part of the surviving designs. Weathered gneiss in the Swat area is a often a comparatively soft rock; the natural decay due to heavy rainfall and to seasonal frost-heat cycles was probably further enhanced by the slashing and burning practices with which in the past the local forest had been continuously cleared for the purpose of enlarging the grazing plots. Frequent exposure to fire probably cracked and peeled the rocks, and covered them with soot. It is thus likely that these painted shelters were more numerous than those still observable (rapid deterioration was also noted after recurrent visits to the first four previously discovered painted shelters: see Nazir Khan et al. 1995:337). 182 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Painted designs or their surviving traces are currently visible mainly within the natural erosive cavities, in the first place, the one shaped like a pointed inflected arch. This natural niche must have attracted the attention of the ancient dwellers of the local valleys because of its peculiar shape. It is still extensively crowded with painted designs in various states of conservation: human figures, some of which carrying weapons, animals and elaborate geometric symbols are thickly clustered in a limited space. The designs in the upper round holes are poorly preserved. Other designs, almost completely washed away, had been painted outside, but are now reduced to faint traces (an archer on the face of the lower saddle-shaped slab, to the left of the main niche, and a group of dancers on the upper edge of the ?????&lt;*:. .?'???:i\:'.r.;--Z-:-r. ?????? \'r-^:: ??: ? ? ? ? Fig. 7 - Sargah-sar: a bowman (49). (Drawings by F. Martore and M. Vidale). same feature, see below) (Figs. 7-8). Thus, it seems likely that the slabs of Sargah sar were covered by a vast array of designs extending across the surface, even outside the natural erosive cavities, and that the surface of the rock underwent an extensive washing out process. It is important to note (see below) that at Sargah sar there were possibly two different, superimposed phases of painting, suggesting that the shelter had been decorated and visited for a long time (see below). Fig. 8 - Sargah-sar: the dancers (45-48). (Drawings by F Martore and M. Vidale). [ii] 183</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 9 - Kakai-kandao 1: the paintings. (Drawings by F. Martore and M. Vidale). At the very base of the main slab, as stated above, lies part of a smaller, naturally eroded parallel slab whose base, below the main niche, bears a saddle-shaped surface, with traces of mechanical impact and abrasion. This feature is doubtless artificial; its surface still bears solidified splashes of red ochre. This suggests that this odd stone was used for on the spot grinding and mixing of the red ochre used in painting. This artificial modification of the stone surface, clearly related to painting, is a unique feature of the Sargah-sar site. The main impression received from looking at Sargah-sar (Fig. 4) is that one is standing in front of a gigantic, supernatural face staring at the Landakai valley. The two round cavities in the upper part of the slab easily suggest the eyes, while the large arch-shaped cavity at the base looks like an open mouth. Other designs across the face possibly recall tattooes. Even the worn rock with remnants of the pigments used in painting (Fig. 6) could suggest a red tongue at the base of the mouth. The suggestion seems to be confirmed by the toponomy: sargah means 'the place of the 184 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 10 - Kakai-kandao 1: the paintings. (Photo by M. Vidale). head, or face', while the suffix -sat indicates any peak or hill top. These ideas might be just speculative, appealing hypotheses, but we shall return to them later. At any rate, more immediate information will be provided by a detailed analysis of each component of the painted figuration complexes. Kakai-kandao 1 (Fig. 9) Also this rock shelter was discovered as a result of information kindly provided by Jahanzeb Baccha. The rock shelter named Kakai-kandao 1 is found on the same path and at the same level, about 150 m from the upper kandao and the Kandag Landakai watershed. It lies below a small cliff formed by two oblique, parallel slabs of fine-grained gneiss, one projecting above the other and facing north-west, towards a steep slope (for the most important local lithotypes and their human exploitation in historical times, see Faccenna et al. 1993). The uppermost slab is about 45 cm thick; it rises in a dominant position, above a promontory (Fig. 2). At its center a small hemispherical cavity shaped by erosion opens, 15 cm deep and about 80 x 50 cm wide. The designs have survived only where the hemispherical cavity has protected the paint from rain wash-out, but the painted composition [13] 185</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 12 - Dwolasmanai-patai: Mr Akhtar Manir in front of the painted shelter. (Dep. IsIAO L 18221/27; photo by M. Vidale). seems to have extended outside as well; the original painted surface might well have measured around 2 sq. m (Fig. 10). Just above this cliff there now lies the flat yard of a farmhouse; some recent scratches and graffiti visible on the paintings (at the base and along the right side of the cavity) were probably scribbled by the children of the family. The original surface is covered by formations of dark-grey, green and silvery lichens. A band of blackish incrustations surrounds the upper margin of the hemispherical cavity, and descends vertically at the base. The face of the gneiss slab, on the right of the cavity, has undergone a severe and extensive process of peeling and crumbling of the original surface. The only way to view to the paintings (and to record them) is to climb around the oblique slabs with ones back to the ravine, crouching on hands and knees in a very precarious position (Fig. 2). The figures appear to have been traced, perhaps by fingers, with the same type of red ochre. Some figures still show well-preserved, bright red strokes. The designs form a crowded, vivid composition of animals, humans and geometric patterns that deserves a careful analysis. 186 [14]</page><page sequence="15">1 Fig. 11 - Dwolasmanai-patai: the paintings.

IsIAO L 18221/21; photo by M. Vidale). Dwolasmanai-patai {Yig. 11) This painted rock shelter was the last one to be found in the Kandag survey. We were accompanied to the site by Rahim Zada, the local land owner. The shelter of Dwolasmanai patai was identified in the valley of the Kandag itself, below the Kakai-kan dao and the Landakai watershed. The shelter is formed by a huge, squared gneiss boulder, on top of which rests a thick horizontal eroded slab of the same stone (Fig. 12). The slab faces south? east. As in the cases described above, the paintings were found inside a natural erosive cavity on the lower face of the uppermost slab. The cavity is about 15 cm deep, and has protected part of the original figuration from being completely washed out. In this case, even the inner surface of the cavity has been extensively damaged by run? off water. The surviving part is an elongated vertical patch measuring about 140 x 70 cm, bounded on the right by a thick blackish crust and decayed lichens, and on the left by the effects of an intensive peeling process that has removed all the original stone surface and exposed a powdery stone core. The surviving paintings display a complex, irregular geometric pattern on the left, and some humans carrying weapons or poles on the right; but, of the three shelters, this is definitely the worst preserved and the most difficult to interpret. The site also includes a second rock cavity located immediately above the first, which had a painted ceiling; we have already described the peculiar conditions of access to this rock-hole (see above). The paintings in this spot (Fig. 13) are poorly preserved and are not recognizable. Cultural Context In first place, as stated above, the three described shelters are not the only cases of painted rock sites discovered in the region: nearby, immediately south of the Kandag valley, in the Morah-sar and Kafir-kot areas, other rock shelters with 188 [16]</page><page sequence="17">the remains of ancient paintings were previously discovered (Nazir Khan 1994; Nazir Khan et al. 1995). In at least three of the reported cases (5) the most likely dating goes back to a historical period: more precisely the depictions of stupas suggest a dating bracketed between the 1st and the 3rd century AD. A more doubtful case is that of the Marano-tangai rock shelter, where a set of abstract symbols was recorded: squares intersected by a cross and squares filled with a single dot (Nazir Khan et al. 1995: fig. 14). We have previously stressed that, from a topographical viewpoint, the three shelters just discovered are located far from buddhist sacred areas, and thus differ in one important respect from those already known. On the other hand, the new painted shelters share the following features with the others: - geography: they all belong to the valleys of the left-hand tributaries of the Swat, west of mount Ham; - setting: natural, shallow rock shelters (paintings in caves are exceptional); - technique: monochromatic painting using bright red ochre, often applied with the fingers; - style: schematic-linear, with a distinct preference for abstract forms; - themes: human figures, structures, ideograms, animals being relatively rare. Humans are represented frontally, animals in profile; - syntax: complex, based upon associations among different group scenes and elaborated symbols. All this suggests that the seven shelters so far recorded, at least at a preliminary level of analysis, and in spite of the variable spatial relationships with buddhist complexes, belong to a single cultural framework. Our present goal is to discuss the new evidence in the light of such a hypothesis, providing a set of interpretations on the possible 'meanings' and cultural implications of the three figuration complexes, and proposing a preliminary chronology for the seven shelters. Methodology Before proposing any interpretation of the painted complexes and their possible chronology, we feel it is mandatory to express the fundamental criteria we adopted in pursuit of this goal. The overall interpretation of the three figuration complexes (5) The paintings of Kafir-kot (Nazir Khan et al. 1995: fig. 10), representing a buddhist sacred area with bowmen, the paintings of Shamo {ibid.: fig. 13) showing men with weapons, a horse (?) and a stupa, those of Hinduano-hatai (ibid.: fig. 16), showing a series of a stupa. [17] 189</page><page sequence="18">depends upon the acceptation of a series of established information elements. These elements are reviewed briefly in the following index. 1. Interpretation of individual design types (in terms of semantic elements). We will present the elements using the basic threefold classification proposed by E. Anati: pictograms, ideograms, psychograms (Anati 1994a: 39). (The numbers in parenthesis refer to the numbering system of each element of the three rock paintings). More precisely: Pictograms are signs in which we identify representations of objects, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures. Under this heading we will consider: - human figures, and the nature of their stylistic variations; - weapons, tools and emblems exhibited by humans (6); - animal figures and their implications. Ideograms are synthetic signs and schemes of more doubtful interpretation, such as: - squares, grids and abstract symbols; - painted dots. Finally, psychograms are signs indicating actions and dynamic relationships among the various components of the figuration. Psychograms are particularly ambiguous, even by definition, in that they possibly imply the existence of dynamic relationships between the painter and the painted figures, the painted elements themselves, these elements and the onlookers. This category may include: - painted dots; - association lines; - lines and graphics suggesting particular modifications of the human figures. 2. The interpretation of relational structures among the designs types. The latter issue involves, as fundamental steps, - the interpretation of diachronic relationships (relative sequence of designs and design types); - the interpretation of synchronic relationships (syntactic organization and spatial patterning of the designs) (7). Formal and stylistic comparisons between our figures and other representations, particularly those studied by the German teams in the Upper Indus, will provide another type of relationship that may help us to better understand the absolute chronology and the information contexts of the paintings. (6) When we propose dimensional evaluations of the items depicted in the paintings, we speak in gross comparative terms, inferred on the base of the nearby body parts of anthropomorphs, and obviously such estimates are purely hypothetical. (7) For the structuralistic concepts of 'grammar' and 'syntax' in the analysis of prehistoric rock art see the definition provided by E. Anati (1992: 97 and ff.); see also Tileg 1994: 70-75. 190 [18]</page><page sequence="19">Only after having established the values of this basic information shall we proceed to the required cultural and 'historical' comments. As will be seen, we have defined the syntax of the three painted shelters as 'complex' because many single figuration elements discussed under heading 1) acquire or expand their meaning only when considered in the more complex terms of 2), i.e. synchronic/spatial relationships (group scenes and overall spatial patterning). Only if these steps are performed with a reasonable degree of reliability could the identification of a basic lexicon of the painted complexes be considered an accomplished goal. Interpretation of rock art is one of the most thankless tasks in archaeology, and can hardly escape dangerous trips into conjectural realms. The method we adopted is possibly liable to excessive analytical fragmentation, and might appear unduly charged with structuralist jargon. At any rate, we hope that the final interpretations we propose - and we are fully aware of their highly speculative nature - will be coherent and stimulating enough to justify the effort. Fig. 14 - The main graphic variations of human figures; from the top: type A, type B, type D. Pictograms Human Figures (8) Considering the three complexes, humans are rendered in different styles, but in every case - as already stated - they are rendered frontally, and generally have round heads traced with finger-tip imprints; almost all have symmetrically open feet. With few (but significant) exceptions, the anthropomorphs have no sex. The arms are often outstretched, thus emphasizing the importance of various objects carried by the figures, as important attributes of the scenes (this point is discussed (8) For human figures as ideograms we point out that in the jiaguwen writing system of the Shang period (2nd millennium B.C.) some signs evidently come from transformations of the 'human figure' with secondary attributes such as the raised legs (see below, note 17) and a clearly marked sex (Chen Zao Fu 1987: fig. 28). Likewise, in the still undeciphered logo-syllabic writing system of the Indus valley (about 2600-1900 B.C.) many signs are obtained by the 'human figure' modified by specific postures and more or less recognizable items (tools, symbols and weapons). The study of the relationships among rock art of pre-literate societies, the development of ideograms and the birth of more advanced forms of writing has received an important input from the research of E. Anati. [19] 191</page><page sequence="20">in the next section). The most important variations on record affect the shape of the body (presence/absence of a torso, body contour suggested by a basic shape or by a peculiar dress, shape of the legs). These graphic variations may be thus described (Fig. 14): - type A, the simplest. Figures having a single horizontal line for the arms, two vertical segments for the legs and no torso (Sargah-sar: 3, 5, 9, 11, 18, 21, 22, 28, 33, 36) (Kakai-kandao 1: 15, 7, 8, 4, 3, 11, 12); - type B. Figures distinguished by a short segment for the torso and a peculiar inverted 'U'-shaped rendering of hips and legs (found only at Sargah-sar, where they represent the most common model: 2, 6, 13, 14, 15,19, 23, 27); - sub-type C. The figures are similar, but the legs appear as an inverted ?V (this type seems to be limited to the row of dancers on the saddle-shaped lower slab of Sargah-sar, and this probably explains why the feet are raised: 45, 46, 47, 48). - type D. Figures painted with a triangular body, the legs being short vertical traits at the base, at Sargah-sar: (4 and 8); at Kakai-kandao 1 (5); and the only type attested at Dwolasmanai-patai). Besides these four basic types, there are minor but nevertheless important isolated solutions. For example, an archer outside the arc-shaped niche at Sargah-sar has a hollow quadrangular body (49); a similar figure was found inside the shelter (43); in Kakai-kandao 1 the naturalistic rendering of a human figure with outstretched open hands and the indication of the fingers is a unicum (17). Furthermore, at Sargah-sar, where the whole right part of the main niche was covered by poorly preserved designs, at least two human figures are visible, depicted by means of parallel lines framing a hollow elongated torso. Note that the whole right part of the niche was covered by scarcely visible, washed-off designs, rendered by M.V. as dotted figures. We have the impression that this portion of the Sargah-sar complex actually belongs to a previous painting stage, partially revived, on the left, in the most evident designs. Viewed in this light, these graphic variations could be the result of chronology rather than style or contextual meaning. We will return to this point later. In contrast, types A, B and D were observed in the same conditions of conservation. Their close association in group scenes and some regularities in the associations provide good grounds for considering them to be substantially synchronic, and therefore for seeking other explanations for their variability (sub? type C was observed, as stated above, only in an isolated chain of dancers outside the main niche). As we shall see when describing the overall spatial organization of the Sargah-sar complex, there might be reason to consider type B human figures as interpreting peculiar, highly visible social and possibly economic roles. One major problem is the dichotomy between types A, B and sub-type C, on one side, and type D on the other: the latter case might actually refer to a peculiar type of dress, perhaps a gown, absent in the other cases. 192 [20]</page><page sequence="21">This dress raises some difficult questions: it possibly suggests a different role or status, as well as a sex distinction (does it indicate women?) or both. Some of the gown-wearing figures are seen also to be carrying tools and/or weapons. On the other hand, taking into account also the detail of the outstretched feet, it is hard to ignore the similarity between such a gown and a highly simplified rendering of the traditional central-Asian costume (as reflected, in rare cases, in the petroglyphs of the northern areas and in the royal iconography of the Kushana kings, as discussed below). As the implications of these diverging interpretations are completely different, the impossibility of a reliable identification is a major handicap for any attempt at interpretation. For the time being, we shall consider type D figures within their own contexts: as will be discussed later, the interpretation of these peculiar figures at Dwolasmanai-patai might not be simply exportable to the other two complexes. Weaponry, Tools and Emblems The identification of the types of tools and/or weapons associated with human figures in the images is obviously a crucial point, as it might provide useful clues for chronology. Unfortunately, the evidence is not fully satisfactory, as the items depicted in the three complexes may be described and interpreted with different degrees of reliability. Axes or Hoes At Sargah-sar, two humans (8 and 5) (type D and type A) are holding up a distinctive tool in their right hand. It is formed by a wooden (?) handle, perhaps 40 to 50 cm long, with a short oblique functional part. The use of this tool should conform to the category of 'oblique thrown percussion' of A. Leroi-Gouran (1993: 44-45). It could be a form of hoe (similar, for example to that illustrated in the same volume, at p. 67, 115: but we have no archaeological correlates) or an axe with a stone blade of the type commonly found in the Swat valley and the nearby areas in proto-historic times. In the first case, this implement would represent an agricultural tool; in the second case, the axe might represent an agricultural tool (being used for slashing and clearing the forest) as well as a weapon (see Biddulph 1880: 90, fig. 6). At Kakai-kandao 1, a badly weathered human figure (12) at the bottom of the niche may be holding up a similar implement while protecting him/herself with a round shield (?); this doubtful picture might thus support the idea of a kind of battle-axe. Shields In addition to a doubtful image (Kakai-kandao 1, 12), another shield is raised in defence by a human (27) at Sargah-sar, while protecting an ibex from an attacking feline (?). It is represented frontally, like its bearer. It is large and [21] 193</page><page sequence="22">round, with an apparent diameter of more than 1.50 m, and is characterized by a structure, or decoration, made of eight rays (9). Another shield may be found in Dwolasmanai-patai (7). Bows and Arrows At Sargah-sar, in spite of the large number of human figures, there is only one archer. This is located at the margin of the best preserved group, at left of the niche, i.e. at the transition with the possible 'older phase' of paintings. The bow is held in the left. The archer at the base of the complex possibly belonged to a row of human figures (2). The bow (1) has a simple semi-circular profile, with an inflected center for handling, and an apparent height of more than 1 m; the arrow in our drawing is confused with the arm and is nocked to the bowstring. Better drafted are the two bowmen recorded in the smaller complex of Kakai-kandao 1. In both cases, the bow belong to the type defined as 'simple reflected' by A. Leroi Ghouran (1994: 49, 751), i.e. the so-called Scythian bow, and is handled with the left. It is well known that this type of bow is one of the commonest in Central Asia from prehistoric times onward. The uppermost archer (7) belongs to type A, and is graphically connected to an anthropomorph of the same type. A sub-vertical stroke could represent an arrow, a quiver or some other type of weapon. The other one (16), distinguished by a peculiar inverted subtriangular torso, also seems to bear a quiver or another weapon (this time horizontal). The bows are possibly 1-1.50 m long. Two other archer-like figures - (3, 2) - belonging to type D, appear at the margin of the residual complex of Dwolasmanai-patai, but are badly weathered. The two bows seem to be shorter, and the arrows are depicted as if nocked. Other Possible Weapons or Emblems In the three complexes, there is no clearly recognizable depiction of swords or daggers, but this might be due to the poor standards of the graphics. At Sargah-sar, a human (23; type B) seems to be holding a vertical object in the right hand (a club, a stick, a blade?) perhaps ending in a complex but now missing extremity; but, it is probably a bodily modification. Immediately above, another figure (19; type B) is apparently holding in the palm of the hand a shorter, unidentified vertical object. This latter figure also touches the large dotted grids merging into a large anthropomorph at the center of the complex. No objects of this kind are visible in the complex of Kakai-kandao 1. At Dwolasmanai-patai, three figures (7, 8, 9; type (9) Similar elements have been interpreted as disks in MANP 3 11:7 and 86:4. 194 [22]</page><page sequence="23">D) surround the extremity of the geometric aggregate, and are holding three vertical objects. The upper one, preserved only in the lower part, is holding an unidentifiable object in the left hand that seems to protrude slightly below the hand (9). Then, after a five-dot rosette, comes another personage (8) with a triangular gown holding up another long club, stick, or pole in the same hand: the object seems to have a slightly rounded upper extremity and a thinner handle (?) visible immediately below the hand. The position of these two objects in the left hand seems to suggest a symbolic, rather than functional, use. In contrast, the third gowned figure (7), visible below, is holding a club, stick, or pole in the right hand; unfortunately, the extremity of the object, as well as the hand of the other arm, which seems connected to a shield (?) are not clear. A Possible Chariot Of particularly difficult interpretation is another possible animal picture in the Kakai-kandao 1 complex: figure (4), below a dotted square and to the right of the crossed wheel (3). The design is formed by a sequence of vertical lines, somehow connected with a series of 'parallel' sinuous lines. M.V., when recording the design, observed clear evidence of re-painting of the same sinuous lines, and had the impression that this group represented a flock of running birds, painted at different stages. L.M.O., on the contrary, suggests the possibility that these designs might be a transformation of a quadruped, perhaps tied to the chariot (?) or a vehicle symbolized by the wheels (3 and 1) on the left. The first hypothesis requires a precise identification of the running bird species (an ostrich obviously being ruled out); the second needs to take into account the fact that the wheel (of the vehicle?) is equipped with a trapeze-shaped lower appendix, and that the figure of the alleged quadruped, in the sequence in which it was painted, would be completely different from the graphic conception of the other three animal figures in these shelters. Animals The relative rarity of animal figures, as stated above, is a distinguishing trait of the three figuration complexes. At Sargah-sar, for example, animals are limited to the group, visible on the upper right, where a big ibex (28), possibly distinguished by its male organ, faces an attacking feline (29): the ibex is represented with a solid body, while the feline is schematically rendered as an elongated rectangle. Perhaps it is a tiger (as suggested by the inner stripes). The feline (?) seems to be attacking the herbivore with a raised paw, has a curled tail, and, according to the field interpretation by M.V., is perhaps represented while bleeding. In fact, a human (27) belonging to type B, and raising the described shield, itself attacks the feline with a gesture of [23] 195</page><page sequence="24">protection. The fact that above the ibex originally stood an anthropomorph might have important ideological implications. At Kakai-kandao 1, we meet a well drawn monkey with a raised tail (14). A line traced from the base of the tail to the right side of the nearby dotted square (and to one of the appendixes described above) might suggest defecation (?). At Dwolasmanai-patai, in the surviving part of the original painting, there are no animal designs. Squares Ideograms and Grids, Dots and Other Possible Abstract Symbols One of the few cross-cultural generalizations that seem to hold in rock art is that square or rectangular figures enclosing grids or rows of points recall and often openly symbolize land tenures and specifically ploughed fields. Points may symbolize the seeds, the cultivated plants or the rain fertilizing the plots. Several examples of similar designs, regularly associated with 'complex societies' endowed with agriculture and animal husbandry, may be cited to support this kind of semantic value (10). In the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent, where the earliest ploughed (10) For example, in the Shang writing system tian, the sign for 'field' is a square with an inscribed cross (Chen Zao Fu 1987: 183); a square with an inner cross and four dots is one of the symbols used in the writing system of the Indus valley civilization; in the rock carving complexes of Mount Bego (France) simple and complex grid patterns (3rd-2nd millennium B.C.) have been interpreted as ploughed fields, and inner incised points as fertilizing rain (De Lumley 1996: 241 ff.); in some examples of large rock carving compositions in Valcamonica (late 2nd millennium B.C., northern Italy) groups of squares and rectangles, sometimes with inner partitions, filled with rows of dots, are interpreted as cultivated fields, and the whole composition as a large 'topographic map' (Anati 1982); in Eritrea one sees some pictures of rock shelters with complex associations of partitioned squares and other more complex geometric figures filled with regular sequences of dots (the paintings, from the sites of Auhene, are in red ochre and have been preliminarily dated to the historical period; Calegari 1999: 111-16, figs. 142-145, 148, 152); in Tanzania, grid-like designs with partitions filled with dots ascribed to Bantu agriculturalists are superimposed on previous anthropomorphic and animal designs left by hunter-gatherers (Anati 1995: fig. 68). Squares with dots have been documented in the Upper Indus area (for example at Shatial, see MANP 2: pi. 37; at Hodar, see MANP 3: pis. 92 and 94), and even in the Ghinzar valley (East Hindukush, Pakistan) (Desio 1985: pi. Xl.a). Grids have been recently documented in Bajaur, in a cultural context distinguished by husbandry and horse riding (NWFP, Pakistan; Saeed-ur-Rahman 1996: fig. 34). The grids from the Upper Indus, Hindukush and Bajaur cannot be interpreted with certainty, but in an example (modern? see n. 2) from Noh (Yasin) a square with 5 dots is connected to a human figure, and, following the interpretation suggested here, might imply the meaning of 'land possession' (Tsuchiya 1994: fig. 8). At an elementary, proto-lexical level one might recognize the value of 'non natural' or 'artificial' elements in signs formed by parallel and/or orthogonal lines: this is also suggested by the elements rendering the 'stupd pictograms. Grids, partitioned squares and rectangles, stand out as very peculiar in the context of a naturalistic (although schematic) figuration, distinguished by human and animal figures. A comparison could be made with a grid-like square from Elangash region (Altaj, CSI): at the center of a scene dominated by wild and domestic animals stands this ideogram, seemingly having the 196 [24]</page><page sequence="25">fields (dated to the 3rd-2nd millennia B.C.) were ploughed following precise grid? like orthogonal patterns (n), these correlations might be even more significant. In this paper, we therefore accept, this generalization, and will interpret these abstract designs through the very meaning of 'ploughed fields'; grids filled with dots will themselves be interpreted as 'ploughed/sown fields'. At Sargah-sar, the focus of the surviving part of the figuration complex includes a square with an inner cross and dots, a complex anthropomorph resulting from the merging of complex grid-like structures with inner dots (20), and a different square internally divided by diagonals, and having four inner dots in the partitions, with two segments protruding from as many corners (50). Another simple, small rectangle subdivided into 2 squares is visible on the lower left boundary of the complex (51). Another square containing dots may be seen in the upper part of the complex (16); a square grid may be seen on the left (7). These geometric patterns are surrounded and in some cases touched by human figures. Finally, in the upper left part of the niches, a human figure seems to be holding up one of the most complex symbols of the series, a kind of spiral inside a rectangle surrounded on four sides by double armed crosses (10). At Kakai-kandao 1, the designs include a square with an inner cross and dots (13), a smaller square with 4 dots (15), and, on the right edge, an isolated element apparently formed by a rectangle divided into 2 parts filled, once more, with 2 dots (10). One of the most interesting features of the Kakai-kandao 1 geometric designs is the fourfold appendixes visible in the two larger figures (13 and 15). In the largest square (13), this appendix is formed by four parallel segments, possibly joined at the upper extremity by a horizontal one. In the rectangle on the far right, a similar element hangs from the lower side. If the squares actually do represent 'ploughed fields', these elements (whose importance is stressed by the evidence of re-painting, see also below) might be pictograms indicating accesses to the fields (12), and thus value of 'structure' or 'field', in any case having some relationship with the human element (Okladnikov 1979: pi. 20.1). The relationship of this type of ideogram with a non natural or artificial context of signification, are clear in hunters' culture rock art, where the predominant figures are of the zoomorphic type. There is a very interesting Neolithic composition from Bajkal Lake with squares associated with human figures, big anthropomorphs and maskoids: here the cup-marks have replaced the painted dots (Okladnikov 1969: 204). Lastly, in a similar cultural horizon, let us consider the pictograms related to 'structures' from the area of Ulug-chem (Upper Jenisei, Tavinskaja, CSI; Devlet 1976: fig. 16, pis. 29-32). These dotted grid-like designs are dated to the last 5000 years, and therefore document more a convergence in psychological adaptation than a chronological trend (see n. 12). (n) For Kalibangan in Haryana, India, see Thapar 1973; for Aligrama, in the Swat valley, see Tusa 1979. (12) These eccentric appendixes may be compared with similar elements applied to round elements filled with dots in the paintings at the cave of Porto Badisco (Puglia, Italy), dated to the 3rd millennium B.C. (Graziosi 1973: fig. XVII.c), as well as to similar compositions at Mount Bego (France), 3rd-2nd millennium B.C. (De Lumley 1996: fig. 186). In the latter two cases, at any rate, the designs might well represent controlled animal enclosures. [25] 197</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 15 - Human figure above stupa; from Hodar. (After MANP3: pl. 102). 'property', or perhaps small water channels. Still today, the possibility of cultivating mountain plots depends upon being able to convey the water of mountain springs downhill onto terraced fields. In this light, stressing the possession of water might refer to a much wider 'power landscape' in the valley slopes. At any rate, such pictograms might also have quite different, subtler implications (see below). At Dwolasmanai-patai, where the greater part of the figuration complex has probably been effaced by erosion, the designs are incomplete and unclear. At the center of the surviving part, at any rate, a major, irregular aggregate of small squares and rectangles with inner dots (6) is visible. From the upper extremity (?) there hangs an isolated tree? like element. This aggregate lacks the isolation and the regularity of the geometric elements of the other two shelters (13). Dots (14) Dots painted with the fingertips appear in different contexts in the three complexes. At Sargah-sar, one dot appears between the legs of a type B human, emphasizing his genital region; other two points are symmetrically placed, and (13) A generic comparison with some 'stupa derivative' figures documented in the petroglyphs of the Upper Indus could be proposed, on the basis, at least, of the hanging Vegetal' element; but our design (or part of design) seems to lack the symmetry distinguishing the carved reproduction of such structures. In some cases these figures have anthropormophic features, as at Hodar, 12:3 and 12:15 (MANP 3: pi. 1), comparable to anthropomorph 116:19 (group 116:C in MANP 3: pi. 114). (14) Points represent a very difficult problem. Anati, after having reviewed a lot of figurations in which points appear together other images, considers them to be emphasizing psychograms, and this might hold true for the Kandak cases as well; but in some of the cases we suggested the pictographic meaning of 'seed'. In the folk art of some parts of India dots niay have the explicit meaning of 'seed'. In the folk art of some parts of India, dots may have the explicit meaning of 'seed'. For example, in the Kolam of Tamil Nadu ( magic-religious diagrams traced as auspicious signs on floors and walls) the basic design of the svastika develops into an endless knot. These Kolam form also grids whose cells are filled with 'seeds' (dots), obviously wishing fertility (Kramrish 1985: figs. 9-10). Among the Upper Indus figuration complexes so far published, positive comparisons may be found at Hodar (MANP 3). When points are depicted around the blade of an axe, they might suggest a toothed edge (MANP 3: 56, figs. 41, 42); when they appear together with shields they could be pictograms indicating 'appliques of soft leather' (MANP 3: 26, figs. 19, 20), while together with wheel-like 'sun symbols' or crossed disks they might have different, non pictographic meanings. On the other hand, they are probably pictographic points like those in 35:96 (appearing above a stupa) (Fig. 15; MANP 3: pi. 102), 69:63 (MANP 3: pi. 11); 198 [26]</page><page sequence="27">highly visible, on the head of the human (27) attacking the 'tiger' or another feline. Furthermore there are the sequences of dots painted within the grids forming the focus of the complex. In the same complex, an abstract design of concentric circles is surrounded by other small dots (26). At Kakai-kandao 1, besides those painted within the squares, a dot sometimes appears on the paw of the monkey. At Dwolasmanai-patai, isolated dots or pairs of dots fill the square partitions of the main aggregate of geometric elements. On top of the central figure, a rosette made up of five dots appears between two type D figures (10). The ideological background of some of these elements of figuration - as suggested, in particular, by the Sargah-sar designs - might be the Fig. 16 - Human figures with dots; from Hodar. (After MANP 3: pi. 110). association, unconscious or conscious, among the ideas of male organs/seeds/rain drops (Olivieri 2001a). On the other hand, if we think that these graphic complexes were 'revived' at recurrent intervals of time, by touching the pre-existing figures with red-splashed fingertips the painters might have been meant to retell specific events, sentences and historical recollection of the tribe. Thus, they might easily assume the value of 'psychograms' connecting the painter, the figure and the onlookers in a unified information context. Psychograms Speaking in more general terms, E. Anati (1992) and others have suggested that similar dots in prehistoric rock art might represent ideas, words, sounds, and rhythmic gestures that the painters ascribed to their subjects, and are better less convincing (in spite of its frequency) the interpretation of human figures with 2 points aside the chest as 'woman' (group 110: C; MANP 3: pi. 114). Points associated with important animal figures such as the ibex should doubtless be considered emphasizing devices. See for example figure 103:6 (MANP 3: pi. 112), where the interpretation dots = blood is not convincing (MANP 3: 366; see also 4:11 and 34:17 in MANP 3: pi. 27, 40). Points mark all the most relevant designs, such as 'sun wheels' (see the extraordinary case of figure 4:34 in MANP 3: pi. 69), axes, ibexes, stupa designs, abstract or anthropomorphic symbols (like in 12:3 and 12:15 in MANP 3: pi. 1), dominating anthropomorphs: also relevant are human figures with raised arms and dots, like 97:B and 97:C (Fig. 16; MANP 3: pi. 110). Points are also associated with grids and squares: but in this last case we do not propose the meaning of 'ploughed/sown fields'. In a quite different context (Tuul and Bogd uul, Mongolia; see also similar neolithic depictions around the Baikal lake in Okladinov 1969: 204; Anati 1995: 31) squares and dots interestingly have been interpreted, after a structuralistic analysis of archaeological data, as pictograms representing megalithic collective burial fields (Nowgorodowa 1980: figs. 70-72). [27] 199</page><page sequence="28">conceived of in terms of psychograms. This might well be the case, for example, of the two dots visible on the head of figure (27) in the Sargah-sar complex. Other psychograms might consist of the wavy lines connecting some of the figures: for example, in humans (21), (11) and (12) in the Sargah-sar complex, where elongated arms might convey the idea 'property' or a precise relationship with the ideogram 'ploughed/sown fields'. Another association line connects the human figure (30) to the ibex (28). Similar lines may also be observed at Kakai-kandao 1. Here the ideogram 13 ('ploughed/sown fields') is connected to various figures by the means of threefold sinuous lines: interestingly, such lines seem partly to represent independent designs, and partly to be modifications of the bodies of the human figures themselves. From this point of view, the threefold or fourfold sinuous lines of Kakai-kandao 1 might be psychograms having the semantic value of 'property' or a more generic association, or more simply, as proposed above, ideograms with the value of 'irrigation'. In our pictures we may observe several instances of modification of the human body: at Sargah-sar, see the case of the archer holding a bow with a nocked arrow possibly rendered with a sinuous line (2); the legs of figure (36) are noticeably elongated; at Kakai-kandao 1 one may consider figure (18), whose left foot has perhaps been changed into a kind of crab-like claw, while the left arm appears elongated and surmounted by an emphatizing dot. Note also anthropomorph (17), whose left hand is also turned into a kind of pincer. Diachrony The most significant evidence of painting in subsequent phases and of re? painting was observed by M.V. in the Sargah-sar complex. It includes not less than 50 figures, 5 of which outside the main painted niche; some figures, particularly the peripheral ones, on the right hand side of the main niche, are badly faded, and some considerable effort was required to record them. Apparently, some of the anthropomorphic figures are different from those described as types A-D. For example, the body of figure (43) seems to be an empty rectangle, the head has a beak-like feature, while at the waist (?) there is curved feature that might be some kind of garment. Another figure seems to have the same rectangular body, and there is a (|)-like design (32) that has no match in the best preserved part of the complex (15). On the other hand, a faded human picture at the boundary between the right area and the best preserved core on the right might represent a type B depiction. &lt;j)-like anthropomorphs are well known in various types of ancient rock figuration complexes of Eurasia (Graziosi 1973: 147): from the cave of Arnalo dei Bufali at Sezze (Lazio, Italy) to Porto Badisco (Puglia, Italy), to several examples in Central Asia. For example, in the Elangash petroglyphs published in Okladnikov 1979, this designs is variously associated to that of an 'archer with nocked arrow'. Similar transformations may be observed in the late non-buddhist depictions of archers on foot and on horseback in the Upper Indus. 200 [28]</page><page sequence="29">Possibly, two successive phases of painting are represented in Sargah-sar; but the figures are so badly preserved that it is impossible to say anything positive about their graphic features or style, or, as is evident, on the chronology of the two hypothetical phases. The best preserved part of the Sargah-sar complex, on the left, was characterized by the following cases of painting in successive stages: - on the extreme left, four humans (5, 6, 8, 9) were painted around a simple grid of nine (?) empty squares. This grid is faded enough to suggest that humans had been arranged in such as way as to respect a pre-existing ideogram (7); - in the central part of the complex, the large dotted grid composition (20) seems to have been painted at a later stage or re-painted over an anthropomorphic figure, thus creating the impression of the graphic emergence of a larger, dominant human figure from the 'ploughed/sown fields' ideograms. At Kakai-kandao 1, similar evidence refers to the 'ploughed/sown fields' ideogram (13). Detailed observation shows that a threefold appendix similar to the upper one, now barely visible, had been previously painted on the right hand side of the square. Likewise, the possible zoomorph (4), variously interpreted as a quadruped tied to a vehicle or a group of running birds, is hard to understand precisely because it includes a series of sinuous traits painted at several different stages. No evidence of re-painting has been observed in Dowlasmanai-patai. Spatial Patterning and Syntactic Organization of the Figuration Complexes Thus, when some of the paintings were arranged in terms of relative chronology, we saw that at least some of the figures had been applied respecting pre-existing patterns, while others were re-painted, retracing their contours or reproducing their identifying features. This evidence supports the view that we are not dealing with narrative descriptions, but with syntactic associations of symbols or statements referable to given events. The information codes are conceptual rather than narrative, and acquire and produce meaning only inasmuch the painter and its community of onlookers could easily identify a basic symbolic lexicon. The three complexes are dominated by human figures; the signs and abstract symbols seem to be the central focus of the best preserved part of the complex; the animals are secondary. In our attempt at interpreting such codes, we discuss some of the most important elementary associations encountered in the three complexes, namely: humans and the objects representing role attributes, humans and the 'ploughed fields' ideograms, the main animal figures (ibex, feline, monkey). As a further and final step, pictograms, ideograms, psychograms, the associations and oppositions encountered will now be discussed in more general terms of spatial and structural patterning, i.e. of a wider and coherent syntactic organization. [29] 201</page><page sequence="30">Humans and Their Role Attributes: Syntax, Associations and Comparisons The most significant grounds on which to base an attempt at interpreting the role of the human figures is obviously the Sargah-sar complex. Here, in our view, the design elements so far reviewed are connected by a complex set of rules of associations, that actually give meaning to a basic information lexicon. A simple pictogram may be associated with another pictogram, ideogram or psychogram, thus creating a composite pictogram. For example, by associating dancing humans in a row or providing them with a simple pictogram such as 'bow' or 'tool' the painter created complex signs possibly indicating a particular activity, condition or status. In this way, the painter perhaps indicated an infinitive-mode action (such as 'to hunt', 'to cultivate', 'to dance', and the like). In our case study we recognized two types of actions: material action (identifiable after a pictographic attribute) and abstract action (after modification of human bodies suggesting particular conditions or associations by the means of ideograms or psychograms). Material action is suggested by specific attributes also in the scenes of 'hunting'. An abstract action is that of indicating possession of or preferential association with 'ploughed fields' grids: in this case the action is suggested by outstretched arms touching the borders of the grids. Body parts may be extended to psychograms such as sinuous lines, suggesting important relationships and meanings. The information code thus includes objects indicating material actions or alterations of the body suggesting abstract actions, specific values or important associations (16). In this light, we may observe that similar body extensions towards important ideograms are met in the late period carvings of the Upper Indus repertory, for example in the rock complexes of Thalpan Bridge. Other examples may be found in the carvings dating to historical times, found in Ladakh (17). In the Sargah-sar complex some human figures that may or may not bear objects attributes have a simplified rendering (type A). Such a linear, poorly characterized style is hard to date and has only limited terms of comparison (18). (16) See for example, at Sargah-sar, the archer (2), whose power, besides the mark of the sex, might be indicated by the elongated, sinuous line of the arm. Such an evident syntactic expression is recurrent in several rock art figuration complexes: the late protohistoric carvings of Elangash, produced by evolved societies of hunters, show several similar examples (Okladinov 1979). (17) In one case, the duel between two bowmen is emphasized by the means of a psychogram, a sinuous line joining the two warriors (Orofino 1990: fig. 24); see above, n.14. (18) The linear, schematic rendering of these figures is non-historic, and reliable dating is difficult: similar features are shared by the Baluchistan and Middle Indus rock art complexes and by those of the Peshawar plain, for example at Tor-derai, at Kashmir-smast (Sanghao), at Hathiano-kandao (near the Kandag area), the recently discovered complexes at Bajaur (Saeed-ur-Rehman et al. 1996; Ashraf Khan et al. 1999-2000) Mardan and Swabi Districts (Shah Nazar Khan 1995; Nasim Khan 2000), and the few published complexes of Chitral. For these sites quite different datings were proposed (see the references in Nazir Khan et al. 1995: n. 2). 202 [30]</page><page sequence="31">Perhaps it may be recognized in late, non buddhist rock-carvings in the Upper Indus; but here the syntax is quite different. Type A humans should be interpreted as 'men': perhaps, together with the 'gown' or 'tunic' pictogram such signs might mean 'women' (type D). But the same association, in this or in other contexts, might have the value of 'man wearing a gown or tunic': in such cases, the indication of gender might also include the association with the 'bow' pictograms, thus creating a further, complex pictogram: 'archer wearing a tunic', i.e. (type D). But are we really justified in excluding the possibility that the designs represent women exhibiting their bows? Type A figures, again at Sargah-sar, may show another ideogram-like body modification, the 'upturned feet', that, together with the gesture of holding hands in a row that, as stated above, might suggest 'dancing' (19). As well as type A, another pictogram represents an important variant of the meaning 'man': the figures having inverted 'U'-like legs (type B). This peculiar type is not formed by other pictograms, but possibly includes an ideogram (the inverted 'U'-shaped legs: do they represent a body posture?). Such a modified pictogram may well represent a specific social segment of the societies that created the designs and recognized their values. Type B figures may be compared to cases in the late rock carvings of the Upper Indus (20). Type B humans may be seen in all the main clusters of our complexes, and do not necessarily exhibit tools or other attributes. Thus, in the 'hunting' scene with the 'tiger' and the ibex, a type B personage with a big shield plays the role of the hero (21), while an enlarged type B anthropomorph inserted in the large, composite 'ploughed/sown fields' (20) is the leading figure in the center of the complex. In this latter case, its dominant character would be expressed not only by the anomalous size and by the indication of the male organ, but also by its dynamic creation from the very structure of cultivated land: all this supports the idea that type B humans played an important or dominating role in their ancient society. In general, at any rate, it is hard to deny that type B figures at Sargah-sar play leading roles, although the precise meaning of each scene seems hard to interpret. (19) In a quite remote, and more ancient context, the rock carvings of Carrizo Plain (California, USA) a similar body modification in a pictogram meaning 'man', together with the 'sun' ideogram has been interpreted as a 'genuflection' (Anati 1994a: 141, fig. 135); see n. 8 on the presence of this grapheme in Shang script. (20) There are many examples of 'U'-like human figures: of particular interest are the examples from Hodar (MANP 3) which show a clear association with dots (scene 97:C, published here in Fig. 15), with outstretched fingers (36:68, 80:3), with shield (26:115), with mask? (3:3). All these examples are related to 'men' as is clearly indicated by the sex. Other examples are spread throughout the Upper Indus production: i.e. the petroglyph of Thor-S?d (interpreted as a 'praying man'; see K?nig 1994: fig. 2). (21) To be compared with the image of an anthropomorph bearing a shield at Hodar: 26:115 (MANP 3: pi. 4; note the 'U'-like body and the shield with inner rays). [31] 203</page><page sequence="32">As we shall discuss later, the general context of figuration suggests that dots, in the main cluster, might represent seeds and sowing. The important type B figure (27), as already stated, has two dots above the head, and figure (23), of the same type, bears another dot (22) in its pincer-like hand. Another transformation of the human figure might be seen in the possible theriomorphic features visible in figure (23) at Sargah-sar (highly uncertain) and figures (17) and (18) at Kakai-kandao 1 (equally uncertain). Here we may observe a peculiar form of ideographic transformation of the human body. Although there is a general consensus that similar images in rock art might refer to the presence and activities of shamans (23), few cases have been studied and reported in detail; this handicap, and the poor preservation of the designs, suggested that this hypothesis should be viewed with particular caution. The 'outstretched fingers' body transformation visible in figure (17) at Kakai kandao 1 is frequently found in some figures with theriomorphic features defined as D?mon in the Upper Indus (Jettmar 1992: 21). Sometimes the same transformation appears together with figures distinguished by their large size: for example in late period carvings showing a scene with five figures: three men have raised arms, with outstretched hands (Jettmar 1992: fig. 5). The Hodar carvings, with a large anthropomorph, date to a similarly late period, perhaps a pictogram indicating a (22) There are many possible examples of the use of similar dots in prehistoric rock art, besides the figures found at Kafir-kot, to be discussed later: except the examples cited in n. 14, we can consider the examples dated to historical ages, known from Ladakh: threefold dots associated with human figures (Orofino 1990: fig. 24), while threefold or simple dots are associated with ibex figures (ibid.: fig. 23). Tincer' transformations are uncommon: one possible variation is the 'hook' of the 'dancers of scene 89:A at Hodar (MANP 3: pi. 108) (but this feature might also suggest 'moving hands'). Of possibly greater relevance is the comparison with an anthropomorph in a rather distant area, the Bureja river (Amur region, CSI) (Mazin 1986: pi. 89.6) as well as with a carving at Ulug-chem (Upper Jenisei, Tavinskaja, CSI, see Devlet 1976: pi. 47.2): in this case together with sun symbols, hunters, dogs and ibexes. For dots applied around the head or near arms and legs see the above quoted examples from Hodar 35:96 e 60:63 (see n. 11), but also, in the Amur region, an anthropomorph with maskoid, shield and five dots above the head in Mazin 1986: pi. 47.1.2. (23) Although similar expressions have been well known in rock art since the middle-magdalenian complexes, the only possible comparison comes from ethnoarchaeological evidence from contemporary South Africa. J.D. Lewis-Willams, on the basis of direct oral information, has interpreted theriomorphic transformations of human figures Koisan (Southern San) as indicating a status of shamanic trance (Lewis-Williams 1981, 1983). In this case, the Koisan painters (if possible) 'translated' the meanings of mysterious psychograms: a series of dots was 'illness abandoning a man', a wavy line below a dancer was 'the energy of dancing', a line joining two shamans was explained as 'a transfer of energy'. Moreover, complex ideograms explained as 'men with a antelope head' (cf. Hodar 90:13 and 90:14 of the scene 90:B in MANP 3: pi. 108; see Olivieri 1998: 84) represented 'men absorbed in dance', or 'men in a state resembling death' (Lewis-Williams 1983: 48-64). Thus, figure 23 of Sargah-sar and 8 and 9 of Kakai-kandao 1 the meaning of 'men in a particular relationships with the animal world', 'shamans' might be a possibility. For the possible shamanic implications of some designs at Hodar see MANP 3: 11-16. 204 [32]</page><page sequence="33">'military chief with the same features (Jettmar 1992: fig. 6) (24). Another example, dated to the Iron Age, was recorded at Alchi, Ladakh (Francfort et al. 1990: fig. 24). On the other hand, in more general terms such a body transformation is well known in rock art, and is frequently interpreted as an indicator of 'energetic' conditions (Anati 1995: 120). Figure (18), besides other transformations, has in the left foot a pincer-like feature, as at Sargah-sar figure (23). This element is less common: an interesting comparison comes from an anthropomorph characterized as 'great' with (24) See some recent Kafir painted panels in Bambret (sic) (Chitral, Pakistan); in one case, humans with 'outstretched fingers' surround a mating couple. The hierarchy among the figures is emphasized by the reduced size of the central couple (Desio 1985: pi. XXI.a). A similar dominant role may be proposed for an anthropomorph with 'outstretched fingers', with a marked sex, associated with ibex and maskoids in petroglyphs of the Ulug-chem region (upper Jenisei, Tavinskaja, CSI) (Devlet 1976: pi. 7). The most significant comparisons are with carvings 18:237, 28:9, 28:14, 39:118, 42:4, 47:8, 50:5, 52:1, 70:3, 97:10, 100:1, 100:2 of Oshibat (MANP 1: pis. 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9). Humans with 'outstretched fingers' dominate group hunting scenes with humans and ibexes (scene 70:A and 100:A in MANP 1: pi. 36). At Shatial this type of transformation is visible in 215:19 and 219:7; in this latter case with hunters and ibexes in dominating position (MANP 2: pi. 2). At Hodar the same transformation is very common: see 3:3, 4:54, 2:26, 24:12, 24:16, 24:23, 24:44 (like 4:54, with outstretched feet, fingers), 24:56, 25:23 , 26:38, 26:39, 26:42, 26:44, 26:45 , 26:106, 26:154, 26:160, 26:163 , 26:174, 26:180, 27:4, 27:14, 29:11, 29:22, 29:23 (like 4:54), 30:12, 30:14, 30:18, 35:4, 35:68, 35:73 (with four lines over the head, together with an ibex), 35:96 (already cited, with dots, placed on the top of a stupa), 35:103, 37:2 and 37:4 (with an axe), 37:8, 38:3, 47:21, 49:7 (with a shield), 52:19, 56:7, 58:4 (with shield and helmet?), 62:3, 64:6 8, with a dot on the left of the head), 65:29, 70:29, 70.38, 80:3, 80:4, 80:9 (with standard?), 83:13 (with comb-like fingers), 83:17, 86:6 (with axe and shield); figures 4:28 (with dots), 12:24, 13:2, 13:5 (with dots), 35:69 and 115:1 rise above horses (in others the identification of the fingers is uncertain). Particularly relevant are anthropomorphs 12:11, 94:2 (with four lines and flame? like designs on the head), 14:4, 35:102, 78:3 (the head represented by a crossed disk) and 78:4 (the head represented by a crossed square) (MANP 3:pls. 1-7, 9-12, 19-25, 107). Also significant is figure 103:6 (cited above). We know, thanks to the depiction of the sex, that the figures cited are all males, and some have an inverted 'U'-like body; many have the torso depicted as a 'ladder', or made with bands, and in others the head has animal features. For example, carving 52:1 at Oshibat seems to indicate a 'shaman' or a 'guide-spirit': the triangle-shaped face, the ribs (an indication of fasting or of a post mortem condition), the genitals and the stick, might be attributes of such a status. Also the transformation 'outstretched fingers', in other contexts, might point to supernatural features (both for suggesting 'spirits', or 'intermediaries with the spiritual world'): see for example some figures at Helanku (Ningxia, northern China): here 'ancestral spirits' might have, as well as other attributes, 'outstretched fingers' (Anati 1994b: figs. 43-46). Apparently, the ideogram 'men with outstretched fingers' has a recurrent meaning: among many possible examples we cite the cases of Style IV in the Negev (Anati 1979). In carvings from Wadi Avdat and Ramat Matred, large humans thus transformed appear together with ibexes. Similarities may also be observed in the iconography of seals and searings from Near-Eastern Bronze-age sites. Among the many possible comparisons, note a seal from Susa, showing an anthropomorph with 'outstretched fingers' and other transformations of the legs: the sex is rendered as a snake rising towards the face of the figure, and the personage appears together with 'trees', 'wild goat or ibex', 'sun symbol' (Mazzoni 1992: 50, pi. XLI.7). In Near-Eastern Bronze-age glyptics one commonly encounters body transformations, associations, ideograms later exploited by proto-historic and historic rock art. A systematic comparison might prove useful. [33] 205</page><page sequence="34">arms folded above the head to form an ideogram-circle and a pincer-like foot in the Ghariala carving complex (Campbellpur, Punjab, Pakistan) (Gordon 1953: pi. XXIV.&amp;). Another interesting comparison is the great anthropomorph with a pincer like modification of the right arm in association with an archer, dogs, ibexes and a 'sun symbol' (hunting scene) in a petroglyph from Ulug-chem (Upper Jenisei, Tavinskaja, CSI, in Devlet 1976: pi. 47). The paintings at Dwolasmanai-patai are different from those observed at Kakai kandao 1 and Sargah-sar, and to some extent resemble those previously found at Kafir-kot. The preserved part comprises ten figures, namely six type D humans surrounding a composite ideogram on the right hand side. Between figures (8) and (9) we see an ideogram formed by a five pointed rosette (10). All the human figures wear a 'tunic'. The best preserved (8) possibly differs from the type D garments observed at Sargah-sar, in that it resembles a dress tied at the waist with some kind of belt. With the possible exception of (5), all bear a weapon, a tool or an attribute: a bow, a sword (?), a pole or a mace (?) held in the left hand. The object-pictograms openly characterize the role of the figures, like the possible axes or hoes did at Sargah-sar. While at Sargah-sar these objects defined a concrete action and thus a precise status within the community, at Dwolasmanai-patai such attributes seem to have a merely descriptive character. The representation of bows does not seem to show the power of the warrior: instead, the weapon is depicted in detail, without any dynamic trait: the bow, as already stated, is short, of Scythian fashion, and the arrow is nocked. Even the action of the bent arm (absent in the other cases) does not express movement, but a didactic expedient. These figures may be positively compared to a rock carving in the Upper Indus, at Chilas II (Jettmar &amp; Thewalt 1985: 16). This carving, dated to the historical period, shows two human figures wearing a long kaftan-like dress, holding a club in the right hand and some attributes (a standard? a shield?) in the left. Another interesting comparison can be proposed with carving from Chitral showing an archer dressed in a long kaftan, hunting an ibex (Maraini 1997: fig. 82). In Kushana iconography one finds the same long kaftan, open, in front, over soft boots, worn in the typical posture of the outstretched spread legs. Of course, the depiction of the club (danda) is quite significant. In the famous headless statue of Kaniskha at Mathura it is held by the king in the left arm, while in the right he holds his sword by the hilt (Verardi 1983). Other examples come from the Ladakh area, where at least one example is positively associated with Kushana power (by the inscription 'Vima Kadphises'; Tucci 1958: 294; Orofino 1990: 181). The iconography is the same (Orofino 1990: figs. 21, 33). Human Figures and the Association with 'Ploughed/'Sown Fields Pictograms Let us go back for a moment to the composite ideogram 'ploughed/sown field'/large type B anthropomorph that we have considered as the core of the main niche complex at Sargah-sar. The emergence of this figure from the 'sown fields' might 206 [34]</page><page sequence="35">indicate a transcendent event involving a divinity closely related to agricultural land. In our analysis, this might be confirmed by the association of 'ploughed fields' ideograms with 'seeds' and the composite 'man' (type B). A similar association may be found in a different geo? graphic context, but probably in a similar cultural-economic context. At Tin Anneuin (southwest Libya) (Cremaschi 2001: 84) a large anthropo? morph associated with palms, indicating an oasis, and thus Fig. 17 - On the left the Sargah-sar composite ideogram (20); on the right the Tin Anneuin anthropomorph. (After Cremaschi 2001: 84). control over water, is formed by an organized cluster of dotted squares or rectangles. The image is dated to a late Garamantic phase, i.e. to an evolved agricultural-pastoral tribal horizon interacting, in the historical period, with a larger early statal organization. The analogy, in spite of the geographic and ecological remoteness, is doubtless surprising. In both cases, anthropomorphs with possible supernatural features emerge from symbols of agricultural landscapes. Their dominating nature might be related to the hardship of politically controlling agricultural land where good watered fields are a very restricted and disputed resource (Fig. 17). At Chilas II, in Karakorum, we may also consider a representation dated to the 1st century B.C. Here we see the association between the 'stupa' ideogram (not the 'stupa pictogram) that presents more emphasized descriptive features, such as those at Kafir-kot) and a composite 'man' pictogram whose size involves the additional meaning of 'big' (Jettmar &amp; Thewalt 1985: pi. 12). This ideogram is relevant both because aside it may be viewed as an anthropomorphic cult pillar, and because of the nearby inscription 'H?ritf, that defines the figure as a divinity. Note also that in the case of the large anthropomorph of Sargah-sar the fashion of the legs (type B) is reminiscent of the sitting posture of H?riti, and the triangular sign visible between the legs, besides suggesting a sexual attribute, might also be the ideogram 'bunch of grapes' that, as a symbol of fertility, might be an attribute of the goddess (see the statue of the de Marteau collection; Bussagli 1984: 125). Transformations of pictographs with the probable value of 'structures' into anthropomorphs are well known in Karakorum rock art of the buddhist period (see for example some 'stupa derivatives'), as well as in the late non-buddhist production: from ideograms interpreted as symbols of mountains, carved with the ibex at Hodar (Jettmar &amp; Thewalt 1985: pi. 23), to the anthropomorphs of Chilas III (Jettmar &amp; Thewalt 1985:27). [35] 207</page><page sequence="36">Of possible relevance is the comparison with a set of carvings from Thalpan II where 'ploughed fields' are modified by pairs of long, closed wavy lines, repeated in the nearby ibex carvings: in this latter case, the lines are open and emphasize the obvious pictogram 'horns'. The close correlation between 'horns' and the wavy lines possibly underlines an ideological association between the animal and farmland, probably after the fertility value sometimes given to the ibex icon (Tucci 1963: 127-28; Olivieri 1998: 82-84). The same association is found in a more ancient context at Gogdara I, in figure 17: here we see the transformation of a square divided by diagonals and marked by inner dots ('ploughed fields') by the means of a nearby 'ibex' pictogram: the composite ideogram thus created is further transformed into a standard (Olivieri 1998). We propose a final comparison with a presumably much older context (3rd-2nd millennium B.C.?): the rock carvings at Thalpan Ziyarat (Upper Indus; Jettmar &amp; Thewalt 1985: pi. 3). Here, a square divided by diagonals, with points near the intersection, is transformed into an anthropomorph with theriomorphic features: the hands, far from the body, have outstretched fingers, and the legs are upturned ('dance'? 'genuflection'?). Above the square, which forms the head of the figure, there is a series of straight lines suggesting hair (25). Some of the associations we have seen in the Kandag paintings, in this light, might be quite old, and may have survived until relatively recent periods. This is also supported by the dating to the buddhist period of a figure of a 'giant' with similar features (outstretched fingers and raised hair) at Chilas IV (Jettmar &amp; Thewalt 1985: pi. 22). Animal Figures Are Not Simple Pictograms The important role played by the few animal representations in two of the three complexes has already been mentioned. These figures are not simple pictograms, but appear rather as ideograms: in other words, although they represent recognizable species, they probably suggested also abstract ideas. The very fact that, in two cases, the animals are represented with an abnormally large size seems to support this hypothesis. Let us take as a first example the case of the ibex of Sargah-sar. The fact that at Gogdara I the second type of animal, after the ibex, is the leopard, and that the Sargah-sar ibex is faced by a large feline can hardly be considered as a coincidence. The ibex-leopard (or ibex-tiger) couple seems to represent a recurrent syntactic element in the rock art of the Upper Indus valley. The Sargah-sar scene, in our opinion, has deeper symbolic implications, and does not represent an element of description of the wild world, as possibly happened in the Upper Indus. However, one important comparison is provided precisely by one of the Upper Indus sites, (25) A similar design in the previously cited Koisan paintings reportedly had the meaning of 'near death', i.e. of a trance status. Note the above mentioned figures with four lines over the head from Hodar (see n. 24). 208 [36]</page><page sequence="37">Fig. 18 - A leopard (?) and an ibex (?); from Hodar. (After MANP 3: pi. 103). Fig. 19 - Ibex associated with a human figure; from Hodar. (After MANP 3: pi. 112). Hodar: the scene 37:A presents features of emphasis that display obvious similarities with the Sargah-sar depiction. We are actually up against a similar stylistic rendering of the feline, as well as the same position of the two animals (Fig. 18; MANP 3: pi. 103). Indeed, two vertical strokes appear on the back of the animal at Sargah-sar, followed by a faded area, most probably the legs of an anthropomorph; a third vertical line, on the left, may be what is left of an arm or an attribute. A similar depiction has been reported at Oshibat (K?nig 1994: pi. 18; 39:17 in MANP 1: pi. 20): it represents an ibex on which a figure stands, with two attributes whose nature is unclear. Another interesting example comes from Hodar and consists of the previously cited incision 103:6 (Fig. 19) (see also the wooden Durg? image from Upper Kulu valley in Diserens 1986: pi. V.b). The Sargah-sar ibex may also be compared to figure 89 at Gogdara I. It is well known that in this site the ibex is dominant, and it has been proposed that this animal may have been conceived as a manifestation of a mountain deity (Olivieri 1998: 83-84); and we have already stressed that the ibex appears together with the 'ploughed fields' ideogram both at Gogdara I and at Thalpan II. The role of the 'monkey' at Kakai-kandao 1 is an open question. A similar figure is carved at Partab Bridge (Upper Indus): the animal is represented in front of a lotus flower above a pillar standing on a basement. The carving is damaged, but apparently the animal is represented in the act of defecating (K?nig 1994: fig. 29). Interpreting the Figuration Complexes: The Giant Face of Sargah-sar All anthropomorphs, at Sargah-sar, with one or two possible exceptions, represent humans, and only 7 bear attributes (an axe or hoe, a bow, a round shield, an unidentified object standing vertically on the palm of the hand). The preserved [37] 209</page><page sequence="38">part of the complex may be subdivided into two clusters, left and right. The former, as already stated, represents the center, while the latter seems to be peripheral. Interestingly, while the main group represents a crowded, collective scene, the right hand one represents a 'hunting' scene in which an individual acts in isolation: holding a big round shield, the 'hero' faces the feline attacking the ibex (scene F) (26). Another archer, possibly another 'hunter' (2) survives in a damaged condition on the lower left (scene G). In both cases, defence and/or aggression point to the right, and are located in an outer, peripheral sphere. There might be a structural opposition between the left core, representing activities at the social core of the community, and the outer sphere, where only isolated 'heroes' or 'hunters' courageously face wild, insidious creatures (27). Let us now try to interpret the right-hand cluster in the light of the interpretations we proposed, so far, for pictograms, ideograms, and their associations. Two individuals stand in front of, and behind, the 'ploughed fields' ideogram (51) (scene A). Two couples stand in front of, and behind, another 'ploughed fields' ideogram (7) (scene B). This scene is performed by two couples, in which two individuals (one with the 'gown' or long dress, the other without) seem to be facing each other on opposite sides of the 'ploughed field' with the same tool or weapon: in this case, the impression of a male/female opposition (in agriculture?) is hardly deniable. Above, the ideogram (10), not interpreted, but observed also in a rock carving of historical age found in Ladakh (Orofino 1990: fig. 35), in syntactic associations with ideograms, and at Ghariala (Gordon 1953: pi. XXIV.&amp;). This ideogram is held up in the right hand by a lowermost actor. The rectangular center with a spiral sign (indicating an 'interior'?) may suggest that this ideogram represents some kind of building. The fourfold symmetric double crosses around possibly resembles the umbrellas of stupas, and this might be the only possible (26) Note that in rock art, in frontal schematic representations, the concept of 'in front of is often expressed by placing a figure 'below', while 'behind' is rendered by placing the object 'above'. During children's psychological development, similar approaches to the problem of graphically reproducing three-dimensionality are frequently found up to the seventh year of age. Following a classic evolutionary paradigm, various authors have stressed sets of proto-lexical or proto-syntactic similarities among the graphics of children and rock art (or 'graphic communication') expressions of pre-literate cultures. For example, Arnheim 1954 and more recently Marc &amp; Marc 1992 applied similar models in satisfactory interpretations, although in non-archaeological study contexts (Italian readers may see the bibliography in Cristiano 2002). Such a psychological approach is currently propelling the study of prehistoric art beyond the usual issues of documentation and typological-stylistic analysis (see the current approaches of E. Anati and his collaborators). One of the authors (L.M.O.), while developing his analysis of the Kandag paintings, was doubtless affected by his personal experience in the interpretation of children's graphics after some years of teaching in a primary school inspired by the pedagogy of R. Steiner (see Olivieri 2001b: 139-45). (27) Another interpretation concerning the relationship between hunting and agricultural activities could be inferred from an interesting comparison with a South Arabian amulet found in Yemen (Antonini 1996: 153). 210 [38]</page><page sequence="39">indication of such structures in the three complexes. On the other hand, the clear connection of the ideogram with a human should indicate possession, and this can hardly be the case with a buddhist cultual site. What we see in scene C may be the representation of a ritual connected with sowing: note that figure (13) has his 'sex-seed' marked with a dot, and that (15) seems to be depicted in the act of dispersing dots or seeds. Moreover, figure (19), while holding an object in his outstretched left hand, may be throwing seeds towards (20) with the other hand. In this case, note that the dot, if it were not associated with the possible 'ploughed fields' ideogram, might have been interpreted, at a more abstract level, as a simple emphasizing element. Three individuals, perhaps four, surround a 'sown fields' ideogram ('ploughed fields' + dots, i.e. 'seed') (scene C). The same ideogram (50), perhaps at the same time a symbol or standard, was drafted at the center, and connected to a human figure (scene D). Nearby, the larger anthropomorph is inserted in the larger 'sown fields' ideogram (20); here stands also another human figure (scene E). We have already interpreted the emergence of this figure from the 'sown fields' as the manifestation of a supernatural being, perhaps a divinity of agricultural land. The fact that the divinity grows out of the merging of two dotted grids possibly stresses a concept of a superior, perhaps ideal common property. Above, a chain of dancers possibly suggests the celebration of an event that, in this particular context, might well be a fertility ritual: it might be the celebration by the whole community to allow the agricultural divinity to manifest itself out of the common land (or land claimed to be such). Thus, if our analysis is correct, the left-hand cluster represents the civilized world of settlements and agricultural production, as opposed to wilderness. Squares and grids indicate 'the land of the community', 'the land of the tribe' by metonymy; it is also possible that such squares represented an identity mark, or even the standard, of the community itself. In this light, the sequence of scenes so far described possibly narrates part of an agricultural cycle: the tilling of the soil (particularly if the tool in the hands of (5) and (8) is a hoe, or an axe to be used for slashing and burning) (scenes A and B); sowing (scene C); a re-assessment of the ownership of the land (scenes D, E). Important fertility rituals involving group dancing are connected to sowing and to the celebration of a major agricultural divinity that, at a higher level of representation, emphasizes the rightful ownership of the tribe, as a whole, of its own land. We have conventionally accepted the view that type B individuals (those depicted with the lower body parts in an inverted 'U' fashion) might represent a specific part of the community, and a leading one. Type B actors appear only at Sargah-sar, clearly the most important site: they are dancers, sowers, hunters or warriors, and hold up complex symbols or elaborated standards; their image may be reflected in the anthropomorph/divinity (inside [20]). In contrast, individuals like (5) and (8), possibly holding tools used in agriculture, are marked in different ways (but we cannot exclude that this object was actually a weapon). [39] 211</page><page sequence="40">The meaning of abstract figures such as (10), (17) and (26), which most probably had immediate and important meanings for painters and onlookers, remains unclear. These figures may be associated with humans by means of body transformations - i.e. (10) to (9); (17) with (15); (26) is surrounded by a circle of dots and might have been equally relevant. We have already stressed the strong resemblance of the Sargah-sar shelter to a gigantic, supernatural human face, provided with two eyes staring at the valley, of a wide open mouth, and even of a tongue: the saddle-shaped stone surface where the ochre paint was broken up and mixed before painting. If such an explicit symbolism was actually perceived and exploited by the ancient painters, the open mouth would have gathered a true crowd of characters, symbols and concepts; the persons crushing and mixing the red pigments might have repeatedly revived, in the course of time, a living tongue capable of repeating traditional events. They might have acted as intermediaries between the supernatural giant (the same anthropomorph emerging, in the figurations, from the 'ploughed/sown fields'?) and the tribe. Painting and re? painting might have been accompanied by the retelling of old myths, and the redundancy with which dancers are depicted (see figures [45]-[49]), outside the niche-mouth might stress the ritual nature of such occasions (28). But certainly, dancing could not be performed at these sites. As we have seen, in the three shelters there is space for very small groups, say for a painter and one or two other persons. The occasions for painting and mythological narrative might have been important passage rituals centered on young individuals (similar contexts of 'use' of the paintings might be hypothesized for the shelter of Kafir-kot, less likely for Hinduano hatai and Shamo). Perhaps the task of renovating important pacts with the innermost powers of the earth and the wild world, as an individual grew up, was entrusted to a group that portrayed its members on the rock with the features of type B characters. Kakai-kandao 1 Although this shelter has only about 20 painted figures, the surviving part of the complex (presumably its core, in the most protected part of the natural niche) retains (28) A large amount of information on Australian rock painting was collected by ethnographers and anthropologists as early as the first half of the 20th century. Ritual implications of rock paintings and the selection of sacred sites connected with springs and burials, for example, have been reported by A.P. Elkin. The evidence of repeated painting and retouching is an important indicator of the ritual nature of the process. Australian hunter-gatherers, for example in northern Kimberley, by repainting at their shelters symbolically multiply the portrayed animals and plants. Similarly, paintings are touched for supernatural purposes, such as the incarnation of children's spirits in the course of fertility rituals, or the fall of rain. It is well known that some Australian caves with painted complexes are forbidden to non-initiated persons: the Sargah-sar shelter, whose limited space does not allow a large audience, might have been used in a similar way. 212 [40]</page><page sequence="41">meaningful and complex associations. The central cluster is a 'ploughed/sown fields' ideogram, with an upper appendix formed by three parallel, slightly sinuous lines (a feature previously discussed in terms of 'irrigation ducts' or as an ideogram indicating 'access', 'property'). A type D human (wearing a 'gown' or a long dress), possibly marked with a dot, could conceivably transform his or her left arm to suggest a preferential association with the dotted grid. On the right, the same 'ploughed/sown fields' ideogram might have been connected by the means of a similar appendix to the excretions of the nearby monkey, facing right, towards a small dotted square without an inner grid. This detail (the threefold appendix and the excretions) is partially faded and, as discussed above, may represent an earlier stage of figuration. The monkey might have been emphasized by a dot. Below, the same ideogram is in touch with the problematic zoomorphic depiction possibly representing either a flock of running birds in front of a spoked wheel (3) or a quadruped drawing a chariot (symbolized by the same wheel). In both cases, the wheel stands on a basement depicted as an inverted trapeze. This scene is hard to interpret, but if we compare it to Sargah-sar, we see, once more, that the core is formed by some actors (a type D human and the monkey) with preferential associations with the 'sown fields' ideograms. Leaving aside the problems of figures (4) and (3) (is the 'wheel' or 'chariot' related to 'sun' or 'sky' concepts?), such a figuration core is surrounded by a protecting circle of human figures: from the lower left in anti-clockwise direction, a type A with outstretched hands, another personage in the same posture with anomalous hands; just below, a weathered figure (12), perhaps with shield, at the bottom of the niche; another type A with outstretched arms holding a vertical object in the left; an archer with a quiver (?) facing right; another type A (?), poorly preserved, but perhaps with outstretched arms and other attributes; and finally, at the top, an embracing couple (?), with an archer (with quiver?) facing right. The syntax is clear: a set of agricultural events and/or sites is surrounded by an outer circle of characters in a protective attitude, some of whom pointing their bows to the right (the same direction, at Sargah-sar, was associated with the non-civilized world). The monkey may represent the border between civilization/agriculture and the wilderness, or might be interpreted as a shamanic personage, basically with the same meaning. Dwolasmanai-patai The same basic organization is encountered also in what remains of the complex of the third shelter. Here we have a large central abstract ideogram formed by an irregular (?) cluster of squares, dots and comb-like lines, somewhat similar to the ideogram at Sargah-sar, figure (10). Does this ideogram represent a larger agricultural landscape irregularly condensed into a vaguely anthropomorphic figure? The uppermost five-dot rosette might be an emphasizing psychogram, stressing the [41] 213</page><page sequence="42">importance of the human figures holding weapons and attributes around the hypothesized territory. Other examples of similar 'rosettes' are found in figuration complexes in Ladakh, datable to the historical period: with three petals, with seven petals with an eighth, elongated petal within a lozenge depicted above a basement, together with an ibex (Orofino 1990: figs. 32, 25). The fact that, in the preserved part, the figures point their bows to the right might suggest a defensive marshalling around the community's agricultural land (in this case, only type D individuals would be entrusted with the task); on the other hand, given the peculiarities of the dress, the posture and the bows, one cannot rule out the opposite possibility that the painting shows a foreign ethnic group attacking the community. In other words, in this latter case the outer world could not be symbolized by animals, but by enemies. Unfortunately the (albeit limited) complex that the painters depicted in the uppermost shelter, placed in the deep of a small cave (29), is missing. The Kandag Shelters, Gogdara I and Other Carvings in the Indus Valley: Comparing Syntax In the great rock carving complex of Gogdara I there is no evidence of the recurrent associations of pictograms and ideograms distinguishing the Kandag shelters. At Gogdara I, at least in the phase defined as 'mature', syntax is based upon redundant associations of single ideograms. In the 'late' phase, the carvings seem to take on a descriptive nature, completely absent in the more ancient, larger zoomorphic ideograms, but a simple pictographic value still prevails. In spite of this important difference, the Gogdara I complex and the Kandag ones apparently share some ideograms and their association trends, probably in the wake of a lexical ideographic uniformity and continuity. One suspect that the basic lexicon of the Upper Indus carvings of Karakorum has many points in common with that used by the Kandag painters, but again the syntax is different. In the Upper Indus complexes, carvings dated by the German scholars to prehistoric times (3rd-2nd millennium B.C.) are equally distinguished by elementary syntactic forms involving the redundant association of single ideograms (such is the case, for example, of Thalpan Ziyarat). Subsequently, after the flourishing of the beautiful buddhist carvings, fully reflecting the cultural milieu of a literate society, later non-buddhist carvings seem to go back to simpler associations of ideograms. We find a repetition of ideograms such as 'sun symbols', or prestigious pictograms like the 'ibex', or 'metal axe'. The most complex scenes are once again those formed by paratactic compositions, occasionally crossed by lines of association; the most conspicuous aspect, however, is the lexicon: key words such as (29) Of the three complexes so far discussed, Dwolasmanai-patai is the one we would date more confidently to a phase of the Kushana period in Swat. 214 [42]</page><page sequence="43">'outstretched fingers men', 'men with psychogrammatic dots', dots, 'sun symbols', etc.; important propositions such as 'ibex and feline'; significant associations such as body transformations associated with the wild animal world are certainly commonly found in the Kandak culture and that of the Upper Indus engravers. It is worth noting, in any case, that the two graphic contexts could be definitively and positively compared only by matching painting complexes on rock shelters with similar sites: the implications of graphics carved on large boulders along major traffic routes, in fact, could be quite different from those of our painted shelters. We have already discussed the site of Ghariala in terms of specific comparisons; interestingly, it offers relevant information for the syntax as well, as these appear somewhat similar to the Kandag paintings. The sites of Mandori, Gandab (on the right bank of the Indus), Hori and Ghariala (on the left bank) have been considered as representing a specific context of Middle Indus rock art, centered on the area of Attock Bridge (Punjab) (Gordon &amp; Gordon 1941; Gordon 1953: 111-12, pis. XXlll.a-b, XXYV.a-b). On the basis of pictographic and epigraphic details these carvings have been dated to the early historical period. In actual fact, this dating is certain for the complex at Mandori, but not for Ghariala. This latter site lacks the bullock cart pictogram recorded at Mandori, while, in contrast, its syntax involves the use of '[...] abstract symbols, some of which can be construed to be stylised human, but the majority are those to which it is always tempting, but in reality quite futile, to assign a speculative meaning [...]' (Gordon 1953: 112). One of the most important figures of Ghariala (Gordon 1953: pi. XXTV.b) shows a central association of ideograms perhaps suggesting (on the base of the Kandag evidence) a ritual event. Around this central element, one sees human figures in the act of group dancing (?); such figures also include a 'great' anthropomorph with visible body transformations. Conclusions: Absolute Chronology Looking at the rock paintings of the Swat region as a whole, the most likely dating is a late-protohistoric horizon. Painters might have continued to draw their figures on rock cliffs up to the lst-3rd century A.D., as attested by the complex of Kafir-kot, where the syntax and style do not differ noticeably from Sargah-sar. At Kafir-kot, stupas are carefully described, just as the 'warriors' or 'bowmen' were executed in detail at Dwolasmanai-patai: perhaps this graphic care depends upon the fact that these subjects had no traditional part in the ideogram-based lexicon of the painters. At Kafir-kot, as in the Kandag complexes, important actions are emphasized by points: this is the case of the pradaksina-patha (ritual procession) rendered by a circle of dots around the central stupa of the complex. Near a stupa an archer on horseback may be seen. Again at Kafir-kot, the central ideogram, already interpreted as a tribal sign, may stand as an important ideogram. Another indication of the persistence in the graphic non-literate lexicon of such ideograms is probably [43] 215</page><page sequence="44">the sub-divided or dotted squares ('buildings' and 'sown fields'?) painted at Marano-Tangai, near the ruins of the stupa at Chuwa. If the latest paintings date back to the Kushana period, how old are the earliest complexes? Indications of antiquity come from Sargah-sar, in first place the persistence of the possible cultual meaning of the ibex/feline opposition, fully identified already in the earliest phase of the Gogdara I carvings. At Gogdara I, the persons who carved the latest designs (shepherds and chariot drivers) did not deface the largest pictures of the ibex-goddess or of the leopards, and carved the linear depictions of their herds in free areas of the rocky cliff. Other possible hints of an earlier chronology at Sargah-sar are the absence of horse and stupa depictions, as well as the probable representation of stone axes, the most typical stone tool of proto-historic Swat. These stone axes - in serpentine, gneiss, granite or limestone - are in reality adzes, i.e. the cutting edge worked at a right or an oblique angle with the wooden handle (G. Stacul, personal communication): In the Swat sequence, they have been regularly found in Period IV settlement contexts (about 1800-1400 B.C.), the only specimen of a perforated 'stone axe' being a completely different tool found in a Period V layer at Aligrama (see Stacul &amp; Tusa 1977: fig. 43). Their appearance in the early 2nd millennium B.C. is conceivably related to the substantial increase in settlement and agricultural output hypothesized for the late Bronze Age of the major valleys (Stacul 1987). Also, G. Stacul suggested that forest exploitation for trading high quality timber with the protourban centers of the Indus valley was a major economic activity for the mountain communities (1998: 455). Thus, the survival of stone axes or adzes in the late protohistory of Swat, with the exception of copper (since Period IV) and iron specimens (since Period VII, around 500-400 B.C.) would be hardly surprising because stone axes or adzes would have been a vital technical element for the more isolated upland communities even in the late 1st millennium B.C., when the renewal of monumental architecture and urbanism suddenly required enormous amounts of construction timber. The earliest phases of Gogdara I have been hypothetically dated between the late Bronze Age (late 2nd millennium B.C.) and the early Iron Age, in the following centuries. If this dating is correct, the Kandag painted rock shelters might be dated, with a conservative hypothesis, to late protohistoric times: in terms of the cultural sequence established by G. Stacul for the entire Swat region, to Periods VII or VIII. This chronological range would embrace the same time span of the large cemetery of the Barikot center at the mouth of the valley. Thus, in terms of absolute chronology, our shelters would have been painted after 500 B.C. (see Stacul 1968, 1969, 1987). On the other hand, the absence of representations of metal items and horses, and the possible depiction of polished stone adzes might suggest an earlier dating; and presently there are no compelling reasons to exclude a priori a dating within the first half of the 1st millennium B.C. The horse appears in the archaeological record and in the iconography of the Swat valley around the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. (see Stacul 1987). The 216 [44]</page><page sequence="45">apparent delay with which the horse image is accepted into the rock art of Swat is compatible with the remoteness of the areas of the painted shelters, and with the evidence of ideological and aesthetic traits having very little in common with the cultures developing in the main valleys. It is also clear that such a delay or refusal of the horse depiction must have been accompanied by a basic suspicion towards one of the most prestigious symbols of protohistoric aristocratic groups acting in the more privileged core areas of the valley. In our view the Kandag paintings, together with the other examples of non buddhist rock art in Swat, may be ascribed to a wider but well defined rock art context, involving the Middle Indus, Kohistan (Gordon 1953) and the Upper Indus areas, Karakorum, the regions of Ladakh-Zanskar and western Tibet (Renmudong) (Francfort et al. 1990:5-6). Another material expression of the ideology of the same cultures may be the two aniconic stelae of Panr, probably datable to a late historical period. These monuments are not affected by the art and craftsmanship of the contemporary votive buddhist production, and still exploit associations of ideograms (30). Powerful tribes scarcely integrated with the major statal organizations and their pervasive ideologies most probably remained outside the world of the fortified centers of the Kushana leaders, the buddhist sacred areas, the Hindushahi forts. This is the other side of the history of Swat: the history of the mountain communities that were not influenced by Gandharan art or by the post-Gupta styles of vajrayana monasteries of the 7th-8th centuries A.D. Cultural and Social Implications: Beyond 'Grave Cultures' From an archaeological viewpoint, the 1st millennium B.C. is probably the least known period of the Subcontinent. In Swat, it is represented only by graves and by very limited stratigraphic clearings, usually monitored to the exposure of more (30) In autumn 1993, while studying and documenting the buddhist steles in the Swat Archaeological Museum (Filigenzi, forthcoming), the former Director of the Museum, Dr Ashraf Khan, pointed out to l.M.o. two peculiar stones or steles with unusual carvings (Fig. 20). The steles are in granitic gneiss and were found near Panr (Jambil, Swat); after being inventoried by the Italian Archaeological Mission, they were donated to the Museum. The first stone (v 504) is 85 cm long and 38 cm wide; on both faces run a single and double wavy pattern and a straight line in relief (Figs. 20-21). The second stele (v 903) is 86 cm long and 30 cm wide; its main face shows a straight line in relief, and a single incised wavy line (Fig. 20), while the opposite side shows two ridges in relief, with a terminal incised spiral-like feature turning right. The function is unknown. v 903 has a different surface patina in the part that presumably was placed in the ground. v 504 shows instead a kind of recess in the rear perhaps suggesting that the stone had been placed on a standing stone support (for example a railing). These mysterious stones may have been used in burials; another possibility is their association with fertility, as in the naga cults of southern India. [45] 217</page><page sequence="46">Fig. 20 - The stelae V504 (left) and V903 (right). (Dep. IsIAO L 17906/27; photo by L.M. Olivieri). ancient levels. In spite of the many ambiguities and problems of the interpretations we have proposed, the Kandag paintings offer a unique opportunity for asserting or hypothesizing something, even at a highly speculative level, about the protohistoric non-literate communities that produced this form of 'art' (Tusa 1979; Olivieri 1996: n. 7; see also the important Paragraph 'Writing, Language and Brain', in Dematte 1999: 242-45). Some points are clear. We are dealing with an agricultural non-migratory society, with permanent rights of property on its territory (this seems to be implied both by the meanings of property attached to the 'ploughed fields' signs, and by the evidence of repeated painting over time at the shelters). Ploughing may have been performed according to the grid-like orthogonal patterns observed during the excavations at Aligrama, in the Swat valley. Agricultural property may also have involved control over irrigation (hypothetical, but quite likely) by the means of possession of springs and mountain watercourses. Stone axes where perhaps used for tilling the soil, following slash-and-burn agricultural cycles. Oddly enough, horses are absent, and there is no emphasis on hunting or animal husbandry - bovines, in particular, are not represented - and there is no evidence of any major role played by prestigious metal 218 [46]</page><page sequence="47">goods. The only representation of an animal-drawn vehicle is doubtful (31). The community (or the sector of the population involved in the paintings and possibly in the related rituals) had a strong feeling of self awareness, both in terms of opposition toward an outer, unordered natural environment, and, possibly, towards the foreign world settled by different cultures and larger social formations. These oppositions may have been expressed, at a religious level, in the worship of a male divinity of agri? cultural land, in the core of the social Fig. 21 - The stelae V504 (back side). (Dep. IsIAO L 17917/30; photo by L.M. Olivieri). world, and, in the wild world, of a great goddess connected to the traditionally sacred figure of the ibex. As far as the male agricultural deity is concerned, if we are correct in likening the gigantic, probably sacred 'face' of Sargah-sar to that of the god, the painting of rows of dancers on it would have taken on the same symbolic value of ritually dancing on ploughed and/or sown fields. Our analysis of the rock (31) In this light, if our interpretation is correct, it opens up some interesting questions that we should like to address in a future monographic research. The 'mature' phase of Gogdara I - together with great part of the carvings of the Middle and Upper Indus - may be related to an horizon of 'evolved hunters' (in the terms of E. Anati's typology); the 'late' phase of the same monument belongs to a society of breeders; and finally the cultural context of Sargah-sar and Kakai-kandao 1 point to a semi-permanent farming society. Rock art, in other words, is believed to document a general transition from complex economies, still largely dominated by hunting, to organized husbandry and to a general adoption of agriculture, in the context of a growing representation of militarism. While in the Swat valley this sequence seems to develop with a certain degree of coherence, in other contexts, for example in the Upper Indus, 'evolved hunters' are believed to have survived until relatively recent times. There are few doubts that subsistence agriculture or horticulture has ancient roots in Swat, and it is certain that husbandry played a fundamental economic role even in the historical period. But how can we interpret the various protohistoric Periods of the archaeological sequence established by G. Stacul? For example (see Jettmar 1995: 36-37) are we right in assuming that in Period VII-VIII was still living a transhumance economy? This hypothesis might be supported by the analysis of Gogdara I, but also by the information provided by Arrianus (in the Anabasis and Indike). If so, when did agriculture definitely impose itself in the economy of Swat? What kind of relationship is there between such an event and the protohistoric culture of Sargah-sar and Kakai-kandao 1? Was there a historical relationship between the spreading of agriculture and the transformation of funerary practices? The shift to cremation was perhaps accompanied by a growing agricultural occupation of the favoured, strictly limited piedmont land surfaces? And finally: might such a transformation be illustrated by the new Kandag paintings? The preliminary hypothetical dating suggested here might well agree with a larger, if still complex and rather obscure, historical picture. [47] 219</page><page sequence="48">'shelters' sites and their possible use suggests that rock painting at such remote locations might be related of rituals marking the acquisition by the individual of fundamental roles. If we are correct in suggesting that human figures marked in different fashions represent different parts of the society, we might also envisage different roles and functions. Type B individuals, as we have stated, might have been involved in rituals as dancers, sowers, and could be hunters or warriors. Their similarity to the anthropomorphic deity, and their heroic role in the ibex/feline scene, suggest for this group a highly prestigious or dominant role: if we wish to define it concisely we can characterize them as 'men of high degree' following the evocative term coined for the native Australian medicine men by A.P. Elkin. Representation of bravery in war and aggression and ability in hunting dangerous predators by leading individuals were a major concern. Warriors, although less characterized in terms of dress and outward appearance include mostly type A representations. They use large round shields, Scythian-like bows and quivers; and, if at Sargah-sar we are not dealing with specialized agricultural tools, stone battle axes (this possibility is suggested at Kakai-kandao 1). How far these hypotheses actually reflect some form of early caste organization is obviously hard to say at present. REFERENCES Anati, E. (1976) Metodi di rilevamento e di analisi delVarte rupestre.
