Henry Morley, writing to the Secretary of the College about the  admission of women, 14 June 1872    The admission of women The movement for admitting women to UCL began with the creation of the London  Ladies’ Educational Association in 1868. This was an independent body which  organised classes for women and to which UCL Professors lectured, the  rst to do  so being Henry Morley and Carey Foster. These  rst classes in English Literature and  Physics, attended by 150 students, were very successful, and the curriculum was  extended the following year to include Geometry, Chemistry, French and Latin. It may  have been the intention from the beginning that this should lead to the opening of  regular classes to women students, but the process was very gradual. Initially the  women’s classes took place off the College’s premises; from 1871–72 all the classes  moved into College, but the Association, not the College, was the responsible agent.  Finally it became too much trouble to hold classes separately, and the Professor  of Political Economy, John Elliott Cairnes, became the  rst to lecture to a mixed  class. Edward Poynter, the  rst Slade Professor, had maintained from the time of his  appointment that women could and should be taught in the same classes as the  men – ‘except of course those for the nude model’ – and the Slade went on to play  a key part in the introduction of women to College life. As early as 1872 the Annual  Report noted with satisfaction that ‘Professor Poynter and his Assistants report that  not the slightest inconvenience has arisen from having classes composed of ladies  and gentlemen, and the of cers of the College are not aware that objections have  ever been made by any of the students to this combined instruction’. By October 1878 all the classes in the College, except those in the Faculty of  Medicine, were open to both men and women, although many were still taught in  separate groups. From 1878 women were able to study for University of London  degrees, and the London Ladies’ Educational Association, deemed to have served  its purpose, was wound up.

E. Ray Lankester was  only 27 when he took the Chair, having previously been a Fellow of Exeter College,  Oxford. He was a large man with a massive frame, a mobile, expressive face, a  booming voice and an impetuous temperament – ‘a veritable swashbuckler amongst  Professors’ (Fig. 4.9). Lankster was a dominating  gure in his subject, editing the  major zoological journal of the period for 50 years and placing his pupils in many  of the Chairs in the subject at home and across the Empire. He wrote proli cally  on a wide range of subjects including fossil  shes, molluscs and arthropods, and  in his later years on prehistory and early human history. Soon after his appointment Lankester introduced practical work into the  Zoology courses. With the exception of Huxley’s experimental courses, this was  another innovation for a British university.

E. Ray Lankester was  only 27 when he took the Chair, having previously been a Fellow of Exeter College,  Oxford. He was a large man with a massive frame, a mobile, expressive face, a  booming voice and an impetuous temperament – ‘a veritable swashbuckler amongst  Professors’ (Fig. 4.9). Lankster was a dominating  gure in his subject, editing the  major zoological journal of the period for 50 years and placing his pupils in many  of the Chairs in the subject at home and across the Empire. He wrote proli cally  on a wide range of subjects including fossil  shes, molluscs and arthropods, and  in his later years on prehistory and early human history. Soon after his appointment Lankester introduced practical work into the  Zoology courses. With the exception of Huxley’s experimental courses, this was  another innovation for a British university. Laboratory experience was increasingly  becoming an integral part of a science undergraduate’s course, and in this case  Fig. 4.9  Sir Ray Lankester, Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, 1874–91.

Its second Professor, Alphonse Legros, came from the  Parisian art world and the heart of the realist movement (Fig. 4.27). However, if  he came as a new in uence in 1876, Legros fairly soon lost touch with the latest  developments in Paris. He became an increasingly isolated  gure, speaking little  English and teaching mostly by demonstration – but the School continued to  prosper and expand in his years. Among his pupils were William Rothenstein and  Frederick Brown (Fig. 4.28), who succeeded him in 1893 and admired him as a  teacher. All the same, it is said that as Legros left UCL for the last time he muttered,  ‘Vingt ans perdus’.

The  rst really signi cant and in uential period of the Slade’s history occurred  when Frederick Brown was Professor and Henry Tonks and Wilson Steer his  assistants. It was Brown who discovered Steer’s talent as an artist and he who  persuaded Tonks (Fig. 4.29) to leave his job as a demonstrator in anatomy in a  London hospital and join the Slade. The three men were friends and all members  of the New English Art Club, the focal point of the most adventurous English artists  in the 1890s.

All the same, it is said that as Legros left UCL for the last time he muttered,  ‘Vingt ans perdus’. The College still possesses and prizes a splendid collection of  Legros’ etchings; it was not until many years after his death that he received wider  acclaim as an artist. The  rst really signi cant and in uential period of the Slade’s history occurred  when Frederick Brown was Professor and Henry Tonks and Wilson Steer his  assistants. It was Brown who discovered Steer’s talent as an artist and he who  persuaded Tonks (Fig. 4.29) to leave his job as a demonstrator in anatomy in a  London hospital and join the Slade. The three men were friends and all members  of the New English Art Club, the focal point of the most adventurous English artists  in the 1890s. At  rst they introduced the ideas of the Impressionists and later  developed their own reaction to them. At this stage the Slade was the mediator  Fig. 4.27  Alphonse Legros, Slade  Professor of Fine Art, 1875–83. Fig. 4.28 (opposite, above left)   Frederick Brown, Slade Professor,  1892–1918.
