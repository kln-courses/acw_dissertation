<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMPOSIUM ON MEANING AND TRUTH, PART III: DISCUSSION TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH When the editors of Philosophy and Phenomenological Research invited critical comment on the symposium on Meaning and Truth,' they could not have foreseen the extraordinarily varied and heavy fare of problems and ideas which those who undertook such comment would be required to digest. In any event, I do not find it possible, within the limitations of space and time prescribed for this discussion, to do justice to all the issues raised by all the symposiasts. At the cost of leaving entirely unnoticed some of the contributions to the symposium and referring to others only incidentally, I shall restrict my remarks to the papers of Professors Ducasse and Kaufmann. The cost of this restriction is high, but as the alternative to a more inclusive but more superficial discussion of the essays, it recom- mends itself to me as the lesser of two evils. I It is by no means the easiest part of a philosophical analysis to formulate the problem generating it with a precision sufficient to permit decision as to what specific issues the conclusion of the analysis is intended to resolve. In the present symposium this difficulty seems to me to have been faced more successfully in the discussions on truth than on meaning. Profes- sors Ducasse and Tarski, in particular, make it quite plain that the prob- lem of truth, as they conceive it, is that of a satisfactory definition of the terms "true" and "false." Moreover, they both recognize that these terms have a variety of usages not all compatible with one another, and that the definitions they propose are adequate for just one identifiable usage. But in spite of the fact that they are discussing what is clearly the same usage, and that they are, therefore, addressing themselves to what appears to be the same problem, their conclusions are widely divergent. An examination of Professor Ducasse's formulation of his problem will reveal why this is so. After listing several statements in which the terms "true" and "false" are employed in a recognizable way, he says: The problem ... of the nature of truth, as it concerns the kind of data just exemplified, is .. . simply that of discovering a definition of the adjectives "true" and "false" that will "fit" the sort of use made of them in statements of the type illustrated. Furthermore, to say that a given definition of, for instance, "true" fits that use means that the definiens can be substituted for the word "true" in all such statements without thereby altering the truth- value . .. of those statements ...

The first involves what is perhaps only a minor point, but I state it because of its bearing on the subsequent discussion. It is not clear how seriously one is to take the suggestion that the sole condition which a definition of "true" must satisfy is that the statements which are the results of replacing "true" by the definiens have the same truth-value as the statements from which they have been obtained. This condition appears to be too weak. Sup- pose, for example, that the term "man" were equated by some proposed definition with the term "featherless biped." Since, as a matter of contingent fact men, and men only, are featherless bipeds, Professor Ducasse's condi- tion for a definition "fitting" a usage would be satisfied-provided, of course, that the statements containing the term "man" are extensional with respect to their predicates. I suspect, however, that Professor Ducasse would nevertheless not regard the proposed definition as satis- factory. I think he would insist that the corresponding statements ob- tained by eliminating the term "man" in favor of the proposed definiens must be logically equivalent, and not merely equivalent with respect to their truth-values. My second remark has a more direct bearing on the reasons for the diver- gence between the analyses of Professors Ducasse and Tarski. The former does not state explicitly what sort of terms are candidates for being con- stituents of the definition of "true," so that as a consequence his readers cannot tell what his actual problem is, except as a conjectural inference from the result finally reached. This serious defect characterizes not only Professor Ducasse's discussion, but also the essays of Professors Kaufmann and Urban. In this matter Professor Tarski is a model of clarity. He states explicitly that his object is to define "true," when used as an ad- jective of sentences, with the help of certain semantical notions such as "fulfillment" and "satisfaction." It follows that Professor Tarski is in no way concerned with arriving at "criteria" of truth, and that his discussion is singularly free from preoccupation with the issues involved in the question as to how we come to know true propositions. Indeed, as he explicitly notes, the semantical definition of "true" which he proposes is completely neutral with respect to the various standpoints in traditional epistemology. Professor Ducasse, on the other hand-and the same must be said about Professor Kaufmann-is only incidentally concerned with giving a formally correct definition of "true" on the basis of a carefully delimited set of terms. Heis primarily interested in a theory of knowledge, and in giving a definitions of "true" which will be in consonance with his theory. For as will presently appear, Professor Ducasse defines "true" and "false" as adjectives of propositions (sharply distinguished by him from sentences), with the help of the quasi-psychological terms "believable" and "disbelievable." Ac-</page><page sequence="3">52 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH cordingly, in examining his views I must consider both his explicit definitions of "true" and "false," and his conception as to what constitutes a criterion of true propositions. (a) Since Professor Ducasse's definitions are stated in terms of "belief" and "disbelief," I must recall to the reader what these terms signify. A belief, according to him, is the maximum degree of positive inclination to- ward a proposition, a disbelief the minimum degree of negative inclination -both types of inclination being psychological attitudes. Moreover, it is essential to bear in mind how the word "proposition" is employed by him. A proposition is neither a sentence, statement, nor judgment; it is any pair of entities "consisting of a locus and a quale" which are "capable of serving as subject and predicate in a judgment" (p. 321). But in spite of his con- cern to make clear what he takes propositions to be, I find his account of their status elusive. On the one hand, they are defined in terms of the functions their constituents may play in judgments; on the other hand, they are the objectives of judgments, and they appear to have some sort of being quite independent of judgments and of symbolism in general. I agree with Professor Ducasse that there is a well-founded distinction be- tween propositions and sentences. But is the hypostasis of propositions as self-subsisting entities the inevitable consequence of recognizing such a distinction? I will not go over thrice-familiar ground by calling attention to the difficulties which such a hypostasis must face. I suspect that it is in the interest of meeting some of them that he takes the view that true propositions are identical with facts (e. g., the fact of there being another side to the moon is identical with the true proposition that the moon has another side). However, I have not been able to ascertain what status false propositions possess in Professor Ducasse's ontology. It is the respect- able tradition in philosophy to postulate a realm of subsistence populated by propositions; but I own to some disappointment that in the age-long controversy over the "reality" of propositions Professor Ducasse appears on the side of the angels. Professor Ducasse takes the view that the sentence "Quadruplicity drinks procrastination" represents a proposition which is absurd (or neces- sarily false) but not "meaningless." Is it correct to infer, by parallel reasoning, that he holds the sentence "The class of all classes not members of themselves is a member of itself" expresses a proposition which is both true and false? If it is correct to infer this, it is not clear how he overcomes this well-known antimony. But however this may be, his definitions of "true" and "false" are as follows: "The truth . .. of a proposition consists in ultimate undisbelievabil- ity of the proposition; and falsity, in ultimate unbelievability in it" (p. 336). And he goes on to say that ultimate undisbelievability and ultimate un-</page><page sequence="4">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH 53 believability are properties of propositions-powers or capacities which are sometimes exercised and sometimes latent. "Ultimate undisbelievability or unbelievability-whether at a given moment manifest or latent-are thus properties of propositions just as corrosiveness, i.e., capacity to corrode certain things, is a property of some acids" (p. 338). These definitions appear to me as not free from a number of defects, quite apart from the issue concerning the nature or status of propositions. "True" and "false" are said to denote certain capacities of propositions, capacities specified in terms of certain activities propositions may call forth. If I have understood Professor Ducasse, the activities are those of ultimate belief and ultimate disbelief. But he does not explain whose be- liefs and disbeliefs he has in mind, nor does he shed much light on what he understands by the qualification "ultimate." Are the beliefs and disbeliefs those which actually existing human beings are capable of manifesting, or those which may be exhibited by any creatures whatsoever, whether existing now, in the past or in the future, and whether they are human, infra-human, or angelic? May the beliefs be acquired in any manner whatsoever, or are there some implicit reservations concerning the circum- stances of their occurrence? A belief is a psychological attitude, and the attitude may be engendered in many ways. There seems nothing absurd in the supposition that by an appropriate manipulation of causal conditions, individuals may be induced to hold certain beliefs permanently, for example through the exercise of hypnosis. If a proposition is permanently not disbelieved under such circumstances, is this a sign of its truth? And what is one to say if the same proposition is ultimately disbelieved by some in- dividuals and ultimately not disbelieved by others? The only indication Professor Ducasse gives of what he understands by "ultimate," is the brief statement that it refers to "whatever time decisive evidence as to their truth-value may be in and have been grasped" (p. 337). But since "de- cisive evidence" must presumably be defined in terms of truth, this explana- tion does not go very far to clarify the proposed definition of "true." Thus far I have been calling attention to obvious sins of omission in Professor Ducasse's account of truth. There are also less obvious ones. If "true" and "false" denote capacities, it is clear that propositions may possess them even though the activities to which the capacities correspond are not actually manifested. On the other hand, it is essential that the activities in terms of which those capacities are defined should be capable of realization. Would it be of any significance, for example, to attribute a power to an object, if that power can in fact never be actualized? Thus, one might assert that water at 500 C has the power of speech, with the proviso that this power is manifested when water at that temperature be haves in accordance with Boyle's law. But such amputations of capacities</page><page sequence="5">54 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH would constitute no more than a verbal game. Now my point is that Professor Ducasse has not shown that the activities of ultimate undisbelief and ultimate disbelief are in fact realizable activities. It does not seem to me logically absurd to suppose that with respect to at least some proposi- tions cognizing creatures may be incapable of manifesting such activities. Indeed, Professor Ducasse's discussion of degrees of inclination toward propositions suggests the possibility that some propositions may evoke ultimate dubitance, an exact intermediary between belief and disbelief. I am not, of course, asserting that there are any propositions which do have such capacity. I am calling attention to the fact that Professor Ducasse has not shown that there are no such propositions, and that on his definitions of "true" and "false" it appears to be a factual, contingent question whether every proposition is either true or false. This brings me to my final point. If P is any proposition, then on the customary usage of "true" and "false" the statement "P is either true or false" expresses a necessary truth. If we replace these terms by Professor Ducasse's definitions, we obtain the statement: "P is either ultimately un- disbelievable or ultimately unbelievable." Does this sentence express a necessary truth? It is not obvious that it does, since the terms "ulti- mately undisbelievable" and "ultimately unbelievable" are not obviously exhaustive of the logical possibilities. Indeed, as already suggested, the sentence "P is neither ultimately undisbelievable nor ultimately unbeliev- able" expresses what is at best only a contingently false proposition. Since I think Professor Ducasse would agree that the necessity of a proposition must be preserved under replacement of its terms by their definitions, he must also agree that his proposed definitions of "true" and "false" are not adequate to one of the tasks for which he has shaped them. (b) I now turn to Professor Ducasse's discussion of criteria of truth. I must confess at the outset that I am puzzled to know what he is looking for when he looks about not merely for a "criterion" of truth but for an "ultimate criterion." The use of criteria is familiar enough in mathematics and the positive sciences, and it will be well to examine such use first. The vanishing of the discriminate of a quadratic equation is usually said to be a criterion for the equality of its roots; for the vanishing of the discriminant is a sufficient condition for the roots being equal. On the other hand, the proposition that transcendental numbers are those numbers which are ob- tainable from a denumerable set of algebraic ones with the help of Cantor's "diagonal procedure," is usually not regarded as supplying a criterion for the former, even though it states a sufficient condition for transcendental numbers. Why is the sufficient condition in the first example taken to provide a criterion while the sufficient condition in the second example is not? The answer seems to be that in the first case the sufficient condition</page><page sequence="6">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH 55 is associated with a definite rule, such that if the rule is applied it is possible to ascertain in a relatively small number of "steps" whether the condition is satisfied; in the second example, the sufficient condition is not associated with such a rule, and we in fact possess no completely general criterion (in the sense suggested) for transcendental numbers. An analogous concep- tion lies behind the use of "criteria" in the positive sciences. Thus, the fact that blue litmus paper turns red when placed into an acid provides a criterion for acidity; for the occurrence of the color change is a sufficient condition for the acidity of a liquid, and there is a simple rule of procedure associated with the use of litmus paper which enables one to decide quite readily whether the indicated color change does occur. It is, however, less easy to specify a clear sense for "ultimate criterion," and several alter- nate interpretations for it suggest themselves. The phrase may denote nothing more than a criterion (in the sense already suggested); or a criterion which provides a necessary as well as a sufficient condition; or the only criterion which happens to be available; or a criterion whose use is required in the application of every other criterion. I do not think there is an established usage for the phrase. I can only conjecture whether Professor Ducasse uses the word "criterion" in the sense suggested above, though there are some indications to support the supposition that he does. He submits the coherence, correspondence, pragmatic, and verifiability theories of truth to a searching critique, and concludes that none of them supply criteria sufficient to establish the truth of propositions. For according to him, all these theories are caught up in a fatal infinite regress, as a consequence of their refusal to admit that "at some time" it is "directly evident" that a proposition is true. On the other hand, he offers less help to his readers concerning the meaning he associates with the phrase "ultimate criterion," and they are free to interpret it as they please. My own hypothesis is that he means to denote by it a unique criterion which is involved in applying any other criterion for testing the truth of a proposition. But about one point there can be no doubt. Professor Ducasse explicitly asserts that "self-evidence" is "the ultimate criterion of truth" (p. 329). Professor Ducasse is thus overtly committed to the Neo-Cartesian view that there is such a thing as immediate, incorrigible knowledge of at least some propositions. He is not unaware of the difficulties which the doctrine of self-evident propositions faces. But I have not been able to satisfy myself that he has outflanked these difficulties, and it is my next object to show that his defense of the "self-evidence theory of truth" is not conclusive. (1) Professor Ducasse maintains that unless some propositions are capable of being immediately known, no propositions can be known in- directly or inferentially from evidence. The argument for this claim is</page><page sequence="7">56 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH familiar. It points out that when a proposition is known on the basis of indirect evidence, we must know the propositions which constitute the evidence; and if the evidential propositions are also known only indirectly, we must know the evidential propositions which are advanced for the previous ones; but on pain of an infinite regress, we must finally arrive at propositions which are known directly or immediately. But the argument does not seem to me water-tight, and seems to confuse two distinct issues. The first of these involves what appears to me as the thoroughly sound point that we do on occasions possess the truth and that we can discover it by inquiry. I believe the argument to be sound which insists that unless we did possess knowledge of true propositions at some time, we could not intelligibly assert that we are ever in error, we could not institute inquiries into the truth of any propositions, and we could not significantly submit and evaluate evidence to test the conclusions of such inquiries. I also think that if knowledge of true propositions is to be achieved, it must be achieved as the end-product of a finite cognitive process. Most of us know, for example, that the earth is spherical in shape, that Roosevelt has been in office longer than any previous president of the U. S., or that ice floats on water. These propositions are the outcome of reflections and in- quiries which did not begin infinitely long ago. Accordingly, those who deny that we do know such things, seem to me to use the word "knowledge" in some esoteric sense, with the consequence that no one can properly be said to know anything whatever. I think this is an absurd way of using language. The second issue to which reference was made is that some propositions are self-evident and that some propositions must be known immediately. This point must not be confounded with the previous one; it is a quite distinct point and does not seem to me to follow from the first one. Proposi- tions which we claim to know and which are asserted as true, may be the conclusions of prior inquiries; or they may be the fruits of habits of ob- serving and interpreting directly experienced sensory material. But in neither case, so it appears to me, are the propositions validly assertible without the sanctions provided by our commerce with things which is more inclusive than an instantaneous, immediate experience of them. This is obvious in the case of propositions which are the termini of previous inquiries; but I think it is no less the case for propositions which are ob- tained through sensory observation. Thus, before glancing out of my window just now, I did not know that a sparrow was resting on the sill; I do know this to be the case after performing this simple operation. But although my recognizing the indicated fact consumed next to no time, the evidence for the fact is only partly constituted by what I directly experience</page><page sequence="8">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH 57 when I turn my eyes toward the window.2 I have become expert in in- terpreting swiftly such things as certain colors, sounds, and motions as signs of living birds, and I am therefore tacitly relying upon various un- iformities in the behavior of things when I make judgments of perception. It is certainly legitimate to analyze the process of acquiring knowledge into a continuous series of momentary states, with a view to discovering what, if anything, each such state contributes to the outcome of the pro- cess. But we are committing the fallacy of division if we conclude that any such state must, therefore, be an instance of knowledge. I feel fairly certain that Professor Ducasse would not argue that because the motion of a heavy sphere rolling on a floor can be analyzed into a continuous series of instantaneous states of rest, such instantaneous states are each a case of motion and any corresponding point on the floor must be capable of supporting by itself the weight of the entire sphere. Why does he argue in such a manner when it comes to the analysis of knowledge? (2) Professor Ducasse maintains that however we may come to know a proposition, the process of coming to know it must be consummated in a "last step" which "must consist of a change of some kind in our own im- mediate consciousness." It is in this last step that he locates the ultimate 2 This point is made in other ways and for other purposes by both Professors Kauf- mann and Urban in their contributions to this symposium. If I understood Professor Urban's views more clearly I would call him in to support several of my other doubts concerning Professor Ducasse's theses. His recognition of the intimate dependence of propositions upon symbolic phenomena, his consequent refusal to hypostasize propositions as self-subsistent entities, and his emphasis upon discourse as the matrix within which truth and meaning are to be located, appear to make him my natural ally in these matters. However, I am not at all sure in what sense he really affirms such statements. I can find no justification for his tacit assumption that there is one generic sense of "true," of which all senses of the word are special instances- whether the word is used in the sciences, in the arts, or in moral theory. I cannot make out what he means by "authentication," and in particular whether it refers to a process of verification as practiced in the sciences or whether it simply covers the assumption of some peculiar intuitive faculty. I think the "paradox" from which he develops his dialectic of meaning and truth is easily resolved without the dialectic. But in any case, I can make no intelligible sense of the conclusion of that dialectic, according to which "ultimately the two notions of meaning and truth coincide" and "all meaningful propositions qua meaningful are ipso facto true" (p. 390). It is obviously meaningful to suppose, for example, that all bodies attract each other as the hundredth power of the distance between them, or that Beethoven wrote more symphonies than did Haydn; but we know, nevertheless, that these propositions are false. Professor Urban must be aware as I am that the conclusion of his dialectic, if understood in the ordinary signification of the words he uses, is therefore false. But since he must be presumed not to be asserting as true what he knows to be false, I must conclude that he is asserting the conclusion-and perhaps most of his other claims-in a sense which he has not made plain to me.</page><page sequence="9">58 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH criterion of truth. "Only some state of consciousness can be the ultimate criterion of the truth or falsity of any proposition we may come to know to be true or to be false" (p. 335). The "clear, immediate, specific experience" which constitutes the ultimate criterion of truth is the experience called "belief." But precisely in what way does the occurrence of a belief provide a criterion for the truth of a proposition? Professor Ducasse would doubtless agree that in general the occurrence of a belief is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the truth of the proposition which is believed: for propositions may be true without being believed, and false even though they are believed to be true. It is plausible to maintain that if one knows a proposition P then one believes P; and also that if one knows P then P is true. But surely nothing follows from these premisse which would entitle us to assert that if one believes P, then P is true. However, Professor Ducasse maintains that when the proposition P which is being believed is "that we are having a certain clear immediate experience," knowing that P is true "consists in occurrence of that very experience" (p. 336). But I do not find the reasoning cogent. Certainly, the proposition P would not be true if the indicated experience did not occur. Nevertheless, it does not follow from this admission that if the experience does occur, the one who has the experience must know that it does occur; for example, I may have the immediate experience of seeing a color without knowing that I have the experience. Professor Ducasse may of course reply that he is using the word "know" in such a way as to cover any case of a direct, immediate experience; and in this usage of the word believing P would imply that we know P, and therefore that P is true. But if this is really his view, I sub- mit that an obvious paraphrase of his own strictures against the corre- spondence theory of truth is applicable to himself. For if the occurrence of an immediate experience is identical with the truth of the proposition that the experience does occur, by calling such an occurrence a "criterion" for the truth of the proposition he is simply asserting the tautology that a pro- position is true if and only if it is true. Is he then offering us a theory of truth which provides a criterion of truth-in any sense of "criterion" which does not identify the criterion with the truth itself? (3) Some of the issues just traversed are placed into a sharper focus by Professor Ducasse's discussion of evidence. He distinguishes three cate- gories of-the evident: the indirectly evident, the directly evident, and the self-evident. He illustrates the directly evident as follows: "The truth of the proposition that the color I intuit as I look at the letters on this page, and the color I intuit as I look at the spaces between the letters, appear to me different is perfectly evident to me; that is, it is known by me beyond all possibility of error" (p. 338). The proposition mentioned, though directly</page><page sequence="10">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH 59 evident, is not self-evident; it is not self-evident because there is a positive answer to the question "What is the evidence or criterion of its truth?" The answer is that "when I try to disbelieve that proposition, even then I still believe it completely" (p. 339). The criterion for the truth of a directly evident proposition therefore seems to consist in the sheer persist- ence of the belief in it when one tries to alter it. The proposition is ulti- mately warranted not by the fact that the intuited colors are different, but by the quite different fact that one continues to believe they are different. Professor Ducasse thus falls back upon a purely psychological datum to guarantee the truth of "directly evident" propositions. I am afraid I can- not imagine what cogent reply he can make to the obvious and (as it ap- pears to me) fatal objection that the occurrence of psychological attitudes of inclination toward propositions may provide evidence for the biographies of those who display such attitudes, but no relevant evidence concerning the objects toward which such inclinations are directed. Thus far I have been considering Professor Ducasse's criterion for directly evident but not self-evident propositions. The criterion for directly evi- dent propositions is the persistence of beliefs in them in spite of attempts to alter them. But what if one asks for evidence that such beliefs do occur? Professor Ducasse's reply is that the "occurrence of belief is its own evidence ... .This, moreover, is the only case where truth consists in belief and belief constitutes truth (not, is direct or indirect evidence of truth). That is, this is the only case of, self-evidence strictly so called" (p. 339). Ac- cordingly, the ultimate criterion of truth-the criterion of self-evident propositions-is simply the occurrence of belief. There are three sets of comments I wish to make in this connection. In the first place, Professor Ducasse does not provide a general criterion of truth; the occurrence of belief which constitutes the ultimate criterion is only good for propositions affirming a belief to occur. But in what sense is the criterion "ultimate"? It is certainly not ultimate in the sense that it is or must be employed whenever any proposition is being tested for its truth. Consider for example, the proposition that ice floats on water. I believe this proposition to be true, and I can indicate some of the evidence which serves to establish it as true: the proposition is confirmed by various observations on ice and water, and it also follows from certain well-known propositions in physics concerning densities and buoyancies. But neither the evidential propositions nor the evaluation of the evidence involves the proposition that I or anyone else hold certain beliefs. Accordingly, there is no relevant way in which Professor Ducasse's ultimate criterion enters into the determination of the truth of the proposition in question. In the second place, if the occurrence of belief is the ultimate criterion for the truth of the proposition that belief occurs, wvhy does not Professor</page><page sequence="11">60 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Ducasse also hold that the occurrence of a war is the ultimate criterion for the truth of the proposition that the war occurs, that the striking of a clock is the ultimate criterion for the proposition that the clock is striking, and so on for any pair of occurrences and the corresponding propositions about them? He cannot reply merely by declaring that in these cases the occur- rences are not "directly" apprehended by us; for the occurrence of a clock's striking the hour, for example, appears to be just as accessible to direct apprehension as the occurrence of a belief. He must be tacitly assuming that self-observation is in some fashion more reliable and more certain than observation of non-psychic events. But such an assumption, if he really does make it, is not supported by any credible empirical evidence; indeed, the available evidence points in the contrary direction. I suspect, more- over, that Professor Ducasse overlooks one important point in the logic of evidence-a point which seems to me to cut the ground from under the Cartesian search for ultimate grounds of certitude. It simply is not the case that the logical certitude which may be attached to a proposition can be no greater than the warrant for any piece of evidence supporting it. Accordingly, even if one were to admit for the sake of the argument that we are more certain of the occurrence- of our beliefs than of anything else, it does not follow that this certainty is a consequence of the self-evi- dence of propositions about our beliefs. The certainty may be the conse- quence of the fact that a large number of independent propositions about non-psychic events support it. Finally, one must recall that on Professor Ducasse's definition of "true," the truth of a proposition consists in its capacity to be ultimately undisbe- lieved. But as he himself notes, a capacity is "a respect of invariance through time, and has no date" (p. 331), so that truth is a property which some propositions possess, irrespective of time, to cause a certain sort of effect. He cannot, therefore, be right when he maintains in connection with the ultimate criterion of truth that "truth consists in belief and be- lief constitutes truth." For a belief, unlike the capacity of being true, has a date, and is not necessarily invariant through time. He may claim to have some grounds for maintaining that the occurrence of some beliefs is a sufficient condition for the property of ultimate undisbelievability in the propositions to which those beliefs are directed. But he cannot maintain, on pain of contradiction if not of complete incoherence, that the suffi- cient condition for that property is identical with the property itself. II Professor Kaufmann's discussion of the problem of truth is based on his analysis of the logic of scientific procedure. I shall therefore begin with a consideration of the latter, partly because of the light his analysis throws</page><page sequence="12">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH 61 on his conception of truth, and partly because of the intrinsic interest of his views on scientific method. I will say at once that I find myself in great sympathy with his attempt to reconcile the conflicting claims of traditional rationalism and empricism, and that I am in considerable agreement with some of the positions he develops. On the other hand, though perhaps only a hair's breadth divides us, I find many of his emphases disturbing and his silence on some fundamental issues puzzling. If Professor Ducasse may be regarded as the protagonist of a modernized Descartes, Professor Kaufmann may be viewed as the defender of a Kant sans Kant's transcen- dental psychology. And if for Professor Ducasse all cognition must rest on absolutely indubitable, self-evident truths, for Professor Kaufmann the validity of our claims to have knowledge must be judged in terms of the system of a priori rules of scientific procedure. Professor Kaufmann's general position thus seems to me as extreme in one direction as Professor Ducasse's is in the other. He does little to show in what way the regulative principles of procedure are anchored in the trial-and-error attempts of men to arrive at competent knowledge of the world, and his formulations give some support to the suspicion that for him all facts are completely defined by the methods we happen to use in investigating them. Moreover, as will soon be apparent, there is also some ground for believing that he would reject the claim that we can ever be rightly said to have knowledge of any- thing; and if this interpretation of his views does not misrepresent him, the consequence is a disastrous skepticism. I am by no means confident that I understand where Professor Kaufmann stands on these matters. The following discussion is, therefore, primarily an indication of points in his views which I have found obscure. (a) According to Professor Kaufmann, the primary task of methodology is to clarify the distinction between correct and incorrect scientific deci- sions. A scientific decision is one which decides the status of a proposition with respect to its inclusion into or exclusion from the corpus of accepted knowledge. His fundamental thesis is that a "correct decision" is defined in terms of the "implicitly presupposed rules of scientific procedure" (p. 267). On his view, therefore, any issue concerning the relevance or sufficiency of evidence for a given proposition is adequately formulated only if explicit reference is made to the procedural rules in terms of which evidence is evaluated. He declares, for example, that "a proposition is empirically valid if it has been accepted into, and then retained in, a science in accordance with the implicitly presupposed rules of scientific procedure" (p. 268). These "presupposed rules" include, among others, the method- ological principle of sufficient reason (i.e., grounds must be supplied for any decision which alters the status of a proposition) and the principle of permanent control (i.e., every accepted proposition is subject to a poten-</page><page sequence="13">62 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH tially endlesss criticism). He believes, furthermore, that the question whether a given scientific decision is correct or not can be resolved without any reference to "facts qua actual." For if by "the scientific situation at a time" we understand the totality of propositions accepted at that time, then according to him such a question can be answered "in terms of the rules of procedure on the basis of the given scientific situation"; in brief, "the answer is provided by logical analysis of the rules of procedure" (p. 271). Several difficulties in this account must now be considered. (1) If the correctness of a scientific decision is defined by the implicity presupposed rules of procedure, it is obviously important to determine just what an "implicitly presupposed" rule is. The phrase suggests that Professor Kaufmann does not think that all the rules of procedure are explicitly form- ulated, and that they do not serve as explicitly accepted principles for mak- ing scientific decisions. Unfortunately, he does not explicitly say what it is for a rule to be implicitly presupposed. Is it a rule which a scientist would formulate if he were asked to give reasons for accepting or rejecting a proposition? But it is well-known that most scientists would be embar- rassed by such a request, and many of them if pressed for an answer would state quite silly rules. Is it a principle which "warrants" or "justifies" a scientific decision? But for Professor Kaufmann questions of warrant can only be answered in terms of pre-supposed rules, and this line of querry leads in the direction of an infinite regress. Is it a generalized description of what scientists actually do when they carry on their inquiries and make their decisions? Professor Kaufmann explicitly rejects this possibility. For according to him, the implicitly presupposed rules are "the criteria in terms of which scientists distinguish between correct and incorrect scien- tific decisions." Scientists do not always comply with these rules, but such "aberrations leave their validity untouched" (p. 277). Are the rules form- ulations of these procedures which have proved themselves successful in attaining the objectives of inquiry? This is not a possible interpretation either, for according to Professor Kaufmann "success" and "degrees of suc- cess" are themselves defined in terms of "presupposed preference rules." Are they proposals to conduct inquiry in one way rather than another? But whether they are or not, what is the source of authority of the rules, whence do they derive their normative powers? Professor Kaufmann's silence on this crucial issue does not help to remove the puzzlement of his readers. (2) There are other ways than those characteristic of modern natural science by which men have attempted to obtain intellectual and practical mastery over the processes of nature. Magic, astrology, numerology, and clairvoyance are some of the enterprises through which men have tried,</page><page sequence="14">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH 63 and still try, to achieve these ends. In all of them certain explicit rules govern the procedures involved in them, and I imagine Professor Kaufmann would be able to discover many implicitly presupposed rules as well. But if the correctness of a scientific decision is relative to the rules of procedure, in each of these enterprises there will be correct decisions relative to the corresponding rules. How then is one to distinguish between "correct decisions" which represent a genuine achievement in knowledge, and "correct decisions" which simply contribute to a pseudo-science? I do not see how, in terms of his analysis, Professor Kaufmann can even admit such a distinction, to say nothing of being in the position to answer the query. For by relativizing all questions of the correctness of decisions to specified rules of procedure, it is difficult to see how the adoption of one system of rules rather than another can be anything but arbitrary. It seems to me that Professor Kaufmann has underemphasized if not neglected the criteria which specific problems provide in determining whether a given scientific decision is correct or not. For if a problem is specified and a procedure is adopted in order to resolve it, then whether a proposed answer yielded by that procedure is adequate or not can be judged in terms of whether it does solve the problem. And however "correct" a decision may be when eval- uated in terms of some conceivable system of rules, it will be incorrect if it fails to contribute to the resolution of the problem. The correctness of a given decision, in this obvious and fundamental sense of "correctness," is not in general capable of being determined by using an antecedent system of rules, but only in the light of the conclusions of the inquiry. Does Pro- fessor Kaufmann really mean to maintain anything different? If he does not, I think that his exclusive emphasis upon the conformity of "correct decisions" to "implicitly presupposed rules" hides from his readers his true intent. (3) In this connection it is worth examining the claim that when a speci- fic scientific situation is assumed, the correctness of any scientific decision relative to that situation can be decided entirely by a "logical analysis" of the rules of procedure. This is at best an idle claim, if the rules are only "implicitly presupposed." For how is one to ascertain what rules are to be analyzed if the rules are not explicitly formulated? However, the im- portant point to note is that Professor Kaufmann assumes the rules to be complete, so that every decision can be established as correct or not simply by appealing to them. He draws upon a legal analogy to illustrate his con- tention. He declares that in the decisions of a judical court "the process of fact-finding can be strictly separated from the analysis of the legal norms by which it is proved that a particular legal decision on the basis of those facts is in conformity with the norms" (p 271). I think, however, that instead of supporting his contention, the analogy tends to undermine it.</page><page sequence="15">64 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH For it is demonstrable that in general there is no antecedent set of norms which, given the facts, uniquely determines a court's decision. The study of legal procedure has yielded ample evidence to show that norms or rules of legal conduct are frequently instituted by the court's very decision. It is therefore misleading to suggest that courts simply expound the law and never make it. It is no less misleading to declare that, given a body of accepted knowledge, analysis of the rules of procedure will suffice to de- termine whether a given scientific decision is correct or not. Certainly it is only by a proleptic use of the world "rule" that one can make out a plausible case for the view to which Professor Kaufmann subscribes. I am not dis- puting for a moment that there always are some rules which guide both scientific and legal decisions. I am disputing what I take to be the implied content of Professor Kaufmann's claim, that the meaning of "correct- ness" which is relevant to the actual enterprise of modern science must be specified exclusively in terms of a complete set of a prior rules. Because of his concern to stress the systematic rationality of science he seems to me to have slighted the point recently made by Max Born when the latter de- clared that in science "we are in a jungle and find our way by trial and error, building our road behind us as we proceed. We do not find sign-posts at crossroads, but our own scouts erect them, to help the rest." Professor Kaufmann recognizes that not only may the status of proposi- tions concerning the subject-matter of a science change, but that the rules of procedure may also be altered in the course of inquriy. One naturally expects, therefore, that one's doubts about these rules would finally be resolved by his discussion of the grounds for this alteration of the rules. This expectation is not realized, for he has nothing more clarifying to say than that the "correctness" of a decision to change the rules of procedure is again defined in terms of rules of procedure of a higher order. These latter rules include what he calls "preference rules determining the criteria of success"-preference rules being "all those rules by which an order of prefer- ence between procedures in relation to given problems or an order of signif- icance of problems is established" (p. 273). He notes in this context that the conformity of predictions with observations is not the only criterion of success, for other criteria are also employed which refer to such "theoretical ideals" as the unity, simplicity, and exactness of knowledge. Moreover, he makes the important point that the testing of a prediction by observa- tion is not simply a "confrontation of an assumption with the 'immediately given"'; on the contrary, the data of observation are said to be already "formed," presumably by various theoretical and methodological principles of inquiry (p 274). In spite of the fact that Professor Kaufmann explicitly rejects the stand- point of "extreme conventionalism," it is difficult to see clearly just where</page><page sequence="16">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH 65 his own position differs from it. If the "correctness" of any decision to alter the rules of procedure is defined in terms of other rules, and if obser- vational evidence is also always the product of interpreting the materials of sense in terms of "presupposed rules," all inquiry appears to move entirely within the ambit of rules whose source and authority remain unexplained. I believe Professor Kaufmann to be right in rejecting the view that there must be an "ultimate," absolutely indubitable point of support for our knowledge of things. But I also think he gives the impression that for him the rules of procedure are not simply competent instruments for discovering what the facts are, but provide exhaustive definitions of what are the facts. It is certainly important to recognize the selective character of inquiry, and to realize the function of ideas and ideals in the determination of what is the case. But it is no less important to insist that the validity of ideas and the authority of a method are derived from the contributions they make to the specific objectives of inquiry into identifiable subject-matter, and that the latter is neither created nor defined by our ideas or methods. Professor Kaufmann's brief but highly interesting discussion of empirical and theoretical laws also bears the stamp of an ambiguous conventionalism. Although he gives no specific examples of such laws, his remarks suggest that he considers Galileo's law for freely falling bodies to be an empirical law, while the Newtonian laws of motion and gravitation are theoretical ones. An empirical law is said to be a universal synthetic proposition, which is capable of being falsified by a single negative instance; a theoretical law is characterized as an "idealization,'' a ''convention,'' or a "definition,' and is not capable of such falsification. There is, I admit, an important difference between such laws as that of Galileo, and the comprehensive principles which constitute theories. But I am not convinced that the dis- tinction between them is to be drawn as Professor Kaufmann draws it. In the first place, it is questionable whether even empirical laws are falsi- fiable by a single negative instance-unless, indeed, a "negative instance" is defined as one which does falsify a law. Thus, if Galileo's law is taken strictly, it is well-known that even observations on bodies falling in a vacuum are not in precise agreement with what the law asserts, and from one point of view these deviations may be regarded as instances of the failure of the law. Nonetheless, these deviations are not taken to falsify the law, because a theory of errors of observation is involved in the use of the law. Moreover, propositions like "The density of water at a given tempera- ture is constant," are ordinarily taken to be empirical laws. But this law asserts that there is one and only one value for the density of every sample of water at that temperature; and it therefore is evident that since the law involves the use of both universal and existential quantifiers it cannot, strictly speaking, be refuted by a single contrary instance.</page><page sequence="17">66 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH In the second place, I doubt the accuracy as well as the wisdom of the characterization of theoretical laws as "more or less specific rules of scien- tific procedure" (p. 276). If they were simply rules of procedure, their explicit subject-matter would be other propositions asserted or entertained in inquiry and possibly also the behavior of scientists engaged in inquiry. But certainly in their usual formulations the Newtonian laws of motion (or, for that matter, any other theory in physics) make no mention of either propositions or scientific behavior. I agree with Professor Kauf- mann that one of the functions of theories is to indicate to inquirers what lines of analysis are to be undertaken when certain types of problems re- quire solution; but empirical laws also have this function, even though the scope of their relevant application is more restricted. Moreover, by de- scribing theoretical laws as definitions, Professor Kaufmann once more obscures the empirical, factual content they possess and upon which their acceptance rests. Although he denies that the acceptance of theoretical laws is arbitrary, his general characterizations for them invite the suspicion that, according to him, the lack of arbitrariness lies in the fact that the acceptance is mediated exclusively by other conventions and definitions. (b) Professor Kaufmann's views on the nature of truth can now be stated briefly, since the preceding discussion anticipates most of what he has to say. He holds that the meaning of "truth" is not logically inde- pendent of the rules in terms of which propositions become incorporated into bodies of knowledge. Accordingly, he rejects the correspondence theory of truth, at least in the form in which it is held by Russell, and finds the coherence view to be "basically sound." Needless to say, the coher- ence which he has in mind is not simply the formal consistency of one proposition with others; on the contrary, " 'coherence' must be defined in terms of the rules of scientific procedure" (p. 281). When "coherence" is so understood, the coherence of a proposition with those which serve as evi- dence for it, "is all that matters for its validity." His most explicit ac- count of what is to be understood by "truth" is contained in the following: We mean by a true proposition one that could be accepted if we had all possible knowledge which is relevant (in terms of the rules of procedure) for the decision whether it can be accepted, and that once accepted, could with- stand all possible controls (p. 279). I have only a few comments to make on Professor Kaufmann's account of truth. I am not sure whether the statement just quoted from him is intended to be an explicit definition of the term "true." But whether it is or not, it is clear that his aim is to analyze the notion of truth in terms of procedures involved in getting to know true propositions. His interest in the problem is therefore an epistemic one. There can be no serious quarrel with him on this score. But. one must bear in mind that not all who seek to</page><page sequence="18">TRUTH AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRLTTH 67 define "true" have the same general aim that he has. For example, given Professor Tarski's objective, his definition is not wrong or inadequate simply because it is stated without reference to any "criteria" of truth. Professor Kaufmann seems to suggest, nevertheless, that such alternative definitions (proposed for solving different problems) are quite wrong, for he commits himself to the view that the meaning of "truth" is not "logically independent of the meaning of verification." Moreover, when he rejects "the correspondence theory of truth," the grounds which he advances are, in my judgment, sufficient for rejecting the accounts given by some of those who take this theory to state how the "correspondence" is established; his grounds do not seem to be sufficient for rejecting every definition of "truth" in terms of "correspondence."3 Moreover, there are three difficulties I experience in connection with Professor Kaufmann's own account of the meaning of "truth." I am not clear how he can establish the necessary truth of the principle of excluded middle and other logical principles, if "true" is specified in terms of accepta- bility. This point has already been noted in the context of the discussion of Professor Ducasse's views, and need not be elaborated here any further. In the second place, the acceptability of a proposition for Professor Kauf- 3Since Professor Tarski's paper contains some comments on views I have expressed concerning semantics, I should like to state, if only with the greatest brevity, my opinions on the issue under controversy. I raised the question whether the semantic definition of truth is not simply a precise formulation of notions inherent in a special system of metaphysical assumptions. Professor Tarski's reply is that the only meta- physical assumptions which are found in semantics are those involved in the object- language to which the semantic notions refer. I take it, therefore, that his answer to my question is in the affirmative, since the ordinary object-language of common dis- course can be fairly said to assume such substantial entities as propositions (as dis- tinct from sentences), as well as a number of other types of entities such as forces and powers. The fact that the semantics of common discourse takes for granted such assumptions does not destroy the value of semantic investigations, and I did not even suggest that it does. I did suggest, and still believe, that the conclusions of semantic analyses are therefore not decisive with respect to a number of issues with which philosophers have been concerned. In particular, the fact that semantics defines propositions as the designata of sentences does not settle the questions whether propositions are the sort of things which platonizing philosophies of all ages have asserted them to be-any more than the fact that the word "force" occurs in physics settles the question whether an anthropomorphic conception of force is a war- ranted one. Professor Tarski believes that semantics has important applications not only in the methodology of the deductive sciences but also in the methodology of the empiri- cal sciences. Although "importance" is a relative and a highly subjective term, I will add for what it is worth that I have never doubted or questioned the first part of this claim, and that I am prepared to be convinced concerning the second part. I must also add, however, that the example Professor Tarski uses to support this second claim leaves me unimpressed.</page><page sequence="19">68 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH manim is always relative to a system of rules of procedure. It follows that whether a given proposition is true or not depends on what system of rules are "implicitly presupposed" in instituting controls for it. This is, to say the least, a paradoxical conception of truth. Is a proposition true relative to a Thomist set of controls, even if it is false relative to the controls of modern science? This would be Wissensoziologie run rampant! If this is indeed the outcome of Professor Kaufmann's views, I cannot persuade myself they are acceptable in terms of any consistent system of rules of procedure. Finally, on Professor Kaufmann's version, the truth of a proposition is specified in terms of the completion of a theoretically endless process. Accordingly, truth is simply an ideal of inquiry, and a synthetic proposition can never be established as true. Nevertheless, I see no way of contesting Professor G. E. Moore's point that "I know S" (where S is any proposi- tion) logically entails "S is true." In consequence, if Professor Kaufmann were right in his contention that a synthetic proposition can never be es- tablished as true, we would never know anything. This is certainly an awkward conclusion; and I do not think he can escape it by the simple device of proposing a different usage for the word "know." For the con- clusion and its skeptical overtones seem to me implicit in the Neo-Kantian position he adopts. In order to escape the conclusion and its consequences, he must modify his fundamental conception that a priori rules of procedure are definitory of "correctness," and he must identify cases of knowledge on the basis of the adequacy of proposed solutions to specific problems.* ERNEST NAGEL.
