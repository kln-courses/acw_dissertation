FAISON* T here is a common form of behavior which has important implications for consumer researchers that has received scant attention in the literature. This behavior has been dubbed by the author the "variety drive." The basic idea is that under certain conditions we all have a need for variety in our daily lives. While this simple notion is accepted at the popular level, it is inconsistent with many widely accepted theories of learning, motivation, and attitude change. Conventional descriptions of behavior in consumer behavior texts are based on the assumption that people have a series of needs which lead to drive states. These drive states, in turn, result in activities which eventually satisfy these needs. The activities which satisfy these needs become learned responses which are likely to be repeated as the needs recur. This is the basic position of behavioral learning theorists. Unfortunately, this thoretical model turns out to be too simplistic. There are many forms of everyday behavior which cannot be fitted into this model. Con- sider food preferences. Your favorite food may be steak but if it were served to you every night for a week, you would quickly tire of it and be screaming for change no matter how satisfying it was to your need state. Classical "instrumental" learning theory would lead to the view that since the steak was rewarding, the behavioral pattern leading to the eating of steak should be stamped in, somehow, so that the more times steak was consumed, the stronger the bond should have become causing behavior which would lead to steak for the next meal. This is what happens to rats in many of the "operant conditioning" experiments of B. F. Skinner. When a hungry rat is placed in a Skinner box, he soon learns to press the bar to produce the pellets which reduce its hunger. Each time the animal is rewarded the behavior pattern becomes more firmly fixed and more likely to occur. Within the past two decades, there have been a few isolated studies which have described behavior that does not fit into the classical mold. These studies have referred to such terms as "activity-seeking," curiosity drive (Fowler 1967), novelty-seeking (Finger and Mook 1971), sensation-seeking (Zuckerman, Kolin, Price, and Zoub (1964), exploratory drive (Nissen 1951), spontaneous alternation (Hosada 1964), optimal stimu- lation level (Hebb and Thompson 1954), incongruity seeking (Hunt 1963), innovative proneness (Rogers 1957), exploration erg (Cattell 1957), venturesomeness (Robertson 1970), variety position (Maddi 1968), op- timistic behavior, and collative stimulus properties (Berlyne 1968). Let's review some of the experiments that relate to this behavior in order to better understand its dimen- sions. First, consider the basic learning studies on laboratory animals. In 1967, Fowler described a series of experiments involving what he called the satiation or curiosity drive. Fowler showed that if the classical instrumental * Edmund W. J.

They would wander around rather than run directly to the food even under high-drive conditions of hunger. In anthropomorphic terms, the animals behaved as if they might be saying to themselves, "I know the food is down there and I know where it is. I think I might look around for a while and when I'm ready, I'll go get the food in my own good time." Another phenomenon which has been observed by animal researchers is the phenomenon of "'spontaneous alternation. " If hungry rats, possums, hamsters, or fer- rets are individually placed in a T-maze which has the same amount of food placed at the end points of both arms of the maze so that each rat must turn right to get one dish of food or left to get the other, a curious pattern may be evidenced by as many as fifty percent of the rats. This is the pattern of "spontaneous alterna- tion." In classical behavior theory, if a rat turns right at a choice point and is successfully rewarded with food, the next time the rat comes to the same choice point, there will be a stronger attraction to turn to the right again rather than turn to the previously unrewarded left. With this theory the rat is supposed to gradually develop a "right" behavior and "left" responses will be dropped out. Curiously, all rats do not conform to this theory (Denber and Fowler 1958). Many of them, after being rewarded for turning right will turn left the next time. These rats will develop a pattern of alterna- tion in which they will go first right and then left. Each time this alternation occurs, they are going toward the goal with less attraction in terms of recency of reward. This phenomenon has also been observed in humans (Schultz 1964). In 1971, Finger and Mook reported a series of ex- periments with several different species regarding the concept of novelty or variety and its effects on sexual behavior. Again, in classical behavior terms if an animal is sexually satisfied by a mate, the tendency to seek satisfaction again from the same mate would be increased. This does not seem to be the case. Finger and Mook report several experiments which demon- strate that the satiated male will resume mating if presented with a new partner. This novelty effect also seems to apply to a change in physical setting. A re- lated study by Beach and Ransom (1967) indicated that the probability of ejaculation for dairy bulls and water buffalo increased when they were moved to other areas after satiation had occurred in the standard arena. These studies give scientific respectability to many facets of human behavior which have been observed for some time. Laymen have observed for years that boredom can occur no matter how rewarding a previ- ous stimulus has been. This boredom appears to have motivating or drive state properties. Thus, it seems appropriate to label this type of motivation, "variety drive." It is more than curiosity or novelty. In many cases, what is desired is not a new or unfamiliar experience but simply a change of pace. This desire for a change of pace appears to represent a fundamental behavioral principle. Let's turn now to the realm of attitudes. Here, the phenomenon has been discussed under the rubric of "cognitive consistency theories." Such theories as cognitive dissonance (Festinger 1957), balance (Heider 1958), and incongruity (Osgood and Tannenbaum 1955), all postulate some sort of consistency drive which leads to cognitive behavior or attitude change which will reduce internal tension to some balance point. All of these theories are inconsistent with the implication that there is a drive for variety which, in effect, leads to an increase rather than a reduction of tension. A good summary of this phenomenon in rela- tion to consistency-seeking theories has been made by Venkatesen (1973) and McGuire (1966). None of these theories can handle observed variety- seeking behavior without modification. The key modification appears to be the balance point. These theories imply the optimal is a "zero" point where all cognitive tensions are in balance. This may be the wrong point. In 1954, Hebb and Thompson proposed that in man's "neural net" some sort of optimum level of stimulation, excitation, or activation was needed. Zero tension implies boredom, stagnation, and even death. Berlyne (1963) and Fiske and Maddi (1961) have at- tempted theoretical explanations of boredom involving the concept of arousal potential. The two theories are not in agreement and the concepts are too complex to explain in limited space, but the gist of these theories is that boredom occurs when the degree of arousal reaches the arousal potential so that tension is reduced to zero. This concept has received little attention in consumer behavior literature but a few specialists who have called attention to related aspects include Howard and Sheth (1969), Markin (1974), and Kerby (1975). Howard and Sheth, following the lead of Berlyne, suggested an " M" shaped curve relating tension (arousal) to stimulus ambiguity. Thus, very simple or very complex stimuli create tension, but the tension caused by simple stimuli leads to aversion. Markin, following the per- cepts of cognitive theory, indicates that the usual goal of consumer behavior is tension management rather than total tension reduction, and consumer tastes, at- titudes, values, and perceptions do change, generating a need for variety. Kerby hypothesizes that liking for a relevant object (or concept) will tend to increase as familiarity increases up to the point of boredom where it will tend to decrease. While this concept has been neglected by consumer behavior theorists, it is clear that it relates to many commonly observable behavior patterns.</page><page sequence="3">174 THE JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH Consider the popular situation of an individual striv- ing all his life to achieve the things he wants. Once they are achieved he settles back to enjoy them only to discover that the satisfaction is no longer there. The thrill was in the chase. This phenomenon has many implications of particular importance to consumer re- searchers. In addition the variety drive represents a bridge between the behaviorists and the humanists in regard to human behavior and the consideration of whether man is the pawn or the master of his fate. With this variety drive, it becomes unlikely that any manufacturer can exert a Svengali effect upon pur- chasers. Even though a consumer is completely satisfied with the brands he is buying, he occasionally buys another brand just for the "hell of it." This represents a promising advertising strategy for new products. Rather than trying to switch dissatisfied customers to your brand, simply encourage them to try the new product as a change of pace. This would have a much broader appeal where present brands are well entrenched. This variety drive may account for many facets of consumer behavior which have lacked adequate ex- planation. It is known, for example, that television viewers prefer to watch football games that are "live" rather than delayed. Superficially, this preference is hard to explain. The football players perform just as well under one condition as the other and all of the visual and auditory stimuli are the same. The difference, however, lies in the excitement of the unpredictability of the outcome of the live game. Viewers watching the action as it occurs have no idea who will win. A variety of outcomes is possible. Once the outcome is known, the game becomes a rerun with nothing new possible and thus becomes dull. Another facet of the variety drive may relate to interest in advertising messages. Repeated exposure to the same commercial or advertisement leads to bore- dom and inattention so that there is an interaction of factors occurring. Repetition leads to an increase in awareness but a decrease in interest as shown in the following paradigm: J o Many Repetition of Message The trick is to repeat the message with sufficient frequency so that the message gets across without boring the audience to the point of inattention. One common solution is to have several sales messages in a campaign that are rotated. Each message contains the same points but is presented in a different manner. The variety drive may also help account for the superiority of humorous or offbeat commercials for attracting attention or sustaining interest. There is no end to the number of situations where consumers desire variety. Recognition of this need for change is useful for the new product developers, advertisers, and others in the marketing chain. At the same time, there are many other situations where consumers seem to desire consistency more than novelty. A number of experi- ments are underway at the University of Hawaii to define the dimensions of variety and the situations where it appears most relevant. In summary, experimental evidence seems to indi- cate the inadequacy of classical behavior theory to account for certain unpredictable aspects of behavior. Behavioral patterns appear to lose their strength after continued repetition even though constantly rewarded. This is true for animals of many species. This has led to the positing of a "variety drive" which suggests the presence of an adaptation or boredom factor which oc- curs with continued reinforcement by the same stimu- lus and the need for a change of pace. In terms of attitudes, consistency theories appear to be inadequate. It is suggested that a zero point of tension balance appears to be inappropriate. Rather some optimal amount of cognitive tension is more likely to be desirable. Furthermore, this variety drive has many implica- tions for consumer researchers, such as willingness to try new products even though established products pro- vide adequate customer satisfaction.
