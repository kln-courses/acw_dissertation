<plain_text><page sequence="1">RICARDO NEMIROVSKY and TRACY NOBLE ON MATHEMATICAL VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE ABSTRACT. This paper is a case study of how a high school student, whom we call Karen, used a computer-based tool, the Contour Analyzer, to create graphs of height vs. distance and slope vs. distance for a flat board that she positioned with different slants and orientations. With the Contour Analyzer one can generate, on a computer screen, graphs representing functions of height and slope vs. distance corresponding to a line traced along the surface of a real object. Karen was interviewed for three one-hour sessions in an individual teaching experiment. In this paper, our focus is on how Karen came to recognize by visual inspection the mathematical behavior of the slope vs. distance function corresponding to contours traced on a flat board. Karen strove to organize her visual experience by distinguishing which aspects of the board are to be noticed and which ones are to be ignored, as well as by determining the point of view that one should adopt in order to 'see' the variation of slope along an object. We have found it inspiring to use Winnicott's (1971) ideas about transitional objects to examine the role of the graphing instrument for Karen. This theoretical background helped us to articulate a perspective on mathematical visualization that goes beyond the dualism between internal and external representations frequently assumed in the literature, and focuses on the lived-in space that Karen experienced which encompassed at once physical attributes of the tool and human possibilities of action. 1. INTRODUCTION 1. 1. Visualization Visualization has been an area of interest for a number of researchers concerned with mathematics education, particularly with the advent of computer technology that allows the possibility of a wide range of visual displays. Many researchers emphasize the importance of visualization and visual reasoning for learning mathematics (Greer, 1994; Horgan, 1993; Barwise and Etchemendy, 1991; Dorfler, 1991; Dreyfus, 1991; Zimmer- man and Cunningham, 1991; Bishop, 1989; Presmeg, 1989; Rival, 1987; Davis and Anderson, 1979). In their arguments for visualization, some authors refer to the work of present-day and historical mathematicians who have made use of visual forms of representation (Horgan, 1993; Dreyfus, 1991; Rival, 1987; Davis and Anderson, 1979). Others suggest that visual thinking can be an alternative and powerful resource for students doing mathematics (Barwise and Etchemendy, 1991; Dorfler, 1991; Goldenberg, Educational Studies in Mathematics 33: 99-131, 1997. ? 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in The Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">100 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE 1991; and Tall, 1991), a resource that can open the way to different ways of thinking about mathematics than the linguistic and logico-propositional thinking of traditional proofs and the symbol manipulation of traditional algebra. Several authors have also explored specific examples of visualization and visual reasoning in problem-solving contexts. Many of them have attempted to classify learners' solution strategies as visual or non-visual (Zazkis, Dubinsky and Dautermann, 1996; Galindo, 1995; Schofield and Kirby, 1994; Shama and Dreyfus, 1991). Some of these authors have allowed for 'mixed' strategies, involving visual strategies and others, such as algebraic strategies, in the same problem-solving task (Galindo, 1995; Shama and Dreyfus, 1991). Zazkis, Dubinsky, and Dautermann (1996) describe a model for moving back and forth between visual and analytic strategies which they propose may sometimes be more effective than the use of either visual or analytic strategies in isolation. Presmeg (1986, 1989, 1992) has gone a step further into the analysis of students' visual strategies to develop a list of kinds of visual imagery used by students: 'Concrete, pictorial imagery', 'Pattern imagery', 'Mem- ory images of formulae', 'Kinesthetic imagery', and 'Dynamic imagery'. She has also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using visual imagery. Some research has been done on the ways that software environ- ments can help to mitigate some of the disadvantages of visual imagery, particularly over-reliance on a single diagram (Yerushalmy and Chazan, 1990). Presmeg develops the idea of pattern imagery further in her 1992 paper, in which she defines pattern imagery as, 'the type of imagery in which concrete details are disregarded and pure relationships are depicted in a visual-spatial scheme' (p. 602). In addition to the software environment mentioned above, a number of other authors have described software environments intended to contribute to students' abilities to visualize in mathematics (Borba, 1993; Barwise and Etchemendy, 1991; Battista, Clements, and Wheatley, 1991; Gold- enberg, 1991; Hershkowitz, Friedlander, and Dreyfus, 1991; Tall, 1991). Some of the researchers working with software environments have also done detailed analyses of students' work on problems requiring visualiza- tion (Moschkovich, 1996; Monk and Nemirovsky, 1994; Borba, 1993; Her- shkowitz, Friedlander, and Dreyfus, 1991; Yerushalmy and Chazan, 1990), without the intention of classifying students or their strategies. These stud- ies have helped to describe the features of software environments that are helpful to students in the process of visual thinking; and, along with oth- er studies not involving software (Yackel and Wheatley, 1990), they all</page><page sequence="3">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 101 used case studies to describe further the nature of visualization and visual thinking. Within this large body of work on visualization and visual thinking, one finds a wide range of definitions of these terms, which seem particu- larly slippery to define (Bishop, 1989). Many authors work with flexible or implicit definitions, but one thing they agree upon is their focus on the per- ception and manipulation of visual images, as opposed to auditory, tactile, taste, or smell information. When researchers attempt to pin down what learners' processes of visualization are, a common difficulty arises from the need to describe whether the visual image is 'in the students' mind' or 'outside' the student, on piece of paper or a computer screen. Presmeg (1986), for instance, seems to locate visual imagery in the mind: 'A visual image is a mental scheme depicting visual or spatial information,' and she explains that this mental scheme can exist with or without the presence of the 'perceptual object' being visualized. On the other hand, a number of authors seem to locate a substantial part of the work of visualization in written work or work done with computer-generated images. Bishop (1989) quotes from the work of Moses (1977), whose 'degree of visuality' score was based on 'the number of visual solution processes (e. g. pic- tures, graphs, lists, tables) present in the written solutions,' (Bishop, 1989, p. 10). Zimmerman and Cunningham (1991) seem to waver on the issue of where the visual image is, at one point defining visualization as "the process of producing or using geometrical or graphical representations of mathematical concepts, principles, or problems, whether hand drawn or computer-generated' (p. 1), and at another point saying that visualization involves 'forming images (mentally, or with paper and pencil, or with the aid of technology),' (p. 3). Some authors have attempted to describe the process whereby the connection is made between 'external' images and information 'in the mind'. Schnotz, Zink, and Pfeiffer (1995) describe visualization as 'a process of structure-mapping of a visuo-spatial config- uration onto a mental model,' (p. 1) in an information-processing type of description of the process. Zazkis, Dubinsky, and Dautermann (1996) take on this issue of whether visualization occurs purely 'in the mind' of the visualizer or must involve drawings, objects, or computer-generated images when they offer a more precise definition that takes into account the range of possible processes: Visualization is an act in which an individual establishes a strong connection between an internal construct and something to which access is gained through the senses. Such a connection can be made in either of two directions. An act of visualization may consist of any mental construction of objects or processes that an individual associates with objects or events perceived by her or him as external. Alternatively, an act of visualization may consist of the construction, on some external medium such as paper, chalkboard, or computer</page><page sequence="4">102 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE screen, of objects or events which the individual identifies with object(s) or process(es) in her or his mind (1996, p. 441). This definition, in addition to being more precise than many we have seen in the literature, does not restrict visualization to either the learner's 'mind,' or 'some external medium,' but defines visualization as the means for traveling between these two. Zazkis, Dubinsky, and Dautermann are consistent with the literature on visualization in that they also make a distinction between what is external (on paper or a computer screen) and what is internal (in the mind). However, they allow that it is the individual who perceives these objects as internal or external, avoiding making the claim that they as researchers can define what is internal or external. 1.2. Internal vs External We propose that the difficulty in defining visualization which arises from the issue of whether visual representations are internal or external is due to the taken for granted dichotomy between internal ('in the mind') and external (on paper, on a computer screen, etc.). Some things may be per- ceived as internal or external to an individual, as Zazkis, Dubinsky, and Dautermann explicitly state in their definition, but we challenge the notion that any given picture, object, representation, etc. actually resides inside or outside of a person's mind. We believe the construct of inside versus outside the mind is limited because it disallows the possibility of being neither inside or outside, or both inside and outside at the same time. Cobb, Yackel, and Wood (1992) take on the issue of the 'dualism cre- ated between mathematics in students' heads and mathematics in their environment' present in what they call 'the representational view of mind,' (p. 2) which they find to be prevalent in mathematics education today. In the representational view of mind, the 'overall goal of instruction is to help students construct mental representations that correctly or accurately mirror mathematical relationships located outside the mind in instructional representations,' (p. 4). Thus, according to Cobb, Yackel, and Wood, this view comes into direct conflict with constructivist views of learning, in which 'learning is described as a process in which students actively con- struct mathematical knowledge as they strive to make sense of their own worlds' (p. 6). As a resolution to this conflict, the authors suggest: 'As an alternative that unites mathematics and the knower, we have suggest- ed that it is useful for educational purposes to characterize mathematics as both an individual and a collective human activity,' in which 'what is traditionally called the content could be seen to emerge in the course of the teacher's and students' interactions as the teacher guided both the individual student's constructive activities and the evolution of the class-</page><page sequence="5">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 103 room community's taken-as-shared meanings and practices' (pp. 26-27). This strategy 'unites mathematics and the knower' by avoiding the temp- tation to project expert meanings into instructional materials, and instead recognizing that the mathematical meanings lie in 'the ways that students interpreted and acted with pedagogical symbol systems as they negotiated mathematical meanings with others in the classroom' (p. 26). This view of mathematical meaning obviates the need to describe what is inside or outside of a student's mind, because the mathematics of the classroom exists in neither place, but instead in the collective activity of the students and teacher. Cobb, Yackel, and Wood have articulated a perspective on instructional materials that recognizes that the tools and materials students use in the classroom acquire meaning only through the activity of students with these tools. This is consistent with arguments made by Teasley and Roschelle (1993) and Meira (in press) against the notion of the transparency of either software or physical devices and their embodiment of physical or mathematical principles that will become apparent to students working with them. Meira (in press) suggests that physical devices be thought of instead as 'conversation pieces', and Teasley and Roschelle (1993) describe external displays as 'tools for negotiating meaning,' rather than tools for conveying meaning. We view the tools that students worked with in our study in a similar way. We prefer to think of them as 'conversation pieces,' rather than devices for helping students to internalize a particular visual representation. Given that the meaning a student will construct when using a particular graph, for example, cannot be predicted, we feel the case study serves an important role in helping us to probe in detail into the individual and idiosyncratic meanings students may construct for themselves from a graph. The argument that Cobb, Yackel, and Wood make to avoid the contra- dictions of a representational view of mind is well-suited to understanding the collective mathematical activities of groups of students in the class- room. However, this collective activity must, of necessity, involve 'the constructive activities of individuals,' (p. 28) but what is the nature of this individual constructive activity? What is the psychological perspective that can help us to understand an individual's activity without falling back on the idea of the dichotomy between what is inside and what is outside stu- dents' minds? That perspective is what we will try to articulate in this paper.</page><page sequence="6">104 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE 2. THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE If play is neither inside nor outside, where is it? Winnicott, 1971, p.96 In our culture the distinction between inner and outer seems so obvious and natural that rarely we stop to think on all that goes into the making of such a split of human experience. As a consequence, we even lack a rich language to answer Winnicott's question about where play is located. To reflect on the 'where' of play, or more generally, on what Winnicott has entitled 'the place where we live,' we use the term 'lived-in space.' Elsewhere we have described an example of a common experience that may help us to characterize lived-in spaces: From time to time it happens to many of us that changes are made in a very familiar place; for instance, removing a prominent table from a room that we frequently use in our house. Then, when we enter the room we immediately notice that it is not the same room we are accustomed to. Sometimes one does not easily recognize what has specifically been changed; but even if one identifies the missing table, the room as a whole looks different, possibly bigger and emptier. Other pieces of furniture present a new appearance, as if they changed their size, location, or appeal. The room may also seem more or less inviting as we perceive a demand to modify the ways of using and being in the room. As time goes by, as we start to live in this altered room, the sense of the customary begins to develop. The room becomes just what it is, not bigger or smaller, emptier or fuller, but a 'normal' one. This gradual transformation of the room becoming ordinary is not a change in the metric properties of the physical configuration of the room, but in our experience of the room, in how we walk in it, in what activities we develop there, and in our daily re-encounter with what used to be and has remained in the room. (Nemirovsky, Tierney, and Wright, 1995, p. 63). A friend of ours, whom we will call Elena, was a few months ago looking for a larger house to move into with her family. Talking about this ongoing pursuit, Elena said that before coming to her current house she and her family had lived for a number of years in a very small apartment, and that when they moved they felt that their new house was huge, to the point that for a while they tended to use only part of the house. 'And now,' Elena said, 'the house feels too small.' Paraphrasing Winnicott we can ask: 'Where did Elena live?' A deceptively simple answer would be 'at 56 Main St.' But even if we spend a long time at 56 Main St., no description of the dwelling will be enough to grasp the transformation of the house from being huge to being small. The need may arise to complement the description of the house with Elena's 'mental representations' of the house. Mental representations are generally viewed as either formal structures or sets of 'principles' that govern the person's thinking. However, we believe that no description</page><page sequence="7">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 105 of Elena's assumed mental representations will be enough to grasp the transformation of the house from being huge to being small. The move toward mental representations is not a neutral choice, because it leaves out what is most essential: Elena's actual and idiosyncratic life experience. In order to grapple with the question 'Where did Elena live?' we have to immerse ourselves in the history of her life, whom she lived with, what kind activities she and her family developed at home, the sociocultural atmosphere of her time and place, the growth of her daughter, and so forth. At the same time, it is by reflecting on our own life experience and how it relates to Elena's that we can meaningfully grasp the transformation of her house that was huge and became small. Elena lived in a place that cannot be encapsulated by an architectural plan or a mental structure. It could be argued that mental representations are more than formal structures or sets of principles, that they encompass the aggregate memory of all the relevant life experiences that play a role in Elena's changing perception of her house. However this point of view weakens the notion of mental representation by making it indistinguishable from the idea of lived experience. This proposed broader conception of mental representations, by preserving the notion that the mental representation is 'carried' by the individual, still does not solve the difficulties in accounting for the marked experiential differences between Elena-in-the-house and Elena- somewhere-else-remembering-the-house. Being in the actual house is not the same as remembering it; being in the actual house involves ways of acting, communicating, and perceiving that are not necessarily part of recalling what it is like to be there. A lived-in space is not 'carried' by the individual, but created in an ongoing process that involves memories, intentions, and the situation at hand. Many philosophers have attempted to characterize the human experi- ence without falling into empiricism or mentalism. Outstanding among them are Heidegger (1927/1962) and Merleau Ponty (1946/1989), who strove to understand the human experience as a whole, without forcing it to split into fundamental dichotomies, such as subjective/objective or body/mind. Following Husserl's call: 'To the things themselves!' an impor- tant trend in this philosophy is to explore the significance of our everyday activities, of our ongoing use of language, and of our engagement in social practices. Truth, objectivity, matter, and all the traditional terms of philos- ophy are 'bracketed,' that is, the issue is not to define them, but to describe how we use them and how they relate to our life experience. Furthermore, instead of positing causal explanations for human activities, such as a men- tal model does, the intent of these philosophers is to produce fresh ways of seeing the nature of human existence, or, in our case, the nature of learning</page><page sequence="8">106 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE and understanding. Researchers, such as Marton and Saljo (1984) have developed work within the field of educational research that strives to be consistent with the views of some of these philosophers. To focus on the issues surrounding the use of tools in learning mathemat- ics, we will turn our attention here to Winnicott's conception of 'transitional phenomena' (1971). The next section briefly describes some of Winnicott's ideas that are potentially relevant to our analysis. Because Winnicott devel- oped his views based on his work as psychiatrist, we should not expect a strict correspondence between his conjectures and our observations with students. Rather, we invoke Winnicott's perspectives as an inspirational background from an exceptional observer of human transactions and moti- vations. 2.1. Winnicott on the Nature of Playing and Symbolizing As a child psychoanalyst, Winnicott was captivated by the richness and creativity of children's play. He criticized the psychoanalytic approaches of his time for focusing on the 'use' of play for therapeutic and interpretive purposes, and not on the role of playing in human life. Winnicott saw in children's play something essential about human nature: The place where cultural experience is located is in the potential space' between the individual and the environment. The same can be said of playing. Cultural experience begins with creative living first manifested in play. For every individual the use of this space is determined by life experiences that take place at the early stages of the individual's existence. (Winnicott, 1971, p.100, italics in the original). One of Winnicott's primary goals was to find a developmental thread in the constitution of the potential space. To this end, he paid careful attention to children's almost universal use of objects toward which they feel strong emotional attachment (stuffed animals, blankets, strings, etc.); he called them 'transitional objects'. Winnicott claimed that experiences with tran- sitional objects are crucial in children's becoming individual beings. An assumption common to psychologists of many orientations is that the new- born baby does not perceive the mother (or whoever is caring for the baby) as a being independent of the baby himself. Maintaining this 'illusion' (from our adult point of view) is actively pursued by the caring mother, who satisfies the baby's needs with minimal delay. As the baby grows, the mother is less available and at this stage transitional objects come into play. The baby creates transitional objects to make the mother available in a symbolic sense and to cope with the gradual loss of the sense of control that was ingrained in the experienced 'illusion.' Winnicott argued that crucial aspects of the experience of transitional objects are trust and care; playing can arise only if the child feels that</page><page sequence="9">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 107 the use of transitional objects does not make the mother impassive or unresponsive. The separation between the child and mother that transitional phenomena help to accomplish is a creative form of union. Caring adults seem to intuitively understand that it is important to participate in the use of transitional objects by respecting, going along with, and contributing to the imaginary actions, words, and attitudes that the child makes these objects enact. The child's experience with transitional objects is from the very beginning inherently interpersonal or social. Winnicott believed that the most central characteristic of this interpersonal involvement is the unquestioned acceptance of the fundamental ambiguity about whether the transitional object is external or internal, about whether it exists in the imagination of the child or in the 'not-me' world of independent objects: Of the transitional object it can be said that it is a matter of agreement between us and the baby that we will never ask the question: 'Did you conceive of this or was it presented to you from without?' The important point is that no decision on this point is expected. The question is not to be formulated. (1971, p. 12). Winnicott stressed that a transitional object ceases to be used not because it is 'internalized' but because its meaning gets 'dissolved', that is, the issue that the child was attempting to cope with and make sense of with the transitional object is not an issue anymore. While Winnicott highlighted the foundational role of the early uses of transitional objects, he also stressed that they are part of the meaningful use by children, ado- lescents, and adults, of symbols 'that stand at one and the same time for external world phenomena and for phenomena of the individual person who is being looked at,' (p. 109). What grows from these activities is the ongoing creation, spanning all stages of life, of an intermediate area of experience that constitutes the 'place where we live:' . . . it can be said that separation is avoided by the filling in of the potential space with creative playing, with the use of symbols, and with all that eventually adds up to a cultural life. ( p. 109) 3. THE CASE STUDY This paper is a case study of how a high school student, whom we call Karen, used a computer-based tool to create graphs of height vs. distance and slope vs. distance for a flat board that she positioned with different slants and orientations. We examine the conversation between Karen and Ricardo as a gradual development of a lived-in space within which the graphing instrument came to be experienced as a transitional object. The idea of analyzing a learning tool as a transitional object has been explored</page><page sequence="10">108 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE by Papert (1980). Papert described the turtle in computer Logo environ- ments as a transitional object: a 'me' and 'not-me' entity that can stand at one and the same time for trajectories on a plane and for one's walking a surface. Papert called 'syntonic' the use of tools merging one's own bod- ily understanding with mathematical ideas; he advocated the richness of syntonic learning, suggesting that in such a context mathematics could be learned similarly to how we learn a new language when we live in a land where the language is spoken. 3.1. The Contour Analyzer The Contour Analyzer was designed to study contours of objects, or paths, each in a given plane, along a three-dimensional object. The device can be used to trace contours of an object by sliding a tracer along the surface of the object. The fixed frame of the Contour Analyzer keeps each contour in one plane, but the object being measured can be rotated on a turn-able table, so that many different planes can be used to take different contours of .an object. The device was intended to be used to work with two different spatial functions related through differentiation and integration: height vs. distance and slope vs. distance. Arthur Ganson constructed the device and Walter Lenk programmed the software environment. The design of this device was also inspired by Judah Schwartz's ideas about spatial functions. Figure 1 depicts the front and right views of the device. --Tracer Distance Front view Right side view Figure 1. The tracer can be moved by hand along the surface of an object, such as the flat board shown above. The tracer can be moved in a plane framed by the top bar and two side bars of the Contour Analyzer. As the tracer</page><page sequence="11">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 109 moves, a mechanism turns two potentiometers, which the computer uses to determine the vertical and horizontal coordinates of the tracer at any time. Thus, as one slides the tracer along an object, a graph of height vs. distance appears on the screen in real time. After the measurements have been taken it is possible to display a graph of slope vs. distance. 4. ANNOTATED TRANSCRIPT 4. 1. Karen Karen was in the 11th grade in high school at the time of the interview. She had taken algebra I, geometry, biology, chemistry, and, at the time of the teaching experiment, was taking algebra II and physics. Karen planned to pursue a career in science, possibly in biology, and commented that she did better in science than in math. She wanted to be useful for the research project and her engagement in the interview sessions never seemed to decline. X J;141 A~~~~~~~~Tracer Ditac Front viexvw Figure 2. 4.2. Episode 1: 'If you think about it, we could be reading it from the wrong side' For the first 20 minutes of Karen's first interview, she worked with Ricardo on the problem of imagining and creating the cross sections of a paper cup cut by various cutting planes. About 20 minutes into Karen's first inter- view, Ricardo introduced the Contour Analyzer (see Figure 1) to Karen. He showed Karen how the whole assembly of the tilted board standing on the turn-able table could be rotated or translated to put the board in</page><page sequence="12">110 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE different positions. Ricardo called the plane in which the tracer moves the cutting plane, alluding to the problem of the cross sections of a paper cup. Ricardo demonstrated how the tracer moves along vertical and horizon- tal directions, so that the device measures the height and the horizontal position independently. Karen commented: 'Oh, so you're kind of getting coordinates.' Karen easily predicted that the height vs. distance graph produced by moving the tracer across the board would be a straight line showing the tilt of the board (see Figure 2). Her drawing is shown in Figure 3. Then Karen traced along the board with the tracer (See Figure 4). The graph that appeared on the computer screen, reproduced in Figure 4, looked very much like the graph she had drawn. Karen commented on the graph: Figure 3.

Karen made sense of the computer Figure 4 as a literal transposition of the tracer plane, or plane that the tracer moved in at any given time. She</page><page sequence="13">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 11l thought of the tracer plane as a paper sheet recording the cross section of the board passing through it, which gets transposed onto the computer screen. In this fashion, the plane that the tracer moved in correspond- edfor her to the Cartesian axes displayed on the screen. Note how Karen described the production of Figure 4 in terms of her own imaginary actions: 'pulling off,' 'putting it up,' and so forth. Next Ricardo asked Karen how she would indicate the steepness of the line she had drawn, in Figure 3. &lt;2&gt; Karen: Steep? You mean as in slope? &lt;3&gt; Ricardo: How steep. Or the slope, yes. &lt;4&gt; Karen: The only steepness I know about is slope from math class. Well, I'd probably set it up on a graph like, that [pointing to Figure 3] I can see. And either count it out or I could use - ah, if I could remember the formula - I believe it's rise over run, to figure out slope for a line on a graph. And in that way I guess you could figure out its steepness. I don't know any other methods. Karen immediately associated the word slope with school math: '- ah, if I could remember the formula'. She even recalled the definition com- monly used by teachers ('rise over run') but she did not know how it could be used for the present case. This would happen a few times during the conversation; Karen would try to remember procedures that she had been taught in school to compute slope and then shift toward ideas that seemed more fruitful to her in dealing with the problem at hand. Ricardo drew axes for Karen's drawn graph (Figure 3), added a new set of perpendicular axes below them and asked: &lt;5&gt; Ricardo: Let's think of a graph of slope versus distance. What do you think the sha-? How would the graph look like? &lt;6&gt; Karen: OK, well, it's [Figure 3] a straight line so the slope isn't going to change. So if it's slope versus distance it again would be a straight line and it would probably be straight across [gesturing a horizontal line], like, it would be - what's the word I'm looking for? - slope 0, where it's straight horizontal? I believe that's right. While Karen added to the height vs. distance graph (see Figure 5) and drew the slope vs. distance graph, she said: &lt;7&gt; Karen: ... So it's straight it would be - depending on where you want it - I'm going to draw it right on the x axis, but I'll do it a little above so you can see it, but it should be a straight line [draws a line on the horizontal axis for the slope vs. distance graph, Figure 5] 'cause it</page><page sequence="14">112 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE doesn't - if you made a - took a reading here [draws the upper triangle on the height vs. distance graph, Figure 5] it would be the same thing as down here [draws the lower triangle].

Height new line distance Slope new line (drawn over old line) distance Figure 6.</page><page sequence="15">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 113 Ricardo changed the tilt of the board, and asked Karen about the cor- responding graphs. Karen drew a new line for the height graph and a horizontal line on the x axis for the slope graph (see Figure 6). Karen explained why the two slope graphs are the same as she drew the second slope graph: &lt;8&gt; Karen: Well, actually that [the slope for the new graph] would also be the same, 'cause it's a straight line [gestures a straight, slanted line in space] so slope wouldn't change again. So actually I could just re-draw the black line that was here [drawing the second slope line, right over the first one], 'cause they're both zero. If we had a bumpy piece of material then that would be different, so. In trying to recognize the graph of slope vs. distance, Karen focused on the straightness of Figure 3. By highlighting that the line is 'nice and straight', Karen implicitly contrasted it with a possible bumpy or curved contour She symbolized the straightness of Figure 3 with a constant zero slope. The little triangles that she drew on the height vs. distance graph of Figure 5, frequently used in schools to mark the slope of a line, were to indicate that the slope does not change along the line and therefore the slope graph should be a constant and equal to zero. In &lt;6&gt; and &lt;7&gt;, Karen envisioned a slope graph as indicating levels of straightness, so that being on zero meant perfect straightness and not being on zero showed 'bumpiness.' Note that she articulated her expectations for the computer slope graph on the basis of what she saw - degree of straightness - when looking at the board. Karen and Ricardo measured the board at its new slant with the Contour Analyzer, producing a new height vs. distance graph, displayed along with the previous graph (see Figure 7). They also had the software make slope vs. distance graphs for the first time, for the previous slant of the board and the current slant. The newest data are shown in the darker lines. In Figure 7, the computer displayed two horizontal lines for the slope, as Karen had predicted; but both were below the axis, which she had not predicted. Karen's reaction to the non-zero slope graphs is shown below: &lt;9&gt; Karen: Oh, I was right, it [the slope graph in Figure 7] was going to be straight, but it's a little lower than I thought. It's a little below the zero [axis]. But they're [the slope graphs are] reasonably straight. &lt;10&gt; Ricardo: Is there any reason why this [the slope graph in Figure 7] is below zero and not zero? Each one of these curves [the slope graph in Figure 7]? &lt;11&gt; Karen: Uum, I don't know. Maybe because of the readings I took. Because, as I said it wasn't comple- you know, wasn't perfect straight</page><page sequence="16">114 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE Height 45.0 33.8- 22.5- 11.3 0.0_ I I l 0.0 23.5 4.7 0 70.5 94.0 Horizontal Distance (cm) Slope 5.0 . 0.0 -5.0 l l l 0.0 23.5 47.0 70.5 94.0 Horizontal Distance (cm) Figure 7. line. You can see the little bumps here and there. That is possible. Um, I don't know of any laws that say you can't have something that slopes zero. Maybe it's just a theory they give you. Sometimes you never use, but I don't know of any like that, so. &lt;12&gt; Ricardo: Then there is something that doesn't make sense to you.</page><page sequence="17">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 115 &lt; 13&gt; Karen: Yes, because if it doesn't change, the slope would not change, so maybe, I just don't know. It's just a matter of having enough theory and math. &lt;14&gt; Ricardo: ... Perhaps you can think of why the second measurement looks like below the first one [on Slope Graph 2]. &lt;15&gt; Karen: Maybe I bumped the board too many times, but I don't think that's it. mmmm. I'm really not sure. &lt;16&gt; Ricardo: Then your intuition is that no matter how the plane is locat- ed.... &lt;17&gt; Karen: Tilted, it [the slope] should have been zero, because the board is not bending that much that I can see. Of course I don't have that, you know, cannot really see very, very finite [fine] details in the board, such as a computer might. The slope graph in Figure 7 shows lines that are somewhat jagged, but Karen deemed them 'reasonably straight', because she saw the wiggles as noise to be ignored. The slope graph met Karen's expectation that experimental measurements always departfrom ideal curves. If on the one hand she could dismiss the unevenness of the graph, on the other hand it's being 'a little below' the x-axis was problematic, and Karen tried to explain this in a number of ways. First she observed the board more closely and noticed that 'you can see the little bumps here and there'; ideal, perfect boards should produce slope graphs on zero, but this was a 'real' one. She added to this account a contrast between theory and practice: 'Maybe it's just a theory they give you.' They (teachers? mathematicians?), give theories to be used with idealized objects. In &lt;15&gt;, Karen wondered how she had moved the tracer with her own hand: 'Maybe I bumped the board too many times'. But all these sources of bumpiness remained unconvincing to her: the board was not remarkably rugged, and she did not remember having 'bumped' the board as she moved the tracer She concluded in &lt;17&gt; that the computer could "see" levels of bending that are not noticeable to her: the computer's sensitivity to irregularities in the straightness of the board might be above human capabilities. &lt;18&gt; Ricardo: ... Let's say that I tell you that, if there is something that has a slope of this type [drawing Figure 8], that is horizontal but not zero, can you imagine what it was, what that could be? Karen initially tried to use the rise over run formula she had learned in school: 'All I know is when something is a slope of 2, it's like 2 over 1.' She quickly gave up on this method, and then suddenly made a connection with work her class had done earlier with velocity, using motion detectors.</page><page sequence="18">116 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE slope distance Figure 8. &lt;19&gt; Karen: Well one - I just thought of something now - one of the reasons it might be below the zero is 'cause it's going down [gestures a line slanting downwardfrom left to right] and it might be a negative slope. Where if it was going from the bottom left to the upper right [gestures these locations in space], it might be above the zero. Because come to think of it now when we did our velocity graphs [in a physics class at school], which was very unusual for us because we never worked with velocity before, when you're going towards the [motion] sensor it was negative. But when you went away it was positive. Even if you were still increasing speed it [the velocity graph] would go the other way [down]. And it's like counting negatives, the numbers go up, and it gives you the illusion of it getting bigger really when it isn't... So that might be the only reason that it's below the zeros, because it's a negative slope. But I thought it would be zero because it's a straight line, the slope doesn't change. Ricardo 's question in &lt;18&gt; shifted the conversation from what Karen expected to see on the slope graph for the slanted board, to what kind of object might have a horizontal but non-zero slope graph. Karen reacted by putting aside the issue of the straightness of the board and focusing on a new visual attribute of the board: going down or up. Karen perceived that the duality of sign inherent in the non-zero slope graph (positive/negative) was consistent with the two possible orientations (up/down) of the board. Note how Karen's dimension of straightness could not accommodate a signed graphical space. Straightness has an absolute extreme (perfect straightness) and varying degrees of departure from that extreme (bumpi- ness). Bumpiness does not have 'another way' to increase, in order to get negative values on the graph. On the other hand, there is a duality in how one could go up or down on the board, which conforms to the structure of a signed graphical space. Karen's recognition that the sign of the slope graph showed the up/down slantiness of the board was grounded in her previous experience with</page><page sequence="19">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 117 velocity graphs and the motion detector in her physics class at school. With the motion detector displaying a graph of velocity vs. time of one's motion in front of it, the speed one goes causes the graph to displace more up or down depending on whether one is walking toward or away from the motion detector It had been initially counterintuitive to Karen that the velocity graph could go down even when she speeded up (if her velocity was negative): '... even if you were still increasing speed, it [the velocity graph] would go the other way [down].'3 This insight had had a longer historyfor Karen, a history of grappling with the 'illusion' ofperceiving the counting down of negative numbers as an increase: 'And it's like counting negatives, the numbers go up, and it gives you the illusion of it getting bigger really when it isn't.' As we will see in the ensuing conversation, the distinction between going up or down on the board entailedfor Karen an important ambiguity regarding the point of view of the tool. &lt;20&gt; Ricardo: How we can test that idea [that the sign of the slope depends on the slant of the board]? Perhaps you can... &lt;21&gt; Karen: Tilt the board the other way [slanting up to the right, see Figure 9] and try taking a reading and see what it says. [Ricardo: OK. Let's do that, yes.] ...

Because, if you think about it we could be reading it from the wrong side [see Figure 10]. So it depends on. As I said, this [points to the ContourAnalyzer] is all, probably all calibrated just to that [computer] screen [to showing the graph as seeing from her side]. So we have to have that in mind. &lt;23&gt; Ricardo: Right. If I understand what you said, in principle you could measure in such a way that the screen goes in a way and...</page><page sequence="20">118 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE The "other side" The Countour analyzer as of the table seen from the "other side." Tracing the board fromn this side's left to right is "going downward." Karen stood on this side of the table. Tracing the board fiom her left to her right is "going upward." Figure JO. &lt;24&gt; Karen: I'm just saying you could stand on the other side of the table and see the inverse [reversing her left and right hands] of the whole thing. When does one go up or down on the board? Note Karen's concern about how one has to be looking at the board to be consistent with the computer graph (otherwise we 'would mess up everything'). This is impor- tant to her because tracing the board from left to right could be seen as a movement up or down depending on which side of the table one is stand- ing on. We will remark in Episode 2 on how Karen's perception of going up or down as relative to the observer prompted her to wonder what the computer knows about the observer Karen measured the board tilted 'the other way' (See Figures 9 and 10) with the Contour Analyzer, keeping the last set of measurements, from the board with the old tilt (see Figure 4) in the background in order to compare. The resulting graphs are shown in Figure 11. &lt;25&gt; Karen: I had the right idea. One's a positive slope and the other's a negative slope. And they're both reasonably straight [gesturing a horizontal line] but they're not on zero, so, maybe one is a slope of point one, and the other is a slope of point negative one. I didn't realize that earlier. From &lt;9&gt; onward, the tool had become for Karen an instrument to explore ways of looking at the board in order to predict its slope. In &lt;25&gt;, Karen interpreted the slope graph in Figure 1] as if the Contour Analyzer had confirmed her new approach to seeing the slope of the board: departure</page><page sequence="21">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 119 Height 45.0 33.8- new 22.5- 11.3 0.0* 0.0 23.5 47.0 70.5 9 .0 Hoxizontal Distance (cm) Slope 5.0 - new 0.0 - 0.0 23.5 47.0 70.5 94.0 Horizontal Distane (cm) Figure 11. from zero showed how steeply one goes up or down. Note that throughout this Episode, the action of 'going' on the board was anchored in Karen's movement of the tracer on the board.</page><page sequence="22">120 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE 4.3. Episode 2: 'This is a smart computer.' This episode took place at the beginning of Karen's second interview. Karen and Ricardo were reviewing her ideas about the sign of the slope. Karen positioned the board sloping upwards to the right, in order to get a positive slope, and then measured the slope of the board with the Contour Analyzer by moving the tracer from right to left along the board, as shown below: Ttpper right /y Moio of trae sh... _/_,lwn.........,_ Lower left Figure 12. This measurement yielded a positive slope graph, and Ricardo asked Karen what would happen if the tracer were moved in the other direction (see Figure 13). She answered: &lt;26&gt; Karen: It would probably read it as a negative slope, as if it had been turned around the way you see it [Ricardo was standing on the other side of the board, see Figure 10], or I see it, standing here. Because you would be seeing the other way. It would be simply turned already 180 [degrees] for you. Karen tried measuring the board as shown in Figure 13. After compar- ing the two measurements on the computer screen, which yielded nearly identical results, Karen said: &lt;27&gt; Karen: Actually, it looks the same. This is a smart computer. Good trick.... The point is they're both positive. So that changes my idea now. The thing is, how does it [the computer] know that we just simply moved it [the tracer] the other way? It must have been something that we did.</page><page sequence="23">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 121 Upper right Motion of tracer shown Lower left Figure 13. For Karen, the motion of the tracer on the board was the only form of active communication she had with the computer: whatever slope sign was displayed on the computer screen had to be based on how the tracer moved. The same movement of the tracerfrom right to left would be seen as a movementfrom left to rightfrom the opposite side. This was consequential because standing on the opposite side of the table was equivalent to turning the board 180 degrees, and changing the sign of its slope. After observing that the Contour Analyzer had not portrayed the differ- ence in the tracer's motion as a change of slope sign, Karen wondered how the computer could know that the board had not been turned, even though the tracer went up in one case (when she traced the board from left to right), and down in the other case (when she traced the boardfrom right to left). Karen conjectured first that somehow she must have indicated to the computer that the board stayed on the same orientation ('Good trick', 'It must have been something that we did'), but the fact that the only channel of communication seemed to be the motion of the tracer left this issue open. &lt;28&gt; Ricardo: Can you say more about that? &lt;29&gt; Karen: ... I don't believe it [the computer] has any way of knowing that we haven't tumed the board. Unless this [the computer] somehow knows it always has to move in a certain direction [gestures right to left] to get a negative slope when moving upward. So it may have to do with how it [the apparatus] was set up and what that [the computer] was programmed to react to. Because if we tum this [the board] around and take the reading upward again, it would know it's going in the... Say you have an x-y axis, negative direction [right to left], upward and that would be a negative slope.</page><page sequence="24">122 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE Karen realized that the computer could distinguish whether the tracer changed the direction of its vertical motion because: (1) one traced the board in the opposite direction or, (2) one had turned the board 180 degrees and traced the board in the same direction. Karen began to envision an approach to determine the slope sign that would take into account both dimensions simultaneously: 'Unless this [the computer] somehow knows it always has to move in a certain direction [gestures right to left] to get a negative slope when moving upward.' Later on in this interview, Karen assigned signs to four possible direc- tions of tracer motion (positive for upward and rightward, negative for downward and leftward), so that the sign of the slope was given by the product of the signs of the two dimensions, e. g. upward*leftward = + * - = -. With this approach, changing the tracer's direction of motion from left-to-right to right-to-left does not change the sign of the product (e.g.: upward*rightward becomes downward*leftward, both products with the same positive sign) (see Figure 14). tracing the board tracing the board right to left left to right becomes....

This is how Karen solved the problem of how the computer could have possibly known "that we just simply moved it [the tracer] the other way, " instead of turning the board 180 degrees. 5. DISCUSSION We have found it inspiring to use Winnicott's ideas about transitional objects to examine the role of the Contour Analyzer for Karen as a tran- sitional object that both separates her from the tilted board, and brings her closer to it in a new manner of symbol-use. In this discussion we will highlight three different moments in the conversation between Karen and Ricardo and elaborate on their significance as we see it. 5. 1. Moment 1: What the Contour Analyzer Does &lt;1&gt; Karen: So it's [the computer graph] measuring exactly where it [point- ing to the tracer] is as if that [pointing to the graph on the computer screen] was like a sheet of paper touching it [the board] right there [at the line the tracer has moved along], and we just pulled it [the sheet of paper] off and put it up here [on the computer screen]. Karen interpreted the graph of height vs. distance in terms of imagi- nary actions that she could enact to create it. Karen knew that this was a metaphoric account (there was no paper sheet that anyone had pulled, etc.), which is why she started by saying 'as if ...' She felt she had understood the instrument and its graphical production by creating a scenario that combined elements of the tool (e.g. 'touching it right there') and ways in which someone could draw a cross section by hand. Karen dealt with the meaning of the computer graph by bringing into play human possibilities of action (e.g. pulling, touching, moving objects, etc.), trying to envision an experience that could emulate the tool's doings. We see in this moment the creation by Karen of a place that is neither outside or inside her. The graph of height vs. distance and the instrument that generated it are for Karen neither a detached mechanism outside of her, with a purely electronic and physical existence, nor a delusion dwelling in her imagination in which paper sheets are pulled from one place and pasted somewhere else. The indeterminate internal/external nature of her experience with the graphing tool marked the incipient development of a lived-in space where the conversation took place.</page><page sequence="26">124 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE 5.2. Moment 2: Anthropomorphizing and Remembering &lt;16&gt; Ricardo: Then your intuition is that no matter how the plane is locat- ed.... &lt;17&gt; Karen: Tilted, it [the slope] should have been zero, because the board is not bending that much that I can see. Of course I don't have that, you know, cannot really see very, very finite [fine] details in the board, such as a computer might. After observing the drawing in Figure 3 and trying to recognize in it a graph of slope vs. distance, Karen shifted its straightness to the fore- ground (&lt;6&gt; - &lt;8&gt;). Perceiving straightness in opposition to bumpiness or curviness, Karen symbolized the apparent straightness of the board with a slope graph that is constant and equal to zero. From this perspective, the slope graph should be insensitive to tilt, because whatever way the board is tilted, it does not make the board bent or bumpy. To produce slope graphs for the contours of the board, Karen tried to figure out what to look at on the board, that is, what quality to notice, highlight, or bring to prominence. She then used the graphs in Figure 7 to discern whether the graphing tool, when producing slope vs. distance graphs, was seeing the board as she did. After examining the board again, in &lt;17&gt;, Karen wondered about the possibility that the computer had seen small bumps that were invisible to her, because the slope graphs were non-zero. In this second moment, we wish to emphasize Karen's comparison between her seeing and the tool's seeing of the same object. In this com- parison, there was a tacit anthropomorphization of the tool. Karen was trying to make sense of and emulate the views of the 'sighted' tool and how they differed from or agreed with hers. We see this bestowing of anthropomorphic qualities upon objects as related to Winnicott's descrip- tions of experiences with transitional objects in which they are treated as animated and sentient. These ways of dealing with transitional objects are natural to a child who is trying to develop a sense of control over life experiences that appear to him out of control and unexplainable, as well as to a child who is 'searching for the self,' (1971, p. 53), that is, attempting to rehearse ways of being and interacting. At the same time, enlivening tools with human qualities is a pervasive response that most of us resort to as we strive to grapple with new tools and new situations. Karen's anthropomorphization of the tool did not express animistic beliefs, but her efforts to ascertain how well her way of recognizing the slope of the board worked, as compared to other possible approaches that she might need to learn. In other words, talking about the tool as sighted was helpful to reflect on the many ways in which she could be seeing the board and the extent to which one of them, based on straightness, made her</page><page sequence="27">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 125 capable of imitating the productions of the graphing instrument. Imagining how the tool 'sees' the slope of the board was a way for Karen to construct the perspective of the tool as it makes slope graphs, by imagining how she could see in the same way as the tool. Anthropomorphizing is one of the ways in which objects and symbols become part of one's lived-in space. The most fundamental quality of whatever dwells in a lived-in space is its being at once internal and external, its being 'me and not-me.' At times something comes to be in a lived-in space by way of remembering. For example, encountering an object that was given to us by a close relative may awaken memories of the time spent together, and then the boundaries between the object as a thing and the object as 'my time with him,' get dissolved: the object is now inhabiting one's lived-in space. There were several moments in which Karen recalled areas of life experience that shaped her intuitions and perspectives: * '- ah, if I could remember the formula' (&lt;4&gt;) * 'it's just a theory they give you.' (&lt; 11 &gt;) * '... Because come to think of it now when we did our velocity graphs [in a physics class at school] ...' (&lt; 19&gt;) Most of these memories were part of her school experience. The first two examples reflected a certain estrangement from the 'they' who cre- ate inapplicable theories and formulas. The third example, on the other hand, expressed her sense of having been in 'unusual' situations in which what appeared to be an increase (walking faster, counting negatives, etc.) 'would go the other way,' in other words, her surprise at realizing that her expectation had only been an 'illusion' ('getting bigger when it isn't'). This latter remembering led her to conjecture a new interpretation for the sign of the slope. These moments of remembering were not mere retrievals of information, but were moments where the feeling or sense of past expe- riences was reawakened. These moments occurred at times of puzzlement, such as in &lt; 19&gt;, when Karen suddenly came upon a memory of another experience with positive and negative graphs that had been puzzling to her, that of using a motion detector to create negative velocity graphs, which also reminded her of counting negative numbers. The common thread con- necting velocity graphs, counting negative numbers, and the negative slope graphs Karen encountered in this interview was not a general mathematical property of signed quantities, but the experience of being perplexed by the illusion that something can be 'getting bigger' when it is also decreasing. Similarly, Karen's earlier remark on the question of why there might be negative slopes: 'Maybe it's just a theory that they give you,' expressed a re-awakening of a way of feeling towards 'theories' given by 'experts' that</page><page sequence="28">126 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE she had experienced before. In this way, Karen's memories emerged as important elements that participated in and transformed her lived-in space. 5.3. Moment 3: Separation, Union and the Emergence of Ways of Symbolizing4 Karen and Ricardo move the tracer along the slanted board from right to left instead of from left to right, Karen looks at the graph that is produced, and says: &lt;27&gt; Karen: Actually, it looks the same. This is a smart computer. Good trick.... The thing is, how does it [the computer] know that we just simply moved it [the tracer] the other way? It must have been something that we did. After Karen began to see slope as a way of symbolizing how steeply the tracer moves up or down, a number of issues came to the forefront for her. One of them was the asymmetry of observing the board from opposite sides, because, by inverting left/right directions, what is a movement upwards as viewed from one side becomes a movement downwards as viewed from the other side. This led Karen to state that one has to keep looking at the board from her side in order to be consistent with the computer. For Karen, the tool and the graphs it produced were specific modes of seeing the board that one has to be aware of. In this example, Karen pondered which side of the board to physically stand on in order to see the board as the computer did. Karen strove to find new ways of seeing the board and of orienting herself in the room by experiencing the board through a perspective that she ascribed to the tool. We would like to focus on the nature of the graph as symbolizing the flat board, and as a transitional object. Flat surfaces like the board Karen worked with are ubiquitous objects in daily life. Some of them can be grabbed with our hands, like a sheet of paper; others are to be walked on, like a street. These frequent experiences with flat surfaces bring with them a certain familiarity. Ordinarily, any of us can turn a flat board in a desired direction or decide whether a given trajectory on a board is upward or downward, without resorting to conjectures or feeling puzzled. However, interpreting graphs produced by the Contour Analyzer involved for Karen a distancing from her everyday experience with flat surfaces. Suppose that one can only sense the 2-dimensional movement of a trac- er on a flat surface. How is it possible, in such a condition, to differentiate between a 180 degree turning of the board and a reversal of the tracing direction along the same board? This is the issue Karen started to grapple with in &lt;29&gt;. Karen's puzzlement reflected what we have called her dis- tancing or separation from common experience with flat surfaces, because</page><page sequence="29">VISUALIZATION AND THE PLACE WHERE WE LIVE 127 in usual circumstances we are not constrained to using a tracer to interpret a surface. In order to make sense of the graphs and the Contour Analyzer, Karen needed to step back from her everyday use of flat surfaces, and reflect on such aspects as how the position of the observer affects the upwardness of a path, how the inversion left/right leaves vertical directions invariant, etc.. While grappling with the graphing tool involved separateness from the familiar use of flat surfaces, it also entailed a new form of relatedness, grounded in an emerging way of symbolizing graphically the height and slope of a board. 6. CONCLUSION In contrast with the frequent analysis of mathematical visualization as an interplay between internal and external representations, it is possible and enriching to study its development in the learner's experiencing of tran- sitional objects and lived-in spaces, including her conversations and play with others. It is in this context that mathematical visualization becomes a 'stepping back' from familiar domains of situations, as well as a genesis of new ways of relating to them expressed in the innovative use of symbols. The reflections on the three 'moments' relate in various ways to the experience of transitional objects. Moment one relates to the fundamental ambiguity about whether the transitional object is external or internal, Moment two to the use of transitional objects to bring into contact a multiplicity of points of view, and Moment three to the idea of transitional phenomena as a 'separation that is a form of union.' This example of 'separation that is a form of union,' inherent in all transitional phenomena, helps us to identify the new 'forms of union' with the emergence of ways of symbolizing. We will broaden this analysis by reflecting on two questions: (1) Does the use of tools always take place in a lived-in space, in a place that is simultaneously internal and external?, and (2) Are tools always used as transitional objects? Addressing the first question, we believe that tool-use always takes place in a lived-in space. To illustrate this thesis, let us recall the famous Heidegger's hammer (Heidegger, 1927/1962). According to Heidegger, what makes the hammer a tool is the hammering. Without hammering, that is, if we just take the hammer as an object to stare at, with certain physical properties and a certain material shape, the hammer is not a tool but a detached thing (in Heidegger's language it is present-at-hand but not ready-at-hand). The hammering - the activity that constitutes the hammer as a tool - is part of a lived-in space; it merges intentions and environmental resources. In hammering, one ceases to distinguish mind</page><page sequence="30">128 RICARDO NEMIROVSKY AND TRACY NOBLE and body, or thought and matter. These distinctions come to the fore only when a 'breakdown' occurs - only then does the hammering stop. Then one strives to analyze what, in the material structure of the hammer or the nail, caused the process to fail. Another example that illustrates this point is that of an archaeologist. Imagine an archaeologist who finds an unusual man-made object. Different studies may cast light on the properties of the object, such as on its chemical composition or its age, but we cannot understand the object as a tool unless we grasp its use, that is, the purpose and environment that the object was part of, which is another way of saying: the place where the people lived. With respect to the second question: 'Are tools always used as tran- sitional objects?', we believe the answer is no. Transitional objects are used temporarily, while the user is trying to work out a certain concep- tual and/or emotional issue. Once the issue ceases to be a problem, the transitional object gradually vanishes. This is our interpretation of Winni- cott's idea that transitional objects do not cease to be used because they are internalized, but because their meaning gets 'dissolved.' In the case of Karen, the Contour Analyzer was important to her while she struggled to create and interpret qualitative slope vs. distance graphs. However, when the graphical shapes became apparent to her, that is, when she developed the ability to 'see' slope vs. distance graphs by visually inspecting a board, the Contour Analyzer became superfluous to her. The Contour Analyzer was instrumental to Karen in trying to learn a new way of looking at flat boards, a point of view that would make their slope graphs apparent. Else- where (Nemirovsky, Tierney, and Wright, forthcoming) we have described this accomplishment as one's development of a tool-perspective, in other words, a new perspective that was temporarily ascribed to the tool - to what the tool sees, knows, etc. - becomes available to us. At the end of the teaching experiment, Karen could chose to adopt a perspective toward flat boards from which slope graphs were salient and visible to her. By bringing to bear life experience and by reflecting on the tool as expressing alternative points of view, Karen experienced the graphical space as a lived-in space populated by the tracing of surfaces, turning of objects, signed graphs in which going down may mean an increase, and so on, as well as an overall approach to seeing flat boards that enabled her to symbolize them in novel and meaningful ways. 7.
