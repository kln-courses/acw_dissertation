THERE does not seem at first sight to be a very close con1- nexion between the Idio-psychological Ethics of Martineau and the theory that huiman values and human purposes permeate and affect even our most remotely cognitive activities. Yet the aim, the method, and the fundamental principles of the great English moralist of the last century are analogous to those of the Humanists; and what the latter are now saying of Truth is very similar to what Dr. Martineau said years ago of Moral Worth. So striking, indeed, is this resemblance that a student of the history of philosophy can hardly fail to connect the new theory of knowledge which Messrs. James and Schiller are at present endeavouring to force upon our notice, with the philosophical standpoint adopted by Martin- eau as the basis of his ethical teaching. If there was one thing in which Martineau believed more firmly than in anything else, it was the dignity of human nature, a dignity which from the outset he conceived to be inseparably bound up in the freedom of man's will. He saw clearly, too, that the materialistic and pseudo-scientific theories of his day meant, not only the downfall of religion, but also the ruin of morality. Consequently he made it his life-work to defend the notions of God, Freedom and Moral Responsibility from the attacks of Sceptic and Positivist. Already, indeed, there stood within the arena of philosophic strife one combatant who had fought strenuously and persist- ently against the common enemy. But abroad Absolutism was discredited; and in England, though defended with all the ardour of converts by those who had taken up the Kantian 21</page><page sequence="2">306 LESLIE J. WALKER: position, it was already showing signs of' disintegration-the inevitable mark of error and decay. A philosophy of the Ab- solute with the scant respect it shows for the personality of man, whom it seems to reduce to a mere functionf of a uni- versal Consciousness, could never satisfy, nay, must ever evoke a protest from a mind such as that of Martineau scarcely less vigorous than that which was aroused by Scepticism. In truth, Martineau's philosophy is, like Humanism, a re-, action against Absolutism as well as against Materialism and Scepticism; and like Humanism, too, it marks a return to the human point of view. As opposed to belief in a universal and intrinsic Ground, both philosophies are individualistic; and, instead of looking at the universe from the standpoint -of an Eternal Ego, both prefer to take as their basis the inner life of man. Martineau, indeed, does not go so far as to adopt the Protagorean principle that 'man is the measure of all things'-a principle which Mr. Schiller and his friends have borrowed from a bygone age and taken as their watchword, but he does maintain that the morality of human conduct is determined solely by human needs and human springs of action. Idio-psychological Ethics, in fact, are so called precisely because they are founded on an introspective study of man's 'nature as revealed in his own self-consciousness. They are opposed to anything which begins with a study of Nature or of God ab extrinseco. And the Humanists, or Pragmatists- for practically the names are synonymous-are only applying the same principle to the Theory of Knowledge when they assert that Truth also is a 'value' which depends for its specific nature upon the purposes and needs that govern and direct our thinking. Man is prone to generalise; and, when onace the psychological method had been applied to those "unique and unanalysable qualities " ' right' and 'wrong' which we predicate of our actions, one can hardly be surprised that others should extend its use to the parallel, and, so it is said, equally unique and unanalysable conceptions of the 'true ' and the ' false '. .At any rate, Martineau and the Humanists both adopt the psychological method-and the psychological point of view. Both are convinced-explain the facts how you may-that in man alone is to be found the clue to the universe in which we live; and though the former never attempted to apply the method to cognition in general, he has at least built up by its means that system of Morality which he propounds in the second volume of his now famous Types of Ethical Theory. .Martineau starts with a psychological analysis of our moral</page><page sequence="3">MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. 307 consciousness, and finds that there are within us certain creative impulses or springs of action, which he divides into four kinds, vTz., Organic Appetites and the impulse to un- selective physical activity in general; Passions,-antipathy, fear, anger; Affections,-parental, social, and compassionate; Sentiments,-wonder, admiration, reverence. These four kinds of impulse are connatural and instinctive; and are styled ' Primary Springs of Action,' since it is from them that all more complex and interested springs are supposed to be developed, and from both that all action proceeds. They are essentially conative, being, in fact, 'the dynamic sources of action within the mind'. In its origin a spring consists merely in an impulse toward ' an unselected form of activity,' an indeterminate striving in which we are impelled by some inner need toward an end of which we have at most but a dim awareness. But with the satisfaction of its vaguely-felt demands the spring becomes inore clearly defined. Pleasure, too, ensues, and is remembered; so that when a spring which has once attained its end, is re-aroused, there arises with it a pre-conception of the experience to which it led, and this experience is added on as an idea to the spring of action, and itself becomes an end. In this way secondary springs arise; and what was formerly 'a movement of mere need now becomes a movement of desire'. Thus the Organic Propensions give rise to the love of money, pleasure and power; the Passions to malice, vindictiveness and suspicious- ness; the Affections to sentimentality; the Sentiments to the love of self-culture, mestheticism, and interest in religion. These 'springs of action,' essential to Martineau's system since they lie at the foundation of his theory of Morality, oc- cupy in Humanism a place no less important. These same conative tendencies of our nature, expressive of our human needs and purposes, constitute for the Humanist the forms which we seek to impose upon the plasticity of matter, the ideals which we ever strive to realise in the concrete. At first vague and indefinite, their significance manifests itself more and more clearly with the growth of experience; while their primary aim throughout is action, action which shall enable us to live by fashioning our environment to suit our needs. The emphasis which both Martineau and the Humanists thus lay upon conation, marks a reaction in favour of the vo- litional side of our nature. In Absolutism volition and the emotions are subordinated to Thought, which, as synony- mous with Being, constitutes the Universe. Against this identification of our nature with one of its functions Martin-</page><page sequence="4">308 LESLIE J. WALKER: eau and the Humanists alike protest, and, as is usually the case in reactionary movements, tend to go to the other ex- treme and subordinate thought to volition. The intellect, for example, in Idio-psychological Ethics is concerned chiefly with ways and means and is not the Moral Faculty; while in Humanism it is wholly subservient to action, the love of knowledge as such there becoming, like the love of pleasure, a secondary and derived impulse. As yet, however, we have not touched on the question of Morality proper. Morality, according to Martineau, is based on 'Moral Worth,' a peculiar quality of the springs of action, which are therefore the proper objects of moral judgment. Bentham's 'motive and intention,' the Scholastic 'object, end, and circumstance' are made to depend for their morality in this view upon the different springs which they call into operation, and which range themselves as 'persuasives' or 'dissuasives' in regard to any contemplated line of conduct. "Threats are converted into fears, and bribes into covetous- ness, while both are confronted by the internal affections, compassion, a sense of justice, and a reverence for right." Over all these springs conscience presides, sometimes declaring in favour of the persuasives, sometimes in favour of the dissuasives, according to their relative moral worth. Morality, therefore, necessarily implies choice and is impos- sible without the simultaneous presence of at least two con- flicting springs of action, between which we are free to choose. Moral choice, however, must not be confused with Pru- dential choice, for Prudential or Hedonistic choice is based merely on 'iResultant pleasure,' i.e. on the pleasure of suc- cessful or realised impulse which can vary in quantity only, not in -kind. A choice of this sort is really no choice at all, but at bottom nothing more nor less than 'self-surrender to the strongest impulse'. Moral choice, on the other hand, is 9 genuine choice. To be moral we must be free to follow the prudential or the ethical promptings of our nature, we must be at liberty to obey the strongest or the highest motive. Similarly the Humanist teaches that to acquire knowledge we must be free to act in different ways and on different hypotheses or postulates in order to learn by experience which of them will enable us to deal mnost satisfactorily with our surroundings. Morality and knowledge are alike con- ditioned by the possibility of voluntary choice; and just as thd transition from the non-moral to the moral state occurs where spontaneity gives place to free volition, so the transi- tion from mere sense-experiefice to cognition occurs when blind striving is superseded by'selective action.</page><page sequence="5">MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. 309 Relativity, too, is characteristic both of 'Moral Worth ' and of Humanistic Truth. Moral Worth, we are told, can no more belong to one spring alone than " fraternity can belong to a solitary man, or a convex surface present itself without a concave ". " It is inherent in a conflicting pair of springs as in a dual object, and not only could not be cognised, but does not even exist till they fall in combination. No spring has any definite moral value of its own, but merely a relative value which belongs to it only when some other spring is aroused to dispute its claim to control the course of action." Hence, the Moral Worth of any one spring depends for its specific nature upon the particular spring with which for the moment it happens to conflict; in itself no spring is either good or bad. No less emphatic is the Humanist in denying the exis- tence of absolute Truth. Truth, he says, belongs to a pro- position or hypothesis only in so far as it serves our human purposes better than some alternative proposition or hypothe- sis. It is a value which is entirely dependent upon its power to satisfy human needs. Since, then, our needs may change, and are never completely satisfied, there is no theory in science and no axiom in philosophy which may not be so modified at some future date as to render our present con- ception of it not oinly inadequate but false. Now, from the relativity of Moral Worth, Martineau infers that in his system. 'a graduated scale of Excellence' must take the place of that co-ordination and classification of the virtues which we find in other systems; and a like conse- quence would seem to follow in regard to the relativity of truth. This the Humanist admits, but as yet he has made no attempt to carry his theory into practice. The careful analysis and classification of springs of action, so character- istic of Martineau's system, is absent in Humanism. There is no analysis, no comparison, no classification of the pur- poses and needs which control our cognitive processes; nor are we as yet provided with even a tentative scale of 'Utility' or 'Workaibility,' which can be applied to theories, laws and axioms. Yet a scale of cognitive values and a table of the relative urgency of different needs would seem to be of vital importance if all truth is relative and if the needs by which it is determined are so numerous and so different. It may be pleaded in reply,-perhaps, that Humanism is yet in its infancy, and that there has been no time to examine its working in detail. But 'the fact of the matter is that while Martineau found it difficult enough to distinguish and classify springs of action with a view to arranging them in a scale of moral excellence, it would be still more difficult, if not im-</page><page sequence="6">310 LESLIE J.. WALKER: possible, for the Humanist to construct a corresponding scale from the point of view of the theory of Knowledge. If we compare the Humanist definition of Truth with Martineau's definition of Moral Worth, the chief difference between them is apparently this, that whereas the good is that which satisfies the highest spring, the true is that which yields the greatest sum of satisfactions. (Truth in this sense ig not, of course, the Truth in which Martineau believed-his 'Humanism' was merely a moral Humanism;-but it ig Truth for the Humanist.) The ' sum of satisfactions' which is here laid down as the criterion of truth, makes it practic'ally impossible to estimate relative Truth. Martineau found it impossible. to classify complex springs of action, and omitted them altogether from his tabulated scale of Excellence; but for the Humanist all springs are complex, and a theory to be true must satisfy all our needs. Moreover, we have, or are supposed to have, an intuitive judgment of the Relative Moral Worth of'different springs, but no such judgment can be appealed to in the case of truth-values. Again, for the comparison of the truth-values of propositions, theories and such-like 'claims to truth,' a preliminary scale setting forth the relative importance of different satisfactions, is needed. Not even this, however, has so far been attempted, nor does there seem much chance of it being successfully drawn up, especially while there is so much difference of opinion in re- gard to the rank of 'iintellectual satisfactions'. And even if we suppose the difficulty of settling the rank of various satis- factions to bave been surmounted, what Martineau says of a scale of ethical principles is equally true in the sphere of knowledge, namely, that it is only when " the cycle of orig- inal experiences has completed itself, when all the internal springs of action have had their mutual play and exhausted their series of permutations," that there will be resources for forming a scale of relative values., Since, then, experience is ever growing, and the permutations and combinations of hypotheses, principles, and laws is ever increasing in number and variety, a scale of truth-values, if such could be con-- structed at all, would still be tentative only, and always liable to modification. Yet, in spite of all this, a scale of some- kind is indispensable for the theory of knowledge, if we accept the pragmatic doctrine that 'truth is made by postulation in accordance with our needs and by verification through ex- periences which satisfy those needs; because, until it is com- pleted, and the propositions, laws and theories which are to occupy the highest place determined, truth will be nothing more than probability'.</page><page sequence="7">MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. 311 A volitional theory of Knowledge and Morality thus in- volves the relativity of both truth-values and moral-values to one another together with the negation of all absolute criteria, in place of which a table of such values must needs be substituted. But it involves more than this. From the assertion that truth and morality are determined by our needs, or by the dynamic sources of action within the mind, there follows another kind of relativity, namely, relativity to the self-conscious ego that strives to realise its needs in thought and in action-a relativity which we usually term Subjec- tivism. Martineau would doubtless have vigorously repudiated this consequence of his theory. Yet he declares that Moral- ity is a 'Value,' and a value, though unique and irresolvable, must be a value for something. Since, then, Moral Worth belongs strictly to springs of action which correspond to and are expressive of our needs, that something would seem to be the need which the authoritative and categorical judgment of conscience pronounces to be relatively more urgent or more fundamental. But, if this be so, since our needs are sub- jective, and since effect and circumstance are carefully ex- cluded by Martineau from the sphere of morality proper, moral right and moral wrong, being determined by subjective conditions, must also be subjective. In the same way it follows that Truth is subjective, if once we grant that all our cognitive activities are intrinsically modified by our purposes and needs, and that it is impossible to distinguish in the content of thought that which is due to the object from that which is due to the mind. For, in this case, we can make no allowance for the mental or personal element, so that thought will be essentially anthropomorphic in 'content' as'well as in ' character'. And if, in addition to this, we grant Dr. Schiller's postulate in regard to the evolution of knowledge, viz., that it is we ourselves, as pur- posively active beings, who have imposed and do impose upon matter those forms which we are accustomed to attribute to the object; that matter was originally wholly indeterminate and plastic; and that the 'common world' in which we believe, has been built up solely by the action and interaction of the minds of men and of the ancestors from whom they have been evolved; then, for us Truth will be purely subjective, a m-ental product which is made and not found or learned from objects; and which is expressive, 'therefore, not of the qualities and essences of external things, but of the Ego itself with its characteristic functions and its need-expressive purposes.</page><page sequence="8">312 LESLIE J. WALKER: A denial of the objective validity of Truth is thus the inevitable outcome of the theory that Truth is a value whose content is determined by subjective conditions, just as an Ethical Subjectivism is the necessary consequence of the cor- responding doctrine that the real objects of moral judgment are the springs of conduct whose 'worth' is determined by conscience on purely internal grounds. And though the Humanist may appeal to a,n Arbeits-welt, or to the common consent of humanity in general and of experts in particular, and Martineau to a Divine Being who manifests Himself in conscience and so confers upon its dictates unanimity, universality, and objectivity; yet neither can by this means restore to his theory the validity which his subjectivism has taken away. For a 'common world' which has been built up by the intercourse of different minds will be neither more nor less subjective than the elements of which it is composed. Different thinkers may agree to accept certain 'claims to truth' and to reject others, but unanimity so secured bespeaks merely similarity in mental structure, nothing more. And Martineau's appeal -to 'the Voice of God' if it proves any- thing at all, proves too much. For, apart from the Deus ex mcachina implied in such an answer, it postulates a closer union with God than facts will vouch for, and savours of On- tologism, if not of something an individualist like Martineau would have considered far more erroneous, Absolutism. There are, in fact, it seems to me, only two ways out of the difficulty, either a return to Absolutism or a return to Aris- totle. The first alternative would provide a common Ground which, by an immanent revelation of Itself in finite centres of consciousness, would secure an approximate conformity of their thinking to its own, and would Itself provide an object tive type or ideal which they were ever striving to realise in themselves. The second would give to Morality and Truth objective validity by making their content depend upon de- termination by objective entities and their relations. Either alternative, however, involves the surrender of the psycho- logical method in part at least. Aristotelian and Absolutist are agreed that the knowledge of Subject and Object is im- mediate and is simultaneously developed. We can no more infer the nature of objects from the knowledge we possess of our own inner life, as the Idio-psychological method claims to do, than we can apply our knowledge of objective laws unreservedly to the- self-conscious activity of the Ego. Absolutism, however, goes further than this. It asserts -not only that in knowledge subject and object imply one an- other and are essentially relative, but that the relation be-</page><page sequence="9">MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. 313 tween them is intrinsic and constitutive in a metaphysical sense. Knowledge is but one aspect of the Whole. Nature, man, and God, are not merely in essential relation, but are ontologi- cally continuous, and, at bottom, one and the same. Now, it is by no means the same thing to say that a subject implies an object, and an object a subject, as to say that Object apart from Subject, or Subject apart from Object, have no entity at all. The latter assertion seems to me to imply, as it did ,to Martineau, a pantheistic unity. Consequently, though the Absolutist solution is - a possible one if considered in the ab- stract, and has actually been suggested by Prof. Jones in his centenary Lecture on Dr. Martineau as the natural com- plement to the Ethical principles of the latter, it is a solu- tion which secures objectivity at the cost of both personality and freedom. Prof. Jones, of course, does not admit this conclusion; he even assures us that he would renounce his Idealism if he thought it involved such a consequence. Yet it is difficult to see how personality and freedom are to be saved if 'All' is reducible to One, and if the 'differences' of that one are, in reality, but immanent and intrinsic modifica- tions or manifestations of Itself. Since, then, personality and freedom are so dear alike to Martineau and to the Humanist, they would, I think, prefer to make any sacrifice rather than take refuge in Absolutism. The alternative solution - a return to Aristotle - would seem, therefore, at least to merit consideration. It, too, de- mands a sacrifice; but it does not involve the surrender of any notion so fundamental as those of personality and free- dom. An Aristotelian Philosophy gives to both a full and real significance, and at the same time, is willing to grant that springs of action are to some extent determinants of morality, and that human needs and human purposes at any rate condition and direct the cognitive activities by which Truth is attained. But it does not make the springs of ac- tion either the sole determinants of morality or the proper ob- jects of nioral judgment, nor does it assign to human needs and purposes a predominant and exclusive influence in the determination of Truth. On the contrary, it insists that to the object must be allotted its proper place both in the sphere of knowledge and in the sphere of morality; and, in doing so, it is only reasserting on behalf of the object a right which common sense has always recognised. In the first place, Common Sense never makes the spring of action the object of its moral judgments, as witness the strangeness with which these judgments strike us when ex- pressed in such a way as to make them harinonise with</page><page sequence="10">314 LESLIE J. WALKER: Martineau's theory. We are told, for instance, that " a child, ,not above the seduction of the jam-closet, finding himself in that too trying place and succumbing to temptation, has; scarcely sucked the traces from his fingers before he is ready to sink into the earth with compunction, well know- ing that the appetite he has indulged is meaner than the integrity he has violated" (p. 45). Or again, it is said that " When historians tell us of the plague-tainted city in which panic-stricken men and women herd together and drive away terror by drunken carouse and ribald song, we are ap- palled to think of appealing to as low a pleasure against so august a fear" (p. 45). Now, what child, I would ask, ever compares his appetite with his integrity, or what man con- demns the revelry of plague-stricken multitudes because it implies that pleasure has been preferred to fear? Or, if you wish to put the question to a practical test, ask a friend on what grounds he condeinns, say, Hooliganism. He may reply, as it were intuitively, that violently to disturb the equilibrium of a peaceful wayfarer, to pounce upon him, and generally maltreat him, is on the face of it immoral; or he may tell you that Hooliganism is an infringement of the liberty of citizens. He may remind you of the precept, 'DDo unto others as you would be done by'; or he may enlarge upon the disastrous effects such actions would, if permitted, be likely to have upon society at large. But I doubt whether Socrates himself could elicit from him the answer that Hooli- ganism is immoral because it is prompted by vindictiveness or love of power, which impulses, when in conflict with social affection, ought not to be allowed to control our actions. We do at times approve and condemn motives. But a motive signifies an end in view, some action, some effect, or some state of cons6iousness, which we seek to realise, and- not an impulse or spring of action. Springs of action, if condemned at all, are condemned because they prompt to inordinate ac- tions, actions which lie outside the natural and appropriate sphere of influence, so to speak, of the- Spring. And this sphere of influence is determined not relatively, but absolutely; not intuitively, but on extrinsic grounds which take into con- sideration object, end and circumstance. Common Sense, then, is opposed to a Preferential Moral- ity based on the relative worth of springs of action, and it is no less opposed to the Humanist doctrine of Relative Truth depending upon its power to satisfy human needs. Take any book on Science, Philosophy, or Morals. Why do we accept or reject, approve or condemn, the theories and prin- ciples advanced by its author.? Our decision is based on</page><page sequence="11">MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. 315, intellectual grounds, not on emotional or volitional considera- tions. We do not ask what emotional satisfaction the work in question may arouse within us-that will depend largely on its style; nor do we ask whether the author has proved what we wanted him to prove. We examine the accuracy and care with which experimental data have been collected and arranged; we ask ourselves whether the reasoning is valid, whether conclusions follow logically from their pre- mises. We look out for obscurities, contradictions, un- warranted assumptions, ambiguities in the use of terms. We consider the bearing of the theories advanced upon other accepted theories in the same and also in other spheres of knowledge. This done, if the work as a whole and each part of the work is clear and convincing, we accept its doctrines as true; otherwise we reject them individually or en masse as false or at leas-t unproven. And throughout the process, if it is truth that we are seeking, we shall exclude as far as possible the influence of our emotions and- our will, and strive to found our judgment solely on objective evidence, i.e. on the evidence of the things themselves which are there discussed, as they present and reveal themselves to our in- tellects. Again, our assent, if given at all, will be given un- conditionally. Decisions in matters of fact and of the explanation of fact are as a rule absolute, not relative. When we compare one theory with another and say that ' this ' is more satisfactory than 'that,' or that 'this' works better than 'that,' we mean that, though there is not sufficient evidence to convince us of the truth of either, yet one has more evidence in its favour than the other; it works better, in the sense of being more consistent in itself, with fact and with accepted truths. The Pragmatist is compelled reluctantly to admit the ap- parent 'absoluteness' of some truths, viz., of axiomatic truths; but, in order to make his principles universally applicable, he assigns to these a postulatory origin in a pre- historic past. So drastic a reform in philosophical ideas re- quires some justification. On what grounds, then, does the Humanist place himself in open antagonism to the philosophy of common-sense? Why does he despise the claims of the object? Why strive to recast Truth, as Martineau recast Morality, in a subjective mould? The arguments of both are psychological. It was introspection that laid bare the ultimate and dynamic sources of action within the mind, and it is introspection that has revealed the thoroughly purposive nature of all cognition. Now, in Martineau's case it would seem that his introspec-</page><page sequence="12">316 LESLIE J. WALKER: tion was at fault. Moralists, with few exceptions, agree with Prof. Sidgwick that the object of moral judgment is not the spring, but the contemplated action itself together with its foreseen effects-' effects' here signifying 'every change internal or external, immediate or indirect, which in given circumstances may be expected to result from the volition'. Martineau seems, in fact, to have confused the dynamic source of action within the mind with the deter- minant of action. We may grant for the sake of argument that the springs are not as in mnany cases they appear to be, mere class-names for various kinds of action, and it will yet be true that the real determinant of all volition proper is the idea of the action to be performed and of its consequences, since it is this idea which controls and directs, in any particular case,. the spring's specific mode of activity. Parental love, for instance, may be aroused in the mother by the sight of her suffering child. But the activity which results will be indeterminate, unless there are also present to the mind&amp;general ideas (e.g.) of the consequences of exposure to cold and of the efficiency of clothing, and particular ideas and images connected with the means of providing for the wants of youth; and it is these ideas of effects and means in particular circumstances which really determine action-a view that is strongly confirmed by modern psychological ex- periment, which tends to show that not only every idea but every.sensation has at least some dynamo-genetic or psycho- motive force. The springs themselves being thus indeterminate, their morality must be of a like nature. Hence, to treat of them in a special Ethics from which object, end and circumstance are excluded as unaffecting their morality, or indeed, to predicate of them Moral Worth at all, is to take a narrow and one-sided view of Morality. It is irrational to separate the 'Ethics of Character " from the 'Ethics of Conduct,' for it-is by condTuct that character is to a large extent built up. What we are is doubtless- more important from a moral standpoint than what we do, but nevertheless it is what we do that chiefly makes us what we are. A theory of Morals, therefore, which refuses to treat of Conduct, and declines to admit the object as a -determinant of morality is inadequate and false. It is useless to urge that as the spring changes the Morality changes, for it is equally true that as the ' foreseen effects' change the morality changes. The question cannot be thus summarily. dismissed, by an appeal to Mill's Method of Concomitant Variations. The moral value of object, end and circumstance must be taken into consideration; and were it</page><page sequence="13">MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. 317 not that Martineau in constructing his Scale of Excellence has in reality allowed their influence to weigh with him, his results would have been far more at variance with Common- Sense Morality than they actually are. A similar criticism may be passed on the Humanist. His theory of truth is based on a psychological analysis of cog- nition. And just as Martineau confuses the dynamic sources of action with the determinants of morality, so he confuses the dynamic sources of cognition with the determinants of truth. Our needs certainly prompt us to seek knowledge and truth, and our purposes determine what kind of truth it is we seek. But neither purposes nor needs determine what we find to be the truth. Only the intent of thought is de- termined by them, not its content. As the Humanist says, we frame hypotheses, and seek in Nature their confirmation. But an hypothesis should not, and as a rule does not cause us to mutilate facts, nor do we reject facts which fail to har- monise with our hypotheses. On the contrary, the validity of hypotheses depends entirely upon whether experience will confirm them; in other words, it depends upon whether the nature of objects when apprehended by the mind agrees or disagrees with what we supposed their nature to be. Know- ledge is essentially knowledge of objects, and were it impos- sible for the object to determine thought, cognition in the strict sense of the word would be non-existent. Sometimes, it is true, subjective conditions, prejudices, preconceived no- tions, habitual associations, do affect and may even wholly determine the content of thought. But they do so per ac- cidens, and at the cost of truth; so that when we have reason to suspect that such influences have been at work we feel bound to discard our conclusions as false, or at any rate doubtful. The Humanist is right, in saying that all thought is purposive. We might even concede to him that in a sense 'human needs and human purposes permeate even our most remotely cognitive activities'. But he is wrong in inferring from this that the content of thought is affected by our pur- poses and needs, except in so far as they decide what ques- tions we ask and what answers we expect. The answers as such, are determined solely by the object. Often enough they fail to satisfy our purposes and invalidate altogether our hypotheses, so that we have to start again on new lines, and look for other explanations which will better harmonise with our facts. Again, in the inferences which the Humanist draws from his psychological analyses, he is, like Martineau, led astray by his exaggerated esteem for the dignity and all-pervading</page><page sequence="14">LESLIE J. WALKER: influence of human personality. This it is which has caused him to neglect the real significance of the object in knowledge, and this it is, too, which has caused him to overlook the fact that knowledge is mediated not only by sensory images but by intellectual ideas, the species intelligibiles rei without which the nature of object could never be apprehended. In his energetic contempt for the pure and passionless 'thought' of the Absolute, he practically dispenses with intellect. The reaction against Intellectualism which Humanism embodies, is so violent that the functions of thought proper have been lost sight of and man is pragmatically identified with the -volitional and emotional side of his nature. Dr. Schiller de- scribes the intellect as 'a bundle of habits partly cognitive and partly volitional,' and Prof. James maintains that all ideas are but useful symbols, which, like the 'faint copies ' of Hume are valid onlv if verified by sensations. Sense-experi- ences and symbolic processes together make up our cognitive apparatus: there is no need of intellectual apprehension. The correspondence-notion of truth is abolished once for all. Truth consists in experiences which satisfy our needs, and in symbolic reasonings which lead to suich experiences. Experi- ence and experiment, it is admitted, imply reaction on the part of the object. But why reaction upon a rational being should not result in intellectual ideas as well as sense-im- pressions, or how sense-impressions alone can give us any- thing worthy of the name of knowledge, we are -not told. Absolutism exaggerated the function of the intellect; con- sequently the intellect must be degraded and belittled, if only to annoy the Absolutist. Martineau, too, attacks the jurisdiction of the intellect. Though a firm believer in 'faculties' and in the specific dif- ference between intellect and sense, he denies that intellect is a moral faculty. His arguments are far more clear and his use of terms far more precise than those of Humanism, which, despite its origin in the pragmatic principle of Peirce, is prone to ambiguity. " The knowledge which we have of relative right and wrong in the springs of action is," he says, "a -unique and irresolvable kind of knowledge, introducing us to a quality neither given in perception nor accessible.by infer- ences, and therefore requiring a special word to denote the function of our nature which secures its presence" (p. 407). Tthe intellect has nothing whatever to say in regard to Moral Worth. By no process of reasoning could it ever arrive at anything beyond the 'true' as opposed to the 'right'. The reasoning here is easily understood; but is it valid?</page><page sequence="15">MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. 319 G1ranted that our notions of right and wrong are unique and irresolvable; that they cannot be analysed into a genus 'con- formity' and a difference 'in regard to our rational nature as a whole,' or a genus ' fitness' and a difference 'for the attain- ment of our ultimate end'; granted that they are neither "given in perception nor accessible by inference" from the relation between God and man, between Creator and creature; I still think that though a special word mnay be convenient, a special function of our nature is not required to secure the presence of these unique and irresolvable notions, if such they be. Turn to any work on Metaphysics and you will find many such notions, 'being,' 'necessity,' 'cause,' ' possibility,' and the like. Why, then, should it be necessary to postulate a special Moral Faculty to give us the notions of right and wrong? There is, moreover, a department of Ethics in which the intellect does exercise jurisdiction. Conscience in- forms us only of the relative superiority of impulse over im- pulse. It tells us, for instance, that Social Affection is to be preferred to the 'Love of Ease,' but it does not tell us in what Social Affection consists. It is by the intellect that the -proper object or sphere of action of each spring is decided; and the intellect has also to settle all questions as to the quantitative limits of the springs, and as to the proper means for securing to them-n the fullest activity. Such questions, however, are said to be 'beyond the resources of morality proper,' and are referred to a subsidiary rule, the Canon of Consequences, which is 'rather of an intellectual than of a moral nature,' and does not involve guilt, if disobeyed. Yet quantitative variations and the means by which we further the activity of the springs may affect their morality. We should condemn a father who through unbridled generosity to public institutions, beggared his own children, and we may question the morality of granting immunity to the criminal who turns King's Evidence. If, then, a spring is immoral when its activity is inordinate, or when the means by which it seeks to realise itself are themselves imnmoral, surely the Canon of Consequences is essential to right moral judgment, and Reason has as good a claim as Conscience to be called the Moral Faculty. Intellectualism exaggerates the functions of thought; Martineau and the Humanists, unduly curtail them; and confuse them with the functions of sense. They err by go- ing to the opposite extreme. Man's faculties must neither be multiplied unnecessarily, nor yet must they be identified one with another or absorbed in the unity of human person- ality. Yet the fact that Martineau is as much the enemy of.</page><page sequence="16">320 LESLIE J. WALKER: MARTINEAU AND THE HUMANISTS. Intellectualism in Ethics as the Humanist is its enemy in Epistemology, is significant, and is due to a similar cause, partly to his Voluntarism and partly to his rejection of the objeptive point of view. It is impossible to say how much Humanists and Pragmatists have learnt from the late Dr. Martineau; but this at least is clear, that they are at one with him in their methods and their aims. His Ethical Studies and their Theory of Knowledge are expressive of' the same movement of thought, a movement which leads us away from Absolutism towards Individualism and toward a, philosophy whose standpoint shall be at once more practical and more human. Such a movement was needed as a protest against those philosophers who persist in treating man as a mere passing wavelet in the sea of an eternal con- sciousness. Buit for a permanent philosophical position we need a via media which shall give to subject and object alike their due value in knowledge and morality; and such a, via media, it seems to me, can be found only in a return to the principles which constitute the essential character- istics of the philosophy of Aristotle.</page></plain_text>
