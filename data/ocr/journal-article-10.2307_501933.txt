<plain_text><page sequence="1">News Letter from Rome' A. W. VAN BUREN PLATES 111-112 The archaeological news to be transmitted from Italy for the years 1966-1967 is overshadowed by the heavy floods in early November which caused irreparable damage to the cultural patrimony, espe- cially in Florence. A preliminary report by Mr. John Shearman appeared in The Times of London of Nov. 23, I966; an illustrated article in ILN Nov. 23; a fuller, illustrated account by Kyle M. Phil- lips, Jr., in AJA 71 (1967) II3, pls. A-C; and there was the urgent illustrated appeal of the Etruscan Foundation of Detroit. The anxiety aroused by the disaster is shared by several sectors of the community; in particular, the importance of the Florentine archives for the documentation of cer- tain phases of the art of the Renaissance has long been familiar, especially in America, from the studies devoted by the late Professor Allan Mar- quand to the products of the various members of the Della Robbia family. These studies benefited from the detailed archival researches of Rufus Graves Mather, which that exemplary investigator was eventually to describe in his aureus libellus, Excavating Buried Treasure (Harvard University Press 1945). For the topography of RoME itself, the most important news2 comes from the outskirts of Trajan's great baths on the Oppian-several peri- ods of elaborate edifices which when completely uncovered and adequately studied should consti- tute a considerable addition to the publishable plan of the ancient city. In this field at least of science, absolute completeness and certitude are rarely attainable. Specialists in the topography of the city of Rome are conscious of certain monu- ments or areas which are roughly assignable but which have not as yet been definitely identified with the precision implied by some of the maps and plans in current circulation. Thus the Porticus Vipsania, with its memories of a great commander and administrator, still eludes precise identifica- tion in the restricted space to the northeast of the present Piazza Colonna. Less clearly defined limits bound the area available for a more regrettable manifestation of the Roman mentality, the Cam- pus Sceleratus, assignable to the space roughly ex- tending inside the Colline Gate of the Servian Wall.' The news from CAMPANIA, generously communi- cated by the present Soprintendente, Professor Al- fonso de Franciscis, is fully commensurate with the historical and cultural significance of the area and the traditions of its Soprintendenza. Limita- tions of space permit the mention here of only a few outstanding details. The energies of the administration have been in large part preempted by measures required to counteract the deterioration and threatened col- lapse of portions of the edifices of Pompeii and Herculaneum which had been restored in former years with the technique then available: especially the tribunal of the Basilica of Pompeii, which was threatening total collapse and which in conse- quence it proved necessary to dismantle completely and to reconstruct as a single cohesive unit. In regard to numerous houses, including several of the best known, advantage was taken of the neces- sity of replacing deteriorating supports-wooden beams or rafters-to achieve a juster approximation to the original cubic capacity and proportions. Apart from this, the newly uncovered areas of Pompeii include, as an outstanding feature, the House of Julius Polybius, to the clearing of which a portion of the funds of the international organ- ization of the Amici di Pompei has been allocated. Members of that meritorious body who visit the buried city in future will thus have the opportu- nity) to behold, and appraise, the outcome of their farsighted benefactions. At Cumae, further clearing of the civic center of the Hellenistic and Roman period has been ef- fected; and the same was accomplished on the fringes of the great therapeutic establishment at 1 The most recent installment of these reports appeared in AJA 70 (1966) 349-361, pls. 83-88.

But to return to the areas buried by the great eruption of Vesuvius: progress is slow with that vast undertaking, the excavation of Hercu- laneum, owing to the special conditions at that site. The further uncovering of the Decumanus Maximus, however, has revealed along its north side the front of an edifice with a colonnade on its ground floor and some small rooms on the upper storey. Of its supporting beams consider- able portions survive, and it may prove feasible with present techniques to consolidate them and thus to preserve them intact. A special cultural and architectural feature of all or most Italian communities under the late Re- public and the Empire was the theater. The lower parts of such an edifice have been uncovered dur- ing some building undertakings at ALIFE, the ancient ALLIFAE, where it is hoped that it may prove possible to preserve them in the basement of the structure now being erected: they pertain to the cavea, of the Sullan period, and to the scaena, which in its present form belongs to the Augustan age. The former, more than semicircular in plan, in its inner part is set upon a solid block, but toward the exterior rested on radial stone walls. The pulpitum was of the normal type, with curved and rectilinear niches, while the scaenae frons, of brickwork, showed a curved niche be- tween two rectilinear ones. The fragments dis- covered of its decoration include some limestone carvings from the podium, a togate torso and two portrait heads of the Augustan period. Campania is rich in burial grounds, and normal respect for the sleep of the dead is gradually giv- ing way to the claims of science or to the insist- ence of more material considerations.4 The num- ber of cemeteries the inventories of which repre- sent the culture of early periods has been increased by recent discoveries at Capua (additional areas) and Calatia in the interior, and Vico Equense on the Sorrento promontory. The classical Greek and Roman periods are also well represented in the freshly acquired grave inventories. Sculpture of the classical period is represented by a replica of the "Apollo of the Omphalos" found in the bath establishment at Baiae; while the Naples Museum has now completed its installa- tion of the Roman portrait statues that were found at Formiae in 1920. Specialists in the history of painting and a wider public of visitors to the upper floors of the Naples Museum have long been familiar with the small group of miniature paintings on marble panels there exhibited.5 These have now been joined by four more examples of the same unusual tech- nique: one bears the representation of Hercules and the Nemean Lion, another a Centaur, the third a female figure enthroned and a standing youth; a fourth, reduced to a ruinous state but showing traces of figures and architecture, bears the artist's signature, 'AXE'av8poa 'AO-qvato0 EypaqhEv which repeats information already de- rived from one of the previously available members of the group. A previous News Letter" reported the finding, at the establishment of physicians at Velia, the Greek Elea, of a headless herm inscribed with the name of the great Parmenides. The testimony to the founder of the Eleatic School has now been com- pleted through the finding of a white marble head which fits the shaft-when published, this should prove a welcome addition to the small reper- tory of Greek portraits attested by inscriptions. Again the Roman daily press renders valuable service: II Tempo, Nov. 2, 1966. Readers of Pausanias' Description of Greece and Cicero's Verrine Orations are aware of the impor- tant part played in the religious life of the people by the cult statues. Of these, few have survived intact or nearly so, representative of the art and culture of Magna Graecia and Sicily. The "Seated Goddess" of the Berlin Museums is now generally assigned to Tarentum, whereas grave doubts have been expressed as to the genuineness of its present companion, the "Standing Goddess." Thus all the greater interest attaches to a discovery which took place in 1961 at the present UGENTO, ancient UXENTUM, in the extreme southeastern projection of the peninsula, an account of which has now appeared in print:' a bronze statue, some three feet tall, of a nude male figure with right arm raised as if to brandish a weapon. The art appears provincial. This important object has now entered the possession of the Italian state, has been taken for reconditioning to the Istituto Centrale di Ri- storo in Rome, and eventually should find a home in the Taranto Museum. As to the areas of the Italian peninsula to the 4 F. von Duhn and F. Messerschmidt, Italische Grdberkunde I, 533-557. 5 L.

Few archaeological sites in Italy have passed through so many and varied vicissitudes as CER- VETERI (CERVETRI, ancient CAERE): its name is asso- ciated with some outstanding pieces in the mu- seums of several nations (even though the terra- cotta reclining pair in the British Museum have now been withdrawn from exhibition for reasons which do not fall within the sphere of the present report), and its interpretation has evoked a con- siderable literature. Its more scientific investigation under Mengarelli resulted in the enrichment of the Villa Giulia Museum, and then in the accumu- lation of cases full of grave accessories. The his- toric site however has not ceased to engage the attention of both the local population and the Soprintendenza alle Antichita for Southern Etruria; and the recent years culminated in the ceremony of March 12, 1967, when the Museo Nazionale Cerite was inaugurated in the spacious Castello munificently donated to the state by the noble owners, the Famiglia Ruspoli. The name of PIAZZA ARMERINA achieved wide fame a few years ago8 through the discovery of its Late Classical villa with figured mosaic pave- ments: the relevant literature is already consider- able. At present, a systematic survey of the whole surrounding countryside is being conducted by Professor Musinano. This has already led to the identification, in the zone "Montagna di Marzo,"' of an early Greek city; the circuit of walls and the street plan have been traced, together with numerous burial grounds in the surrounding ter- ritory. Some tombs had been despoiled by illicit searchers, but one has now been discovered intact, hewn out of the native rock, and containing two sarcophagi with over 250 objects which accompany two complete sets of bronze armor. The various types of ceramics and personal adornment belong to the archaic Corinthian period. This instructive material has been taken for safekeeping and study to the Syracuse Museum, but in due course should enter the museum planned for Piazza Armerina itself. From GELA, Professor Piero Orlandini continues his helpfulness of previous years. In 1965-1966 there was a lull in the excavations at Gela and in its interior, especially as it was necessary to sys- tematize and inventory the material obtained in the huge campaigns of excavation of 1964. At Gela itself there has been only the finding of a dump of molds for Hellenistic female statuettes and the discovery of some tombs of the fifth century B.c. with equipment of rf. Attic lekythoi. At SABUCINA, the site of previous investigations,"0 a third campaign was limited to exploration of the burial areas. Eighty-nine burials have been ex- cavated, with equipment of bf. Attic vases, some bronze vessels, and a plastic vase (pl. III, figs. 1-2). The discoveries confirm that this community en- joyed its greatest prosperity between the middle of the sixth and the middle of the fifth century B.C., until it was violently destroyed, doubtless at the hands of Ducetius, during the Siculan revolt. Meanwhile, the years 1965-1966 witnessed consid- erable additions to the list of Professor Orlandini's publications." The Soprintendente for WESTERN SICILY, Pro- fessor Vincenzo Tusa, sends the following informa- tion from his office in Palermo. During 1966 the activity of the Soprintendenza was devoted by preference to the discovery of the non-Greek re- mains, and in particular to those left in the ex- treme western projection of the island by the Punic peoples. At MOTYA excavation has continued, in collabora- tion with the Istituto del Vicino Oriente of the University of Rome, at two points on the islet in the LAGOON OF STAGNONE. At the Cappiddazzu (pl. I12, figs. 3-5) the investigators have determined the succession of the walls connected with this sacred complex of a Phoenician type with triple cella, the earliest parts of which appear to hark back to the seventh and sixth centuries B.c., while later accretions come down to the Arab period. In the tophet the stratographic examination has been car- 8 We do not repeat the considerable literature on this site. 9 II Tempo, Dec. 9, 1966. 1OAJA 67 (1963) 408. 11 "Arte indigena e colonizzazione greca in Sicilia," Koka- los Io-II, pp. 539ff.

III, fig. 6), leading to the dis- covery of numerous other pottery wares and votive stelae with chiefly anthropomorphic representa- tions, to be added to those found in the campaigns of 1964-1965. At SELINUNTE there has been continued excava- tion of the immense burial areas of the city, which have yielded an extremely rich series of vases- Corinthian and imitation, both black- and red- figured Attic, and Italiote (pl. III, fig. 7), figured terracottas, pointed amphorae of a Punic type, etc. At MARSALA, ancient LILYBAEUM, which after the destruction of Motya by Dionysius I of Syracuse in 398 B.c. assumed the headship of the Punic colonies of Sicily, the excavations have been concentrated in the zone of Capo Boeo, which had been ex- plored only sporadically and with gaps. Discoveries include some wall structures (pl. Il2, figs. 8-9) con- nected with the famous Carthaginian fortifications that withstood the assaults of Pyrrhus and of the Romans, and which present in some stretches the typical Punic structure a telaio (like a weaver's loom). The loose finds, consisting for the most part of pointed amphorae of a Punic-Hellenistic type and of Campanian wares, permit the dating of the remains of walls in the second half of the fourth and the first half of the third century B.C. In conclusion, at HIMERA, the Istituto di Arche- ologia of the University of Palermo, after three campaigns concentrated on the eastern elevation oc- cupied by the ancient inhabited area, made some soundings in 1966 in the sanctuary on the plain, the so-called Temple of the Victory, erected after the victory over the Carthaginians of 480 B.c. and uncovered by P. Marconi in 1929-1930. ROME POSTSCRIPT. April 28, 1967: since the prepara- tion of the above pages the 21st of April, 1967, has come and gone-the Parilia, the Birthday of Rome. It is not for mortal man, no longer pre- sumptuous in a changing world, to make use of the formula of the ancient provincials, ROMA AETERNA, and repeated discoveries in the subsoil have en- tailed a reinterpretation of the traditional abbrevia- tion A.U.C. But it was still proper that the anniversary should be solemnly observed upon the Capitol by the constituted authorities, and it was also well that the day should suggest serious contemplation in wider circles of the position of Rome in the broad setting of history and the responsibilities resting on present and future inheritors of her culture-and they extend far beyond the circle of the Seven Hills.</page><page sequence="5">VAN BUREN PLATE III Fig. I.
