<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROLE OF MAGIC JAMES THOMSON SHOTWELL Columbia University Recent discoveries indicate the existence of man, at least of some animal given to chipping stones, for hundreds of thousands of years upon this earth. This almost infinite extension of the course of human events into the so-called prehistoric ages makes the recorded past so insignificant a fraction of the whole, that it must not be wondered at if now and again a historian slips his leash and wanders out into the open fields of anthropological sociology, where time and space are at his free disposal, and all the phenomena of life from anthropoidal apes to the latest prodigy in one of our colleges find a den or a home. Such ex- cursions are not without a certain danger for the mere student of history, but the spirit of adventure is not entirely dead, even among those whose lives are spent in the ascetic disciplines of that monkish subject. It is frankly in the spirit of adventure that I make bold tonight to take up before you what I suppose is the largest sub- ject in human history-magic. It was the science and religion combined, much of the art, and most of the mode of thinking of our race for those vast stretches of centuries that we so lightly term the prehistoric. It is still the most important basis of actionl and of belief for millions of human beings, and has, as I hope to show, penetrated European history in such vital ways as to modify the structure of both church and state, dominate a large part of the philosophy, and affect the progress of science. Clothed in other forms it has enshrined itself in the most sacred associa- tion of many a person here present. It is incredible that so vital a subject should have so long escaped satisfactory treatment. But the incredible is true. For there is not an exhaustive description or analysis of magic- 78I</page><page sequence="2">782 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY simply as magic-in existence. It fills many treatises on other things; its dark seams run across the pages of practically every work on comparative religion; investigations on early law touch on its domain; primitive institutions are seen to have in it many of their roots; and it is from these outside angles that we get our impressions of its mysterious role. But apart from a single essay, which claims to be only a sketch, and to which we refer below, there is no satisfactory treatment of magic as magic and not as an adjunct to something else. There are no encyclopedias of magic science. It is as if it had effectively protected itself from the modern investigator by the power of its own taboos. I believe that in Paris, where such taboos are most likely first to meet their revolutionary tribunal, such an exhaustive treat- ment has been projected; but until it appears we are without any satisfactory analysis, and therefore all the more without any satisfactory synthesis which will explain the phenomena and the r6le of magic. Meanwhile, however, we are supplied with some provisional treatments, which we may regard as working hy- potheses, and it is to these, not as final results, but as possible interpretations, that I wish to direct your attention tonight. Let us take first that great compilation from which most English readers derive their ideas of comparative religion, The Golden Bough by J. G. Frazer. According to Frazer,* magic is the opposite of religion. It is a rude and mistaken science, in which man began his struggle with the mysterious forces of the world. By spell and by charm he met those dangerous powers whose presence he saw revealed in the multifold crises of his life: in sickness and death, in the chances of the hunt or the perils of war, in birth, in sexual relations, in the terror of spilt blood, in the gloom of the night, in the march of the storm, in all the terrible and the wonderful in his miracle-wrought uni- verse. Such as he was, Frazer thinks, this brute man of the eoliths, whether of the prehistoric past or of Australia today, turned his dawning consciousness upon the problem of a direct struggle with the elements. No god was invoked in that chatter- * In the second edition of the Golden Bough, accepting the distinction drawn by F. B. Jevons in his Introduction to the History of Religion.</page><page sequence="3">THE ROLE OF MAGIC 783 ing tongue which conjured up the storm in the dry season or health in sickness. It was man against nature, says Frazer, and religion has no part in such a duel. In the tragedy of his failure, religion was born. He turned from his futile arts to supplicate the powers he could not master. Religion, according to Frazer, comes in a second stage of human evolution. In eloquent words he sums up his view of such a process. We may illustrate the course which thought has hitherto run by liken- ing it to a web woven of three different threads-the black thread of magic, the red thread of religion, and the white thread of science..... Could we then survey the web of thought from the beginning, we should probably perceive it to be at first a chequer of black and white, a patch- work of true and false notions, hardly tinged as yet by the red thread of religion. But carry your eye farther along the fabric and you will remark that, while the black-and-white chequer still runs through it, there rests on the middle portion of the web, where religion has entered most deeply into its texture, a dark crimson stain, which shades off insensibly into a lighter tint as the white thread of science is woven more and more into the tissue.' Frazer thus claims that there is a "fundamental distinction and even opposition of principle between magic and religion."2 The one is a primitive "science," by which the powers of nature are compelled to work at the behest of man; the other is the attempt to placate and win over powers that may listen-or may not. It is defined as the "propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which are believed to direct and control the course of nature and of human life."3 Unfortunately when we test this scheme and the definitions which it involves, the data do not support the hypothesis, or at least lead us into serious difficulties in their adjustment. It is extremely doubtful if there is or ever was a tribe of savages absolutely given up to the black arts, and never quailing before the unpropitious into acts or at least emotions of "religion." Indeed the first motive for magic acts seems to have been a psy- 'The Golden Bough, III, 46I. 2Ibid., I., xvi. 3 Ibid., I, 63. In the pages which follow, Frazer makes the best of a bad case by treating much of religious practice as survivals of magic.</page><page sequence="4">784 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY chological reaction which is the parent of the whole group of emotions which we vaguely class as religious. There is little warrant, as Frazer's critics have pointed out, for assuming that the blank awe or cringing fear of that stonechipping animal who was destined to be a man was brayely mastered by any thought- ful and judicious use of a primitive science. The conjurer's arts did not come from any involved processes of thought, any insistent reasoning of cause and effect, even of the mistaken lines which Frazer analyzes. They bear on the face of them the con- vulsive response to nervous stimuli, and their efficacy generally has some relation to the fearful or disgusting character of the rites. The basal emotions of religion, even in the narrow sense of Frazer's definition, are already there. As for the invoking of spirits, turning to higher powers for aid, it is clear that this affords no sure dividing-line between magic and another thing called religion; for magic may use spirits or may not, without being any the more or less magic. The attempt to exclude magic from religion also leads one into strange straits at the other end of our evolution. For Frazer actually defines religion so narrowly as to exclude that highest religious thought, that mysticism where belief has grown into confidence, and that theism which reverently but calmly faces omnipotence. The conciliation of higher powers by sacrifice and prayer represents only a part of religion. One cannot separate religion from magic by a mere definition. The further we examine the phenomena of religions the more we find them interpenetrated with strains of magic forces, and where our comparatively keen analysis fails to detect those elu- sive penetrations of varying grades of intensity and power, the primitive mind certainly never was able to distinguish them. The Romans had their college of augurers as well as their sacri- ficing priests ;4 the augurers by their arts of divination made sure what sacrifice would be acceptable or adequate, and then the sacrificing priests fulfilled their demands. The joint operation, ' In fact three of the priestly colleges were concerned with divination. The XVviri sacris faciundis, the Augures, the Haruspices; while the magistrates took part in those that concerned the state.</page><page sequence="5">THE ROLE OF MAGIC 785 although it involved "religious" action in the sacrifice, was an improved form of that compelling of "the gods" which in primitive culture we term magic.5 In savage life, the medicine man would himself have performed the ceremonies he judged to be necessary. But the Roman believed with the Australian bush- man that a way existed by which the unseen powers could be made to be propitious. If they were not propitious the fault was because the ceremonies had been wrong or incomplete. Some ceremony existed which would bring the desired effect. The oracles of Greece disclosed this proper way to approach the gods, the prophets of Israel marked out as well the method by which Jahwe could be placated and victory be assured over the gentiles who "knew not Jahwe." Even to propitiate a god by upright conduct is but the socialized counterpart of the muttering of charms; for in the last analysis the muttering of charms lies also within the sphere of conduct. The spell-worker sets about the accomplishment of his task with hardly more direct purpose than those Christians who keep the commandments or attend church on Sunday in order to obtain divine favor. Their theology itself exhorts them not to doubt in the efficacy of such good works. It is claiming little for religion to exclude from it those actions which are based upon the certainty that its promises will be fulfilled. Religious action is intelligible only upon the assump- tion that it will accomplish something. Whether it will accomp- lish all that is desired or not the basis for the action remains substantially the same. It is only when religion, fertilized by thought, brings forth theologies that Frazer's contrast has a meaning. But then magic is to be contrasted with theology, the questioner, the hypothesis-builder, rather than with religion, the mysterious seat of emotional responses. The black and red threads in the fabric of thought are of the same wool; the color changes in the growing light of thought. Unless a large part of the history of Christianity, lies outside the realm of religion, we must seek for a wider definition. And 'The Latin word religio perfectly expresses these ideas. The naive affronte,ry of the Roman attitude toward their gods is as a matter of fact a verv direct indication of the pure magic underlying their cult.</page><page sequence="6">786 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY it must face two ways-inward to the springs of the emotions, outward to the means by which it shows itself before the world. It is, therefore, on the one hand the state of feeling awakened in a man by the consciousness in and around him of mysterious powers, and on the other, those manifestations in words, deeds, customs, and institutions which testify to his belief in these powers, and serve to bring him into relation to them.6 Under the wide arch of this definition, all the phenomena of religion find a place, and we shall not have to cross and recross a sacred threshold as we turn from sacrifice to purification, which would be the case if we attempted to frame our definition so as to shut out magic from religion. We therefore place magic within the sphere of religion-by means of a definition! But a definition never, solves our diffi- culties; it is at best but our working hypothesis; and the question now is: Does it work? So with our tables cleared we return to our magic. But we return to it, not as a thing by itself, a science " This definition is based upon two, neither of which seems to me wholly satisfactory: that of L. Marillier in his admirable article on "Religion" in La Grande Encyclopedie, and that of C. P. Tiele in Elements of the Science of Re- ligion (I, 4). Marillier says: "Religion is the sum of three things: (i) the state of feeling awakened in a man by the obscure consciousness in and around him of powers, superior and analogous to himself, with whom he can enter into relation; (2) the representations engendered by these sentiments and which furnish them definite objects; and (3) the ritual acts called forth by the combined action of these emotions and beliefs." "Tiele's definition is as follows: "By religion I mean those manifestations of the human mind in words, deeds, customs, and institutions which testify to man's belief in the superhuman, and serve to bring him into relation with it." The difference between either of these and the composite definition above is obvious. The one point at which immediate exception may be taken in Tiele's definition is its attitude toward religious beliefs, whether myths or theologies. These do, as Marillier insists, play a great and essential r6le in religion and should receive clear recognition. But "the consciousness of mysterious powers" however acutely it may be developed, is rather to be viewed as a religious stimulus than as religion itself. The con- templation of the beatitudes of heaven or of the sufferings of Christ lifts or stirs the emotions like those desert silences that find a lyric voice in St. Jerome or the sound of music or any other powerful impulse. Nor are the powers "analogous to himself" as Marillier states, until animism is reached, when the growing consciousness of individuality throws its changing reflex upon the screen of environing reality.</page><page sequence="7">THE ROLE OF MAGIC 787 of compelling the powers of nature, but as a part of that complex process we call "religion." What is magic? Most of us have no very keen appreciation of the occult arts of our ancestors; and even where we can recall the figures of those simple beings who still feel the terror of the evil eye, our impressions are dim and confused. Such confused impressions, in fact, correspond with the phenomena; for that black web of Frazer's rhetoric was woven by no logically con- structed mechanism, ruled by intelligence and controlled by will; it is in reality nothing but stray strands knotted by convulsive movements-stray strands that oftenest break in the dawn of reason and are lost, but here and there pass on into our moral restraints and political institutions, sexual or religious or social taboos. We are all familiar with Frazer's classification of these phenomena. He has summed it up in his Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship as follows: Tlhe principles of thought upon which magic is based appear to resolve themselves into two: first that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact continue to act on each other even after the contact has been severed. The former principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion. From the first of these principles-namely, the Law of Similarity-the magician infers that he can produce any effect he desires me, ely by imitating it: from the second-namely, the Law of Contact or Contagion-he concludes that whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not. Charms based on the Law of Similarity may be called Homeopathic or Imitative Magic, Charms based on the Law of Contact or Contagion may be called Contagious Magic.' A common example of homeopathic magic is the burning or spearing of the effigy or likeness of an enemy; a simpler one would be the use of yellow turnips to cure jaundice. The pages of anthropological reports are crowded with this sort of mis- application of analogy. Contagious magic is more subtle. The lover who fastens a lock of his hair to the object of his affections, TOp. Cit., p. 37.</page><page sequence="8">788 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY or the prophet whose miraculous power was transferred in his mantle were both dealing in contagious magic. Further examples would be out of place here. This simple scheme of Frazer serves fairly well as a pro- visional basis of classification of the phenomena of magic. A vast mass of magic processes is covered by it, and the rest can be adjusted to it. But it is obviously not an explanation of magic at all, but merely a description of how magic works. It is almost as far from being an explanation of magic as a history of lit- urgies would be from a description of Christianity. As a matter of fact, one of these lines of action, the one Frazer has most in mind when he defines magic as a science-that homeopathic doctrine that like cures like-leads nowhere, while the other- the idea of contagion-opens up the whole field for further analysis. Contagion implies that there is something to be trans- mitted. In that something, (which Frazer still ignores), we may find, as Sidney Hartland puts it, the idee m?ere not only of magic but of religion as well.8 The study of this contagion has been most thoroughly taken up in connection with the investigation of sexual taboos. One of the first general surveys of such phenomena was Ernest Crawley's article in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute for I895 on "Sexual Relations." Later Crawley elaborated his theories in a curious and somewhat uncritical medley, which nevertheless still remains the best single guide to the sources for the phenomena of contagion, The Mystic Rose. Other studies, including Ploss's Das Weib in der Natur utnd Vlikerkunde sup- plied numerous instances of the danger with which primitive man invested women, particularly in the crises of life. In I896 a sug- gestive contribution was made by E. Durkheim in the first num- ber of the Annee sociologique, where he carried back the idea of contagion underlying sexual taboos to a principle of primitive repulsion such as is seen in the attitude of men toward spilt blood. A preoccupation about totems prevented him seeing where he had got. (There was a time when one could not see the woods 8Cf. Folklore, 1904, p. 359.</page><page sequence="9">THE ROLE OF MAGIC 789 for the totem poles.) That primitive repulsion at the sight of blood, or of a corpse, is a thing so primitive that we share it with certain of the lower animals. Such things, somehow, cause a recoil which is as near instinct as we can come. It is but natural that the savage should feel this most intensely, with his perceptions sharpened and his reasoning still undeveloped. So he is surrounded on every side by countless such dangers. Cer- tain things are electric with mysterious power. They cause fear, awe, or wonder. There is both danger and blessing in the blood that is the symbol of life as well as the sign of death. It is the same with all "sacred" things; they may curse or bless. They merely discharge some power, some radiation in the psychic universe, and the man who comes in contact, whose nerves receive its shock, is its victim or beneficiary. Such motor forces are the basis of "contagious magic." The horrible and the wonderful, whatever shocks the primitive nerves, will set such forces going. How many of us inquire what is meant by "impurity" in a corpse? Or what is "virtue" in a saint? What emanations from a rock-crystal makes it efficacious in the hands of an Arunta medicine man? Most of all, in what does the "divinity" of Frazer's divine man consist? It is remarkable that although most of the phenomena cited in The Golden Bough are saturated with this uncanny essence, this mysterious, dangerous something which marks them off from the plain things of life, the author never felt its spell. For twenty years he has turned aside and left these questions unanswered, concentrating his attention upon the homeopathic processes by which the forces are handled. It is to be admitted that a study of the processes is worth while. For those occult forces have infinite possibilities for weal as well as for woe; like electricity they can not only be insulated, but be set to work for one's advantage. Already we see ahead of us the demand for medicine men-and theological seminaries-to direct its course. It now transpires that savages the world over have gone farther in their analysis of their own actions than the Cambridge anthropologist. For even in about as primitive a state of culture as has yet been found, there is not only distinct recognition of</page><page sequence="10">790 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY this mysterious power behind contagion, but the savages have gone so far as to give it a name. It is orenda among the Hurons. Spirits, men, and beasts may have or be orenda-for it is both adjective and noun. The successful hunter owes to it his game; the storms have it; it is in the voice of the enchanter, incantations are filled with it; it is the power of the medicine man. Its very vagueness aids in its definition, for it is not spirit, it is merely power-mysterious, wonderful, uncanny potency. The Algon- quin manitou is the same thing; and both the idea and the name are found generally among our Indians. The work of Miss Fletcher, Messrs. McGee, Hewitt, and Jones, as well as that of Powell, Brinton, and others has at last brought this home to us. The Aruntas of Australia call it arungquiltha, the Malgaches of Madagascar call it hasina, the Maoris atua, the Melanesians mana, and, I venture to add, the Latins, that one people of antiquity whose state religion remained even in the time of its highest culture a clear perpetuation of magic, called it scacer, or the sacred-the thing with power to bless or curse, the nameless, formless force which even in historic times took to itself form and shape as god or goddess, Bona Dea or Optimus Maximus. Time will not permit me to trace in detail the succession of modern investigators which has brought this principle of religious evolution to our attention. Although early dictionaries, espec- ially of Indian languages, contained 'some hint of the idea, and investigators here or there brought in scattered evidences from time to time, it was not until about 1895, SO far as I know, that the mass of evidence became general, and, mainly through our own American workers, drew attention to the implications. Yet the significance was not really seen until about I900, when Mr. Marett brought out in Folk Lore his theory of a "preanimistic religion," to be followed the next year by Mr. E. S. Hartland.9 The first clear statement, however, of the role of orenda, or mana, in magic was the article "Esquisse d'une theorie generale de la magie," by Messrs. Hubert and Mauss in the Annee soci- oloaie for i02-i. This masterful essay remains todav the best 'Folklore, XII, 20.</page><page sequence="11">THE ROLE OF MAGIC 79I analysis of magic we have. Meanwhile over here an article by Professor Arthur 0. Lovejoy in the sixteenth volume of the Monist presented the theory in concise and clear terms, while in Germany Professor D. N. Soderblom, K. T. Preuss and others worked on the problem of this Lebenselektrizitat. We have no time here to take up the question as to whether this mana is behind all magic practices, or merely underlies those of contagion. This seems to me the most important point of attack for analytic criticism. But whether there are homeopathic processes in which mana is not in evidence or not, one thing is sure, this is the path which leads us onward in -the evolution of religion. For mana does not die out when animism appears, nor when animism grows into anthropomorphism, nor even when polytheism passes away before monotheism. Its maleficent ele- ments grows less and less apparent, and its beneficence more, until, as divine grace, it nourishes the faith and strengthens the moral purpose of the Christian world. In the sacraments of the church it still works by the old laws of sympathetic magic. In the realm of faith it has at last left the material media of its long prehistoric phase. It is now evident why we must readjust our definitions of religion. Evolution from simple beginnings holds in this realm as elsewhere. Religion was no special creation midway along the centuries of human groping; it was but the intenser action of that mystic power which lay at the heart of magic. The action changes with changing society. At first the brute recoil from things of terror, the sense of wonder at their awful power, the thrill that came to the confused senses from any imagined cause, this psychic reaction adjusts itself, reaches out to further and undreamed of possibilities as the reflex of the widening experi- ence of man, until at last it compasses the whole range of religious emotion. Made a blessing instead of a curse by those first specialists in psychology, the medicine men, and surround- ing society with taboos which are the basis of most early juris- prudence, the results of our ancestors' fears and awe-struck wonderings, are to be seen on every side in our institutions and civilization today.</page><page sequence="12">792 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY In closing let me revert to the one example to which I have devoted myself especially, the sacraments of the Christian church. Tertullian's explanation of baptism would have been understood by an Australian bushman: "Water, when God wills, attains the sacramental power of sanctification." That is, water can acquire mana and is capable of conveying it to the one who is touched by it. Its holiness is contagious. The old Greek phrase used by Ignatius concerning the Eucharist, "the medicine of immortality," would have been partly understood at least by the Huron or Malay. Without some such medicine there would have been no medicine men. Obviously one needs the historical point of view and the scientific outlook to see these things. Therefore it is not to be wondered at that the early Christians, those most unhistor- ical and unscientific people, were long unable to define their own sacraments adequately. Augustine gets nearest a definition when he calls them the "outward and visible sign of an inward and in- visible grace" but the world had to wait for more than a thousand years of Christianity before Hugh of St. Victor added the clause which really described the operation "and are capable of convey- ing the grace of which they are the sign." In short, Augustine points out the importance of the mana and Hugh the law of homeopathy by which it works. So the electric forces still fol- low their earliest laws. Sacramental Christianity still invests the material world with mysterious forces. But while the con- ception of sacramental grace in the mind of Augustine or the analysis of Thomas Aquinas is of a kind with those of medicine men the world over, it is no longer repellent but august; for the mctana becomes nothing less than divinity itself; the barriers of this material world, which, according to Christian faith, shut in the free life of the soul, become by a beneficent paradox the very avenues by which it reaches the divine. One can see dimly now how much of the history of mankind in general and of Europe in particular, of social taboos and state jurisprudence, of marriage and inheritance, of power of priests and kings, rests directly for an explanation upon magic. The sacred and the holy are merely our equivalents for mana and arungquiltha. Moreover if our surmises are correct, we have at</page><page sequence="13">THE ROLE OF MAGIC 793 last a consistent theory for the main line of religious evolution; and we reach the strange conclusion that the sacraments, as insti- tutions which still definitely embody the earliest impulses toward religion, are older than God himself-older, at least in that comparatively modern thing in this old universe, that reflex of actuality which we call the human consciousness.</page></plain_text>
