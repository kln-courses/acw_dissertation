<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tribal literature: ?ndividual 7dentity and the Collective 'Unconscious THOMAS E. SANDERS (Prince Nippawanock) IN SPITE OF the frequently articulated and almost realized cultural and physical genocidal intent of the Transplant American in the western hemisphere, the Native American has survived. His reli- gion, literature and identity have been damaged, but they still exist. The trans- plant's tortured concept of manifest des- tiny, however, has brought him to his present state of alienation from nature, from other men, and even from himself in the United States. And that alienation has caused him to reassess the remnants of the literature indigenous to this conti- nent but almost lost as a result of his need to minimize the complex philoso- phies of the Native American he deemed savage in order to justify his own bar- barous aggressions. The Transplant American's contradic- tory attitudes about commitments and treaties in Viet Nam, Panama and Wounded Knee in the first three months of 1973 indicate the extent of his con- fusion and ambivalence-an ambivalence engendered by an Hellenic concept of personal identity on the one hand, an Hebraic concept of group identity on the other. That capacity for ambivalence and hypocrisy is not new; it manifested itself as early as 1562 when the Spanish priests under Bishop Diego de Landa burned the great Mayan libraries to erase the recorded "superstition and lies of the devil" seen in the books by the bishop of the Prince of Peace. De Landa's tragic decision cost future generations all knowledge of the centuries-old mathe- matical computations that had allowed the Maya to measure the solar year at 365.2420 days (our most recent measure reveals it to be 365.2422) and to track the course of the planet Venus as ac- curately as today's scientists can with laser beams and giant telescopes. Unfor- tunately, the superstitious priest could not have acted otherwise: his Hebraic religion dictated his conduct, even as his Hellenic heritage tardily asserted itself and caused him to spend the remainder of his days in Yucatan re-recording much of the information he had consigned to the flames. The most cursory summary of the de- velopment of the Judeo-Christian tradi- tion in conflict with the Hellenic heri- tage will indicate the irony of the Trans- plant American's attitudes toward the Native American and his remarkable lit- erature. The Transplant American's concept of God is a borrowing from an oriental peo- ple whose tribal religion placed the indi- vidual in a rigid framework of laws rea- listically conceived for small-group sur- vival. Nominal tribal membership was bounded by the Jew's ability to observe the law as a measure of individual ca- pacity to love his fellow tribesmen, for tribal raison d'etre was to serve God. Self-realization thereby became a matter of group conduct rather than personal innovation. Western man's political concept, on the other hand, sprang from a second tri- bal people whose sense of individuality 256</page><page sequence="2">TRIBAL LITERATURE and responsibility is summarized in the king's prologue speech in Oedipus Rex: "My spirit groans for the city, for myself, for you." Among the Greeks, nominal tribal membership was bounded by the ability to observe one's responsibility to the collective group (the city state), to oneself, and to others-in that order. As the city state was dedicated to serving the individual, the individual served him- self in serving the state. As he served himself well and nobly, he automatically served the group. If he brought dishonor to self, he dishonored the state and the group, for the group comprised the state. The tribal raison d'etre of the Greek, then, was to serve self that all might profit. Antithetically opposed, the two tribal concepts served the originating tribes well. When the emerging European at- tempted to combine them, confusion re- sulted. On the one hand, he saw himself the chosen of another people's God to whom he must dedicate his life in ser- vice; on the other, he aspired to the individuality of his Greek heritage, an individuality that dedicated his life to serving his own ends. Somehow, respon- sibility to the tribe or group did not sur- vive the wedding of disparate philoso- phies. And yet the tribal origins of the Brit- ish, the German, the French were not utterly lost. Vague unrests, dim memo- ries resided in the genes passed from generation to generation. Variously la- beled "racial memory" by Sigmund Freud, "the collective unconscious" by Carl Jung and "spiritus mundi" by Wil- liam Butler Yeats, a pervasive memory of old gods, old allegiances, old tribal rela- tionships created the possibility of an in- stilled nationalism when danger threat- ened the state. But because the identity residing in an epic combination of the religious and national origins of the peo- ple had been sundered by an imposed and alien religion, a sense of descent from the godhead was denied the new western man. Still, a sense of the sacred- ness of soil bequeathed by the old gods could survive in the realization that the humus underfoot was a mixture of land possessed and land owned because it was the gift of generations of ancestors whose corporeal forms had added physically to it. And that sense of sacredness could be manipulated into nationalism, though it could never again be recalled as a gift from God to the progenitors of the pres- ent. That covenant had been between dead gods and ancestors who had en- tered into a false bargain. The loss of original alliances led to intellectualization of that which should have been natural had tribal identity not been shattered. Ultimately, Alexander Pope proclaimed reason to be the tool of understanding the new self. In his "Essay on Man," he directed, "Say first, of God above, or Man below,/What can we reason, but from what we know?" Unfortunately, what the group "knew" had been deliberately dismissed with the adoption of another people's god. Pope attempted to redirect western man's con- scious effort to find his lost identity by saying men's error lay in "reasoning pride" that caused them to aspire to be gods. To what end? Happiness! Sun- dered from their original gods, alienated from their ancestral knowledge, they were unhappy. Only acceptance in the sight of the adopted god could create happiness; therefore, to be one with god was synonymous with happiness, "our being's end and aim." Further, Pope con- tended, to arrive at that state of happi- ness, men must first understand the di- chotomous things they had become: "Know then thyself, presume not God to scan,/The proper study of mankind is man." Pope had obviously studied man- kind, for he recognized the worst symp- toms of ambivalence: man's inability "his mind or body to prefer" because he is "in doubt to deem himself a god, or beast." 257</page><page sequence="3">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION Neither god nor beast. The oriental re- ligion taught the tribal European that he had a soul-and that soul set him apart from the other animals, the brutes which such diverse thinkers as John Locke and Charles Darwin agreed lack reason or the ability to abstract. Once the Euro- pean had accepted that reasoned defini- tion of himself, he could never again par- ticipate in the collective conscious that binds the tribal unit, making it one ele- ment in the perfect whole that results when all created things have natural function that distinguishes them or sets them outside the patterned whole only when they violate their equal but differ- ent importances by assuming preferen- tial treatment from a prime mover or first cause. Such assumption led to that fragmentation resulting from seeing the land as commodity rather than as sacred combination of god and ancestor with a natural regard for his survival. It led to a disregard for his brother creatures and the attendant loss of a sense of their mu- tually beneficial, harmonious coexistence. And, finally, it led to a loss of a sense of mutuality with other group members. If any element in a perfect whole can be violated, all elements ultimately depreci- ate as hubris, or ego elevates the individ- ual to a position of assumed preeminence. Ultimately such damage becomes too apparent to be ignored, and reason seeks ways to mend the broken whole. In 1947, John Collier, a former commissioner of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, wrote a lit- tle wistfully of the losses apparent in an American society dominated by a sense of self-importance, a sense of superiority that had alienated life from that society. He observed that loss of awareness cre- ates death, a death the American Indian had not suffered in spite of the incredi- ble efforts to extirpate him. Of the In- dian, Collier said, "They had what the world has lost, they have it now; what the world has lost, the world must have again lest it die. Not many years are left to have or have not, to recapture the lost ingredient-the ancient, lost reverence and passion for the earth and its web of life." But Collier was a Cassandra singing sadly in wind. Twenty-five years later, in April of 1972, however, the Hymn Society of America was spurred to action by some of the same realizations that had prompted Collier. That month, the Asso- ciated Press circulated a feature by George W. Cornell. Its headline: "Sing a Song in Praise of Mother Earth." Now that the churches have started stressing the urgency of taking care of Mother Earth, they want some songs to sing about it. The lyrics are needed as part of the religious efforts to "rebuild man's atti- tudes about protecting the environ- ment," says Anastasia Van Burkalow, of the Hymn Society of America. A ge- ology professor and organist, she adds: "We need to be reminded that the good gifts of the earth come to us from God the Creator, whom we should give thanks, and that we hold them in our possession not as outright owners but as stewards. We are responsible for their preservation and even for their enhancement because of the power he has given us to be co-creators with him." "While ecology is a relatively new em- phasis for the preacher and the con- gregation, for the teacher and the class, it is vital for the survival of mankind," the society says in starting its new hymn search. Fundamentally, it is a "religious prob- lem," the society adds, and appropri- ate hymns are needed that will speak to God and will also move men to action. The tribal American reading this arti- cle would have good reason to emit a stereotyped "Ugh" and wonder at the retardation of his Christian brother. Were he to concern himself with the Transplant's arguments about the inher- ent merit of group singing about Mother 258</page><page sequence="4">TRIBAL LITERATURE Earth, about the existence of the collec- tive unconscious or racial memory, and about the conscious and deliberate effort to manufacture a love of the soil of this continent, the Native American would probably find the whole thing the most humorous set of circumstances since the day Custer ordered, "We're taking no prisoners today-pass the word." The tribal member knows his religion recounts all he needs to know of his be- ginnings and answers all of the mysteri- ous questions he needs answered in this existence. He knows, further, that his songs are gifts from Wah'kon-tah and therefore expressive of the best senti- ments for the occasion because they are shared communication. He knows the language in which they are framed is sacred. And he knows the truths em- bodied in his lyrical sharings, his reli- gious chants, his political documents, his oratorical messages-those truths are the sentiments of the tribal past, the tribal present, and the tribal future. As such, they must be accurate to the last syllable, reverently but warmly offered, and re- hearsed for the young to learn, the old to remember. He knows a collective con- scious binds the tribe together into one cohesive unit in which the greatest honor of the greatest warrior accrues to every member of the tribe, the most ignoble act of the weakest member accrues to every member of the tribe as well. The Transplant American, free of any such group consciousness, deems such assertions nonsense-that kind of idealis- tic possibility a highly civilized, utopian dreams. It would be well for him to take his doubts to the Mohawk reservation at Akwesasne, New York, for the reading of the epic of Dekaniwedah and the Law of the Great Peace. On that soil, to his amazement he would find there is, indeed, an American epic which dates from the tenth Century A.D. In the most popular version, that of Seth Newhouse, it begins: North of the beautiful lake in the land of the Crooked Tongues, was a long winding bay and at a certain spot was the Huron town, Ka-ha-nah-yehn. Near by was the great hill, Ti-ro-nat-ha-ra- da-donh. In the village lived a good woman who had a virgin daughter. Now strangely this virgin conceived and her mother knew that she was about to bear a child. The daughter about this time went into a long sleep and dreamed that her child should be a son whom she should name Dekani- wedah. The messenger in the dream told her that he should become a great man and that he should go among the Flint people to live and that he should also go to the Many Hill Nation and there raise up the Great Tree of Peace. It was true as had been said that the virgin gave birth to a boy and the grandmother greatly disliked him and she rebuked her daughter. The epic traces the growth and wan- derings of the Peace Maker, his liaison with Hyanwatha the orator, and the eventual establishing of the Law of the Great Peace, a binding law that created the Iroquois League and guides its con- duct to this day. The oldest extant con- stitution of continuous duration in the world, the Great Law served as a model for the Constitution of the United States, although white historians prefer to avoid the information. However, it is a matter of record that Benjamin Franklin, mak- ing his proposals for a union of the Colo- nies at Albany in 1754, wrote: "It would be a strange thing if Six Nations of ignorant savages should be capable of forming a scheme for such an union, and be able to execute it in such a manner as that it has subsisted ages and appears indissoluble; and yet that a like union should be impracticable for ten or a dozen English colonies, to whom it is more necessary and must be more advan- tageous, and who cannot be supposed to want an equal understanding of their interests." 259</page><page sequence="5">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION That thousand-year old document be- gins with Dekaniwedah's pronounce- ment, "With the statesmen of the League of Five Nations, I plant the Tree of Great Peace. I plant it in your territory, Atotarho, and the Onondaga Nation: in the territory of you who are Firekeep- ers. Setting forth a completely democratic concept wherein each adult member of the tribe, nation, and league has voice, the law of the Great Peace reveals itself as the model of the Constitution of the United States when the two documents are textually compared. And such com- parison is startling indeed, for the sym- bols of pine tree and eagle clutching the bundled arrows of union represented the Iroquois long before the arrival of the white man who was to adopt them as the symbols of his government. Even more startling is the realization that, while men alone sat in the council fire, the women of the tribe alone chose the rep- resentative men and allowed them to serve only so long as they served honor- ably and well. If they deviated from honor in the eyes of the women, they were warned three times and removed if they failed to measure up to the stan- dards set by the women. The epics of other peoples, the laws of other peoples are, in the main, mu- seum pieces of literature and loop-hole riddled codes. We study them for their historical interest, we live by them grudgingly. And we say epics are the heritage of the past, long since set down out of the oral tradition, long since a dead tradition. But among the Native American Iro- quois, the epic not only survives, it is epically alive. Like all nations, the Iro- quois knows times of stress and division. When national unity needs reinforce- ment, when the people need to strength- en a flagging sense of national cohesion and identity, a special reading is called. If the nation is free of crisis for extended periods, the reading takes place every five years automatically. The people as- semble and, in a five-day ceremony, the epic is recited by an honored speaker, his version always slightly different from other versions because the epic is still a live form-perhaps the only live form of the epic in existence. At the conclusion of the recital, the law is read. It is a set, unchanging law, the reading being a recital from memory in the traditional fashion, the reader being monitored by two elders who correct any mispronun- ciation, incorrect word, or deviation from the authorized text. At the end of the reading, the people have relived their past and reminded themselves that it extends into and shapes their present. Orenda. has been made manifest-Oren- da, that spiritual power that summarizes the past of the people and makes them cohesive in the present-that force has created a sense of "happening now," a sense that works mystically and actually. It is, in short, the collective unconscious sensitized into the collective conscious. The force it generates among the people has the power to ward off evil, make good possible, and keep the nation strong. Such was always the purpose of the epic and the law among all peoples; but, among the Iroquois, it is a living tradition. An isolated incident that proves only that one league of tribes deliberately cul- tivate the collective conscious? Listen to a brief excerpt from Indian Boyhood, the autobiography of Ohiyesa, a Sioux, who knew no other people for the first fifteen years of his life but who later be- came Charles A. Eastman, M.D., gradu- ate of Harvard. It is commonly supposed that there is no systematic education of their children among the aborigines of this country. Nothing could be farther from the truth. All the customs of this prim- itive people were held to be divinely instituted, and those in connection 260</page><page sequence="6">TRIBAL LITERATURE with the training of children were scru- pulously adhered to and transmitted from one generation to another. The expectant parents conjointly bent all their efforts to the task of giv- ing the new-comer the best they could gather from a long line of ancestors. A pregnant Indian woman would often choose one of the greatest characters of her family and tribe as a model for her child. This hero was daily called to mind. She would gather from tradi- tion all of his noted deeds and daring exploits, rehearsing them to herself when alone. In order that the impres- sion might be more distinct, she avoided company. She isolated herself as much as possible, and wandered in solitude, not thoughtlessly, but with an eye to the impress given by grand and beautiful scenery. Scarcely was the embryo warrior ush- ered into the world, when he was met by lullabies that speak of wonderful exploits in hunting and war. Those ideas which so fully occupied his moth- er's mind before his birth are now put into words by all about the child, who is as yet quite unresponsive to their appeals to his honor and ambition. He is called the future defender of his people, whose lives may depend upon his courage and skill. If the child is a girl, she is at once addressed as the future mother of a noble race. Ohiyesa notes the animistic inability of the Native American to consider man a superior being. "The animals are re- garded as his friends, and spoken of al- most as tribes of people, or as his cousins, grandfathers and grandmothers." Evolu- tionists may make of that statement what they will; the attitude pervades all Na- tive American literature. Further, "Very early, the Indian boy assumed the task of preserving and transmitting the legends of his ancestors and his race." In the oral tradition, everyone knows the litera- ture and history of his people. And he knows the religious beliefs, for, as Ohi- yesa concludes, "We were taught gene- rosity to the poor and reverence for the 'Great Mystery.' Religion was the basis of all Indian training." Ohiyesa's reference to the Great Mys- tery may be confusing to the holder of the popular belief that the Native Ameri- can was a polytheistic pagan with thoughts of the great spirit and the hap- py hunting ground-both concepts being figments of the white man's imagination. And, for that reason it might be well to reflect briefly on the nature of Judeo- Christianity and its concept of god. Most Christians blithely assert their religion is monotheistic, most other reli- gions, polytheistic. Asked to define mono- theism, they respond immediately, "Hav- ing one god." Asked what Satan and Mi- chael and Gabriel are, they are some- what at a loss, for those minor divinities are obviously immortal, Elohim, himself, lacking the power to destroy them. Ju- deo-Christianity has more than one god. But it is, nevertheless, monotheistic. By definition, monotheism is the belief that only one "first cause" or "prime mover" existed without being created, that the first cause brought all other things into existence. Elohim existed. He created Satan and the other angels, man, other animals, etc. The divine nature of Satan et al. does not make Judeo-Christianity any less monotheistic. Polytheism, on the other hand, holds no "first cause" or "prime mover" responsible for the lesser gods. The Greeks, for instance, were polytheistic because their gods simply came into existence through a process of interrelationships, the major pantheon being the offspring of earlier gods. The Native American religions en- countered by the white man were every bit as monotheistic as Judeo-Christianity and, actually, far more subtle, more com- plex, in that Manitou (or Wah'kon-tah or Sakoiatison, depending on the language) is incapable of being anthropomorphised as is Elohim, who created man in his own image. Being all things simultaneously, 261</page><page sequence="7">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION the Great Holy Mystery lacks image, cannot be depicted in a painting or stat- uary. The Europeans' lack of capacity to abstract to that degree, however, caused them to assume the Native American was polytheistic, his religious tenets "bar- baric" and "uncivilized." Nothing can now be done about the colonists' stupidi- ty, but we can compare the exquisite subtleties of the Gospel according to Saint John with the greater subtleties of the creation accounts of the Uitoto of Columbia and the Zufii of the American Southwest. St. John states: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God: All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made." In the first-century A. D. Koine Greek of St. John, Logos is the Word, and it means the "expressible thought, the articulation of idea." In short, Saint John asserts that the creative process of articulated thought and the godhead existed simul- taneously, neither one preceding the other. However, two creation accounts exist in the more primitive Genesis. There, Elohim argues for the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden lest they eat of the tree of life and "become im- mortal even as we." The first person plu- ral pronoun suggests God was not a cosmic creator at all, merely a deity limited to terrestial creation as the lesser gods or trickster figures are in Native American religions. The Uitoto of Columbia are more theologically complex and subtle in their understanding of the creation process. Their account unequivocally establishes the Great Holy Mystery as a first cause: In the beginning, the word gave origin to the Father. A phantasm, nothing else existed in the beginning: The Father touched an illusion, he grasped some- thing mysterious. Nothing existed. Through the agency of a dream our father Naimuena (meaning 'he who is or has a phantasm') kept the mirage to his body, and he pondered long and thought deeply. Nothing existed, not even a stick to support the vision: our Father attached the illusion to the thread of a dream and kept it by the aid of his breath. He sounded to reach the bottom of the appearance, but there was nothing. Nothing existed in- deed. Then the Father again investi- gated the bottom of the mystery. He tied the empty illusion to the dream thread and pressed the magical sub- stance upon it. Thus by the aid of his dream he held it like a wisp of raw cotton. Then he sized the mirage bot- tom and stamped upon it repeatedly, sitting down at last on his dreamed earth. The earth-phantasm was now his, and he spat out saliva repeatedly so that the forests might grow. Then he lay down upon his earth and cov- ered it with the roof of heaven. As he was the owner of the earth he placed above it the blue and the white sky. Thereupon, Rafuema, 'the man who has the narratives,' sitting at the base of the heavens, pondered, and he created this story so that we might listen to it here upon earth. The Zufii conceived the word as the first creation, unthought but possible, of Awonawilona (meaning the 'Maker and Container of All,' therefore, again, un- equivocally a first cause.) Said the Zufii: Before the beginning of the new-mak- ing, Awonawilona solely had being. There was nothing else whatsoever throughout the great space of the ages save everywhere black darkness in it, and everywhere void desolation. In the beginning of the new-made, Awona- wilona conceived within himself and thought outward in space, whereby mists of increase, streams potent of growth, were evolved and uplifted. Here the first cause exists independently of the word, but before anything can be created the word must be conceived within Awonawilona. 262</page><page sequence="8">TRIBAL LITERATURE Whether it existed before Manitou, simultaneously, or shortly thereafter, the word is vital to the Great Holy Mystery, being, perhaps, the greatest mystery, for it contains the power to lure game into range, to cause plants to grow and rain to fall, to make medicine work, to allow man to address, be heard by, and join with the Great Holy Mystery. As such, language itself is sacred, not to be pro- faned by cavalier and casual usage or misused for the utterance of false state- ments or spiritual obscenities. Because it is the repository of the collective con- scious, it creates a oneness with the Great Holy Mystery, and that oneness is tribal consciousness. It would have been strange had the pedestrian colonists un- derstood the concept, for it defies the human limitation of reason. However, the Native American does not anguish over his incapacity to understand the infinite. As the Osage explain, "That which the children of the earth do not comprehend as they travel the roads of the earth and which becomes clear to them only when they have passed on to the Great Mysteries is Wah'kon-tah." The collective conscious and the magic properties of the word are nowhere more in evidence than in the poetry of the Native American. Seldom of any great length, most poems are of an intensely personal nature, either lullabies, love songs, or communications between the individual and Manitou. But remember: Manitou is not some anthropomorphic deity. Manitou is the Great Holy Mys- tery, the Maker and Container of All, the totality in which everything exists so all things, in sum, are Manitou. And because Manitou is the Container of All, the Great Holy Mystery is the collective conscious. And the components of that collective conscious are the things of the earth-the quick and the dead, the seen and the unseen, matter and spirit. The essence of that completeness lies at the heart of this Crow war song: Whenever there is any trouble, I shall not die but get through. Though arrows are many, I shall arrive. My heart is manly. No vainglorious boast, no statement of braggadocio, the poem-song-dance (for it is all three simultaneously) is an in- cantory prayer. The statement is couched in the magic word; the rhythmical ascen- sion of that word to the Great Holy Mystery makes it so. The poet-singer does not assert he is equipped for sur- vival nor that he is uncowardly; he lifts the incantation to Wah'kon-tah and the incantation creates the reality. As his word is himself articulated, he must see to the reality himself, however, for one does not rely on the Great Holy Mystery, one performs as an integral part of Mani- tou. Perhaps Jean Paul Sartre was at- tempting to achieve some sort of state- ment like this belief when, in his great apologia for existentialism, he an- nounced: "Man is condemned to free- dom," for the freedom of the Great Holy Mystery is the most awesome kind of responsibility for self which makes the self responsible by extension only for all men. In short, when one is self-responsi- ble, he assumes responsibility for all men in that he is, in Wah'kon-tah, a part of the whole. Such belief is impossible of fragmenta- tion. It lies at the heart of the transcen- dental philosophy of the New England poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, who at- tempted to explain the concept through the East Indian concept of Brahma. In his poem of the same name, Emerson causes the prime mover of Asia to assert: "When me they fly, I am the wings" and "I am the doubter and the doubt." His Christian daughter assured Emerson his contemporaries would be confused by such mystical subtlety, whereupon Emer- son said they could just read "God" for "Brahma." The concept of the oversoul, so Native American in its transcendence, is still understood by few Christians, for, 263</page><page sequence="9">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION to superimpose God on Brahma or Mani- tou-on any non-anthropomorphic Great Holy Mystery-is to lose the concept in necessary visualization. That poetic, mystical belief in the one- ness of all things is readily apparent in this Omaha chant sung as an "Introduc- tion of a New-Born Child to the Cos- mos": Ho! Ye Sun, Moon, Stars, all ye that move in the heavens, I bid you hear mel Into your midst has come a new life. Consent ye, I implore! Make its path smooth, that it may reach the brow of the first hill! Ho! Ye Winds, Clouds, Rain, Mist, all ye that move in the air, I bid you hear me! Into your midst has come a new life. Consent ye I implore! Make its path smooth, that it may reach the brow of the second hill! Ho! Ye Hills, Valleys, Rivers, Lakes, Trees, Grasses, all ye of the earth, I bid you hear me! Into your midst has come a new life. Consent ye, I implore! Make its path smooth, that it may reach the brow of the third hill! Ho! Ye Birds, great and small, that fly in the air, Ho! Ye Animals, great and small, that dwell in the forest, Ho! Ye Insects that creep among the grasses and burrow in the ground- I bid you hear me! Into your midst has come a new life. Consent ye, I implore! Make its path smooth, that it may reach the brow of the fourth hill! Ho! All ye of the heavens, all ye of the air, all ye of the earth; I bid you all hear me! Into your midst has come a new life. Consent ye, consent ye all, I implore! Make its path smooth-then shall it travel beyond the four hills! And yet, for all the reverence, majesty, and awe of the incantatory word, there was a place in this rich poetic body for the human foibles, the vanities, the con- ceits of man. For instance: perhaps a woman desired the attentions of a man who would give her no second thought. Such an Ojibwa maiden lifted this incan- tation on the air and waited for her will to work its magic through the collective conscious: You are walking around Trying to remember What you promised, But you can't remember. That is faith, indeed, in the collective conscious-a faith that assumes the mes- sage will be transmitted through the tribal intelligence and be heard by the object of the thought because he is an integral part of the whole and cannot escape the thought of any part of the group. That belief can be heard also in this Ojibwa warrior's song: If I die here in a strange land, If I die in a land not my own, Nevertheless, the thunder, The rolling thunder, Will take me home. 264</page><page sequence="10">TRIBAL LITERATURE If I die here, the wind, The wind rushing over the prairie, The wind will take me home. The wind and the thunder, They are the same everywhere. What does it matter, then, If I die here in a strange land? The European concept that only a specified portion of the total earth can serve as repository for the past lies no- where in the Ojibwa poem. Listen to the difference as the idea is stated by the Englishman Rupert Brooke in his widely quoted poem, "The Soldier," written in 1914, when Englishmen did die in the fields of Europe: If I should die, think only this of me: That there's some corner of a foreign field That is forever England. Brooke's lines lack that incantory quality so apparent in the Ojibwa war- rior's line. Perhaps the closeness with the Great Holy Mystery accounts for the dif- ference. Perhaps it also accounts for the prophetic quality of much of the Aztec and Mayan poetry from the books of Chilan Balan, books set down before the arrival of the gold-seeking Europeans. This "Recital of the Priest Chilan" was recorded in the late fifteenth century: Eat, eat, while there is bread, Drink, drink, while there is water; A day comes when dust shall darken the air, When a blight shall wither the land. When a cloud shall arise, When a mountain shall be lifted up, When a strong man shall seize the city, When ruin shall fall upon all things, When the tender leaf shall be de- stroyed, When eyes shall be closed in death; When there shall be three signs on a tree, Father, son and grandson hanging dead on the same tree; When the battle flag shall be raised, And the people scattered abroad in the forests. If St. John was right, God the father and God the holy spirit or word existed simultaneously and, with the crucifixion of God the son, all three were to hang dead on the same tree. Even today, the subtlety of that concept is difficult for the white man. Isn't it odd that it oc- curred to a Mayan priest who had still a few years before he was to know the burnished steel death of the followers of that mystic trinity? And isn't it incredible that the vast body of this recorded litera- ture was burned by the "civilized" Chris- tian destroying men and ideas as he spread Elohim's message of love? The great orations, the messianic lit- erature of Tavebo and Wovoka and Smo- halla, the death songs of Red Bird and Sitting Bull-greatness from the collec- tive conscious is recorded on every hand. Yet the white man in his arrogance and ignorance ignores the recordings until he is faced with ecological crisis. And he misses the radiant creations of N. Scott Momaday, whose House Made of Dawn won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize, the eloquent and vitriolic Vine Deloria, Jr., whose Custer Died for Your Sins moved part of a generation of white youth back toward truth, Ted Berrigan and James Welch, poets of the first rank among contempo- rary Americans, or Peter LaFarge and Buffy Sainte-Marie of the music scene. Oh, the tribal collective conscious still generates a literature that contains un- surpassed beauty. And that beauty will endure as long as the grass shall grow, for the leaves of our literature rustle with the same freshness and truth that pervades the grass-that green hair Smo- halla refused to cut because it was his mother's. And that literature not only will endure, it will grow until such time as the Transplant American can say the final lines of the Beautyway section of the Navaho Night Chant with the Native 265</page><page sequence="11">COLLEGE COMPOSITION AND COMMUNICATION American and understand them because create identity for all Americans, Native he has learned to mean them; then, and and Transplant alike. only then, will a collective conscious As it used to be long ago, may I walk, Happily may I walk, Happily, with abundant dark clouds, may I walk, Happily with abundant showers, may I walk, Happily with abundant plants, may I walk, Happily on a trail of pollen, may I walk, Happily may I walk, Being as it used to be long ago, may I walk, May it be beautiful before me, May it be beautiful behind me, May it be beautiful below me, May it be beautiful above me, May it be beautiful all around me, In beauty it is finished.1 University of South Florida Tampa, Florida 1Portions of this article were adapted from Literature of the American Indian by Thomas E.

The teaching of punctuation is often a mere matter of rules and conven- tions, yet the points of punctuation are primarily rhetorical in nature. The teaching of traditional grammar has degenerated into a grab-bag of rules and exercises, although significant work in the sentence, beyond basic sen- tence patterns and the most elementary modification, is, as Francis Christ- ensen has shown, chiefly rhetorical in purpose. Some of six or eight figures are carefully tucked away in units on poetry for students to infer that figures are archaic toys poets play with because they have nothing better to do. The four forms of discourse are still being advanced as a primary organizing device for composition courses although the four forms do not reflect the reality of modern writing. The insistence by many teachers upon "objective" writing-whatever that is-is contributing to a generation of faceless men and women suffering from the compulsive neurosis of linguistic correctness and cleanliness, harboring a dangerously debased ideal of detachment, and worshipping the Great God IBM.
