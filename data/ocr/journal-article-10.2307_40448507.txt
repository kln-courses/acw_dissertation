The information presented in this paper refers to a group of tribes which formerly dwelt along the coast of southern West Australia in the neighborhood of Bremer Bay and the adjoining inland region. The material is concerned 1 The information given has been taken from a 100.000 word typescript written by Mrs. Hassell entitled "Sketches of Station Life and the Southeastern Natives of Western Australia". As the title suggests, the paper contains a great deal of material which, although important for those interested in pioneer days, is beyond the interest of the anthropologist. The notes presented herewith have been selected with the view of making known the few ethnological data which exist for a now extinct group of tribes. The experience of Mrs. Hassell with the peoples concerned dates from 1870 when, as a girl, she commenced her married life on a sheep ranch in this frontier region. Her husband had then been in the locality for fourteen years so that his knowledge goes back to 1856, a time when many of the natives had never seen a European. During her many years of contact with the aborigines Mrs. Hassell acquired a great deal of first-hand in- formation and made inquiries on many points of native life. Not being a trained observer, her material contains many gaps of importance which is to be regretted, for the natives are now entirely extinct. It is fortunate, however, that she had the interest to record what she did see, for we thus have some detailed descriptions of many things and customs which otherwise would have been entirely unknown. This paper contains only ethnological material, myths and folktales are to be presented elsewhere. (Mythology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia). The typescript was secured by the editor (D. S. D.) when he was in Australia as a Fellow of the Social Science Research Council.</page><page sequence="2">680 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, specifically with the Wheelman tribe, which lived about sixty miles from the coast but also applies in a more or less similar manner to their neighbors. These include the Mongup tribe further inland, the Caractterup tribe, the K/u* Kar, which lived more towards Esperance Bay, the Qualup tribe and their coastal neighbors, the Bremer Bay tribe. The population of these tribes, as a group or individually, cannot be stated, but a gathering of 200 or more natives at tribal meetings was not uncommon in the early days of European intrusion. In the neighboring regions the population was certainly less, for desert conditions are met with on the north and east. In the west, where the country is rocky and salty, there were but few natives in the Porrongerup and Stirling Ranges. A compara- tively large population, however, was found in the Fitzgerald Ranges and beyond Bremer Bay. The boundaries of each of the tribes were well defined in the minds of the natives and known to all. The language of the Wheelman and their neighbors is similar to that spoken throughout southwestern Australia. Many of their words are mono- syllabic or foisyllabic, whereas west of the Stirling Ranges an additional syllable was usually added. For instance Wheelman coot, bag, becomes coota; twonk, talk, becomes twonka; york, wife, becomes yorka. North of Perth still another syllable was added. There was a great deal of repetition in the lan- guage because of the lack of generic names for birds, animals, snakes and the like. The native had to list specifically each one concerned and repeat the entire list every time whereas in English we would speak of them as a group. There were no swear words in their language; the only form of oral abuse was to make remarks about one another's personal appearance. They were very careful how they spoke of the evil spirits lest they suffer evil consequences by offending them. Indeed, it was very difficult to make them speak of these at all lest descriptive remarks be considered disparaging. The possession of fire was involved with their respect for the evil spirits and since the coming of matches they have not been quite so reluctant to talk of them. The natives of this region were not uniform in color. Some might be termed a chocolate black, others reddish-black, charcoal^black or sooty^black. Still others were slightly more brown. Measurements of stature were not taken, but one man, who had an especially fine physique, was about five feet, ten inches tall. Some of the females were not taller than five feet. A strange native (pardoak) from the desert country, who was captured at one time and brought to the station with his two wives, was below five feet in stature. He had an exceedingly low forehead, small eyes, flat nose, very wide nostrils, a very short upper lip, a large, heavy lower jaw, rather broad shoulders, narrow hips, spindle legs, long arms and a heavy hair covering. Long hair and heavy beards were very rare among the local natives. This native was also characterized by five fingers and a thumb on each hand and six toes on each foot, as were also both of his wives. Their language was not understood by the Wheelman. They greedily ate sugar which was given them, but spat out tea, flour, and salt meat. They ate raw kangaroo meat but refused any</page><page sequence="3">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 681 that had been cooked. The fresh meat which they did not eat was placed in a hole in the ground over which they slept, and thus protected until morning. On cold nights they scraped away a fire prepared for the purpose and slept in the warmed sand. Their skins were harsh and rough. Their clothes con- sisted of a skin knotted around the waist and allowed to hang in front. Nothing is known about the desert tribes by the local natives. II. Political Organization. Settlers sometimes speak of the headman as a chief or king. As far as could be learned, however, the Wheelman tribe, the largest in the neighbor- hood, had no individual of this character. The tribe lived as a community, each man governing his own home and family, and each family being quite independent of any other. When game was brought into the camp it was shared by all and no important enter/prize was undertaken until it had been thoroughly discussed by all. In hunting they made up their own parties and went in small bands. When they went into battle, a chief or leader was selected for that battle. Sometimes he had led them several times before, but he might be one who had never done so. These matters were apparently determined by the success or popularity of the individual. There were certain fixed laws which it was everyone's duty to see en- forced. Their mulgar(s) or medicine men had a great deal of influence as had also their wise women, and these people determined whether any lawis had been broken. The whole tribe inflicted the punishment upon the guilty parties. Different tribes had different punishments, which were well known to all. Although the people lived together, it was not unusual for a man to take his family for a waander, or bush walk, and to remain away from the tribe for months. In some indescribably way, however, the main tribe gene- rally seemed to know how to communicate with them if necessary. III. Birth Customs, Betrothal and Marriage. Birth always took place, if possible, in the country of the tribe. If a preg- nant woman was visiting another tribe every effort was made to return home before the child was born. About a week before a birth was expected the mother retired from the main camp to an especially constructed hut called a mia mia (mia, ordinary hut). Her friends took care of any childred she might have, who were not permitted even to approach the confinement hut. This hut was rather large and had a smaller one attached to it at one side. A fire was made in front of the entrance and a break-wind placed between the fire and the wind, so as to give good shelter. The women prepared a large quantity of fine white wood ashes by rubbing them between the fingers. These ashes were taken into the little hut and stored on the floor. A thick bed of leaves was also placed on the floor of the smaller hut. The birth took place outside of the huts under a large tree and on a bed of leaves. The same tree does not seem to have been used twice within a three- year period. The baby was taken by the mother or grandmother, who usually attended the case, and immediately held over the smoke of a small fire made of</page><page sequence="4">682 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, green gum leaves. It was then taken into the smaller hut and powdered with the wood ashes. The mother was assisted to the hut and the bed on which the birth took place was immediately burned. The mother and her party remained in their secluded camp for a period of four weeks, during which time neither she nor the baby visited the main camp nor did they receive the visits of any men. While there the baby was not bathed but sprinkled with the ashes three times a 'day. As soon as the mia mia was left for the return to the main camp it was burned» The natives were very kind to their children but showed no affection or even consideration for animals. The families were not large, and there were long intervals between the births. Almost as soon as a girl baby was born the subject of her betrothal arose. All girl babies were betrothed to a youth or man, who had to provide a certain amount of food for the child until she became old enough to marry him. When a man thus contributed to her support from infancy he was said to "grow" her. If her parents died or were killed, or the mother captured by another tribe, he had to care for her. In such an event she was under the protection of his female relatives until she became his wife. If he was a married man his wife would have the duty of bringing up her infant rival. It was not unusual to find two wives of a man of greatly different ages and, as a rule, they were great friends. The younger one helped with the children and took care of the older one in case of illness. The older one always assisted the younger one at the births of the latter's children. In some cases a betrothed youth did not wish to marry the child brought up for him. He was allowed to avoid the obligation only if his next of kin would assume it. There was apparently no wedding ceremony except that a man pulled a few hairs from his wife's head and she bound these through his barlee, or arm band. The plucking and binding was done in the presence of several members of the tribe. After this procedure the wife accompanied her husband to his mia, or hut and after a day or two they generally went away together for a bush walk. The natives had various degrees of consanguinity in which it was a sin to marry, so that kinship always had to be determined before a marriage or betrothal took place. If people married outside the proper relationship there was only one punishment: they were killed, as was any issue of their union. Punishment was more severe on the woman than on the man for should the pair escape and the woman die the man was sometimes accepted back in the tribe. The woman, however, regardless of the circumstances, was never per- mitted to return. She was much (wrong woman) and that was all there was to it. An alien wife, because of dissatisfaction with her adopted tribe, often eloped with another man. Her husband, however, always had a prior claim to her and could force her to return. General opinion was on his side and fierce fights were often waged as a consequence, for once a woman was received into a tribe by a barlee marriage she belonged to that tribe and all</page><page sequence="5">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 683 the men resented her trying to leave it. An elopement in such a case was not only regarded as an insult to the husband but also to the tribe as a whole. If a man suspected that his wife was planning to run off he usually threw plain hunting spears through the calves of her legs to prevent it, a procedure which was often done merely to show authority. The status of a wife by conquest was quite different from that of one married by barlee. The children of such a woman belonged to the husband and took their descent from him, They belonged to his tribe and should the mother be exchanged, bartered or ransomed she could not take her children with her. Should the matter be settled while she was pregnant she had to remain until the child was born and old enough to be left. If she succeeded in escaping and rejoining her tribe she could not be claimed, but the child could be, and generally it was given up without trouble. If a man had a wife by conquest and subsequently married her by barlee she then assumed all the rights of the ordinary wife. A wife by conquest was not bound in any way. If she could escape she was free to do so. A wife was expected to make the hut, tend the fire, oil and massage her husband when he was tired, spin his belts, make his cloaks and help in the manufacture of spears and other tools and weapons. In return, the husband furnished food and protection for his family. He always walked shead when on the march with his spears ready. If a man and wife were married by barlee the children took their descent from the mother. The descent of a child was usually spoken of by listing the female ancestors on the maternal side as follows; Way men, the female child of Greton; Greton, the female child of Tupin, &amp;c. However, if there had been a wife. by conquest in one of the generations, the name of her husband would appear in the geneology and everyone would know from the masculine name that his wife had been one by conquest. Such a condition would not cast any slur upon the children. IV. Baby Carrying. The baby was not carried in the coot (bag) but was placed between the cloak and the mother's bare body. The child faced to the front with its stomach against the back of the mother, its head resting on her shoulder, and its arms projecting out oiver the edge of the cloak. When it required nourishment the breast was lifted to the shoulder and the child sucked as the mother traveled along. The cloak was fastened together by a wooden pin, leaving the arms of the wearer free. The bag was slung by its strap over the cloak and thus helped to support the child. On a few occasions it was noticed that young girls were taken away to visit another tribe some distance away and that they returned pregnant, but without having been married. In each case they were accompanied by an old man and woman. The natives explained that this was done in order to bring new blood into the tribe. Such children were considered as belonging to the tribe. Although all of the girls married local husbands shortly after</page><page sequence="6">684 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, their babies were born, the stepfathers had no particular hand in their bringing up. Polygamy was commonly practiced but no case was ever noticed in which a man had more than two permanent wives. Upon the death of a man his wives were added to the family of his brother until a new husband could be found. V. Moieties and Totems. The Wheelman and neighboring tribes were divided into moieties named N unnica (meaning?) and Wording (black crow). A Nunnich must marry only a Wording. In a few instances it seemed as if both were represented in the same family but I think I was misunderstood in my questions or mis- interpreted the answers. The natives were very apt to tell you on one occasion, only what they wanted you to know, or, on another, what they thought you wanted to know. Every native had one or more totems which he was not allowed to eat or destroy. The totems were arranged according to their importance in the following way; these that fly were of the highest degree, then things that climb, then those that run or jump; then flying insects, then creeping insects, then lizards and iguanas or monitors, then snakes, then trees and lastly grasses. A totem was called a couburne. The following are examples: mopoak, blue crane, wild dog, duck, large ant, chuck (a cherry-like fruit), &amp;c. The descent of the totem was matrilineal. VI. Yardie. A yardie was the most important ceremonial meeting the natives held. It dit not take place at definite intervals but only for some very important matter to be discussed and the boys' initiation was arranged there. Groups came from all directions and remained until the game in the region had been exhausted. Corrobborees were held every night and everyone enjoyed himself to the utmost. When the tribes returned to their own country each was accompanied by the young men who had been allotted to it for tribal instruction. These boys often remained away a year or even longer and sometimes visited other tribes before they returned to their homes. In some cases after a yardie a number of young girls of marriageable age were taken to visit various tribes. They were always chaperoned by an old man and woman of their tribe and returned within a year. Many friendships were thus formed and marriages were often contracted as a result of these visits. A yardie, however, was not altogether peaceful, for many tribes being usually present, there were always old feuds and differences to be adjusted. There were frequent fights over these matters but all had to be settled before the yardie ended, for no feud could be carried over. Th tribes did not depart from the yardie all at once, but singly. The last tribe set fire to all the huts and completely destroyed everything. These ceremonies did not have a fixed duration, but varied from a few weeks to as</page><page sequence="7">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 685 long as two months. It was noticeable that after a yardie food restrictions and various rites were always more closely observed. When tribes met for a yardie or other ceremony they camped in different quarters so that they had a chance to escape if a serious fight started. At a yardie in particular, however, several huts were erected apart from the others for the young men of marriageable age (gnarnock). This camp was in charge of some of the old men. At another point a similar camp was built for the young marriageable girls (grane), who were guarded by the old women. Between these two camps was another with larger huts where the young men took the girls after it had been decided who were to wed. They lived in one of these huts for two or three days and then rejoined their tribe, or went away, and another couple took their place. Some of the boys were sometimes apportioned to the old women but afterwards took young wives. Since these meetings did not take place at stated intervals the marriages which had taken place during the interim had to be ratified at a yardie and divorces were also arranged for those not satisfied with their marriages. Those who took advantage of the yardie to become permanently separated, however, lost a certain amount of social prestige. VIL Noilyet. Just before the boys left the parent tribe to go away with another tribe as part of their initiation they had to go through the ceremony of noilyet, or the piercing of the septum of the nose. They were gathered together and each held by his father or next of kin, who firmly held the head between his hands while the mitigar pierced the septum with a sharp pointed stick and then inserted a piece of kangaroo bone. This was about two and one half inches long and one eight inch thick. The ends were finely ground to sharp points. One side was slightly rounded, the other flat. This bone, which was called noilyet, was worn until the boy returned from his long visit. On his return and before he took a wife it was withdrawn by the mitigar in the presence of the entire tribe. He was then considered a man and admitted to all the privileges of the men, but as long as he stayed away from his tribe the bone might not be removed for any reason. When the men went to war these bones were placed in the noise of each by the mitigar and were worn until peace was made. Should a native be sent on a peace errand he went alone and wore his nose-bone with am upward turn. At all other times it was worn straight across his face. A messenger could thus be recognized by all who saw him. When he entered the camp of the enemy he was required by coustom to go straight to the hut of the mitigar before speaking to anyone. Trade was one of the most characteristic traits of all great native meetings although it was also carried on from group to group at all times. The Wheelman tribe secured their unburned wilgie from the inland tribes and pods of mungite honey from the coastal people, giving in return spear sticks, prepared stone flakes, throwing-sticks and foods. Articles were often traded for hundreds of miles.</page><page sequence="8">686 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, Directions were spoken of by reference to the winds. The north wind was called youler; the east wind, dedart; the south wind, wanningong; and the west wind, churineth. VIH. Poining Gumbar. Paining Gumbar, or the making of blood brothers, could take place at any age, but a boy was first made Poining Giimber when residing with a neighboring tribe for his tribal instruction. Each boy selected as a chum some boy of the other tribe, the one he liked the best, or the one with whom he had been most intimate during his sojourn. This ceremony was the most important of their rites and took place in the presence of the entire tribe. The two boys stood side by side by the fire facing the tribe. The mitigar made small incisions on their right or left breasts, arms or back according to the particular custom, of the tribe. Blood wais taken from each lad, mixed on a flat stone with wood ashes and then rubbed into the wounds and allowed to dry. The skin rose in a weal and formed scars about half an inch long. Boys thus inoculated were called Poining Poining(s) or blood brothers and were expected to help each other at all times regardless of circumstances. Even in a fight between their tribes the one was bound to help the other, against his own kin if necessary. Some boys contracted more than one blood brother of the same or different tribes for they were often away from their home tribe two or three years and therefore, might have cicatrices on both their chests and backs. They were then said to be Poining Gumbar 2. The bond between Poining Gumbar(s) was a great safeguard against tribal warfare and individuals so related were usually the ones sent on peace errands. In aboriginal days it was assumed that the greater number of Poining Gumbar(s) in a tribe the greater was the chance of being at peace with its neighbors. For these reasons the ceremony was regarded as most important although sometimes rivaled by that of Noilyet. Neither circumcision nor subincision were practiced by the tribes of this region. Tooth avulsion was not performed by the Wheelman but the Kar Kar tribe knocked out one upper front tooth of a woman at the time of her marriage. The girls were deflowered about a week before marriage, the ceremony being performed by two old women with a blunt-ended, round stick which hat been scraped smooth and well greased. It was burned imme- diately after use. IX. Games. There were not many games, dances and corrobberees being the main source of amusement. One game resembled hockey. It was played with a short marlock stick with a round burnt root at the end. The ball was also made from a root by being rounded, covered with clay and hardened in the fire. The game was played by sides of no particular number. A player when tired took a rest and was replaced by anyone else who liked to do so. The game seemed to have no particular time limit but continued until all were 2 Compare gumbar with coombah, great. (D. S. D.)</page><page sequence="9">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 687 tired. This game was played in fits, sometimes becoming so popular that it was played every day by everyone for a week. Another game was played with a circle of bark out from the White Gum tree. The bark is about one and one-half inches thick. It was cut into a large circle about three feet in diameter. This was trundled along the ground or down a hill and the natives tried to spear it as it rolled along. A short spear about four feet long was used. A similar contest of skill consisted in throwing spears at a small bough on a fairly high tree with the object of hitting the bark. Other games were played with boomerangs, some being thrown into the air to return to the thrower, others along the ground to make them hop. Differently shaped boomerangs were used for the two games, which were played only by men. The women played only hockey and a game in which each tried to strike her opponent with a digging-stick in offence and fend off blows in defence. The universal call of the Australian native is supposed to be cooee, but in southwestern Australia this was true for only the coast natives. It was an imitation of the cooeyah, a very long legged, short, brown frog which buries itself in the white sand along the coast but does not extend very far inland. The call of the natives of the interior was youaal. Almost every letter was drawled out separately and the last syllable was given in a very high key. All native calls began in a low key and ended in almost a shriek. These calls carried for a very long way. X. Rotundity of the Earth. The earth was considered round like a ball. The natives argued that everything was round. Wherever one stood and looked things seemed to be thus. If a baby was put down he would not run straight like a fence but around in circles. If sheep got lost they ran around and around. Kangaroos did not run straight but around and around like the sheep. When a white man got lost he walked around in circles. Where the sky touches the earth it is round. Trees are round, and bushes are round. It was just natural for everything to be round, hence why not the earth? XI. System of Counting. The system of counting embraced only the fingers, the thumbs being disregarded- After the four fingers of the right hand had been counted they start on the left hand and count only the first three fingers. The fourth finger which ordinarily should be considered as eight was regarded as many. In other words both hands indicate an indefinite number. The counting runs in the following order: calne, one - the first finger of the right hand. coogal, two - the second finger of the right hand. merding, three -the third finger of the right hand. moe, four - the fourth finger of the right hand. moe calne, five - the first finger of the left hand. moe coogal, six - the second finger of the left hand.</page><page sequence="10">688 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, mendin moe, seven - the third finger of the left hand. boolah, many - both hands. coombah boolah, a great many. XII. Food. For tadge (food) practically everything edible was eaten. Meat was secured from all the animals and birds of the region and this primary diet was supplemented by all kinds of insects, grubs and wild plant foods. Meals did not occur regularly but only when food was available, at which time they ate as much as they needed and brought the rest to camp. Food was sought during the day by small groups but, when ¡possible, all ate supper together at sunset. Food restrictions were determined by age and sex. Young people were not allowed to eat wild dog or eaglehawk. Should they catch them they were required to bring them to camp and hand them over to the old people. Certain meats were eaten only by the men. Other meats were restricted to married folk. An example of how penalty for violation often took care of itself, esptecially in respect to the young people, is indicated in the following happening. One time several of the young boys had been out hunting and had found in the hollow of a tree the nest of a wild dog with five puppies in it. Being hungry, they agreejd to eat two and take three back to the camp, for a litter often has only three in it. Accordingly they ate two pu'pipies and carefully burned the bones so that their crime would not be detected. They had also eaten a quantity of wild cherries. They had not been back in the camp long before they became ill. To them there was only one explanation, and they all finally confessed their guilt. As a punishment they were ordered to bring to the camp everything they caught in the bush. The medicinenman explained to them that transgression of the rules had brought on all their suffering, and convinced them that they would suffer similarly for a similar misdeed. Water, as in other parts of Australia, was one of the main problems of the natives. There are small streams and lakes which often dry up during the hot weather but many of these are brackish at best. In times of severe drought even the waterholes become dry. Under such conditions in aboriginal days the natives had to depend more or less upon what they called a yamma, a large round hole in a rock worn out by some natural force. The opening is usually small compared with the bottom for they usually widen as they go down. The rain water collects in these holes and is preserved all summer. Water supplies of this kind were greatly prized by the natives for usually there were great numbers of birds and game around them. They vary in size considerably, some holding only a few hundred gallons, others several thou- sands. The various foods eaten include the following: bardie - a large white grub found in roots and under the bark of many trees. It was greatly prized and eaten raw or roasted. The taste resembles pounded almonds and cream.</page><page sequence="11">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 689 gilgie - a fresh water crayfish. mein - a tall, edible, rush-like plant with a black stem. The roots are bright red in color and like a leek in shape. The juice leaves a red stain. The roots are sweet, juicy and hot. meen - gum from the wattle tree. It forms in soft and sticky lumps gathered by the women and pressed into large, round balls. When wanted for food, lumps were knocked off and chewed. They were sometimes heated until soft before the pieces were detached. quirting - a plant which grows like a flag. It has a broad, light green leaf and a root like a leek. It grows six or eight inches into the ground and is deep salmon in color. The taste is like a chili or pepper. wolgol - a kind of nut called quondong in eastern Australia. The trees are tall and not unlike a cherry tree, while yellowish pale green leaves are shaped like a narrow pear leaf. The berries are red, resembling a large deep-red cherry. The thick skin is separated from the stone by only a little flesh. The deeply crinkled stones have a slightly tart flavor. The kernals taste like Brazilian nuts. Stones vary from the size of a small marble to that of two thumbs. chuck - wild cherry. This is a graceful tree something like a weeping willow in habit, with pale green and narrow leaves. The fruit grows all along the stems between the leaves and is like a small red currant. Green seeds, about the size of grape seeds, grow on the outside near the ends. They have a sharp bitter flavor. The fruit is sub-acid like a currant. It was collected by spreading cloaks under the trees and shaking them. mungah - a tall tree with deep orange-colored blossoms. The natives dug up the suckers, which are numerous, peeled off the pale yellow outer bark, and ate the moist brittle center which tastes like sugar candy. poilyenum - a sandal-wood which has a round red seed. The skin of the seed is tough and tastes like alum. The nut has a smooth surface, a brown color, and is about the size of a large marble. The kernals are oily and have a bitter flavor. They were sometimes eaten but generally were pounded by the women into oil for rubbing on the bodies of the men. The smell is not unpleasant but soon becomes rank. youck - a sort of yam. The size varies from that of a thumb to as large as three-quarters of a pound. The roots may be red, pink or yellowish white according to the color of the ground they are in. The plants are round, small, scrubby bushes about two feet high and have a small sage green leaf. The roots spread over a considerable area and have tubers at their extremities. mungite - a species of banishia (?) which grows on the coast and near creeks. It has peculiar seeds, two kinds growing on each bush. One is about six inches long by two inches in diameter and has a hard, grey surface. Under the grey surface, which can be rubbed off, is a dark brown velvety stuff which covers a hard stick about a half-inch thick. The other seed is ten inches long and four inches wide and tapers at each end. The surface is dotted with hard seed pods each about the size and appearance of a thumb. The pods have a soft, grey covering which is pushed aside as they ripen to disclose two black seeds, which float away with the breeze. The large nuts were greatly used by the natives for fire. A few placed together will smoulder all night and give off a pleasant heat. The flowers are about four inches long and are composed of slender stems. The podless ones have the longest blossoms. At the base of the flowers there are quantities of honey, which can be easily sucked out. The honey was traded from the coast inland and could be kept for about a week. The birds and ants are fond of the honey, too, so that great numbers of birds were also available for food when these plants were in bloom.</page><page sequence="12">690 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, quonert - a native food consisting of the mixture of seeds from the black wattle and raspberry jam trees ground into a meal and mixed with yate. The seed of the black wattle is called wuanga. The yate is a species of Eucalyptus from which the sap was secured by scrapping pieces of bark stripped from the tree. The sap is a thick, purplish syrup, which is very sweet. It was carried in containers made of bark by curling in the sides and bending up the ends. It was often eaten like honey and tastes like molasses. In preparing quonert the pods of both trees were brought into camp in the women's bags. They were spread on the cloaks and allowed to open by the heat of the sun. The light pods were allowed to blow away and the seeds were put back in the bags which were then hung on the pole of the hut. They were the common property of all the women and when wanted, the quantity needed, never more, was placed upon a large grinding stone which had been heated by the fire. The centers of these stones were usually slightly hollowed by repeated chipping with a stone hammer. The seeds were rolled with another stone until thoroughly ground. This process was usually one of great amusement, the seeds being hard and hopping in all directions. The meal was more or less sticky because of the oil in the seeds. It was mixed with water, fat, yate sap or finely powdered mana gum, made into small flat cakes and baked in hot wood ashes. carta - the iguana (Gould's Monitor). The eggs were highly prized for food. They are about the size of pidgeon eggs and have a tough outer skin but no shell. When roasted in wood ashes they taste like a rich custard, for the yolk and white seem mixed together. They were restricted to the old men and women. took el youk - hatched ant eggs. The white ants or termites make pointed mounds about four feet high for their nests, which were called weet. The outer crusts are solid and about a foot thick. The center is composed of dry, powdery sand and numerous brown cells attached to the hard crust. The ants pass through four stages according to the natives. The first stage, the new egg, was called coul; the second, when the eggs hatch, being designated as took el youk. It is at this stage that they were eaten. A little later when the cells become hard and have young ants in them they were called carhil and were not often eaten. Finally, when winged and able to fly, the ants were called gnorlap. The women collected this food by knocking off the top of the ant will with their digging-sticks. They then made a sieve of rushes twisted in and out to form a mesh and bound with dried grass at each end. The soft earth and eggs were placed in the sieve and rocked gently to and fro until the earth had been blown away. The eggs were then kneaded into the quonert and baked in cakes. Some- times the eggs were roasted on a flat stone in the center of a small fire. XIII. Technology. The material culture of the Wheelman and their neighbors was very simple. The most important weapon was the spear, geize (singular and plural) . There were hunting spears and fighting spears. They varied in length from six to eight feet and were not ornamented in any way. Fighting spears» Fighting spears were of two varieties. One had a barb, three inches long by one-half inch thick, attached to the very tip of the spear with kangaroo sinew and blackboy gum. The other, geize tap, or spear knife, had the end covered for several inches with gum into which were inserted in one continuous line several small flakes of stone. Hunting spears. Hunting spears were plain, straight sticks sharpened at the end. Spears were generally made from Mallee or Mongup trees, the</page><page sequence="13">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 691 woods of which are strong and well suited to this purpose. The natives often concealed their spears by holding them between the toes and dragging them through the grass. Spears were usually thrown with the aid of a meera or spearthrower, generally made from "raspberry jam" wood and about two feet. long, six inches wide and onehalf inch thick. The peg was a small wooden pin about one half inch long fastened to one end with gum and kangaroo sinew. The other end of the meera had a piece of gum for a handle. A kangaroo tooth was often embedded in the gum for use as a knife. Jarrah and Manet woods were also used in the manufacture of this implement. Shields were much smaller than those used by northern tribes. They were perfectly plain and made of polished hard wood. The Wheelman used two kinds of knives besides the point in the end of the spearthrower. The tap was made on the order of the geize tap by inserting a row of stone flakes into a gum surface on a stick. The stick was round, about seven inches long, and of hard wood. One end was blunt and slightly flattened for about three inches. The gum for the flakes covered this surface. The other end of the knife was pointed and was used as an aid in climbing trees. A hole for the big toe was made in the bark with an axe. The end of the knife was then stuck into the bark higher up on the tree and gave a hand-hold to climb to the next hole. It was used in the same manner for descending the tree. The woman's knife differed from the men's instrument. It consisted of a stick with a kangaroo tooth embedded in gum at one end. It was used in scraping skins, cutting sinews, and for skinning. The women were able to skin a kangaroo with it as rapidly as a man with a European knife. The dwark was a throwing-stick made of heavy wood. It was about three feet long by two inches in diameter. The ends were pointed and sharpened. This implement was used to kill small game and also in fighting after the spears had been thrown. The boomerang, kyle, was made from a flat, almost half-moon-shaped piece of wood, bent in a sharp curve. It was more of a plaything than a weapon, but was used in warfare after the spears had been discharged. It can inflict a deep wound. Some of the boomerangs were of the returning type. The hoitch or axe was of two types. In one a single stone with a sharp edge was fastened to a stick with a lump of gum. The other type consisted of two stones, lying in the same plane on two sides of the stick, all being securely fastened with gum, which covered the end of the stick and part of each stone. The other end of the stick was sharpened. The women's characteristic tool and weapon, offensive and defensive, was the wanna or digging-stick. It was not quite as long as a spear but much thicker. One end was sharpened for digging roots and making the holes for the supporting posts of the hut. The Wheelman had no means of carrying water except a makeshift bark utensil seldom employed. On occasion they would strip a broad piece of bark from a tree and make a crude vessel by doubling up the ends and allowing the sides to take their natural curve. This was used to carry a little water for Anthropos XXXI. 1936. , 3</page><page sequence="14">692 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, mixing their cakes from the waterhole to the camp.' It was never used for a long journey. There was never any drinking water in the camp so the natives always made a trip to the waterhole after their meal. They scooped the fluid up in the hollow of their hands and drank very sparingly. None of the natives in this region had any knowledge of water-craft. They generally walked to the heads, bends or shallow places of the rivers, and crossed with the help of fallen logs, used only as aids to support them as they swam. They did not like to cross in this way but prefered to wade with the help of long sticks. They seemed never to swim for pleasure but often waded waist-deep along the shores and the heads of estuaries to spear fish. All wood for spears and other weapons was seasoned by being baked in hot ashes. The weapons were well greased with fat and at frequent intervals were regreased. Great care was taken in selecting the wood to be used in their manufactures. Wood-carving was done only on letter sticks. Fire (carl) played an important part in almost everything the natives did. If they sat down for a talk a fire was always built, even if it was to be deserted in a few minutes. At all of the ceremonies, whether held by day or by night, fires were regularly made and attended. Two fires were kindled at the camps, one for the natives, the other for the spirits. The same was true for the grave fires» Fire was made either by sawing or drilling. Fine pulverized kangaroo dung was used for tinder. These were laborious processes, especially in damp weather. Natives have been known travel fifty miles to borrow fire when, from rain or carelessness, all the camp fires had gone out. On the march fire was always carried along smouldering in a caria. The latter was extinguished when camp was made, but when camp was deserted, it was relit and carried on. Letter sticks were of three kinds, varying in purpose and in appearance. A cort was a love stick; a yourp, an evil magic stick; and á yoump, a battle challenge stick. The cort was sent by young men to young women. It was usually four to six inches long and was carved with squares, oblongs and circles according to the fancy of the carver. The ends are rounded and smeared with wilgie, the thickness of which indicated the degree of affection of the sender. The carving was done with a sharp piece of stone or the front tooth of a kangaroo. The yoump was usually about six to seven inches long and about two inches in diameter. The ends were either rounded or pointed. The engravings varied. In one specimen I saw, straight lines covered half its length. For the next two inches wavy bands passed around it. Then there were some squares and finally some small rings which encircled the other end. Blood was smeared over each end for about an inch, and a long human hair was wound in each. Another example had long lines engraved on it to represent spears. Two oval lines which looked something like a spear-thrower were carved at each end. One end was split and had a piece of sharp stone inserted. The whole end was</page><page sequence="15">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 693 bound with hair and smeared with blood» At the other end there was a long woman's hair, which was also smeared with blood. A bag or coot was made from a young male kangaroo skin prepared like the skins for cloaks. It was doubled up so that the hind legs formed the band which went around the neck, while the neck of the animal served as the flap to cover the mouth of the bag. The sides of the bag were securely sewn together with kangaroo sinews. A bag is used to carry all the household goods and food, but little of the latter was taken along since the natives preferred to trust to luck for something to eat when on the march. The typical contents of a coot may be listed as follows. One or more awls of kangaroo bone. These were about seven or eight inches long and one-eights of an inch thick. One side was flattened, the other rounded. A bundle of dried kangaroo tail sinews rolled in a ring. A women's knife. A cobal, or small bag made from the paunch of the opossum, scraped and turned inside out. It was usually filled with plucked opossum fur for spinning. A spindle whorl. One or more magic stones. Sewing was performed by holding the sides of two skins together and forcing a hole through them with an awl. Dry sinew was then threaded through the hold and drawn tight. The holes were spaced about a quarter of an inch apart, but since the stitches were over-sewn the seam was very strong. It was dampened when finished and set very firmly. Of the spindle whorl, waupull, there were two kinds. The first was com- posed of two sticks pointed at the ends. The larger one was about eight inches long, the smaller about four inches. Both had diameters of about one-half inch. There was a hole in the larger stick about three inches from one end and through this the smaller stick was inserted to form a cross. As the strand was spun the finished string was wound around the cross arm until it had been filled. The second type was made by three sticks. The main stick was about eight inches long and somewhat thicker than the first described. Two holes were made in it, each about three inches from the ends, andt through these the other sticks were inserted* They were kept in place by small pieces of wool. Their string was made exclusively from the fur of the large grey opossum. The fur was plucked by hand while the body was still warm and tightly packed into a bag called the cobal, made from the paunch of the animal. This was scraped and turned inside out. The winter fur, being denser and firmer, was preferred to the summer fur. In spinning the operator first seated herself on a log of wood and drew her cloak to one side to expose her left side. The fur was drawn by the left hand from the cobal through the end where the gut had been severed, The end of the waupull was inserted in the fur and the stick rolled on the left thigh by the right hand. This movement twisted the fur into worsted. When several inches of string had been made, the twisting movement stopped, the fur was wound about the cross-stick and the movement then continued as before. The string 3*</page><page sequence="16">694 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, was kept on the cross-stick until the latter was full. It was then taken off and wound into a ball. An many an two hundred yards were often wound into one ball. The strand was about the thickness of four-ply Beehive Fingering. It was strong and delightfully soft. Both man and women were expert spinners. A number of objecta were made from this string, the most important being the noolman or men's belt. These belts are about two inches thick and vary in width from three to five inches. Each belt had to be wound to fit its wearer, so that in times of famine the entire belt had to be unwound and rewound to fit. Since this required an entire morning's work changes were not frequent. Other objects made with string were the barlkey and barlee. The former was a one inch band of a few strands worn around the head as a corrobboree ornament. The barlee was a ligature of a half dozen strands worn around the upper part of the right arm. Blackboy Gum was used with practically everything the natives made. Its botanical name is Kanthorrhoca Pressi This plant has a round black trunk which grows in rings or layers something like a palm. It attains a height of from ten to fourteen feet and has a crown of long, dark green, grass-like leaves which drop down as they die. They are always dry underneath. From the middle of the rushes a long, dark, shiny, green flower-stem grows. This is about two inches thick. It is covered with soft, green, furry buds about half way up the stem. As the season advances the color of the stem turns into a shiny brown and the green, mossy buds burst into a mass of sweet-scented white flowers, followed later by hard, shiny, long brown seeds. One variety has several branches springing from the head of the parent trunk and each branch has its separate stem with its crown of flowers. The whole plant is full of dark red resinous gum which is beaten out, softened with fire and kneaded until of the consistency of putty, in which form it can be moulded into any shape required. When cold it is as hard as stone. XIV. Clothing and Ornaments. The natives had only two important articles of clothing, the cloak and the belt. The men's cloak was called quark; the women's, baark. The belt, nool- burn, was made of spun opossum fur. A small flap, about ten inches square, made from the skin of a kangaroo tail, hung in front. The belt was a general carry-all in which were stuck extra spears, a boomerang or two, throwing-sticks and knives. The cloaks were made from kangaroo skins by the women» The kangaroo was the only animal skinned, others being thrown into the fire to singe off the fur. They were then scraped like pig skins. In making a cloak the kangaroo was opened down the stomach and the skin removed. It was carefully scraped with a woman's knife and rubbed down with a stone. This rubbing was repeated every few days for a time. Five or more skins were used in a cloak, depending upon their size as well as the wearer's. The skins were sewn together from the neck downwards. A cloak, when finished, covered the entire body and hung</page><page sequence="17">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 695 to the knees. The ends of the hind legs were not shaped but allowed to dangle around the wearer's legs. The top was fastened around the neck by inserting a small piece of wood into a tag on one side drawn through a hole in the other. A second fastening was made a few inches below the first. The garment was comfortable to wear and did not interfere with the free use of the limbs. The coastal tribes used a bit of mutton-fish shell instead of the piece of wood to hold the cloak together. The men's cloaks were not quite so long or wide as the women's. The right shoulder and arm were not covered in order that the spear-thrower, which was carried in the right hand, might be used at a moment's notice. In addition to their use as clothing the cloaks served as blankets at night. They were also employed as containers for collecting seeds. The furry side was worn outside in the summer and inside during the wet winter months. Objects of adornment include: borice - an arm ligature made of three or four strands of spun opossum fur. It was important in the marriage ceremony, when a few strands of the wife's hair were woven in it by her. It was worn by the husband. barlkey - a fillet or head-dress in the form of a band of spun opossum fur. It was sometimes dusted with wilgie, both burned and unburned. The hair, within the barlkey, might also be covered. tyre - a head ornament worn in front of the barlkey. The twert-tyre was made from two or three tails of the wild dog, and two pieces of skin from the inside of the hind leg fastened around a small stick with blackboy gum. On each side other small sticks were often placed and to these the flowers of a pretty, pink everlasting were bound with dried grass. There were other ornaments which vary according to the totemic affiliation of the wearer. One such example, worn by a man leaving on his bush walk, or honeymoon, consisted of some pale blue feathers of the blue crane, his totem, and some black wing feathers of the wild duck, the totem of his wife. The body and all objects were decorated with wilgie, a kind of yellow clay burned and mixed with grease. Put on a man's head it was a sign he was courting. If a woman failed to remove any remaining on her after an embrace, it meant that she accepted the wearer as a suitor. The clay could be obtained only in certain regions and was an important article of trade. Unburned wilgie was also used in decorating the body and other things. It was often put on the chest in alternating lines with burned wilgie. This was especially true for the dances when both kinds were put on the chests and shoulders of the par- ticipants. Every possible combination was found, such as three lines of one and one line of the other, two and two, or two and one. The women wore no ornaments for the dances but sat to one side, tended the fires, and sang. The headdresses for the dances were striking. Some consisted of a row of dog tails across the head and strips of fur down each cheek tied under the chin. Emu feathers were arranged similarly. Others were made of wild cat tails which attached to them on both sides small sticks bound with the pink and grey everlastings. Still others consisted of the wing and tail feathers of wild birds.</page><page sequence="18">696 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, The natives used to draw pictures in the sand with the finger or a pointed stick. One girl was particularly adept at this amusement: her perspective was fairly good, and she drew animals in their various attitudes with wonderful accuracy, seeming to catch the spirit of the pose. At scenery she was also good but she could not manage faces and figures. The girls of the tribe were delighted with her talent and we had many amusing drawing competitions - of the trees, rocks and animals, but no one could manage the house. Shading also was of the crudest. The girl who drew so well could tell when her pictures were wrong and often would rub out parts and rectify the errors, but she did not seem to be able to show the others just where they had made their mistakes» XV. Dances and Corrobborees. The natives performed many dances at their great parties. The men danced one sort of dance until they were tired. They then rested, had a talk, perhaps took some refreshment in the form of roast meat, and then started another dance. In some dances all of the men took part, in others there were often only a few performers. The very old men did not attempt to dance but helped the women with the fires, without which no meeting of any kind would have been considered complete. The old men, however, did not join the women in the singing. The following corrobboree was held to celebrate my return to the station with my first baby. This particular type was a celebration danced only on special occasions. A large party of men first arrived in a body, all keeping step. They were followed by the women. The men stood around in a large circle, and the women sat down in a half circle a little further away. The men had their hunting-spears and spear-throwers but no fighting spears or throwing-sticks. The women commenced by singing a low plaintive song, while the men kept time by stamping first one foot then the other and saying, "Ho, Ho". The song and the dance gradually became faster and faster until the men almost ran around each other in the circle. After the men had revolved until almost breathless, the women's song suddenly ceased and the dancers stopped. Then one man broke away and ran into the circle singing a song and brandishing his spear, which he had slipped into his spear-thrower. He danced around inside the circle and pointed his spear at every alternate man. Suddenly he stopped and the men shouted, "Hooh Hooh". Then another man did the same thing, but pointed his spear at the men who had not been pointed at before. When he finished there was another shout of "Hooh Hooh", followed by another mad dance around the circle. The women sang their song to accompany and when they had finished, the "Ho Ho" was taken up again by the men. Two men then ran into the circle to join the two standing in the middle. The four men ran around singing and pointing their spears as before. This procedure was repeated until a complete inner circle was formed. The inner circle then revolved in one direction and the outer circle in the other. The women continued to sing. The men danced. Suddenly there was a great</page><page sequence="19">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 697 shout 0/ "Ho Ho" and the large circle was farmed again, then broken into a march around as the women sang. The men next stood still and swung first one foot then the other, making the ground shake, and continually shook their spears. Of a sudden they started their "Ho Ho" again and rushed madely around in a circle. The women's song became wilder and louder, and the inner and outer circles were again formed. This procedure continued for nearly an hour until all sat down exhausted. The women then made little fires and soon the men were inside a circle of small fires. When this had been done the women commenced their song again. One man arose, danced about and sang a song, shaking his spear and telling what a fine fellow he was. When he finished, another man got up and did the same thing. One after another the men arose and went through the same procedure and this continued until they were presented with some refreshments and the baby brought forth. The men marched off to their camp, still singing their "Ho Ho". Over two hundred natives took part in this dance, which was seldom per- formed. Their headdresses were of every sort their ingenuity could conceive, all the birds and beasts having contributed to their adornment. The time kept was perfect. The instant the women's song was finished the men took up their shout, and when they stopped the women, without a pause, commenced their song again. When the men and women joined together, the shouting blended with the soprano notes of the women. The men kept excellent time to either the shouting or the singing. The following dance, of unknown significance, was performed in 1861 by a group of about two hundred natives. It was seen by Mr. Hassell and another white man, - the first Europeans these natives had ever met although they had heard of them. A circle was made with small fires and tended by the women, who sat outside and sang a low droning chant. The men stood around in a circle behind the women. Suddenly three men, or five men, always an uneven number, broke away from their circle, dashed between the women, leaped over the row of fires and stood facing each other. Two men faced one, or three woulcji face two, in almost the middle of the circle. After a few words each, with his arms across his chest, stood on one leg and made the muscles of the thigh and calf stand out and quiver. This seemed to be a question of endurance for they did nothing else. When they could stand it no longer they fell to the ground and remained there until other men entered the circle. They then got up and took seats just inside the fire circle. The men on the outside made no noise except a satisfied grunt when one contestant outlasted the others. This was kept up until all the dancers were inside the fire circle. After all the exhibitions and a short rest the other men on the outside of the circle dashed between the women and leaped over the fires. They embraced all the thigh dancers in turn and stepped around in circles of three and five, each party having one or two of the thigh dancers. In the meantime the women sang a song to accompany the dance. Suddenly the women raised</page><page sequence="20">698 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, their voices to almost a scream. The men immediately rushed out of the circle, kicked the fires to pieces and went off to their huts, The women then took small pieces of the firesticks with them and followed the men. This dance lasted between three and four hours. The kind of a dance performed by an individual or by a few performers is well illustrated by a dance executed by a native named Tooting. He started by running into a ring formed by men and sat down with a bough. He would arise and dance about, then suddenly sit down and try to cover his back with the bough. This was repeated several times. The natives were delighted; one by one the other men followed suit, rushing into the ring to emulate the original dance. The idea was to represent a large male kangaroo feeding on the plains and overtaken by a violent storm. He got under a tree not large enough to shelter his whole body, so that his tail got wet. When he attempted to shelter it, his head and feet got wet. He made matters worse by picking leaves from the tree to cover his feet and finally had to put his arms over his head. When the rain was over he shook himself and ran about to get dry. Throughout the pageant the women sang the following song, which was repeated over and over, the first two lines twice, then the next two twice, then all four by one woman, then all four by all the women: youngar baal bucai are barn baree fannie kipe are chanie bucai are waree youngar bucal nint kipe are chanie bucai are fannie cart maar kipe bucai are barn baree fannie Free translation: Large kangaroo with his back to a tree, Water running down his back, Large kangaroo with his tail by a tree, water running down it, Head and hands, water running down them. XVI. The Man Carl Ceremony. Every year the natives burned great tracts to make sure the grass would come up green and sweet with the first rains and to drive out the game for hunting purposes, All the young of the birds that build their nests on the ground were hatched and the young ground rats old enough to run about before these fires were made» When the time was held ripe for the bush fires (man carl) the man carl corrobboree was held. This dance was done at night. A little distance from the camp and near the river bed, which at this time of year was a dry white expanse of sand but would become a rushing torrent after the first rains, the natives had cleared four large circles of all grass and leaves and beaten the ground flat. In the centers of the circles were huge boughs and bushes, near which sit the girls waiting for the appearance of the men. As soon as the men appeared the girls jumped up, set fire to the heaps, and then retired to a small rise on the side of the ridge, where they were joined by the old women. The decorations of the men were not nearly so orna-</page><page sequence="21">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 699 mental as usual. Many of them had only a band of spun fur around their heads. Their totems were stuck in the bands as were also pieces of stick which had been shaved against the grain. The shavings were left upon the stick and curled so as to look like white and brown feathers. These ornaments were about six inches long. As soon as the men reached the bonfires the women began to chant, while the men separated into four parties and danced around the fire with their arms outspread. There were about a half dozen natives, who formed the con- necting link between each circle. The men danced around the fires and made a huge letter "S" in human figures, a circle at each end and two in the middle. After revolving until each party had gone around the fire of each circle, each man keeping time with a steady tramp to the chanting of the women, they suddenly set up a tremendous shout of „Hooh Haah", and everything stopped completely. The effect was most weird, the sudden silence being in distinct contrast to the constant droning chant of the women and the steady tramp of the men's feet. The men then collected in a group, and the women came down from the ridge with more branches, which they heaped upon the fires, All of the spears and curled (?) sticks belonging to the men at the top and bottom circles of the "S" were then piled in heaps, with the butts stuck in the ground and the barbed ends pointing upwards. One group placed their spears north of their fire, while the other groups planted theirs south of their fire. The men of the two middle circles did likewise, one party putting their curled (?) sticks to the north and the other placing theirs to the south of their respective fires. The women then sat down around the spears and struck up another and quicker chant. The men at the top and bottom of the "S" danced sideways toward their fire and the center men, each holding a spear in both hands, danced sideways in the opposite direction. After dancing several times as described, three men broke away from each center and formed a chain, which linked the circles of the "S". The dancers then revolved in quicker time until the men holding the spears were at the top and bottom of the "S". A terrific "Hooh Haah", repeated four times, then proclaimed the end of this movement and the men all lay down to rest. As soon as the men had finished their dance the women jumped up and dragged all the burning boughs away. They then seized green boughs and swept away all the particles of hot ash. When this had been finished they made numerous little fires in the large circle trampled down by the men's feet. All of this took about a half hour. The men now reformed and danced in circles within the large blazing ring. They were first armed with two hunting spears each, but when they formed the second figure of this dance each of them piled one spear to the north of each circle. The curled (?) sticks were not used in this dance. After dancing exactly the same inside the circle as they had before, they again came to a sudden stop. All the spears were then piled up, and the men seized their boomerangs, madly rushing in and out between the fires, driving one another backwards and forewards very much as they do when driving game. Every now and then a man would drop out and lie down near one of the heaps of</page><page sequence="22">700 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, spears. At last, after three hours of constant dancing, the performance ended for the night, to be resumed regularly for several nights. Finally the corrob- boree came to an end, and the next day the entire camp left for the bush to start their man carl in all directions. This activity continued until after the rains had commenced. This ceremony always took place at the end of summer. XVII. Tribal Battle. One of the most important causes of intertribal conflict was a wife's elopement with a member of another tribe. Very often when a husband became suspicious of his wife's intentions he speared her through the calves of the legs. When a wife ran away her action was considered an affront to the entire tribe with the result that tribal honor had to be vindicated. A yump, or letter stick with a battle challenge, was made and given to one of the men to take to the abductor's tribe. The messenger set forth and showed his stick to all members of his own tribe he might encounter. When he reached the hostile camp he hid until night. Then he took the yump in his left hand and a fighting spear in his right, hurled them together at the nearest fire of the camp, and ran for his life. The throwing of the spear indicated that the trouble was tribal whereas the yump alone would have signified a challenge only to those directly involved. A native camp preparing for battle was a beehive of industry. Even the children had duties to perform. The men had to burn wilgie for the body decorations, prepared new spear sticks, and attended to their other weapons. The women busied themselves chipping flakes of stone for the spears and kneading gum, for use in the manufacture of weapons. The new spears had to be greased and the old ones regreased, a duty which generally fell to the boys. Before a battle the women were usually depressed. The battle seldom occurred before a week of more of preparation. The tribes met at a designated point and the fight commenced as soon as the groups were within spearthrowing distance. The men were painted with wilgie and clay and each wore a noilyet or nose-bone, put in place the previous night by the mulgar. The tribes met amidst a great shouting. Each woman stood beside her husband and attempted to dash aside with her digging-stick the spears which came in his direction. The elder boys gathered the spears thrown and handed them to the men, who threw them back at the enemy. The men discarded their cloaks before entering battle so as to be unem- cumbered. Extra spears were carried in their belts, with the points projecting backwards to give their arms free play. As soon as a man's spears were gone he threw his throwing sticks at his opponents' legs and hurled his boomerangs at their thighs. Both of these weapons are capable of inflicting very severe wounds. During the fighting the scene was a perfect bedlam. The women kept up a shrill squeal, the men uttered frequent deep howls, and the children added to the din as best they were able, undoubtedly as much from fear as from the excitement of the battle. Even babies attended, clinging to their mothers while the latter were dashing the hostile missies to the ground.</page><page sequence="23">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 701 The battle raged until someone had been speared. Though the air was filled with spears, sticks and clubs, an hour often elapsed before anyone was hit. This speaks well for the agility of all the natives concerned, both men and women. As soon as one man had been speared, the battle ended, both sides retiring. The wounds inflicted by the throwing-sticks and boomerangs did not end a fight, no did the injuries received by the women and children. If the honor of the tribe was not vindicated by the tribal conflict, indi- vidual combat might take place. Sometimes this did not occur for a number of months or until the physical wounds had had time to heal. Á messenger was sent to arrange the combat. He wore his noilyet turned up and delivered his message to the mulgar of the enemy group. In one instance a girl named Yerriben had deserted her Wheelman hus- band named Donqup to elope with Cowran of the Quahip tribe. A tribal battle had been fought but its outcome had not been considered satisfactory by the Wheelman. After eight months had elapsed an individual fight was arranged. Dongup chose as a second a man from the neighboring Mongup tribe and Cowran selected as his second and individual from the Bremer Bay tribe. The four tribes then chose as referee a native from the Caractterup tribe, which was friendly to all. The fight took place at xWordecup, about half way between the boundaries of the opposing tribes. The Wheelman and Qualup were present in full force, but the other tribes were represented by only the individuals who were to take part, and a boy each to assist in the fight. Each second also had a woman to help in dashing the spears to the ground. The Mongup man was helped by Dongup's new wife and the Bremer Bay man was assisted by Yerriben, who was the cause of the whole affair. The combat was a repetition of the tribal conflict. The women knocked the spears aside, the boys picked them up and the men threw them and main- tained a continuous howl. Boomerangs and throwing-sticks were also thrown. At last the Mongup man was speared in the leg above the knee. The Caract- terup man then came forward, pulled the spear through the leg and called for wood ashes. Two men from each tribe brought a handful each, and the referee rubbed this on each side of the wound to stop the bleeding. Hunting-spears only were used in this fight. These make clean wounds. As the result of the fight Yerriben by right of conquest now belonged to Cowran, and Dongup gave up all claim to her. Cowran immediately asserted his authority in the presence of both tribes by spearing Yerriben through the calf of each leg. The two tribes then made friendship again and the medecine-men removed the nose- bones. A great hunt and feast followed and after two or three days the tribes returned to their own territories. XVIII. Evil Spirits. The natives believed in a number of evil spirits called jannock(s) who were concerned with the living and not the dead. There seem to have been no good spirits. Certain jannocA(s) were mischievous, but also evil. They often assumed the shapes of whirlwinds or puffs of wind and blew dust into your eyes to blind you; or they might go down your throat and cause you to choke</page><page sequence="24">702 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, and cough. Sometimes a number of them would band together, make a cloud of dust and sweep everything before them, filling up shallow water holes to cause a great deal of suffering to the natives. It was impossible to protect one- self by building a fire for they got into the ashes and scattered them about, often setting a hut on fire. Other jannock(s) came in the night to worry the nunghar(s), or natives, so that they could not sleep, and to make the children cry. On cold nights they stole the warmth from the fires and devoured any food which might be about. For these reasons the natives built a second fire for them and placed some food there so that the jannock(s) would find nourishment and warmth without bothering them. Jannock(s) very rarely made a noise but one could sense their presence when they were about. »Sometimes they were heard screaming in the wind in à big storm. That was when they were fighting, and all wise people kept very quiet for they knew that when a jannock screamed it was very angry and would not hesitate to commit any deed, regardless of how evil it might be. On the coast there were other jannock(s). Some lived in the sea and occasionally showed themselves in the form of water spouts. They were viewed with the greatest terror, for the meeting of the sea and the sky, except on the edge of the world, was regarded as a most unholy union which could bring nothing but misfortune to the unlucky witnesses. If a native saw the sea rising and the clouds lowering to meet it, he at once informed the tribe and they broke camp immediately to move as far inland as their boundaries would permit. They allowed a long time to elapse before they returned to that spot. Night travel was rare because of the fear of ¡annock(s). Noatch was regarded as the supreme evil spirit concerned primarily with departed beings. Noatch has neither sex nor shape but generally haunted the tribal burying-grounds waiting for the spirits of the dead to arise from the grave and start on their long journey to the far, far away country. Bluff Knoll, 3640 feet in altitude, the highest peak of the Stirling Ranges, was considered as Noatctfs headquarters and this region held an evil reputation among the natives. Their name for it was Bullah Meual or Great Many Face Hill, named after the peculiarity of the rocks, which in many instances have shapes like faces. This peak is often covered with mists which curl around the mountain tops and float into the gulleys, and these mists were believed to be the only visible form which Noatch could assume. Noatchy however, could not hold one shape for long and this explained why the mists were constantly changing in appearance. The country about Bluff Knoll is very barren and there is little game so the natives had no practical reasons for approaching it, a condition which undoubtedly added to its mysteriousness. Since Noatch lived in the mountains where there were mists and cold, two fires were always placed at a grave, a small one for the spirit of the departed, and a large one for Noatch who would stop to get warm and thus give the human spirit a chance to escape. The building of two fires was also made at every camp, but the second fire was for the jannock(s) who were concerned only with living people. Food is put by the jannock fire to attract their attention, and</page><page sequence="25">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 703 cause them to forget the natives. Often no more than the forepart of a kan- garoo's paw would be contributed. This has very little meat on it but was regarded as sufficient to appease the appetites of the jannock(s). Certain ¡annock(s) acted as the attendants of Noatch. Marghet was another spirit who lived in inland waters. Marghet was said to be a male who was very long and round. He had short feet, an immense head, a large mouth, and numerous teeth. He inhabited the deep lakes and pools and traveled at night. He was often heard but rarely seen. If a native went into a pool where Marghet was lurking he was seized by the legs and pulled under, never to be seen again. Sometimes on some of the larger lakes the water in the center boils and bubbles and big rings appear just as if some large animal was about to emerge. The natives maintained that this was caused by Marghet but he usually did not appear. The boiling and bubbling cease after a time and lake becomes quiet again. Marghet also made many strange noises at night. Noises were often heard in the bush which could not be explained but to the natives Marghet was responsible for them all. Sometimes these noises sound like an animal wallowing and grunting in the water, or like a lot of whips cracking, like a distant bell ringing, like a single report of a heavy rifle or like a fusilade of rifle fire. In aboriginal times these were believed to be the attempts of Marghet to drive away the intruders. Sometimes when Marghet was travelling he might go too far from water. He then sank into the ground and water cozed from him to make strange mounds of mud. These can be seen in a number of places. There is one group of three or four, separated from each other by only a few yards, in the center of a dry, rocky country about a mile from the bed of a river. Each mound is about four feet high, three or four feet wide at the top and six to seven feet in dia- meter at the base of the cone. They are made of soft, dark, orange-colored mud and each has a tiny spring bubbling out at the top. Some times these springs bubble and throw out lumps having a clay surface surrounding an interior of decomposed stone. These curious mud springs are wet even during the driest summers. Apparently Marghet must revisit them often to keep them. wet. Aside from drowning natives who ventured too far into the lakes, Marghet did not seem to do any particular harm although he did his best to frighten all intruders. Coombar Jannock was a gigantic male spirit who had once been a human being. His origin dates from the time of a great flood which made the natives retire to the top of a mountain. All the natives were huge people then but many of them drowned and the children died. After they reached the mountain top food was so scarce that the animals perished, the edible roots rotted in the ground from the excessive moisture, and as a consequence the people became smaller and thinner. Most of the few children born died and the survivors were puny. There was one native, however, who had lived on the mountain top and had lost his wives by drowning in the rising waters. There were no marriageable girls for him to take as wives and the babies who had been born and betrothed to him had always died. At last he left the tribe and went into the forest, where the spear sticks had grown into tall trees. There he lived alone.</page><page sequence="26">704 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, He was said to be very, very big and tall. His hair was long and white, and white hair covered his face in such a manner that only his nose and eyes were to be seen. He carried an immense dwark or throwing-stick and very long spears, and over his back he had a huge coot or bag. We wandered about day and night, never stopping to sleep. Should he find an unwary native who was seeking sticks for spears he seized him, put him in his bag, and that was the last that would ever be heard of him. According to some natives the victims were eaten; others believe they were killed in a rage because of their male sex, for Cootnbar Jannock had always been on the lookout for a wife. Women however, did not go into the forests for spear sticks with the result that he could catch only the men. This made him so angry that he killed them and threw their bodies into the thickets where they never would be found. He never did any harm outside of his particular provinces, the thick deep forests of the Mallee country. Should a native disappear and his body not be found, it was believed that Coombar Jannock had got him, hence his death would not be avenged by the murder of an alien native. Noatch always had a fine time chasing the spirit of a man killed by Coombar Jannock, for since the burial fires could not be made, there was no fire to attract Noatch from the dead man's spirit. Gnolum was another anthropomorphic spirit. He was very tall and thin and wore a long thin beard. He went completely naked except for the feathers of the mopoak, his totem, which he stuck all over his head. His eyes were very big and round and could see anywhere. On sunshiny days they could be seen peering through the tops of the trees. At night he could not be seen unless the moon was very bright, when his eyes could be discerned through the branches of the trees. He carried a long thin wand three times as tall as himself. He always carried it straight in front of him, holding it in position by twisting his arms and hands around it. As he moved he kicked the bottom end of it, which made a particular track which could be seen occasionally in the forest. Gnolum was concerned only with young boys. Usually he came to them when they were some distance from the camp and tried to entice them away by offers of Mungar tree roots. Spots where the ground rats had been at work were pointed out by the natives as the results of his digging for roots, and the tops of the shea oak trees which had been bitten off by cockatoos and parrots were ascribed to him getting bardie(s) with his very long wand. Should any boy be so foolish as to eat anything given him by Onolum he could not resist the command to follow him and was never heard of again. If he did not partake of the food but was coaxed away, he was able, once Gnolum's eyes were turned from him, to hide and later find his way back to camp. Gnolum, apparently, had no power over women and girls or grown men. They sometimes saw him but he never offered them food nor attempted in any way to coax them to follow him. Where he came from or where he went, no one knew nor had they any idea where he lived. He always appeared suddenly from the tree tops.</page><page sequence="27">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 705 XIX. Medicines and Magic. Disease was very rare although the boys, when they arrived at manhood, often contracted a kind of consumption, from which many never recovered. After the natives began to adopt European clothing there was a great increase in illness. Under aboriginal conditions the natives wore their cloaks with the furry side in during the winter months, which not only kept them warm but permitted the rain to run off the untanned skin. In the summer they reversed the cloaks and wore the cooler skin side next to the body. There was, there- fore, never any need to change. In acquiring European clothes they followed the custom of not changing their garments when wet, with the result that the clothes dried on them and they contracted severe colds. Their simple remedies were not efficient enough to cure these and deaths naturally became more and more frequent. The natives resorted to magic for many of their cures but they did have a few simple herbal remedies of which the following are examples. Wardie - a heliotrope geranium with a long, thickish root which smells like a parsnip. This plant was eaten sparingly as a laxative. Quinine or Macrozamia Palm - the fruit stem of this plant is about one foot long and near the base of the leaves there is a large seed pod about four to six inches in diameter which resembles a large pineapple. When the pod ripens the husk opens and a shiny deep red seed falls out. The seed is about two inches long, an inch and one half thick, and oblong in shape. When the seeds are first exposed they are poisonous and cause violent diarrhoea and vomiting if eaten. The natives gathered the seeds and buried them in great heaps three or four feet in the ground. They were left there from early summer to mid-winter, a period of from eight to nine months. When dug up at that time they were soft and resemble dates but taste like olives. For trading purposes the stones, which are poisonous, were removed and the fruit strung on rushes. The plant grows only in the interior and was traded to the coast. The interior of the husks resembles Capock and was used by the early settlers for pillows and mattresses. Red Gum Tree - 'the seeds were eaten for diarrhoea. When the seeds were not procu- rable the gum which oozes from these trees was used. The gum is of a dark red color, very gluid and never becomes hard. It drops in great quantities under the trees, and the leaves on the ground look as if they have been splashed with blood. It will not dissolve in water but can be melted by heat. When thinly spread on paper it is waterproof. Unnamed plant - used for coughs and colds. The plant grows as a creeper near the coast. It has very fine green leaves and small, soft, white flowers. The leaves and roots are sticky and, when soaked in water, are not unlike licorice. Bundles of dry twigs were carried in the women's bags. They were soaked in water for eight to ten hours. The liquid was drunk and caused a heave perspiration and a deep sleep. Snake and spider bites were treated by squeezing the wound and burning it out with firesticks. It is then rubbed with red-hot wood ashes. The natives had a deep regard for magic and magical processes. Most of their magic (mulga), however, seemed to be confined to stones. Any stone which differed from those about was immediately accepted as a magic stone. They were apparently not chosen for any particular kind of magic although there seemed to have been some rule which governed the purposes to which certain stones</page><page sequence="28">706 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, were put. Some stones were believed to be efficacious for men only, others for women only. One stone, which belonged to Waymen, was considered responsible for her child being a boy as she had wished; and it had cured Woyeinong, who had burned her hand with a fire bark. It failed completely, however, when tried by the medicine-man. A magical object which was not a stone was owned by Gimbuck. It con- sisted of a long piece of thickly spun fur mixed with human hair. With this object she claimed power to direct a storm or make rain fall when and where she desired. The strand was about three-quarters of a yard long and was kept coiled in a ring in her coot. Occasionally she coiled it in her hair. She would not divulge the mode of using it for fear of losing her power over it. This object was held in great esteem by the other members of the tribe. No young girl would touch it and even the old women did not like to have it exhibited. The rnedicine-man knew all about it and often had Gimbuck assist him in the rain-making ceremonies. Yilgar, another old woman, probably had one too, but she would never show it, nor even admit ownership. Most of the magic of the tribe was in the hands of the medicine-man, miagar, who was usually a very capable person as well as powerful because of his profession. A tribe always had to have a medicine-man so when one died a successor was imported from another branch of the tribe unless there had been two in the group. Every medicine-man had his collection of magic stones, booliah. Buckerup, the medicine-man imported from another branch of the tribe to replace the deceased Winmar, had a wonderful collection, which included many interesting mineral specimens. One stone was very puzzling: in size and shape it was like a goose egg but of a dark green color and very heavy. He also had some pieces of iron ore, which were cubes and looked like black dice without the spots. Others were black stones which looked like large shot. The rain stones were the most peculiar of all. There was one kind some- thing like a top but not pointed and about two inches in diameter. Both ends were alike and it was sharply beveled in the middle. The color was a brownish red and its surface was rough, like an uncut garnet. It would not break when put on an anvil and struck with a hammer, although a small flake was chipped off which looked more like common glass with a greenish hue than anything else. These stones were not common, only about a half dozen having been seen in this tribe, and were greatly prized as rain stones. When the transcontinental railway line was built, some of these curious stones were found on the Nullar- bor Plain. No one seems to know what they are but it has been suggested that they are a kind of cosmic glass which may have fallen as meteorites. Since these plains are limestone in formation and non-volcanic, these stones have been a puzzle much discussed by scientists. Some of the other stones were specifically for curing illness. Some were used to place curses upon members of the tribe or upon individuals or groups of other tribes. Others were utilized to make the game more plentiful, to stop the wind, to make the sun shine, or for many other purposes. Each stone had a specific use.</page><page sequence="29">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 707 The green copper stones were used to make the grass grow. The blue copper stone brought forth the sunshine. The egg-shapped stone was something special and had something to do with making the game abundant. The coot of a mulgar was different from the bags of the women in that the furry side was turned inside and the flesh side served as the outer surface of the bag. His bag was conspicuous, therefore, and identified him wherever he went. The bag, like its owner, was held in great reverence for an ordinary person would no more think of touching his coot than he would the mulgar himself. It would have been a brave natine, indeed, who would have dared to spear a medicine-man. It would have meant not only a curse upon him fore- ver, but also probably have resulted in the extermination of his branch of the tribe. Vengance would not have been satisfied with one death, for all of the murderer's kin would have to be killed in order that they might accompany the mulgar to the far-off land. The murderer's spirit would be given over to Noatch. Most of the medicine-men were old; middle-aged men generally not acquiring the position unless they succeeded some old man by good fortune. The medicine-men seemed to bully their fellow-tribesmen a great deal but did not have much to do with the women. When a mulgar died, his successor took the contents of his coot The bag itself was hung on the hut pole at the grave. Buckerup was a shrewd old fellow, who used to come often for a quiet chat. He never divulged where his copper stones came from but would turn the conversation by asking another question or by telling some totally irrevelant camp gossip. When he learned that the barometer accurately foretold the coming of rain, he would come in the morning and say, "Missus, make talk rain come"; if told that rain was due in a day or two he would immediately go down to his camp and get his rain stones out. To bring rain, Buckerup would stand at midday looking at the sun and show it his stones- Then he would make a humming noise like the very lòud buzzing of a bee. This would last for a quarter of an hour, during which time he would not move. Suddenly he would run behind some low bushes and hide, still keeping up the buzzing. This would continue all afternoon until sunset, when he would retire to his hut and have his supper. About midnight he would make his camp fire blaze brightly and stand over it, humming and buzzing for a short time. Then there would be complete silence. This procedure would continue for a number of days until the rain came, or at least a heavy dew. His work would then be finished and he would rest. While trying to make rain he worked very hard, both mentally and physically. To make the sun shine was a much simpler matter. The green or grass stones and the blue or sky stones, along with some reddish stones, would be set in a row in front of the hut and left there until it stopped raining. The cubic stones and the round black ones had something to do with sickness and there were many others, the uses of which he would not reveal. Some stones were for men only. They had no connection with women, who were not allowed to know anything about them. One stone, an irregular piece of white quartz in which Anthropos XXXI. 1936. 4</page><page sequence="30">708 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, were two tiny specks of gold, had something to do with making the women bear children. It was carefully wrapped in bark and wound round with kangaroo sinews. It was carried in a woman's coot from full moon to full moon, then returned to the medicine-man, who then pronounced some magic words over the women. He had the reputation of causing complete success. XX. Death Ceremonies. The natives disliked to handle a dead body but since it was more impor- tant that everyone be buried at the tribal burying grounds they sometimes had to carry the dead for many miles. They therefore attempted to bring the ill back to camp before death occurred. The death of Win mar was attended with great ceremony. Winmar was the old medicine-man, hence a very important member of the group. After a trip in the bush in bad weather he had arrived home with a very bad cold. He barked all night like a twert (wild dog) and in the morning was unable to take an interest in anything, not even the beautiful new rainstone which Oimbuck had found for him. Gimbuck also had another stone, a very good stone, which was pretty, having a number of colors in it, and round like the eye of a sheep. Oimbuck regarded it as great magic so it was put in Winmar's mouth, but it did his bark no good. They then placed it on his stomach under his belt, but still he barked. The next day he was no better, so two men sat on his chest, back to back, and a third blew ashes in his face to drive away the twert. The poor old fellow lingered on for about a week, then one bitter cold, frosty night a great wailing commenced at the native camp and it was obvious that he was dying. The wailing was done by his wives, who beseeched the jannock to spare him. The following morning all the women joined in the wailing, which was most weird and mournful. Winmar was dead. Before long everyone went to the burying-ground to dig the grave, leaving the body to be guarded by only a few of the oldest men and women. They returned about midday for the body. The remains were taken out of the mia and placed upon a litter of boughs and twisted leaves. This was carried to the grave by the men who surrounded it, while the wome and children followed in a disorderly crowd, wailing in the course of the mile walk to the burying-ground. At the burying-ground a hut had been built and in front of it they had dug a shallow grave in the loose, sandy soil. The grave was curved almost in a cresent shape and a few boughs had been laid in it. The litter was laid down near the grave, and a man came forward with his throwing-stick and broke the arm, leg and thigh-bones. The knees were then drawn up under the chin, and the body laid on its right side. The litter was placed in the grave with the face toward the rising sun. Leaves were placed over the body and then the earth was thrown on until it was covered. On top of the grave leaves were placed in a heap. Immediately after the covering of the body the women, who had been con- tinuously wailing, brought out their firesticks and lighted two fires which had been prepared, one near the grave, the other some yards away. After this the bone-breaker, who had not assisted in covering the body, took the dead man's</page><page sequence="31">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 709 spears, broke each of them across his knee, and placed them near the feet. The spear-thrower, boomerang, axe, and knife were place near them. A small bag with his magic stones and other things was hung near his feet and a piece of meat and a piece of bark with water in it were placed near each fire. As soon as this ceremony was over, four men squatted on their haunches just in front of the crescent, with their backs to the grave. One was near the head at the end of the crescent, one near the feet at the other end of the crescent, and the other two were in the middle, all the men being in a straight line. An old woman then took a small lighted stick from each fire, blew out the flames, and placed them in a line, with their glowing ends about three inches apart, near the two middle men. The man at the head of the grave now gave a loud call, which was followed by an impressive silence lasting about three minutes. He then gave a longer and louder call and, after a pause, a third call, still longer and louder. There followed a silence of about five minutes. The second man then took up the calls. He called four times, the silence after each call in- creasing in duration. The third man them called five times, the pauses being still longer than before. The fourth man followed by calling six times, and again the intervals increased. After his last call there was perfect silence for at least ten minutes. The old woman who had taken the sticks from the death fires now took up the calling. She called three times with longer pauses than the men, and her calls ended in shrill screams. There was then dead silence again for another period of ten minutes. This was ended by the limb-breaker's taking the two fire-sticks and grounding their burned ends in the soft earth. He then buried them where they were and announced, just before he touched them, Keen Yenna, which means "There is no one". This implied that there were no evil spirits about, since there had been no answers to their calls. Had either of the glowing sticks burst into flame and the flame subsequently jumped across to the other it would have been proof that a jannock was near. After the sticks had been buried the four men joined the rest, as did the women. The man who buried the sticks took his own axe and made several notches on the bark of the two trees near the grave. When this had been done, the women set up a great wail and ran away from the place, the men following slowly. The graveyard was in a place which had many large trees. Each grave was marked according to the age and sex of the dead. A woman's grave was marked by her cloak and bag at the foot and her unbroken digging-stick stuck in the ground at her head. An uneven number of notches were cut in the trees nearby the women's graves and an even number were cut on the trees near the graves of the men. The graves of young girls were marked by their small cloaks and bags, while for the young boys a boomerang or two were placed at the foot. For a baby a small hut was built. Near every grave were the remains of two fires and some bark. After a death the women carried everything portable away and buiSt a new camp a few hundred yards away. At sunset the old camp was burned. For a period of four weeks the women wailed and marched every evening to 4*</page><page sequence="32">710 Ethel Hassell, selected and edited by D. S. Davidson, Winmar's grave. A fresh fire was started each time, the new one always a little farther away than the preceeding one. According to the natives, one fire was built for the deceased, the other for the evil spirits who had caused the death and were hovering about. Food and water were placed near the grave for the use of the dead when he awoke, after he slept until well again. The bones were broken to drive the evil spirits out of the body and to prevent the dead from jumping about until after the bones had knitted together, thus ensuring him of a long rest. The spears were broken on the theory that when he finally felt himself again he would awake, eat his food and drink his water, warm himself by the fire, reach out for his spears and, finding them broken, start out for a far-away land to find new ones. The other things were pladed near by so that he could take them with him, also lest he be vexed by thinking that someone else had his possessions. Food and drink were placed by the second fire so that the evil spirits would not steal the food and water of the deceased. Since the evil spirits would linger nearby, the fires were made further and further away to entice them away from the grave, and thus give the dead man a chance to escape when he finally awoke. The camp site was changed and the old huts kindled in order to* drive away the evil spirit in case it remained by the camp to cause the death of other people. After a person's death the natives would not mention his name, at least for a considerable time. Winmar was referred to as "the last mitigar". The orientation of the graves differs between the Hill tribes and the Plains tribes. The former dug the grave north and south, and placed the body on its right side with head to the south and face toward the rising sun. The earth was formed into a half-moon shape on the western side of the grave. This burial service was called goilit. The Plains tribes dug the grave east and west and laid the body on its back with the head to the east and the face turned on one side so that it looked toward the setting sun but also saw the sun at noon. The earth was thrown into two small heaps, one at the head, the other at the foot, with a decided hollow at the center, but the half moon shape was preserved. This was called yuar. Winmar was survived by two widows, Yilgar, an old woman, and Tupín, a young one. With the passing of their husband the prestige they had had as the mulgar's wives disappeared. For a time they dwelt alone in a small hut, a couple of hundred yards below the camp. Several women of the tribe went into mourning with plain white clay on their heads, but Tupín and her mother and Winmar's sister covered their heads with clay mixed with blood. This was put on in a thick plaster and looked like a skull cap. Across the foreheads of the widows three lines of the same white clay were placed and a thicker line was drawn from the corner of each eye to curve around the bottom of the cheek bones and end at the top of the ear. At the end of the month Tupín was married to Punqin, the principal in the burial ceremonies and Winmar's next of kin. Yilgar seemed to feel Winmar's death very much. They had been about the same age and had known each other all their lives. Yilgar refused to be consoled by the thought that when</page><page sequence="33">Notes on the Ethnology of the Wheelman Tribe of Southwestern Australia. 711 she died and "jumped up again" and reached the far away land she might find Winmar. She shook her head and sadly and said, "It is a far away country and a very big country, most likely I lose him". The Wheelman, as well as other tribes, have the peculiar custom of demanding the death of someone to accompany the one who had died to the sun, the iar away land of the departed. The sun was said to be not hot, heat being considered a property of the air which is between it and the earth. They preferred to kill someone from another tribe and selected a woman to accom- pany a dead man and a man to accompany a dead woman. As soon as a death occurred the members of the tribe immediately sought an unprotected band of natives from whom they might take a victim. Following the death of the medicine- man, a mysterious message stick or yump arrived and this may have carried in- formation as to where a victim might be found. The natives went away shortly after its arrival but upon their return would not reveal where they had been or what they had done. In the case of the death of Yuillen, who died of a poisonous spider bite, there apparently was no retaliation.</page></plain_text>
