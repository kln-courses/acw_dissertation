<plain_text><page sequence="1">Necrophilia in Portuguese Poetry: from the Eighteenth Century to the Present ALFREDO MARGARIDO (translated by T. F. Earle) The following reflections on the symbolic importance of necrophilia in Portuguese poetry from the eighteenth century to the twentieth were sug- gested by accounts of certain social customs of the Portuguese, whether living in their own country or as emigrants abroad. Portuguese emigrants tend to go home, even after death. Indeed, a considerable number of them cannot conceive of the afterlife except in terms of a return, not just to Portugal, but to their native villages. Their marked ethnocentricity reveals a curious view of death, which cannot be separated from a particular spot, nor from relations of kinship and neighbourhood: in the next world one has to cohabit with relatives, neighbours, friends and even enemies. The Portuguese taste in clothes is also very revealing. Black has tradi- tionally been a favourite colour and even today Portuguese women can be found, at home or abroad, completely dressed in black, from headscarf to shoes. In parts of Beira and Trás-os-Montes shawls like a chador are worn, and black makes visible the burden of mortality.1 These two non-literary observations provide a starting point for a study of the literature, which can never be cut off from the popular imagination. Although Jungian terminology will not be used in this study one cannot disregard the effect on individuals of collective practices, and in my view Portuguese literature cannot be considered in isolation from the underlying necrophilia of Portuguese society. These traits are not, of course, unique to the Portuguese, just as necro- philia itself is not alien to the romantic sensibility in general. One need only recall the existence of the 'graveyard school of poetry', which enjoyed a considerable vogue in eighteenth-century England and was a widespread phenomenon in European literature of the latter part of that century. By concentrating on the specifically Portuguese manifestation of necrophiliac literature, however, I am attempting both to pinpoint the particular and to illustrate an approach which could be applied to other societies and literatures. For the sake of brevity I shall give only two examples of the deep roots of necrophilia in Portuguese culture. One is the relationship between Pedro and 1 For an example of black clothing in necrophiliac poetry see Antonio Feijó, 'Exilado', in Poesías Completas, second edition (Lisbon, undated), p. 161.</page><page sequence="2">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY IOI Ines, incorporated by Camöes into his epic, where he focuses on the conditions under which she was crowned. The line 'A mísera e mesquinha que depois de morta foi rainha' suggests that necrophilia is firmly rooted in the Portuguese tradition, since this is probably the first and only instance in European political history of a coronation post mortem. The symbolism of that act did not disappear from Portuguese cultural practice; it emerged in a new form in the Sebastianist myth, centred as it is on a monarch who is dead and has vanished. There are, of course, differences between the two instances: in one a corpse is crowned, in the other it is the lack of a corpse which arouses the messianic impulses of the Portuguese, but both are manifestations of necrophilia. Attention should be drawn to the asymmetry of these two necrophiliac political expressions. In one, there is a witness to royalty in the magnificent tomb which contains the lovers who hope to meet again at the world's end after the interval of death; in the other, the very lack of a tomb permits the transformation of the king into a Messiah, guarantor of the nation's political continuity in a remote future. Another example of traditional necrophilia is provided by the accounts of shipwrecks, which were originally oral but later written down. These were particularly disastrous in the Indian Ocean and on the coast of East Africa. One of the best-known accounts concerns the loss of the great galleon S.Joäo, which went down with its cargo of gold, leaving its captain Manuel de Sousa Sepulveda and his noble wife Dona Leonor de Sousa Coutinho to seek shelter on the African shore. Dona Leonor, stripped naked by the native inhabitants, made arrangements for her own death, burying herself on the sandy beach 'coberta toda com os seus cábelos, que eram compridos'. In this episode we find literary evidence of the importance of women's hair in connection with death, a theme which greatly preoccupied the poets of the period with which I am concerned here. It is important to recall the popularity of these stories of violent and inescapable death by land and sea. Their relatively early appearance and wide diffusion in popular literature bear witness to the importance of literary necrophilia in the Portuguese tradition. There is, then, a case for an inventory of necrophilia in Portuguese literature, and especially in poetry, but the present survey will only include writers from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth, from Bocage, born in 1765, to José Duro, born a century later. The most recent work to be discussed, however, is from Camilo Pessanha's Clepsidra which was published in 1920. Before proceeding, I must establish the theoretical parameters of necro- philia. In his essay The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness, Erich Fromm defines this type of behaviour under five headings, of which only those relevant to the present study are given here. They are: (1) acts of sexual</page><page sequence="3">IO2 ALFREDO MARGARIDO contact with a female corpse (intercourse, manipulation of sexual organs); (3 ) attraction to corpses and graves and to objects connected with the grave, such as flowers or pictures; and (5) the craving to touch or to smell the odour of corpses or anything putrid. Fromm goes on to state that necrophilia in the characterological sense can be described as the passionate attraction to all that is dead, decayed, putrid, sickly; it is the passion to transform that which is alive into something unalive: ... it is the passion to tear apart living structures.2 The definition is a broad one, but it makes it possible to characterize poetic texts about corpses, graveyards, and the destruction of living forms, as in the instance of the burial and coronation of Ines de Castro. In the literary examples mentioned it is not difficult to recognize situations which have become classics of psychoanalytical or psychiatric practice. A fascination with cemeteries can be found in the poetry of Bocage. I have chosen as an example the famous and much anthologized sonnet 'Ditando para a Campa', in which there is much emphasis on the appurtenances of tombs and the link between the poet, a frequenter of graveyards, and his future corpse. The sonnet is also important because it uses the poet's love for Armia ('foi de Armia amador, de Armia amada') to stress the indissoluble link between Eros and Thanatos: À terra mäo piadosa me transporte, £ depois que um sepulcro mal composto Der ao frío cadáver frío encostó, Estes versos por dó na pedra corte.3 The tautology 'frió cadáver' is also found in Joäo Penha and Cesário Verde. But Bocage's main purpose in this epitaph-poem is to remind visitors to graveyards (themselves examples of a collective necrophilia) that the dead poet was a victim of love. He requires spectators, or readers, since cemeter- ies, and especially tombstones, are the ideal medium for the messages of the dead, who thus give posthumous vein to their preferences and whims. This sonnet, in which Bocage establishes his position in the community of the dead, serves as an introduction to another of his sonnets whose necro- philia is even more evident, since it is about the poet's possible future relationship, in the next world, with the woman who had made his life a misery in this one. Bocage here inverts the relationship of Pedro and Ines, which had by then become a commonplace of Portuguese literary myth- ology. In this sonnet, 'O Ciúme Reinando Ainda no Sepulcro', he foresees the encounter between his ashes and those of his ungrateful lover: Se ñas garras também da turva morte Conhecer que a ventura é doce engaño; 2 Erich Fromm, The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness (London, 1977), pp. 434, 441. 3 Bocage, Poestas Selectas, edited by Augusto C. Pires de Lima (Oporto, 1944), p. 78.</page><page sequence="4">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY IO3 Se o seu despojo enfim se unir contigo, Para que nem, ó triste, a paz possuas Entre ás eternas sombras do jazigo; Zelosas despertando, as cinzas tuas, Révoltas pelo horror, pelo odio antigo, Häo-de em negro montäo fugir das suas.4 Bocage here envisages a conscious life after death. In this sonnet there is a glimpse of the idyll of Pedro and Ines seen through the eyes of a jealous lover, a variation showing the capacity of Portuguese literature to transform the traditional theme. The most necrophiliac poem of Portuguese literature of the last century is Soares de Passos's 'Noivado do Sepulcro' whose musical nature is indicated by its characterization as a 'balada'. Like Bocage, Soares de Passos evokes a cemetery, but the first two stanzas, which describe the scene from the point of view of the poet-voyeur, introduce a number of other significant elements: Vai alta a lua! na mansäo da morte Já meia-noite com vagar soou; Que paz tranquila! dos vaivens da sorte Só tem descanso quem ali baixou. Que paz tranquila! . . . mas, eis, ao longe Funérea campa com fragor rangeu; Branco fantasma, semelhando um monge, De entre os sepulcros a cabeça ergueu. The poem evokes the traditional gothic associations with the dead: a full moon, proper to ghosts and werewolves, at midnight, the start of the second half of the night, that vague period which is the domain of the spirits and powers of the afterlife. The ghost that emerges from the grave to disturb the apparent peace of the cemetery complains that his beloved, whom he apostrophizes, has not come to him in the three days since his death. The world of the dead is thus summoning the world of the living. But the reply comes from another grave: Oh vem: eu nunca te cingi ao peito, Hoje o sepulcro nos reúne, enfim ... Quero o repouso do teu frío leito, Quero-te unido para sempre a mim! Thus his beloved has followed him in death and their sexual passion is at last consummated. The poem is discreet as to the way this singular union was celebrated, because we learn no more than that 'junto ao cruzeiro, sepulcral mistério/Foi celebrado, de infeliz amor'. The solution to the mystery only comes years afterwards: 4 Poesías Selectas, p. 82.</page><page sequence="5">IO4 ALFREDO MARGARIDO Porém, mais tarde, quando foi volvido Das sepulturas o gelado pó, Dois esqueletos, um ao outro unido, Foram adiados num sepulcro só.5 The obvious necrophiliac element in this poem is given a startling twist by the misunderstanding that gives rise to the consummation: the dead lover thinks his beloved is alive and faithless but the beloved has died in order to fulfil her vows. Soares dos Passos's poem, first published in 1856, became extraordinarily popular. It continues the classic literary tradition of the story of Pedro and Ines, but it is also bound up with popular death rites, like the 'encomendaçâo das almas', practised until recently in the north of the country, and reve- latory of the importance of the dead in the life of rural communities.6 The poem was handed down, endlessly sung and recited in the drawing-rooms of the middle class, in the primary schools and in the liceus, a popularity which suggests the commonplace nature of necrophiliac sensibility in Portuguese society. Joäo Penha (1839- 19 19) gave the topos a new basis, though he did not have Soares dos Passos's intense romanticism. In the sequence of sonnets entitled 'Vinho e Fel', which appeared in the first part of his Rimas, published in 1882, Joäo Penha suggests that the ideal resolution of his relationship with his beloved could only occur after death: Mas ao menos no fúnebre jazigo, Dá-me, em desconto do meu fado avesso, Que eu fique em mármore a dormir contigo.7 The tercet presents a suggestive ambiguity: does 'dormir contigo' have a sexual meaning, or should we see, in the reference to marble, a replica of the situation of Pedro and Ines in Alcobaca? The function of stone would seem to be to preserve the situation for all eternity, removing it from the world of the flesh, in which death and putrefaction are inevitable. Joäo Penha's treatment of the topos would seem to avoid the crudity implicit in Soares dos Passos, who had not hesitated to suggest (albeit metaphorically) the possibility of a physical relationship after death. The lovers of the 'Noivado do Sepulcro' had been dead for three days, and the process of decomposition would already have begun, a fact which stresses the crude physicality underlying Soares dos Passos's phantasmagoria.8 On the evidence of some of his verses, one might suppose that Gomes Leal (1848-1921) and Guerra Junqueiro (1850-1923), both influenced by 5 A. A. Soares dos Passos, Poesías (Oporto, 1 875). 'O Escravo' is another necrophiliac poem by the same author. 6 Torge Dias and Margot Dias, A Encomendaçâo das Almas (Oporto, undated). 7 ïoâo Penha, Rimas (Lisbon, 1882-83), Sonnet 22. 8 Erich Fromm, The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness, p. 436.</page><page sequence="6">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY IO5 Positivism and by Lavoisier, had resisted the fashionable necrophilia of Portuguese poetry. Gomes Leal stands necrophilia on its head by stating Tudo o que existe ou foi, morre para nascer'9 and Guerra Junqueiro says virtually the same thing, in more staccato language: 'Morrer! Que serve! A morte é o prólogo da vida!' In both cases, death is seen as superior to life, which becomes merely a period of transition. However, neither of these writers was entirely immune from necrophiliac romanticism. Guerra Junqueiro uses the idea of time as the lover who takes physical possession after death: A ti que vais beijar os tristes namorados, Quando, insensíveis já, seus corpos verminados Jazem na podridäo da velha noite escura.10 There is no ellipsis here to imply the possibility of a physical relationship between the lovers after death, though the poem describes what was apparently normal behaviour - the burial of lovers in the same tomb, or side by side. (This seems poor compensation for unconsummated love.) And what stands out in the poem is the vigour of the language that clearly denies even the possibility of a physical relationship: the tristes namorados' have become 'corpos verminosos' and consequently 'jazem na podridäo da noite escura', a metaphorical night which stresses the absence, in death, of any kind of light, even moonlight. There is a shift from the psychological to the physiological, with stress on the harshness of the biological facts. Though there is not a complete break with the world of Soares dos Passos or Joäo Penha, the poem suggests a possible reorientation, which was only fully realized in Portuguese poetry after Camilo Pessanha. Cesário Verde (1855- 1886) and Gomes Leal tackled the topos, by convergent routes, within a few months of each other. In his poetry of 1874-75, as well as in 'Nos', of 1884, Cesário made particularly heavy use of a vocabulary laden with references to death and graveyards. Not all the relevant poems can be discussed here. One which is particularly revealing, however, is 'Responso', of 1874. ^n this poem Cesário's reverie about the femme fatale narrows the gap between the real and the impossible: Num castelo deserto e solitàrio, Toda de preto às horas silenciosas, Envolve-se ñas pregas dum sudario E chora como as grandes criminosas. It is a curious situation, doubly necrophiliac: the woman is all in black, and consequently in mourning, but at the same time wraps herself in the 9 Gomes Leal, *A Bela Flor Azul', in Claridades do Sul (Lisbon, 1901), p. 28. x" uuerra junqueiro, A. Morte ae u.joao (Lisbon, 1944;, p. 210.

The supposedly opposed colours of black and white here both refer to death. In stanzas xi and xn Cesário, normally very distant from the woman of his erotic imaginings, aspires to a kind of funereal contact with her: Unissemos, nos dois, as nossas covas, Ó doce castelä das minhas trovas!11 The poet desires not a living woman, but one on the point of death, and death's inevitability excites him further. Such a situation is entirely necro- philiac: the poet accumulates around the figure of the beloved the signs of death, which stimulate his eroticism, though they do not satisfy it. There is a clear family resemblance with the poem of Soares dos Passos, though there is an evident difference between the desire for a relationship in the tomb and the consummation ofthat relationship. Cesário introduces a poetic mediator between desire and satisfaction. But 'Responso' is not the only poem in Cesário's brief production to have a necrophiliac dimension. In two poems of 1875 there are undoubtedly elements which are both fetishistic and necrophiliac. In 'Milady' Cesário identifies that specimen of British womanhood with death itself: £ é, na graça distinta do seu porte, Como a Moda supèrflua e feminina, E täo alta e serena corno a Morte! In the visual delirium of this poem the youthful 'milady', thus identified with death, is pursued by the poet through the streets of Lisbon, which becomes a sinister necropolis. In the second half of the poem, Cesário seems to give his approval to a violence made possible by the 'povos humilhados', who 'pela noite,/Para a vingança aguçam os punhais'. The fact is that the poet's need to humiliate the proud woman is an attempt to compensate for his own sense of inferiority in a situation in which he feels overwhelmed by death, seen as equivalent to the Englishwoman's violently destructive glance. The same woman reappears in the equally delirious 'Frígida'. Visual and tactile elements are associated: the 'gélida mulher bizarramente estranha' moves with the 'marcha demorada e muda dum fantasma'. Both elements contribute to the delirium, which Cesário develops as follows: E, ao persegui-la, penso acompanhar de longe O sossegado espectro angélico da Morte! The irony of these lines reminds the reader of the techniques of poetic mediation used by Joäo Penha and Gomes Leal. It disguises, but does not diminish the serious purpose of the poetic delirium. 11 Cesano Verde, Obra Completa (Lisbon, 1964), p. 49.</page><page sequence="8">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY IO7 In other poems Cesário's fetishism and necrophilia transform the city, or at any rate, the part of it previously bustling with activity, into a mausoleum. One instance can be found in the section of 'O Sentimento dum OcidentaP (1880) entitled 'Ao Gas': Mas tudo cansa! Apagam-se ñas frentes Os candelabros, como estrelas, pouco a pouco; Da solidäo regouga um cauteleiro rouco; Tornam-se mausoléus as armaçoes fulgentes. It could be said that Cesário is even more necrophiliac than Soares dos Passos since he transforms a whole district of Lisbon into a charnelhouse. By doing so, he eliminates the human, and instead peoples Lisbon with sym- bolic corpses. It becomes a sombre place of absolute darkness and conse- quently anti-human, a place where only the fantastic figures of the other world are present. It is possible that Cesário is here taking up a position in the face of death on behalf of his family, since the poet and his brothers and sisters were already threatened with early extinction. In Gomes Leal the necrophiliac theme is present in a poem included in his Claridades do Sul of 1875 which reveals the influence of Soares dos Passos, combined with that of Cesário : Pudesse ir eu, contigo, que me encantas Como um vinho, no pò da terra dura, Dormir ambos na mesma sepultura, Entre os bracos das ervas e das plantas! . . . Dormir no mesmo leito, e a mesma cova Sentir os nossos pálidos abraços, De noite quando, branca nos espaços, Ñas ervas desmaiasse a lúa nova. There are differences, of course. But there are similarities of attitude, too, as can be seen from a comparison between the first line quoted and the lines from Cesário's 'Responso': 'Pudesse eu ir também sonhar contigo | E ter | as mesmas pedras no jazigo!' (stanza xi). Perhaps Gomes Leal was the origi- nator, though the present state of bibliographical knowledge makes it impossible to state this categorically.12 Whatever the case, there is a considerable similarity of attitude. Cesário's wish, 'Uriissemos, nos dois, as nossas covas', finds an exact parallel in Gomes Leal's line 'Dormir no mesmo leito, e a mesma cova'. But there are evident differences too. In Gomes Leal there is a dionysiac element, which reappears later in Camilo Pessanha: the enchantment of the beloved is 'como um vinho'. However, this dionysiac exultation, the result of success in love, can only occur- in the tomb shared by the lovers. The necrophiliac element 12 There is a useful bibliography, though now out of date, in Vitorino Nemesio, Destino de Gomes Leal (Lisbon, undated).</page><page sequence="9">IO8 ALFREDO MARGARIDO became much more important for Gomes Leal in A Mulher de Luto of 1902, where it is combined with a belief in the immortality and transmigration of souls. I shall return to Gomes Leal later in this study. José Duro, who, like Cesário, was a victim of tuberculosis, also made use of the necrophiliac structures we have been illustrating: Apraz-me o simbolismo ingénito das coisas . . . E aos labios da Mulher, a desfazer-se em beijos, Prefiro os labios maus das negregadas loisas, Abrindo num ansiar de mórbidos desejos.13 It would be hard to find a poem with so marked a dual brutality: there is a rejection of human relationships, particularly those marked by the tenderness (erotic or simply affectionate) of women, and a preference for a typically dark-hued necrophilia. Not only are the slabs of the tomb black, the colour of death and mourning, but they are also 'negregadas', ill- omened. Duro's use of the word can be understood as a reference to his own physical decline - a novel use of necrophiliac imagery. Cesário, when writing about his family, saw decline from the outside; Duro sees himself, in poetic terms, from within. 'Dilui-se-me o pulmäo e sai-me pela guela', he says, the destruction of his lungs being linked to the decline of his powers of imagination: 'Já sinto emurchecer no crànio a flor do Sonho'. This decline is the inevitable harbinger of death: 'E oiço a Morte bater, sinistra, à minha porta . . .' The character at once destructive and lubricious of the poem is made clear in the fourth line quoted, in which Duro anthropomorphizes the tomb. The stones become 'labios maus', and are thus opposed to women's lips, Thanatos opposed to Eros. The cemetery is not a place of repose, nor the scene of the couplings of the dead: the poet, like the other corpses, is there to be eaten. The stanza, which is revelatory of the poet's sexual frustration, makes the poem one of the most brutal manifestations of necrophilia in Portuguese poetry. The title of the collection - Fel - reveals the specific nature of Duro's necrophiliac tendencies. The physiological term had already appeared as the oxymoronic title - Vinho e Fel - of part of the first book of Joäo Penha's Rimas. José Duro eliminates the dionysiac element, isolating bile, a word of anatomical connotations but with the figurative element too of bad temper, hatred, bitterness. There is something of the dionysiac still in Penha, but Duro sees death as something exclusively harsh and destructive. The innova- tive element in Duro is, however, the stress he lays on his own ego, from whose delirium in the face of death other figures - the woman, the loved one, the object of desire - largely disappear. 13 Tose Duro, 'Doente', in As Mais Belas Líricas Portuguesas, edited by José Règio (Lisbon, undated), p. 32.</page><page sequence="10">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY IO9 In the poetry of Antonio Nobre, too, the least sound or movement is taken as a sign of the poet's own death. There is an example in 'Os Males de Anto': Urn berço que dormia era urn caixâo pra cova! E, ao ver meadas de linho a corarem, ao Sol, Pensava ... se estaría, ali, o meu lençol . . . E o que eu cismava ao ver passar os carpinteiros Cantando alegres e fumando, galhofeiros, A tiracolo a serra, o martelo e o formäo . . . Vinham, quem sabe! de acabar o meu caixäo! Deitava-me no chao de ventre para o Ar, Cismava: se morrer, é assim que hei-de ficar . . ,14 In Cesário's 'Nos', baptisms and funerals are juxtaposed: 'Pela manhä, em vez dos trens dos baptizados, | Rodavam sem cessar as seges dos enterros.'15 In Nobre the metamorphosis of eradle into coffin is condensed in a single line from which all breath of life is excluded: society is necrotized. In this section of the poem visual metaphors predominate, sight being here the dominant sense. The skeins of linen are transformed into shrouds, while the passing carpenters permit another metamorphosis: they are cheerful, like Cesário's women dockers, although dehumanized in the necrophiliac vision into mere instruments for making the poet's imagined coffin. The passage ends with an extraordinary situation in which the poet visualizes his own death, lying on the ground 'de ventre para o Ar'. The poet's imagination has lost its links with life, to associate itself ever more closely with death. The poem's pathological and narcissistic qualities are revealed in so far as the poet's own death, not someone else's, becomes a spectacle for himself to watch. There are analogous elements in some of the poems already discussed, but none so extreme. Nobre's use of traditional motifs is thus formally and thematically novel. But Portuguese literature was not yet rid of lovers in the tomb. They maintain their vitality, if I may be permitted the paradox. Every reader who has been through the Portuguese secondary education system will know the famous sonnet by Antonio Feijó, whose beginning is a paradigm of the genre we are considering: Morreu. Deitada no caixâo estreito, Pálida e loira, muito loira e fria. Two poems by Feijó, both from Ilha dos Amores of 1897, deserve special mention. 'Pálida e Loira' is one of them, a poem in which death is not associated with black, but with blond angels with blue eyes. A feature of 14 Antonio Nobre, Só (Oporto, 1950), p. 201. In two poems published in Líricas e Bucólicas (1884), Antonio Feijó malees use of the same necrophiliac topos about carpenters. In the case of Tragèdia Simples' the source is stated to be Hartzenbusch; in that of 'Lieder', it is Heine. It is reasonable to assume that both Portuguese poets made use of German material. 13 tesano Verde, Dora Compieta, p. 121.</page><page sequence="11">IIO ALFREDO MARGARIDO Feijó's verse is his exultation of erotic (albeit non-physical) relations after death: Era estreito o caixâo, muito estreito . . . que importa? Se os meus sonhos levava enlaçados na morta, Mottos uns de volúpia, outros de sofrimento!16 The stanza is certainly ambiguous, in that the third line suggests what may be a sado-masochistic relationship. Such a reading is justified by the evidence of a number of poems in which Feijó makes clear his view of the importance of flagellation at die hands of the loved one.17 Here, however, the relationship is not physical, nor would it be right to see the poem as a biographical statement. (There are many dead women in Feijó's work, but his wife only died in 191 5, two years before her husband.) What is interesting about the poem is the evocation of this kind of psychological relationship, which restricts the poet's imagination to the narrow confines of a coffin. His dreams are 'enlaçados na morta', a poetic formula by which dreams are anthropomorphized and have arms. It is true, though, that we may be dealing here with botanical imagery and that 'enlaçar' may refer to those tropical vines which begin by using a tree as a support and end by suffocating it. It is hard to choose between the two interpretations, since both stress the submission of the poet to the dead woman. Perhaps two stanzas of Teoria do Beijo' will cast some light on this ambiguity: Choráis, constelaçôes! Noites de Lúa! . . . Oremos! A vida é um sonho breve . . . - Duas bocas reunindo os suspiros extremos . . . A saudade colada à rigidez da neve! (. . .) Saturno ergueu as máos no azul, frió levita! É o último estertor . . . - Quatro labios saudando a alvorada infinita; Os dois labios da Morte e os dois labios do Amor!18 Feijó sees life as a brief dream, the kiss as a manifestation of the union between Love and Death, and Saturn as a devouring Moloch whose hands, raised in the blue (a colour typical of the transition to Symbolism and Decadentism), give thanks for the gift of more corpses. The poem is full of stereotyped expressions which recall both Antonio Nobre and Gomes Leal. The relationship between Eros and Thanatos is equally familiar and has already been encountered in the work of José Duro. The single theme of this poem, and its limited vocabulary, which a computer listing would make all 16 Antonio Feijó, Poesías Completas, second edition (Lisbon, undated), pp. 188-89. 17 See 'Auto do Meu Afecto , in Poesías Completas, p. 2.00. 18 Poesías Completas, p. 213</page><page sequence="12">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY III too obvious, indicate the monotonous nature of this aspect of Portuguese poetry and also, I believe, of Portuguese life. Another form of Portuguese necrophiliac sensibility relates to the sea. The cultural tradition is full of references to the wrecks driven ashore onto the beaches of northern Portugal, of evidence of the irrational violence of the great wastes of salt water. The destructive force of the sea is evoked by Antonio Nobre, in necrophiliac detail, in 'Lusitânia no Bairro Latino', a poem dating from 1890-92 published in So: O Mar jazigo de paquetes, de ossos, Que o Sul, às vezes, arrola à praia; Olhos em pedra, que ainda chispam brílhos! Corpo de virgem, que ainda veste a saia, Bracos de mäes, ainda a apertar bracos de filhos! Noiva cadáver ainda com véu . . . Ossadas ainda com os mesmos fatos! Cabeça roxa ainda de chapéu! Pé de defunto que ainda traz sapatos! Boquinha linda que já nao canta . . . Bocas abertas que ainda soltam ais! Noivos em nupcias, ainda, aos bei jos, abracados! Corpo intacto, a boiar (talvez alguma Santa . . .) Ó defuntos do mar! ó roxos arrolados!19 This passage is exemplary since it makes of the sea an immense graveyard, where ships, the physical remains of civilization, are mingled with bones, symbol of man's mortality. In this watery cemetery there appear those familiar couples, found in so much of Portuguese poetry, imperturbably making love after death. Through a fetishistic process, also common in this literary tradition, Antonio Nobre breaks down these corpses, isolating their most symbolic features: bones, skeletons, heads, feet and mouths. It is important to note the almost surrealistic tone of the lines quoted, using the inventory technique whose invention has been erroneously attributed by some to Jacques Prévert. The very strangeness of some of the elements in the inventory gives them prominence, like the 'ossadas ainda com os mesmos fatos' (could they have been wearing different ones?), the remarkable and nightmarish image of the 'cabeça roxa ainda de chapéu', or the 'pé de defunto que ainda traz sapatos' which, like the previous image, makes one think of Surrealist painting (Magritte, for example, or E. L. T. Mesens). Parallel to the image of the sea-ravaged corpse is that of the uncorrupted corpse, which the sea delivers up to the welcoming shore. In the Portuguese tradition these are evidence of sanctity, a theme taken up by Nobre, Gomes Leal and Fernando Pessoa, who gave an initiatory flavour to the theme of 19 Antonio Nobre, So, p. 3 1.</page><page sequence="13">112 ALFREDO MARGARIDO incorruptibility in his Rosicrucian sonnets, which make necrophilia less erotic than ritual. It would not be out of place to mention here a novel in which the amorous intrigue can only be resolved by death at sea. I refer to Camilo Castelo Branco's Amor de Perdicäo, in which Mariana, daughter of the blacksmith Joäo da Cruz, commits suicide by throwing herself into the sea to embrace the corpse of the man she loves, Simâo Botelho, who has died on board ship and is being buried at sea. The situation is comparable, in general terms, to Soares dos Passos's 'Noivado do Sepulcro' and to the poem by Nobre quoted above (even though, for social reasons, Simäo had not returned Mariana's love).20 Against this background, the poetry of Camilo Pessanha stands out as among the most subtly necrophiliac to have been produced at the turn of the century. We do not find in it couples reunited after death, but a recurrent image of the corpse of the loved one, remodelled by the waters and reduced to bones, which are bare of flesh, and so made eternal. But Pessanha does not ignore transitional states of decomposition and stench: indeed, the orgiastic violence of the odour of death is highlighted by the poet, who thereby introduced a new feature to the Portuguese necrophiliac tradition.21 Three sonnets by Pessanha are particularly relevant to our theme. In 'Paisagens de Inverno li', the destructive waters are those of a river: Ficai, cábelos delà, flutuando, E, debaixo das aguas fugidias, Os seus olhos abertos e cismando . . . Onde ides a correr, melancolías? - E, refractadas, tongamente ondeando, As suas mäos translúcidas e frias . . ,22 The emphasis here is on the breaking down of the body into the symbolic components dear to the fetishistic poet: hair, eyes and hands. It is important, too, to note the image of the 'olhos abertos e cismando', immobile under the 'aguas fugidias', which contrasts the lifeless corpse and the constantly flowing water. But the scene may also be considered from the angle of the poet as cold voyeur, surveying what is going on from above. The woman's corpse is completely bloodless, as her translucent hands show, and she has become as white as polished marble. The necrophiliac 20 There are other necrophiliac texts by Camilo. See, for example, No Bom Jesus do Monte (Oporto, undated), pp. 7 i-i 1 5. 21 The fascination with the odour or death throws light on other passages ot ressanha s poetry especially those relating to the symbolism of flowers. 22 Camilo Pessanha, Clepstdra e Outros Poemas (Lisbon, 1969), p. 179. Ihere seems to be a link between this sonnet and one by Antonio Feijó, 'Em Frente do Esquife', published in Líricas e Bucólicas of 1 8 84 : 'E ao ver- te branca e fria, soore o esquife | - Como a onda quebrada no recife | Se desfaz em espuma alvinitente.' The term 'espuma' was also used by Cesário in relation to the female body. This was a rhetorical commonplace in the poetry of the period.</page><page sequence="14">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY II3 element resides precisely in the poet's nostalgic contemplation of her, of her corpse undulating to the rhythm of the waters. The other two sonnets explore the symbolic and mythical image of Venus, giving it a new twist. The opening lines of the first of these two sonnets take up the topos of floating hair: À flor da vaga, o seu cábelo verde Que o torvelinho enreda e desenreda . . . The colour green may seem inappropriate, but it vividly suggests the way the body of Venus takes on elements from maritime flora, like seaweed. These two lines introduce what is perhaps the key to the sonnet: 'O cheiro a carne que nos embebeda!'. This line reflects Pessanha's necrophilia interpreted in terms of Erich Fromm's account of it, suggesting as it does that the poet is intoxicated by the smell of decomposition. The dionysiac quality of the image is important as the following explosive line indicates: 'Em que desvíos a razäo se perde!'. The quatrain that follows is concerned solely with the sensuous impact of putrefaction: Pútrido o ventre, azul e aglutinoso, Que a onda, crassa, num balanço alaga, E reflui (um olfato que se embriaga) Como em um sorvo, murmura de gozo. It is worth noting that the key term 'putrid', used to describe the woman's belly, was used by Fromm in his description of necrophilia. In the second Venus sonnet the intoxication yields to a more aseptic vision of the body of the goddess. There is no corpse, since the sea has cleansed it of flesh and of smells, and the poet, on board a ship, is in a typically voyeuristic situation. This voyeurism is accentuated by the positioning of the poet on the height of a deck from which he can observe the bed of the sea through the clear water: Singra o navio. Sob a agua clara Vê-se o fundo do mar, de areia fina . . . - Impecável figura peregrina, A distancia sem firn que nos separa! From the rail of the ship the voyeur can list those hard remains which have resisted the corrosive power of the water, eternal witnesses to that presence of death which, in the first sonnet, was so profoundly intoxicating: Seixinhos da mais alva porcelana Conchinhas tenuemente cor de rosa Na grisa transparencia luminosa Repousam fundos, sob a agua plana.</page><page sequence="15">114 ALFREDO MARGARIDO £ a vista sonda, reconstruí, compara, Tantos naufragios, perdiçoes, destroçps! - Ò fulgida visäo, linda mentira!23 The thematic link between this sonnet and Nobre's 'Lusitânia no Bairro Latino' is highlighted by the similar use of the inventory technique. How- ever, there is anthropomorphism in Nobre's list, and a certain affective or sentimental quality, which Pessanha avoids by concentrating on hard fragments. There is a shift in emphasis from a description which is impres- sionistic and phenomenological, to one which makes plain the transitory nature of man's physical being which only leaves traces belonging to the inorganic world. Pessanha's use of diminutives suggests that there is an ironical element in his description. Natural and human objects are treated in exactly the same way. The pebbles, 'seixinhos', which are said to be of the "mais alva porcelana', are no different from the 'unhinhas', which are 'tenuemente cor de rosa'. All that remains of the female body are 'róseas unhinhas', 'den- tinhos' and 'pedacinhos de ossos', intermingled with the 'conchas, pedrinhas'. Pessanha's conceptual stripping down of the body, his reduction of it to its basic structure, foreshadows Modernism. In this he can only be compared to Sá-Carneiro, for although Cesano Verde and Antonio Nobre had under- stood the necessity for a revolution in the representation of visual images, they remained attached to conventional forms. I have postponed discussion of part of the work of two important nineteenth-century poets, Joäo Penha and Gomes Leal, who continued to publish necrophiliac poetry at the beginning of the twentieth century. In 1902 Gomes Leal published 'A Mulher de Luto', dedicated to his sister, under the acknowledged influence of Allan Kardec and Swedenborg. The importance of this poem lies in its direct relationship with the Beyond. The same is true of another of his poems, 'O Vaticinio Enigmático': No iniquo tribunal, à luz das velas, Dos juízes as faces amarelas, Se alongam, contra o pálido inocente Mas eis que a campa - ó facto surpreendente! Range . . . fende-se . . . estala a pedra dura, £ a Visäo surge, arqui tremenda e pura! The tomb opens of its own accord, not to reveal a corpse, nor to admit the lover, but to reveal the all-powerful Vision. In these circumstances, the poem can only be understood as the consequence of a spiritualist experience which enables man to escape from the confines of the body. 23 Clepsidra e Outros Poemas, pp. 195-98.</page><page sequence="16">NECROPHILIA IN PORTUGUESE POETRY II5 This cataclysmic revelation of the Beyond can be compared to Pessoa's three sonnets on the tomb of Christian Rosencreutz which describe, perhaps with a greater occultist rigour than Gomes LeaFs, how certain of the dead, after a period of maturation, can be aroused from their sleep. Here, the necrophiliac element should be interpreted as something sacred, far removed from the criminal or pathological. In his poems, Gomes Leal does not disguise his occultism, learnt through his initiation into the Portuguese Order of The Grand Orient, and reinforced by his reading of Kardec and Swedenborg.24 His new view of the world, which was, in part, prompted by the death of his sister, led him to criticize Eça's Correspondencia de Fradique Mendes. Man is not journeying into nothingness, as Mendes had maintained, because nothingness does not exist. In the next world, man should occupy his place in the 'imenso Tudo' This new form of necrophilia is not violent, but respectful, even fearful of mortal remains. Joäo Penha, too, was aware of initiatory practices. Like nearly all progressive intellectuals of his generation, he was a Freemason, but he seems to have gone beyond conventional masonic rites, and more alarming forms of initiation are revealed in a sonnet from Novas Rimas, published in 1905. The sonnet is on the death of the beloved - its title is 'Morta' - and it states that God had forewarned him of the tragic event: Mas, caso horrível, de pavor, que impresso Me ficará na mente a vida inteira; Deus me avisou do trágico sucesso! Eu sonhei, nessa noite, a derradeira, Que ao espelho conia, e doudo, e opresso, Vi em vez do meu rosto, urna caveira!25 Poets who seek to keep open relations with the Beyond, and consequently with the vast hierarchy of spirits, must try to predict the future, as astrol- ogers do. Joäo Penha received warning of a death and he attempted not only to describe the signs, but also to interpret them, thus entering the realms of symbols, warnings and premonitions. But the skull that appears in the place of his face is not his own, but his beloved's. It is as though he cannot face the thought of his own extinction, and consequently banishes it from his dream. This is an act of repression, which leads him to alter the immediate sense of the signs in his dream, to make them apply to his lady, who is, in fact, his double. For it is of the death of the couple that the sonnet speaks, a sonnet which cannot be understood 24 See the sonnet 'A Evocaçâo', in A Mulher de Luto (Lisbon, 1902). 25 Joäo Penna, Novas Rimas (Coimbra, 1905). This is not the only poem in which Penha dreams of the death of his beloved.</page><page sequence="17">Il6 ALFREDO MARGARIDO without a knowledge of occult practice and readings, and even of Buddhism, which seems also to have attracted the poet's attention.26 In this and other sonnets by Penha, as in the poem by Gomes Leal, there is a marked change in poetic vocabulary and practice, and a move away from Positivism. This initiatory poetry has not received the attention it deserves, largely because the Salazar regime was vigorously opposed to non-Catholic practices. The thaw has begun, thanks to the growing interest in the occultist element in Fernando Pessoa, but a full revision is overdue. I am aware that I have laid myself open to criticism by including occult manifestations of this kind as instances of necrophilia. The pathological undertones are mitigated by a rejection of violence, though these poems cannot escape the charge of fetishism. My aim here is a simple, though not a modest one: to reveal the importance of the symbolism and practices associated with death in Portugal. Esoteric religious beliefs and their asso- ciation with traditional poetic topoi should, therefore, not be ignored. The poetry written after Camilo Pessanha is outside the scope of this study but I cannot conclude without recalling that corpse which is central to the poetry of Pessoa: 'Nao tínhamos ainda visto o cadáver do nosso Pai prudente e sabio. Por isso afastamos para um lado o altar. Entäo pudemos levantar urna chapa forte de metal amarelo, e ali estava um belo corpo célebre, inteiro e incorrupto.'27 There are many other ways of saying the same thing, even without invoking the authority of the Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis. École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, Paris 26 See the long afterword published with Novas Rimas. 27 Fernando Pessoa, Obra Poetica (Rio de Janeiro, i960), p. 121. It is true that this is not a genuine corpse, but rather a body frozen in the 'false death' of fairy tales, like the Sleeping Beauty in which the princess is wakened by the prince's passionate kiss. This modifies but does not exclude the necrophiliac element, since the body appears to be lifeless.</page></plain_text>
