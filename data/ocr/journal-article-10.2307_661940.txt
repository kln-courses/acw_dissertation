<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE OF HATO VIEJO, VENEZUELA By GLADYS AYER NOMLAND INTRODUCTION THE Hato Viejo site is located about six and one-half km up-stream from where the Codore river flows into the Caribbean sea. It is also one km north, 700 west of the confluence of that stream with Quebrada El Jebe, in the District of Democracia, State of Falcon, Venezuela.

Recent erosion has produced a network of small gullies which dissect the alluvial flats about 50 m west of the river bank. These have cut into what was, at one time, the site where the Indians lived and interred their dead. The archaeological material was first discovered by Dr. H. F. Stanton, at that time stationed at Urumaco, Venezuela, as field physician for one of the major oil companies. Mention was made of the occurrence to Mr. L. W. Henry and Dr. J. O. Nomland during a routine visit of geological inspection in the area. At the request of the writer, these three accordingly made a trip to Hato Viejo in January, 1930, and collected the material described in this publication. In northern Venezuela the seasonal changes are regular and well-defined owing to the periodic character of the northeast trade winds. The climate is semi-arid with only a few inches of annual rainfall, principally during Octo- ber, November and December. Along the higher mountains inland, the 718</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, N.

Although the Codore is one of the largest streams in the district, water flows through it and reaches the ocean only for very brief periods during the wet season. Nearly vertical beds of sandstone cross the stream, producing barriers of considerable size. Above these the water is impounded in many natural water holes. During the seasonal overflow the holes along the stream become filled so that a sup- ply of water is available even though there has been no rainfall near the coast. On account of the scarcity of water during some seasons of the year the location of water holes was probably the main determinant of the sites of prehistoric villages in this region. The aboriginal inhabitants evidently took advantage of the impounded supply of water at Hato Viejo and lived there for part of the time. During times of drought, which extended over a period of several months each year, they must have moved to the higher moun- tainous region to the south. At present maize is raised during the months of greatest precipitation. ITs probable use as food is indicated by the various metate fragments in the collection. Many present day animals, such as deer, peccary, and the large rodent-like species peculiar to this part of South America, must have been eaten, since their bones are associated with pottery sherds in the Hato Viejo site. Fish must also have been plentiful in the sea a few kilometers to the north. The large number of otoliths of various sizes and shapes derived from several varieties of fish, show that these were used extensively for food. Mollusks also served largely as food. About 80 per cent of the collection consists of shells of the genus Donax, now found recent on the beach. In addition, there are a large number of Tivola shells. The complete list con- sists of the following species: Cardium muricatum Linne, Codakia orbicularis (Linn6), Conus mus Hwass, Cypraea mus Linne, Donax denticulatus Linne, Fascoilaria tulipa Linne, Fissurella nimbosa (Linne), Melongena melongena Linne, Marginella prunum Gmelin, Murex varicosa Linn6, Natica pritchardi Fbs., Oliva reticularis Lamarck, Ostrea prismatica Gray, Strombus pugilus Linne, Solen rufus Buck, Tivola radiata Gray, Triton pileare Lamarck, Tur- ritella variegata Linne.1 The material collected is from a denuded surface midden site and from burial urns found 45 to 60 cm below the dissected surface. The position of the urn, sherd, artifact, and faunal material corresponds closely with that 1 Identification of material by Dr. B. L. Clark of the Department of Paleontology of the University of California.</page><page sequence="4">720 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 35, 1933 noted by Van Koolwijk2 in the small island of Aruba, off the north coast of Venezuela, where the graves were overlaid with sherds, faunal material and artifacts at the probable locality of the dwelling site. Broken vessels and fragmentary sherds collected comprise parts of funeral urns, pots, jars, bowls, braziers and other utensils. Some burial urns contained parts of human skeletons, others were empty; some bodies apparently were not bur- ied in urns. One large urn contained the major portion of two children's skeletons. These had been decapitated and the heads placed in smaller urns, which in turn were placed inside a larger urn. Some urns had broken sherds thrown in over the skeletal remains, others contained cobblestones. A black asphaltic ornament was found in one urn (fig. 7d). A human adult humerus was examined by Dr. H. F. Stanton, according to whom the curvature indi- cated rickets. A part of the site was undoubtedly a burial center. Decapita- tion and the smallness of the urns indicate secondary urn burial.3 Probably most of the sherd fragments came from ceremonial vessels that were "killed" before being deposited. The collection is made up mostly of sherds, there being only a few vessels which show size and form. Wares represented are given in order of their complexity,4 the simplest being the coarse, plain, unslipped, unpainted, gray-brown and red ware; next, the slipped gray-brown and red ware; the geometrically painted black on white; maroon on buff; red on terra-cotta; red on buff; and polychrome black and red on buff. Most frequent is the black on white painted ware; next in order of frequency come the plain gray-brown ware; slipped gray- brown and redware; plain red ware; maroon on buff painted ware; red on terra-cotta; polychrome; and black on red. The black on white varies from black to brown and from pure white through gray to cream. The ware here called black-on-white is designated as brown-on-white by Josselin de Jong. Apparently the body of the vessel was coiled while the annular bases 2 Josselin de Jong, 55. Bibliographic references will be found at end of this article. 3 From Knippe, Curagao, A. J. Van Koolwijk (Josselin de Jong, 58) discovered bodies in an upright position with the head covered with a second dish and concluded from his obser- vations that: "The Indians, former inhabitants of Curagao, probably buried the bodies of their fellow-creatures without coffins .... So I suppose that they first laid down their dead in a grave and covered them with earth, leaving them there till the soft parts of those bodies were decayed, after which they collected the bones and buried them in their huts in the manner above mentioned. I say in their huts, for the spots where I discovered those bones is in the middle of the ancient camp." This conclusion seems justified in the Hato Viejo site because the small urns could not possibly hold an adult body although adult bones were found in them. Also the observation of the burial in the hut seems corroborated in Hato Viejo, since the sherds, artifacts, faunal ma- terial, and burial urns were mixed together indiscriminately in the site. 4 Nomenclature of Lothrop, 1: 109-110.</page><page sequence="5">NOMLAND] HA TO VIEJO, VENEZUELA 721 appear to have been shaped by the direct method, as described by Krieger5 and Josselin de Jong." The overlapping of the coils on the inside as described by Roth7 and pictured by Josselin de Jong,8 is clearly shown by the cleavage of the broken sherds. CLAYS AND FIRING, SHAPING AND MODELING Clays of the simpler, cruder types of vessels, such as the undecorated gray-brown ware, all seem to have been derived from the same or nearby pits. Ordinary coarse beach sand and coarsely pounded shell were mixed with it for tempering. Both are visible to the naked eye, while a magnifica- tion of twenty diameters shows that the clay of this series has been care- lessly washed and worked before adding the temper. The workmanship was also careless, the vessel walls thick (.3 to 1.2 cm), the break always uneven and generally very rough. In the better painted vessels the clay seems to have come from another locality. It is fine and shows a greasy lustre in place of the ashy appearance of the coarser vessels. Finely ground shell, fine beach sand, and, in some of the best specimens, black magnetite beach sand are used for tempering. Firing was probably not carried on at high tempera- tures. Two vessels of the entire site are the only ones that show oxidation on the outside. The remainder appear to be even less intensely fired, with few traces of discolorations or streaking. All of the simpler, plain wares are coarser than the more complex slipped, modeled and painted wares. UNSLIPPED, UNPAINTED WARE Plain Gray-Brown Ware.-The nine pieces of this series include bowls, jars, funeral urn and stove censer. They are all circular and show undeco- rated recurved, direct and outcurved rims which are relatively high (3 cm), thin and solid (fig. 2a, c, p, r; Josselin de Jong, pl. xvi 3, 21, 25).9 Three vessels have annular bases, the largest of which is 12 cm in diameter. One shows four free supports which have broken off. Another fragment shows a luted, looped handle, probably an ornamental figurine head, broken from the upper segment of the body and lost. The stove censer has an annular base 12 cm in diameter and 3.5 cm in height which has two opposed air- draught holes 1.75 cm in diameter. This specimen of stove censer is large and apparently utilitarian. It shows considerable use on the inside, the bot- 5 Krieger, 1926, 64.

Discussing censers with air-draught perforations, Linn6 says'0 This vessel may possibly be supposed to have been used for incense-burning, but may equally well have been employed in metallurgical operations. Certainly the above specimen lends color to this supposition when compared with the other small, decorated, delicately made specimens of the more complex painted type to be described later. Of small size, thin-walled and elaborately decorated, they were probably not intended for ordinary use. In the same discussion, Linn6 also states that: The custom of incense burning is beyond a doubt a loan from the high cultures of Central America .... Its sparse occurrence in South America must be due to it having been more generally diffused only in comparatively late times. In the Hato Viejo site, incense censers are not of sparse occurrence. They are represented in the gray-brown unslipped ware, red unslipped ware, and three specimens are encountered in the black-on-white painted ware. They are lacking in the other painted wares, but since the occurrence of such wares in the site is- slight, this fact does not prove their absence there. Lo- throp" shows one figure of this type of vessel from Costa Rica and Nicara- gua, while Krieger'2 has four figures for southeastern Panama. If these are proportional to the other wares shown, they accord well with the occur- rence in Hato Viejo. Corrugated Necked Vessels.-Corrugated necked vessels are shown in five fragments of large pots. The corrugations are overlapped and roughly pinched on to each other, smoothed on the inside and allowed to remain rough on the neck for decoration. The top coil is thinned and trimmed or beveled on the edge. Three coils are usual, but four occur in two instances (fig. 2f, k, n). These vessels show outcurved or straight thin rims, beveled and rounded, from 2.5 to 5.5 cm high. A two-finger handle occurs in one smaller vessel which is luted onto the upper segment of the body and the top coil of the rim, making a continuous line between the out-rolled rim coil and the handle (fig. 2 i,j). These corrugated wares are comparable to those described by Roth," Krieger,'4 and especially by Josselin de Jong.'5 Punctate Necked Vessels.-Punctate necked vessels are of better mixed 10 Linne, 1929, 259. 11 Lothrop, 1, 126, fig. 32. 12 Krieger, 1926, pl. 13, figs. 2, 3; pl. 14, figs. 1, 3, 13 Roth, 131. 14 Krieger, 1926, 64.

All exam- ples have two-finger luted-on handles extending from the upper segment of the body to the rim coil (fig. 2d), (three- and four-finger handles shown by Josselin de Jong.)"6 One vessel is burned red on the outside and two are blackened by fire. Decorations consist of punctures spaced evenly on the coils similar to those on vessels shown by Linn6'7 from Trigana, Colombia, by Josselin de Jong"8 from the islands north ofVenezuela, and also described by Krieger19 from Santo Domingo. Krieger designates this style of decora- tion as This archaic design pattern which appears also on South American earthen ware vessels from Venezuela and Colombia.20 This statement is not warranted for the Hato Viejo site, since there is no stratification from which conclusions can be drawn. Pottery from widely separated regions often bears the same symbols; for example, punctate necked pottery fragments from the Kulki river, Kamchatka,21 are almost identical with those of Hato Viejo, yet there is no proof of cultural connec- tion. One specimen of this ware shows a coil around the handle ends which is stylused evenly, while the handle and neck remain plain (fig. 2n; Josselin de Jong, pl. xxI, 21). A fragment of a large globular bowl or jar of very coarse clay, shell and sand, 1.2 cm in thickness has a straight neck 3 cm high, which is encircled by an incised line at the joint between neck and body. A long, meandering roll of clay representing an anthropomorphic arm and hand decorates the upper segment of the body just below the high shoulder ridge. The modeled arm is deeply cross-incised and decorated with a split node on the up-curve. The hand is an enlargement of the clay roll into a raised node, and fingers are represented by three deep transverse inci- sions (fig. 2 p). These meandering rolls of clay are called by Josselin de Jong22 plastic frog-leg decorations. He classes rolls of clay terminating in split rim nodes as claws gripping the rim and characterizes most curved raised ridges with knobs as essential characters of frog decoration. This may or may not be true for Hato Viejo, since no complete frog figure is present in the collection. The material described and pictured for Aruba, Curagao and Bonaire is so similar that such figures probably existed but are not shown on the fragments. However, Krieger23 shows a pitcher vase from Tule pot- tery with an effigy head and plastic modeled arms and hands on the upper 16 Josselin de Jong, pl. xxI, 22. 17 Linn6, 1929, 34, fig. 9c: F, H, I. 18 Josselin de Jong, pl. xv, 6-15; pl. xxI, 1-4, 21-22; pl. xxII, 24-26. 19 Krieger, 1931, 53, 54; pl. 25, figs. 1, 2, 4. 20 Krieger, 1931, 54. 21 Jochelson, pl. 19. 22 Josselin de Jong, 80-81; pl. xvIII, 57. 23 Krieger, 1926, pl. 14, 5.</page><page sequence="9">NOMLAND] HA TO VIEJO, VENEZUELA 725 segment of the vessel, which certainly are not frog characters although re- sembling Hato Viejo specimens. Another variant of the general ware is a globose bowl or jar approxi- mately 17.5 cm in mouth diameter, which shows a solid, low outcurved neck with a rounded edge. The base of the neck is concave, with a well de- fined convex coil encircling the vessel under the concave neck. This coil is not laid on, as in other instances, but shows clearly that the entire neck and rim were shaped from the moist clay of the body and neck by a cut-out trimmer or shaper such as that described by Linn624 and others. The handle of this bowl is also aberrant and is the single representative of its kind. It is an elongated split node 3.8 cm long, placed horizontal to the neck on the extreme upper segment of the body. The ware is very thin (.3 cm thick), of pure, finely mixed clay, which differs from that of the other vessels. It is tempered with black beach sand and has a high ringing tone when handled or struck with another object (fig. 2r, s, t). A large, hollow, luted-on "mammiform" type of decoration, 7 cm in diameter, has a slightly constricted neck and three flattened nodes sur- rounding the unflattened nipple. It is the only representative of this type of decoration described by Fewkes25 for Porto Rico. Another variant of the corrugated-neck type of vessel is a globular pot approximately 17 cm at the mouth, with a high shoulder, showing one two-finger handle made of two rolls of clay luted on at the bottom to the upper body segment and pinched together in the median line. Each clay coil of the handle is separated at the rim, encompassing the edge and encircling the entire vessel. This forms a solid out-rolled rim continuous with the two-finger handle. It is a very soft, fine ware with black sand for temper. There is no assurance that there were not two handles to the vessel (fig. 2, i, j). Red Ware.-The six pieces of this ware follow the general description for the plain gray-brown ware, characterized by coarse, ill-worked red clay, shell temper, poor firing, careless workmanship, but thinner-walled vessels (.5 to .7 cm thick). According to Josselin de Jong, the red ware of Aruba, Curagao and Bonaire may be baked through with a wash of finer material or red dye applied to the surface, but there is no corresponding wash on the red ware of this series, and the clay itself appears to have been colored. The vessels identified from the fragments are large jars and bowls, probably ceremonial or ritual vessels, since they show no evidences of use, and were probably "killed," as were the rest of the wares of the site. The plain red ware shows the same plain thin, direct, straight, outflared and 4 Linn6, 1925, 94. m Fewkes, 1907a, 186.</page><page sequence="10">726 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 35, 1933 outcurved necks with beveled edge and no noticeable joint between neck and body. One specimen has a punctate decorated coil of clay luted on to the neck at the junction of neck and body. Handles show considerable variation. The circular loop handle is luted on from the upper segment of the body to the rim. A very large looped han- dle (3.5 cm across and 7.2 cm from the luted-on end to the break, which seems to be about midway), is composed of two rolls of clay smoothed on the outer surface and allowed to remain rounded on the under side. This handle is decorated at its joint with the body by a design of opposed incised triangles filled with irregular punctations (fig. 3d, e, f). A funeral urn lid with its flat-domed body and very outflaring rim is decorated with a flattened loop handle. The handle spans a very short space between the rim and body and is ornamented with a triple incised node on its greatest curvature. Josselin de Jong26 says that the incised node may be a human nose or frog leg blended in their conventionalized form. In Hato Viejo the split or double-crossed incised node is used as a separate element of ornamentation, and, so far as can be ascertained, does not coincide with his analysis. Broad, flat, node-decorated handles, roughly quadrangular in form, are character- istic of all wares of the site. Body decoration consists of deep stylus punctures encircling the upper segment close to the neck, and coils of deeply cross-incised clay rolls mod- eled on the body in the same position (fig. 2p). One fragment of a small straight-legged, six-toed foot, decorated with a twisted clay anklet appears to have been a free support for a small vessel. The specimen is 3 cm from toe to break, 2 cm in widest diameter, and appears to have been made from two clay coils pinched together in the median line, then smoothed and decorated. The toes are represented by transverse incisions. The little speci- men suggests the intention of a human representation, but the lack of arch, vamp and heel probably indicates an animal. The friable, poorly fired frag- ment shows considerable wear on the palmar surface. An identical specimen is pictured by Josselin de Jong.27 SLIPPED WARE Gray-Brown Ware.-Slipped ware is usually of better mixed clay, finer temper, although still mainly shell, thinner-walled (.5 to .8 cm) and better manufactured. The slip is applied either outside, inside, or on both sides. It appears to be a thick paste-like clay ranging from gray white to cream because of differences in weathering. Some slips have a distinct body and 26 Josselin de Jong, 81. 27 Josselin de Jong, pl. xxI, 33.</page><page sequence="11">NOMLAND] HA TO VIEJO, VENEZUELA 727 ~f "vi...../ // x \ / I/ x I/ ,' L&gt; I // b a d." e / \\ Se 1 ~ A~ 1 I \ /Ii Ik /// II m //z -- -- I -\ Ix ~   l  . ... ?

Vessels of this series are three funeral urn covers with their characteristic wide, flaring rims, quadrangular looped handles with raised node decora- tion; three annular supports for censers and bowls; hollow rimmed wide mouthed jars with luted-on handles, possible anthropomorphic or zoomor- phic figures; solid direct rim with raised nodes on the margin, resembling those pictured by Josselin de Jong for Aruba, Curagao, and Bonaire (pl. xvIIi, 38, 42, 45), (fig. 4cf, g, p; fig. 3a, b, c). There are several large coarsely made and tempered globose bowls with modeled arms and hands, cross-in- cised and plain, on the body of the vessel. Two annular bases are convex and outcurved where they are incorporated with the entire bottom of the vessel; one is straight-walled and luted onto the bottom of the vessel with free spaces between the joints, like the censers. One censer base shows no evidences of use, although there are four air-draught holes (1.3 cm in diam- eter) in the annular base. The slip is worn off through weathering but the vessel is not blackened. Another censer base (3.5 cm high) has been luted onto the bottom of the vessel with air draughts through the free spaces be- tween the joints. It is made of coarse material with heavy shell and sand tempering, while the two annular bases of finer mixed clay and shell temper have a ringing tone when handled (fig. 3a, b, c). The thin ringing specimens have decorations of raised, knobbed rims, modeled arms and hands, raised split nodes on the body and a heavy circular handle, or zoomorphic and an- thropomorphic figurines luted to the upper body and marginal to the rim. Hollow rims are both incurved and inrolled. Funeral urn tops, similar in design to the finer black on white painted ware, have the quadrangular looped handle which is characteristic of this type of vessel. They are usu- ally decorated with a raised node just above the greatest curvature, and many times a roll of clay is laid on the loop handle at the edges and inser- tions, forming a square with the raised node in the center (fig. 4c, f, g, o). Raised nodes widely separated, and without pattern or grouping, decorate the rim and body of vessels. Two fragments of vessel rims of good slipped gray-brown ware have raised looped handles running parallel to the rim. The clay ribbons forming the loops above the rim are much flattened medially and decorated with the ubiquitous raised nodes (fig. 3g, i, I-n; Josselin de Jong, pl. xix, fig. 44). One small fragment, of rather coarse ware, has a heavy clay slip, which is decorated with very fine parallel incised lines, eight or nine to each band, which are crossed in a diamond pattern (fig. 8j). Red Ware.-This ware also runs from coarse, poorly mixed to finer bet-</page><page sequence="14">730 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 35, 1933 ter worked clay. Out of the eleven pieces represented in the group, eight are annular bases of three different types, and three of them upper body seg- ment and rim, showing raised ornaments and horizontally extended loop handles (fig. 3 g-i, i-n). The bases are of coarse to medium fine red clays, from .25 cm to .7 cm in thickness. They are 2.5 to 4 cm in height and al- most straight, with some convexity at the middle and a concave depression at the point between the base and the vessel proper. There is very little dif- ference between the sizes (8.5 to 11 cm diameter), and they show no evi- dences of use. They are slipped with a thick, pasty red clay, which has be- come somewhat streaked with black in firing. Five of the eight bases are un- decorated, two have slightly outcurved rims with punctations spaced evenly around the base and body joint; one is the censer type of base described under the slipped gray-brown ware and has a heavy cream slip over the red. This sherd has a red slip inside and a raised node decoration at the point where the base is luted to the body of the superimposed vessel. The base or ring proper was apparently modeled in one piece and reinforced by a roll of clay on the inside and outside of the pot at the joint. All of the bases with ad- herent pieces of the vessel show that the superincumbent pots were very slightly rounded on the bottom and flared out at almost right angles to the ring, indicating that the pots must have been of large size. Their uniformity of size, color, decoration, and lack of evidences of use, as well as the paucity of sherds adhering to the ring bases (fig. 4j), all point to ceremonial or ritual vessels that have been "killed." The luted-on one-piece type of base prob- ably separated from the body intact, while the vessel bowl was broken into indistinguishable fragments. Three sherds showing body, rim, and handle, all represent globular bowls with incurved hollow ornamented rims. Two pieces have the raised, horizontally extended handle of one loop only; how- ever, double, or even multiple handles may have been present and not shown because of the small size of the sherd. The single loop handle is orna- mented on top with raised smooth button nodes or the cross-incised node simulating a hand at the end of plastic modeled body decoration. Such body decoration appears on two specimens but not in the third. PAINTED WARE Black-on-White.-The sixty-six pieces of black-on-white ware are of dis- tinctly better quality than any thus far described. The sherds of this ware are much thinner and have a distinct "ring." Clay is fine and well mixed with finely ground shell or black magnetite beach sand for temper. Vessels are carefully made and well fired. On the whole, the painted decora- tion is executed with much skill although careless work appears at its side.</page><page sequence="15">NOMLAND] HA TO VIEJO, VENEZUELA 731 The vessels represented are funerary urns, stove censer bases, bowls, jars, etc., described under the simpler wares, but with additional forms appearing, either coincident with the numerical increase of sherds, or con- current with increased complexity of design and form. Bowls are both painted and modeled. Jars are globose and thicker-walled than other painted ware. They show outcurved, direct, and inrolled rims and are orna- mented with painting outside and inside. Geometric rectilinear and triangu- lar designs appear with some incised node modeling (fig. 4a-c, e, h-j, i-o; fig. 8a, k). The most characteristic new forms are the pottery stand similar to that described and figured by Lothrop and Dorsey;28 the flat, dome-like, wide, outflaring rimmed funerary urn lids; two anthropomorphic marginal figurines of the "bloated-face" type described by Krieger29 for Santo Do- mingo; two hollow legs broken from the vessel which they supported, simi- lar to the tripod legs from Central America; zoomorphic handles and rim figurines and parts of funerary urns (fig. 4c, f, g, i-k, o-q) one of which contained the skeletal remains of two children previously mentioned. The pottery stand is 12 cm high and 20 cm across the top. It has two round air-draught holes 3.5 cm in diameter, on and above the equatorial ridge of the vessel. The curious inward-dipping lip is the only representa- tive in the collection and differs from the stands shown by Lothrop in having a thin, wide rim flaring toward the center of the vessel. Both the outside of the stove and the in-dipping lip are decorated with black line design on a dull white slip (fig. 4, 1-n). The funerary urn lid measures 30 cm from one broken edge to the other. It is possible only to approximate the size of the lids, but since the opening of the largest urn approximates 47 cm in diameter, the lids must have been of slightly larger diameter in order to cover the mouth. It is decorated with broad and narrow encircling, opposing and triangular black lines on a flat white slip. Two flat, quadrangular looped handles, in addition to being painted, are decorated with a cross-hatched raised node at their greatest curvature (fig. 4c). Double-looped rim handles, horizontally extended, are plentiful in this ware. The plain loop seems to be a terminal coil pinched out flat and raised above the margin of the rim. Elaborations of this type of handle reach the highest development in the large human, "bloated-face" marginal figure placed in the center of a double-looped handle as a rim decoration. The head is 5 by 5 cm in diameter with three upright nodes simulating a head- 28 Lothrop, vol. 2, 36S; fig. 260a; pl. CLXXXVII, a-f; Dorsey, pl.

The stirrup- shaped top of the looped handles is a prolongation of the sides of the face, which in turn is decorated with rolls of clay luted on the margin and orna- mented at three corner angles with a plain raised node. The eyes of the figurine are formed by an applied ribbon of clay with a central slip, which is the "coffee bean" type spoken of by Krieger31 as a rare, archaic form for Santo Domingo and described by Spinden for the valley of Mexico.32 The nose is triangular in shape and placed well above the eyes, while the mouth, also of the coffee-bean type, is luted onto the modeled face(fig.4f, g). The eyes and mouth of the other figure follow the same general description as those of the above described specimen. The head-dress consists of two horn-like projections. The nose is represented by a raised node, in normal nasal posi- tion, with two deep incisions across it for the nostrils. Ears show pits for decorations (fig. 4p). Modeled plastic and painted anthropomorphic figur- ines are shown by Josselin de Jong33 for Aruba, Curagao and Bonaire. He calls them frogs with human heads34 and suggests that: The whole category refers to mythical beings; in which case the peculiar, half- human, half-animal character of these faces would, at least a priori present no difficulty.35 This opinion coincides with that of Holmes36 for the figurines of Chiriqui: I feel inclined to take the view that in their present condition they are survivals of ideographic originals,... The animals made use of originally were the embodi- ment of mythologic conceptions, and their images revered or served as fetishes or charms, and because of this they came to have a permanent place in art. Many rims continue to follow the forms of simpler, plain and slipped ware, but new forms, as well as a greater abundance of hollow rims, appear in the modeled and painted ware. Plain raised nodes encircling the vessel on the margin of the rim as terminations of the modeled meandering arms are common and apparently only for decoration. Two hollow legs similar to the tripod legs from Central America are broken from the vessel they supported. The hollow orifice is wider at the top than at the bottom, which suggests that they may have held clay pellets or pebbles, as is so common in the Central American wares. They are orna- mented with raised nodes outlined with black lines and painted cross- hachure between the lines (fig. 4i) Cross-hatching in pigment seems to take the place of cross-incision of the simpler wares, and modeling is embel- lished with painting in this series. 30 Krieger, 1931, 55. 31 Krieger, 1931, 54. 32 Spinden, 52, 53. 3 Josselin de Jong, 71, figs. 23, 23a, b.

Most zoomorphic marginal figurines are present on the inrolled, hollow rim. Various orna- ments in relief, such as heads, handles, legs and bases of vessels, were usu- ally constructed separately and luted to the walls. The relief work is con- ventionalized and grotesque, probably representing such tutelary images as Holmes37 mentions for Chiriqui. Funeral urns are approximately 42 cm in equatorial diameter and 30 cm or more in height. They have an almost pointed base, and are painted in rectilinear and triangular designs on the incurvature of the upper segment (fig. 4b). Josselin de Jong speaks38 of unpainted urns but with traces of polish from the islands north of Venezuela. This feature is lacking in the Hato Viejo site. One specimen of a shallow food plate is all that is found in the site. It is not of the crude, undecorated, undifferentiated type described by Krieger39 as an early Arawak form, but is well made, tempered and fired, and is painted on the incurved upper exterior walls. It has many marks of the smoother on the inside floor (fig. 4d). The continuing fgrms are bowls, jars, urns, censers, etc., similar to those of the simpler wares, which are elaborately painted in geometric designs. Censer bases are finely made and elaborately decorated in painted tri- angular and rectilinear designs combined with the painted cross-hatched raised node (fig. 8k). Josselin de Jong40 shows a similar specimen, which he called a "handle with a foot-like projection." Red on Terra-Cotta.-The four pieces representing dark red on terra- cotta are all figurine heads. Two are hollow luted-on animal heads, one ornamented with a ring of clay and punctations around the end of the long snout, the other painted in fine lines across the snout, and in solid red over the upper part of the head and upstanding ears. No eye representation oc- curs in these figures, but the ears of both are small and upright like those of the armadillo (fig. 5b, d; Josselin de Jong, pl. xIx, 8, 11, 16, 36-42; p. 71, fig. 24, 24a). The other two specimens are animal heads luted to the body above the equatorial zone of the vessel, with the hollow snout pointing upward and forming a spout for the vessel. The eye forms of the two specimens are quite different. One (fig. 5c) has a roll of clay luted on around a circular button. The other (fig. 5a) has a large triangular incision with a central but- ton of clay, which simulates an alligator eye. Both specimens are painted: one all over the outside, and the other on the upper concave surface. 37 Holmes, 152. 38 Josselin de Jong, 65, 78. 39 Krieger, 1931, 64. 4oJosselin de Jong, 71, pl. xviii, 23.</page><page sequence="18">734 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 35, 1933 /0 |wl m a I' e I , h I FIG. 5.

The animal head has no eyes or other indicative features except the general shape and up- standing armadillo-like ears. Design elements for the bowls and base are the above-mentioned encircling and opposed broad and narrow lines. Maroon-on-Cream.-This ware is differentiated from the red on buff by the paste and workmanship. It contains both coarse, thick, heavily shell- tempered painted and modeled ware, and also a thinner light colored clay ware, which is embellished with carefully executed and more complicated design elements. The heavy, cruder ware shows raised rim nodes and circu- lar button eye elements, combined with modeled and painted design on the outside, and painted design inside. Two bowls are painted on the upper segment with a wide band of op- posed lines and triangle (fig. 5e, g). This ware also shows the flat, horizon- tally extended marginal loop handle. The most complete piece of the series is a small jar of thin paste showing a slightly out-flaring rim and animal head figurine spout on the upper segment of the vessel. It has a painted band design of repeated units, which extends to below the equatorial shoulder (fig. 5f). This feature is unusual except where there is an all-over design. Black-on-Red.-Black-on-red painted ware is represented by one piece only. It appears to be alien to all other wares in the site. It is of different, very compact clay which is tempered with a few quartz sand grains and very fine shell fragments. It has a greasy luster in fracture. The thick red paint has penetrated more deeply than in other wares and shows small fractures filled with pigment extending into the vessel. The design, while maintaining some elements of the other wares, such as the open scroll and encircling lines in a band on the upper segment, shows finer brushwork and more facile handling of the design elements. A double ladder motif is used, which is not found in any other decorated ware. The specimen appears to be from a more highly developed pottery technique and may have been a trade piece (fig. 5j). Polychrome.-Polychrome vessels are represented by one almost com- plete ring-base bowl of superior grace and symmetry, and four fragments of indistinguishable vessels, painted in geometric triangular design of parallel lines in black and red on a cream background. The ware is medium thin and heavily tempered with finely ground shell. The ring base bowl is deco- rated with brown-and-tan repeated units in a band design on the upper concave sector of the body. The remainder of the bowl has bands of encir- cling lines of tan on bright red. Most of the design is worn off, leaving an under slip of bright red paint (fig. 5h). The four fragments are similarly colored in geometric designs of parallel lines (fig. 5i).</page><page sequence="20">736 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 35, 1933 STONE IMPLEMENTS Stone implements recovered from the site include axes of various sizes and shapes, hammers, an oblong pestle, fragments of a metate, one grind- ing-stone, a gouge, petaloid celts, and problematical pieces of polished stone, quartz, hornblend, granite and red jasper. The latter three substances are not now found in that general vicinity. Some of the highly polished im- plements are made of a greenish basic intrusive rock which is also not known from that locality but is definitely known to occur in outcrop on the Paraguana peninsula. Axes are broad-necked, narrow-necked, asymmetrical, and with notched top. They are manufactured from both black and greenish stone and bear a high polish and a sharp cutting edge (fig. 7n). They range in size from 5.5 cm to more than 8 cm in length, 3 to 5 cm wide and from 1 to 2.5 cm in thickness. Some are polished all over and others remain rough near the top. The notched specimen is 3 cm wide at the cutting edge, 4.5 cm from edge to the notch, which is 3 cm wide from point to point, and 5.5 cm from the cut- ting edge to the outer angle point (fig. 7g, h, i). Side view of the specimen shows that it is asymmetrical. Two hammers are found in the collection. The larger one is broken at the top and appears to have been originally a large axe blade. The other is an asymmetrical oval with straight sides and highly polished surface. It is made of the Paraguana green stone and shows traces of having been used both as a hammer and polisher. The top portion is broken so that no esti- mate can be made as to its length or possible finish (fig. 7 a-c, e, f; Josselin de Jong, pl. xxIII, 104). The pestle fragment is of coarse sandstone, oval in shape and tapering to the poll pointed handle. The metate is made of the same material. All that can be told of the latter fragment is that it has a concave grinding surface about 3.5 cm thick, with low outflaring walls (fig. 6n, p, q; Josselin de Jong, pp. 102, 132). The grinding stone is of fine sandstone and shows evidences of long use (fig. 6c, d). The gouge is of black stone 4.5 cm long, tapering from the top, broken portion, to a narrow cutting edge at the bottom. It is flat and some- what rough on the under surface, while the upper side is roughly triangular in section and highly polished all over (fig. 6k, 1, m). This specimen corre- sponds to those shown by Josselin de Jong (pl. xxiv, 29-38).

Both ends of the specimen are fractured so that its size cannot be estimated. It is ovoid, beautifully tapered and highly polished (fig. 6a, b). SUMMARY The crude ware is plain and modeled. Finer painted wares are generally of better workmanship and more complex design. Plastic modeling is com- mon to all wares of the site except the black-on-red. It consists mainly of realistic and grotesque, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic heads, raised in- cised nodes, and meandering rolls of clay situated on the rim, neck and up- per equatorial zone of the vessels. Luted-on models in the round may serve as decoration, handle, or spout for the pot. Painted design is geometric and rectilinear with some attempt at semi-curvilinear patterns. Parallel lines meeting one another at various angles usually form a panel which roughly encircles the upper half of the outer wall of the vessel. Design elements are not many; they are handled quite similarly but in different combinations. The encircling band decoration is generally of re- peated or alternated identical units, with the open and meander scroll en- closed by geometric parallel lines (figs. 4, 5, 8). Pottery from Hato Viejo very closely resembles in point of form and ornamentation, ceramics from the islands of Aruba, Curagao and Bonaire. Similarities to eastern Venezuelan pottery are in plastic modeling on the upper segment of the vessel walls, but not in form or design. The Antillean similarities are greater in modeling, design elements, and position of the painted area. To the west, certain similarities are apparent throughout the Panamanian region and extending into Central America. However, so little work has been done in northern South America that comparison with other localities must await detailed investigations. Hato Viejo is rich in well-worked stone implements. They show close similarity to those of Aruba, Curagao and Bonaire, as well as to certain objects, such as the petaloid celts, from the Greater Antilles, and Northern South America. All specimens indicate a high degree of skill in stone work. In point of time no conclusions can be drawn since no stratigraphy has been established. Crude and primitive-looking pots and designs compared with a more advanced type of pottery are assumed to be earlier, but the assumption would have to be supported by corroborative evidence. The cruder ware may be representative of the common cooking-vessels or consti- tute an archaic survival, while the more complex specialized ware may have only ceremonial and ritual use, so that both wares are conceivably contem- poraneous. 46 Josselin de Jong, pl. xxII, 32.</page><page sequence="24">740 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 35, 1933 a b c e d 4* 1 FIG. 8.
