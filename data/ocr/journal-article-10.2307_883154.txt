Even though many major publications and exhibitions have been devoted to Cubo-Futurism, Suprematism and Constructivism and to the artists who pioneered these movements (Pavel Filonov, Mikhail Larionov, Kazimir Malevich, Alexander Rodchenko, Vladimir Tatlin, etc.), there are still important art- istic discoveries to be made and biographies to be written (e.g. of Ivan Kliun and Olga Rozanova). With these two detailed examinations of Alexander Mikhailovich Rodchenko (1891-1956) and Alexander Alexandrovich Vesnin (1883-1959), the Soviet historian Selim Khan-Magomedov helps to broaden our appreciation of the complex mosaic of Russian Modernism, to correct certain misconceptions, and to bring into focus and emphasise a number of formative interconnections within the avant-garde. Of particular value are the author's copious excerpts from theoretical and critical statements relating to Russian art of the 1910s and 20s, especially in the Rodchenko monograph, introducing us, thereby, to judgments and conclusions by Abram Efros, Vasilii Kandinsky, Vladimir Maiakovsky, Yakov Tugendkhold, Sergei Yutkevich and many other key represen- tatives of modern Russian culture. Khan-Magomedov's style of writing is not dynamic (a characteristic that is not improved by the translations here) and does not communicate the excitement, the scintillation of the 1910s and 20s that gal- vanised the avant-garde into action. How- ever, this is not necessarily an impediment, for there are positive aspects of these two books that far outweigh the dullness of prose. By relying substantially on archival sources, (unfortunately, he does not always indicate their whereabouts), Khan-Magomedov has established the exact and intricate chron- ologies of the professional training, exhibi- tions and institutional affiliations pertaining to both Rodchenko and Vesnin, particu- larly for the period c. 1917-c. 1925. This is a service much appreciated since, hitherto, the data have been inadequate and often incorrect. Practical information of this kind is especially important in the context of Rodchenko's meteoric development as an abstract painter and then Constructivist designer in 1918-23, when he progressed rapidly from his monochrome pictures (e.g. the black on black series of 1918 and the red, yellow and blue triptych of 1921) to his notion of utilitarian design. As Khan-Magomedov implies, Rod- chenko worked with reason, but not always logic, and he observed his own inner, aes- thetic sequence. The artist evolved from the extreme pictorial statements made by Malevich and his colleagues in 1915 on- wards to the perception of design as a preferred and extremely potential area of creative endeavour - leading immediately to the concept of applied or functional Constructivism in 1921, debated and for- mulated at Inkhuk (Institute of Artistic Culture) in Moscow (an episode that is very well documented here). The discussion of Rodchenko's interpretation of this aes- thetic, manifesting itself in his projects for lamps, cigarette packs, universal furniture, ceramics, overalls, theatrical sets and cos- tumes, etc. provides us with a comprehen- sive lexicon of Rodchenko's design proto- types, and a number of them are reproduced here for the first time. A traditional assumption about the Russian avant-garde is that it was profoundly affected - transformed - by the Revolution of 1917, and that the emergence of Con- structivism, for example, was a direct con- sequence of this socio-political event. Khan-Magomedov does not question this conventional explanation and perpetuates the mythology that Rodchenko, and Liubov Popova, Varvara Stepanova, Vesnin, etc., became Constructivists as a direct result of the Revolution, i.e. that their experi- ments were an outgrowth of the concepts of democracy, proletarian culture, the machine esthetic and internationalism that followed in the wake of October 1917. 680</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS This conventional argument is, however, not entirely valid, because the Construc- tivists, including Rodchenko and Vesnin, were 'Constructivists' well before the Revolution. For example, Alexandra Exter, Popova, Rodchenko, Ivan Puni, etc. were working on the design of clothes and access- ories for the Moscow and St Petersburg middle classes and contributed to exhi- bitions of decorative art in private galleries. In other words, the Revolution may have encouraged certain artistic tendencies of the avant-garde, but it did not necessarily create them. Furthermore, in the 1920s the avant-garde was as fragmented and dis- united as it had been in the early 1910s, for, as Khan-Magomedov writes, it was a 'constellation of outstanding and contrast- ing figures .... Rodchenko experimented with a wide variety of artistic forms, blur- ring the boundaries between them' (p.9). Acceptance of, or acquiescence to, the Revolution did not, however, provide a uniform ideological common denominator to these contrasting figures. That the Revolution can be interpreted as a secondary or even marginal element in the development of the avant-garde can also be demonstrated by the continued consistency of artistic thought from before and after 1917. For example, some of Rod- chenko's paintings of c.1915-16 pointed forward compositionally to the photo- graphic portraits and street scenes of 1923 and after. In fact, an anthropomorphic com- ponent can be found in most of Rodchenko's works, even in the so called abstract paint- ings, constructions and architectural pro- jects such as the design for a newspaper kiosk of 1919. It was perhaps Rodchenko's fascination with human beings rather than his rejection of them that impelled him to return again and again to schematic figures and portraits as a central theme - whether in the miniature collages of 1918-19, the linear compositions or, of course, the docu- mentary photographs and late paintings. Incidentally, Khan-Magomedov is to be thanked for drawing attention to Rod- chenko's figurative oils of the 1930s and 40s, although the reader would welcome a few more reproductions of works from this umbrageous area of the artist's auvre. Khan-Magomedov follows a similar life and work approach in his study of Vesnin, now known to many as an architect (e.g. of the Leningrad Pravda project of 1924) and a stage designer (e.g. of Alexander Tairov's production of Phidre at the Chamber Theatre, Moscow, in 1922). But Khan- Magomedov provides a much fuller account of the artist's career, including not only a long discussion of Vesnin's architectural practice of before and after the Revolution, but also an appreciation of his involvement in Lef (the group and magazine - Left Front of the Arts) in 1923-25, Inkhuk (Institute of Artistic Culture) in 1921-24, and Vkhutein (Higher State Art-Technical Institute) in the mid-1920s, where he and his colleagues (including Rodchenko) ad- vanced the principles of Constructivism. Rejecting studio art after the legendary ex- hibition '5 x 5 = 25' in Moscow in 1921, Vesnin, with Exter, Popova, Rodchenko and Stepanova, turned to industrial art and, in his particular case, to architecture so as 'to organize the new way of life' (Vesnin, p.141). Vesnin's projects for the Leningrad Pravda building, the Arcos Cor- poration headquarters in Moscow (1924), the Palace of Culture for the Proletarskii Region in Moscow (1931-37; with his brothers Viktor and Leonid), and even the Palace of Culture in Moscow (1933) manifest a remarkable consistency of style and express the consolidated Constructivist aesthetic identifiable with the Society of Contemporary Architects that Vesnin and Moisei Ginzburg headed in 1925-31. Khan-Magomedov traces a natural evolution in Vesnin's career from his early concerns with the style moderne and Neo- Classicism to Constructivism, but chooses to suspend aesthetic judgment. Some readers may resent the author's unwilling- ness to apply criteria vis a vis a particular artefact, but, ultimately, he presents us with something more important, i.e. a cor- pus of data that allow us to reconstruct the sequence of the avant-garde with clarity and accuracy. The history of the Russian-Soviet avant- garde continues to suffer from two principal distorting interpretations and, unfortu- nately, Khan-Magomedov does not redress the balance. Firstly, even in this period of apparently greater enlightenment in the Soviet Union, the avant-garde continues to be packaged and exported for Western consumption. Neither of these books ap- pears in Russian, neither is readily avail- able to the Soviet citizen, and neither is described or reviewed in the Soviet press. This repeats a pattern established by all the major Soviet monographs treating of the avant-garde, e.g. Malevich by Larisa Zhadova (in Polish, German and English, 1978-80), Tatlin by Zhadova et al. (in Hungarian, 1984), Popova by Dmitrii Sarabianov and Natalia Adaskina (in French, 1988), etc. Secondly, these mono- graphs, including Khan-Magomedov's, provide us with new documentation, but make no apology for the previous mis- treatment of the avant-garde, for the neglect and gross deformations so typical of Soviet art scholarship of the 1930s-60s. Moreover, Khan-Magomedov omits to tell us what really happened in the 1930s with the ex- clusive imposition of Socialist Realism and the virtual liquidation of the avant-garde. Meek phrases such as '[Rodchenko] took no active part in the arguments over cre- ativity, put on few exhibitions and did not look forward to the publication ofreviews' (Rodchenko, p.276) or 'Incapable of accept- ing the new ornamentation in architecture, Alexander turned to painting and drawing in the 1930s' (Vesnin, p.201) disguise the real state of affairs. It is convenient to for- get that the 'new ornamentation' silenced Rodchenko and Vesnin, killed Alexei Gan and Gustav Klucis and put many of their friends in jail. But if the avant-garde is to be truly rehabilitated in its homeland, then its painful demise as well as its concrete achievements should be described and assessed as fully and as objectively as poss- ible.
