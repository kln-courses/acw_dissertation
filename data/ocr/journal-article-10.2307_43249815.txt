<plain_text><page sequence="1">Celebrating Grace in and through the Sacrament of Their Own Lives - Listening to the Urban Marginalised Gill Goulding IBVM This paper is the result of reflection upon both my doctoral thesis and my present research. There is a four-fold structure: first an emphasis on the voice of people on the margins; this is followed by an indication of how the collection of empirical data was facilitated by listening, dialogue and conversation and the theological significance of these elements; thirdly I give a brief indication of how the mystery of God at work amongst the marginalised is a feature of certain contemporary ecclesiology; and finally I indicate how the dimension of listening may be facilitated through a contemplative imperative, how this is in accord with the spiritual tradition and is a potential source of enrichment for the church. The voice of people on the margins There are striking features about those who are marginalised. Very often they are in a position where they are not involved in the central factors which determine their lives. Dependency is an inevitable development, as they are educated to believe that others will always know best, and that some "professionals" in social security, or housing, or education or local planning, or possibly anybody other than themselves, will have the next determining voice in their lives. From the beginning then, possibly at the early age of childhood, they cease to be participatory subjects in life, but rather form objects of concern for one or another agency. Such a process ongoingly undermines the value and self-worth of an individual and progressively renders them more and more inadequate to cope with life. Considered economically irrelevant, and increasingly impoverished, marginalised individuals and groups present a shocking discontinuity to mainstream society. This process has received added momentum under successive governmental regimes, for the stress that there is no alternative has added a perverted benison upon what was conceived as necessity. Pushed to the margins by national and local government, maintained there by the attitude of police, social services and public media it takes an individual of great character to refuse to accept the negative connotations of marginality as infallible criteria for life - that such characters proliferate on the margins may be evidence of something at work there beyond the confines of our consumer 10</page><page sequence="2">society. In the 1980's a number of religious communities relocated themselves in inner city urban areas and housing estates in small communities, living out the original call of their orders to mission to the poor or prayer in the missionary situation of the inner city. Option for the poor has been consciously taken up by these religious and the experience of living amongst the poor began to change their perception of the poor, of themselves and of the institutional church. My present and previous research originated in personal experience working with such communities and marginalised individuals and groups in S cities. In Birmingham, Bristol and Brixton I worked with teams of lay people and religious in fields as diverse as prostitution, race relations, unemployment and homelessness. In Glasgow I was employed in a drug rehabilitation unit dealing with both drug abuse and the inevitable problems of HIV and AIDS. In Wolverhampton I lived and worked with a community on a peripheral housing estate whose members were endeavouring to assist community development. Now in the east of Scotland I am involved with local people and agencies on an estate in West Fife. The venues change, the problems and difficulties that individuals face remain remarkably similar. Reflecting upon my experience, I am conscious of God at work within marginalised groups and individuals in a way often embarrassingly direct and simple for our more complicated Christian formats. Most people I worked with inhabited no specific religious tradition and yet demonstrated a spiritual aliveness, openness and exploration of real depth and quality which puts many of those of us who do inhabit such traditions to shame. Since they showed no signs of being susceptible to conversion it occurred to me to ask, what can the tradition offer to them, and what more importantly, can they offer to us? To cite one example, with regard to the views of marginalised people concerning God, I would like to give you a flavour of some of the responses I received. "He's definitely not a copper." - "Not racist" - "He comes to us" "He's not stuck out from us." - "He's not poor." - "She's rich in love." - "He guides us." - "He's ready to roll up his sleeves." - "I'm not sure there is one." - "He's unwaged." - "Why does he have to be he?" - "God means existence for me. If I didn't have God in my life I'd probably have been dead a long time ago." The different themes emerging were direct and unsophisticated: the non-racist God, who doesn't receive any money; who comes to the people, and is not removed from them. There is a sense of freedom of access to this God who is not demanding of formal church commitment. Also, there is an interesting ambivalence with regard to the gender of God which gives grass roots authenticity to the on-going debate within more academic circles of the Christian community. In later interviews with individuals I asked for some general views about God, and the 11</page><page sequence="3">following is one of the replies which I received from a young black man in his mid thirties. What does God mean to me, that's a complicated one really. There's theories that people see God as something like their father, in that case I would say God was a rough mean old sod, cos that's what my father was like, but I know that God's not quite like my father. He's strong, not wishy washy. One thing I like about God is his loyalty, if he says something he'll do it I see him as a warm Lord, sounds good that doesn't it, but I like it Sometimes he must be quite grumpy too. He's also full of love, and passion. I should say too that he's a God that's in a lot of pain. The common humanity of this picture of God is poignantly conveyed in these remarks. Though the family relational bond for this man has lacked authentic affective depth yet this has not resulted in the repudiation of God. Rather, it has promoted the search for other more creative and resonant images wherein to conceive of God. Thus a "warm Lord" the sense of comfort, well-being, and affection become almost palpable in this term; combined with the reverence that "Lord" implies. Still the humour and humanity are paramount in the anthropomorphism that sometimes God might be grumpy. Also the consciousness of the pain of God was linked by this resident with the pain in the world, and an expressed certainty that in some way God was intimately involved in this reality. Very few of the people on this estate in the Midlands go to church. Indeed there appears to be a considerable amount of alienation from the church. Yet there is evident a desire to pray and to come together to celebrate the recognition of God in their lives. This led to the formulation of local peoples liturgies. They happen about once every two months and are planned and prepared by the local people in conjunction with a community of religious and lay women. They take place in a local centre on a Sunday afternoon. This local ground is a very important venue for the celebrations which have now become a regular feature of life on the estate. Individuals attend who perhaps rarely meet the community but who feel they want to be part of such a gathering. Indeed, some of the local residents describe the celebrations as their church. A notable feature of these occasions is the great freedom of those not accustomed by a tradition of liturgical involvement into certain forms and appropriate responses. This freedom is not just a significant contribution to all that occurs, but it adds a certain atmosphere of anticipation since no one is quite sure what might happen next Although celebrations are well prepared, there is an irrepressible spontaneity of response amongst the people which may undermine any restrictive formalism. In this way, the leader of the community considers the people of the estate have a lot to teach the institutional church about possible forms of worship which are more directly participative. For the community members the celebrations have had profound 12</page><page sequence="4">effects on their own understanding of faith and worship. One spoke of her own experience of a particular poignant moment during a celebration when those present were anointed by a local woman resident. I remember the time we had the anointing. It was a most moving time for me. If the person doing the anointing had been a priest I would not have been moved in the slightest. But because I know this woman, because I know some of the pain she has suffered in her life. I know too that she didn't study for five years in theology. It just touched me very deeply. I can't put it into words, I express it best through tears. Her anointing me was so deep and real for me, like God through her anointing me. That for me is what church is about And watching a stream of people go up to be anointed. That was one of the many times when I have been touched by what goes on in a celebration. Listening to views like these and living and working with people on the margins has raised key questions for me about power and powerlessness. These are issues which are particularly relevant for those of us involved in theology and therefore an integral part of the institutional church. For like it or not we do wield a degree of power by virtue of our education and training if nothing else and often we don't even realise we are doing it Yet in order to hear what is really coming from people whom we affirm God is amongst, it may mean entering into a sense of failure and powerlessness that is often very alien to us. And how hard it is to step outside our own conditioning. One sister who has lived 15 years on a Scottish council estate expressed the following view: It was only when I came to live here and when I'd been here sometime, that for the first time in my life I realised what Christianity was about, and I didn't like it. I find it very hard to face powerlessness and helplessness. All my life I've had some kind of control, some kind of security, and I still have it. I'm a sister and there's an order behind me. I live and work with people who are helpless at least in the system, not in person. What really is spirituality for me is how these people go on, going on, helping one another, are so caring, so cheerful, how they celebrate - not in church. But every little excuse we celebrate, and they have so little to celebrate with, but they do. Many on the margins become trapped in a cycle of fear and alienation. Within the dependencies which are common to all people, they may become doubly dependent because so many choices are removed from them, and the power of choice is such a basic human freedom. The power to choose divides us and true collaboration will necessitate a struggle mutually to share power over destiny. Certainly, it appears tied to contemporary work on the theology of weakness, brokenness, vulnerability and failure - the cross. The gospel story 13</page><page sequence="5">witnesses the power of God situated squarely within the reality of powerlessness. The paradox of cross and resurrection, death and life defies manipulation and challenges evasion. Here we encounter the meaning of Christian hope and simultaneously the stark reality of human suffering. As one sister working with prostitutes stated: Learning not to run from pain is a process for me. I'm aware, as I listen to others speaking, of their life's pain, of the sense of helplessness. This is what I notice most, when I'm helpless, I am vulnerable, somehow then the pain can be absorbed, integrated, productive, if I give it time, gentleness and patience. The gospel calls us to a new translation of the reality and experience of power. This may include a trusting vulnerability which of its nature transforms everyday situations releasing the possibility of change and growth. It may be a presence which exists and suffers with the people. The character of love in presence is fundamentally an offer of self to the other person, in ways that often resist the cold conceptualization of language. Indeed God's incarnate love knows no boundaries and the body of Christ is alive in the most unexpected places where humble service meets human need. It has become evident to me that in the lives and words and actions of people on the urban margins the presence of God is at work. It does appear that by virtue of their own discovery of the transcendent, some people are celebrating grace but have come to it in and through the sacrament of their own lives and this has consequent effects on those who work with them. This operative fact of grace at work within the lives of the people cannot remain in the realm of abstract theory, but must fall within the reflective consideration of praxis. The mystery is that human beings are able to grasp that the incomprehensible really exists and is active in the everyday situations of their lives. It is at this level that it achieves a dynamic evangelistic thrust in the lives of communities who live and work on the margins. It is also at this level that it presents a challenge for reflective evaluation at all levels within the churches. It is precisely at this level that the institutional church in its actual pastoral practice, may be an obstacle to such an experience of God. Here it is important to acknowledge the fallible nature of the church in its institutional form, called always to conversion and holiness and needing to incorporate into its theological reflection the reality of past failure. Listening Dialogue and Conversation Where time is expended in listening to the experience of those who live on the margins, the potential for reciprocal transformation exists. As an individual's life experience unfolds and is heard and sustained in ordinary daily contacts, the growth in self-worth, self-confidence and the ability to articulate experience of God becomes more evident. At the same time those who listen and hear are aware of themselves being 14</page><page sequence="6">evangelised as they recognise God at work amongst the people in ways very different from the forms they may have traditionally encountered. This essential mode of listening which fuels so much of what I have experienced of work among the marginalised is an easy and normal engagement with people in the affairs of their daily lives in ordinary conversation and dialogue. Dialogue implies a mutual exchange of views between diverse parties who do not fully agree, but who respect and are prepared to learn from one another. Indeed the presupposition is the openness to the possibility of modification of views through the undertaking of such converse. Dialogue presupposes real conversation unless it is to become abstruse discussion and such conversation presupposes the ability to listen, in a profound and critical way. It is important that such listening be critical in order that a priority or option for the poor whereby transformation for all participants within such converse is possible, is not hardened into an ideology which of its nature can distort and exploit the very basis of such exchange. Individuals can so often become the objects of language and a converse from which they suffer exclusion. Indeed it becomes a prominent responsibility for the church to be engaged in such conversation. Human experience occurs both within and without the institutional church, and includes the outsider - even the stormy petrel heralding the approach of troubled times. A conversation involving such potentially disturbing elements requires a flexibility which cannot be predetermined. In the concrete such interaction may be messy, provisional, inexact, frustrating and full of unintended errors. A conversation which offers hope of fulfilment in action and arises from action, tests the depths of our sincerity and commitment. In authentic conversation we are challenged at a very profound level about our language. We are challenged to examine our language, to be precise, to avoid evasive formulations, to say what we mean - what we really mean - to speak as authentically as is given us to be able to do. This process, David Tracy considers, is one in which we are in pursuit not of certainty but of understanding, and in our following of this course we have the knowledge that our interpretations also will prove inadequate and will need to be supplanted. Indeed, what may seem a weakness here is rather the strength of a reflective sense that is able to continue the process of interpretation towards an ever fuller understanding according to the signs of specific times. For Tracy, real conversation occurs only when the interlocutors move past self-consciousness and self-aggrandisement into joint reflection upon the subject matter of the conversation. Within such a dynamic interaction, there may also be the added element of what Tracy terms a "classic" employing some explicit model of Christian self- transcendence, implying some form of intense journey. Classics he cites as those texts that bear an excess and permanence of meaning, yet which always resist a definitive interpretation. Fot him there is the conviction 15</page><page sequence="7">that if the religious classics are classics at all, they can be trusted to evoke a wide range of responses, including the shock of recognition of God religiously named faith. He states that explicitly religious classic expressions will involve a claim to truth as the event of a disclosurement-concealment of the whole of reality by the power of the whole - as in some sense, a radical and finally gracious mystery. Though the classic referred to by Tracy is predominantly a text, analogously I would argue it may be used in reference to an experience, and in this case the experience of those on the margins of society. Here, just as in a text, there are demands necessitating constant interpretation and the actual experience bears a certain kind of timelessness - namely the timelessness of a classic expression radically rooted in its own historical time and calling to any individual historicity. However, it is vital that there should be ongoing reflection and indeed constant reinterpretation by later finite, historical, temporal beings who will risk asking questions and listening, critically and tactfully, in order to elicit responses to actualise and guarantee authenticity. In the same manner with regard to the experience of those on the margins, there is a primary need for ongoing reflection and critical reappropriation of that experience in the light of the church's contemporary understanding. To interact with a classic text Tracy asserts is to be subject to a generative and evocative power and to converse with difference and otherness. I would assert analogously that in contemporary society otherness and difference are primary characteristics of those who live on the margins of society. The experience here manifested is such as is apprehended by those who have chosen to live and work there as both disclosive of the reality of the mystery of God at work there, and involving a transformative truth, if approached in openness and reverence. The mystery of God at work Foremost exponents of this emphasis on the mystery of God within the context of ordinary life were Henri de Lubac and Karl Rahner whose insights permeated the deliberations of the Conciliar Fathers at Vatican II. For de Lubac, human beings are a mystery in the very essence of their natures, because of their inherent relationship with God so they can only be understood against the reference of the incomprehensible God and are always moving towards the obscurity of God. Here God's freedom is characterised by a certain gratuitousness. Human beings exist as those who are the possible and potential recipients of communication with God. If human beings in their very essence are a transcendence towards mystery, this must be an operational principle within engagement between individuals. Looking at the contemporary Christian calls to renew the face of the church, it is evident that John Paul II is not struggling politically within the modern framework of cultural debate. Rather he is seeking a transformation at the cultural root In consequence he continues to 16</page><page sequence="8">reiterate a fundamental feature of the Vatican II documents evident within his later encyclicals - namely the mystery of God at work within the world and the transcendent human dignity of every person. His vision of the laity as the embodiment of a counter-cultural force is a call to the faithful within the church to effect such change through their exemplary manner of family life and work. In a not dissimilar manner, Stanley Hauerwas appeals to those within the church to focus their efforts on actually being church and in forming a real community where effective Christian witness will be enacted. In each case the attention is focused on the faithful within the Christian community fulfilling their Christian commitment in a more exemplary fashion. Meanwhile as the forces of modernism and postmodernism swirl within contemporary Britain, individual desires seem paramount for those with the financial means or acumen to achieve them. Those outside this enclave, estranged by the very existence of those within, continue the slide towards non- person status. It is within this group, those outside the numbers of the faithful, that it is here suggested a focus might be found for the counter- cultural dynamic which both John Paul II and Hauerwas in their different ways espouse. The Pope sets the context for the action of the laity against the background of the recovery of the Christian meta- narrative, and the reality of their co-creative experience with the divine; while Hauerwas gives no clear indication of a spiritual dimension to his vision, which seems rooted in a new theological rationale for ministry, a ministry which will enable the faithful to become a more effective community of witness. I have contended that whatever consideration is given to the formation of the laity and clergy as specific tasks, a particular focus for attention with regard to the activity of God in the world must also be the lives of the marginalised themselves. For Karl Rahner the profound choice with which everyone is confronted is whether they will try to ground their own lives and cling to their own securities, or whether they will surrender their lives into the silent and often terrifying dark Mystery whom we call God. This choice is also one which faces the church in its dealings with those on the margins where God may often appear to be at work in a disconcertingly novel form. Here the question arises will the institution continue to cling to known secure ways of relating to those on the margins, ways which serve to alienate rather than include? Or will the church risk the relational mode of listening through those already established contacts on the margins? In so listening, will those in authority within the church allow the possibility of transformation and policy modification by virtue of that experience? I suggest that this deep listening mode is an underdeveloped dimension in our lives. I do not see it as an alternative to anything or everything else. It is a critical listening, leading into discerned action. An important question here involves the relationship of this proposed mode with the teaching authority of the church. A crucial issue is how to interrelate the reverence for hearing what is coming from people and 17</page><page sequence="9">being open to transformation by that, with reverencing the reality of what tradition and authority enables us to carry forward. There is a potential false polarisation here: it is not either/or but crucially, in the language of the Vatican documents, together/with. Yet it may be necessary to make a priority option for prior listening in order to guarantee the integrity of active teaching and participatory modes of being. Conceivably the official church can exercise its divine authority without nervously clutching control. The need to keep control of a process is not something that is necessarily required by an authentic authority. Both the gospel and a sane pastoral strategy might appear to exclude the need to keep control. The Contemplative Imperative Throughout all the empirical work undertaken a consistent theme has emerged that the facilitating tool for such a listening critically involves a deepening contemplative stance. The willingness of individuals and groups to cultivate the contemplative dimension of their lives. This requires an expansion of the dimension of listening involving a new depth, and an ever finer attunement. It impels towards a level of darkness, powerlessness and helplessness. This is a particularly acute need if there is to be a real attunement to what is emerging from the marginalised. In order to be able to listen at such depth, it appears important to be prepared to risk the ongoing darkness of one's own inner depths. Here in the acknowledged reality of one's own incoherence before the mystery of God at work there is the foundation for a deeper involvement with God and other human beings. From that position of essential vulnerability and powerlessness in our own contemplative depths, the clarity of resonance with others, particularly the marginalised, is peculiarly powerful. Indeed before God, and in the face of the reality of the cross, the darkness of much that appears a chaotic void on the margins begins to have some inchoate and imperceptibly conscious form. In this context also the Christian spiritual tradition has rich resources to draw upon. Here may be found encouragement for those wrestling with the darkness of powerlessness, despair and the need for discerned action. The tradition consistently substantiates the integrated nature of contemplation and action. There is abundant evidence that the deeper individuals are drawn into their own contemplative depths the more empowered they are for authentic and effective ministry. Indeed unless there is a more profound human understanding derived from that exploration of the inner ground of human existence, loving activity will tend to be superficial and deceptive. Thus there is a direct correlation between the deepening of an individual's interior life and the expansion of the capacity to understand and serve others, particularly the most marginalised. The life of contemplative payer is first of all life and life implies openness, growth and development. The heart of such contemplation is 18</page><page sequence="10">always beyond knowledge and reasoned understanding, beyond systems and explanations, beyond our very self; for it reaches out to the knowledge and experience of the transcendent inexpressible God. It is realised only by the gift of awareness, an awareness that will always be incomplete and partial but which is an awakening to the truth of God within all reality. This awakening has a deep resonance in the inmost core of the spirit. The path of the interior journey appears to have a cyclical dynamic. The risk embraced at the beginning is prompted by involvement with those on the urban margins. Openness, temporal commitment, provisionality and messiness are features common to both interior journeying and exterior involvement. Yet the willingness to embark upon this course with the inevitable exposure of vulnerability leads into a mysterious discovery of authentic selftiood. Along the way, loneliness may be transformed into fruitful solitude while the desire for contemplative prayer deepens. As the path becomes darker and more obscure, the inner emptiness may be reflected in the reality of the external situation. Yet the space created within allows a more profound listening to marginalised individuals and apprehension of the divine initiative. This interior emptiness is the seed ground for mature growth but it can appear as the prelude to disintegration. This fear prompts that acknowledged need for purification, an active asceticism into which an individual is drawn by a deepening attachment to the imitation of Christ and the discernment of any motivation for action. A sense of weakness and inadequacy remain upon the journey but ultimately there arises a deep personal integration in an attentive watchful listening of the heart, and an ongoing free creative consent to the divine imperative. This freedom is rooted in and nourished by the grace-gift of humility. This humility involves great limpidity, as such it facilitates awareness of the presence of God in others. Thus the heart of the interior journey orientates the individual back to that risky involvement with others but with an enhanced ability to listen and respond to the presence of God at work amongst people. This has direct implications both for those who work with the marginalised, and also for the church. This is a spiritual hermeneutic for the urban margins. It is rooted in the experience of interaction with the marginalised. Such experience reflectively evaluated propels individuals towards risking the path of their interior journey and ultimately this path leads back to deeper involvement with the marginalised accompanied by an increased perception of the presence of God at work there. Such an interpretation presents a challenge both for individuals and the church: for individuals to risk the engagement upon their own interior journey; for the church, to both encourage that individual engagement and to pray for that grace gift of humility to pervade all institutional life such that there might be a more receptive attitude to the mysterious presence of God outwith the present ecclesiastical boundaries. If this spiritual hermeneutic is to be taken seriously as a potential dynamic for the 19</page><page sequence="11">church at the close of the twentieth century it has serious implications for all engaged in ministry within the church. It prompts the encouragement of the contemplative dimension as a foremost priority in any training for ministry. It gives prominence to engagement with the marginalised as a keynote ministry within the church beneficial for members in a reciprocal dynamic of transformation. It requires a re- engagement with the classical spiritual tradition and a reappropriation of the treasures therein for contemporary availability. It may cause the church to be reinvigorated by this dual engagement with its own spiritual depths in the interior lives of its members, and its own renewed tradition; and with the contemporary manifestation of the presence of God amongst the marginalised. Real reconciliation between the church and those on the urban margins will not occur until there is a valuing of the experience of God already at work there.</page></plain_text>
