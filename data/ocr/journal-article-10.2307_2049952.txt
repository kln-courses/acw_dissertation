<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Content of Cultural Continuity in India W. NORMAN BROWN ()nNE OF THE problems recurring in the Buddhist Pali Texts is the question of what it is that transmigrates. Buddhism accepts as axiomatic the doctrine of re- birth, a process of "renewal of becomings" until the attainment of complete knowledge, whereupon the process terminates. At the same time, the Pali texts are committed to the doctrine that there is no soul. Te two doctrines, held simultane- ously, presented a difficulty of which the Buddhist monks were well aware. If there is no soul, no Ego, no self, and yet rebirth is a fact, what is reborn? Of the many passages bearing upon the parts of this problem, one of the best known is that in which the Venerable Nagasena expounds the No-Soul doctrine to King Milinda. Nagasena had remarked to the king that, though he was called Nagasena, this was merely a convenient designation, an appellation, and any other designation would have done as well. there was no essential Nagasena, no Ego Nagasena. This was more than the king could understand. "If there is no Ego," he objected, "who furnishes you monks with robes, medicine, and your other needs, who uses these things? Who observes the precepts, who undertakes meditation, who does evil? Without an Ego there can be no merit, no demerit; good and evil deeds can have no fruit. There can be no teacher. When you tell me that your fellow monks address you as Nagasena, what is this Nagasena? Is the hair of your head Nagasena?" "No, your majesty!" "The hair of your body?" "No!" "The nails, skin, teeth?" and he catalogued some thirty parts of the body. "Is it form, sensation, perception, the pre- dispositions, consciousness, or all of them together, or something besides them?" Al- ways the answer was "No." Then the king said to Nagasena, "You are telling me a lie. There is no Nagasena." In reply to the king, Nagasena resorted to a parable, using as its subject the chariot in which the king said he came to Nagasena's presence. "What is this chariot?" asked Nagasena. "Is it the pole, or the axle, or the wheels, or the chariot-body, or the banner- staff, or the yoke, or the reins, or the goad, or all of them together?" Each time the king answered, "No." "Then," said Nagasena, "king though you are, you are lying to me. There is no chariot!" Thus refuted, the king denied that he had lied, and then conceded that the word "chariot" was only a term, an appellation, a convenient desig- nation, a name for all the parts mentioned. "Similarly," pointed out Nagasena, "must you understand the word 'Nagasena.' It is but an appellation, a convenient designa- tion. But in the absolute sense there is no Nagasena to be found here."'

C Warren, Buddhism in Translations (Cambridge, Mass., 1909), pp. I30-I33. 427</page><page sequence="2">428 W. NORMAN BROWN Later, in the same text, King Milinda asked Nagasena the question which naturally followed: "If there is no Ego, what is it that is born in the next existence?" "Your majesty," replied Nagasena, "it is name and form that is born in the next existence." By "name and form" (ndmaripa) the Pali means "individuality." Yet the individuality in the next existence, Nagasena went on to explain, is not the same in- dividuality as that in this existence; "But with the individuality of this existence, your majesty, one does a deed-it may be good or it may be wicked-and by reason of this deed another individuality is born into the next existence." "Reverend sir," asked the king, "if it is not the same individuality that is born into the next existence, is not one freed from one's evil deeds?" "If one were not born into another existence," answered Nagasena, "one would be freed from one's evil deeds; but, your majesty, inasmuch as one is born into another existence, therefore is one not freed from one's evil deeds." Still puzzled, King Milinda asked for an illustration, and Nagasena gave him several, including the following: "Your majesty, it is as if a man were to buy from a cowherd a pot of milk, and were to leave it with the cowherd, and go off, thinking he would come the next day and take it. And on the next day it were to turn into sour cream; and the man were to come back, and say, 'Give me the pot of milk.' And the other were to show him the sour cream; and the first man were to say, 'I did not buy sour cream from you. Give me the pot of milk.' And the cowherd were to say, 'While you were gone, your milk turned into sour cream;' and they, quarrelling, were to come to you. Whose cause, your majesty, would you sustain?" "That of the cowherd, reverend sir." "And why?" "Because, in spite of what the man might say, the one sprang from the other." "In exactly the same way, your majesty, although the individuality which is born into the next existence is different from the individuality which is to end at death, nevertheless, it is sprung from it. Therefore is one not freed from one's evil deeds?" 2 In other passages the simile of milk is extended to include the successive transfor- mations into sour cream, butter, or ghee. The texts illustrate the point that there is continuity and causal connection, though not identity, of individuality. And now arises a third question: what causes individuality to be reborn? In the Buddhist doctrine of the Chain of Dependent Origination, individuality is said to de- pend upon consciousness (Pali, Ovinfina; Sanskrit, viftn-na), and the Buddha is repre- sented as saying in the Mahanidanasutta of the Digha Nikaya, "Were consciousness not to descend in the maternal womb, name and form, that is individuality, would not consolidate in the maternal wo-mb." And he goes on to say that were conscious- ness to be severed from a child, name and form would not attain growth, increase, and development. "Accordingly," says he, "we have in consciousness the occasion, the origin, and the dependence of individuality. ... Verily this individuality coupled with consciousness is all there is to be born, or to grow old, or to die, or to leave 2 Warren, pp. 237-238.</page><page sequence="3">CULTURAL CONTINUITY IN INDIA 429 one existence, or to spring up in another. It is all that is meant by any affirmation, predication, or declaration we may make concerning anybody. It constitutes knowl- edge's field of action. And it is all that is reborn to appear in its present shape."3 In short, we can see that consciousness is the only invariable, the one unalterable element, in the Pali Buddhist doctrine of rebirth. I have used this bit of Buddhist doctrinal exposition because it presents a figurative analogy to the history of civilized man in India. Since the third millennium B. C. India has had a highly developed civilization, and we can see that this has had a con- tinuity through successive periods with many variations from then to the present. The variation has often been great, so that today's phenomenon looks little like its ante- cedent, though caused by it, two or three or four thousand years ago, while there are also many differentiations in separate localities. Yet there must be something which in each successive periodic reincarnation of the civilization has caused the new exist- ence of the civilization, something which in terms of the Buddhist doctrinal analogy corresponds to consciousness. To identify that something, assuming that it really is present, is the problem which I suggest deserves our attention. Its identification would contribute to our understanding of the process of Indian civilization, its past and its present, and give some hint, however slight or vague, of its future. The problem is essentially akin to that which Robert Redfield investigated in terms of the Great Tra- dition and the Little Tradition, or M. N. Srinivas treated under the heading of Sanskritization, or Milton Singer has recently been exploring as the relation between Text and Context. I hasten to say that I do not claim to have identified the vitalizing element, but I do wish to make a few remarks on the problem and shall be satisfied if I can help to define it more fully, even though I cannot achieve its solution. The basic material for studying this problem is the mass of data available to us concerning the nature and development of civilization in India, the totality of items which reappear in altered form in the sequence of periods. Scholars have been as- sembling, synthesizing, and analyzing such material since the time of Christian Lassen, who published the first edition of his Indische Alterthumskunde in I847. Other treat- ments have been L. D. Barnett's Antiquities of India in I914, A. A. Macdonell's Indids Past in I927, L. Renou and J. Filliozat's L'Inde Classique in I947/I953. The most recent is A. L. Basham's The Wonder that Was India, which appeared in I954. Such works easily establish the wide range of fields in which the continuity exists, the many aspects of life in which it is found. These works and the specific researches on which they are based show us as well the great length of the continuity. There are, for example, certain items which appear throughout the entire 4500 years of Indian civilization from the period of the Harappa culture in Western India in the third millennium B. C. to the present. Phallic worship is one of them; the use of the swastika symbol is another. A stylistic tradition in sculp- ture is still another, as Stella Kramrisch has pointed out. Though we have no inter- pretable data for ascertaining religious dogmas in the Harappa period, we see items in that culture which seem to indicate beliefs or practices similar to some now cur- rent. The pipal tree appears to have been honored or valued by the Harappa people; it is sacred today. The Harappans depicted on their seal-amulets the bull and the 3 Warren, pp. 207-208.</page><page sequence="4">430 W. NORMAN BROWN tiger, both of which have religious connotations today. They portray a wide variety of hybrid animals; similar animal hybridization continues in Hindu religious art. They presumably honored, perhaps worshipped, a three-faced anthropomorphic being whom they show seated in a yoga posture and surrounded by animals, recalling the god Shiva's aspect as the meditative ascetic deity and another of his aspects as Pasupati, "Lord of Creatures." Unfortunately, we know nothing of the Harappa people's social structure and political organization, nor their language, nor their thought, and this, too, in spite of the fact that they left a script. At a later period, when the Aryans had arrived in India and were producing the Vedic collections, in the second half of the second millennium B. C., roughly between I500 and iooo, we see other cultural items that have had a series of metamorphoses in the interval down to the present. The high value set upon the cow is one, which by the beginning of the Christian era had led to the doctrine of the cow's sanctity or in- violability. The joint family system seems to have existed in the time of the Rig Veda; it is still the typical Hindu pattern. A special view of truth appears in the Rig Veda also, where it is invested with a kind of magic power that should probably be con- sidered the starting point of many later conceptions of the power of truth, down to Gandhi's mystical theory about satydgraha. The recorded history of speculative thought in India begins in the Rig Veda. Its start seems to have been the myth of the god Indra who slays the demon Vrtra, releases the cosmic waters which were pregnant with the sun, and thus sets the stage for creation of the cosmos and de establishment of order in it. Out of this cosmological myth philosophy seems to have grown, with its subsequent manifold developments. The language of the Rig Veda, Sanskrit in its earliest form, served, as it developed into Classical Sanskrit, Pali, and the Prakrits, as the dominant vehicle of thought and culture in India until English superseded it in the nineteenth century, along with the body of western thought which it introduced. Even so Sanskrit is still remarkably alive and significant to Hindus. A half a millennium after the Vedic period, Jainism and Buddhism put organized ascetism on a widely respected popular basis, where it still stands. These two faiths also promoted ahinisd, "non-injury of living creatures," which remains to the present the most important ethical principle of Hinduism. They also accepted the joint doc- trine of karma and rebirth, retribution for one's deeds in future existences, a doctrine already appearing in late Vedic thought, and popularized it until it was accepted as an axiom and continues to be so accepted in modern Hindu India. At about the beginning of the Christian era the social institution of caste, the ra- tionalization of which was foreshadowed in Vedic literature as early as in the Purusa- sulkta of the Rig Veda (io. 90), had been developed and was firmly established. With two millennia of development it is still the basic feature of Hindu social structure. It would be possible to compile a catalogue of many hundreds of cultural items appearing in ancient Indian civilization which are then reborn or at least reappear in always altering fashion in succeeding periods during centuries, even millennia. Such a catalogue doubtless would not answer the question of what has given Indian civili- zation its special character and vitality, the element corresponding to the "conscious- ness" of Buddhist thought, without which new existences would not come into being, existences which, though new, are yet dependent upon preceding existences. Nor is that element likely to be identified even if we could dassify the details of Indian civilization into categories by ethnic source, that is determine which were developed</page><page sequence="5">CULTURAL CONTINUITY IN INDIA 431 by Indo-Aryans, or by Dravidians, or by some other ethnic group, hoping in this way to identify a given people as the author of characteristic Indian civilization. When I have asked Indians their thoughts on the question of a vitalizing element in Indian civilization I have always had the answer that such an element certainly exists, but I have found difference of opinion as to what that element is. As simple an answer as I have ever received is that it is a special feeling for the sanctity of water. Such a feeling can be deduced from the elaborate bathing and drainage systems of town planning and architecture in the Harappa culture, the reverence for the Cosmic Waters in the Rig Veda, the use of ceremonial ablution in Hinduism, the veneration of streams and springs, and other lesser religious practices or taboos associated with water. Oftener than any other the answer is that the determining element is the Indian concern with religio-philosophical investigation and its application to life. This is the search for metaphysical truth, the nature of the cosmos, of god, of the human soul, and of the Absolute and man's relation to it. The answer is in line with the common In- dian view today that India throughout its history, down to and including the present, has been engrossed in the quest for the spiritual-in contrast with the West, which is considered to be preoccupied with "materialism." Aside from this bit of cultural chauvinism there is support for the general idea of India's especially intensive interest in religio-philosophic activity in the long history of speculative thought and religious teaching, so voluminously recorded in Indian literature from its beginings in the Rig Veda, its blossoming in the Upanishads and in the Jain and Buddhist scriptures, and its wide ramification and varying development thereafter until our own day, witness Gandhi and Vinoba Bhave as contemporary illustrations; others could be named. Some Indians, on being pressed further, have reduced their stress on this facet of Indian civilization and instead have placed it on the prevalence of tolerance, and pointed to the wide, often contradictory, yet tolerated, variation in Hinduism of in- tellectual dogma, and the accompanying latitudinarianism in views of human behavior. All these variations are accorded status in orthodox Hinduism. This latter answer, or at least such a type of answer, seems to me to advance our investigation, but not to satisfy it. It carries us beyond material productions in the arts, literature, and sciences; beyond skills, customs, political institutions, social institu- tions, social change and development, varying norms, and thought forms; into the field of values and attitudes, and thus to the basis of behavior patterns. Possibly we can take another step forward by looking at one of the values of Hin- duism more closely. I am thinking of duty, and the unusual stress put upon correct action. Again, we can say nothing about this in the Harappa culture, but we can see it in the Rig Veda and still more markedly in the ritual worship described in the Yajur Veda and the Brahmanias. In this ritual every detail must be perfect and the priests are a highly trained fraternity with specialized duties painstakingly learned and per- formed with the finest exactitude. The doctrine of rebirth and karma, the most char- acteristic of all Indian religious teachings, employs this notion to its fullest. Every person's slightest action is a determinant of his future state, and the literature in thou- sands of passages points out in minute detail the correspondence between deed and result. In caste practice, behavior is the primary consideration; it must always accord with prescription, not only with respect to important matters such as marriage selection and birth and death ceremonies, but also with respect to such small ones as eating,</page><page sequence="6">432 W. NORMAN BROWN speaking to or approaching others, or even the style of tonsure. Behavior far out- weighs dogma in Hinduism, which may vary widely even for members of the same caste without objection from one's fellows. But not so with action! Infringement there results in penalty, which may extend to expulsion from the caste, social death. Correct or right behavior is viewed as a personal responsibility or duty with a most significant meaning to Hindus, Buddhists, and Jains. Particular application of the idea of duty appears as early as in the Rig Veda. There it starts with the notion that our cosmos contains two opposing forces; that of ordered operation, progress, and har-. monious cooperation of the parts; and that of disorder, chaos, destruction. The universe in which we live is held to operate under a code or set of principles to keep it going, and this code, this body of cosmic truth or order, has the name satya or rta. But disorder, anti-order, known as anrta, is ever beating at our universe, tending to disrupt or destroy it. To keep our universe operating smoothly, every being in it has a function. Gods have their specific functions; human beings have their functions. No two gods have the same function, and human beings' functions also differ. Each god and each human must assiduously devote himself to his function. If he fails in per- forming it, to that extent the operation of the universe is impaired. The word for this individual function is vrata (R.V. 9.JI2), and so important is the concept that in post-Vedic times the word comes to mean a solemn, religious vow, to be undertaken with great seriousness and observed with unflagging zeal. Human duty is differentiated in the Rig Veda for the four great classes of society: the Brahmana or priest; the Rajanya or Ksatriya, the temporal ruler or warrior; the Vais'ya or commoner, peasant and artisan; and the 8fldra or slave. The Brahmana celebrates the ritual, first performed at the time of creation by the gods, and this ritual gives the gods the help they need to counteract the destructive force of evil. The Ksatriya patronizes the sacrifice and protects it from harm. The Vaisya produces the economic means needed by the ruler and the Brahmana. The 8fidra does menial service for the others in their activities. In R.V. Io.9o, creation is described figuratively as the primordial sacrifice by the gods of a being called Purusa, "male," a symbolic repre- sentation of all the materials needed to produce the universe. As he is dismembered, the parts of his body become the parts of the universe. ITere it is said that the Brah- mana came from Purusa's mouth, the RIjanya from his arms, the Vaisya from his loins, and the gfldra from his feet. The symbolism is obvious. After the caste system with its practise of endogamy and its ideas of pollution, emerged by the beginning of the Christian era or earlier, it was artificially encased by orthodox Hindu priestly thought into the four-class system of Vedic society. Manu, author of the great and well-known legal text, ascribes the multiplicity of castes to mixture of the four original social groups, an evil practise in his opinion. Neverthe- less, Hinduism eventually applied to the whole caste system the rationalizing theory that each caste has a specific function in the universe which it is duty bound to per- form. Each individual member of a caste has as his personal duty that of fulfilling the function of his caste; if he avoids it, he commits sin. Though this kind of rationalization is both bad anthropology and bad history, not to speak of dubious metaphysics, it has nevertheless had deep influence and led to im- portant consequences, especially when it became associated with the doctrine of karma and rebirth. First, as we have already noticed, reward for doing one's duty or punish- ment for failure to do it were held to be experienced in rebirth and to determine</page><page sequence="7">CULTURAL CONTINUITY IN INTDIA 433 the conditions of rebirth. Secondly, one's present caste status was considered to be the consequence of deeds done in previous existences. Birth in a high caste was a reward, birth in a low caste a punishment. Furthermore, the intellectual and spiritual, some- times even the moral, endowments of a person at birth were regarded as a concomitant of his caste status. Hence a low caste person was expected to have a less sophisticated view of god, society, life, and morality than a high caste person. That was part of his general lowly estate. He must therefore not be expected to comprehend what the high caste person was equipped to comprehend. So, too, standards of behavior were viewed as different. Normal conduct for a low caste man might be sin for a Brahman. All this was understood to be in accord with cosmic law. It constituted an acceptance of relativity concerning human capacity and human behavior that is the basis of the Hindu tolerance mentioned above. There was no such thing as a single universal standard of duty. Not all people were or could rationally be expected to comprehend the same ideas or to live by the same codes. Each caste could quite legitimately frame its own rules for fulfilling its caste function-within limits, of course; that is, so long as the observance of them did not interfere with another caste in the fulfilling of its function and the observance of its rules. This was the adjustment that made it possible for contradictory doctrines and conflicting codes to dwell side by side in peaceful coexistence. Divergency of duty was expected, accepted, and legitimized on what might seem to others to be a scale of astounding amplitude. Other large or basic values of Indian civilization might be cited for examination, such as truth and ahinsJ, which have already been mentioned, or the attitude toward law as something not made by man, not even by the king-the Brhad Aranyaka Upanishad (I. 4. I4) says law is "king over the king"-not invented by kings or by the gods or even by God, but existing before and independently of them all. Should we think that any such value or a whole set of values has constituted the feature giving Indian civilization its vitality throughout history? I repeat that I should not want to make a positive asseveration that it has, but I think the possibility may at least be worthy of consideration, and, in that case, the identification, description, and application of these values deserve deep study. In viewing Indian civilization I am reminded of the banyan tree, a fig tree, in Sanskrit called nyagrodha, a word which means "the down-grower." Though this tree begins life with a single trunk rising from a minute seed, its wide-spreading branches send down air roots, some of which themselves reach the ground, penetrate it, and become secondary trunks, occasionally to rival in size the first trunk. Thus the tree may come to shade an acre or more of ground. One can imagine a banyan tree of such age and such coverage that it may have a number of secondary trunks capable of being confused at first glance with the primary trunk. Such, it seems to me, has been the history of Indian civilization. It arose from roots in the subsurface culture of India, the material of Redfield's Little Tradition or Singer's Contextual. It grew up and spread out into the Great Tradition and the Textual. As it grew it sent out branches and these sent down air roots, some of which returned into the soil, and so became the means of communication between subsurface roots and above-ground branches. This was always a two-way communication, though a selective one with respect to the items communicated, implementing a constant process of mutual feed and feedback, of reciprocal input and output. But the animating principle of the Nyagrodha is not easy to discern. There is a</page><page sequence="8">434 W. NORMAN BROWN passage mn the Chandogya Upanishad (6. 12) touching on that point. The setting is that of Svetaketu ArunLeya being instructed by his father Uddalaka, after Svetaketu has come back from his twelve-year course of study, conceited and proud, thinking that he had mastered all knowledge. Uddilaka sets out to teach him something he has not learned, namely, how to know the one thing that gives knowledge of all other things. This is, it happens, the atman (Soul), which permeates all beings, is uniform, invariable, and indestructible. He teaches partly by parable, and one of the parables concerns the Nyagrodha fig tree, the banyan. Uddalaka speaks to his son: "Bring hither a fig from there." "Here it is, sir." "Split it." "It is split, sir." "What do you see there?" "These rather fine seeds, sir." "Please split one of these." "It is split, sir." "What do you see there?" "Nothing at all, sir." Then Uddilaka said to him, "Verily, my dear, the finest essence which you do not perceive-verily, my dear, from that finest essence this great nyagrodha tree thus arises." And he concludes by saying that that essence is the essence of the whole world, of gvetaketu himself; that it is gvetaketu. Perhaps any effort of ours to find the seed that has been the vitalizing essence of Indian civilization, its principle of consciousness, to use the Buddhist doctrinal analogy, may be as futile as 9vetaketu's effort to see the essence of the banyan tree. Such a failure might still not convince an inquirer that a vitalizing element was not there, nor prevent the curious from seeking for it. gvetaketu, of course, had only his eyes with which to look.</page></plain_text>
