Introduction The Shechemite deity (or deities?) El/Baal Berith (Judg 8:33; 9:4, 46) has attracted far too little attention from the scholarly community, especially when one considers that here we have data that are intimately connected to the development of ancient Israelite religion, not to mention the reconstruction of the concept of covenant in ancient Israel. The one notable exception to the dearth of probing work on this deity was R. E. Clements's treatment of Baal Berith that appeared twenty-eight years ago.' Much water has passed under the bridge since, especially contributions to our understanding of ancient Israelite religion. Covenantal studies have also undergone a dramatic reanalysis result- ing from additional extrabiblical evidence and, even more so, from major reassessments of the "covenant centrality"2 position that had emerged as a con- sensus in the 1950s and 1960s. Yet no one has bothered to reexamine the deity Baal Berith in light of the revolution that has occurred in covenantal studies since Clements penned his treatment.3 I would like to thank the Society of Biblical Literature and the Ecumenical Theological Sem- inary in Detroit for giving this paper the 1994 Mitchell Dahood Memorial Award in Biblical Hebrew and Northwest Semitics. I am also very grateful for various travel grants to research collec- tions provided through the office of the Vice President for Research at the University of Georgia. A portion of this paper was delivered at the 1992 annual meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research. 1 R. E. Clements, "Baal-Berith of Shechem,"JSS 13 (1968) 21-32. 2 This terminology is from R. Oden, "The Place of Covenant in the Religion of Israel," in Ancient Israelite Religion: Essays in Honor of Frank Moore Cross (ed.'P. D. Miller, Jr., P. D. Han- son, and S. D. McBride; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987) 437. 3 To illustrate this point one need only look at the most recent full-length treatment on covenant by E. W. Nicholson (God and His People: Covenant and Theology in the Old Testament [Oxford: Clarendon, 1986] 46, 151), which contains only the briefest mention of Baal Berith. 401</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Biblical Literature There is not a great deal of biblical data to work with when it comes to this deity (a mere three occurrences). The present paper attempts to reassess the identity and function of the deity/deities El/Baal Berith primarily from the extra-biblical data. There are some significant archaeological and extrabiblical textual data which need to enter into the discussion. II. Past Scholarship on the Relation between El Berith and Baal Berith Few scholars have tried to identify the deity (or deities) with any precision. W. F. Albright, in his 1941 Ayer Lectures, thought that Baal Berith was an appellation of the god Hauron.4 G. Schmitt and P. Craigie both suggested that El Berith might be "a reference to the Indo-Iranian god Mitra in Semitic form."5 In contrast, there is a good deal of speculation about the relation between Baal Berith and El Berith. Some scholars favor two separate deities. J. A. Sog- gin saw two different deities corresponding to the two sanctuaries at Shechem.6 Clements, on the other hand, called the two-sanctuary hypothesis "most improbable" and suggested that one could explain the existence of the two titles "as a consequence of a movement in which an earlier widespread El religion gave place to a more active Baal religion in Northern Palestine and Syria."7 Others have argued that Baal Berith and El Berith are one and the same.8 In this case some scholars give primacy to Baal while others see El as the pri- mary deity. J. Gray suggested that Baal Berith was the god whose shrine was at Shechem. The title El-Berith in Judg 9:46 resulted from "the substitution of 'El' for 'Baal' ... due to scribal orthodoxy."9 Clements stated that "the title El- Berith was simply an alternative for Baal-Berith, with El used in a purely appellative sense."10 Because of the mention of the god Hadad in one of the 4 W.

Mazar concluded that our deity "was a chthonic deity, possibly Hadad, also known as Baal."12 In contrast, L. E. Toombs and G. E. Wright preferred to reconstruct "El- bertt-that is, a deity of the Patriarchal El tradition who was especially related to the 'covenant'" with ba'al berit in Judg 9:4 developing secondarily.'3 F. M. Cross has argued that we are dealing with an original epithet of the Canaanite deity El, who was known at Shechem as both 'el 'elohe yisrd'el, "'El, the god of (the Patriarch Jacob) Israel" and 'el bacal berit, "'El lord of Covenant."'4 The present article will argue for the preeminence of El Berith after a closer examination of the function of the deity. III. The Function of El/Baal Berith The way in which the deity functioned is directly related to the question of identity. How did El Berith, "the god of the covenant," and/or Baal Berith, "the lord of the covenant," function in the treaty itself? This is a crucial question for assessing the history of the concept of covenant in ancient Israel. Two viable options have been proposed: (a) the deity acted as the guardian or witness of the treaty or (b) the deity acted as a party to the covenant. Mazar opts for the first, stating that the deity "was the patron of the treaty (El-berith or Baal- berith) that had been concluded between Laba'yu and the chiefs of the hetero- geneous population of the Shechem region."'5 Other scholars feel that the full force of the terms "god of .. ." and "lord of .. ." must imply something more.16 The Role of Deities as Witnesses and/or Guardians of the Treaty The first of these two proposed functions is by far the better-attested role for deities in the ancient Near East. As H. Tadmor writes with reference to the 11 The god Hadad/Addu appears as a theophoric element in three personal names on a cuneiform list found at Shechem. See E. F. Campbell, "Two Cuneiform Tables From Shechem," in G. E. Wright, Shechem: The Biography of a Biblical City (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1964) 208-13; W. F. Albright, "A Teacher to a Man of Shechem about 1400 B. C.," BASOR 86 (1942) 28-31. 12 B. Mazar, Biblical Israel: State and People (ed. S. Ahituv; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1992) 50. It is unclear to me why Mazar would think of Hadad as a chthonic deity unless he is thinking of Baal- Hadad's descent to the underworld in the Baal Cycle. 13 L. E. Toombs and G. E. Wright, "The Fourth Campaign at Balatah (Shechem)," BASOR 169(1963)31. 14 F. M. Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973) 49.

This was the normal role of the gods. Although seldom emphasized in discussion of Yahweh's covenant with the Israelites, it should be noted that Yahweh too plays the role of the guarantor of the treaty. As noted by S. Loewenstamm, the covenant in Jer 34:18 is made "before Yahweh" as guarantor similar to the treaty mentioned in Sefire I A:7-12, which is made "before" a list of deities who also serve as guarantors.20 Following this line of interpretation, which is certainly favored by the majority of scholars, El/Baal Berith's function would be as the witness or guaran- tor of the covenant between two peoples. According to our traditional sources, there is no reference to any battle of Shechem. The author(s) and/or editor(s) of this material leave open the possibility that this was due to a covenant that was made between the Israelites and the Shechemites (cf. Joshua 8). The Role of a Deity as a Treaty Partner The Hebrew Bible describes Yahweh entering into a covenant relationship with his people, especially in the Deuteronomistic and related material. Yet outside of the Bible there are very few parallels in the ancient Near East of 17 H. Tadmor, "Treaty and Oath in the Ancient Near East: A Historian's Approach," in Humanizing America's Iconic Book (ed. G. M. Tucker and D. A.

Wiseman, The Vassal-Treaties of Esarhaddon (London: British School of Archaeology, 1959) 81. S. A. Kaufman also writes: "the etymological and phonetic evidence, as well as the late occurrence of ade in late Akkadian only, almost certainly precludes an Akkadian origin for this political term" (The Akkadian Influences on Aramaic [Assyriological Stud- ies 19; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974] 33). 20 S.

Some scholars have overstated the uniqueness of the Israelite phenomenon. To name but two among many, M. Weinfeld and A. Falkenstein expressed the opinion that the idea of a covenant between a deity and a people is unknown to us outside of ancient Israel.21 Such a conclusion seems rash to readers who have immersed themselves in the world of the ancient Near East and know how the deities permeate every facet of life. In this sense, all the world is a covenant. J. Sasson states the obvi- ous: "While it is true that there is scant evidence for treaty making between a god and a (non-Hebrew) people, it is worth keeping in mind that every time a king or ruler made an offering to a god (sacrifice or votive), there obtained a mutual covenant between them [the gods] (and the king's flock)."22 But this will not do for those who have their minds made up that the Israelite covenantal experience between God and his people is simply unattested in the ancient Near East. Thus, I offer for consideration the following five texts, which do seem to mention very specifically the notion of a deity playing the role of treaty partner, although each of these texts has been the subject of some debate. (1) The first text is an early Sumerian text that McCarthy calls "an oddity among the religious conceptions of Sumer."23 The "reform text" of Urukagina, the ensi of Lagash, who was seen as the steward or employee of the god Ningirsu, mentions that "Urukagina made this covenant with Ningirsu (KA.KA e-da-kes) that the powerful should not harm the widow and the orphan" (Uruk- agina Cyl B, 12:23-28). There is a slight debate over the exact translation of KA.KA e-da-kes. F. Thureau-Dangin first translated the phrase "Mit Ningirsu hat Urukagina diesen Vertrag geschlossen,"24 but M. Lambert's lengthy study rendered "Urukagina fit sceller par Ningirsu cette declaration."25 Most scholars have sided with Thureau-Dangin in seeing a reference to the making of a covenant or agreement.26 My translation above follows a similar analysis of this text by Piotr Steinkeller.27 21 M. Weinfeld, "berith," TDOT 2.278; Falkenstein (oral communication to K. Baltzer, The Covenant Formulary [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1971] 90 n. 3). Cf. F.

The Urukagina text has also been recognized by M. Buss ("The Covenant Theme in Historical Perspective," VT 16 [1966] 502-4) and Kitchen ("Egypt, Ugarit, Qatna and Covenant," 462). 27 Steinkeller, personal communication. Compare also H.

D. Sperling, Marduk says the following: "That prince shall rule all the lands. For I alone, all you gods, have a covenant with him (ittisu salmdku)."29 Sperling and M. Held have both documented the regular use of the verb saldmu for political alliances and covenants.30 The related forms salimu, salmu, salmutti, saldmu, sulmu, and so forth all have some notion of rec- onciliation through peace making.31 S. Parpola has recently argued that "the verb saldmu 'to make peace' could equally well connote 'to seek detente' as 'to surrender."'32 One could object that Sperling's translation, "I have a covenant with him," is overtranslating the Akkadian to bring out the covenantal connection. It is true that salimu can refer to reconciliation with the gods (cf. CAD S, 102). Nevertheless, the treaty nuances and connotations unmistakably underlie any theological overtones.33 (3) From the library of Ashurbanipal we have a Neo-Assyrian text known as Tablet K2401 (NAP 3.3).34 Early interpreters, such as Strong and M. Jastrow, described the text as a collection of oracles having to do with historical military campaigns.35 Jastrow also argued that the oracles were accompanied by certain priestly rituals such as sacrifice and even the drinking of "holy water."6 More recently, these texts have received attention by scholars who have classified them as prophetic texts due to the mention of Ishtar of Arbela (Obv. col 2. line 33).37 Yet as early as 1914 S. Langdon argued that what we have in K2401 is a 28 R. Borger, "Gott Marduk und Gott-Konig uulgi als Propheten: Zwei prophetische Texte," BO 28 (1971) 11 (Col. III 20'-22'). 29 S. D.

Scholars usually translate the term as "oracle of well-being" (so Huffmon), "Heilsorakel" (so K. Hecker), or the like.39 As with the Marduk "prophecy" text, it seems that once again we have covenant language. anina dAsur andku killaka assime Now I AsSur have heard your [Esarhaddon's] cry...

A covenant interpretation is supported by the recent work on this text by N. Lohfink, K. Deller, R. DiVito, and W. Moran, who have concluded that the reference to the sulmu (which is placed before the gods and the statue (pre- sumably of Ashur) (2.7, 28) refers to "some sort of ceremonial" linked to a covenant between the deity Assur and King Esarhaddon.40 Lohfink and Deller situate Assur's covenant with Esarhaddon and the people of Assyria during an internal political crisis.41 M. Nissinen has recently argued that this covenant between Esarhaddon and the deity served to legitimate the king's rule in the context of power struggles within the Neo-Assyrian empire.42 Special note should be made of the expression tuppi ade. While Huffmon translates this phrase "the sworn tablet of Asshur," it makes better sense not to lose the force 38 S. Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar (Oxford: Clarendon, 1914) 136. Langdon mistakenly viewed the treaty as being with foreigners. 39 See Huffmon, "Prophecy in the Ancient Near East," 700; K. Hecker, "Spriiche an K6nig Assurbanipal, K. 2401," Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments (Giitersloh: Mohn, 1986) 2.60, following AHW, s.v. sulmu. R. A. DiVito, in an unpublished paper entitled "A Literary- and Form- Critical Study of Neo-Assyrian Prophetic Texts and Their Relevance to Deutero-Isaiah's Oracle of Salvation," translates "greeting." I am very much indebted to DiVito's insightful analysis of these texts (including K4310, K2401, K883, Cylinder B, V. 46-76, and ABL 923 [K2701a]), which was presented in a 1980 seminar at Harvard University. 40 W.

'i. dn, for which Laroche originally suggested the translation "El des sources, El du jugement." F. M. Cross, E. Lipiniski, and P. C. Craigie all quickly pointed out that "sources" would have to have been written b'rt and that thus we certainly have here another reference to the El Berith of Judg 9:46.45 The occurrence of the word brt ("contract") as a West Semitic loanword into Egyptian during the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Dynasties (ca. 1300-1170) reinforces this interpretation.46 The title 'il brt appears at first to be ambiguous. "El of the covenant" could refer to "El (the divine partner) of the covenant," or it could just as easily refer to "El (the divine witness or guardian) of the covenant." The title that follows, 'il. dn, El the Judge, could easily underscore a more "legal" witness role of El Berith in RS 24.278, and K. A. Kitchen comments that "three of the four deities with whom El-brt and El-dn are associated in our Hurrian Hymn are also securely attested in legal agreements or 'covenants' of a political nature (treaties)" in the role of witnesses.47 On the other hand, Kitchen remarks that RS 24.278 demonstrates "at least ... the reality of the concept of a 'God of covenant' in a religious context." In addition, one could add that there is a large difference between witnessing and judging (El dn) a treaty. Finally, nowhere else, at least to my knowledge, do we have only a single deity witnessing a treaty. The norm is to have multiple deities witnessing treaties. The selection of a single deity behind the epithet El brt is most intriguing (see below). (5) Lastly we turn to the first inscription from Arslan Tash (KAI 27). The Arslan Tash texts have been the subject of a good deal of past discussion48 43 Huffmon, "Prophecy in the Ancient Near East," 700. Nissinen translates similarly: "This treaty tablet of Asur" ("Prophecy and Power Struggle in the Neo-Assyrian Empire"). 44 E. Laroche, in J.

See also the concurring remarks of Kitchen, "Egypt, Ugarit, Qatna and Covenant," 458. M. Dijkstra's alternative analysis of KTU 1.128 ("The Ugaritic-Hurrian Sacrificial Hymn to El," UF 25 [1993] 157-62) reached me after the present manuscript was in press and was thus too late to be incorporated above. Suffice it to say that KTU 1.128 is very difficult to interpret. I would still prefer to see in this hymn exalting the powerful El a reference to his treaty character rather than a reference to the minor deity Il-abrat (Ninshubur), the minister of Anu, often assimilated with Papsukkal. 46 Kitchen, "Egypt, Ugarit, Qatna and Covenant," 453-64. 47 Ibid, 458. 48 The text was published by Du Mesnil du Buisson, "Une tablette magique de la region du 408</page><page sequence="9">Lewis: The Identity and Function of El/Baal Berith 409 including a fairly recent debate over their possible forgery. In 1983 J. Teixidor and P. Amiet challenged the authenticity of the amulets.49 A year later Teixidor (citing Amiet and "some of our colleagues both epigraphists and archaeolo- gists") said that he was quite convinced that "the Arslan Tash tablets are a forgery of the 1930s."50 For almost a decade Teixidor's claim went unchallenged in print and gained some followers. The authenticity of the amulets was the subject of a recent study by J. van Dijk, who concluded, after a detailed refuta- tion of Amiet's iconographic critique, that "the a-lthenticity of the amulets can- not be seriously doubted."51 In addition to his iconographic remarks, van Dijk noted the role of the god Hauron in the text, which could scarcely have been anticipated in the 1930s prior to the discovery of the Ugaritic texts when little was known of the deity.52 "This would seem to make the proposition that the amulets are forgeries very unlikely from the start."53 This is not the proper forum for a detailed epigraphic discussion except to note now the formidable witness of F. M. Cross, who comments as follows: "The Arslan Tash texts contain Phoenician incantations written in two types of Aramaic script. No one alive when they were found or earlier had the compe- tence or materials to produce them. I am certain they are authentic."54 The relevant section for our study has been translated in different ways. The following analysis is that of Z.

For our present purposes it is relevant to note that a covenant is enacted between the person/persons owning the plaque and the god Ashur56 as well as several other deities ("the sons of the gods," "Heaven," Earth") including Baal and Horon. Zevit has underscored the importance of this Arslan Tash inscrip- tion for the history of covenantal studies in ancient Israel: "it is the first clearly attested expression of non-Israelite covenant theology from the ancient Near East."57 If this text is authentic, which seems likely, we have evidence of more than one deity entering into a covenant relationship with the people. Whereas only multiple deities play the role of divine witnesses to treaties, according to this text, either single or multiple deities may enter into covenants ('lt).58 Even though numerous deities are involved in covenants here, it would seem likely that only the deity at the head of the list (Assur) would be preeminent and thus bear the title "the god of the covenant." In sum, we do not have overwhelming evidence in the ancient Near East, apart from ancient Israel, for deities entering into covenant relations with humans. It seems prudent, however, if we remember the solidarity and shared cultural legacy that ancient Israel had with its ancient Near Eastern environ- ment, not to dismiss lightly these data, troublesome as they may be. It seems very likely that the concept of a divine covenant with mortals was known, though not highly developed, elsewhere in the ancient Near East. What about the function of El/Baal Berith? Clements saw another rare example of a deity in the role of a divine partner. The conclusive evidence for Clements included: (a) Ba'al be~rt, meaning "Lord or owner of the covenant," must suggest something "more than the role of a witness or mediator."59 (b) The Shechemites, who would be seen as the vassal party, are referred to as bene hdmor ("sons of the ass"), which seemed to be a covenantal designation to judge from parallel Mari texts.60 We now turn to this relevant material. 56 Cross and Saley argued that we have the pair El and Asherah in this text ("Phoenician Incantations," 44-45; see too Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, 17 n. 29) . But cf. Zevit, "Phoenician Inscription," 115. F. Rosenthal ("The Amulet from Arslan Tash," ANET3, 658) also prefers reading "Ashshur" to Asherah, as does van Dijk ("Authenticy of the Arslan Tash Amulets," 67), who also notes Gaster's iconographic discussion relating to the god Ashur. 57 Zevit, "Phoenician Inscription," 116. 58 On the term 'lt, see Zevit, "Phoenician Inscription," 114-15. 59 Clements, "Baal-Berith of Shechem," 28. 0 Ibid, 29. 410</page><page sequence="11">Lewis: The Identity and Function of El/Baal Berith 411 "The Sons of Hamor" (The Shechemites and Mari Covenant Rituals) In the past, several biblical scholars, prominent among them M. Noth and W. F. Albright, looked to the Mari material to flesh out some of the covenant terminology associated with Shechem.61 In biblical tradition the Shechemites were referred to as the bene hdamr, "sons of Hamor" (Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32; cf. Judg 9:28). Hamor (literally, "donkey, ass") is well known as the father of Shechem. It has been argued that the description of the Shechemites as "sons of a donkey" takes on a new light when viewed over against the Mari texts that describe the slaying of a donkey as a part of a covenant ritual. S. Dalley writes: "a treaty of alliance between two rulers was cemented with a religious cere- mony in which a donkey foal was usually sacrificed, and both parties swore the 'oath of the gods."'62 According to M. Held, the expression in question, Ibayaram/ayaram (mar atdnim) qatdlum/suqtulum (literally, "to kill a donkey foal"), "undoubtedly comes to denote the concluding of a covenant in the Mari dialect."63 There is considerable discussion regarding whether these words are West Semitic loans.64 More important, however, are the inferences one makes from 61 M. Noth, "Old Testament Covenant-making in the light of a Text from Mari," in The Laws in the Pentateuch and Other Studies (London: SCM, 1984 [translated from 1957 German original]) 108-17; Albright, Archaeology and the Religion of Israel, 110; E.

Sokoloff; Winona Lake, IN; Eisenbrauns, 1995) 601 n. 6. 64 Held ("Philological Notes on the Mari Covenant Rituals," 34) argues that "it is clear that neither the substantive (hayarum/ayarum) nor the verb qatdlum/suqtulum are Akkadian (cf. already G. Dossin, "Les archives 6pistolaires du palais de Mari," Syria 19 [1938] 108). Rather, they belong to the West Semitic stratum of the Mari dialect." This reminds us of Tadmor's cautions that "the flow of influence in terminology and formulas" was not exclusively "from Mesopotamia west- ward" ("Treaty and Oath in the Ancient Near East," 127). Tadmor agrees that the sacrificial rite accompanying treaty making is "yet another feature specific to the West Semitic treaty practice, as distinct from those current in Mesopotamia of the Old Babylonian period" (p. 135). Cf. Tadmor, "Assyria and the West: The Ninth Century and Its Aftermath," in Unity and Diversity (ed. H.</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Biblical Literature such conclusions. Even if these terms are loanwords, does this necessarily tell us anything about any underlying realities? Our knowledge of the Mari rituals is far more complete now than when these scholars penned their treatments. In light of D. Charpin's recent examination of the expressions hayaram qatalum and lipit napistim in the textual references, as well as our knowledge of the number of donkeys uncovered from fancy burials mostly in Upper Mesopo- tamia, we should be cautious about reconstructing West Semitic rituals from the Mari evidence and vice versa.65 Thus, it is proper, until we can adequately survey the breadth (both space and time) of the ritual immolation of donkeys both at Mari and in ancient Shechem, to set aside any discussion of specific one-to-one correspondences between ancient Shechemite practices and the Mari donkey immolation rituals.66 Nonetheless, the significance of the expression hayaram qatdlum needs to be unpacked. "In many [Mari] contexts, the phrase seems to have become for- mulaic and cannot be mined for any realities via its component words."67 In other places there are distinct treaty overtones within specific contexts.68 Like- wise, when we consider the Hebrew expression bene h.amor we have to ask whether this designation is generic (cf. the reference in Gen 49:14f. to Issachar as a "bony ass") or whether bene hdmor does indeed retain nuances of treaty making. From the extant data one cannot decide. There may indeed be treaty nuances behind bene h.anmr. Nothing I have said rules this out. We just don't have the empirical data to say this with any certainty. Similarly, we are at a loss when it comes to material remains. From the excavation reports from Tell Balatah, we know that donkey immolation of some sort was also known at Shechem. L. E. Toombs has recently written the follow- ing while commenting on LB IB (Stratum XIV): Goedicke and J. J. M. Roberts; Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1975) 43. But cf. Par- pola, "Neo-Assyrian Treaties from the Royal Archives," 180-83. 65 Cf. D. Charpin, "Une alliance contre l'Elam et le rituel du lipit napistim," in F.

I am indebted to Jack Sasson for these references. 66 As this paper was being submitted, I received an e-mail note from E. D. Oren that an extensive cult site of the MB-Hyksos period (seventeenth century BCE) was uncovered at Tel Haror in the western Negev. In Oren's words, "the site comprised a typical Syrian 'Migdal' temple, a courtyard with favissae that included ceremonially killed (by twisting their neck) puppy dogs as well as a ceremonial burial with donkeys." 67 J. Sasson (personal communication). 68 See Charpin (n. 65 above). E. Firmage (ABD 6.1137) notes that "in S. Arabia, too, the don- key seems to have played a role in the ritual of treaty making, as seen in the following passage: kl gwm d'lm wsymm wdhblm whmrm, 'every community (owing allegiance to) a god or patron deity or (bound by) an alliance or hmr [ass]-treaty' (RES 3945.1; cf. 3624; 3948.4ff.)." 412</page><page sequence="13">Lewis: The Identity and Function of El/Baal Berith Under the lowest floor of the outer guardroom the body of a quadruped, probably a donkey, had been buried. The head was missing. It had been sev- ered from the body prior to the burial. Near the neck was a clump of bones from a smaller animal. The deposit appears to be a foundation sacrifice. It is particularly interesting since Gen 33:19 refers to the Shechemites as bene hdmor, "sons of a donkey."69 The rationale underlying the slaying of this donkey is not clear. If we do have a foundation sacrifice, the context would be quite different than the hayaram qatdlum ritual that accompanied an alliance made between two Mari rulers. Perhaps such a sacrifice was done out of some notion of a covenant with a patron deity. But this is only speculation. In conclusion, the biblical reference to the Shechemites as bene hdmor ("sons of an ass" = "members of the covenant"?) and the physical remains of a donkey (?) immolation ceremony at Tell Balatah are indeed enticing, yet incon- clusive. They may underscore a long-standing association of Shechemite reli- gion and covenant terminology. Genesis 14:13: New Evidencefor the Debate There is a fragment of extremely relevant evidence that has never, at least to my knowledge, been brought into the debate. The Hebrew expression ba'al benrt occurs only in Judg 8:33; 9:4, yet scholars have failed to note that the plu- ral expression bacdle benrt occurs in Gen 14:13. In this well-known episode Abram is described as living "by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eschol and of Aner; these were ba'ale berit of Abram." Scholars have unani- mously translated this expression "allies" (NRSV, RSV, NJPS, REB, etc.) or the like. Indeed, Aner, Eschol, and Mamre take a share in the booty that was obtained through Abram's defeat of the alliance of the four eastern kings. Thus, the expression ba'dle berit clearly designates treaty partners. To judge from its usage here, Hebrew ba'al berit ("one who owns or is a lord of a berit") may very well be an idiom, or perhaps even a technical term, designating one who enters into a covenant relationship.70 If applied to the deity known as Baal Berith we would seem to have evidence that such deity played the role of partner in the treaty as opposed to the more common ancient Near Eastern role of witness or guardian of the treaty. Cognate expressions are difficult to assess due to (a) the numerous terms 69 L. E. Toombs, "Shechem," ABD 5.1182. 70 What is the relevance of the repeated reference in Judges 9 to the "bacdle^ skem" (9:2, 3, 20, 46, 51)? Most scholars see some description of aristocracy behind the term (see, e.g., R. de Vaux, The Early History of Israel [Philadelphia: Westminster, 1978] 802). RSV and others lose any potential (covenant?) nuance with their translation "the citizens/men of Shechem." See our conclu- sion below. 413</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Biblical Literature involving treaties and agreements, (b) the lack of exact one-to-one correspon- dence with Hebrew terminology, and (c) differences in literary Gattungen and Sitze im Leben.71 Some Akkadian expressions, such as bel ade, bel sulummd'e, and bel salami, would support the use of ba'al/bel + agreement/oath term to designate treaty partners (= allies). Bel ada, which occurs in the Neo-Assyrian, Standard Babylonian, and Neo-Babylonian literature, means quite literally "lord of the covenant/oath." Similar to the biblical ba'dle bert in Gen 14:13, it denotes treaty partners or, in other words, those who are bound by an ade agreement (CAD Al, 134).72 Thus, in ABL 555 line 7 we read of an unknown person who describes himself as "a bel ade (party bound by an ade oath) of the king."73 In Sennacherib's annals we read of the king Padi, the king of Ekron, who is described as a vassal party bound to Assyria by an adu agreement as well as a mdmitu oath (bel ade u midmt sa mdt Asurki).74 According to CT 54 580, when the king of Elam and the king of Assyria became allies, they "made peace with one another (isselmt) and became treaty partners (bel ade ahdmis)."75 Bel sulummd'e (literally, "lord of a peace treaty/agreement") is used in a similar fashion to designate an ally (CAD S, 373 [KUB 3 73:11 letter of Tn I). Finally, compare the Babylonian allies of Assurbanipal, who claim that "the enemy of Assurbanipal will not be our ally" (la LU. EN saldmini).76 The cognate evidence is very suggestive for our discussion, yet a closer look cautions us from being too hasty in drawing our conclusions. All of the expressions cited above of ba'al/bel + treaty term (Gen 14:13 included) involve human agreements and sometimes refer to divine witnesses elsewhere in the text. The only clear expression of bel + treaty term with deities is an Akkadian expression bel mrdmiti ("lord of the oath") and its usage refers to deities in the traditional role of witnessing, guarding, and supervising the oath. This expres- sion seems to be quite well attested and widespread (cf. CAD M1, 192). P. Machinist notes that "belu md'miti is a common expression in New Kingdom Hittite treaties for the deities supervising the treaty (AHw 599b, 2d)."77 71 On the various ancient Near Eastern terms for treaty, see Tadmor, "Treaty and Oath in the Ancient Near East," 127-52, as well as the older works V.

The role of the divine witness/guardian in treaties is usually occupied by numer- ous deities. There is no reference, as far as I know, to only a single deity as a wit- ness or guardian in treaty formularies.78 If this is true, an epithet describing a single deity connected with the treaty ("El/Baal of the covenant") must signify something other than the role of a witness/guardian. The selection of one deity most likely reflects a patron deity of a town who was accorded a special status perhaps due to the feeling of a special kinship79 bond (cf. Hebrew berit; Akk. birTtu) between (cf. Hebrew benrt; Akk. birit)80 the patron deity and the popu- lace (=El/Baal Berith). When all the above evidence is evaluated, some of it stronger than others, it is fair to conclude that the weight of the cumulative data is in favor of seeing the concept of divine treaty partner at pre-Israelite Shechem. IV. The Preeminence of El Berith Can two deities play the role of the patron deity or covenant partner in one locality? Probably not. If we are only dealing with one deity behind the epithets El Berith and Baal Berith, to which deity is reference being made? To put it another way: Do we have "El, the lord (bacal) of the covenant" or "Baal, the god ('el) of the covenant?" A priori we cannot decide which of these two deities would better head the clan groups (both El and Baal Hamon head confedera- cies elsewhere)81 at Shechem exceptfor Israelite tradition, which prefers El (cf. 78 I owe this insight to F. M. Cross. 79 F. M. Cross, in a forthcoming work entitled "Kinship and Covenant in Ancient Israel," has underscored the function of the patron deity within the sociological framework of tribal relation- ships. Cross concludes that the role of divine covenant partner is an extension of the role of a deity as divine kinsman. This is especially true of the West Semitic tribal organizations, asserts Cross, in which the clan (or league for that matter) was seen as kin of the deity. This is "especially vivid in the West Semitic onomasticon" which reflect a great number of divine kinsman names (see Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, 6). Cross would further conclude that such tribal organizations are typo- logically patriarchal with the proper divine kinsman being an El figure. I would like to thank Prof. Cross for sharing this work with me prior to publication. 80 By using these terms I am, of course, drawing attention to the ongoing debate over the ety- mology, meaning, and usage of Hebrew berit. See W. F. Albright, "The Hebrew Expression for 'Making a Covenant' in Pre-Israelite Documents," BASOR 121 (1951) 22 n. 6; 0. Loretz, "fnl-- Bond-Bund," VT 16 (1966) 239-41; G. R. Driver, review of A.

Weinfeld, "Berit-Covenant vs. Obligation," Bib 56 (1975) 122-23; Tadmor, "Treaty and Oath in the Ancient Near East," 137-38. 81 There is always the possibility of seeing these two deities as one and the same (cf. Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, 24ff.). 415</page><page sequence="16">Journal of Biblical Literature the Shechemite deity mentioned in Gen 33:30 called 'el 'elohe yis'rd'l, which certainly seems to mean "El, the god of [the patriarch] Israel").82 The extrabiblical evidence would also tip the scales in favor of El. The Hurrian text (RS 24.278; KTU 1.128.14-15) from Ugarit mentioned above, which specifically mentions as an epithet of El the title 'il brt, has been over- looked for solving the question of El Berith versus Baal Berith. The attestation of the very same title El Berith in RS 24.278 would argue against Clements's view that "the title El-Berith was simply an alternative for Baal-Berith, with El used in a purely appellative sense."83 The context of RS 24.278, a hymn to El, as well as the additional epithet "El, the judge" (cf. the Ugr. PN dnil) underscores a prominent role for the Canaanite god El, most likely an authoritative role as head of the pantheon, which is well attested elsewhere. If we take a hint from this Hurrian text from Ugarit, then El Berith in Judg 9:46 is not a title of an alleged deity Baal Berith (Judg 8:33; 9:4). The title El Berith, the "god of the covenant," is an epithet of Canaanite El, who has his own temple in Judg 9:46. The phrase ba'al berit, rather than denoting a separate deity, seems to be a title referring to El's role as "lord of the covenant." V. Iconographic Contributions to the Debate This is not the place to interact with the numerous studies on Syro- Palestinian bronze statuary.84 Many of these figurines are related to the present study, but only two will be singled out for attention because of the connection (or alleged connection) to Shechemite religion.

It wears a conical headdress usually described as analogous to the white crown of Upper Egypt. It stands 18.4 cm high in a striding position with bent arms that originally grasped either a weapon, a staff, or a standard. E. F. Campbell described the hands as follows: "Both fists are clenched around a core of silver-colored metal; conceivably the right hand held a spear or staff in vertical position while the left hand held a dagger."86 0. Negbi suggested that the right arm was once in the upraised position, typical of warrior figurines, but has since dropped down as a result of the pegged armpit construction.87 But Campbell tested such a hypothesis from the start and concluded that it was simply impossible: "the peg is of a slightly off-square shape and will not permit setting the arm 180 degrees differently. Even if the arm were forced into that position, it would be in a grotesque backward bend .... the fist would be away up behind the head and by no means in the smiting position... .The only posi- tion the arm can take is the benign one on the photograph."88 The Harvard Semitic Bronze Figurine (Figures 2, 3) In 1957 D. P. Hansen published a bronze figurine, acquired in Jerusalem from N. Ohan in 1906 by D. G. Lyon, which was said to have come from Nablus.89 The lack of archaeological context should be underscored and any conclusions, even cautiously drawn, must be held in check.90 Notwithstanding these cautions, Hansen is surely correct that "there is no reason to doubt the suggested Palestinian provenance of the Semitic Museum bronze."91 86 Campbell, "Field VII," 24. 87 Negbi, Canaanite Gods in Metal, 165. 88 Campbell, personal letter to the author dated 18 June 1994. 89 D. P. Hansen, "A Bronze in the Semitic Museum of Harvard University," BASOR 146 (1957) 13-19. From the records of purchase, it would seem that Mr. Ohan kept quite detailed accounts of the proveniences. Acquisitions from antiquities dealers are notoriously suspicious, especially those said to come from well-publicized excavations. In this case the identification might be a little more believable because the first excavations at Tell Balatah, under the direction of E. Sellin, did not begin until 1913. Few other scholars have studied this bronze. Cf. Negbi, Canaanite Gods in Metal, 48, 171 [#1449; fig. 57]. I would like to thank the staff of the Semitic Museum for providing me access to study the figurine in the summer of 1992. 90 Compare Negbi's uncritical reference to this figure as "the Shechem figurine" and "the fig- urine from Shechem" (Canaanite Gods in Metal, 48).

III (cf. #1451 from Megiddo) [although I have challenged the Iron I dating of these in "Divine Images and Aniconism in Ancient Israel" (forthcoming inJAOS)] and two strays housed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which, according to Muscarella, "should be dated to the late Bronze Age, about fourteenth-thirteenth century B.C., or slightly later" (see O. W. Muscarella, Bronze and Iron, #490, #491; = Negbi #1647, #1440). 92 Hansen, "A Bronze in the Semitic Museum of Harvard University," 15-16. 93 There is no clear example of male bronze statuary from a clearly identifiable Iron Age Israelite site. See my "Divine Images and Aniconism in Ancient Israel" (forthcoming inJAOS). 419</page><page sequence="20">Journal of Biblical Literature Iconography Both of the figurines seem to be deities, rather than humans. Although, as P. R. S. Moorey and S. Fleming point out, without accompanying inscriptional evidence there is no way of knowing for certain.94 Any number of deities may be nominated for the identity of the two bronze figurines above, so one cannot be too dogmatic. If we assume that we are dealing with Canaanite deities (for- eign imports are always a possibility), first glance would lead us to conjecture that the Tell BalAtah bronze represents Baal imagery and the Harvard Semitic bronze depicts El imagery. A second glance urges caution. The Tell Baldtah Bronze The bronze is represented in a striding position, and this seems, as sug- gested by Negbi's typological groupings, to be a characteristic of the warrior gods.95 If Negbi's speculation that this bronze once yielded a weapon in a strik- ing pose (see above) were correct, all students of Canaanite lore would give the nod to Baal/Hadad, the warrior par excellence.96 Of course, Reshep could also be nominated, as could El if some scholars are correct that he too may have once had a warrior nature at least to some degree.97 But, as we have argued above, following the remarks of E. F. Campbell, the Tell Balatah bronze is in a more benign position. Thus, we should guard against hastily lumping it together with the ubiquitous category of the bronzes in smiting position. In addition, we are unable to determine what was once in the grasp of the bronze's hands. Weapons are likely, yet the hands could just as easily have grasped staffs or standards. Regardless, we should not rush to identifying the bronze as a Baal figurine. From the Ugaritic texts we know that both El and Baal are known to wield some type of spear or staff-like weapon ('arz, h.t; cf. KTU 1.4.7.40-41; 1.23.37-40, 43-44, 47),98 and thus theoretically either could be a candidate for 94 Moorey and Fleming, "Problems in the Study of the Anthropomorphic Metal Statuary," 79. 5 T. N. D. Mettinger also notes that the striding/walking posture is more characteristic of Baal (In Search of God: The Meaning and Message of the Everlasting Names [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1988] 79-80). Compare also A. Caquot and M. Sznycer's iconographic discussion (Ugaritic Religion [Leiden: Brill, 1980] 12, plates VIII and IX). See too Moorey and Fleming's cri- tique ("Problems in the Study of the Anthropomorphic Metal Statuary," 79) of Caquot and Sznycer's identification of the bronze figures with Baal. 96 Baal is described in the Ugaritic texts as wielding weapons to strike Yamm. Compare his magic double-headed axe in KTU 1.2.4.13f., 20f. and the use of the slaughtering axe in his right hand [yd//ymn] in KTU 1.2.1.39-40 (cf. 1.3.5.22; 1.4.2.4). It is little wonder that almost all scholars have identified the limestone relief of the striking deity excavated at Ugarit with Baal. See Met- tinger, In Search of God, 79. 97 P. D. Miller, "El The Warrior," HTR 60 (1967) 411-31; F. M. Cross, "'l," TDOT 1.251; A. Vaughn, "il gzr-An Explicit Epithet of El as a Hero/Warrior," UF 25 (1993) 423-30. 98 Cf. Caquot and Sznycer, Ugaritic Religion, plate X. 420</page><page sequence="21">Lewis: The Identity and Function of El/Baal Berith the Tell Balatah bronze. In short, the Tell Balatah bronze is a good illustration of how little we can say positively about the identity of bronze statuary. The Harvard Semitic Museum Bronze Typologically the Harvard Semitic Bronze belongs to Negbi's category Type V (= enthroned male deities) which "do not carry weapons, but hold scepters, standards, cups, bowls and goblets.... [They] are usually depicted with their right hand raised in a gesture of benediction.""9 When one thinks of the Canaanite deity who best fits an enthroned figure with drink in hand El comes to mind. To be sure, most gods have thrones and are cheered by wine. But it is El whom most scholars have associated with the enthroned deity depicted on the famous serpentine stela excavated at Ugarit (it too, like the Harvard Semitic Museum bronze, is egyptianized and holds out in his right hand a cup for drink'0?) and for good reason.101 Drinking, even in vast quantities, is attested among the deities. Baal's ser- vant puts a cup into his hands, a large goblet into both of his hands (KTU 1.3.1.10-11). But El's love of drinking seems to surpass all other deities. Most instructive is KTU 1.114.2-4, which describes El's marzeah, a well-documented drinking feast.102 We hear El inviting the gods to drink heartily: El called the gods to the carving: Eat, gods, and drink, Drink wine unto satiety, Must unto drunkenness. El himself follows his own instructions and drinks to the point of complete ine- briation (KTU 1.114.16-21). 99 Negbi, Canaanite Gods in Metal, 46. 100 For other examples of Late Bronze statuary seated and holding cups or bowls in their right hands, see Moorey and Fleming, "Problems in the Study of the Anthropomorphic Metal Statuary," 85 and plate xxiv #19, #20; plate xxv #21. 101 Cf. N. Wyatt, "The Stela of the Seated God from Ugarit," UF 15 (1983) 271-77; Caquot and Sznycer, Ugaritic Religion, plate VII. One might pause at the lack of a beard on the Harvard Semitic Museum bronze. Compare a similar seated figurine from Ugarit with a beard (Caquot and Szyncer, plate Villa; Syria XLIII 1966, plate II), which has been thought to be the god El (so Caquot and Szyncer, 23, caption on plate VIIIa; cf. Negbi, Canaanite Gods in Metal, #1442). Yet a very similar bronze from Byblos (see Negbi 48, #1443 ) is beardless. The nakedness of the Harvard Semitic Museum figure should not present difficulties to those familiar with the sexual escapades of El in KTU 1.23. 102 See T. J. Lewis, Cults of the Dead in Ancient Israel and Ugarit (HSM 39; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1989) 80-94. 421</page><page sequence="22">Journal of Biblical Literature Iconographic Conclusions We have no way of knowing for sure the degree to which El-type deities and Baal-type deities were distinguished conceptually and iconographically in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages in the Canaanite religions. Nonetheless, even though the study of bronze statuary is a complicated one, it is not a hap- hazard one. While we may not be able to securely identify deities by name, we can distinguish typologically at least two distinct categories, the enthroned male deities (= Negbi Type V) and the even better attested male deity in the smiting position (usually striding) (= Negbi's Type III warrior deities).103 Of our two bronzes one is easier to identify, the other easier to locate at Shechem. The Harvard Semitic Museum bronze's representation of an en- throned deity with drink in hand could attest to some type of El (El Berith?) worship. The likelihood that this bronze represents a Baal figure is remote. Yet equating this bronze with Shechemite religion is precarious because of the lack of secure archaeological context. In contrast, the secure archaeological context of the Tell Balatah bronze makes it easy to equate with Shechemite religion, yet it is more puzzling to identify. If Negbi were right that it was a smiting god, it could represent a warrior deity, perhaps Baal (Baal Berith?), at Shechem in the Late Bronze Age, although we shouldn't be too hasty to dismiss the warrior aspect of El altogether, in all locations and in every period. The benign por- trayal (especially if staffs or standards were present rather than weapons) tones down but does not eliminate the warrior aspects of this figure. In short, this bronze could easily represent a Baal figure. Yet the data do not rule out the identification of an El figure. VI. Conclusion Vtv tn ':Tn i:p. So what can we conclude about the religion of pre- Israelite Shechem and our god in question from these complex data? This article has sought to go beyond those who attempt to interpret Baal and El Berith using solely the biblical data. But even here our literary analysis runs into roadblocks of later tradition. Is Yerubbaal the same as Gideon? How are we to understand the Deuteronomist's folk etymology of Yerubbaal's name in Judg 6:31-32 ("May Baal contend against him") in light of Northwest Semitic onomasticon, which would suggest the exact opposite? What is the relation of El/Baal Berith to Yahweh? Such questions are equally daunting and will have to be the subject of another study. It is safe to say that the god Baal was present in pre-Israelite Shechem. Though the Tell Balatah bronze may be somewhat ambiguous, a Baal figure of some sort can be surmised from the three occurrences of the name Hadad as a 103 Cf. J. D. Muhly, "Bronze Figurines and Near Eastern Metalwork," IEJ 30 (1980) 155. 422</page><page sequence="23">Lewis: The Identity and Function of El/Baal Berith theophoric element in personal names on a cuneiform fragment found at Shechem.104 Baal's presence would hardly be surprising given what we know of Canaanite pantheons. It would be rare indeed if Amorite/Canaanite Shechem did not have a robust pantheon (cf. the multiple sacred structures in the pre- liminary archaeological publications).l05 Nevertheless, this does not mean that this Baal deity bore the epithet ba'al beit. While it is certainly possible to have numerous deities establish covenants with the same people (cf. the Arslan Tash discussion above), it would be more likely that only one deity at a time would be seen as the patron deity. It would be difficult to imagine the populace of a city worshiping simultaneously two patron deities, each of which was viewed as a treaty partner with the city. As concluded above, (a) preference must be given to the deity El Berith, and (b) 'el berit is not an appellative of a god Baal Berith (so Clements). In short, it is more likely that ba'al berit served as an epithet of the god El Berith, who was referred to as "the lord of the covenant," a patron god who established a kinship bond with the city inhabitants (who perhaps were in turn called ba'cle gskem). This covenant language is best understood over against the flowering of international diplomacy in the fifteenth-thirteenth centuries as documented by treaties from Amarna, Ras Shamra, Boghazkoy, and Alalakh, which are rich in kinship terminology.106 And perhaps the Shechemite deity El Berith is repre- sented before us in one or both of these bronzes. F. M. Cross argues for seeing a "basic syncretistic impulse in Near Eastern polytheism which tends to merge gods with similar traits and functions."'07 Eventually the Canaanite religion at Shechem gave way to the monolatrous and exclusivist tendencies in early Israelite religion. The same exclusive vision that transformed a Canaanite polytheism into a monolatrous worship of the god El was responsible for developing the notion of the deity as a treaty partner to a far greater degree than that found among Israel's neighbors. At some point in time exclusive Yahwism also developed an aniconic tradition that resisted portraying the male deity in graphic form similar to the bronze figurines in this study. As intriguing as these topics are for reconstructing early Israelite religion, they must await another time and place.'08 104 See n. 11 above. 105 Cf. L. E. Toombs, "Shechem," ABD 5.1182 and Judg 9:46. 106 By saying this we are not discrediting the rich heritage of earlier covenant formularies such as those coming from Hatti and Mari. 107 Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, 49. 108 My preliminary remarks can be found in "Divine Images and Aniconism in Ancient Israel" (forthcoming inJAOS). 423</page></plain_text>
