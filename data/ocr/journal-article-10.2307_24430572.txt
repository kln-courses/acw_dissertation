<plain_text><page sequence="1">Photography Mary Ellen Mark's Long-Term Relationships By Ellen Felchnan Three acrobats, Vazquez Brothers Circus, Mexico City, Mexico, 1997 Mary Ellen Mark is one of the most acclaimed photographers of our time, often working in the documentary realm that favors long-term relationships between photographer and subject. The images here are from her most recent book, Man and Beast: Photographs from Mexico and India (2014), which includes 116 images taken over forty years, many published for the first time. Since we can print only a few photographs— and we wanted to show a unified selection—we encourage you to seek out the book to see the full richness of (mostly) circus life captured by Mark. Here is an excerpt from "MEM and Beast," the introductory essay by Melissa Harris, editor in chief of Aperture Foundation, for Man and Beast: [Mark] becomes deeply invested in many of her subjects—sometimes knowing and photographing them over the course of many years, as she did with Erin Charles (a.k.a. Tiny, of [Mark's] 1980s project Streetwise), and with the Damms, a homeless family that Mary Ellen photographed many times. There is often a performative or interactive element to the photographs, whether they are of twins, prom-goers, or street children; whether she is on the streets of Oaxaca, Mexico, where she teaches workshops each year, or at a horse farm in Connecticut or a circus in Calcutta, or photographing dogs—pretty much everywhere. Mary Ellen's sense of dogs' unconditional love is matched only by her belief that beasts are, unlike man, rarely if ever gratuitously cruel. This understanding infuses Mary Ellen's images with an unsentimental poignancy and a fully intentional anthropomorphism that, while sometimes ironic and other times unsettling, always render photographs that are remarkably engaging. © Two girls and a dwarf, Raj Kamal Circus, Upleta, India, 1989 Ellen Feldman, WRB's photography editor, is a photographer and writer with a PhD in cinema studies from New York University.
