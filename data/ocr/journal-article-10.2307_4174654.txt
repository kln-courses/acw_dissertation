<plain_text><page sequence="1">Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World: Natural Art and the Body Politic by Oddvar Holmesland M - f ARGARET Cavendish was born into a transitional age when old assumptions were challenged and new certainties had not been found. In her nonfiction, she repeatedly confesses to women's inherent limitations, apparently accepting a patriarchal Toryism as sanctioned by nature.1 However, she also reveals an anti- traditionalist aspiration: to emulate men, as a philosopher and writer; to have a society in which women may achieve success and power. Hence, in her fictional works she creates escapist romance visions of heroic female scholars and rulers. Her ideological position appears contradictory, as is suggested in The Blazing World by her ambiguous use of allegorico-romance form. On the one hand, this is a tale of virtue rewarded within the parameters of a providential aristocratic ideol- ogy.2 On the other hand, the narrative may also be read as a feminine I Marilyn L. Williamson argues that in the 166os, Cavendish abandoned her view that women's inferior status was socially based, and came to see female submissiveness and male superiority as established by nature. This, then, may account for some of the contra- dictoriness of her writing: "Her thinking was constrained by allegiance to nature and to ideals she herself had outgrown" (Raising Their Voices: British Women Writers, 1650-1750 [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 19901, 48, 63). 2 The Blazing World starts with a beautiful young lady being abducted by a lovesick merchant who is beneath her "both in birth and wealth" (125). Heaven avenges this atrocity by having the miscreant and his crew seized by a tempest and carried towards the North Pole, where they freeze to death. The gods guide the virtuous lady safely to strange shores, where she transverses the poles to the Blazing World. She becomes ac- quainted with its anthropomorphic inhabitants, and they accompany her to "Paradise," where she marries the Emperor. He gives her absolute sovereignty over his realm, and he and her subjects worship her as if she were a divinity. Against an England "embroiled in a great war" (referring to the Dutch Wars) as well as suffering internal strife in the wake of civil war, the Blazing World becomes a place for utopian restoration (203).

Cavendish's motive may have been to create a new order in which women's true potential is valued.3 Inter- pretation is further complicated, however, by the fact that critics have doubted her feminist solidarity and stressed instead her craving for personal fame and singularity.4 Such an approach makes her appear as a seeker of personal power and glory as ends in themselves. This essay on The Blazing World takes a more sympathetic view. To Cavendish, greatness involves having the power of self-liberation and self-management; yet her pursuit of singularity is not confined to the self, but extends to a free, self-ordering course in nature. Her quest, moreover, can be seen to have an artistic as well as epistemological di- mension. Singularity thus includes having the command of a free artis- tic space, as expressed in Cavendish's wish "not only to be Empress, but Authoress of a whole world." The latter is to be taken in a "poetical" sense (224). In her artistic vision, she explores a more natural Restora- tion world, expanded and complemented through the individual cre- ative imagination. Her idea of an organic balance is what combines the here the Empress's soul descends to bestow her regime on England and its dominions. Page references here and below are to Margaret Cavendish, The Blazing World and Other Writings, ed. Kate Lilley, rev. ed. (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1994), and are subsequently included in the text. 3 Lisa T Sarasohn argues that Cavendish "fervently defended the superiority of mon- archy and hierarchy, reflecting class rather than gender solidarity, but realized all forms of political association were a tyranny of men over women" ("A Science Turned Up- side Down: Feminism and the Natural Philosophy of Margaret Cavendish," Huntington Library Quarterly 47 [19841: 293). In the introduction to her edition, Kate Lilley contends that The Blazing World combines "a narrative of the liberty of the female soul and the emancipatory possibilities of utopian speculation and writing specifically for women" with "a narrative of the effortless rise of a woman to absolute power" and the vindication of an ideology based on "rank, property and propriety" (xxv). Susan Wiseman stresses another but related aspect: "What is at stake throughout Cavendish's writing is the in- transigent interrelationship between patriarchal or monarchist ideals and the desire to disrupt gender ideology.... To suggest reform in gender hierarchy was to point, in- evitably, towards the current instability of class hierarchy. Cavendish, writing at a time when this instability was barely beginning to lessen, mounted only limited challenges to gender hierarchy" ("Gender and Status in Dramatic Discourse: Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle," in Women, Writing, History, 1640-1740, ed. Isobel Grundy and Susan Wiseman [Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 19921, 177). 4 Janet Todd, for instance, suggests that "the Duchess's immense egoism puffs out any incipient feminist feeling"; she "remarks that, although there may be famous women in history whom she does not know about, she does not wish to be illuminated since they might overshadow her own 'glory' and prevent her, after all, from being 'Margaret the First"' (The Sign of Angellica: Women, Writing, and Fiction, z66o-18oo [New York: Colum- bia University Press, 1989], 65).</page><page sequence="3">Oddvar Holmesland 459 singularity of the author and the sovereignty of the Empress in The Blaz- ing World with a more communal form of feminism. The liberating light or reason is her inspiration, an attitude that she shares with the new phi- losophers of the seventeenth century. Still, Cavendish's position does carry contradictions, for though she was a maverick writer in her time, her raw materials were largely traditional discourses encountering a new world. Her idea of natural relations can consequently be seen to subscribe to the notion of an aristocratic order instituted by God. Being both empress and 'Authoress of a whole world" similarly takes on a sanctified sense, drawing on patterns of spiritual allegory. For a writer committed to a natural course, these contradictions reflect her unstable conception of nature, a mark of the categorical instability of her age. The Blazing World dialectically negotiates between an aristocratically conceived natural order and the desire for emulation and singularity. Critics have noted a dialectic, but not on the premise of nature. Cather- ine Gallagher, for instance, posits a point at which Cavendish's "Tory- ism and feminism converge" in terms of a transition from the "ideology of absolute monarchy" to that of the "absolute self."5 The Cavendishes' exile during the Civil War would induce this metaphoric equivalence. Banished and deprived of their high standing in the real kingdom, Mar- garet is seen to fall back on an imaginary state governed by her sov- ereign self. Like Charles II in real life, she rules without a country, but exploits this freedom to dissolve traditional categories and reassemble them into a private utopia. Kate Lilley, on similar terms, notes how 5 Catherine Gallagher, "Embracing the Absolute: The Politics of the Female Subject in Seventeenth-Century England," Genders z (1988): 25. Similarly, Kate Lilley regards The Blazing World as the medium through which Cavendish can vindicate "the extreme practice of living singularly" ("Blazing Worlds: Seventeenth-Century Women's Utopian Writing," in Women, Texts, and Histories, 1575-1760, ed. Clare Brant and Diane Purkiss [London and New York: Routledge, 1992], 123). James Fitzmaurice, however, balances this image of Cavendish's exclusiveness: she presents herself, on the one hand, "as a soli- tary genius who depended on the power of fancy to conjure up original compositions," and on the other, "as a happy wife, well integrated into a harmonious family" ("Fancy and the Family: Self-characterizations of Margaret Cavendish," Huntington Library Quar- terly 53 [1ggol: 199). Finally, Cavendish herself maintains that "I am not so Retir'd, as to bar my self from the Company of my good Friends, or such as are free from Exception, as not to Translate harmless and simple Words, to an evil Sense or Meaning, or such as are so Noble, as not to Dispraise, or Detract from such Persons as they are pleas'd to take the pains to Visit, or from such as will not take it for a Neglect, if I do not punctually return their Visit, or perhaps not Visit them at any time, but will Excuse or Pardon my Lazy Humour, and not account it a Disrespect, as truly it is none, for I do Honour and Admire all Civil, Worthy, and Honourable Persons, and would be ready at all times Hon- estly to Serve them" (Sociable Letters [London, 1664; reprint, Menston, England: Scolar Press, 1969], 61.</page><page sequence="4">460 Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World Cavendish is in "pursuit of hybridization" by means of "promiscu- ously mixing what she calls romancical, philosophical and fantastical elements." To Lilley, this mixing works as a "model of surpassing." Cavendish, in making her utopia, thus "authorizes [her] textual and personal singularity as authentically poetic and a new nature."6 The term "hybridization" aptly captures Cavendish's method of blending established genres and categories into a new order, and of presenting her fantasy empire as verisimilar.7 Yet it would be reduc- tive to term her perspective solipsistic. Her naturalizing method has a further aim: to create a sense of singularity in the context of a natu- ral balance. The notion of self thus becomes relative through reference to the motion of nature thought to permeate all individuals, like all matter. Cavendish's idea of nature, as presented in Observations upon Experimental Philosophy, has the form of "one Body ... ordering her self-moving parts with all facility and ease, without any disturbance, living in pleasure and delight, with infinite Varieties and Curiosities, such as no single Part or Creature of hers can ever attain to" (italics mine).8 Her point of departure seems to be that nature, not the self, is autonomous, with the capacity to order itself harmoniously. There is a level at which the utopian Blazing World reflects Cavendish's ambi- tion as more than the desire to surpass others. Rather, she artistically exercises her command to order her life, and the world, as she thinks natural. Correspondingly, her idea of singularity seems closely linked to attaining the privilege of a natural artistic freedom. What she seeks seems to be expressed in the following passage re- ferring to her exile during the Civil War. It is remarkably similar to the previously quoted passage that rendered her idea about self-ordering nature: I by this Retirement live in a calm Silence, wherein I have my Contemplations free from Disturbance, and my Mind lives in Peace, and my Thoughts in Plea- sure . .. my Mind is entertain'd . . . and takes as much Delight as Augustus Caesar did to have his Mecaenas, the Patron of Poets, sit and hear Virgil and Horace read their Works unto them; so my Mind takes Delight in its dear Mecae- nas, which is Contemplation, and to have its Poetical Thoughts ... Repeat their Poems, and other Works which they make; and those my Mind likes best, it 6 Lilley, ed., The Blazing World and Other Writings, xxiv. 7 Paul Salzman, commenting on The Blazing World, notes "the swift establishment of verisimilitude at the beginning of the tale, so essential for stories of this kind" (English Prose Fiction, 1558-1700: A Critical History [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 19851, 295). 8 Cavendish, Observations upon Experimental Philosophy, 2d ed. (London, 1668), 4.</page><page sequence="5">Oddvar Holmesland 461 sends them forth to the Senses to write them down, and then to send them out to the publick view of the World... so that the Mind and the Thoughts imploy the Senses, and the Senses imploy the Mind and Thoughts, and thus I take ... Pleasure within my self.9 The passage portrays a woman who enjoys the withdrawn preroga- tives of an emperor. It has indeed been read as the statement of an "utterly private self," expressing the "metaphorical equivalence of sov- ereign monarch and sovereign private person," "the private woman ... imagined as a self-sufficient court, complete with monarch, patron, poets, ministers, and heralds."'1 However, this view of a dialectic be- tween "absolute self" and "absolute monarchy" becomes in itself too absolute. What Cavendish seems to treasure above all is the privilege of a private artistic space. Inspired by the freedom of her "Poetical Thoughts," she creates an image of self in tune with natural motion. If, in her fiction, she is tempted towards a "model of surpassing," being absolute empress of a microcosm as compensation for her exclusion from the polity, then the desire to be in accord with natural patterns seems to serve as her corrective model. Much of her social critique con- cerns a world that has a contortive impact on natural self-command and tranquillity-qualities that she courts in her utopian writing. Cher- ishing ease and balance, she "would not change it for all the Pleasures of the Publick World, nay, not to be Mistress of the World, for I should not desire to be Mistress of that which is too Big to be Commanded, too Self-willed to be Ruled, too Factious to be Governed, too Turbulent to live in Peace."11 Her exile, though forced, opens up an alternative world to her, which, according to Graham Parry, would be shared by kindred spirits: "The retreat into private life that follows, where friend- ship, poetry, and wine provide the Horatian consolations for the loss of ascendancy, was the lot of many royalist gentlemen after the Civil Wars: the literary ideal of retirement took on a new significance . ., and poetry ... helped to mitigate the experience of defeat."'12 It is easy to see the potential conflict with her ambitious struggle to emulate scien- tists and scholars and win public fame in her own day. Her struggle, in a society full of obstacles, was for women's natural right of creative 9 Cavendish, Sociable Letters, 56-58. 10 Gallagher, "Embracing the Absolute," 29. 11 Cavendish, Sociable Letters, 61-62. 12 Graham Parry, The Seventeenth Century: The Intellectual and Cultural Context of English Literature, 1603-1700 (London and New York: Longman, 1989), 85.</page><page sequence="6">462 Margaret Cavendish 's The Blazing World freedom. In engaging with a "factious" world, however, the cost might be the forfeit of a natural serenity. From this perspective, private space is not just a court of seclusion, but an epistemological stance that guards against strife and division in search of wholeness. In this transitional period of scientific specu- lation and experiment, with the Royal Society being founded in 166o, Cavendish defined the human soul as material, part of the principle of a world of self-moving, though vitalistic, matter. She abandoned her early atomistic theory for a notion of the commixture between motion and three degrees of nature: rational, sensitive, and inanimate matter. Although these components are self-moving and diverse, "Nature tends to Unity," since "the Eternal matter is always one, and the same . . . and the several degrees do palliate and in some sense make an Equality in infinite."1'3 Cavendish's assumption is of an organic nature with moral and spiritual properties: I bend my self to study nature; and though nature is too specious to be known, yet she is so free as to teach, for every straw, or grain of dust, is a natural tutor, to instruct my sense and reason, and every particular rational creature, is a sufficient School to study in; and our own passions and affections, appetites and desires, are moral Doctors to learn us ... for nature is the chief master; art and education but the under-ushers, in the School of life.14 Turning to nature in search of a rational or moral principle was by no means a new notion. The need to do so in this period partly grew out of the religious conflicts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Dis- putes, persecutions, and wars had afflicted the traditional creed with doubt and controversy, splitting Christianity up into multiple denomi- nations and sects. In consequence, a need arose, during the seventeenth century, to join together in a more reasonable and moderating creed, as reflected in The Blazing World: Then the Empress seeing that the several sorts of her subjects had each their churches apart, asked the priests whether they were of several religions? They answered her Majesty, that there was no more but one religion in all that world, nor no diversity of opinions in that same religion; for though there were sev- eral sorts of men, yet had they all but one opinion concerning the worship and adoration of God. (134-35) This desire for a restored creed, modified by sense and reason, was aug- mented by the scientific movement of the sixteenth and seventeenth 13 Cavendish, Philosophical and Physical Opinions (London, 1655), 4-5. 14 Cavendish, The World's Olio (London, 1655), sig. E2.</page><page sequence="7">Oddvar Holmesland 463 centuries, which gradually exchanged mysterious and supernatural explanations of the universe for the idea of the Great Machine, a ratio- nally working universe of material causation. Yet the materialism of philosophers and scientists such as Descartes, Boyle, Newton, or Bacon was not such as to discard a divine hypothesis. Their attitudes were basically theistic. Sharing the assumption that nature works according to an inherent design, they ultimately regarded science as the study of the manifestation of God's works. Science could therefore collabo- rate with the presuppositions inherited from Christianity to produce notions of apotheosized nature, beliefs that gained ground through the eighteenth century and the Romantic period. Yet Cavendish departs from traditional theistic attitudes by consid- ering the human soul a material part of a world of matter. She states in her preface to The Blazing World that philosophical contemplation aims at establishing truth in terms of "enquiring after the causes of natural effects" (123). In Observations, she suggests that a criterion for regard- ing nature as natural is that God does not impose his order from above: "for in all Figures, Sizes and Actions, is apparent the curious Variety of Nature, and the Omnipotency of the Creator, who has given Nature a self-moving power to produce all these Varieties in her self."'5 This, on the one hand, indicates Cavendish's new-scientist fascination with matter and motion-with self-motion being the basic process in a natu- rally ordered universe. Yet one wonders how she would differentiate between spiritualized and material nature. While dissociating herself from Cartesian dualism, she also disparages the corpuscular theories of many proponents of the new science. Though a materialist, she seems, paradoxically, to share a contemporary inclination to mitigate some of materialism's despiritualizing implications. In her curious way, she hovers between notions of deified nature and the mechanistic basis for the new science. From her corporeal position, Cavendish is aware of an epistemo- logical gap. In The Blazing World, the Empress inquires of the spirits: "is there not divine reason, as well as there is natural?" which the spirits deny, "for there is but a divine faith, and as for reason it is only natu- ral" (167). On one level, The Blazing World adopts scientific perspectives that "do not go beyond what your natural reason can comprehend" (179). With her desire for a holistic vision, however, Cavendish faces the limitation of knowledge derivable from the material. For one thing, 15 Cavendish, Observations, 45.</page><page sequence="8">464 Margaret Cavendish 's The Blazing World she comes to distrust the empirical methodology of the Royal Society, as exemplified in The Blazing World by the telescopes and microscopes: "now I do plainly perceive, that your glasses are false informers, and instead of discovering the truth, delude your senses" (141). Turning her back on this "deluding Art," she announces, "I shall addict my self to the study of Contemplative Philosophy, and Reason shall be my Guide." A mediative motive lies behind, for "seeing that in this Age, Sense is more in fashion than Reason, it is no wonder there are so many irregular Opinions and Judgments amongst men." 16 Her point of departure is that "there is but one truth in nature" (123), and as she maintains in Observations, "I am . . . ambitious of finding out the Truth of Nature.""7 Acknowledging that truth is hardly accessible as empiri- cal fact, she holds that opinions should be grounded upon "rational probabilities" (123). Her position is that of Aristotle, who, in chapter 9 of Poetics, assigns the representation of the "probable" to philosophy and to poetry. Poetry, he thinks, is "a more philosophical and a higher thing than history" due to its capacity to "express the universal."'8 Similarly, Cavendish's "poetical description" is a means of transcend- ing the limitations of empirical observation (224). The exploration of universal nature takes a unifying vision, one that will reconcile subjec- tive worlds. This suggests why the Empress tells the bear-men to break their telescopes and rather use their "natural eyes," for "these tele- scopes caused more differences and divisions amongst them, than ever they had before." The use of reason is embraced also on account of the unifying impact it is assumed to have on its agents. Individuals who shed their "artificial glasses" that produce but "artificial delusions" will be freed to respond to their natural self-motions, and this, in turn, in- duces more natural communal relations among individuals (140, 142). Cavendish's thinking draws on a long tradition of civic humanism, as developed in Renaissance and seventeenth-century readings of clas- sical republican texts. Civic humanism treats human affairs, political and economic, in accordance with a presumed law of the universe. 16 Ibid., 92. 17 Ibid., sig. b3. 18 Aristotle, Poetics, trans. James Hutton (New York: Norton, 1982), 54-55. Referring to Aristotle, Cavendish writes that "the Study [in Natural Philosophy] is onely conjec- turally, and built upon probabilities, and until probabilities be condemned by absolute and known truth, let them have a place amongst the rest of probabilities, and be not so partial to contradict, as to be unjust to me ... for next to the finding out of truthes, the greatest pleasure in Study, is, to finde out probabilities" ("An Epistle to Condemning Readers," in Philosophical and Physical Opinions, 26-27).</page><page sequence="9">Oddvar Holmesland 465 Here one would find wisdom and guidance for moral activity. A divine principle would inscribe itself upon nature, on the heart, and through reason. Thus the inner and the outer would be equally part of the same organizing principle, and one might attend to it by either letting one's own nature, or nature without, inform one of the right course to take. As a civic humanist, Cavendish discusses the theme of natural unity in terms of the metaphor of the healthy body politic, and by definition of the virtues that will preserve and the vices that will threaten the com- mune or state. On the one hand, the Empress's statement that nature's principle is infinite motion suggests that she thinks no ideal form exists in nature. On the other hand, human acts, paradoxically, are deemed natural on the grounds of their socially unifying effect. These are the terms on which The Blazing World sanctions artificial human devices. Artificial forms of progress may assert themselves against nature's elements provided that their motion is naturally, com- munally cohesive. As the Empress-to-be approaches the Blazing World, for instance, the civil creatures of that country take her across the open seas, pitting their united scientific ingenuity against nature's extremes. With their propelling engine, "they forced their passage through ... so that the artificial wind had the better of the natural; for it had a greater advantage of the waves than the natural of the ships . . . the artificial with a sideward motion did pierce into the bowels of the waves." The sailors force themselves on tempestuous nature like a united navy: "they would join their ships in battle array, and when they feared wind and waves would be too strong for them, if they divided their ships, they joined as many together as the compass or advantage of the places of the liquid element would give them leave . . . and being thus united, no wind nor waves were able to separate them" (129). At some am- biguous level, artificial and natural merge; the artificial contrivance seems to accommodate the idea of organically integrating material self- motion. Following the same premises, Cavendish extends the united construct of sailors to the larger form of government: one that curbs di- versity, promotes oneness, and is therefore considered natural, for "as it was natural for one body to have but one head, so it was also natural for a politic body to have but one governor; and . . . a commonwealth, which had many governors was like a monster with many heads" (134). Just as Cavendish writes of the "bowels" of the waves (129), so she uses the term "politic body" to present an organic, unitary state. In Cavendish's utopian vision, the individual self cannot transcend corporeal singularity. Balance is therefore sought in the notion of an</page><page sequence="10">466 Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World organic body. The state as a human family, deified in the image of natu- ral harmony, seems to become the ideal. As is generally the case in civic humanist writings, moreover, the idea of the body politic tends to be closely associated with the formative power of the aristocracy. To the Duchess, of whom the Empress asks advice on the right form of government, the nobility is a better safeguard of sound reason than are the various experimental scientists and philosophers. The nobility is thought to care for the wholeness of society, not just different hobby- horses associated too closely with private ambition and leading to arti- ficial dissension (202). This is the basis for the Duchess's advice to have a monistic, hierarchical social structure with "but one sovereign, one religion, one law, and one language, so that all the world might be but as one united family, without divisions; nay, like God, and his blessed saints and angels" (201). The Empress and the Duchess thus appear with supreme grace, "the vehicles of those two souls being made of the purest and finest sort of air, and of a human shape; this purity and fineness was the cause that they could neither be seen nor heard by any human creature." Also, the "priests and governors were princes of the imperial blood," whereas "the ordinary sort of men"-such as ex- perimental philosophers, astronomers, natural philosophers, chemists, physicians, politicians, mathematicians, orators, logicians, and archi- tects -not only are investigators of material nature, but also have souls composed of that "grosser sort of air" (133, 193). Allegorical dualism is translated into terms of social hierarchy, with a separation between the more spiritual nobility and the earth-bound creatures who have vehicles of a more partial sort: "each followed such a profession as was most proper for the nature of their species" (134). Within this hier- archy ranging from spiritual to material qualities, the Empress assents to the bear-men's view that "there is nothing in nature that can subsist of, or by itself, (I mean singly) by reason all parts of nature are com- posed in one body, and though they may be infinitely divided, com- mixed and changed in their particulars, yet in general, parts cannot be separated from parts as long as nature lasts" (151). A special noblesse oblige consequently goes with the privileges enjoyed by the nobility. Thus the virtues put forward in favor of the Duke of Newcastle are those of "gratitude," "charity," "generosity," "prudence," "temperance," "patience," "justice," "honour," "wisdom," "observation," and "experi- ence" (199). Civic nature, in The Blazing World, provides an ideological correc-</page><page sequence="11">Oddvar Holmesland 467 tive to factionalism, feminist emulation, and self. For instance, the Em- press notes the absence of public roles for women in the Blazing World and decides to build an all-women congregation, recognizing that they "generally had quick wits, subtle conceptions, clear understandings, and solid judgements" (162). Yet she worries that emancipation will tempt them to give up community thinking, that they will begin "fol- lowing their own fancies, and living according to their own desires" (163). A similar ambivalence attends her attitude towards the place of luxury in society. On the one hand, luxury is the rightful emblem of a high position: "None was allowed to use or wear gold but those of the imperial race, which were the only nobles of the state; nor durst anyone wear jewels but the Emperor, the Empress, and their eldest son" (133). But luxury needs to be tempered by frugality in order for the natu- ral compact to be observed. The Empress regards wealth as a potential source of corruption: "not only particular families or nations, but all the world, their natures are such, that much gold, and great store of riches makes them mad, insomuch as they endeavour to destroy each other for gold, or riches' sake." When the Duchess proposes that "the reason thereof is . . . that they have too little gold and riches, which makes them so eager to have it," the Empress corrects her: "their par- ticular covetousness is beyond all the wealth of the richest world, and the more riches they have, the more covetous they are, for their covet- ousness is infinite" (217). "Moderation," she declares, is the universal key to happiness, and that which best serves the body politic (191). The Empress also checks other signs of private excess. She thinks the Duchess puts too much value on her "singularity," warning that "if you were not a great lady ... you would never pass in the world for a wise lady; for the world would say your singularities are vanities" (218). The Duchess's desire for singularity inclines her to dream of chivalric exploits in the fashion of the seventeenth-century French romances (a subversion of gender roles): "for I had rather die in the adventure of noble achievements, than live in obscure and sluggish security; since by the one, I may live in a glorious fame, and by the other I am buried in oblivion." The spirits frown upon such ambition and hold that "con- querers seldom enjoy their conquest, for they being more feared than loved, most commonly come to an untimely end." Besides, "the spirits answered, that the lives of fame were like other lives; for some lasted long, and some died soon." They recommend more sobriety and mod- eration, for, "replied the spirits, if occasion does not serve you, you</page><page sequence="12">468 Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World must content yourself to live without such achievements that may gain you a fame" (185).'9 There is, however, the question of how much irony is implied in this advice to the Duchess. Admittedly, it stands in curious opposition to the seeming lack of temperance characterizing the author in her own life. There are ample accounts of her craving for fame, both as a scien- tist and a writer, of her competitiveness in the masculine public sphere, of her ostentatious dress, extravagance, and propensity for personal excess.20 Correspondingly, the Empress, in her display of sovereignty, often seems to set herself above the virtues of moderation. However, this is only one side of a more complex disposition. The Blazing World is not just a surrogate place for living out unproportionate ambitions. It is also a dialectic form in which self-aggrandizing motives engender a communal, natural corrective. Cavendish claims in The World's Olio that "the evil that follows excesse, teaches us what is bad, and by modera- tion we finde, and do so learn what is good, and how we ought to live." Moderation as well as reason is a "natural capacity," and according to Cavendish, "natural rules of life, may lead us safe, and easy wayes to our journeys end; and questionlesse nature was the first guide." She maintains that ""many will say it is the nature of man that invents, and the nature of man to erre; that is, tis the nature of man to be so ambi- tious, as to strive to be wiser then nature her self, but if nature hath given men ambition, yet nature hath given men humilitie to allay that fiery appetite."2" Her image of a restored England makes room for self- 19 Lilley, in contrast, finds the romance aspect more dominant, according to which "Cavendish's Empress is a kind of warrior queen" ("Seventeenth-Century Women's Uto- pian Writing," 1l9). 20 Cavendish seems fully aware of her need to display herself for fame: "I always took delight in a singularity, even in acoutrements of habits" ("A True Relation of my Birth, Breeding, and Life," in Nature's Pictures Drawn by Fancies Pencil to the Life [London, 1656], 387). Elsewhere, she declares that "if my Writing please the Readers, though not the Learned, it wil satisfie me.... For all - desire, is Fame" ("To all Noble, and Worthy Ladies," in Poems, and Fancies [London, 16531, sig. A3). John Evelyn describes how he came "to waite on the Dutchesse of New-Castle (who was a mighty pretender to Learning, Poetry &amp; Philosophie ... ) to the Royal Society, whither she came in greate pomp" (The Diary of John Evelyn, ed. E. S. de Beer, rev. ed., 6 vols. [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 19551, 3:482- 83). Samuel Pepys also observes her: "Met my Lady Newcastle, going with her coaches and footmen all in velvet; herself (whom I never saw before) as I have heard her often described (for all the town-talk is nowadays of her extravagancies)" (Diary, ed. Robert Latham and William Matthews, rev. ed., ii vols. [London: G. Bell and Sons, 19741, 8: i86 [26 April 16671). 21 Cavendish, "Epistle," The World's Olio, sig. E2. This notion of a natural balance can be seen to subscribe to the ideals of Renaissance humanism. Thus Jean Gagen stresses</page><page sequence="13">Oddvar Holmesland 469 creation, but in the service of a natural balance. Thus the spirits advise the Empress against wielding a regime to gratify her private fancies and desires. The consequence would be to usurp the world whose mutual relations depend on organic self-motion. As a viable alterna- tive, Cavendish has the spirits propose immoderate personal ambition transferred to the realm of the imagination, which will neither extort the body politic nor cause personal dissatisfaction due to ungratified wishes. The Duchess and the Empress experience the triumph of sov- ereignty in their fanciful worlds, as does the author herself in creating the textual empire of The Blazing World. Fancy and imagination provide compensation for their lack of power in England-and especially for being women. In the preface to The Blazing World, Cavendish crowns herself "Margaret the First," since "I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the Second," "and although I have neither power, time nor occasion to conquer the world as Alexander and Caesar did; yet rather than not to be mistress of one, since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I have made a world of my own" (124). This might, admittedly, seem like an ironic statement on a society that disempowers ambitious women.- However, it does not fail to acknowledge imaginative creation as the safety valve for unrestricted self-fashioning, which may decompose a naturally balanced relation to the world. Besides offering surrogate routes to self-aggrandizement, imagina- tive creation, for Cavendish, allows scope for self-management. This move, obviously, is in reaction to a society ruled by men, but the course she aims to follow is that of nature as much as that of personal fame and success. She sees nature's free motion as analogous to that of the free mind: Cavendish's vacillation between her self-centered craving for fame and her "avowed in- tent of winning fame in accordance with the ideals of Renaissance humanism," which made fame more or less a synonym for honor: both "an inner quality-virtue or the love of virtue" and "an outward quality-the reward or public recognition given to outstand- ing virtue or merit." Gagen suggests that Cavendish "by her own confession ... was guilty of 'ambition.' She had crossed the fine line dividing the laudable desire to win honor through meritorious deeds from the 'insatiable greed of glory,' which was a com- mon seventeenth century definition of ambition. Though ambition sometimes was used as a synonym for emulation or aspiration, it was more often regarded with dark suspicion as a sin of excess, a breeder of mischief, even of tragedy and bloodshed. One of the dis- arming things about Margaret Cavendish, however, is the fact that one can seldom con- vict her of anything of which she has not already convicted herself" ("Honor and Fame in the Works of the Duchess of Newcastle," Studies in Philology 56 119591: 520-22, 530-31). 22 This is the position of several critics; see, for instance, Todd, The Sign of Angellica, 68; Williamson, Raising Their Voices, 40, 58; and Gallagher, "Embracing the Absolute," 27.</page><page sequence="14">470 Margaret Cavendish 's The Blazing World All the External motion in a Figure, is, by the sensitive spirits; and all the internal, by the rational spirits: and when the rational and sensitive spirits, disagree in oppo- site figures, by contrary motion, they oft war upon one another; ... all regular mo- tion is pleasure, and delight, being Harmony of Motion, or a discord of Motion.23 Cavendish wants the inner and the outer to be in accord, and this is one reason why she embraces Natural Philosophy: "since, espe- cially in Natural Philosophy, Opinions have Freedome, I hope these my Opinions may also Injoy the same Liberty and Privilege that others have, which without great Injustice no Body can Deny me."24 Self- management and mental and imaginary freedom are mutually contin- gent, which is partly the reason why the Empress, in her wish to be "Authoress of a whole world," extends the offer to her subjects that they may "create worlds of their own, and govern themselves as they please: but yet let them have a care, not to prove unjust usurpers, and to rob me of mine" (224-25). Critics have read this as expressing her desire for subjects who will "ratify her independent sovereignty."25 However, her attitude also has crucial epistemological implications. Self-management is to be able to order and make sense of one's world in what is taken to be nature's way. Under her monistic regime, therefore, the Empress treasures a world that is "curious and full of variety" (188). And relying on her rational motions, Cavendish, in The Blazing World, creates a complex blend of theological, romantic, fantastic, scientifi- cally experimental, and philosophically speculative modes-a kind of "hybridization." Rather than simply serve as a "model of surpassing," this is the creative imagination's way of rearranging the world in its rich variety. Cavendish's political and artistic preoccupations mesh. In Observations, she maintains that "Art produces Hermaphroditical Effects, that is, such as are partly Natural, and partly Artificial," yet "Art it self is natural, and an effect of Nature, and cannot produce any thing that is beyond, or not within Nature."26 The following statement by the Duchess specifically draws the connection between singularity and having a free creative space: "I endeavour ... to be as singular as I can; for it argues but a mean nature to imitate others" (218).27 Being 23 Cavendish, Philosophical and Physical Opinions, 15. 24 Cavendish, epistle to "Noble Readers" (following Preface), Philosophical and Physical Opinions, 2d ed.

Cavendish's concern to inspire a liberated understanding of reality links her to the new philosophers. Freeing the mind is seen as a prerequisite for discovering truth, but also for transcending limited earthly perspectives. She aims her inquiry at the mystical sphere of "divine faith," wondering if it could be replaced by "divine reason," a higher form of "natural reason" (167). What she needs to grasp is an organic principle to intercede between material partialness and theo- logical mysticism. Faith, on the other hand, only substitutes subjective speculation for the "natural rational," which is why Cavendish gives up making the Jews' Cabbala accord to a "mystical interpretation of the scripture." Dissension, moreover, is the likely consequence when people "make interpretations every one according to his own fancy." She also considers and rejects a "moral Cabbala," because it requires mental submission sooner than liberated understanding, telling one "but to fear God, and to love his neighbour, and this needs no further interpretation." Nor does a "political Cabbala," the basis of which is merely "reward and punishment" (182-83). For Cavendish, in order to better comprehend universal nature, sub- jective minds must attune themselves to the natural motions running through themselves rather than take over the versions of the world made by others. Some concord between inner and outer nature is re- quired. Creative freedom to order one's own mind thus emerges as a prerequisite, which the Duchess learns when first trying to model her Cabbala on the received opinions of the ancient philosophers. Their ideas appear artificial, too "wedded to their own opinions" (181). In following Thales, she feels forced by the "demons" of his opinion to "obey their orders and commands"; adopting "Pythagoras's doctrine," her mind is "puzzled with numbers, how to order and compose the several parts"; the opinion of Plato causes her equal difficulty, "for the numerous Ideas having no other motion but what was derived from her mind, whence they did flow and issue out, made it a far harder business to her, to impart motion to them, than puppet-players have in giving motion to every several puppet"; and starting to make a world according to the opinion of Epicurus, "the infinite atoms made such a mist, that it quite blinded the perception of her mind." The individual mind is not a tabula rasa, and it finds meaning neither in obeying the ideas of other thinkers nor in indiscriminately receiving the "atoms"</page><page sequence="16">472 Margaret Cavendish s The Blazing World of such ideas as building material for subjective ideas. The Duchess is far from "able to make a vacuum as a receptacle for those atoms, or a place which they might retire into" (187). Faring no better when following Aristotle's opinion, the Duchess then shifts from the ancient to the modern philosophers who treat subjective cognition as starting point. Yet having "made the ethereal globules, and set them a-moving by a strong and lively imagination," they turn round so fast that they make her stagger. Hobbes's opinion, for instance, inspires no coherent thinking on her part. His idea of a primitive and fundamental power struggle in nature fills her with dis- ruptive presuppositions: "when all the parts of this imaginary world came to press and drive each other, they seemed like a company of wolves that worry sheep, or like so many dogs that hunt after hares; and when she found a reaction equal to those pressures, her mind was so squeezed together, that her thoughts could neither move forward nor backward" (i88). Hobbes's opinion imposes artificial categories on the Duchess's mind, arresting its natural motions, and thus its capacity for perceiving unity. Only when the mind is allowed to apprehend the world according to its own unifying motions can it perceive a natu- ral principle. Cavendish makes a case for a natural method of study in Philosophical and Physical Opinions: Tis true, moral Philosophy is an excellent Study, but the doctrine is too strict for the practise, for it teaches more then can be followed, and Theologie is a glorious Study, but the way is difficult and dangerous, for though there are many pathes, yet there is but one that leads to heaven, and those that step awrie fall into the Gulph of damnation, and the deep study in this many times blindes the eyes, both of faith and reason, and instead of uniting mankind with love, to live in peace, it makes discords with controversies, raises up faction to uphold each-side, whose endlesse quarrels are followed with such hatred, and fought with such malice and envie, and the zeal spits so much blood, as if not onely several parties would be rased out, but the bulk of mankinde; And to study Law, is to study dissention, to study Logick is to Study deceit, to make falshood appear like truth; to study Rhetorick is to study words more then sense, and many the like studies are more painful then useful, more time lost then profit got, more tedious then pleasant, more sophistry then truth. But through the liberating study of natural philosophy, Cavendish learns, the mind may get to know itself in the self-ordering image of nature: above all, this Study is a great delight, and pleases the curiosity of mens minds, it carries their thoughts above vulgar and common Objects, it elevates their</page><page sequence="17">Oddvar Holmesland 473 Spirits to an aspiring pitch; It gives room for the untired appetites of man, to walk or run in, for so Spatious it is, that it is beyond the compasse of time; ... neither doth it binde up man to those strickt rules as other Sciances do, it gives them an honest liberty, and proves temperance is the greatest pleasure in nature328 Correspondingly, the Duchess in The Blazing World finally learns how to liberate her creative mind, and then "rational self-moving matter ... did move to the creation of the imaginary world" (188). Cavendish's artistic empire correlates with the Empress's govern- mental one in that they both seek to break down artificial conceptions of the world. On these terms, the Empress aspires to make the Blaz- ing World a model for, as well as a contrast to, the world from which she came. There are recurrent comments on the intolerable situation in England (referred to as 'E" or "ESFI") after the Civil War. When the souls of the Empress and the Duchess pay a visit to their native coun- try, they look for natural art forms, but in vain. Just as the opinions of others make it impossible for the Duchess to create her Cabbala, so the post-Civil War theater presents plays that "were taken out of old stories"-variations on a set mode. To the Empress, the result is hetero- geneous and unbalanced. She observes "that the actors make a better show than the spectators, and the scenes a better than the actors, and the music and dancing is more pleasant and acceptable than the play itself." Separate parts of the performance dominate over the whole. As for artistic "relation," she says, "our poets defy and condemn it into a chimney-corner" (191-92). A new realism is called for, one that trans- gresses the set mode and offers a correlative to the natural motions within the mind. Art's form must be natural, says the Emperor, so that it can "describe ... the natural humours, actions and fortunes of man- kind" (220).29 Cavendish remarks in The World's Olio that "questionlesse nature was the first guide, before art came to the knowledge, and if it 28 Cavendish, "An Epistle to the Reader, for my Book of Philosophy," in Philosophical and Physical Opinions (1655 edition), sig. a-a2. 29 This attitude points towards what Ian Watt sees as the realist novelist's position in the early eighteenth century: "Defoe and Richardson are the first great writers in our literature who did not take their plots from mythology, history, legend or previous lit- erature. In this they differ from Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare and Milton, for instance, who, like the writers of Greece and Rome, habitually used traditional plots; and who did so, in the last analysis, because they accepted the general premise of their times that, since Nature is essentially complete and unchanging, its records, whether scriptural, legend- ary or historical, constitute a definitive repertoire of human experience" (The Rise of the Novel: Studies in Defoe, Richardson and Fielding, rev. ed. [London: Hogarth Press, 19871, 14).</page><page sequence="18">474 Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World were not for nature, art many times would lose her followers." ' She leans towards the philosophical realist movement of the seventeenth century. The reasoning mind becomes the starting point which artistic form should accommodate. Paradoxically, Cavendish relies on natural relation and finds its ideal embodiment within an aristocratic discourse. Nature and ideological circumscription appear entangled. To Cavendish, "reason searches the depth of nature, and enquires after the true causes of natural effects," but she seems to have a preconception that those natural effects best manifest themselves in the graceful relations of the nobility (123). Within her image of the body politic, she seeks to demystify the spiri- tual, and the nobility may be the closest thing to spiritualized figures available on earth. The paradox is brought into relief after the dis- concertment of the Empress's soul, while in England, upon watching the incongruous play modeled on an artificial mode. There is an im- mediate shift to the court, where she meets "the King, the Queen, and all the royal race." She is amazed, because nowhere has she "found so much majesty and affability mixed so exactly together, that none did overshadow or eclipse the other." They are seen to possess various virtues "mixed so exactly together" that the whole expresses the true balance assumed to exist in nature, and to be represented in true art. Their natural dignity transcends shifting times and conventions, seem- ing to embody a divine harmony and a wit bestowed by "celestial in- structors" (192). What is interesting is that Cavendish does not perceive the royalty in terms of the set mode of a hierarchical order as much as in terms of the gracious balance that the mind needs in order to freely perceive harmony in nature. From this perspective, the royal person- ages are transcribed into metaphoric figures for an ideal state of mind. The rational and the celestial seem to be held in "hybridized" balance. Indeed, the entire seat of the Empress is the epitome of an artistic form that bears on balance and moderation, a correlative of the mind in its idealized state. The Duchess perceives its natural tranquillity from her position in England: as the sun's light is hot, so their light is cool, not so cool as our twinkling star- light, nor is their sun-light so hot as ours, but more temperate; and that part of the Blazing World where the Empress resides, is always clear, and never sub- ject to any storms, tempests, fogs or mists, but has only refreshing dews that 30 Cavendish, "Epistle," The World's Olio, sig. E2.</page><page sequence="19">Oddvar Holmesland 475 nourish the earth; the air of it is sweet and temperate, and, as I said before, as much light in the sun's absence, as in its presence. (222) The art of the royalty is so finely attuned to the whole that no one form seems awry. Thus "their music, both vocal and instrumental, is accord- ing to their several places: upon the water it is of water instruments, as shells filled with water, and so moved by art, which is a sweet and delightful harmony." Similarly, "those dances which they dance upon the water, are, for the most part such as we in this world call swim- ming dances, where they do not lift up their feet high." Every art form is delicately adjusted to its context, so that when music or dancing is performed "in lawns or upon plains they have wind instruments ... and when they dance in the woods they have horn instruments ... and as their places of dancing and their music is different, so is their man- ner or way of dancing" (223). "By this poetical description," including that of The Blazing World as a whole, Cavendish makes her own Cabbala. As master creator, she re- quires freedom to make her world "of peace and tranquility" according to "the rational figures of [her] mind" (224). Rewriting the convention- ridden art propounded by the contemporary theater wits, she arrives at a poetic form that allows her to "use metaphors, allegories, simili- tudes, etc. and interpret them as you please" (183). Only when enjoying such creative freedom can the mind grasp the balanced variety of a natural form. Cavendish treats art as an epistemological medium, the reason why "both the Blazing and the other Philosophical World ... are framed and composed of the most pure, that is, the rational parts of matter, which are the parts of my mind" (224). Poetic freedom allows individuals the opportunity of hybridized self-creation. The scope ex- tends beyond that of a compensatory safety valve to gratify the lust for absolute sovereignty. Rather, Cavendish presents poetic freedom as a starting point for restoring natural relations among people. She seems to believe that the creative imagination, if freed from "artificial" opin- ions and patterns, may find a natural course as well as yield a fuller vision of the world. But epistemological paradoxes undercut Cavendish's holism. Not only does she lean on an aristocratic discourse for an image of nature's own course, but she also attempts to mediate between spiritual and corporeal qualities by translating the former into the "effects, or rather actions of the rational parts of matter" (123-24). The problem of where natural reason ends and faith begins emerges. Cavendish anticipates</page><page sequence="20">476 Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World this problem when the spirits tell the Empress, "you mortals are so puzzled about this divine faith, and natural reason, that you do not know well how to distinguish them, but confound them both" (167). Cavendish inclines towards categorical instability in an age of turmoil and transition. In The Blazing World, she seeks to make romance and allegory accessible as rational patterns. The paradox comes to a head in the Empress's descent to her native world in the shape of a divinity. Wanting to introduce the regime of her Blazing World, she depends on the submissive awe with which she can strike rulers and citizens alike. The Empress's coming is particularly ambiguous in that she artfully imposes an allegorico-providential pattern on the world. For instance, she resorts to tricks in order not to be detected by her opponents as she approaches, having had her ships painted black "so that the natural colour of the gold could not be perceived through the artificial colour of the paint, no not by the best telescopes" (208). Significantly, the in- habitants of her native world fail to account for her coming by empiri- cal science; their instruments cannot penetrate to the "natural" splen- dor behind the painted coat of appearances. From a corporeal point of view, the implication might be that only by extending their "hybridiz- ing" imaginations, which count as rational, will they know her. Yet this raises the question of whether her regime does not, after all, depend on her subjects' faith in the power of mystery rather than on their natural reason. Thus "the Empress appeared with garments made of the star- stone" and "seemed to walk upon the face of the water ... in her gar- ments of light, like an angel, or some deity, and all kneeled down before her, and worshipped her with all submission and reverence" (210). But Cavendish wants this image of a shining angel walking upon the water to be explicable by the standards of her Blazing World, for the prop- erty of the fire-stone is such that it burns so long as it is wet, and the Empress is being supported above the water upon the fish-men's heads and backs (207, 210). The supernatural is made to subscribe to physical causes, not divine miracles. Nevertheless, the happening finally serves as a test of faith, and so the impact on the Empress's countrymen does not linger long after she is gone: "some said she was an angel; others, she was a sorceress; some believed her a goddess; others said the devil deluded them in the shape of a fine lady" (211). More comings, more breathtaking than the first, are needed to quench diverse opinions and turn doubt into either devotion or submission. Having achieved her goal, she bestows "absolute power" on the rightful king of England and makes him "the head-monarch of all this world." Monism is restored to</page><page sequence="21">Oddvar Holmesland 477 the mother country and its dominions, modeled on the Blazing World. In her speech, the Empress presents herself, in allegorical fashion, as a harbinger of Heaven, whose coming had been necessary because the king's enemies had unjustly tried to "take away his hereditary rights and prerogatives,' instituted by God, "at which unjustice Heaven was much displeased" (216). This providential manner completes the circle for the young lady, she having been led by gods to the Blazing World in the first place. The importance the Empress attributes to natural self-motion in the Blazing World makes an uneasy match with her allegorico-romantic ascension and coming, especially in light of the authority she assumes over her textual empire as "Authoress of a whole world" (224). The Empress regards her regime as largely depending on the love of her subjects, with herself as the instigator of this natural motion. Her rule should therefore not be too imposing, for she knows that "fear, though it makes people obey, yet does it not last so long, nor is it so sure a means to keep them to their duties, as love." Returning to earth, how- ever, she sways people with a love that is more like the awe felt before a deity. Ironically, no rational self-ordering seems possible without their faith in her as a goddess. Another contradiction emerges: the Empress seems calculatingly aware that she is swaying them by means of an illu- sion. We read that "by art, and her own ingenuity," she keeps her sub- jects "in a constant belief" (164). Although Cavendish's "philosophical" writing bears on "natural reason," as distinguished from "divine faith," the Blazing World depends on the latter for rational ordering (167). There is an interesting analogue between this governmental form and Cavendish's literary form. Despite the professed richness and variety of either-a tribute to nature-both are conceived within the bounds of religious allegory (i88). The natural course to which Cavendish ascribes her utopian vision is in need of authorial overrule. Correspondingly, she also lets provi- dential patterning intervene to direct natural motion. The Blazing World reveals the author's quest to reconcile the dualism between the spiri- tual and the material. Michael McKeon comments on the problem of mediation in this age: In the early modern period, modes like religious allegory gradually ceased to offer the comfort of a mediating unity and came to propound instead a dualistic and seemingly insoluble problem of mediation. In fact, the early novelists can be seen as struggling toward a form that would defetishize the spirit by freeing it from the realm of the ideal, whence it might descend to inhabit the world of</page><page sequence="22">478 Margaret Cavendish's The Blazing World human relations, the material ground on which the real battle against the dead- ening materialization of the spirit would have to be fought out in future times.31 The Blazing World construes nature as a kind of dialectic intercessor, but with an unresolved mandate. Its holistic quest encounters the prob- lem of having only limited vision through nature. To compensate, the Empress relies on immaterial spirits to whom she sends her fly- and bird-men to consult about matters of truth. The nobility in England- such as the Duke of Newcastle-are similarly aided by beings who "are somewhat like spirits, because they are immaterial, although their ac- tions are corporeal" (196). Yet the knowledge of the spirits is but partial, which makes the Duchess lament that "spirits are as ignorant as mortals in many cases; for no created spirits have a general or absolute knowl- edge, nor can they know the thoughts of men, much less the mysteries of the great creator, unless he be pleased to inspire into them the gift of divine knowledge" (182). Nor are the spirits able to lend spiritualized direction to nature's course, as is confirmed when the Empress asks them whether they can "give motion to natural bodies? No, answered they. . . for we spirits, being incorporeal, have no motion but from our corporeal vehicles, so that we move by the help of our bodies, and not the bodies by the help of us; for pure spirits are immovable" (168). Along with the increasingly scientific outlook of the mid-seventeenth century, The Blazing World reflects a materialist quest to comprehend the spiritual. A mediative hybrid genre thus translates divine mysti- cism into supernaturalism and magic, which are presented as being within the range of rational probability, yet not, unqualifiedly, as the effect of natural self-motion. It takes an authoritative master creator. In fashioning a new nature, Cavendish interiorizes some of God's wide powers. Her wish to be "Authoress of a whole world" feeds into her figuring of the romance ascension of the Empress, and there are hints of a vicarious desire for personal glory that refers to spiritual allegory as well as aristocratic ideology (224). Contradictory impulses mark Cavendish's utopian project, but it is important that the critic not stress one of them at the expense of the way in which they interact dialectically. It is too confining, for instance, to sum up The Blazing World as the imaginary voyage of an imperialist self. Rather, the imperialist vision - the image of the expanded self- also marks a widening artistic and epistemological space. Beyond the 31 Michael McKeon, The Origins of the English Novel, 1600-1740, 2d ed. (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), 312.</page><page sequence="23">Oddvar Holmesland 479 bounds of self, as end in itself, there is an idealized level at which self- creation is presumed to follow natural motion. Cavendish's holism thus serves as a corrective against excessive personal ambition, sus- tained by civic virtues and liberality. This is the way in which artistic creation can be seen to make a tribute to nature's own restoration of En- gland and its dominions. The fact that this natural corrective has many fissures seems to be partly the result of Cavendish's personal preten- tiousness, but it is also the mark of an age that did not clearly separate notions of natural self-motion from magic and spiritual allegory.
