Nicholas Russell's Like engend'ring like attempts to account for improvements in the breeding of horses, cattle, and sheep in England from the late middle ages through the eighteenth century, with the focus on the later years. His declared purpose is both to describe the ways in which the various breeds changed during the period and to query whether those changes were due to planned breeding strategies or to better methods of husbandry. The major subtext of Russell's book is to account for the development of planned, "scientific breeding. " To set up his account, early chapters include both current scientific theories of breeding, and Greek and Roman theories of generation and inheritance. Russell's overarching thesis is that even before the advent of the late eighteenth-century "agricultural revolution, " market forces began to make breeders more concerned with selecting for specific characteristics in domestic animals, with some planned successes. Russell's book will be of some use to those interested in early modern English agriculture, since from a number of manuscript and printed sources he has developed a clear, if tentative, description of the development of the various breeds of the three most important species of domestic livestock. His descrip</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 223 tions of developments in the eighteenth century, when the market-orientation of breeders led to the keeping of extensive records, are detailed enough to let one see the intentions of the breeders and the results they obtained, especially in his accounts of the development of the thoroughbred horse and Robert Bakewell's innovations in cattle and sheep. His arguments concerning early assumptions about animal husbandry are somewhat less useful. The chapter on classical theories of generation is a rather wooden summary of ancient opinion, in which the ancients are condemned for not understanding modern theories of breeding. Nor does the author make clear the connections he believes are present between theories of generation in the early modern period, such as those of William Harvey, and stockbreeding. The concerns of contemporaries for the breeding of birds and dogs, where many ideas about changes in animal types were developed, do not figure into his story at all, while other ideas, such as consulting astrological signs before mating animals or the ways in which mark ings signified animal temperaments, are dismissed as "fabrications" and irrele vant to the story of scientific breeding. Still other early ideas are transformed by Russell into modern theories, as when the classical distinction between the natural and the artificial becomes a "nature/nurture" problem, and the idea that animals and humans had common physiologies becomes an "anthropomorphic" view. When he speaks of contemporary events on a larger canvas, Russell's arguments are diminished by historical naivet√©: for instance, comparisons be tween Henry VIII's and Elizabeth I's stables are made as if the two monarchs were equal in interests and resources. In short, for a description of the rise of the progenitors of some modern livestock breeds, Russell's book is useful; but for an account of the ways in which ideas and practices influenced one another, the reader must continue to look elsewhere.</page></plain_text>
