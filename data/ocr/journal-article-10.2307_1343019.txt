<plain_text><page sequence="1">Critical Response I Methodological Repression and/or Strategies of Containment Kenneth Burke Fredric Jameson's exacting essay, "The Symbolic Inference; or, Kenneth Burke and Ideological Analysis" (Critical Inquiry 4 [Spring 1978]: 507- 23) moves me to comment. I shall apply one of the charges of my title to him, he applies the other to me. The matter is further complicated by the fact that there is a distance at which they are hard to tell apart. For any expression of something implies a repression of something else, and any statement that goes only so far is analyzable as serving to forestall a statement that goes farther. And I can't go as far as I think I should if I share with Jameson what I take to be his over investment in the term "ideology." The situation lines up thus: in a biographical notice (p. 508) we are told that Jameson is "the author of the forthcoming work, The Politi- cal Unconscious: Studies in the Ideology of Form." Near the end of his essay, Jameson speaks of "Burke's strange reluctance to pronounce the word ideology itself" (p. 521). And Burke's failure to go far enough with the term as Jameson uses it is interpreted as Burke's "strategy of contain- ment." In two of my books, published twenty years apart, I do spe- cifically build upon the term which has so important a place in Jameson's universe of discourse. But he has proved reluctant to quote even a single sentence in which I do pronounce the word. In referring to "methodological repression" I here have in mind what could be called a "strategy of containment," particularly inasmuch as he puts such empha- sis upon my relation to the term. The "repression" involves two stages since my use of the term in- volves two stages. And Jameson states his task thus: "I want to determine 0093-1896/78/0502-0011$ 1.37 401</page><page sequence="2">402 Critical Response Kenneth Burke whether his work can be reread or rewritten as a model for contempo- rary ideological analysis, or what in my own terminology I prefer to call the study of the ideology of form: the analysis, in other words, of the linguistic, narrative, or purely formal ways in which ideology expresses itself through and inscribes itself in the literary text" (p. 509). Since he is to test his translation without telling you what he is translating, I must offer some quotations, to unrepress the repression. In my first book of criticism (Counter-Statement [1931; rev. ed., 1953, rpt. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1968]), my theory of literary form is largely concerned with the role of an "ideology" in the arousing and fulfilling of an audience's expectations. The issue comes to a focus in such sections as, "Form and Ideology" (pp. 146-47); "Re-individuation of forms" (pp. 148-49); and "Ideology" (pp. 161-63). Here are some representative lines, quoted from page 161: Expanding our earlier discussion of ideology: If people believe something, the poet can use this belief to get an effect. If they despise treachery, for instance, he can awaken their detestation by the portrait of a traitor. If they admire self-sacrifice, he can set them to admiring by a tragedy of self-sacrifice. If they hold the earth the center of the universe, he can base the dignity of man upon geocentricity. By an ideology is meant the nodus of beliefs and judgments which the artist can exploit for his effects. Various implications of the term are considered. Some beliefs may be stable enough to become the marks of a whole "culture." "Gener- ally, the ideology of an individual is a slight variant of the ideology distinguishing the class among which he arose" (p. 162). "An ideology is an aggregate of beliefs sufficiently at odds with one another to justify opposite kinds of conduct." Some assumptions can be exploited to dis- credit other assumptions. Thus an author "may use the assumptions of natural beauty to rout the industrialist's assumptions of progress-or vice versa. It is by such aligning of assumptions that poetry contributes to the formation of attitudes, and thus to the determining of conduct" (p. 163). I offer observations (pp. 163-65) on ways in which the formal Kenneth Burke's previous contributions to Critical Inquiry are "Dancing with Tears in My Eyes" (September 1974), "Post-Poesque Der- ivation of a Terministic Cluster" (Winter 1977), "(Nonsymbolic) Motion/ (Symbolic) Action" (Summer 1978), and a hermeneutic fantasy, "A Criti- cal Load ..." (Autumn 1978). He would like us to mention that William Willeford, the interlocutor of a section in "(Nonsymbolic) Motion/ (Symbolic) Action," is a professor of English at the University of Wash- ington.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 403 appeal of literary works becomes tied in with "subject-matter 'charged' by the reader's situation outside the work of art," as per the section on "The Symbolically and formally 'charged.' " There I use the term "ideol- ogy" to designate that contextual aspect of artistic appeal. The ninety pages comprising the "Lexicon Rhetoricae" and "Applications of the Terminology" aim at a "codification" of these issues. It's quite possible that Jameson never read my discussion of "form and ideology" in Counter-Statement (and it has many more aspects than I can spare the time and space for here). In any case, under the circum- stances his presentation of the case functions as "methodological repres- sion." For since he is differentiating his position from mine in these matters, obviously the proper expository procedure would require that he explicitly "report" my statement of my position (preferably at least somewhat in my own terms) and then proceed to demolish it as he sees fit. Surely Jameson is not asking his readers to take the sheer Quietus as a "model" for his way of "rereading" or "rewriting" a text. The other book in which I deal specifically with the term "ideology" is A Rhetoric of Motives (1950; rpt. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1969). Here things are quite different. For somewhere along the line I had read Marx's The German Ideology-and I'm sure that my report (not Jameson's!) will help you see what happened. My dealings with the term here form an integral part of my thesis that, although Aristotle'sRhetoric remains as enviable a text as it ever was, and I still view it as our central text, the term "persuasion" did not cover the ground that I felt should be part of a modem rhetoric. To this end I proposed the term "identification," not as a substitute for the traditional approach but as "an accessory to the standard lore" (A Rhetoric of Motives, p. xiv). With reference to "The Identifying Nature of Property," I reasoned the matter thus (pp. 23-24): Metaphysically, a thing is identified by its properties. In the realm of Rhetoric, such identification is frequently by property in the most materialistic sense of the term, economic property.... ... In the surrounding of himself with properties that name his number or establish his identity, man is ethical. ... Man's moral growth is organized through properties, properties in goods, in services, in position or status, in citizenship, in reputation, in ac- quaintanceship and love. But however ethical such an array of identifications may be when considered in itself, its relation to other entities that are likewise forming their identity in terms of property can lead to turmoil and discord. Here is par excellence a topic to be considered in a rhetoric having "identification" as its key term. And we see why one should expect to get much insight from Marxism, as a study of capitalistic rhetoric.... (And we know of no better way to quickly glimpse the range of rhetoric than to read, in succession, the articles on "Property" and "Propaganda" in The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences.)</page><page sequence="4">404 Critical Response Kenneth Burke In any case, what follows is the kind of material in my Rhetoric of Motives that, whether by deliberate reluctance or by oversight, gets "methodologically repressed" in Jameson's "rewriting" of my dealings with the word ideology. On page 104 I offer seven definitions of "ideology," beginning with the critique of ideas in a Platonic dialogue (I cite Hitler's Mein Kampf as another kind). The sixth definition may or may not be relevant: "The kind of verbalizing done by a statesman, home from a discordant con- ference with foreign diplomats. In a 'confidential' radio talk he gives the people a 'frank and simple report of the facts.' But the report is scrupu- lously designed to allow them no inkling of how the matter looks from the other side." The seventh unreported definition is presented thus: An inverted genealogy of culture, that makes for "illusion" and "mystification" by treating ideas as primary where they should have been treated as derivative. This last meaning is the most difficult. But because Marxism is a materialist revision of Hegel's idealism, not only do the authors of The German Ideology take their start from this seventh definition, they continually circle back to it. If we understand this special us- age, we can see why a Marxist might legitimately object when, after he has attacked his political opponents as "ideologists," they retort by calling Marxism an "ideology" too. In the special sense of the word, as used in The German Ideology, it is quite true that the schools there selected for attack are "ideologies," while Marxism is not. On the subject of "Ideology in General, German Philosophy in Par- ticular," the second paragraph of The German Ideology begins: "The first premise of all human history is of course the existence of living human individuals. The first fact to be established is therefore the physical or- ganization of these individuals and their consequent relation to the rest of nature." In my section on La Rochefoucauld (pp. 146-49), I note how the individualist aspect of the Maxims can be analyzed as an "ideology," insofar as the strategic concept of "self-love" involves identification with a "courtly morality." But at the same time, in my view of the physiologi- cal organism as a principle of individuation, as I state at the start of my essay on "(Nonsymbolic) Motion/(Symbolic) Action" (Critical Inquiry 4 [Summer 1978]: 809-38), I locate the individual (as distinct from the kind of "ideological" identity that is intended in a social term, such as "indi- vidualism") in the human body, the "original economic plant," distinct from all others owing to the divisive centrality of each body's particular nervous system. Jameson's reference to "the bodily elements, as it were the physio- logical infrastructure, of the literary work or verbal act" (p. 518) leads me to assume that he would not object to some such speculations if used in a way not designed to act as a "strategy of containment" that reduces a</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 405 text exclusively to such a grounding. Contrasting language as a social product (hence essentially collective) with such purely "genetic" divisive- ness, I locate the beginnings of "the rhetorical situation" in attempts to establish identifications atop this rudimentary partisanship. In any case, I present the matter specifically in terms of considerations of "ideology" (A Rhetoric ofMotives, pp. 145-49), though I can imagine that many Marxists might object to the notion of the body as the human, symbol-using animal's "prime economic plant." The six pages (pp. 105-10) following my seven definitions explicitly summarize The German Ideology viewed from the standpoint of its salient value to my concerns in A Rhetoric of Motives. I herewith summarize those pages. First of all, there is the all-important point about reversal, a twist of symbolism that takes many forms (many, but not all of which I'd incline to interpret along Marxist lines); it centers here in the attack upon the Hegelian "theodicy" according to which history is the Unfolding of the Absolute Idea. By dealing with ideas in their "pure" form rather than as instruments of the ruling classes with which they are identified, an ideologist can get things backwards, viewing the ideas as though they were acts of self-determination. But this "mystical appearance" can be demolished by throwing out "the self-developing concept" and putting in its place progressive "self-consciousness." Thus instead of Hegelian "mystifications" we confront a sequence of ideologists who are to be viewed as the historical representatives of various "concepts." "Illusions" or "mystification" result when terms such as "conscious- ness" or "the human essence" are featured, whereas the typical conflicts of society are rooted in property relations. Empires striving for world markets become "ideologically" viewed in terms of "universal spirit." Thus "an uncriticized idea of 'the nation' is as thoroughly an ideology, in the Marxist sense, as any Hegelian talk of the Absolute" (p. 108). We should look for "mystification" at any point where the social divisiveness caused by property and the division of labor is obscured by unitary terms. "All told, 'ideology' is equatable with illusion, mystification, discus- sion of human relations in terms like absolute consciousness, honor, loyalty, justice, freedom, substance, essence of man-in short, that 'in- version' whereby material history is derived from 'spirit' (in contrast with the method of dialectical materialism whereby the changing nature of consciousness would be derived from changes in material conditions)" (p. 110). By the same token, I'd add now: the changes in material con- ditions of the body (from sickness to health, or vice versa) will be man- ifest as changes in the "nature of consciousness." I also referred (p. 109) to that sportive conceit, if there ever was one, which "pictures man under communism" as "shifting from job to job like a Jack-of-all-trades, as the mood strikes him (hunting in the morning, fishing in the afternoon, rearing cattle in the evening, and criticizing</page><page sequence="6">406 Critical Response Kenneth Burke after dinner, 'without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd, or critic')." My views on technological specialization and bureaucratization never did fit that "promise," but I quoted it. Also, I add some "Terminis- tic Reservations (in View of Cromwell's Motives)" (pp. 110-14). There I show how, if you but put "God" or "Providence" in place of "the objec- tive situation," Cromwell's notion of the "necessity" imposed by Provi- dence follows in quite the same groove; for the "documentary survival" of a term "after the death of its historical context might make it seem to have been much more 'spiritual' than it actually was." "If a tribe is living by a river, and has adapted its entire way of life to the conditions of that river, it might sum up its motives in the name of what we would call a 'river god.' Yet such a title would not be a mere animistic superstition; there would be much realistic and materialisticjustification for it." And if the overall "titular" term which we might call the tribe's "god" served as the nominal pretext for the offices of an administrative priesthood, there is the analogous situation in the case of a political party in the name of which its administrators are organized. The distinction between ideas as causes and ideas as caused doesn't look quite so clear if, along logological lines, one views both a title like "Providence" and a title like "dialectical materialism" as "god-terms." But I have developed that sort of specula- tion more fully elsewhere. I can but say here that I did discuss it, in terms of "ideology." But my main nonexhibit is still to be cited. There is no reference by Jameson at all to a chapter entitled "Marx on 'Mystification' " (pp. 101- 10), which is matched by a chapter entitled "Carlyle on 'Mystery' " (pp. 114-23). Marx considers thumbs-down what Carlyle considers thumbs- up. This omission is especially "strategic" because those pages are the most direct answer of all to Jameson's characterization (p. 521) concern- ing Burke's "fundamental hesitation to identify his own study of sym- bolic forms with any of the available strategies of demystification, or of what we have today, following Ricoeur, come to call negative hermeneu- tics, or the hermeneutics of suspicion." But there is a footnote (p. 522): "for Burke's position on demystification and negative hermeneutics, see 'The Virtues and Limitations of Debunking,' The Philosophy of Literary Form, pp. 168-90." Not only is the reader not told how any of that fits in, but Jameson further selects something which was written in the thirties, before, to my knowledge, it was possible for Burke, like Jameson, to be "following Ricoeur." The same pattern is strictly pursued on the subject of the "uncon- scious." On page 522 Jameson tells us that, "confronted with the great forerunners of ideological analysis, the great explorers of the uncon- scious proper, with Marx or Freud or Nietzsche, Burke's inclination is simply to apply to their own insights the sorting mechanism of his modal typology." On the same page there is a qualifying footnote: "The point is not the absence of the terms from Burke's writing, but rather of the type</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 407 of diagnostic or symptomal analysis to which they correspond. In fact, the concept of the unconscious is discussed at some length in an essay like 'Mind, Body, and the Unconscious,' Language as Symbolic Action (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1966), pp. 63-80." Not one word is cited to indicate what is wrong with this "typology" and how Jameson's "ideol- ogy" would "reread" and "rewrite" the eight "varieties of unconscious" I list there, plus my five dogs (primal, jingle, lexical, tautological, and en- telechial), and my rules for deriving "the Freudian terminology, viewed as a dialectical structure spun from its own internal principles of organi- zation." My sixth category of "unconscious," by the way, impinges upon "the sheerly terministic situation whereby any 'conscious' nomenclature gives rise to a corresponding realm of the 'unconscious.' ... In Marx's scheme, 'class consciousness' greatly overlaps upon what we might well call 'class unconsciousness.' For instance: By Marx's scheme, if the bourgeois con- ceives of all mankind in terms of the bourgeois, said bourgeois has un- consciously represented (or revealed) his bourgeois consciousness." In Language as Symbolic Action (pp. 329-30), on the subject of "Con- scious and Unconscious," I describe a sonnet which I had intended to be quite solemn, but which, several months later, I analyzed as possessing a quite grotesque double meaning. We might put it thus: though the poet consciously intended his sonnet on the sinking of Atlantis to be on the slope ofpathos, he discovered (partly to his amusement, partly in vexation) that it had an unintended dimension of bathos; and I cite some memories indicating that my relations to the poem's "problematical" aspect were on the edge of the "pre-conscious" from the start. Actually, in concerns of this sort, the line between the implicit and the explicit being so wavering, there are many cases Where the dis- tinctions between conscious and unconscious become correspondingly blurred. But the kind of methodological repression (or variant of the Quietus) that is implicit in Jameson's hermeneutic model can be wasteful beyond necessity. For it encourages him to be so precociously prompt in his "rereading" of a text that he doesn't allow his readers to read a single sentence of it. He doesn't tell them what Sinn, in its own terms, my text has on the subject of "ideology," "mystification," and the "unconscious." Instead he cuts corners and settles for a report of the Bedeutung (see Jameson, p. 516) that it has for him. In this case the procedure is particu- larly wasteful because Jameson is highly intelligent, and if it weren't for the bad leads of his model he's the last man in the world who would have to be so bluntly inaccurate as he is on this occasion. I believe that he could put me through quite a trying ordeal if he could have but kept on the subject and pursued me accordingly. The subject involves my announcement of a "new dispensation" that would complement the classical rhetorical term "persuasion" by adding my post-Marxist, post-Freudian term, "identification," which I explicitly</page><page sequence="8">408 Critical Response Kenneth Burke tie in with his term "ideology," though quite possibly in ways to him unpardonable. Though my application of the term is developed throughout the book, I'll now settle for representative sentences from my chapter on the " 'Socioanagogic' Interpretation of Venus and Adonis" (A Rhetoric of Motives, pp. 212-21). I originally chose this poem as a kind of challenge. When young I had devoured it in a mood ardently erotic. But on the basis of my concerns in A Rhetoric of Motives, I returned to it with the idea of analyzing this "story of sexual courtship" for its traces of "implicit social identifications." I shall quote the portions that most di- rectly give the drift. Our major concern is to discuss the poem in terms of hierarchy. ... ... one should view this poem in terms of the social order, as befits any inquiry into the rhetoric of courtship.... ... The vocabularies of social and sexual courtship are so readily interchangeable, not because one is a mere "substitute" for the other, but because sexual courtship is intrinsically fused with the motives of social hierarchy. ... We do not assume that the poem's concealment of a social allegory in a sexual enigma was consciously contrived.... These identifications can be implicit, and "unconscious." ... by combining Marx and Carlyle, with hints from Empson, we should at least see how right the medievalist was in his convic- tion that the poet's symbols are enigmatic, that they stand for a hidden realm, a mystery (though its "divinity," like that of the Roman Emperor or "Pontifex Maximus" of a secular realm, may be de- rived from a social hierarchy). Even the world of natural objects, as they figure in poetry, must have secret "identifications" with the judgments of status. (Thus, music and leisure by the sea are profoundly mood-laden, bringing as they do the culmination of social order to confront the abyss of an ultimate order.) The veil of Maya is woven of the strands of hierarchy-and the poet's topics glow through the mist. By "socioanagogic" interpretation we mean the search for such implicit identifications. Though admitting that one can go far wrong in the particular here, we would insist that such analysis is demanded "in principle." . . . "Socioanagogic" interpretation would seem to be the name for the Marxist insight, if one sought a "neutral" approach midway between Marx's rage against "mys- tification" and Carlyle's adulation of "mystery." The chapter ends on explicit reference to "the four medieval kinds of interpretation" as defined in Aquinas' Summa Theologica. Such a "Dramatistic" (or, if you will, "neomedieval") view of worldly identifications as a "pageantry" may be "ideological" in a way not at all to Jameson's liking. But if so, the proper procedure would be not to regret the absence of the word but rather to bear down upon what he</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 409 might well want to dismiss for its brand of "ideology," which I would characterize as an ironic wavering, ultimately reducible to the individu- al's composite nature that "bridges" (perhaps as a pontifex minimus?) the realms of physiological, nonsymbolic motion and socially conditioned symbolic action. If Jameson wants to present my case purely in his terms (giving his Bedeutung at the expense of my Sinn) there are many situa- tions that might not allow for any objection in principle. But such would not apply to this case. For my book specifically presents its term "iden- tification" in the light of his term "ideology." Under those circumstances, how can he possibly resolve that issue by the kind of Quietus that is implicit in his own choice of terms as distinct from mine? If, under those conditions, his model encourages him simply to ignore my way of devel- oping the term "ideology" and to "dispose of" the issue by regretting my "strange reluctance" to use the term as often as he would, does that speak well for his model? As for Jameson's quickie (p. 522) where I am summarily ruled out on the grounds that Nietzsche's "insights" are but subjected to the "sort- ing mechanisms" of my "modal typology" (a "rewriting" that cites not a single statement of mine), I have both quarrelled with Nietzsche and paid him tribute. I would but point out that the middle section of my early book, Permanence and Change (1935; rev. ed., Los Altos, Calif., 1959), is built around the concept of "perspective by incongruity," which I so named when having in mind the term "perspective," as fea- tured in Nietzsche's Will to Power. I there analyze his usage in the light of his propensity to cultivate a style that puts together terms usually thought of as mutually exclusive. Often that twist can startle by giving new insights. The device can become trivial, mere irresponsible smart- ness slapped out by city-slickers. With Nietzsche it was manifested in an almost rapaciously insistent effort to perfect an untergrabend "transvalua- tion of all values." The kind of verbal atom smashing in Remy de Gour- mont's (for me traumatic) essay on "The Dissociation of Ideas" (which I discuss on pages 149-54 of my Rhetoric of Motives) was obviously written under Nietzsche's influence. Somewhat behavioristically, I hold to the notion that, in Nietzsche's case, the zeal of his nihilistic evangelism was ultimately grounded in a sense of the human organism's inborn equip- ment for the enduring of stress, a potentiality that becomes a demand (though, as with Heraclitus, the idea of stress gets lost behind the idea of war, at which point Nietzsche can be admired by the wrong people). The passages on Nietzsche involving both the stylistic and the temperamental aspects of the case are in Permanence and Change (pp. 88-92, 197-98). On page 92, when discussing "planned incongruity" in Bergson, I say that "Nietzsche exemplfied the procedure consistently enough-but he didn't, to my knowledge, give us a specific rationalization of it." I had</page><page sequence="10">410 Critical Response Kenneth Burke in mind here the stylistic aspect of his perspectives. I have since learned of my error (see references to Nietzsche in Beda Allemann's essay, "Metaphor and Antimetaphor" [Interpretation: The Poetry of Meaning, ed. Stanley Romain Hopper and David L. Miller (New York, 1967)]). If Jameson decides that I'm quite off the track, he might show in detail why, rather than simply grading my paper without further ado. One further instance of the "repression" pattern: on page 523 Jameson in parting observes that Burke "did not want to teach us his- tory, even though he wanted to teach us how to grapple with it." In case Jameson is talking about my Attitudes toward History (though it is not mentioned, and I can't blame him if he hasn't seen it, for it's caught in a publishers' Quietus of its own), I might say: being built around the somewhat indeterminately polar attitudes of acceptance and rejection, my book is stronger on attitude than on history. I say "indeterminately" because acceptance of something implies the rejection of something else, or vice versa. Hence the distinction is far from being as clean-cut as a yes-or-no answer to a question whether a sum in simple arithmetic is correctly added. As I see the situation, we can have but attitudes toward whatever of history is either past or not yet here. And much the same situation prevails even now when a critic's book subscribes to an activist philoso- phy of history that prophesies a world political revolution (or, it turns out, a lot of little local revolutions) designed to change the world even more radically than is the case with the ever-mounting realm of counter- nature brought progressively into being by the industrial revolution in its purely technological aspects. In any case, the book does tell about history to the extent of a fifty-page outline called "The Curve of History" and subdividing our West- ern tradition thus: Act 1. Evangelical Christianity emerging out of dying, pagan Rome. Act. 2. Medieval Synthesis. Act 3. Protestantism. Act 4. Early Capitalism. Act 5. Collectivism, as imposed in some form or other by the conditions of modern technology and accountancy, encompassing such a variety of polities as Fascism, "Police States," socialism, communism, the "Wel- fare State," and the giant industrial corporations which are typical of our own nation at the present time (and which have aptly been called "business governments," as distinct from strictly "political govern- ments"). [Obviously now that last phase is being "perfected" by the multinational corporations and their computer-guided "global" grasp of local economic situations.] Although there is no reason to question the great amount of evi-</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 411 dence that traces religious patterns of thought back through their histor- ical past, my logological theory of language situates the origin of religion in a situation that is ever born anew, namely: the relation of a child to its parents (or other elders) when it is emerging from infancy (speechless- ness) into familiarity with the highly alembicated nomenclature clustered around the idea of mortality, a nomenclature also involving the "spirit world" of dreams. The relation of dependent child to adults as "higher powers" is "perfected" in the relation of dependent adults to a corre- spondingly "projected" imagined realm of "higher powers." Here again, as with my point about the individuality of the human body, the underlying "economic situation" is "natural," biological, not due to human inventions; but it is, of course, strongly influenced by them. Where matters of symbolicity are concerned, I would hold that strictly historicist views of human institutions can be misleading. Logol- ogy would see in religious patterns of thought (as the symbolic "perfect- ing" of nonsymbolic nature) an entelechial principle implicit in language at any time (though such a statement of the case would not establish their "objective" validity other than in this purely "formal" sense, plus their role in the control or would-be control of human relations). Thus Jameson's ingenious analysis (pp. 516-18) of my essay "Sym- bolic Action in a Poem by Keats" (A Grammar of Motives [1945; rpt. Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1974]), pictures me as trying to solve prob- lems that I had no notion of. He refers to "the prestidigitation, the intellectual acrobatics" by which I "managed to square" a "particular circle," which he describes as efforts toward "saving the arch-romantic Keats from the inevitable contamination of that romanticism which for the generation of the New Critics vitiated poets like Shelley or Swin- burne." But here's all I thought I was doing: in my works generally (even when discussing such an "ideological" exhibit as Hitler's Mein Kampf) I have laid great stress upon the study of symbolic constructs that lend themselves readily to analysis as embodying secular traces of reli- gious patterns. And when writing of Keats' "Ode on a Grecian Urn," all that I thought I was doing was analyzing an exceptionally well-put- together art-heaven, as per my references to such matters in my "Motion/Action" essay (pp. 830-32). With regard to Jameson's notion that Burke evolves "a strategy of containment, a substitution designed to arrest the movement of ideolog- ical analysis before it can begin to draw in the social, historical, and political parameters which are the ultimate horizon of every cultural artifact," the ironic fact is that my method of analysis is designed to strike a balance between the New Critics' stress upon the particular work in itself and Jameson's "ideological" stress upon "the ultimate horizon of every cultural artifact." The text, as a particular instance of symbolic action, should be closely studied for its implicit and explicit equations, plus their trans-</page><page sequence="12">412 Critical Response Kenneth Burke formations. Its internal relations would be studied as though "anony- mous." But the text should also be analyzed from the standpoint of "symbolic action in general," ideally with knowledge of the author as citizen and taxpayer, of his ailments, of his "property in" the economy of his times, of all and any contextual bits of "facticity" that might be shown to bear upon his text, considered as a symbolic act. With inquiries into the nature of symbolic action in general, it is proper to introduce refer- ence to any local condition that can be proved relevant to the analysis of the act. True, in accordance with my theories of "symbolic action in gen- eral," I would call any "historicist" ideology like Jameson's an implicit "strategy of containment" to the extent that it deflects attention from the kind of considerations I have presented in my "Motion/Action" essay. But I could not object in principle, though I might object in details, to any such analysis as Jameson calls for. My only objections in principle could be to any inadequacies in his analysis of the work as an internally organized text, and to corresponding neglect of the field in which the study of "symbolic action in general" does not attain the degree of gen- eralization proper to its subject-matter, which could be considered "prior" to all examples, at any stage of history, that fall under that head. As for Burke's "desperate and ambitious attempt, in the Grammar and Rhetoric of Motives, to endow the American capitalism of the thirties and early forties with its appropriate cultural and political ideology" (Jameson, p. 520), I work on the assumption that no political system yet devised is adequate to the problem of controlling the great virtues of technology and their troublous side effects, though there is an "ideologi- cal" style of bookkeeping whereby all the actual ills of technology are attributed to capitalism and all the promised rewards are attributed to socialism. I take it for granted that speculations of humanistic cast must adopt, as a modus vivendi, "a kind of 'Neo-Stoic resignation' to the needs of industrial expansion" (Grammar of Motives, p. 442). On the next page of the Grammar I called it "an attitude of hypochondriasis: the attitude of a patient who makes peace with his symptoms by becoming interested in them," by an "attitude of appreciation" which "would seek delight in meditating upon some of the many ingenuities of speech." I can well understand why this position might fall far short of the stance that Jameson's ideology would demand of us. On this point I hope to say more later. Meanwhile, there are a couple of minor matters to be dis- posed of. With regard to "ritual" (Jameson, p. 519), here is another clear instance of the difference between Jameson's approach to history in terms of ideology and my approach in terms of Logology. Jameson's point is: it would seem "misguided, not to say historically naive, to attribute a Parsonian stability and functionality of the former primitive or tribal type to a social formation whose inner logic is the restless and</page><page sequence="13">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 413 corrosive dissolution of traditional social relations into the atomized and quantified aggregates of the market system." For that condition is quite unlike the kind of collective situation in which the "ritual function of primitive art" developed. Hence, Jameson considers it but a "strategy of containment" to deal with our world in such terms. This is a good point. And I can go along with it to the extent that, in my Rhetoric of Motives (p. 41) I complained that Cassirer's Myth of the State has a misleading title; for "the book is really about nothing more nor less than a most charac- teristic concern of rhetoric: the manipulation of men's beliefs for politi- cal ends." But my section on "The General Nature of Ritual" in Attitudes toward History, is most concerned with ritualization arising perennially anew, largely out of contemporary bureaucratizations, since I am specifically con- cerned with the indeterminate shifts between ritual and routine. History can show different transformations of ritual in the modes of symbolic action. But in the logological perspective, the tendency itself is not a mere "sur- vival" nor is it likely to be "abolished," as is routinely or ritualistically promised of the classless society in the Marxist dialectic. As for the "concept of the self or subject" (Jameson, p. 520), the position I develop in my "Motion/Action" article (pp. 809-30) was already stated in my Grammar. I have also indicated in what sense I would not call the "centrality" of the "self" (as a separate organism pos- sessing immediate sensations not thus shared in their immediacy by other organisms) a mere "optical illusion," though I would grant that the individual, as a "person," dissolves into quite a complexity of identifica- tions in the sociopolitical realm. On one point we are wholly in agreement (in fact, more in agree- ment than Jameson's investment in his particular ideology would permit him to agree with). I refer to the place (p. 522) where Jameson charac- terizes the "dramatistic paradigm" as an instance of "anthropomor- phism." Logology, my style, freely grants the charge. But when one man-made nomenclature accuses another man-made nomenclature of being anthropomorphic, if the accusation is intended to imply that the accusant nomenclature is not anthropomorphic, at that point my brand of Logology likens such ideological behavior to the verbal tactics of the politician who would imply his purity by accusing another politician of playing politics. In its way, that line is as brand-new an invention as young love. To be trafficking in any human symbol-system is, by the same token, to be engaged in a typically anthropomorphic enterprise. Many people incline to think that reduction of nature to terms of such a man-made dialectic as mathematics is a way of getting us outside our nature. But what animal other than the human organism, as modified by its specifically human aptitude for symbol-systems, would try to understand an expression such as Einstein's "E = MC2"-</page><page sequence="14">414 Critical Response Kenneth Burke True, many "ideological" constructs should be charged with the kind of illusory reversal that The German Ideology is exercised about. The pattern at its purest is to be seen in cases of eponymy, as when the etymological derivation of Romulus from Roma becomes the mythic der- ivation of Rome from Romulus as its founder. But however things fare with Hegel's account of the Absolute Idea unfolding its dialectical logic through history, and however many other cases there are for which the Marxist analytic instrument is the perfect fit, a logological study of this situation throws light upon an intermediate realm which is closed to Jameson's ideologico-historicist approach. Once the human organism has developed, by physiological muta- tions, the ability to impose a strong anthropomorphic imprint upon the nonhuman "context of situation" in which humanity developed, the mere postulate that this aptitude for symbolic action is grounded in nonsymbolic (and by the same token nonhuman) nature does not imply that such a realm of symbolicity cannot be an originating force in its own right. Its "ideas" (Logology would prefer to say its "terms") are not merely "derived" from material conditions; they are positively "creative" of material conditions. In this sense, a theory of "consciousness" as his- torically conditioned would not be accurate enough. Rather, we must study the "human condition" from a theory of terminology in general. Let's go to the very center of the issue, namely: the relation between "natural" powers and "technological" power. "Natural" powers can do only what they are doing. If it can rain, it is raining. If all that nature could bring about in a certain region at a certain time is a state of drought, there is the irrefutable evidence, an actual state of drought. When there can be an earthquake, there is an earthquake. Nature "un- aided" can manifest only the combination of conditions that add up to exactly what they do add up to in relation to one another. But introduce the symbol-guided techniques of technology, and nature can be made to undergo quite startling anthropomorphizing transfor- mations. Unaided nature, under present conditions, couldn't have pro- duced our present vast arsenals of atomic bombs. Such instruments could not have been brought into existence ("created") without the savoir-faire of human prowess, which has thus in effect been sculpting its self-image in the materials of nonhuman nature, in effect leaving signs everywhere announcing, "Kingkill Kilroy was here." By placing the whole stress upon the flat distinction between super- natural and natural terms for discussing the "descent of man," Dar- winism deflected attention from the critical distinction between human animals and other animals, a distinction which, though grounded in the human animal's sheer physiology, made possible the realm of technolog- ical counter-nature, which began to take form with the first innovations of instruments and corresponding methods but has developed at a greatly accelerating rate since the start of the industrial revolution (page</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 415 Henry Adams on the "law of the acceleration of history" given the turn from the "Virgin" to the "Dynamo"). The pronounced Marxist antithesis between idealistic and mate- rialistic derivations can have much the same effect. To start not, as per the Communist Manifesto, with the class struggle but with the "prime" logological (and Socratic?) question, "What is it to be the typically symbol-using animal?" could only be viewed as "ideology" in Jameson's thumbs-down sense, even though such a position could go along with much that Marx says about the class struggle. But the flat opposition between "ideas" as derivative in the Marxist genealogy and formative in Hegel's invites a kind of "genetic fallacy" whereby overstress upon the origins of some manifestation can deflect attention from what it is, re- gardless of what it came from. The difference between technological power and raw natural power is per se evidence of the way in which the transforming potentialities of symbolism's "ideas" can "transcend" nature without being either or- thodoxly supernatural or rooted in a Hegelian Absolute. The adjective "dialectical," added to the noun "materialism," can serve to make room for the shift between "ideas" as derivative and as formative but in a way that (viewed logologically) functions as a mere "strategy of containment" for the issue is not explicitly confronted. Though the change from the human organism's wholly "natural" condition, as an animal like other animals, began with the most primitive uses of language in assisting the development of tools and in reinforcing the imitation of new procedures, I would assume that only within the last two centuries the implementing of such inventiveness (culminating in laboratory techniques for the ever more efficient invention of further inventiveness) has produced a revolutionary explosion in the corre- sponding realm of counter-nature (usually referred to as the ability of humankind henceforth to guide its own evolution rather than being subject to the instincts and laws of natural selection which Darwin studied and which Marx heralded as the rise of "new needs" under modem methods of production). I call that a realm of "counter-nature" in the sense that, if all such man-made equipment were suddenly gone, you'd have to try making a living under "natural" conditions, though we be- come accustomed to our "unnatural" ways as a kind of "second nature." Once our kind of physiological organism emerges from infancy (speechlessness) into familiarity with a symbol-system such as a tribal language (the logological equivalent of Jameson's Marxist "conscious- ness") it is characterized by a property, or faculty, that infuses all experi- ence with its human nature-whence the "anthropomorphism" inherent in what, over half a century ago, I quaintly called "the thing added-the little white houses in a valley that was once a wilderness." By identifying such symbolic prowess with an "entelechial principle" I have in mind the notion that inherent in it there is the incentive to "perfect" itself by</page><page sequence="16">416 Critical Response Kenneth Burke covering more and more ground. For such a potentiality is saying in effect: "Whatever the nonverbal, there are words for it, ranging all the way from the technically, scientifically couched analysis of a situation or process to a sheer expression of attitude, as with the poet's feeling that spring requires completion in a springsong, or a devout believer's "ges- ture" of reverence in his symbolic act of prayer. I don't think that Jameson did at all well by my discussions of the term "Purpose" (the rudiments of which I would ground in the sheerly physiological needs for food, shelter, sex, etc., but the "anthropomor- phic" range of which is the empirical equivalent of unfinishedness, what used to be called humanity's "divine discontent"). On the side of sym- bolism, it all begins with the purely formal fact that a sentence is fully a sentence only insofar as it has a meaning, and such a meaning is its purpose. So we start from there and aim to endow everything in nature with the kind of "meaningfulness" that a sentence has. But maybe I can't complain. For the pragmatic perfecting of the en- telechial principle itself in terms of mediation (Vermittlung) by in- geniously extending the realm of counter-nature ever farther into the realm of nonsymbolic nature is (take your choice) either an overall human purpose, particularly in its attendant needs to worry about its side effects, or a kind of neo-Schopenhauerean compulsion. Here figure eschatological inducements to favor "perfect" dialectical designs such as the promise and/or threat to make the distinction between good guys and bad guys go on forever, with corresponding rewards and punish- ments; or there is the differently but equally "perfect" post-Hegelian Marxist design whereby the dialectic pattern "abolishes itself." When contemplating such resources, all that Logology can say is: any such schemes are in the realm of anthropomorphic counter-nature in- sofar as they are human constructs and are thus able to put forth doctri- nal statements of one sort or another. And to our knowledge, no other organism on earth so "behaves." If we discover that other organisms do, we'll move over. But in any case and in the meantime, Logology as I dramatistically subscribe to it must confront history, first of all, not in propagandist terms of class struggle, but in terms of the question, "What is it to be the typically symbol-using animal?"-a question that can welcome the topic of class struggle as a notable contribution to the cause but that must begin with, start from, something along the lines of what I was aiming at in my would-be Nietzschean etiology of the concept, "perspective by in- congruity," including its tie-in with the stress angle, physiologically in- herited from way back. Without an appreciatively ironic view of specifically human striv- ings, my notions on the subject of "anthropomorphization" . . . Well, I leave the sentence unfinished, for I don't know.</page></plain_text>
